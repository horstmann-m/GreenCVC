The Group
Overview

1.1. Overview

Orange is one of the world’s leading telecommunications operators
with revenues of 41 billion euros and 155,000 employees worldwide
(including 96,000 in France) at December 31, 2016. With operations
in 29 countries, the Group served 263 million customers at
December 31, 2016. Orange is also a leading provider of tele-
communication services to multinational companies, under the brand
Orange Business Services. In March 2015, the Group presented its

History

Orange, formerly France Télécom, is France's incumbent tele-
communications operator. The Group has its origins in the Ministry for
Mail, Telegraphs and Telephone, later to become the General
Directorate of Telecommunications, which in 1990 was accorded the
status of independent public entity and, on January 1, 1991, renamed
France Télécom. On December 31, 1996, France Télécom became
a Société anonyme (limited company). In October 1997, France
Télécom shares were listed on the Paris and New York stock
exchanges, allowing the French government the disposal of 25% of
its shares to the public and Group employees. Subsequently, the
public sector gradually reduced its holding to 53%. The law of
December 31, 2003 authorized the transfer of the Company to the
private sector and between 2004 and 2008 the public sector sold a
further 26% of the capital, and then again 4% in 2014 and 2015. At
December 31, 2016, the French State retained 22.95% of the share
capital, held either directly or jointly with Bpifrance Participations.

France Télécom’s area of activity and its regulatory and competitive
environment have undergone significant changes since the 1990s. In
a context of increased deregulation and competition, between 1999
and 2002, the Group pursued a strategy of developing new services
and accelerated its international growth with a number of strategic
investments. These included, in particular, acquiring the mobile
operator Orange and the Orange brand, which had been created in
1994, and taking a controlling stake in Poland's incumbent operator,
Telekomunikacja Polska.

In 2002, France Télécom started a large-scale refinancing plan for its
debt to reinforce its balance sheet, as well as an operational
improvements program, the success of which has allowed the Group
to develop a global integrated-operator strategy by anticipating
changes in the telecommunications industry.

Since 2005, the Group has expanded strategically in Spain by
acquiring the mobile operator Amena, then in 2015 the fixed-line
operator Jazztel. Accounting for over 12% of consolidated revenues
in 2016, Spain is the Group's second largest country.

new strategic plan, Essentials2020, which focuses on its customers’
expectations to ensure that they experience the best of the digital world
and the power of its very high-speed broadband networks.

Orange has been listed since 1997 on Euronext Paris (symbol: ORA)
and on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: ORAN).

In parallel, the Group streamlined its asset portfolio by selling off non-
strategic subsidiaries and holdings.

Over the last ten years, the Group has pursued a policy of selective,
value-creating acquisitions by concentrating on the markets in which
it is already present.

Mainly targeting the emerging markets of Africa and the Middle-East
where the Group is historically present (in particular Cameroon, Ivory
Coast, Guinea, Jordan, Mali and Senegal), this strategy was
implemented through the acquisition of Mobinil in Egypt (2010) and
of Médi Télécom in Morocco (2015) and more recently by the
acquisition of a number of African operators (in Liberia, Burkina Faso,
Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) (2016).

It also resulted in the joint venture with Deutsche Telekom that
combined UK activities under the EE brand (2010) followed by the
disposal of EE in 2016, as well as the disposal of Orange Suisse
(2012), Orange Dominicana (2014), Orange Armenia (2015) and
Telkom Kenya (2016).

As part of its strategy, the Group is also developing its mobile financial
services activities, in particular payment services, and in 2016 took
over the Groupama Banque, which has become Orange Bank.

In 2006, Orange became the Group's single brand for Internet,
television and mobile services in most countries where the Group
operates, in particular in Spain where all activities have been
combined into a single entity operating under the Orange brand. This
single brand policy continued with the adoption of the Orange brand
by Telekomunikacja Polska in 2013, then by Mobinil in Egypt, Mobistar
in Belgium and Méditel in Morocco in 2016. Enterprise services in the
world are offered under the brand Orange Business Services.

In 2013, the Company adopted the corporate name Orange.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
The world information and communication technologies market

This chapter contains forward-looking statements, particularly in
Section 2.3 The Orange group strategy. These forward-looking
statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in

The world information and

communication technologies market

2016 was marked by continued global growth in the information and
communication technologies (ICT) industry, which mainly includes the
sectors of computing, audiovisual, equipment, Internet and
telecommunications. Following the recovery witnessed in 2014, and
in 2015, ICT revenues continued to grow in 2016 at a rate of +3.9%
(+0.1 point compared with 2015), to reach 3,978 billion euros
worldwide.

Market growth by region

The ICT market remains an essential component of economic growth,
and represents an important source of value creation through the
distribution of new services and new uses.

Revenues of telecom services, which amounted to 1,130 billion euros
at the end of 2016, grew at a slightly higher rate of +1.7%, albeit ata
slower rate than that of ICT services as a whole (+3.9%).

The ICT market grew in 2016 at different speeds depending on the
geographical area: +3.4% for North America, +2.2% for Europe,
+5.0% for Asia Pacific and +7.3% for Africa & Middle-East. The
Africa & Middle-East region continues to offer the best growth
prospects for the ICT market. Emerging countries as a whole, which
account for just over one third of the world market, contributed more
than half of its growth in value (source: Idate).

Africa & Middle-East

In 2016, the growth of the ICT market remained high at +7.3%, while
the continent's economic growth was virtually stable at +2.7%
(compared with +2.5% in 2015). The potential of this region in which
the Orange group is very present remains strong, both in terms of
equipment and access infrastructure. Telecom services, which
account for 43% of the ICT market, grew by +2.9%, above the world
market as a whole, but lower compared with 2013 and 2014, and
now growing at a lower rate than the Asia Pacific region. The share of
revenues of telecom services of the world market, which totaled
102 billion euros, or 9%, remains among the weakest compared with
the other regions of the world.

South America

In spite of the advanced maturity of services, the dynamics of the
development of equipment and uses remains strong. The ICT market
is growing at a higher rate compared with 2016, at +5.1%. Telecom
services represent 36% of the ICT market with a growth rate of +2.5%
in 2016. Revenues of telecom services reached 102 billion euros,
representing 9% of the world market.

Asia Pacific

This region, which includes both advanced economies and emerging
countries, posted high GDP growth rates, particularly in China (+6.6%).

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
The world information and communication technologies market

Growth of the ICT market, valued at 1,191 billion euros in 2016,
stabilized at +5%. Revenues of telecom services reached 372 billion
euros in 2016, a growth of +3.1%, and represent 33% of the world
market, the largest share of all regions worldwide. In this region,
telecom services still represent almost a third of ICT revenues, in spite
of growth remaining unchanged at +3.1% in 2015 and in 2016.

Europe

In 2016, revenues of European telecom services began to grow again,
with an increase of +0.2% compared with 2015, after five years of
decline from 2010 to 2015 (-1.9% in 2014 and -0.6% in 2015). Europe
remains the least dynamic region of the world in terms of growth, and
its weight in the world telecoms market now only represents 24%,
behind Asia Pacific and North America (source: Idate).

North America

In 2016, the ICT market witnessed a slight growth, from +3.1% to
+3.4%, in a context where North American GDP growth declined
markedly, from +2.5% in 2015 to +1.5% in 2016. The region saw
renewed growth in telecom services, with the market, which fell -1%
in 2015, growing by 0.5% in 2016.

In 2016, revenues of telecom services reached 285 billion euros,
representing 25% of the world market.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
The world information and communication technologies market

Key trends and changes

The slowdown in the growth of telecommunications services, with
three consecutive years around 1% (compared with 3% in 2012), is
due to the slowdown in the mobile phone market. The development
of very high-speed fixed broadband and mobile and the high
penetration of smartphones worldwide, lead to a growing demand for
bandwidth. Data traffic should therefore double between 2016 and
2019. The momentum of the ICT sector is now driven mainly by
Internet services which contributed two-thirds of growth in 2016
compared with 12% for telecom services (Source: Idate).

Convergence of services
and market consolidation

Convergence, which allows operators with both fixed and mobile
network infrastructures to compete against operators with only fixed
or mobile infrastructures, continues to grow, particularly in Europe.
This convergence has led to the development of so-called
“quadruplay” offers (voice, Internet, television, mobile), as well as the
growing use of WiFi in mobile networks. As regards cable operators,
they also include WiFi in their offers to thwart quadruplay offers from
telecoms operators and, in the United States, they are showing a
growing interest for mobile operators.

In Europe, the consolidation trend, which in 2014-2015 gave rise to
mergers between telecoms operators, and addressed the needs for
convergence or for the reduction of the number of mobile operators,
slowed down. In 2016, in Italy, Illiad positioned itself in mobile services
via an agreement signed with Hutchison and Vimpelcom, while in
Spain Masmovil acquired 100% of Yoigo, thus creating the
4th convergent operator after Telefonica, Orange Spain and Vodafone.
In the United Kingdom, the European Commission, concerned about
adverse effects on competition, did not allow the merger between
Three (Hutchison group) and O2 (Telefonica group).

However, cable operators continued their acquisitions, in particular
Liberty Global and Altice.

As evidenced by some recent trends, the convergence of telecoms
and content operators is a feature specific to North American and UK
markets. In the USA, AT&T is thus planning to acquire the media
group Time Warner, which owns the television chains HBO and CNN
(transaction subject to approval by the authorities). In the United
Kingdom, BT has acquired football rights to counter Sky, a satellite
TV package.

In Europe, the rise in the amounts payable for rights of access to
contents is leading operators to get organized and take action to
make convergence a success and offer their customers the best
audiovisual contents. Orange in Spain has acquired the broadcasting
rights of La Liga’s most important football matches in the country. In
France, SFR has announced a new organizational structure bringing
together all the group's media activities (press, radio, TV and sport).

Verizon, which was trying to acquire Yahoo to make it number 3 of
the digital advertising market, may desist following data piracy issues.

Network development and growth
in telecommunication uses worldwide

In Africa & Middle — East, Internet access networks are developing
mainly via the deployment of mobile networks, whereas in Europe
investments in networks are concentrated in very high-speed
broadband access, with the development of fixed-line offers on fiber

Orange / 2016 Registration Document

referred to as FTTH (Fiber-to-the-Home) and the deployment of 4G
mobile networks. In parallel, operators are developing their networks
to make them more agile and simpler to manage (with “virtualization”
and more open (with API). Usage is exploding under the combined
effect of the deployment of new networks, the increase in capacity of
existing networks and the growth in the penetration rate of
increasingly sophisticated mobile handsets (smartphones). The
explosion in usage is mainly driven by video accessible via a multitude
of screens (computers, smartphones, tablets, readers, connected
TVs, connected watches). Furthermore, the development of low
power wide area (LPWA) network technologies will lead to an increase
in the number of connected objects.

Consumer and company expectations

Digital technologies continue to permeate all areas of daily life: family,
home, well-being, entertainment, work, and money. Indeed, an
increasing number of fields are being affected by connected objects:
domotics (home automation), the automobile sector, health, energy,
well-being, and are likely to be integrated in all industries and services
over time. The emergence of artificial intelligence and of virtual and
augmented reality should lead to significant developments in
consumer services (Apple’s and Amazon's personal voice assistants,
3D content at 360°) as well as processes in companies.

The big Internet players generate revenue through data monetization
(collected and analyzed thanks to Big Data techniques). In this
context, consumers have strong expectations on the quality and
reliability of the communication networks, but also on the protection
of their personal data and on having a relationship of trust with their
operator.

Digitization (loT, Big Data) allows companies to improve their
performance by knowing their customers better and by improving the
management of their internal processes. Furthermore, in the face of
the increased threats of cyber-attacks, cyber-security needs are
increasing. Businesses therefore need to be assisted in this double
aspect of their transformation process.

Surge in messaging platforms

2016 witnessed a surge in mobile messaging platforms, which are
positioning themselves in the digital ecosystem to capture the bulk of
value with the development of conversational commerce. For
example, WeChat (of the Chinese group, Tencent) which in four years
has gone from a simple messaging application to a range of integrated
services, including payment, has become the benchmark model in
this field. Thanks to a layer of artificial intelligence, WeChat allows the
user to establish relations directly with a brand and to purchase all
types of services without leaving the messaging system. Based on
this model, Facebook is also trying to combine the entire user
experience under a single application. Hence, Facebook opened its
bot store in April 2016, allowing Messenger users to chat with robots
(bots) designed by brands or services. Consumers can thus ask for
information directly, by chatting with the brands, or make purchases
through the addition of a payment function. The telecoms industry
has joined up with Google, under the GSMA Association, to speed
up the availability of Rich Communications Services (RCS), and thus
offer an open messaging service, globally interoperable on all Android
devices, which also allows conversational commerce.

2.2 Regulations

In all countries in which it operates, the Orange group must comply
with various regulatory obligations governing the provision of its
products and services, primarily relating to obtaining and renewing
telecommunication licenses, as well as to oversight by authorities
seeking to maintain effective competition in the electronic
communications markets. Orange also faces regulatory constraints in

2.2.1. European Union

The regulatory environment of the electronic communications sector
within the member states of the European Union in which the Orange
group operates conforms to a requirement of harmonization arising
from the obligation for National Regulatory Authorities to implement
at a national level the regulatory framework defined at the level of the
European Union, even if the regulatory environment is marked by
certain discrepancies.

This common regulatory framework is presented below with a detailed
description for each major country in which the Orange group operates.

2.2.1.1

The general EU legal framework for electronic communications
consists of five main directives deriving from the 2002 Telecom
Package:

Legal and regulatory framework

= Framework Directive 2002/21/EC of March 7, 2002, on a common
regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and

the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector.

All five directives were reviewed in 2009", with changes fully
implemented by EU member states, and were subsequently placed
under the oversight of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic
Communications (BEREC)®).

On September 14, 2016, the Commission presented its draft review
of the European regulatory framework, in the form of a European
Code of Electronic Communications, along with new connectivity
policy objectives for Europe up to 2025, a draft Regulation for WiFi
access in public places and a 5G action plan. Following the legislative
process which the Commission expects to complete before the end
of 2017, this Code must be implemented in each member state and
be applicable by 2019.

some countries as a result of its historically dominant position in the
fixed telecommunications market. For information concerning risks
linked to the regulations of the electronic communications sector, see
Section 2.4.2 Legal risks.

On October 9, 2014, the European Commission approved a new
recommendation (2014/710/EC) identifying four relevant markets for
product and service susceptible to ex ante regulation, compared to
seven in its previous recommendation made in 2007:

= M 1: wholesale call termination on individual public telephone
networks provided at a fixed location;

- M2: wholesale voice call termination on individual mobile networks;
- M3:
— M 8a: wholesale local access provided at a fixed location,

— M 3b: wholesale central access provided at a fixed location for
mass-market products;

= M4: wholesale high-quality access provided at a fixed location.

This regulatory framework has been fleshed out with a number of
additional texts.

Roaming

Regulation No. 531/2012 of June 13, 2012 by the European
Parliament and Council regarding roaming on public mobile
communication networks within the Union (called Roaming Ill) has
been amended by Regulation No. 2015/2120 Telecoms Single Market
(called “TSM") approved on November 25, 2015 which aims in
particular to ban surcharges for international roaming within the
European Union by June 15, 2017 (see Section 2.2.1.2). These texts:

= introduce, for the wholesale market, a regulated right of access to
European roaming services for MVNOs and resellers;

= extend the sliding cap on roaming rates to the data retail market
until April 2016;

= provide, in the context of reasonable usage, alignment of
international roaming retail prices with national prices for intra-
European communications from June 15, 2017 (subject to a
wholesale market revision). A transition period from April 30, 2016
allows a surcharge to be applied to the national prices equal to the
wholesale market caps;

introduces, in the retail market, a structural solution allowing the
domestic service to be dissociated from the international roaming
service;

= expands, for customers using their cell phones outside the EU,
pricing transparency requirements and bill shock prevention
measures for European operators.

Call termination rates

On May 7, 2009, the European Commission adopted a recommendation regulating fixed-line and mobile voice call termination rates in the EU
(2009/396/EC).

The Commission recommends that national authorities should apply the following principles:

= symmetry in each country between the various operators’ fixed voice call termination rates and also between their mobile call termination
rates, with the option of allowing a four-year transitional asymmetry on fixed or mobile call termination rates to benefit a new entrant;

= call termination rates geared towards the avoidable cost of this service for an efficient operator (i.e. about 1euro cent per minute for voice
MTRs and a lower rate for voice FTRs).

Amendment of the Roaming III regulation

The political objective of the Telecoms Single Market Regulation dated
November 25, 2015, which amended the Roaming I regulation, is to
end the surcharges applicable to roaming for intra-European calls; it
takes into account the serious technical difficulties that must be
resolved to ensure that this key measure for Europe does not have
negative consequences on the price of domestic mobile services or
on network investments.

Under this regulation, a transitional period from April 30, 2016 to
June 14, 2017, allows, for all price plans, intra-European roaming calls
to be charged at the domestic price, plus a maximum surcharge
corresponding to the regulated wholesale price caps currently
applicable. The cost of incoming roaming calls is capped at the
weighted average regulated call termination rates in Europe (1.08 euro
cents). A “RL@H + surcharge” model is allowed for all pricing plans.

After this transition period, surcharges applicable to intra-European
roaming calls must be stopped according to technical procedures
defined by:

= animplementing act on reasonable usage rules for intra-European
roaming adopted on December 15, 2016;

= a regulation on wholesale roaming prices that should be adopted
during the first half of 2017.

On February 1, 2017, the European Parliament and the European
Council, under the aegis of the Commission, reached a Compromise
on the wholesale price caps to apply from June 15, 2017: 3.2 euro
cents per minute of voice, 1 euro cent for SMS and a sliding scale of
7.7 euro cents in June 2017 to 2.5 euro cents in January 2022 for a
GB of data. Furthermore, it is expected that operators may provide
offers without roaming. The regulation must formally be approved by
the European Council and voted on by the European Parliament
before becoming effective.

Net neutrality

The European regulation on single market for telecommunications of
November 25, 2015 established the rules applicable since April 30,
2016 throughout Europe to preserve the Open Internet. BEREC
published the guiding principles in August 2016 for a consistent
interpretation of these provisions.

The text authorizes reasonable technical management and some
pricing flexibility for Internet access traffic, the offer by operators of
optimized services at the same time as Internet access, and
strengthened transparency to users.

Framework Review

In September 2016, the European Commission presented its
proposals for a new regulatory framework, merging four directives from
the Telecom Package into one European Electronic Communications
Code (EECC) in the form of a single directive. This Code redirects the
objectives of the framework towards investment, and sets “very high
capacity” connectivity as an explicit objective of the regulation.

The Commission set three connectivity strategic objectives for 2025,
complementary to the objectives already defined for 2020:

= all the main socioeconomic drivers, such as schools, universities,
research centers and transport centers, all the public service
providers such as hospitals and government ministries, and
companies which rely on digital technologies, should have access
to very high-speed broadband connectivity enabling users to
download 1 gigabyte of data per second (upload and download
speeds);

= all European households, rural or urban, should have access to
connectivity offering a download speed of at least 100 Mbits/s,
upgradeable to 1 Gbits/s;

Orange / 2016 Registration Document

= all urban areas as well as motorways and railways should have
continuous 5G coverage. As an intermediate objective, 5G should
be commercially available in at least one major city in each member
state of the EU by 2020.

This new code therefore aims to facilitate the operational and
economic conditions to encourage market players to invest in very
high-speed broadband, in particular through a deregulation of the
FTTH networks open to co-investment, and regulations adapted to
local competitive conditions.

It proposes a minimum mobile license period of 25 years and an
allocation based on projects of the national regulators, but according
to procedures safeguarded by the BEREC validation mechanisms and
those of the Commission.

It seeks identical regulation for all interpersonal communications
services interconnected to the telephone network, regardless of the
provider.

The draft was discussed in the European Parliament and the
European Council, and the Commission expects adoption before the
end of 2017. It must then be transposed into national law in the
member states.

Use of the 700 MHz band

On December 14, 2016, the European Parliament, the European
Council and the European Commission agreed the principle of
liberalizing the 700 MHz band for mobile broadband by June 30, 2020
at the latest. Member states will have to justify their request to delay
for a maximum period of two years. The decision is expected in the
spring of 2017.

Protecting Personal Data

Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council
dated April 27, 2016 on the protection of physical persons regarding
the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data,


--- Page 14 ---

repeals directive 95/46/EC (general regulation on data protection). The
new rules strengthen and harmonize within the EU existing rights on
the protection and the control of personal data; they will apply as of
May 2018.

The 2002/58/EC Privacy and electronic communications directive,
specific to the electronic communications sector will also be updated
to remain consistent with the inter-sector directive. A draft regulation
was published for this purpose in January 2017.

2.2.2 France

2.2.2.1 Legal and regulatory framework
Legal framework

The electronic communications sector is primarily governed by the
French Postal and Electronic Communications Code (CPCE) as well
as legal provisions relating to e-commerce, the information society,
consumer protection and personal data protection.

The French government transposed the European Telecom Package,
as amended in 2009, into national law via the Ministerial Order of
August 24, 2011 and the Decree of March 12, 2012, implementing
regulations.

The audiovisual communication services produced or distributed by
the Orange group come under the specific regulations governing this
sector and are governed by the amended law of September 30, 1986.

Regulatory Authorities

The Postal and Electronic Communications Regulatory Authority
(Arcep) is an independent administrative body created by the law of
July 26, 1996 and acts as the French regulator for these sectors
nationwide. The Arcep's main missions in electronic communications
are to set regulations (general or specific obligations) for operators
within its jurisdiction. It has powers to sanction non-compliant
operators and can rule on disputes between operators over technical
and pricing conditions for network access and interconnection. The

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Regulations

Following the European Court of Justice’s invalidation of Decision
2000/520/EC, known as “Safe Harbour”, the European Commission
and the US authorities published a new framework agreement for
transatlantic data exchange. Thus, on July 12, 2016, the European
Commission issued an adequacy decision aimed at recognizing in the
EU-US Privacy Shield, a level of protection essentially equivalent to
European requirements. This agreement is intended to ensure that
the personal data of European citizens enjoy the same protections as
in Europe when they are processed in the United States.

Arcep also allocates spectrum and numbering resources. Finally, it
determines the size of contributions to fund the universal service
obligation and oversees the mechanisms for delivering this funding.

The French Competition Authority is an independent government
authority responsible for ensuring open market competition and
compliance with public economic policy. It has jurisdiction over all
business segments, including the electronic communications sector.
It has sanction powers for anti-competitive practices, as well as
consultative powers. It is also responsible for overseeing mergers and
acquisitions.

The ANFr (Agence nationale des fréquences — French national agency
for frequencies) is responsible for planning, managing and controlling
the usage of radio frequencies and for coordinating the establishment
of certain radio transmission facilities. The frequency spectrum is
covered by 11 controlling authorities: government ministries, Arcep
and the French Broadcasting Authority (CSA). The Arcep and the CSA
are in turn responsible for allotting to users the frequencies they
control.

The CSA (Conseil Supérieur de |'Audiovisuel) is an independent
administrative body created by the law of January 17, 1989, tasked
with protecting freedom of audiovisual communication by means of
any electronic communications technology as regards radio and
television in accordance with the law of September 30, 1986.

the following total quantities of MHz duplex spectrum: 10 MHz
in 800 MHz, 20 MHz in 1,800 MHz and 20 MHz in 2,600 MHz in
each area.

In the 900 MHz band, the quantity differs according to the area:
12.4 MHz in Guadeloupe-Martinique, 10 MHz in Guyana, 5.6 in the
Northern islands.

In the 2,100 MHz band: 14.8 MHz in Guadeloupe-Martinique and
Guyana, 14.8 MHz in the Northern islands.

Orange has the following total spectrum quantities in Reunion and
Mayotte: 10 MHz in 800 MHz, 20 MHz in 1,800 MHz, 14.8 MHz in
2,100 MHz and 20 MHz in 2,600 MHz.

Only the quantity in the 900 MHz band differs: 12.4 MHz in Reunion
and 10 MHz in Mayotte.

Orange launched 4G in all these territories on December 1, 2016.
Mobile coverage

By decision No. 2016-1015 dated July 28, 2016, the Arcep fined
Orange 27,000 euros for failure to comply with the January 1, 2016
deadline concerning coverage of five municipalities in the 2G “white
areas” program out of the eight to be covered as part of the formal
Arcep notice at the end of July 2015; Orange had responsibility to
cover more than 1,100 municipalities in this program as the leading
operator.

As part of the Macron Act of August 6, 2015, measures have been
taken to improve mobile telephony coverage for all non-covered town
centers by the end of 2016. This involves finalizing the “white area"
2G program and supplementing it with the coverage of additional
town centers, which may be deployed in 3G. Furthermore the existing
3G shared network program (8G RAN sharing) in these same areas
must be finalized by mid-2017, based on an agreement between the
four operators and approved by the Arcep in February 2016. Beyond
the town centers, some areas of economic interest that are not
currently covered may be the subject of a request by the relevant
regional authority for financial aid from the government at a local
bureau, which the government will organize.

By decision No. 2016-1678 dated December 6, 2016, approved by
decree dated January 11, 2017, the Arcep requires the operators to
publish more detailed mobile coverage maps, in order for the first
published open data maps to be effective during the summer of 2017.
Initially, these maps target voice/SMS services, with work continuing
to ultimately produce data services maps.

Beyond the 4G coverage obligations set by the licenses, in June 2016
Orange launched Orange Territoires Connectés to accelerate fixed
and mobile broadband and very high-speed broadband coverage in

rural areas of France. Orange is particularly committed to ensuring
that 5 million additional people benefit from Orange 4G in rural areas
by June 2017, bringing the total Orange 4G coverage to 68% of the
population in these areas by mid-2017 (since 2015, Orange 4G mobile
coverage in rural areas has grown from 30% to 42% of the
population). This program enables Orange to fulfill its obligations in
terms of covering the priority deployment area as specified under the
4G license, three years earlier than expected.

Pursuant to the law for economic growth, activity and equal
opportunities, published on August 7, 2015, which granted new
powers in the field to the Arcep, the latter published, in May 2016, its
guidelines relating to mobile network sharing, which emphasize that
roaming, so long as it is transitory or limited in scope, can have
beneficial effects and can be justified in terms of the regulatory
objectives; and that network sharing can be relevant in the least dense
part of France and acceptable, subject to the negative impacts,
namely on competition, being offset by positive impacts, in particular
an improvement of mobile service coverage and quality. In a press
release dated June 30, 2016, the Arcep indicated that the roaming
contract between Orange and Free and the network sharing contract
between SFR and Bouygues met its guidelines.

2.2.2.3 Regulation of fixed-line telephony,
broadband and very high-speed
broadband Internet

Since July 2008, except for retail offers for fixed-line telephony under
universal service, all of Orange’s regulatory obligations concerning
retail fixed-line telephony (access and communication) on the
consumer and business markets have been lifted. Ex ante
asymmetrical regulation of Orange's fixed services relates to retail
offers under the universal service and wholesale offers that are
regulated to ensure effective competition in the retail markets (call
origination and termination, Wholesale Line Rental, unbundling,
access to civil engineering infrastructure, bitstream, passive access
to final segments of the FTTH network and capacity services).

Orange’s obligations regarding cost accounting
and accounting separation in the fixed-line business

The Arcep’s decision No. 06-1007 of December 7, 2006 sets forth
Orange’s obligations as to cost accounting and accounting separation
in the wholesale and retail businesses. When retail activities make use
of wholesale network services that are subject to accounting
separation, these resources are recognized in regulatory accounts at
the wholesale offers price. These obligations were first implemented
in 2007 in respect of FY2006. They were deemed compliant by the
Arcep and have been renewed every year since then.

Analysis of the relevant markets for broadband and
very high-speed fixed broadband, fixed-line telephony
and fixed-line voice call termination (4th round)

Analysis of the fixed broadband and very high-speed
fixed broadband markets mid-2014 to mid-2017

On June 26, 2014, the Arcep issued three analysis decisions on the
fixed broadband and very high-speed fixed broadband markets for
mid-2014 to mid-2017:

= decision No. 2014-0733 concerning analysis of the relevant
wholesale local access market at a fixed location (market 4);

= decision No. 2014-0734 concerning analysis of the relevant wholesale
central access market for mass-market products (market 5);

= decision No. 2014-0735 concerning analysis of the relevant
Wholesale high-quality access market at a fixed location (market 6).

The scopes for these three decisions were defined to comply with
changes made by the European Commission recommendation of
October 9, 2014 on the relevant markets subject to ex ante regulation,
in order to make a distinction between wholesale “generalist” offers
aimed at the consumer and wholesale offers targeting business needs.
In this enterprise segment, Arcep decision No. 2014-0735 provided
for the lifting of the pricing obligations on Orange (copper and fiber) in
some competitive geographical areas from January 1, 2015.

Arcep launched a new round of analysis of the generalist and
enterprise fixed broadband and very high-speed fixed broadband
markets for which it published an assessment document and outlook
in July 2016, and a public consultation on its draft decisions on the
market analysis in February 2017, with a view to their approval in the
autumn of 2017.

Analysis of relevant fixed-line telephony markets
in 2014-2017

On September 30, 2014, the Arcep issued decision No. 2014-1102
on analysis of the relevant markets for fixed-line telephony in 2014-
2017. It prolonged the obligation imposed on Orange to provide
Wholesale Line Rental (WLR) at cost-based prices. The decision

introduced a gradual relaxation of the pricing obligations imposed on
Orange for straight carrier selection offers. Lastly, the decision lifted
the asymmetrical regulation imposed on Orange in the call origination
market for calls to value-added service (VAS) numbers, in favor of the
symmetrical framework established by Arcep decision No. 2007-
0213.

Analysis of the wholesale markets for
fixed-line voice call termination in 2014-2017:
cut in call termination prices

On December 9, 2014, Arcep issued decision No. 2014-1485
concerning analysis of the wholesale fixed-line or mobile call
termination markets for 2014-2017. It set the following price ceilings
for fixed-line call termination:

Caps Call termination

Regulation of fiber optic networks

Regulatory framework governing very high-speed
broadband wholesale offers:

= asymmetric regulation of access to civil engineering infrastructure
which allows alternative operators to deploy their horizontal
networks on Orange's infrastructure: non-discriminatory access at
arate that reflects costs;

= principle that the terminating segments of FTTH networks are
mutualized between operators;

= symmetrical regulation of access to the terminating segment of
FTTH networks: same obligations to offer passive access to the
terminating segment of FTTH networks on reasonable and non-
discriminatory terms apply to all operators cabling buildings
anywhere in France. This access must be made available from a
sharing point in a reasonable location (Arcep decision No. 2009-

1106 of December 22, 2009, completed by decisions No. 2010-
1312 of December 14, 2010 and No. 2015-0776 of July 2, 2015).
Charges must be reasonable and compatible with the principles of
efficiency, relevance, objectivity and non-discrimination.

National Digital Agency

On February 4, 2015, a decree was published in the French Official
Journal on the creation of a national service: the National Digital
Agency, which takes over three responsibilities: steering and
implementation of the “France Very High-Speed Broadband
Program”, coordinating and leading the various initiatives of “French
Tech”, and overseeing the dissemination of digital tools and the
development of their use. It has to coordinate with several other
institutions, including the Caisse des dépéts, BPI France, the National
Digital Council, the Arcep and other state services involved in digital
development.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Regulations

The France Very High-Speed Broadband Program aims to have 100%
of the French population eligible for very high speed broadband by
2022, with an interim target of covering half the population and
companies by 2017. FTTH is seen as the main way of achieving this,
although other technologies are also expected to contribute (transitory
upgrades of the copper network, satellite, LTE). The European
Commission assessed the France Very High-Speed Broadband
Program and decided in November 2016 to raise no objections. This
plan, estimated at a total of 20 billion euros of private and public
investment to meet the 2022 target, is therefore compliant with EU
State aid rules. It breaks down into three parts: an investment of
€6 billion to €7 billion by private operators who expect to use their
own capital to deliver FTTH to 57% of French homes by 2022.
Between € 13 billion and €14 billion to cover the remaining 43% of
French homes, will be financed through networks managed by local
public authorities (RIP):

= half of these homes were deemed sufficiently profitable for the
coverage to be financed through a co-investment between the local
the authorities and the operators;

= the other half involves the coverage of the most rural areas, the cost
of which will be equally split between the French State and the local
authorities.

On January 31, 2017, the Court of Auditors published a first
assessment of the deployment of very high-speed fixed broadband
networks in France. It revised upwards the investment necessary to
reach these objectives, notably by supplementing its scope, and
foresees very high-speed broadband coverage of the entire French
population by 2030. It advocates broader implementation of transitory
upgrades of the copper network, enabling significant improvements.

Deployment of fiber optic networks

As part of the debate on the transition from copper to fiber optic and to
extend the 2015 “Champsaur report” aimed at specifying the conditions
and the timing for the extinction of copper, the Arcep launched a
consultation in June 2016 to define the concept of “fibrous areas” and
the appropriateness of a relaxation of the pricing obligation applicable
to Orange's copper local loop (unbundling price) in such areas.

Ordinance No. 2016-526 of April 28, 2016 implements in French law
directive 2014/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council
of May 15, 2014 relating to measures aimed at reducing the
deployment cost of broadband electronic communication networks. It
introduces a right for the operators to access existing civil engineering
infrastructure - electronic communications, transport, energy and
water — to deploy their very high-speed broadband networks.

Enterprise market

The Arcep launched two public consultations in June 2016 regarding
the Enterprise market:

= adraft guidelines document on the fixed electronic communications
services markets for enterprise customers;

= and a draft recommendation on access to very high-speed fiber
optic networks with an improved quality of service or on the use of
supernumerary fibers, in which the Arcep favors the emergence of
passive wholesale offers enabling the usages covered by the
shared optical local loop to be expanded and, in particular, to meet
the specific needs of enterprises.

Orange / 2016 Registration Document

4th round of analysis of the broadband
and very high-speed broadband markets

In July 2016, the Arcep undertook the triennial review of the
broadband and very high-speed broadband markets, by submitting
for public consultation a document in which it presented an
assessment of broadband and very high-speed broadband regulation
in France in the generalist and enterprise markets, and proposed
some options for change for 2017-2020.

It also submitted for consultation, in February 2017, its draft decisions
on the analyzes of the broadband and very high-speed fixed
broadband market:

= market 3a: market for wholesale local access provided at a fixed
location: unbundling on the copper local loop, access to civil
engineering infrastructure, passive access to the FTTH local loop
or bitstream with delivery to the optical connection node, passive
FTTH offer with quality of service;

= market 3b: market for wholesale central access provided at a fixed
location for mass-market products; regional copper bitstream or
FTTH;

= market 4: market for wholesale high-quality access provided at a
fixed location: partial termination access LPT, SDSL bitstream,
FTTO, FTTE, FTTH wholesale offers.

These draft decisions led to the conclusion that it would be advisable
to extend the majority of the obligations currently imposed on Orange,
which would remain the only dominant player in the different markets.


--- Page 20 ---

They foresee the possibility of imposing new obligations on Orange in
the generalist FTTH market, and confirm that the regulation of enhanced
quality of service offers (Enterprise access market) must change.

In February 2017, the Arcep also published a draft decision related to
updating Orange's offer to access civil engineering infrastructure from
2018.

Universal telephony service

On June 27, 2016, the DGE (Directorate General for Enterprise)
published two draft calls for applications (connection and service)
submitted to public consultation until August 31, 2016, in relation to

Legal and regulatory system

The 2009 Telecom Package was implemented into Spanish law by
Royal Decree No. 726/2011 on universal service provision in May
2011 and Royal Decree No. 13/2012 of March 31, 2012.

The telecommunications sector is also covered by law No. 15/2007
of July 3, 2007 relating to the implementation of competition rules.

Law No. 34/2002 of July 11, 2002 relating to the information society
and electronic commerce specifies the obligations and limits of
responsibility applicable to service providers in the information society.

The regulatory framework applicable to data protection in Spain is
based around law No. 15/1999 of December 13, 1999, relating to
personal data protection and order No. 999/1999 relating to security
measures. In the field of intellectual property rights protection, law No.

telephony user system until 2019. The call for applications for the
“connection” component was published in the French Official Journal
on January 11, 2017. Orange was a candidate.

Net Neutrality

Following the adoption of the European open Internet regulation on
November 25, 2015 and the publication of BEREC’s guidelines on
August 30, 2016, law No. 2016-1321 for a Digital Republic, enacted
on October 7, 2016, enshrines the principle of net neutrality in the
national legal framework and grants the Arcep an investigative and
sanctioning power to ensure compliance.

information society.

Regulatory Authorities

= The regulatory authorities for the different sectors of the economy,
including telecommunications and the regulator for competition
issues, have been brought together under a new cross-industry
entity, the National Commission for Markets and Competition
(Comisién Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia, CNMC),
set up by law No. 3/2013 of June 4, 2013.

= Since November 4, 2016, a new ministry of energy, tourism and
the Digital Agenda (MINETAD) was created, taking over the
responsibilities of the former industry ministry. MINETAD is
responsible for managing authorizations, spectrum allocations,
telephone numbering, universal service cost approvals, quality of
service, and disputes between consumers and non-dominant
operators.

Concluding its 3rd round of market analysis of the wholesale mobile call termination market (market 7/2007), the CMT issued a decision
ES/2012/1291 on May 10, 2012 proposing a gradual decrease of mobile call termination caps, reaching rate symmetry in July 2013. The

adopted caps are as follows:

04/16/2012- 10/16/2012- 03/01/2013 - From

Spectrum license for the 900 MHz band was extended from 2025 to 2030 and

In May 2011, the Spanish authorities allocated a 5 MHz duplex block
in the 900 MHz spectrum to Orange Spain. The license, granted under
the principle of technological neutrality, is valid until December 2030.

In July 2011, the Spanish authorities auctioned the 800 MHz, 900
MHz and 2.6 GHz frequency bands. In July 2013, Orange Spain's

its 1,800 MHz license from 2023 to 2030.

In March 2016, through regional auctions, Orange obtained a bloc of
2x10 MHz in the 2.6 GHz band and a bloc of 20 Miz in the 3.5 GHz
band.

Spectrum cap per operator Rates in 2017

The cumulative spectrum cap set by the CNMC since 2011 at 185
MHz per operator, with a limit of 135 MHz in the high spectrum bands
(1,800 MHz, 2,100 MHz, 2.6 GHz and 3.5 GHz) and 50 MHz in the
lower bands (<1 GHz) was modified on January 14, 2016 by the
INF/DTSA/026/15 decision. The CNMC thus set a new cap of 210
MHz in the highest bands, with the obligation for the holder of the
spectrum to offer wholesale access under “reasonable conditions”.

Spectrum allocation

Following the auctions closed on March 21, 2016, Orange Spain
acquired all the regional spectrum proposed in the 2.6 GHz band (with
the exception of Madrid and Melilla bought by Telefonica), for
28 million euros. This spectrum enables Orange Spain to ensure 4G
coverage over a large part of Spain. Orange Spain has also acquired
spectrum (national license) in the 3.5 GHz band (valid until 2030) for
5G for 20 million euros.

Initialization of the 4th round of market analysis

Since April 2014, the GigADSL and ADSL IP offers, replaced by
NEBA, ceased to be regulated in areas of Spain where NEBA is
available.

Continuing the decommissioning of the copper network

The CNMC approved Telefénica’s first requests to decommission two
distribution frames in its copper network in October 2014. Under the
terms of the regulator's decision on the analysis of the wholesale
network infrastructure, market 4/2007, issued in 2009 and
supplemented by the CNMC's decision of October 2014, Telefonica
is obliged to continue offering the option of unbundling for five years
after filing a request to decommission an exchange with the CNMC.
This period falls to just one year if there are no unbundled operators
in the distribution frame concerned. Up to now, Telefonica has
announced the withdrawal of 89 distribution frames, including 15
distribution frames hosting operators using the unbundling offer and
74 distribution frames hosting operators using the bitstream offer. At
the end of 2016, 17 distribution frames supplying bitstream services
had already been closed.

Package concerning electronic communications into Polish law, and
by the law of February 16, 2007 concerning competition and
consumer protection. The law of December 2012, transposing EU
directives issued in 2009, came into force on January 21, 2013.

The law of May 7, 2010, on developing telecommunication networks
and services, provides access to telecommunications and other
technical infrastructures funded by public funds.

As regards e-commerce, the law of July 18, 2002 that governs
provision of electronic services transposes European Directive
2000/31/EC concerning electronic commerce into national law and
defines electronic service supplier obligations.

Revision of the NEBA reference offer

On January 18, 2017, the CNMC approved the new fiber optic
wholesale offer (OFE/DTSA/005/16) - NEBA - which contains
technical access conditions to Teleféonica’s fiber optic network except
in 66 Spanish municipalities deemed competitive. Furthermore, the
CNMC approved a significant reduction in wholesale transfer prices
from 7.98 to 4.79 euros (5.14 euros from 2018) per Mbit/s per month.

Proposal related to the NEBA LOCAL (VULA)
reference offer

On December 16, 2016, the European Commission accepted the
principle of Telefonica’s new “local NEBA” reference offer. It is a
substitute to physical fiber access outside the 66 municipalities
deemed competitive. Local NEBA will initially be offered with a profile
containing the highest bandwidth (800 Mb/s), under technical
conditions defined in the reference offer. The “local NEBA" prices will
be established later, following approval of the economic replicability
test methodology (notification expected in June 2017).

Third round of market analysis of fixed-line telephony
call origination (market 2/2007).

On December 16, 2016, the EC approved the CNMC decision related
to the third round of market analysis of fixed-line telephony call
origination. This maintains the ex ante obligations already imposed on
Telefonica in terms of non-discrimination, accounting separation and
transparency, as well as the obligation to provide a wholesale
subscription offer at cost-based prices (the offer of a pure carrier
selection is eliminated) and access to call origination through an IP
interconnection. It removes the prohibition on customer win-back
practices and the obligation to provide a double transit call origination
offer, as the retail market is considered to be sufficiently competitive.

The applicable framework concerning personal data protection is
defined by the law of August 29, 1997 concerning personal data
protection, as amended in 2002. The 2004 Telecommunications Act
also defines certain rules applicable to personal data protection and
storage.

Regulatory Authorities

The Ministry of Digitization, created in November 2015, is responsible
for telecommunications.

The Office of Electronic Communications (UKE) is responsible, in
particular, for telecommunications regulation and frequency
management, as well as certain functions related to broadcasting
services.

The Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK) is
responsible for the application of competition law, merger control and
consumer protection.

Digital Poland

The government's action plan to meet the targets of its digital strategy
in Poland was passed in January 2014. The plan is budgeted at
2.7 billion euros and aims to ensure that all households have at least
30 Mbps Internet access by 2020. Nearly half of the funds are
allocated to broadband network construction projects, and the rest
to the development of digital services, particularly in government
ministries. The Polish government will contribute 409.4 million euros.

Mobile call termination rates

The UKE published seven decisions on December 14, 2012, ruling
that Orange Polska, T-Mobile, Polkomtel, P4, CenterNet, Mobyland
and Aero2 each had a dominant position in the mobile call termination
market for the mobile numbers open to interconnection on their
network (market analysis — 3rd round). It also set symmetrical mobile
voice call termination rates for all operators from January 1, 2013, and
termination rates based on pure long run incremental costs as from
July 1, 2013.

In 2016, Polkomtel acquired 100% of the Midas Group, an aggregator
of the Aero2, Mobyland, and Centernet operators and holding a
controlling stake in Sferia. Polkomtel is itself held by the satellite pay
TV company Cyfrowy Polsat. Consequently, Polkomtel controls
directly or indirectly nearly a third of the mobile spectrum below 1 GHz
and nearly 2/5 of the entire spectrum.

Following the political agreement between the Council and the
European Parliament reached in the presence of the Commission on
December 14, 2016, the 700 MHz spectrum band should be
dedicated to mobile networks in all member states from 2020. The
UKE undertook a coordination exercise with neighboring countries
and has already signed an agreement with Ukraine and Sweden.

Allocation of 800 MHz and 2.6 GHz spectrum

At the end of an auction process in October 2015, five blocks of 5
MHz duplex in the 800 MHz band and 14 blocks of 5 MHz duplex in
the 2.6 GHz band were allocated for a period of 15 years. The new
entrant NetNet withdrew after being allocated a 5 MHz duplex bloc in
the 800 MHz band, which was re-allocated to T-Mobile Polska and
the licenses were allocated by the UKE decisions of January 26, 2016.
Orange was allocated 10 MHz duplex in the 800 MHz band and 15
MHz duplex in the 2.6 GHz band for a total of PLN 3,168 million.

The licenses in the 800 MHz band include coverage obligations in
“white areas” at the town level, leading to coverage of 62% of the
Polish population in four years.

On September 29, 2016, the European Commission formally notified
the Polish Government that it should comply with Union rules
regarding the auction process, contesting in particular the non-binding
nature of the offers submitted in the auctions and the allocation in

Orange / 2016 Registration Document

2015, outside of the auction process, of the 800 MHz band to the
mobile operator SFERIA. The procedure is still ongoing.

Network sharing

In 2016, the Competition Authority UOKiK and the European
Commission continued their impact study in relation to the
infrastructure and spectrum sharing agreements in Poland. On
January 15, 2016, UOKiK announced that it had finalized its
preliminary analysis of the cooperation frameworks between
operators, including the wholesale access offers, joint usage and
spectrum and infrastructure sharing, and it had shared this analysis
with the European Competition Authorities. The analysis of the
competition authorities is still under way.

In December 2016, Orange Polska and T-Mobile Polska announced
their network sharing agreement within “NetWorkS!” had been
extended to LTE, without sharing spectrum.

Renewal of Orange Polska’s license
in the 450 MHz band

Considering UKE conditions set in its decision of 13th of
January 2017, Orange Polska did not apply for the renewal of its 5
MHz bloc in CDMA technology license.

Deregulation of SMS call termination rates

In the framework of its second round of market analysis of SMS call
termination rates, the UKE showed no evidence of any market power
of the operators or MVNO and consequently notified the European
Commission of its decision to deregulate this market, thus aligning it
with the large majority of European countries. On September 20,
2016, the European Commission approved the UKE’s analysis
according to which the SMS market was completely competitive and
should be deregulated. The final decision on deregulation was
published on January 31, 2017.

2.2.4.3 Regulation of fixed-line telephony,
broadband and very high-speed
broadband Internet

All of Orange Polska’s regulatory obligations concerning retail fixed-
line telephony (access and communication) in the consumer and
business markets have been lifted. Thus, ex ante regulation of Orange
Polska's fixed services, for the areas defined as non-competitive,
relates to wholesale offers that are regulated to ensure effective
competition in the retail markets (call origination and termination,
Wholesale Line Rental, unbundling, bitstream).

Orange Polska’s obligations regarding cost accounting
and accounting separation in the fixed-line business

The UKE decision No. DHRT-WORK-6090-1/14 (66) of April 10, 2015
describes the obligations imposed on Orange Polska regarding cost-
accounting and accounting separation in wholesale and retail
business. When retail activities make use of wholesale network
services that are subject to accounting separation, these resources
are recognized in regulatory accounts at the wholesale offers price.

Analysis of the wholesale broadband access market
(market 5/2007)

On October 7, 2014, the UKE adopted its decision on the market for
wholesale broadband access (market analysis — 3rd round). The
decision excludes 76 Polish municipalities, covering 24% of the
population, from ex ante regulation and removes all of Orange Polska’s
regulatory obligations in respect of this market in these municipalities.
In these deregulated areas, Orange Poland offers its wholesale
services on a commercial basis. Everywhere else, Orange Poland's
obligations are maintained (on access, non-discrimination,
transparency, accounting separation and cost-based pricing).

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Regulations

Analysis of the wholesale broadband access
market (market 4/2007)

In its June 2, 2014 decisions on market 4, as part of the second round
of market analysis, regarding copper and fiber, the UKE retained
Orange Polska’s obligations (on access, non discrimination,
transparency, accounting separation and cost-based pricing).

The 3rd round of analysis of market 3a/2014 is ongoing (see
significant events).

Reference offer for fixed-line markets

This reference offer applies to all wholesale fixed services: call
origination and termination, Wholesale Line Rental, partial and full
unbundling and bitstream access.

On July 3, 2014 the UKE authorized a new version of the integrated
reference offer, where the monthly price of full unbundling is left
at 22 zlotys.

Fixed-line call termination rates

Since the UKE's decision of September 22, 2009, following its second
round of market analysis, call termination rates must be based on
cost, with no further details given. The UKE reserves the right,
however, to control rates by benchmarking or a retail minus formula
and has indicated it intends to move towards symmetry in 2014. The
UKE thus systematically imposes a fixed-line call termination rate of
0.0273 zlotys on alternative operators, corresponding to Orange
Polska’s call termination rate at local level.

For an efficient generic operator on a New Generation Network (NGN),
the European Commission recommendation of May 7, 2009 requires
National Regulatory Authorities to set the fixed-line call termination
rates based on pure long-run incremental costs. The UKE is preparing
a draft decision applying this recommendation.

Universal service
Expiry of Orange Polska’s universal service obligation

In 2006, the UKE imposed universal service obligations on Orange
Polska until May 9, 2011. Since then, the UKE has taken no further
steps to appoint a new universal service provider. On May 5, 2014,
the UKE published a report that removed universal service obligations
in Poland.

Compensation

For the whole period when it was responsible for universal service
(November 2006 to May 2011), Orange Polska estimated its cost
amounted to 1.1 billion zlotys while only 137 million zlotys were
allotted in compensation by the UKE. Orange Polska has therefore
appealed to have the UKE decisions reexamined.

In March 2014, the UKE designated which operators would bear the
cost of providing a universal service in 2006. Other decisions should
follow for the years 2007-2011.

In the context of the implementation of the directive on measures to
reduce the cost of deploying broadband electronic communications
networks, the government issued a draft law on January 18, 2016,
including an accelerated procedure for the installation of mobile base
stations and access to alternative infrastructures. This law came into
force on June 9, 2016.

Cable wholesale broadband markets

The regulatory framework for access to the cable operators’ networks
is governed by two decisions of the conference of electronic
communications sector regulators (CRC) of July 1, 2011 and
December 11, 2013. Under this framework, cable operators have to
provide wholesale access offers to their network priced on a retail
minus model. On February 19, 2016, the CRC published the decision
revising cable network access prices downwards, and separating the
rates of the wholesale offers applicable i) during and ii) after the launch
phase of commercial offers by the alternative operator.

broadband market to be effectively competitive and that, as a
consequence, no obligation should be imposed on the two wholesale
markets. The EC accepted the Romanian regulator's proposals
without comment. The final decision was published in the Romanian
Official Journal of December 29, 2015. RomTelecom’s obligations as
part of the wholesale market for infrastructure access have been lifted
one year after the publication of the decision.

maintaining unbundling in the copper loop, and by limiting the

regulatory obligations of NGA offers to the economic replicability
test and to a technical equivalence of inputs;

= in market 3b, by imposing a replicability test of 2P offers and
multicast IPTV wholesale access offers, instead of regulated prices.

The regulator's decision on market 4 was adopted on November 7,
2016: it removes the sectoral regulatory obligations on market 4, due
to its competitive characteristics.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
The Orange Group strategy

2.3 The Orange Group strategy

Launched in 2015, the new strategic plan, Essentials2020, focuses
on Orange's ambition for 2020 to provide its customers with an
incomparable service experience by being ever-present to connect
every individual to what is essential to them. This involves providing
exemplary basic services, quality and reliable access, customer
connections at any time and from anywhere, as well as even more
personalized options for services and offers.

Orange serves every kind of customer: those who focus above all else
on price and those who have a particularly high-level of service
expectation, whether private individuals, very small companies or
multinationals. The Group can rely on a series of key strengths for the
mission that it has set out. With its brand and its 155,000 employees,
the Group is present in Europe, Africa and the Middle-East on the
residential market, and everywhere in the world on the Enterprise
market. Orange's ambition breaks down into five main drivers:

offering richer connectivity;

reinventing the customer relationship;

building a people-oriented and digital employer model;
accompanying the transformation of business customers;
diversifying by capitalizing on its assets.

A PON>

Moreover, the strategic plan will be achieved within the framework of
a company that is efficient, responsible and digitally proficient.

1. Offering enriched connectivity

The multiplication of screens, the generalization of video on the
Internet and customers’ growing need for online services and content
has led to an explosion in usage and in mobile data traffic. Moreover,
the digital revolution has created new customer expectations and has
changed their behavior, making connectivity even more important.
Offering an efficient network to all customers is no longer enough;
services must now be tailored to each individual consumer and to
each moment.

Orange would like to offer richer connectivity to all its customers,
whether retail or business. In order to realize this ambition, the Group
will make a series of targeted investments in its networks between
2015 and 2018, of approximately 17 billion euros. Clear priority is
given to investments in very high-speed broadband, in order to
respond to the explosion in traffic and meet customer expectations.
These will allow Orange to develop broadband services, whether fixed
or mobile, as well as convergence packages in Europe. Due to this
priority, investments should remain at a sustained level beyond 2018.

The investments will be made in particular in the following fields:

Development of very high-speed fixed
broadband and of convergence

Very high-speed fixed broadband will be developed in Europe through
an ambitious fiber optics (FTTH) deployment project. Orange is
working pragmatically and appropriately according to the particular
resources and situations in each country: acquisition (Spain), rollout
of a fiber optic network (France, Poland), use of cable when already
present (Belgium), partnership (Romania). Orange's objective in France
is to catch up and quickly surpass the geographic reach of cable, in
order to be able to offer very high-speed broadband services to the
greatest number of people. FFTH is a source of value creation for the
Group, through the recovery of market share, customer loyalty and
the improvement of the average revenue per user (ARPU). This
approach also allows Orange to better serve business customers
throughout Europe. The number of fiber consumers of the Orange
group was 3.3 million at the end of 2016; within a year, it had doubled
in Spain, increased five-fold in Poland and by 1.5 times in France. The
number of connectible homes reached 6.9 million in France at the end
of 2016 and 9.6 million in Spain, a country where the Group has
become the second fixed broadband operator and is targeting
14 million connectable homes by the end of 2019. This extension will
also help strengthen the fixed-mobile convergence strategy in Spain,
where it represented 84% of the very high-speed fixed broadband
customer base at the end of 2016. In Poland, Orange Polska
continued the deployment of its FTTH network with over 1.5 million
households connectable at the end of 2016, with the objective of
connecting 3.4 million homes by 2018. In Belgium, Orange launched
its first convergent and very high-speed broadband cable television
offers in 2016. At the end of 2016, Orange had thus established itself
as the leader in convergence in Europe with 9.2 million retail
convergent subscribers.

Development of very high-speed mobile
broadband tying

The Group aims to develop very high-speed mobile broadband in all
of the geographic areas where it operates. In Europe, the number of
4G customers of Orange reached 28 million at the end of 2016, or a
growth of 58% over one year (this growth is based on the extension
of broadband coverage, with the goal of covering more than 95% of
Europe with 4G by 2018, both when traveling and within buildings,
by relying on the quality of the spectrum portfolio). In Africa and in the
Middle-East, Orange‘s total mobile customer base reached
121 million customers at the end of 2016. The Group continues to
invest significantly in territorial coverage, with a particular emphasis
on the continued deployment of broadband networks: today, 10
countries of the region have access to the 4G network. In 2016,
Orange also obtained new 4G spectrum in Senegal, Tunisia and
Egypt.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
The Orange Group strategy

Continuation of network modernization

In anticipation of the future needs of its customers, the Group is
upgrading its networks to make them more agile and automatically
adaptable. Orange is thus continuing to drive the transition of its
networks towards all-IP, the Cloud and the virtualization of networking
functions, with the goal of being able to make them programmable in
real time and dynamically, based on the evolution of traffic and needs.
The Group is also preparing for the introduction of 5G, adapted to the
new uses of mobile Internet and the Internet of Things. These changes
will also allow the Group to reduce the cost structure of its networks,
as well as their CO, emissions. For more information, see Section
3.2.1 Network.

An enriched content experience

The quality of the Group's networks, particularly in very high-speed
broadband, allows it to support the development of uses and respond
to customer demands by offering a multi-screen experience. The
development of uses is also based on access to quality content. In
this area, the Group's content strategy consists in strengthening its
role as a distributor by focusing on content aggregation: choosing,
highlighting, packaging and offering attractive content meeting
customer expectations in a simple and fluid manner. For example,
OCS is now directly distributed via the Internet as Over-The-Top
content (OTT) and Orange has launched a new fiber range which
includes the best family TV channels, offered by CANAL+. For more
information, see Section 3.1.9.2 Shared Services — Content.

Orange‘s new Livebox, previewed on March 16, 2016 at the Hello
Show and officially launched on May 19 in France, meets the expectations.
expressed by customers and their changing uses, by the strong
connectivity offered on all their screens and in all rooms in the house.

As part of the Essentials2020 plan, Orange's objective is to achieve a
three-fold increase (in comparison with 2014) in the average data
speeds of its customers on its fixed and mobile networks by 2018.

2. Reinventing the customer
relationship

The relationship with the customer is a key success factor, thanks to
the direct link with the end-customer, especially when facing
competition from OTT platforms. The Group aims therefore to have
an impeccable relationship with its customers, thanks in particular to:

= the power of the Orange brand;

= the simplification of customer journey by limiting the number of
steps and intermediaries;

= the improvement of the customer experience.

Brand identity

Orange has a strong brand and decided, as part of the Essentials2020
strategic plan, to transform its visual identity to better reflect its desire
to be more attentive to its customers. Three new countries adopted
the Orange brand in 2016: Egypt, Belgium and Morocco. For more
information, see section 3.4.2 The Orange brand.

Unified customer journey

With the rise of the Internet and of smartphones, the mobile phone
has become the entry point for sales and services, leading the Group
to optimize the interconnection of its physical sales areas and
reconsider their role. Customers want more autonomy, speed and
availability at all times via their smartphone which then becomes the
entry point to the customer space Orange et Moi where customers
can manage, from their smartphone, their Internet and mobile contracts,
easily contact Orange and solve a malfunction. At the end of 2016,
this application had almost 13 million active users. It is available in all

Orange / 2016 Registration Document

countries where the Group operates. Furthermore, in April 2016,
Orange announced the acquisition of a stake in Africa Internet Group
which operates a total ten e-commerce platforms in 23 African
countries used by over 50,000 local and international companies.

Physical stores can then concentrate on more sophisticated tasks
such as advising customers on more complex operations. The
previous logic of proximity, valid for physical stores, gives way to a
logic of excellence of service, provided in larger and more welcoming
stores that are organized by theme: home, family, work, well-being,
entertainment. The Smart Stores are thus part of a single digital-
physical journey. At the end of 2016, Orange had 157 Smart Stores,
of which 144 were located in Europe including the Opéra megastore
in Paris.

The improvement of the customer experience

New customer relations management tools allow services to be better
targeted based on customer uses. The purpose of these tools is to
reconstruct the history of a customer's relationship with Orange,
regardless of their contact points, in order to better know the
customer and propose customized solutions that correspond to his
or her needs and expectations.

To meet the need for a simpler customer experience and our
customers‘ needs for autonomy and responsiveness, Orange‘s
objective is to achieve 50% of its customer interactions via the digital
channel in Europe by 2018.

3. Building a company model
that is both digital and caring

Orange wants to be a company to which all its employees, men and
women, are proud to belong. In order to measure employee
satisfaction, and deliver business performance, Orange has
introduced an employee satisfaction plan with a bi-annual survey in
France and annually outside of France.

A recognized policy of developing human
resources

Orange's ambition to build a people-oriented and digital employer
model has already materialized, thanks to the Top Employer
certification it received in 29 countries from the Top Employers
Institute. This certification awards actions implemented in each of
these countries in the areas of professional growth, training and skills
development. In 2016, the Group obtained the world certification Top
Employer Global 2016 for the first time.

Development of collective agility and support
to employees with the digital transformation

The use of digital tools by Orange employees will help develop skills
and cross-fertilization between business activities, encourage
engagement within the Group and contribute to the quality of the work
environment.

In 2016, Orange stated its undertaking to be a “digital and human
employer” as a fundamental element of its Essentials2020 strategic
plan. In 2016, Orange signed the first agreement on the support of
the digital transformation, the aim of which is to support employees
so that each and every one them can be part of this approach and
find their place within it.

Fostering individual commitment

The granting of more than 5% of Orange's capital to employees helps
encourage their commitment and participation in the company’s life.
It is Orange‘s ambition to continue to develop this shareholding. Thus,
in 2016, 11.2 million shares were subscribed by 45,000 employees
as part of the offer reserved for employees, Orange Ambition 2016.


--- Page 30 ---

Orange also launched, in April 2016, an international Cube challenge,
the main objective of which was to allow every Group employee to
better adopt its strategy and participate in a collective, digital, and
unifying initiative, around the Orange culture.

Convinced that a positive customer experience is founded on a quality
employee experience, the Group aims to have 90% of its employees
recommend Orange as an employer by the end of the Essentials2020
strategic plan.

4. Accompanying the transformation
of business customers

The digital transformation opportunities, efficiency and growth, are
profoundly transforming the activities, organization, tools (customer
and employee relations) and the processes of businesses. In this
context, Orange is positioned as a trusted partner to support
companies in their digital transformation. To this end, the Group is
attentive to the needs and specifics of each of its customers’
industries, business lines and processes, and security constraints,
from SMEs to multinationals. The Group will focus on four key areas,
in addition to its traditional role as a supplier of connectivity wherever
it is present:

= providing digital work solutions to allow employees to become more
mobile, more connected and more collaborative. Orange thus
intends to become a leader in the integration of mobile solutions
into work stations;

improving business line processes, particularly through applications
and connected objects, which provide companies with new
possibilities;

supplying multinationals with private and hybrid Cloud solutions, an
area in which Orange wants to be the leader in France. Cloud
services are an essential tool to bring agility and flexibility to companies
(virtualization, systems integration, business applications, API,
building blocks for connected objects, Big Data and analytics);

security solutions for the protection of all areas of companies’ vital
activities, an increasingly important challenge today: infrastructures,
a company’s strategic data and interactions with its customers
(website, order taking and customer management tools).

2016 saw an expansion in cyber security activities (marked by a 17%
growth in revenues in 2016) with the acquisition of Lexsi, as well as
Cloud services (+17% growth in revenues in 2016) with the acquisition
of Log’in consultants (activity dedicated to integration services in
relation to the virtualization of the workstation of the Log’in
International group). Furthermore, 2016 was marked by the
international launch of the Easy Go Network, a service offering
multinationals looking for more intelligent and more flexible networks
solutions for the virtualization of network functions. For more
information, see Section 3.1.8 Enterprise.

As part of its Essentials2020 plan, Orange's objective is to increase
the share of IT services in the Orange Business Services revenue mix
by 10 percentage points by 2020.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
The Orange Group strategy

5. Diversifying by capitalizing
on its assets

Orange focuses on two areas where it can capitalize on its assets and
gain legitimacy in its customers’ eyes in order to develop new sources.
of growth: connected objects and mobile financial services.

Connected objects and mobile financial services have fundamentally
transformed customers’ daily life, and Orange believes it can provide
a real value-added service to customers in these areas. These
services require enhanced connectivity and offer numerous synergies
with the Group‘s main assets: customer relationships, digital
expertise, both physical and digital distribution power, capacity for
innovation, brand strength (building confidence and trust with clients),
networks and international presence. The Group has set the goal
to surpass one billion euros in revenues in these new growth drivers
by 2018.

Connected objects

The Group wants to be present across the entire value chain of
connected objects:

= the distribution of connected objects;

= the supply of value-added services around those objects, particularly
in the health and wellness field or in the connected home field;

= the management of data from these connected objects, in
particular using Datavenue, its open intermediation platform.

2016 was marked by two Group initiatives in this area:

= the launch of Datavenue at the international level, in order to
complete the Group's position in the loT value chain and add value
to the data collected via connected objects;

the continued gradual deployment of the ultra-narrowband network
in the Internet of connected objects, using the LoRa (Long Range)
technology, already available in 18 urban areas in France. The
Group also joined the Board of LoRa Alliance®, which today has
over 300 member companies, to contribute to the global success
of the LoRaWAN™ protocol.

Mobile financial services

The growth prospects for mobile financial services are significant, not
only in Europe but also in Africa, where the mobile penetration rate is
much higher than the percentage of people with bank accounts in
most concerned countries, and where customers want to make an
increasing number of payments on the go, in a simple and fluid
manner using smartphones.

In 2016, Orange continued its development in several areas:

= in financial services with the development of Orange Money in
Africa, leader of the digital financial service which, in 2016,
witnessed a growth in revenues of 58.5% compared with the
previous year. In Africa and in the Middle-East, Orange already has
close to 29 million users of money transfer and payment services with
a volume of transactions of more than one billion euros per month;

= in contactless mobile payment using NFC technology in Europe
and the contactless payment application Orange Cash, launched
in Spain and rolled out widely in France, including on iPhone;

in the mobile banking, which offers significant growth prospects,
and where the Group concentrated its efforts. In 2016, Orange
acquired a 65% interest in Groupama Banque, a subsidiary of
Groupama that was then renamed Orange Bank. The subsidiary

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
The Orange Group strategy

common to these two groups will launch in France at the beginning
of 2017 a 100% mobile banking offer which will be marketed under
the double brand Orange and Groupama in their respective physical
distribution networks, and directly on smartphones.

Through Orange Bank, Orange and Groupama will offer most banking
services such as current account management, payment, savings,
credit and insurance. The goal of these two operators is to eventually
attract over 2 million customers in France.

A digital, efficient
and responsible company

The Group wants to meet its objectives in respect of CSR performance
by being an ethical company, respectful of the ecosystem and the
environment in which it operates.

Open innovation

To develop its new services, Orange continues to focus on innovation,
by complementing its own resources through an Open innovation
approach. Orange supports 236 start-ups worldwide through its
Open innovation programs and its objective is to increase this figure
to 500 by 2020. For more information, see Sections 3.3.2 Open
innovation and 3.3.3 Capital investment.

Corporate responsibility

In order to respond to the social and environmental challenges related
to the ever-greater number of devices (smartphones, tablets,
connected objects), as well as to the multiplication of energy-
consuming uses by consumers, Orange has committed to two
priorities: a 50% reduction in its CO, emissions per customer use by
2020 (compared to 2006), and to promote the integration of the
circular economy within its organization and its processes. In
2016, CO, emissions per customer use had been reduced by 48%
since 2006.

For the 2016 Shareholders’ Meeting, Orange published for the first
time an Integrated Annual Report inviting shareholders as well as the
public to read the societal aspects of its strategy. Its objective is to
show how Orange, a digital, efficient and responsible company,
ensures that its corporate project is a long term one in order to
position itself at the service of its customers and create value for
society as a whole while using digital technology to achieve faster
progress for all.

Operational effectiveness

Orange continues to improve its operational effectiveness through the
implementation of its Explore2020 program. Since 2015, Orange has
achieved gross savings of 1.7 billion euros, in line with its goal of
reaching 3 billion euros of savings between 2015 and 2018.

Orange / 2016 Registration Document

Ambitions

Orange's strategy, in terms of its core activities and new business
areas, aims to generate new growth while maintaining a healthy
financial position. Concerning operations, the Group will track several
major indicators to assess the implementation of the Essentials2020
plan presented in March 2015.

The first two global summary indicators reflect the core ambition of
Essentials2020 concerning Orange customers’ digital experience:

= aleadership indicator in terms of customer recommendations (the
Net Promoter Score or NPS). This global indicator encompasses
all of the strategic plan's drivers. Orange wants to become number
1 in NPS for three out of four customers by 2018;

= an indicator that measures the power of the Orange brand: the
Brand Power Index. Orange is aiming for continuous improvement
in this indicator across its markets from now until 2018, through
the Group‘s improvement of the digital experience of customers
and its new brand identity.

Beyond this, Orange has one ambition per driver:

= for the first driver on richer connectivity, Orange has set an objective
of tripling the average data speeds of its customers on its fixed and
mobile networks by 2018 compared to 2014;

= for the second driver on the customer relationship, Orange is aiming
for 50% digitization of interactions with its customers by 2018;

for the third driver on the people-oriented and digital employer
model, Orange has chosen an indicator identical to that chosen for
its customers, based on recommendation. Orange is aiming for 9
employees out of 10 to recommend Orange as an employer
by 2018;

= for the fourth driver on the Enterprise market, Orange has chosen
to measure the success of the transformation of its Enterprise
business model towards IT services. The Group aims to raise the
share of IT and integration services in the Orange Business Services
revenue mix by 10 points by 2020;

- for the last driver, the selected indicator will measure the success
of diversification into new services, with connected objects and
mobile finance services. The objective is for these new services to
contribute more than one billion euros to the Group's revenues
in 2018.

Financial objectives

As regards the financial component, see section 4.5 Outlook, and 4.6
Dividend distribution policy.

2.4 Risk factors

In addition to the information contained in the present Registration
Document, investors should carefully consider the risks outlined below
before deciding whether to invest. The Company's view at the date
of this Registration Document is that these risks could have a material
negative impact on the business, financial position or profits of Orange
and/or its subsidiaries. In addition, other risks and uncertainties, as
yet unidentified or, as of the date of this Registration Document, not
currently considered to be material by Orange, could have similar
negative impacts. Investors could lose all or part of their investment if
these risks materialize.

The risks described in this chapter concern:

= risks relating to Orange's business activities (see Section 2.4.1);
= risks of a legal nature (see Section 2.4.2);

= financial risks (see Section 2.4.3).

In each section, risk factors are presented in diminishing order of
importance, as determined by the Company at the date of filing the
current Registration Document. Orange may change its view of their
relative importance at any time, particularly if new external or internal
facts come to light.

Several other sections of this Registration Document also discuss
risks in some detail:

- for risks related to Orange's general strategy, see Section 2.3 The
Orange group's strategy;

= for risks relating to regulations and regulatory pressure, see Section
2.2 Regulations and Note 16 Litigation to the consolidated financial
statements (Section 4.1);

2.4.1. Operational risks

Operational risks mainly include risks related to the telecommunications.
sector, risks related to strategy and the economic environment and
risks relating to human resources.

The rapid growth in broadband use (fixed or mobile) and the
emergence of new network access technologies allow global
players in the Internet sector the opportunity to establish a direct
link with telecommunications operators’ customers, thus
depriving the latter, including Orange, of a share of their revenues
and margins. If this phenomenon intensifies, it could seriously
impair the financial position and outlook of the operators.

The increased use of networks for value-added services has led to
the emergence of new powerful players, the Over-The-Top providers
(OTT). Competition with these players to control customer relations is
growing and could erode the operators’ market position. This direct
relationship with customers is a source of value for operators and to
lose part or all of it to new entrants could affect revenues, margins,
the financial position and outlook of telecommunications operators
like Orange.

In response, Orange has adopted a strategy aimed at making
significant investments to increase the capacity of its transport and
aggregation networks and to set itself apart based on the quality of
the very high-speed broadband service offered, and supplying more
innovative and attractive communication services.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Risk factors

= for risks relating to litigation involving the Group, also see Notes 9
Taxes and 16 Litigation to the consolidated financial statements, as
well as Section 4.4 Recent events, where applicable;

for risks relating to the vulnerability of the technical infrastructure
and environmental risks, see Section 5.6.2 Environmental information;

= for financial risks, see:

— Notes 7, 8 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for
asset impairments,

— Note 11.8 to the consolidated financial statements for

assets and liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for
the management of interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk,
covenants, credit risk and counterparty risk, and equity market
risk. The policies for managing interest rate, foreign exchange
and liquidity risks are set by the Treasury and Financing
Committee. See Section 5.2.3.3 Executive Committee and
Group governance committees;

= for the insurance plan, see Section 5.4.7 Insurance;

= more generally, risk management policies throughout the Orange
group are discussed in the Chairman's Report on governance and
internal control. See Section 5.4 Activity and risk management
framework,

There is, however, no guarantee that this strategy, and particularly the
innovative nature of certain investments, will be sufficient to offset the
pressure from new entrants. If the profitability of these investments
could not be secured, the financial position and outlook of Orange
could be affected.

The Group included in its Essentials2020 plan the development
of mobile financial services, concretized in 2016 by obtaining
approvals for electronic money in Africa and by making an equity
investment in Groupama Banque, then in the first half of 2017
through the launch of Orange Bank. These activities are likely to
generate specific new risks or increase the impact of current risks.

The development of activities in the field of mobile financial services
exposes the Group to new risks, inherent to this sector, such as
money laundering, terrorist financing and non-compliance with
economic sanction programs. In addition, the risks of fraud, cyber-
attack, loss, unauthorized disclosure or communication of customer
data and interruption to services (see below) could be particularly
acute in the field of banking services.

Furthermore, entities of the Group having the status of a regulated
financial institution could face a risk of non-compliance with banking
regulations.

Lastly, the strengthened internal control system, required for activities
within the field of financial services, which is currently put in place,
may prove to be insufficient.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Risk factors

These risks are even higher since the Group's regulated financial
institutions should experience an important transformation in the
growth of their offers and activities, and an expansion of their
customer base, in the coming years.

If these risks materialize, they could have a material impact on the
Group's financial position, completion of its strategy and image.

Orange may face risks linked to customer data, notably for their
disclosure to third parties or inappropriate modification. Its
liability may also be triggered or its reputation damaged by its
Internet access and hosting provider activities.

Orange's activities may trigger the loss, disclosure, unauthorized
communication to third parties or inappropriate modification of the
data of its customers or the general public, particularly their banking
details, which are stored on its infrastructure or carried by its
networks.

These losses could arise (i) from the implementation of new services
or new applications, for example those relating to billing and customer
relationship management, (ii) from the development of new activities
in the field of connected objects, (iii) from malicious acts (such as
cyber attacks) particularly aimed at personal data, or (iv) possible
negligence within Orange or the Group's outsourcing partners.

Liability proceedings against Orange are possible in a lot of countries
through legislation that has reinforced operators’ obligations, and is
becoming more stringent.

Moreover, Orange may in some countries be obliged to disclose
personal data to third parties under legislation that would fail to offer
the same protection as France, which could damage the Company's
reputation and brand.

If they materialize, these risks could have a considerable impact on
the Group's reputation and a high impact on its liability, including
criminal liability, and hence have an adverse impact on the Group's
future results.

Much of Orange’s revenues is earned in mature markets where
intense competition among operators to offer attractive prices
and convergent offers could erode its profitability or market share.

The main markets in which Orange operates are mature or even
saturated. In these conditions, Orange faces extremely tough
competition, mainly on prices but also on the capacity to deliver
convergent offers (fixed, mobile and very high-speed broadband),
particularly with the recent emergence of cable operators such as
‘SFR-Numericable in France.

In response, Orange has chosen to make significant investments in
terms of innovation and continues to implement a transformation and
fixed cost reduction policy. It has also decided to adjust its asset
portfolio through acquisitions (such as those completed in 2016 in
four African countries) or disposals. Orange has also committed to
developing new activities such as mobile financial services and
connected objects. Lastly, Orange actively participated in the attempt
in early 2016 to consolidate the market in France.

Faced with this competition, if Orange is unable to successfully
implement its strategy, it could suffer a loss of market share and/or
shrinking margins. This situation could also occur in the event of a
consolidation not involving the Group in a market where it operates.

Orange / 2016 Registration Document

For more information on competition, see Chapter 3 Overview of the
Group's business.

Orange is exposed to the risk of an interruption of its networks
and services following cyber-attacks, sabotage, outages or
human errors affecting critical hardware or software, malfunc-
tioning of network equipment, failure of a key supplier or network
saturation.

Damage or interruptions to the service provided to customers may
occur following cyber attacks (on networks and IT systems), outages.
(hardware or software), human errors or sabotage of critical hardware
or software, failure of a critical supplier, or unsufficient network
capacity to meet the growing usage needs, or during the
implementation of new applications or software.

Among these risks of interruption, telecommunications operators are
especially exposed to malicious actions and cyber attacks because
of the vital nature of telecommunications in the functioning of the
economy. Despite the steps taken by Orange to protect its network,
the growing frequency of such attacks increases the risk of an
interruption to its services.

As a result of the rationalization of the network based on the
implementation of all-IP technologies, the increase in the size of the
service platforms and the relocation of equipment into fewer buildings,
such service interruptions may in the future affect a greater number
of customers and more than one country simultaneously.

Although difficult to quantify, the impact of such events could seriously
damage the Group's reputation, trigger its liability and result in a
reduction of traffic and hence revenues, affecting its profits and
outlook. If they were to occur on a nationwide or multinational scale,
they might also create a crisis potentially affecting the security of the
countries concerned.

The technical infrastructure belonging to telecommunications
operators is vulnerable to damage or interruptions caused by
natural disasters, fires, wars, acts of terrorism, intentional damage,
malicious acts, or other similar events.

A natural disaster or other unforeseen incidents affecting Orange's
installations could cause significant damage generating high repair
costs. In most cases, Orange has no insurance for damage to its lines
and must assume the full cost of the repairs itself. Furthermore, the
damage caused by such major disasters may have more long-term
consequences resulting in significant expense for Orange and which
would harm its image, results and outlook. In addition, weather
phenomena associated with climate change may grow in frequency
and increase the severity of disasters and of the damage caused.

The scope of Orange activities and the interconnection of the
networks mean that the Group is exposed to the risk of
numerous frauds, which could reduce revenues and margins and
damage its image.

As all operators, Orange is subject to various fraud issues which can
affect the Company or its customers. Moreover, with technologies and
networks becoming increasingly complex and the acceleration of
implementation of new services or new applications relating notably
to billing and customer relationship management, new types of fraud
which are more difficult to detect or combat could also develop. In all
these cases, Orange’s revenues, margins, quality of service and
reputation could be affected.


--- Page 34 ---

The Group could have a skills shortage in its activities due to
numerous employee retirements or changing needs in the
coming years.

The high number of employee retirements or early retirements that will
occur by 2020 due to Orange's demography in France, as well as the
need for new skills in the Group's growth areas, could affect Orange’s
ability to renew its skills base, which could affect the Group's ability to
carry out its projects and development strategy. In these
circumstances, Orange's results and outlook could be affected.

In the context of consolidation in the European telecommu-
nications sector, Orange is likely to make significant acquis!
that could lead to integration risks.

After the acquisition of Jazztel in 2015, the Group participated in
negotiations aimed at consolidating the market in France, which did
not come to fruition. Nevertheless, if Orange should make other
significant acquisitions as the sector continues to consolidate, it could
face a risk of integrating newly acquired entities or businesses, which
could have a material impact on its margins and profits.

Orange is relying on sources of growth in the countries where
the Group has invested. Investments already made may fail to
bring the expected returns and may generate unexpected
commitments, and the Group could be faced with increased
country risk, including from corruption. The Group’s results,
outlook and image could be impacted.

The Group's growth partly depends on its activities in geographical
areas undergoing rapid economic development. Orange has thus
invested in telecommunications companies located in the Middle East
and in Africa. Political instability or changes in the economic, legal or
social landscape in these geographical areas may call into question
the outlook on profitability expected when these investments were
made. International economic sanctions imposed on these countries
could also have an impact on the value of these investments.

In addition, these geographical areas can pose difficulties or specific
risks related to internal controls or non-compliance with applicable
laws and regulations, such as anti-corruption rules. Despite the
Group's drive to strengthen its anti-corruption policy, corruption cases
could occur, which could have an adverse impact, particularly on the
Group's image.

Other geographical areas where the Group operates, including central
and eastern European countries, are also exposed to risks of
geopolitical instability and non-compliance with applicable laws and
regulations, which could threaten the outlook on profitability held when
these investments were made.

If the expected growth in revenues from these various geographical
areas is not achieved or if Orange is not able to render them profitable,
the Group's financial position and results could be affected.

Telecommunications operators such as Orange may be affected
by possible adverse health effects from exposure to electro-
magnetic fields from telecommunications equipment.

Following concerns raised in many countries regarding the possible
health risks linked to exposure to electromagnetic fields from

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Risk factors

telecommunications equipment, public authorities have in general
approved binding regulations and health authorities have issued
various usage precautions.

The perception of a risk by the public could lead to a decrease in the
number of customers and in their usage, lower consumption per
customer, an increase in lawsuits, particularly against the presence of
mobile antennas, and a hardening of regulations, with, as a
consequence, a reduction in coverage areas, deterioration of service
quality and an increase in network roll-out costs.

Although a consensus exists among health experts and health
authorities including the World Health Organization (WHO) that thus
far found no health risks from exposure to electromagnetic fields
below the limits recommended by the specialist international
commission (ICNIRP) have been established, Orange cannot predict
the conclusions of future scientific research or studies by international
organizations and scientific committees called upon to examine these
issues. If an adverse health effect should one day be scientifically
established, this would have a material impact on Orange's business,
its brand and the income and financial position of the Group.

For further information, see Section 5.6.3.7 Health and safety of
customers.

The Group markets its products and services mainly under the
Orange brand. The strategy of diversification into new
businesses and geographic expansion to new territories is
conducted under a single brand policy which is a major asset of
the Group today.

To this end, Orange has chosen growth drivers which are not
necessarily in its core business, such as digital banking, or even using
its business as a telecommunications operator in emerging countries
where the political-financial context may be volatile. In this context,
the Group pays close attention to preserving the value of the brand
despite the operating risks which could adversely affect the
Company's image, in particular in the mature mobile telephony sector.

If a severe financial crisis were to take place in the future, its
impact on the business could depress consumption and materially
affect Orange’s results.

If a financial or economic crisis struck global markets, the
macroeconomic situation could deteriorate, depressing household
spending and business activity, which could materially affect Orange's
revenues and results.

For further information on the impact of the economic situation on the
Orange group, see also financial risks in Section 2.4.3 below.

Orange faces various internal and external human risk factors
which could have a material impact on the Group’s image,
operations, and results.

Orange’s promise to be a people-oriented and digital employer,
inscribed in the Essentials2020 strategic plan, could be affected by
various human factors related to psycho-social risks, to personal
safety, or to tensions in certain countries or areas. If they materialize,
these risks could slow the roll-out of the Group's strategy and have a
material impact on the Group's image, operations and results.

2.4.2 Legal risks

Orange operates in highly regulated markets, where its flexibility
to manage its business is limited. Orange’s business activities
and results could be materially affected by legislative, regulatory
or government policy changes.

In most countries in which it operates, Orange must comply with
various regulatory obligations governing the provision of its products
and services, primarily relating to obtaining and renewing
telecommunication licenses, as well as to oversight by authorities
seeking to maintain effective competition in the electronic
communications markets. Furthermore, Orange faces regulatory
constraints in some countries as a result of its historically dominant
position in the fixed telecommunications market.

Orange's business activities and operating income may be materially
adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or government policy
changes, and in particular by decisions taken by regulatory or
competition authorities in connection with:

= amendment or renewal on unfavorable conditions, or even
withdrawal, of fixed-line or mobile operator licenses;

conditions governing network access (primarily those in connection
with roaming or infrastructure sharing);

service rates;

the introduction of new taxes or increases to existing taxes for
telecommunications companies;

Such decisions could materially affect the Group's revenues and
results.

For further information on risks related to regulations, see Section 2.2
Regulations.

Orange is continually involved in legal proceedings and disputes
with regulatory authorities, competitors, government agencies
or other parties. The outcome of such proceedings is generally
uncertain and could have a material impact on its results or
financial position.

Orange believes that, on a general basis and in all countries in which
it is present, it complies with all the specific regulations in force, as
well the conditions governing its operator licenses. However, the

Orange / 2016 Registration Document

Company is not able to predict the decisions of oversight and legal
authorities who are regularly asked to rule on such issues. Should
Orange be ordered by the relevant authorities in a country in which it
operates, to pay damages or a fine or suspend certain of its activities,
due to non-compliance with an applicable regulation, the Group's
financial position and results could be adversely affected.

In addition, Orange — particularly in France and Poland — is frequently
involved in legal proceedings with its competitors and with the
regulatory authorities due to its dominant position in certain markets
and the complaints filed against Orange may be very substantial. In
the past, fines of several tens of millions of euros and even several
hundreds of millions of euros were imposed on the Group for
concerted practices or for abuse of a dominant position, such as the
350 million euro fine imposed on December 17, 2015, by the French
Competition Authority for illicitly stifling competition in the “enterprise”
market since the 2000s. Finally, the Group may be the object of
substantial commercial lawsuits with potentially very significant
penalties. The outcome of lawsuits is inherently unpredictable.

In the case of proceedings involving European Competition Authorities,
the maximum fine provided for by law is 10% of the consolidated
revenues of the company at fault (or the group to which it belongs, as
the case may be).

The main proceedings involving Orange are detailed in Notes 9 Taxes
and 16 Litigation to the consolidated financial statements. Developments
in or the results of some or all of the ongoing proceedings could have
a material adverse impact on Orange's results or financial position.

The profitability of certain investments and Orange’s strategy in
certain countries could be affected by disagreements with its
partners in companies that it does not control.

Orange operates some of its businesses through companies that it
does not control. Articles of incorporation or agreements which
govern some of these activities require that some major decisions,
such as the approval of business plans or the timing and amount of
dividends, need approval from the different partners. Should Orange
and its partners disagree regarding these decisions, the profitability
of these investments, their contribution to Orange's results and the
strategy pursued by Orange in the countries in which these
companies are located, could be adversely affected.

2.4.3 Financial risks

Liquidity risk
Orange’s results and outlook could be affected if the terms of
access to capital markets become difficult.

The tightening of prudential rules for the financial sector resulting from
the “Basel Ill" and “Solvency II" regulations which seek to strengthen
the capital held by banks and insurance companies, respectively, will
constrain companies from increasing the share of their financing from
the bond markets. Incidentally, the Quantitative Easing policy of the
European Central Bank (ECB) increased the liquidity of these markets.

Orange finances itself mainly through the bond markets. A cessation
of the unconventional policy of the ECB or an unfavorable development
in the macroeconomic situation could restrict or make significantly
more expensive Orange's access to its usual sources of financing
through an increase in the margins applied to its borrowings.

Any inability to access the financial markets and/or obtain financing
on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on Orange.
The Group could, in particular, be required to allocate a significant
portion of its available cash to service or pay off debt, to the detriment
of investment or compensation for shareholders. In all cases, Orange's
results, cash flows and, more generally, financial position and flexibility
may be adversely affected.

See Note 12.3 Liquidity risk management to the consolidated financial
statements, which sets out, in particular, different financing sources
available to Orange, the maturity of its debt and changes to its credit
rating, as well as Note 12.4 Management of covenants, which
contains information on the limited commitments of the Orange group
in relation to financial ratios and in the event of default or material
adverse change.

Interest rate risk

Orange’s business activities could be affected by interest rate
fluctuations.

In the normal course of its business, Orange obtains most of its
funding from capital markets (particularly the bond market) and a small
part from bank loans.

Since most of its current debt is at a fixed rate, Orange has limited
exposure to increases in market interest rates. Of course the Group.
is still exposed to interest rate increases for future financing.

To limit exposure to interest rate fluctuations, Orange from time to time
makes use of financial instruments (derivatives) but cannot guarantee
that these transactions will completely limit its exposure or that
suitable financial instruments will be available at reasonable prices. In
the event that Orange cannot use financial instruments or if its financial
instrument strategy proves ineffective, cash flows and earnings may
be adversely affected.

In addition, the costs of hedging against interest rate fluctuations
could, generally, increase in line with market liquidity, banks’ positions,
and, more broadly, the macroeconomic situation (or how it is
perceived by investors).

The management of interest rate risk and an analysis of the sensitivity
of the Group's position to changes in interest rates are set out in
Note 12.1 Interest rate risk management to the consolidated financial
statements.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Risk factors

Credit-rating risks

If Orange’s credit rating by the agencies is downgraded or placed
under surveillance, or its outlook is revised by rating agencies,
its borrowing costs could increase and in certain circumstances
the Company’s access to the capital it needs could be limited.

Orange's credit rating is partly based on factors over which it has no
control, namely conditions affecting the telecommunications industry
in general or conditions affecting certain countries or regions in which
it operates, and can be changed at any time by the rating agencies.

The Group's financial rating and its outlook were downgraded in 2012,
2013 and 2014. This rating may be revised again at any time in light
of evolving economic circumstances, or following a downturn in the
Company's results or performance or simply due to a change in rating
agencies’ perceptions of these factors, which would have a material
adverse effect on its results and financial position.

Risk of asset impairment

Orange has booked substantial amounts of goodwill following
its acquisitions. Under accounting standards, impairment losses
have in the past and may again in the future be recorded against
goodwill and other assets in Orange’s accounts, including those
of Orange SA, which could reduce its ability to pay dividends.
Orange’s results and financial position could also be affected by
a downturn in equity markets in the event that it carries out an
equity transaction involving some of its subsidiaries.

At December 31, 2016, the gross value of goodwill recognized by
Orange following completed acquisitions and disposals was
32.7 billion euros, not including the goodwill of associates and joint
ventures.

The value in use of the businesses, which comprise most of the
recoverable amounts and which support the book values of long-term
assets including goodwill (and investment securities in the statutory
financial statements) is sensitive to the valuation methods and the
assumptions used in the models. It is also sensitive to any change in
the business environment that is different to the assumptions used.
Orange recognizes assets as impaired if events or circumstances
occur that involve material adverse changes of a permanent nature
affecting the economic environment or the assumptions and targets
used at the time of the acquisition.

Over the past five years, Orange recognized significant impairment
losses in respect of its interests in Poland, Egypt, Romania and
Belgium, in particular. At December 31, 2016, the cumulative amount
of goodwill impairment was 5.5 billion euros, not including the goodwill
impairment of associates and joint ventures.

New events or adverse circumstances could conduct Orange to
review the present value of its assets and to recognize further
substantial impairment that could have an adverse effect on its results.

In addition, in the case of disposals or listings on a stock exchange,
the value of certain subsidiaries could be affected by changes in the
stock and debt markets.

For further information on goodwill and recoverable amounts
(particularly key assumptions and sensitivity), see Note 7 Goodwill to
the consolidated financial statements and Section 4.3.2.2 From Group
adjusted EBITDA to operating income.

Business environment, strategy and risk factors
Risk factors

Credit risk and/or counterparty risk
on financial transactions

The insolvency or deterioration in the financial position of a bank
or other institution with which Orange has a financial agreement
may have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
financial position.

In the normal course of its business, Orange uses derivatives to
manage exchange rate and interest rate risks, with financial institutions
as counterparties. cash collateral is lodged with all bank counterparties
with which the derivatives are contracted. Nevertheless, a residual
credit risk may remain if one or more of these counterparties default
on their commitments.

Moreover, Orange may in future have difficulties using its 6 billion euro
undrawn syndicated credit facility, whose main maturity date is 2021,
if several of the banks with which the Company has agreements were
to face liquidity problems or could no longer meet their obligations.

Finally, its cash management investments expose Orange to counterparty
risk if the financial institutions where it has invested should go
bankrupt. See Note 12.5 Credit risk and counterparty risk management
to the consolidated financial statements.

The international banking system is such that financial institutions are
interdependent. As a result, the collapse of a single institution (or even
rumors regarding the financial position of one of them) may increase
the risk for the other institutions, which would increase exposure to
counterparty risk for Orange. Orange's positioning in regulated
activities in the banking sector focuses this risk on certain Group.
entities.

For customer-related credit and counterparty risk, see Note 12.5 and
Note 4.3 Trade receivables to the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign exchange risk

Orange’s results and cash position are exposed to exchange rate
fluctuations.

In general, currency markets remained highly volatile during 2016 and
at the start of 2017, increasing uncertainty over exchange rate
fluctuations.

Orange / 2016 Registration Document

The main currencies in which Orange is exposed to a major foreign
exchange risk are the Polish zloty, the Egyptian pound, the US dollar
and the British pound sterling. Intra-period variations in the average
exchange rate of a particular currency could significantly affect the
revenues and expenses denominated in that currency, which would
significantly affect Orange's results, as happened, for example, with
the near 50% devaluation of the Egyptian pound in November 2016.
In addition to the main currencies, Orange operates in other monetary
zones, including certain emerging countries (African countries). A fall
in the currencies of these countries would have an adverse effect on
the Group's consolidated revenues and results. Based on 2016 data,
the theoretical impact of a 10% rise against the euro in the main
currencies in which the Group's subsidiaries operate would have cut
consolidated revenues by 867 million euros (-2%) and reported
EBITDA by 195 million euros (-2%).

Finally, as a result of focusing its development strategy on emerging
countries, the share of Group business exposed to foreign exchange
risk could rise in the future.

When preparing the Group's consolidated financial statements, the
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euros
at the fiscal year closing rate. This translation could have a negative
impact on the consolidated balance sheet, assets and liabilities and
equity, for potentially significant amounts, as well as on net income in
the event of disposal of these subsidiaries.

Orange manages the foreign exchange risk on commercial transactions
(stemming from operations) and financial transactions (stemming from
financial debt) in the manner set out in Note 12.2 to the consolidated
financial statements.

Notably, Orange makes use of derivatives to hedge its exposure to
foreign exchange risk but cannot guarantee that suitable hedging
instruments will be available at reasonable prices.

To the extent that Orange has not used hedging instruments to hedge
part of this risk, its cash flows and results could be affected.

See Notes 11.8 Derivative (excluding Orange Bank) to the consolidated
financial statements.

Telecommunications operators’ revenues totaled 32.2 billion euros
over 12 months, at the end of the third quarter of 2016, down by 1.6%
in one year (source: Arcep, Q3 2016). While fixed-line telephony
revenues continued their downward trend as a result of the steady
decline in line numbers, fixed broadband revenues continued their
growth due to the increasing number of accesses. The decline in
revenues from mobile services, which was interrupted in 2015,
resumed in 2016 due to the pressure from competition.

Fixed telephony market

Telephone contracts (39.0 million at September 30, 2016) continued
on a downward trend (0.3% year-on-year at Q3 2016). In fact, the
higher number of broadband telephone contracts (27.2 million in the
third quarter of 2016, up by 1.1 million year-on-year) did not offset the
declining number of PSTN contracts -1.2 million year-on-year). Fixed
lines in voice over IP only (21.0 million at the end of September 2016,
or +0.4 million year-on-year) have held the lion's share and have been
expanding consistently. In addition, the number of fully unbundled
lines, which stood at 11.6 million lines at the end of September 2016,
was decreasing (Source: Arcep, Q3 2016).

The number of high-speed and very high-speed broadband Internet
accesses was 27.5 million at September 30, 2016, up by 3.3%. The
growth in the overall number of Internet accesses was entirely driven
by the increased number of very high-speed broadband accesses,
which accounted for 5 million accesses (Source: Arcep, Q3 2016).

The growth in revenues from fixed services (telephone and Internet),
which totaled 16.9 billion euros over 12 months at Q3 2016 was
driven by the increase in broadband and very high-speed broadband,
which accounted for 65.1% of the overall revenues from fixed services
(source: Arcep, Q3 2016).

So-called convergence offers (bundled fixed-line and mobile
telephony, Internet access and TV) continue to grow. The increased
use of the Internet was driven by the growth of social networks, TV,
as well as music and video downloads.

Mobile telephony market

The total number of SIM cards reached 83.4 million at September 30,
2016. The 1.6 million rise in cards year-on-year at Q3 2016 remained
driven by contracts. Conversely, the number of prepaid cards
continued to fall with a decrease of 1.5 million (Source: Arcep,
Q3 2016). Excluding Machine to Machine (M2M) cards, the number
of SIM cards reached about 72.5 million, or a penetration rate of 109%
of the population.

The market of dedicated connected object SIM cards continued to
grow and the number of M2M cards reached 10.9 million at
September 30, 2016. However, their increase was impacted by the
withdrawal of about 1.5 million SIM cards by one operator in 2016.
Me2M SIM cards are used to connect remotely to devices (vehicle fleet
tracking, remote reading of meters, sensors, alarms, remote interventions).

Outgoing traffic from mobiles reached 39.3 billion minutes at Q3 2016,
an increase of 5.6% compared with Q3 2015. Changes in
consumption trends continued to boost data services, the traffic of
which grew by 86% at Q3 2016. Mobile services generated
14.1 billion euros in revenue over 12 months at Q3 2016, down by
about 169 million year-on-year (Source: Arcep, Q3 2016).

The number of SMS and MMS sent (52.7 billion) during the third
quarter of 2016 continued to rise, but at a slower rate (3.9% year-on-
year). The number of MMS sent continued to grow annually at a fast
rate (20% at Q3 2016).

Traditional fixed-line telephony services

Further to the rapid growth in full unbundling, Wholesale Line Rental,
and wholesale naked ADSL access to third-party Internet service
providers, traditional telephony service business is on the decline. The
downward trend has nevertheless slowed down thanks to a marketing
policy aimed at mainstreaming offers while offering more exhaustive
services.

Online, Internet access and Multimedia services

At end-December 2016, Orange had a total of 11.2 million broadband
Internet customers, an increase of 3.9% year-on-year. The growth of
convergent offers continued in 2016, with the number of Open
customers (fixed and mobile) reaching 7.8 million at end-2016
(411.2% compared with December 2015). IP telephony had
10.2 million customers at end-December 2016 and continued to grow
in 2016 (+5.7%). Television by ADSL and satellite grew by 2.9%, with
6.6 million customers at end-December 2016.

The broadband customer base increased by 3.9%, with a share of
approximately 50% of new broadband and very high-speed
broadband subscriptions over the year, thanks to the commercial
success of fiber and convergence offers. The broadband ARPU
improved by 0.9%, thanks to the greater share of fiber services within
the customer base.

In May 2016, Orange launched a new Livebox improving the line and
Wi-Fi speed, particularly with Orange's fiber. This new box provides
new features such as the creation of storage spaces on a local hard
drive, access to files stored on Orange's Cloud via an application, or

Orange / 2016 Registration Document

mainstreaming of the installation process. In addition to its new
Livebox, Orange launched a new TV decoder in May 2016 that makes
it possible to improve customer experience, notably thanks to a
wireless connection with the Livebox and the Ultra High Definition 4K
technology quadrupling the picture resolution compared with High
Definition, as well as a 3D sound with Dolby Atmos technology.

Internet portals and advertising management business

The Group's main Internet portal, Orange.fr, has multi-screen
availability - web, mobile and tablet — and is amongst the five leading
websites in France, with close to 25 million Internet users each month.
As the leading French fixed Internet website, this portal ranks 5th after
Google, Facebook, YouTube and Microsoft, with 19.5 million unique
visitors each month. With 5.7 million unique visitors each day,
orange.fr ranks 3rd in terms of daily web traffic, behind Google and
Facebook. On mobile screens, orange.fr attracts 12.2 million mobile
users as well as 5.2 million tablet users each month (source: Panel
Médiamétrie/Netratings Audience, fixed Internet traffic, November 2016
— Global Internet, mobile and tablet, September 2016).

Content-related activities
See the Content subsection of Section 3.1.8.2 Shared Services.
Carrier services

Carrier services include interconnection services for competing
operators and unbundling and wholesale market services (ADSL and
fiber), regulated by Arcep. Carrier services as a whole are growing, in
particular data collection and transfer services for carriers and access
services to FTTH lines rolled out by Orange.

At the end of 2016, the total number of Orange mobile customers.
was 30 million, up by 5.7%. This was due to the significant growth in
contracts (including M2M), while prepaid offers continue to decline.
Orange increased its subscriber base to 26.5 million contracts at end-
December 2016 (up by 9.7% compared with 2015), thanks to its
segmentation strategy for the Retail and Enterprise markets and the
development of M2M offers.

Orange is present in all market segments, including the entry-level
market, offering contracts under the Sosh brand, available only on the
Internet, with no commitment and no handset. Sosh had a total of
3.3 million customers at end-December 2016.

The number of Orange 4G customers was approximately 11.3 million
at December 31, 2016, a year-on-year increase of 3.3 million
customers. Since 2015, Orange only markets 4G offers, including so-
called entry-level packages (Sosh Mini, Zen). Orange's key offerings
have grown but remain divided into four main ranges:

Mini offers are for customers who need only a small amount of
Internet connectivity, but wish to use additional services (Orange
Cloud and TV), as well as benefit from round-the-clock support
including a loan telephone in the event of a fault, breakage or theft;

the Zen offer allows for increased Internet connectivity and
communications;

Play offers are suitable for more intense Internet usage and
international connectivity and allow for low-price smartphones
upgrades;

- Jet offers are for customers wanting the best smartphones and very
intense Internet usage in France and abroad.

Orange pressed ahead with its family-based strategy through its
flagship Open offer and the development of multi-line contracts. The
Open offers are available in the same ranges as traditional mobile
offers (Zen, Play and Jet) and include the same level of service. This
refurbishment increased the volume of offers on the core Open and
Mobile ranges and also helped to improve the premium customer mix
in 2016, as reflected by the growth of the contract customer mix
(88.2% of customers at end-December 2016, compared with 84.9%
at end-2015).

At the same time, the MVNO customer base hosted on the Orange
network continued to decline (-7% year-on-year after -25% in 2015)
due to the success of low-cost offers and heightened competition at
the entry level.

Average monthly Revenues Per User (ARPU) were down 1.3% at end-
2016 compared with December 2015. This decline in average
revenues compared with 2015 reflects a market that continues to be

perturbed by regular and aggressive promotional campaigns as well
as decreased revenues, particularly in Roaming.

Machine to Machine SIM cards continued to grow (nearly +50%
year-on-year), reaching a total number of 5.7 million at end-
December 2016. The M2M segment is one of Orange’s growth
drivers.

On the background of fierce competition and market restructuring,
Orange has retained its leadership in the traditional business areas of
access and continued to innovate by launching new services, such
as Orange Cash mobile payments.

Revenue trends confirmed the recovery in 2016, with a growth of 1%,
(compared with a decrease of 3.5% in 2015), associated with the
growing usage of very high-speed broadband data, which in turn was,
boosted by the development of 4G and FTTH networks. In addition,
convergence has become common-place on the market.

Fixed-line telephony and Internet market

The number of fixed telephone lines decreased by 0.1% in 2016, while
the number of Internet customers reached 14 million, an increase of
4.9% (compared with +4.1% in 2015).

The Spanish market was marked by the growth of very high-speed
broadband throughout 2016. Telefonica, Orange/Jazztel and
Vodafone/ONO made massive investments in FTTH technology, which
made it possible to reach over 31 million connected households at
end-2016. The number of FTTH subscribers reached 5 million at end-
2016.

Convergence is now the norm on the market. The number of mobile
and fixed access convergence offers reached 10.9 million, i.e. over
78% of the overall customer base (source: Orange estimate).
Convergence offers, including TV, also saw a strong growth, thereby
accelerating the development of the audiovisual content market. At
the end of 2015, 6 million customers had subscribed to TV services,
attracted by the new football broadcast offers, richer content, and the
arrival of major TV broadcasters (HBO, Netflix).

Mobile telephony market

The total number of customers rose by 1.8% in 2016, reaching
67.2 million. The proportion of contracts grew by 4.1%, reaching
44.4 million and accounting for 78% of the overall customer base. On
the other hand, the number of prepaid customers fell 2.9% to
12.8 million. The number of convergence offer customers reached
20 million, accounting for over 51% of the overall customer base. Very
high-speed broadband mobile services continued to grow. At the end
of 2016, over 21 million customers had signed up to a 4G plan,
corresponding to a 37% penetration of the mobile market (source:

Following the successful integration of Jazztel into Orange Espana
during the second half of 2015, both carriers turned into one company
in 2016. Orange Espafia based the strategy of the new company on
the combined potential of the 4G and FTTH networks, boosted by
improved services, the increased number of TV customers, and the
expanded convergence of the customer base.

2016 was marked by a growth of 6.0% in revenues on a comparable
basis (+17.9% on a historical basis), backed by increased revenues
from services. Revenues generated by fixed services grew by 5.0%
on a comparable basis, while mobile services continued to improve,

with revenues of 2.6 billion euros in 2016, up by 7.7% on a comparable
basis. The success of its convergence offers enabled Orange to
expand its broadband customer base by 5% in one year.

Orange was able to significantly boost its very high-speed broadband
(VHBB) capacity, with 9.6 million connectable households at end-
2016. In 2016, Orange's FTTH customer base (including Jazztel)
doubled, reaching 1.6 million subscribers at the end of the year.

TV offers also worked as growth drivers. At the end of 2016, Orange
TV had 507,000 subscribers (corresponding to a 1.7-fold increase in

the TV customer base from 2015), thanks to the success of the
football broadcast offers and improved contents.

In respect of the mobile market, Orange maintained its position as top
net seller and also expanded its subscriber base to 12.7 million, up
5.8% over 2015. Orange's strategy focuses on providing value-for-
money, high-quality services, including low-cost offers, to meet the
needs of all customer segments. Orange Espafa reviewed its
convergence offer by replacing it with an offer called Love, which was.
very popular, and introducing new high-value offers to meet the
growing demand of data users. Orange Espaiia is also a key player
on the low-cost market with offers available only on the Internet,
Amena and Simyo, as well as Mundo, which targets migrants. Simyo
reached 802,000 customers in 2016 and Amena 376,000. Moreover,
Orange Espafha markets a wide range of 4G offers, both for
convergent and mobile-only customers, whose customer base,
reaching 7.9 million in December 2016, increased by a factor of 1.5
in comparison with 2015.

In 2016, the Polish economy continued to grow at a slightly faster
pace than in 2015. At the same time, low oil and common consumer
goods prices kept deflation at 0.6% in 2016, while the unemployment
rate fell to 8.3% (source: Central Polish Bureau of Statistics). These
factors had a positive impact on households disposable income and
consumption, which grew more than 3.6%.

Fixed telephony market

The penetration rate of fixed lines continued to decline, shrinking by
5.0% in 2016 and accounting for 20% of the population at year-end,
compared with 21% at end-2015. The total number of fixed
broadband lines fell in 2016, resulting from the growth of LTE-based
mobile broadband. This process was particularly marked in rural or
less urbanized areas that are seldom covered by very high-speed
broadband (fiber or cable) infrastructures.

Mobile telephony market

The number of mobile telephony customers fell by 2.7% in 2016. This
is mainly due to the implementation of a decree mandating the
registration of all prepaid cards as well as carriers deactivating certain
prepaid SIM cards that were generating neither traffic nor revenue.
Following this decree, all carriers saw a decrease in their gross sales,
with a decline in their casual users. At end-December 2016, the
mobile penetration rate stood at 144.2% of the population.

Broadband Internet market share

Orange Polska

Source: Orange Polska estimates.

As in the case of fixed-line telephony, affected by a strong shift to
mobile services for several years now, the growing success of mobile
broadband has impacted the development of fixed broadband, which
decreased in 2016. This trend gathered momentum as all mobile
operators launched 4G services and attractive mobile broadband
offers (in terms of prices or high or even unlimited data traffic), as well
as improved geographical coverage. LTE technology was also used
in Poland to offer mobile Wi-Fi broadband terminal services (for
instance at home).

In the fixed broadband market, Orange Polska is still under strong
competitive pressure from cable television operators, whose market
share is climbing steadily. Their overall position on the market is
constantly growing, mainly thanks to the success of their TV offers.
The commercial offers of these operators are also backed by the
investments they make in infrastructure to deploy the DOCSIS 3.0
standard and expand fiber access. Cable operators are also
expanding their offers towards SoHo and SME client segments.

Alternative operators, primarily Netia, still make use of bitstream and
unbundling services. However, the total volume of lines using bistream
access has been falling for several years now, and there were 110,000
unbundled lines at end-2016, compared with 131,000 a year earlier.

‘Source: Orange Polska estimates.

Poland has four main mobile telephony operators: Orange Polska,
T-Mobile (wholly owned by Deutsche Telekom), Polkomtel (operating
under the PLUS brand, in association with broadcaster and satellite
TV platform Polsat Cyfrowy, owned by Polish magnate Zygmunt
Solorz-Zak), and P4 (held by Tollerton Investments Ltd and Novator
Telecom Poland SARL, operating under the PLAY brand). In 2016, the
four main mobile carriers represented 98% of the total number of
active SIM cards in Poland.

Orange Polska’s estimated market share had increased slightly to
29.3% at end-2016. The compulsory registration of prepaid cards led
to a decrease in the customer base of all carriers. In 2016, Orange saw
a sharp increase in its contract services — ranking second in terms of
net sales on the market — as well as a growth for the third year in a row.

Growing differences in the methodologies used between operators in
the calculation of SIM cards make it is increasingly difficult to compare
the data presented by these operators.

Convergent solutions

Amain strategic objective of Orange Polska is to lead in convergence,
by marketing bundled fixed-line and mobile offers. Addressing
households telecommunications needs in a comprehensive manner
and getting mobile customers to buy additional services, convergence
improved customer satisfaction and retention, as the customer
renewal rate is much lower than that of single-service users. It also
helps increase revenues and improves efficiency of expenses for
information systems and marketing. In consumer services, Orange
Polska is the only operator offering convergence solutions, which is a
differentiating factor and gives it a competitive edge.

Orange Polska markets its push convergent solution, both on the
consumer and business customer (small to medium size enterprises)
markets. The main factors contributing to the expansion and appeal
of convergence solutions are the rollout of the fiber network and the
development of an IPTV offer based on content aggregation. The total
number of services sold as part of convergence solutions reached
nearly 4 million, or an average of more than four services used per
customer.

Fixed voice

The number of fixed lines continued to fall, with a net loss of voice
customers (traditional STN or VoIP). This decline could mainly result
from structural demographic factors as well as the growing appeal of
mobile services offering unlimited calls across all networks.

Orange Polska is pursuing its efforts to counter the decline in its fixed-
line subscribers, mainly using convergence solution services.

Fixed broadband access

In 2016, Orange Polska recorded a fall of 68,000 fixed broadband
accesses compared with 136,000 in 2015. This slower reduction
results exclusively from an increase of 50% of the very high-speed
broadband customer base. This increase was backed by significant
investments in the fiber network and ADSL migration, which has
become less and less competitive. Therefore, the share in very high-
speed broadband services reached about 25% of fixed broadband
accesses (compared with 15% at end-2015). Broadband ARPU
slightly decreased in 2016, as the impact of significant price
reductions in 2015 was partially offset by the cross selling of services.

Orange Polska’s initiatives in the fixed broadband segment are aligned
with the objectives announced in February 2016 as part of its
medium-term action plan. Orange Polska focuses on a differentiated
approach in large, medium-size and small cities, as well as rural areas,
by taking into account local differences in the competitive
environment, the potential in relation to population density, and
customer needs. In large cities, Orange Polska is focusing on
developing the FTTH coverage and improving its fixed broadband
market share. Its main objective is to maintain its fixed broadband
customer base by capitalizing on its excellent position in the mobile
market through cross selling of fixed and mobile services. However,
mobile technologies in rural areas are the first solution for broadband
access.

Orange Polska had around 16 million mobile customers at end-2016,
slightly up by about 84,000, or +0.5% compared with end-2015.

Contract customers increased by 1.1 million, along with an excellent
commercial momentum that started in 2015. This growth results from
commercial activities and the acceleration of prepaid migration, as
well as initiatives aimed at reducing churn rate. The distribution
between new business, retail and M2M card customers is balanced.

Orange / 2016 Registration Document

On the other hand, the prepaid card customer base sharply fell. This
is largely due to the compulsory registration of cards that came into
force in July 2016. However, most of the decrease was in single-use
and low-income revenue, and it has no significant impact on
corresponding revenues.

The average revenues per subscriber decreased by 6% in 2016. This
decrease results from multiple factors: successful offers with multiple
SIM cards, development of offers with no handset purchases, handset


--- Page 50 ---

credit sales (where the income share corresponding to the handset
sale is excluded from the ARPU calculation), discounts related to
convergence solution contracts, decreased prices mainly on the B2B
segment, and a slower growth in incoming traffic compared with 2015.

Distribution

Orange Polska has different distribution channels: traditional physical
points of sale (owned by Orange, franchised, or independent), online
sales, call centers, and doorstep sales.

Orange Polska specifically focuses on developing the online sales
channel, promoting the cross utilization of its various distribution
channels, and upgrading its physical points of sale, in order to improve
customer satisfaction and enhance its efficiency. At end-2016, Orange
Polska held:

= approximately 755 points of sale and franchises, offering a

In 2015, the Group was awarded two 5 MHz frequency blocks, each
in the 800 MHz band, and three 5 MHz frequency blocks in the
2,600 MHz band, which had been auctioned by the regulatory
authority (UKE). After being awarded these frequencies, Orange
developed the LTE technology using the 800 MHz band to expand
the coverage of its mobile broadband access services, while the 2,600
MHz band was mainly used to increase the capabilities in areas where
mobile data traffic was particularly high.

Orange Polska also continued its cooperation in sharing radio access
networks (RAN) with T-Mobile. In December 2016, the network
sharing was expanded to 800 MHz and 2,600 MHz bands. A joint
company managing radio networks owned by Orange and T-Mobile,
NetWorkS!, was also created as part of this cooperation.

At end (2016,) the coverage of Orange's LTE services reached more
than 99% of the population and more than 90% of the country.

The Belgian economy continued to grow at a slightly faster pace in
2016 compared with 2015, backed by stronger household
consumption. Inflation was greater than the average in the euro zone
due to increased indirect taxation and salary indexation. The
unemployment rate continued to decline in 2016, falling below 8%
towards the end of the year.

Fixed-line telephony market

Following the resumption of growth in 2015, the fixed-line telephony
market in Belgium maintained a steady pace in 2016. The return to
growth is mainly related to the residential market, particularly due to
the higher prices for digital TV and fixed-line broadband services
driven by a steady increase in the demand for these services. This
positive trend largely offset the decline in fixed telephony services. The
business market slightly decreased in 2016, mainly due to the decline
in income from fixed-line telephony.

Orange / 2016 Registration Document

Mobile telephony market

In 2016, the mobile telephony market was marked by a strong
demand for mobile data services. During the second half of 2016,
most mobile telephony carriers introduced new offers on the market
in order to meet the mobile data demand and to improve access to
intermediate and higher pricing plans. The share of prepaid versus
contract solutions is still changing in favor of contracts. This trend is
backed by the success of contract convergence solutions,
compulsory prepaid registration and the success of bundled offers
combining services and handsets. Most handsets in the market are
compliant with the 4G standard, which explains the steady increase
in smartphone penetration.

The competitive environment

The competitive structure of the fixed-line telephony market remained
relatively steady in 2016, with the predominance of the incumbent
operator Proximus and regional cable operators Telenet, VOO and
SFR. In December 2016, Telenet announced the acquisition of SFR
owned by Altice.

Triple play offers remain expensive and all operators in the market
announced price increases by early 2017. Cable distributors and
Proximus announced their intentions to invest in their own networks.
In terms of content strategy, cable operators focus on vertical
integration by purchasing or producing exclusive content and
controlling their broadcast channel, while Proximus aims to position
itself more as an aggregator.

In the mobile telephony market, the number and position of operators
changed in 2016 with the presence of three main operators instead
of four, following the acquisition of BASE by the cable operator
Telenet, in addition to many smaller MVNO. In line with 2015,
operators increasingly focused on promoting convergent solutions,
which have become the most important tool to expand their customer
base and retain customers.

Following the decrease in prices between 2012 and 2014, contract
prices have remained stable since 2015 (Source: IBPT). Price
reductions were observed in offers that included prepaid data.

2016 was a pivotal year for Orange Belgium, with the nation-wide
launch of an Internet and TV offer and as the company was renamed
to strengthen is position as a convergence operator in the retail and
business market.

At end-December 2016, Orange Belgium's customer base (excluding
M2M) stood at 2.97 million, including 2.25 million contracts, up by
+1.8%, and included 0.72 million prepaid customers, down by
-12.8%. The MVNO customer base was 2.04 million (+14.4%), with
0.83 million active M2M cards.

With its Internet and TV offer, Orange Belgium has become the first
operator in Belgium to offer a nation-wide cable network, which led
to a strong growth in its customer base.

Moreover, Orange Belgium reorganized all of its offers in 2016 by
placing a strong emphasis on data. The number of Orange Belgium's
smartphone users exceeded 2 million, including more than 1.4 million
4G smartphone users. Therefore, smartphones accounted for 68%
of Orange Belgium's total customer base, while the penetration rate
of 4G and 4G + smartphones reached 48% and 10%, respectively.
At the end of December 2016, 4G traffic accounted for over 80% of
total traffic. Customers opting for 4G show a higher level of
satisfaction and consume more mobile data compared with other
customers, which translates into a greater average income per
subscriber. Hence in 2016, the ARPU grew by +2.7%.

The new name Orange Belgium, combined with the launch of
convergence solutions, also contributed to the consolidation of
Orange Belgium's position in the business segment by benefiting from
the international strength of the Orange group's portfolio.

Investment in mobile networks remained strong with the steady
deployment of 4G, mainly to expand coverage within homes, and to
invest in the core transmission network. At end-2016, Orange
Belgium's 4G coverage was 99.6% of the population outdoors and
91.9% indoors. 4G+ coverage, which provides customers with a

download speed up to three times faster than 4G, was 54.0%. In
addition, Orange Belgium increased its investments in equipment
installed on customer premises, such as decoders, modems and TV
remote controllers, as well as in the corresponding activation and the
installation costs for the Internet + TV offer.

In 2016, the growth in the mobile market slowed down in terms
volume at +1.5%, according to Orange Romania’s estimates,
although its value grew thanks to mobile data monetizing and
customers’ increased interest in abundance offers. Substantial
investments in fiber and content purchase resulted in the growth of

In 2016, the market focused on developing data services and 4G
deployment was competitive. All operators marketed unlimited and
abundance offers at competitive prices. In an increasingly competitive
market in terms of prices, data abundance and prepaid offers, Orange
saw a decrease in its market share in volume while dominating the
market in value. Subsidized smartphone offers accelerated the
migration from prepaid to contracts and promoted portability between
operators. The market grew towards three convergence operators
when Orange Romania joined Telekom and RCS&RDS in this market
in Q3 2016.

In 2016, the number of Orange Romania mobile customers stood at
10.1 million (including M2M), including 5 million subscribers, up by 3
percentage points compared with the previous year. This growth
results from the 4G deployment, a wider smartphone penetration and
the accelerated migration from prepaid to contracts. Orange
continued to include more data in its offers, by reorganizing its
portfolio and focusing it on families and households. These new offers
increased customers’ interest in tablets and smartphones, particularly
when they are 4G-compatible. Orange maintained its leadership in 4G
with 2 million customers at end-2016.

Orange entered the mobile financial services segment in November 2016,
with the launch of Orange Money. Payment and fund transfer services
are available to all customers nationally. Users can pay services,
recharge prepaid cards, receive or send money, using their mobile
phone. In September 2016, Orange launched Orange Home, its first
convergence service offer, in more than 90 Romanian cities, making
it possible to access up to 1 Gbits/s Internet, cable TV and fixed voice
services.

Orange TV service reached around 328,000 subscribers at the end
of the year, and the Orange TV Go complemented its contents with
more than 80 channels and 500 movies and TV series.

Orange continued to lead in terms of innovation through the launch
of Smart Home, a connected objects solution, and the implementation
of a Smart City solution in Alba lulia.

Finally, Orange consolidated its position as an innovative service
integrator for its business customers of any size, both through its
Orange Pro contract offer and integrated solutions impacting directly
their productivity.

In 2016, the Egyptian government undertook economic measures to
liberalize the Egyptian pound, partially eliminate energy price subsidies
and increase interest rates. Following these measures, the pound lost
more than half of its value, which significantly impacted both
production costs and living standards. Inflation increased from 19.4%
in November 2016 to 23.3% in December, and average short-term
borrowings interest rates reached 16.3% in December (Source: IMF
and Central Bank of Egypt).

In addition, the Egyptian tourism industry is still suffering from security-
related instability which, in turn, had a serious impact on roaming
revenues.

The National Telecom Regulatory Authority continued to impose
restrictions on the sales of lines for security reasons, which led, for
the first time in 2015, to a decrease in the number of mobile phone
subscribers in Egypt. In 2016, mobile operators undertook measures.
to overcome and mitigate the impact of these restrictions, which
resulted in a resumption of economic growth in the mobile market.
The mobile telephony market in Egypt essentially comprises prepaid
customers. Increasingly, operators are expanding their offers to the
lower end of the market, reducing connection fees, offering cheap
telephones and allowing customers to recharge small amounts. This.
strategy aims to attract middle-class and rural customers, and
resulted in a decrease in the average revenue per user (ARPU).

At the end of 2016, the number of mobile subscribers reached
97.8 million, an increase of 4% year-on-year, or a penetration rate of
107% of the population. The number of ADSL subscribers reached
4.4 million, an increase of 17% year-on-year.

The Egyptian market is characterized by an increasingly competitive
environment. Most competition is between mobile telephony
operators, but is also moving increasingly into Internet and B2B
markets. At the same time, OTT operators are competing in the
traditional telecommunications segment.

Despite the highly competitive market and regulatory pressure,
Orange successfully increased its customer base in 2016 and
maintained its second place, with a market share of 35.2%, behind
Vodafone, which remained the market leader with a market share of
40.9%, and before Etisalat in third position, with 23.9%.

Mobinil changed name to Orange in March 2016, notably to benefit
from a powerful international brand, solid mobile customer relationship
and a strong market footprint, a valuable customer base and a wide
product range and competitive offers. Orange's market position is
transitioning from an emotional bond with a brand perceived as that
of an Egyptian company to an internationally recognized brand that
offers state-of-the-art connectivity and services.

Orange's mobile customer base stood at 33.9 million at the end of
2016, with an increase of 2.4% compared with 2015. About 80% of
mobile customers are positioned on prepaid offers. However, the
proportion of prepaid customers decreased in 2016 due to the
success of capped usage contracts. In euros, the annual revenues
stood at 1.13 billion in 2016, a decrease of 15.3%.

The telecommunications market in Senegal comprises three players:
Orange, Tigo-Sentel (subsidiary of the Millicom International Group)
and Expresso Sénégal (subsidiary of Sudan Telecom). Despite a highly
competitive market, notably for abundance offers and data services,
Orange retained its first place in 2016, even though its mobile market
share dramatically decreased owing to the termination of customers
who do not satisfy the new identification criteria. This performance
results from the strengthened commercial offers and activities, notably
those developed around the mobile data services. With the
democratization of smartphones, the development of the mobile
network, the constant improvement of service quality and the
enrichment of offers made it possible for Orange to benefit greatly
from the explosion of mobile data applications.

The number of Orange mobile customers almost entirely comprises
prepaid options. After a growth of 3.9% in 2015, Orange's subscribers
base decreased by 6.1% in 2016 following the implementation of
compliance measures for subscribers bases, resulting in the termination
of more than customers who did not fulfill the new identification criteria.

Despite the decrease in the mobile subscribers base and the reduced
average price for voice services following the increase in the level of
free abundance offers, the ARPU remained fully stable compared with
2015 in view of, on the one hand, an enhanced monetization of mobile
data applications and value-added services, and, on the other hand,
the development of Orange Money. This relative stability for the ARPU
is all the more notable in that it is part of contracting mobile call
termination revenues impacted by the asymmetrical decrease of
mobile interconnection rates.

The development of the mobile Internet offer continued in 2016 with
the 3G and 4G Pass Internet options sold by retailers from 100 CFA

francs. As for the Orange Money mobile payment offer, which had
close to 1.1 million active customers at the end of 2016, or 14% of
the mobile customer base, it fully benefited from the expansion of the
partnership with new players in merchant payment and invoice
payment as well as the launch of new offers, which led to significant
growth in the volume of transactions (+73%) compared with 2015.

Distribution

Orange's distribution network is made up of:

= one center bringing together the direct distribution network's
commercial activities around seven regional sales departments and
managing 37 directly owned stores, 11 of which are in Dakar;

= and one branch dedicated to the development of sales by indirect
networks, which notably comprise 116 Orange stores and 60,360
indirect partners (wholesalers — semi-wholesalers — retail vendors).

successfully improved its market share, which stood at 45.2% at the
end of 2016 (compared with 42.5% at the end of 2015), therefore

Hence, Orange Morocco confirmed its 2nd place in the market,
behind Morocco Telecom and before Wana Telecom, whose mobile

market shares at end-2016 were 44% and 23%, respectively. In
addition, the number of Orange Morocco mobile Internet subscribers.
stood at 3.8 million at the end of December 2016, which represents
a market share of 23.8% (source ANRT).

Among the highlights for 2016, Orange Morocco notably:

reviewed its residential and B2B offers in accordance with new
regulatory guidelines, and ended the marketing of its unlimited offers;

submitted a complaint to the ANRT against IAM for anticompetitive
practices in the context of unbundling;

reestablished on November 4, as instructed by the regulatory
authorities, VoIP, which had been interrupted since January 1,
2016, which accelerated the decrease in outgoing and incoming
international traffic;

transferred all of its business activities and offers from the Meditel
brand to the Orange brand;

continued to provide innovative and attractive support for the
development of the contract market.

3.1.6.16 Niger

The most recent company to join the mobile market, Orange Niger is
the second-largest operator, with a mobile market share of 29.5%
(source: Orange estimates). This position remained unchanged
despite the establishment of the public operator Niger Télécom, which
resulted in an alliance with Sonitel and Sahelcom at the end of 2016.

At the end of 2016, Orange Niger's base comprised 1.6 million active
mobile customers with a coverage of 82% of the population. As the
first operator to have launched the 3G network, from 2011, Orange
Niger is also leading the broadband mobile Internet market.

Orange Niger's business activities draw on a direct distribution
network of 10 stores, in addition to an indirect distribution network
comprising 28 distributors and more than 22,000 points of sale across
the country.

3.1.6.17 Central African Republic

The growth of telecommunications, the potential of which is significant
as the penetration rate remains low, is still affected by the country's
challenges (strong inflation, infrastructure deficiency), particularly due
to the conflicts that have been known since 2013.

Orange is the most recent company to join the market, which
comprises four operators. Orange has more than 400,000 active
mobile subscribers, most of them being prepaid customers. After
being the first operator to launch the 3G network in 2013, Orange has
provided the four main cities of the country with mobile data services
through its positioning in offers to companies, organizations and
international military forces. In addition, Orange is the only operator
to provide mobile payment services since it launched its Orange
Money offer in 2016.

Orange Central African Republic has the second-largest distribution
network in the country in terms of scale, with a total of 109 sites, and
draws on direct and indirect distribution channels comprising
30 distributors and 8,000 resellers.

3.1.6.18 Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Democratic Republic of the Congo has a population of
84.1 million, putting it in fourth place in Africa in terms of population
(source: IMF, October 2016). However, the mobile penetration rate is
only 36% (source: Telecommunications and Postal Services
Regulatory Authority of Congo, Q3 2016), which is a much lower level
than that of most neighboring countries.

Overview of the Group’s business
Overview of business

In 2016, the country’s overall economic environment was marked by
difficulties, notably following the depreciation of the Congolese franc
compared with the American dollar (two currencies used in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo) and the expected institutional
changes, notably the delay in the presidential elections that were
initially due in November 2016.

In acontext of weak mobile penetration representing a huge potential
for growth, Orange, which already held a 2G and 3G national license,
strengthened its position in 2016 by acquiring the operator Oasis in
April 2016, which was operating under the Tigo brand. Through this
acquisition, Orange managed to further develop its market position
by reaching second place in terms of mobile market share, with
30.8%, or 1.6 point behind the leader, and by becoming a leader in
the mobile Internet segment, with a market share of 41.6%, far ahead
of its competitor AIRTEL at 32.7% (source: Telecommunications and
Postal Services Regulatory Authority of Congo, Q3 2016).

The number of Orange mobile customers, which stood at 5.3 million
at the end of 2015, reached 7.3 million at the end of 2016, or an
increase of 38%, mainly due to the purchase of Oasis. On a
comparable basis, the customer base is in fact down 27%
considering the negative impact of the depreciation of the Congolese
franc and the law on subscriber's identification, which significantly
slowed down acquisitions, particularly during the first half of 2016. In
this context, Orange DRC’s revenues contracted by 10% during 2016.

3.1.6.19 Sierra Leone

Sierra Leone has 6.4 million inhabitants, many of which live in rural
areas. The country’s GIP grew by 4.3% in 2016, with an inflation of
more than 9.7% (Source: IMF. October 2016). Its economy has been
weakened by its dependency on the US dollar.

The subsidiary was acquired by Orange in July 2016. It has 1.5 million
customers. As population’s mobile coverage and mobile penetration
rates are low, the country therefore has a strong growth potential. In
an environment where the percentage of people with bank accounts
is low, almost one out of two customers is involved in Orange Money's
activities. Ultimately, international communications, liberalized in
April 2016, offer a growth opportunity.

3.1.6.20 Tunisia

Orange Tunisia is the 3rd largest fixed and mobile operator in Tunisia
which, since it joined the mobile market in 2010, has established a
strong position in the 3G segment. Orange Tunisia's strategy, focused
on developing data services, continued in 2016 through the launch
of 4G.

At the end of 2016, Orange Tunisia had 4.3 million mobile customers
(an increase of 316,000 customers compared with 2015), or a mobile
market share of 26% (source: Instance Nationale des Télécom-
munications (|NT)), an increase of 3 points compared with the end of
2015. In addition, the company confirmed its leading position in the
mobile Internet segment, with a market share of 40.1% (source: INT).

Orange Tunisia’s growth strategy is based on an innovative and
diverse commercial offer, particularly in the prepaid mobile and mobile
Internet segments. This dynamic was strengthened in 2016 through
the launch of number portability, which allowed Orange Tunisia to
acquire 27,000 new mobile numbers, or 58.5% of the total number
of portabilities carried out. In addition to the continued development
of distribution, as regards technical developments, 2016 saw the
successful rollout of 4G and the continuation of the plan for extending
and densifying the network.

communications and IT services market. This market is part of the
broader Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector,
which includes technologies used to process and send information.
Worldwide this market represented nearly 1,300 billion euros in 2016,
with telecommunications accounting for slightly less than 40% of this
total:

Orange Business Services offers a range of services to key accounts,
local authorities and SMEs in France, as well as to multinationals
around the world, supporting their digital transformation and the
implementation of their communication projects. To achieve this, and
thereby become the trusted partner in the digital transformation of its
customers, Orange Business Services offers a full range of services,
primarily in the fixed-line communications and IT services markets.

Worldwide, the contraction in fixed-line connectivity services (voice
and data), on one hand, and the sharp increase in IT services, on the
other hand, led to overall market growth of approximately 3%, at
constant exchange rates, in 2016:

= the connectivity market continued to decrease in 2016, with a
contraction between 2 and 2.5%, at constant exchange rates. The
decline in the legacy voice and data markets was only slightly offset

Orange / 2016 Registration Document

by the demand for IP VPN networks and broadband and very high-
speed broadband networks, particularly Ethernet;

= the IT services market grew by about 4.5%, still at constant
exchange rates, with the various services — consulting, integration,
outsourcing, product support — all contributing to this growth.

In France, the market continued to grow in 2016 at a rate of more
than 1%. The ongoing decline in the fixed-line voice market together
with the erosion of the fixed-line data market, were largely offset by
the growth in the IT services market:

= the Enterprise network services market continued to decline, by
around 4% in 2016. The fixed-line voice market continued to
contract, due to the lower number of accesses, the erosion of
prices, technological migration (SIP) and substitution by other
methods of communication (mobile telephony, unified
communications, email, OTT services Over-The-Top, etc.). Also, the
data market continued to fall as growth in the broadband and very
high-speed broadband markets did not offset the sharp downward
trend in the legacy services market, along with the decline in the
MPLS networks market;

= the IT services market saw an acceleration of its growth, which
amounted to about 3% in 2016. This growth, which was continually
revised upwards during the year by analysts and industry
associations such as Syntec Numérique, reflects the healthy state
of the consulting, integration and outsourcing services markets.

In terms of the business market, the major trends are as follows:

= the boundaries between the various players, telecommunications
operators, integrators, editors, etc. are blurring due to the
commoditization of the networks and convergence: operators are
offering advanced communication services that are increasingly
integrated into businesses’ information systems, and are entering
into direct competition with integrators, editors and players from
the Internet world (including OTT). At the same time, Internet
companies are enhancing their IT services with network solutions
to take advantage of the rise in new usages such as Cloud
Computing; or providing value-added offers integrating an
increasing number of communication components above the
network (unified communications);

confronted with new mobility-related usages within businesses
(BYOD, Bring Your Own Device or BYOA, Bring Your Own
Application for instance), both operators and integrators are
updating their services line-up to meet customers’ needs as
regards administration, security, applications, and value-added
services;

regional expansion is another growth driver, both for operators in
advanced economies that extend to emerging or developing
countries and operators from these countries that secure market
shares in advanced countries;

lastly, companies may turn to acquisitions and partnerships to
speed up their transition to new business models, whether via
acquisitions or partnerships.

3.1.7.2 The competitive environment
Orange's main competitors on Enterprise market are:
= telecommunications operators:

- SFR Business, the Numericable-SFR group entity operating
the Enterprise business: SFR Business offers a range of fixed-
line, mobile and Internet solutions, and now works in tandem
with Completel, since the merger-acquisition of SFR by
Altice/Numericable, and also provides IT services, in particular
following the purchase of Telindus France,

- alternative local loop operators like Colt, that can target French
companies as well as multinationals,

- global telecom services operators, such as BT Global Services,
Verizon Entreprises, AT&T Business Services, T-Systems,
NTT Communications and also Telefonica Business Solutions
(which operates in France via Telefonica Global Solutions France,
its joint-venture with Bouygues Telecom): they offer global
distributed services for multinational companies worldwide. In
addition to their international service offers, these operators can
also carry local and national calls in France by using the Orange
network's interconnection services,

— national telecom operators expending internationally, such as the
American Zayo, which made France the bridge to its growth in
Europe and operates via Zayo France, created in 2014 with the
acquisition of Neo Telecoms,

- international carriers from emerging countries like Tata
Communications, PCCW, SingTel and China Telecom, that
build hybrid solutions based on their own networks and
combined with third-party operators’ solutions that they manage
themselves,

— incumbent operators in some countries;

= network integrators and managed service providers with which
Orange works in “coopetition” (a combination of cooperation and
competition) — especially for companies developing a multi-provider
approach such as Spie ICS (previously Spie Communication) and
Dimension Data;

= players such as IBM, HP Enterprise, Atos, Capgemini, Econocom
as well as Sopra-Steria, which specialize in supporting companies
through their IT transformation projects; the main service categories
in which these companies are positioned include network
integration, infrastructure management, outsourcing, third-party
application maintenance (TPAM), consulting and engineering;

= Internet companies or niche market specialists that offer VoIP,
messaging, and Cloud Computing services: Microsoft Skype or
Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google or Salesforce.com which
operate globally, and the American specialist in network
virtualization, Masergy, or the French hosting services provider
OVH. It should be noted that the competitive position of OVH
improved in France, with the creation of the wholesale operator
Kose Telecom. The latter resulted from the purchase of
Completel’s DSL network, acquired by OVH through the Kosc
consortium;

= major software suppliers that offer their applications online as
services, like Microsoft, Oracle, SAP.

3.1.7.3 Orange Business Services activities

Orange Business Services is positioned as a reliable partner to
support customers with their digital transformation in France and
internationally. Orange Business Services activities focus on five key
challenges for its customers:

= the need for good connectivity at the right time, whether fixed or
mobile;

evolving towards more mobile and effective working methods
based on unified communication and collaboration solutions or the
popularity of smartphones and tablets in the corporate world;

= the need for more flexible IT infrastructures, thanks to virtualization
technologies and IT services provided upon request (as a Service);

the use of the Internet of Things, data analytics and multichannel
contact centers to improve business performance.

Orange Business Services meets these requirements with a
particularly close eye to the security of its customers’ data and
information systems through its subsidiary Orange Cyberdéfense,
which has more than 1,000 experts working on the topic.

--- Page 70 ---

These offers are also used to develop cross-sector business solutions
(finance, transport, energy, government and public sector, geolocation
and fleet management, etc.).

Distribution, operations and partnerships

The market comprising professionals, very small companies and
SMEs is managed by a country-wide commercial branch network
which, via sales personnel dedicated to a portfolio of customers
and/or telephone advisers, promotes and sells solutions, updates
customers on the status of their orders, and endeavors to provide
top-quality service.

In the large corporate accounts market, Orange Business Services
canvasses, advises and supports its customers by providing a range
of solutions and expertise to assist them in their development in
France and worldwide. Dedicated sales teams work in close
collaboration with customers in pre-sales, both during the sales
process and after-sales, to ensure Orange Business Services
represents a reliable partner in their digital transformation. They also
promote partnership-based approaches. Lastly, companies can
manage their contracts and place orders in real time using the Orange
website.

Orange Business Services also relies on international partners to
supplement its offer and geographical coverage in areas where its
customers operate and where its presence does not offer a
comprehensive solution. Orange Business Services is working to build
this type of partnership in the most developed markets, preferably
with the leading operator or its direct competitor, like NTT
Communications in Japan or AT&T in the United States.

3.1.8

3.1.8.1 International Carriers

The market

The global international voice market was estimated at 550 billion
minutes in 2015. Its growth was slowed down by the increase in the
“on-net” traffic of OTTs, but remains positive thanks to the
development of mobile telephony (in particular in Africa and through
the development of VoIP).

The wholesale of voice and data traffic, as well as the provision of
transmission means, accounted for approximately 65% of the total
international voice market and was estimated at 360 billion minutes
in 2014 (source: Telegeography 2016).

There were over 1,400 operators in the mobile market in 237 countries
(source: GSM Association), including 581 commercially operating
4G/LTE networks in 186 countries (source: GSA January 2017).

The competitive environment

Wholesale operators can be divided into three types — global
wholesalers, multinational retail operators and regional or specialist
players:

= global wholesalers have the critical mass needed to obtain the most
competitive rates and to pass them on to their customers: TATA,
BICS and iBasis are the main global wholesalers;

multinational retail operators aim to optimize their end-customers’
traffic and generate revenues and earnings in addition to those from
their retail traffic. Orange, Vodafone, Telefonica, Deutsche Telekom
and Telia Sonera are among the main ones;

lastly, regional and specialist players focus on a particular
geographical area or offer voice or data services, for which they
generally offer competitive rates. These primarily include Interoute,
Primus, Citic, and Calltrade.

Overview of the Group’s business
Overview of business

The Customer Service & Operations Division (CSO) is responsible for
the production and maintenance of solutions worldwide. Backed by
its geographical reach, the CSO supports customers in managing the
rollout of their network and IT projects and in the daily operation of
their services, including on-site call-outs. In some countries, CSO uses
local partners for local rollouts and to supply equipment. CSO
structures its operations using standardized processes and tools in
order to monitor and support its customers round the clock: two
Customer Service Units (CSU) for French customers, and five Major
Service Centers (MSC) located in India, Egypt, Brazil, Mauritius and
France, serving international customers. This system, together with
network redundancy, ensures service continuity for customers,
especially in the case of exceptional events (natural disasters, political
events, or a cut of submarine cables).

Orange Business Services works in close cooperation and bilaterally
with major technology players, such as Cisco, Microsoft, Alcatel-
Lucent, EMC, Avaya, Juniper, Polycom, Netapp, VMWare and
Genesys, or with members of the mobile industry, such as Samsung,
Apple and Blackberry. Orange Business Services also forms
partnerships with service companies, such as Akamai or GFI, to
develop a joint sales approach and offer innovative solutions to its
customers. 2016 saw the development of partnerships with French
digital services companies such as Altran, CGI, Sopra-Steria and
Proservia and IT integrators such as TechMahindra or Infosys. Also of
note was the strengthening of the technology partnership with Huawei
in the Cloud and Big Data spheres, and the expansion of the
partnership with EMC across the consolidation scope of Dell (servers
and workspaces).

International Carriers & Shared Services

The wholesale market's customer base comprises voice market
specialists (call-shop, prepaid cards), domestic retail carriers (including
MVNOs), and Internet service providers. International carriers also sell
wholesale traffic to each other.

International Carriers’ activity

Orange's International Carriers’ activity is based on a major long-
distance network infrastructure and offers a broad range of solutions
on the international market.

the retail operators. Orange has more than 1,000 customers, which
include fixed-line and mobile operators and Internet service, content
and OTT providers.

The Orange group is unique in that it is very involved in the design,
construction and operation of submarine cables. With its ownership
or co-ownership of several submarine cable systems, the Group ranks.
among the world’s largest owners of submarine lines. This has
enabled it to satisfy the increase in transatlantic traffic.

The Group's wholesale activity is based on:

= aseamless global network and an IPX protocol network supporting
voice and data with points of presence around the world;

= aglobal network of dedicated IP routes with end users in more than
220 countries, connections to more than 200 Internet service
providers, and connectivity in over 100 countries in a single IP
network hop (Autonomous System);

= 99.99% network availability, 24/7 centralized network supervision.

The volume of voice traffic in the International Carriers business
decreased by around 4% in 2016, and there was also a sustained
increase in data traffic.

3.1.8.2 Shared services

Orange continues to develop new growth activities, related to its core
business line, that add value, in the fields of content distribution and
audience monetization.

Content

Orange’s content strategy is primarily based on developing
partnerships with rights holders and service publishers. Orange is
mainly focused on its role of aggregator and distributor by referencing
the best entertainment services on offer to its customers through its
broadband networks.

The Group focuses on picture and sound quality, as well as on multi-
screen on-demand uses. Hence in 2016, Orange launched a new
Livebox in France, offering an richer content experience through
access to ultra-high-definition content and several virtual reality
services.

In Europe, the Group is pursuing its rollout strategy for content
services, including around TV, a key element of convergence offers.
In Spain, Orange is marketing TV channel selections, including football
offers, the distribution rights for which have been renewed since the
2016/2017 season. This TV strategy is also being developed in other
regions in Europe.

In Africa, Orange launched the IPTV in Ivory Coast at the end of 2016
and secured in mid-December a paying TNT license via a joint venture
with its partner Canal+ Overseas.

As regards edition, Orange focuses its efforts on France with its OCS
premium service (e.g. Orange Cinéma Series), whose new and
exclusive programs are available on linear broadcasting form and on
demand across all screens. OCS is offered by most distributors in
France and is now available in direct distribution on the Internet (OTT)
beyond the traditional distribution via FAI or satellite operators.

In the video on-demand (VOD) segment, Orange offers the programs
of the main rental and permanent download (EST) catalogs.

For music, Orange continues to innovate in the music streaming
segment, in partnership with Deezer since 2010 and through the
rollout of its Orange Radio service in the OMEA zone. 2016 was
marked by the growth of the number of Orange's paying customers
in France using the Deezer service.

In the highly innovative gaming sector, the streaming game offer on
Orange TV confirmed its growth. Over 200 games are now available
on an unlimited basis as part of the Pass Famille offer in France, with
no need to have any terminal other than the Orange box and a game.

demand), enabling them to monetize premium content and the user
experience in a multi-network and multi-screen environment. Its
portfolio includes the protection of content rights, service platforms,
and user commitment management solutions (introductory and
recommended content solutions).

In October 2016, Orange acquired 65% of Groupama Banque, which became Orange Bank at the start of 2017. The Orange Bank services
will be marketed in France in the first half of 2017. This offer will gradually provide a full range of banking services (means of payment, current
account, savings, credit facilities) and will be accessible via mobile phone, online and in the Orange France distribution network.

3.2 Network and real estate

3.2.1. Network

3.2.1.1

At the end of 2016, Orange operated networks in almost 30 countries
to serve its customers in the consumer market and in approximately
200 countries or territories to serve its business customers. These
networks enable Orange to provide its customers with ever greater
and enhanced connectivity wherever it operates.

Overview

In order to provide this enhanced connectivity, investment in networks
is designed to improve the Orange networks in a number of respects:

the development of very high-speed broadband (FTTH and 4G),
increased data transfer volumes and reduced connection latency;

implementation of the program to switch all services over to the IP
infrastructure (“all-IP" program);

preparation of the gradual virtualization of network control functions
(“programmability”);

automation of network operation and implementation of
mechanisms to personalize the quality of service provided to each
customer in line with his or her expectations.

The network architecture is broken down into:

= access networks (fixed or mobile);

= national and international transmission networks;
- IP transport networks;

= service control networks.

3.2.1.2 Fixed access networks
Analog access and ADSL/vDSL broadband access

Orange is a copper access network operator in France, Poland and
various countries in Africa (Ivory Coast, Jordan and Senegal).

Analog voice access services are provided to more than 12 million
customers in these countries.

Fixed broadband ADSL/VDSL access (for voice applications, Internet
access and television) is available:

= in France and in Poland, with cover approaching 100% on the
incumbent local loop;

= in MEA countries where Orange is the operator on the copper local
loop;

= in other countries (for example Egypt, Spain and Slovakia), using
the local loop of the incumbent operators, whether unbundled or
via bitstream-type offers;

= in Belgium, broadband offers are marketed using the cabled
network of third-party operators.

FTTH very high-speed broadband access

FTTH fiber optic access can extend the available broadband
ADSL/VDSL service offer to include upstream and downstream very
high-speed broadband (of 100 Mbits/s and more), with improved
performance, in particular response time.

In France, for several years Orange has deployed point-to-multipoint
FTTH architecture that uses GPON technology, which can pool
several very high-speed broadband accesses on a single fiber without
affecting each access point's capacity for increasing speed.

FTTH rollout started in 2007 in several major French cities and was
then expanded to other large cities. During the years 2011 and 2012,
Orange entered into sharing arrangements with other telecoms
operators to speed fiber optic rollout. At end-2016, Orange’s fiber had
been rolled out to 1,000 municipalities, including about ten with 100%
fiber, and more than 6.5 million eligible homes.

In Spain, the FTTH network offered connectivity to over 9.6 million
households. A FTTH fiber network was also rolled out in Poland, with
connectivity offered to some 1.5 million households at the end of
2016, as well as in Slovakia, where connectivity was offered to some
349,000 households at the end of 2016. The FTTH rollout also began
in Jordan and Ivory Coast.

Fixed Radio Access

In anumber of different countries, fixed services are available through
UMTS, Wimax (Romania and Africa), and CDMA (Poland and Senegal)
radio access. These services are migrating to the 4G (LTE) technology.

3.2.1.3 Mobile access networks

The GSM (2G), UMTS (3G) and LTE (4G) access networks support
faster data and voice communication services of up to several dozen
Mbits/s that can be used to send and receive large files (audio, photo
and video). The group operates a mobile network (2G/3G/4G) in each
of the countries where it offers consumer telecommunications services.

2016 was marked by:

increased growth of uses and traffic, across the group's networks.
To anticipate this growth, which will continue over the coming years,
the group invested in its networks to increase their capabilities and
performance;

continued rollout of 4G/4G+ networks in Europe to increase the
coverage of the population and speeds. For example, Orange
Belgium and Orange Polska offer a 4G coverage to 99% of the
population;

continued rollout of 4G networks in the MEA zone, with commercial
openings in about ten countries in 2016;

the start of the rollout of a radio network for the Internet of Things,
using the LoRa (Long Range) technology, in 18 urban areas in France.

3.2.1.4 Transmission networks
Domestic networks

This infrastructure is primarily made up of fiber optic, but it also
contains microwave links, especially for alternative or purely mobile
networks in MEA countries.

Optical links offer a bandwidth of up to 100 Gbits/s per wavelength,
and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing technology (DWDM)
makes it possible to have 80 wavelengths per fiber. Orange is one of
the world leaders in the use of advanced optical functions in order to
have a more flexible transmission network. For example, the first of
its kind worldwide, it deployed a 400 Gbits/s per wavelength optical
link between Paris and Lyon in 2013.

Orange / 2016 Registration Document

Furthermore, Orange offers direct connections by fiber optic to business
customers, providing them with very high-speed broadband services.

WidE Long-distance Domestic Optical Network
(WELDON) in France

Rollout of the WELDON network (WidE Long distance Domestic
Optical Network) began in April 2012 and aims to upgrade the entire
existing long-distance network, while extending its scope to serve
Frankfurt, London, Barcelona and Madrid to submarine cable stations,
and other areas neighboring France as needed in future.

WELDON uses the latest WDM technology and offers enhanced
connectivity at speeds of at least 100 Gbits/s per wavelength and up
to 88 wavelengths per cable.

International transmission network

This international network is based on two networks connected to the
WELDON network: the North-American backbone served by the two
arms of the TAT-14 transatlantic cable system and the Asian backbone
in Singapore served by the SEA-ME-WE3 and SEA-ME-WE4
submarine cables.

Satellites

Satellite communications are used by Orange to support global
network connections for the French overseas territories, IP or voice
connectivity with other carriers, and VSAT (Very Small Aperture
Terminal) services for Orange Business Services’ terrestrial or maritime
business customers. To provide those services, Orange purchases
space segment from satellite operators (such as Eutelsat, Intelsat,
SES and Arabsat).

Submarine cables

In order to accommodate the increase in international telecom-
munications traffic, Orange has invested in a number of submarine
cables through:

= participation in a consortium to build a cable that Orange will co-own;

= purchase of usage rights or transmission capacity leasing on other
cables.

As with terrestrial networks, higher speeds systems on submarine
cables are being implemented and 40 Gbits/s then 100 Gbit/s systems
are already operational on several cables within the Orange group.

The migration to 100 Gbits/s technology on the SEA-ME-WES and
SEA-ME-WE4 cables completed in 2015 enables Orange to support
growth in traffic on the Europe-Asia route.

In the longer term, Orange is participating in SEA-ME-WES, a cable
linking Singapore to Europe, with connectivity towards the Indian
Ocean, which became operational at the end of 2016. Also built using
100 Gbits/s technology, it significantly increases Orange's capacity on
the Asia-Europe route and provides new connectivity towards the
Indian Ocean via Djibouti to improve speeds to Reunion and Mayotte,
while preparing the switch from the older SEA-MEA-WEA3 and SEA-
MEA-WE4.

Working as part of a consortium, Orange commissioned the first
phase of the ACE (Africa Coast to Europe) cable in December 2012.
Around 17,000 kilometers long, its potential capacity will reach
5.12 Thits/s thanks to the use of 40 Gbits/s transmission technology.
ACE currently extends from France to Gabon and Sao Tomé and
Principe. The extension work to South Africa started at the end of
2015 and is scheduled to become operational in early 2018.

At the same time, in order to guarantee the security of its traffic by
diversifying its routes, Orange’s capacity on the SA8T3-WASC-SAFE,
cable was increased in 2014.

Orange is a co-owner of the LION (Lower Indian Ocean Network)
cables connecting Madagascar to the global broadband network via
Reunion and Mauritius, and LION2, the LION extension to Kenya
serving Mayotte. To meet the sustained growth in traffic, the Group.
has repeatedly invested in a capacity upgrade of both LION and
LION2, the most recent of which was operational at the end of 2015.
Orange decided to co-invest in a new cable for Mayotte, with a view
to commissioning it in 2018.

Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean/Guyana

Orange is also active in the Caribbean, where it has capacity on three
major cables: Americas-ll, ECFS, and CBUS. The Group took part in
capacity increases on these three cables to support the surge in
broadband use in France’s overseas departments. The additional
capacity was delivered in 2015.

3.2.1.5 IP transport networks
National IP networks

In each country in which it provides consumer services, Orange
operates a national IP network, supporting voice and data traffic, for
fixed, mobile, enterprise and wholesale services.

The international IP network

Orange international IP Transit network, known as Open Transit
Internet (OTI), aims to provide global Internet connectivity to Group
subsidiaries’ domestic IP networks, operator customers, Internet
Service Providers (ISP) and content providers. It is based on the latest
IP transmission and switching technologies.

As of end-2016, the OTI connected 24 cities (12 in Europe, two in
Asia, eight in North America and one in the Middle-East) through
broadband connections at speeds of 155 Mbits/s to 100 Gbits/s, with
several hundred Gbits/s of traffic at peak times. At the end of 2016,
the traffic hit 5 Thits.

The Multiservice IP eXchange
The IMN network (Multiservice IP network) is a dedicated network,
using the IPXGSMA IR.34 standard, tasked with transporting sensitive

and high value-added data of mobile operators, as well as
transporting Orange's International VoIP traffic.



--- Page 76 ---

3.2.1.6 Service support networks
and network control layer

The national service control networks
Fixed-line voice network

In the countries in which it has fixed-line operations, Orange operates
a switched telephone network (STN) to deliver analog voice and ISDN
digital services. These networks are continually being optimized
because of declining usage.

Orange also rolled out fixed-line VoIP networks using IMS technology
(IP Multimedia Subsystem) in many countries for residential and
business uses.

Mobile voice network

Until 2015, all mobile voice traffic was managed in switch mode by
the mobile network in each country. In 2015 and 2016, Orange rolled
out mobile IMS infrastructure in Europe to offer VoLTE services (VoIP
over LTE) and WiFi calling (mobile Voice over WiFi). The first
commercial application of this technology was in Romania, with the
launch of VoLTE in September 2015 and 2016. Other VoLTE and
VoWifi commercial launches followed in 2015 and 2016. At the end
of 2016, VoLTE and/or VoWifi services were commercially available in
several European Countries: France, Spain, Poland and Romania.

The International voice network
Voice network

Orange has three international switching nodes in France (CTI 4G) to
manage traffic to and from France in the fixed-line and mobile markets
(TDM) for consumers, businesses and operators, and to centralize the
transfer of international traffic for its subsidiaries. These exchanges
have developed into hybrid NGN nodes to carry Voice over IP (VoIP)
traffic. The architecture of the international voice network underwent
a major change in 2013 with the installation of four SBC softswitches
(Session Border Controllers) with routing functionality dedicated to
Voice over IP (VoIP). In December 2016, over 80% of VoIP traffic was.
fully supported by this new infrastructure. The CTI4G will remain in
place to manage the decline in TDM.

Orange has two softswitches in the United States and a media
gateway in Hong Kong to manage in TDM or VoIP mode customers.
and operators from the Americas and Asia.

Signaling network

The Signaling System 7 (SS7) of the international networks is provided
by two Signal Transfer Points (PTS), which support the signaling
associated with voice traffic, roaming and SMS of 2G and 3G mobile
operators. A growing number of links serving roaming and SMS.
customers are supported by SIGTRAN signaling over IP.

With the arrival of 4G (LTE) networks, the signaling used for
international roaming is supported by IP (Diameter-type routers). Two
DRF (Diameter Router Function) have been added to the international
network for the roaming traffic of Orange subsidiaries and non-Group
customers.

Several centralized platforms have been rolled out on the international
transit points to provide value-added services to mobile operators.

3.2.1.7. Networks dedicated to Enterprise
services

X.25 Networks

X.25 was taken off the market in mid-2010 and the technical aspects
of the service were discontinued in June 2012. X.25 still supports one
customer in France and its overseas territories, for backup payment
points, connected with “intelligent network” services.

Overview of the Group’s business
Network and real estate

The migration of this last customer into an IP network will be
completed by the end of the first quarter 2017. As at this date, X.25
will be permanently closed.

Frame Relay/ATM Networks

In France, the activity on the FR/ATM network is declining, and
businesses’ need for increased speed is increasingly met by the
IP/MPLS services available on the Network for Business Access to IP
(RAEI). A FR/ATM network optimization program was launched.

However, the Frame Relay/ATM network is maintained as a network
to access enterprise services via the TDSL (Turbo Digital Subscriber
Line) aggregation offers. Therefore, this network maintains points of
presence in France, in the five overseas departments and in two
overseas territories (New Caledonia and French Polynesia) to assist
in transiting the TDSL aggregation to GE (Gigabit Ethernet)
aggregation as part of the All-IP program.

The Network for Business Access to IP (RAEI) in France

The main purpose of the RAEI is to connect a company’s sites for
internal data exchange on the Virtual Private Network (VPN) and to
provide it with Internet connectivity. It also provides Voice over IP
transport for companies.

It is made up of a core infrastructure of around 60 transit routers that
are interconnected by multiple 10 Gbits/s links, or 100 Gbits/s links.

On this backbone all components and routers with network functions.
are connected, which also provide the interconnection with the
Backbone and IP Aggregation Network (RBC) for Internet traffic and
for business aggregation traffic coming from NAS and BAS.

The ring of approximately 900 PE (Provider Edge) routers gives
companies access to xDSL and Ethernet technologies, at speeds of
75 Kbits/s to 10 Gbits/s, under standard offers. The routers are
located in major cities and business areas.

This network is connected to the IP Global Network through four
gateways (located in Paris, Lille and Lyon) to connect international
business customers.

The international MPLS/IP VPN network
(IP Global Network IGN and AGN access network)

Like the IP network in France (RAEI), this network is designed to
supply Virtual Private Network (VPN), Internet and Voice over IP.
services. At the end of November 2016, the network comprised
633 points of presence (including partner MPLS networks) across
110 countries. Direct presence in the countries decreased (141 countries
in 2015) as Orange is developing a partnership strategy (Network to
Network Interface or NNI) in order to cover certain regions and
countries more effectively. 93 additional countries are covered by such
partnerships.

To strengthen an “all-IP” network (IGN+), a service virtualization
program was initiated in 2016 with the SDN-NFV project rolled out in
six points of presence outside France (two in Europe, two in North
America, two in Asia).

The international business voice network (NEO)

NEO is a network supplying voice services for international businesses.
Based on the international MPLS IP network (IGN), this business voice
network has approximately 70 points of presence in 38 countries, and
is connected to some 60 operators worldwide.

In 2016, a new network architecture was implemented for SIP
protocol interconnection in six new points of presence.

3.2.2 Real estate

At December 31, 2016, the real estate assets recorded in Orange's
balance sheet had a net carrying value of 2.7 billion euros, compared
with 2.7 billion euros in 2015.

The buildings are very varied in terms of sizes and destinations: if
some service campuses such as Orange Gardens in France, which
was inaugurated on June 8, 2016, have surface areas of more than
50,000 sq.m. for thousands of employees, many small technical
kiosks have a very small floor surface area and are not occupied.

At end-2016, Orange occupied 25,327 sites (including 217 with a
surface area greater than 5,000 sq.m.), covering a total area of
5.6 million sq.m. including 2.2 million sq.m. of leased space and
3.5 million sq.m. of fully-owned space.

In France, more than 82% of the technical buildings are fully-owned
while service buildings are close to 58% rented.

The Real Estate Division manages all properties in France, whether
they are office buildings, technical buildings or points of sale.

It pursues a real estate investment optimization policy by addressing
the needs related both to the telecommunications network's evolution
and the implementation of innovative working environments. Buildings
are always conceived in terms of their uses and as a service.

Many points of sale within the distribution network were upgraded to
the “Smart Store” concept. The Paris Opéra store, which was opened
on November 8, 2016, is the Group's iconic front-window in its new
customer experience approach.

In accordance with the principles of the Essentials2020 plan, the Real
Estate Division is actively involved in improving the workspaces of
Group employees as well as in the environmental transition goals by
improving the environmental quality of the building stock.

In Poland, the properties held by Orange Poland at the end of 2016
represented 1.7 million sq.m. The total surface area of developed and
undeveloped land represented 12.8 million sq.m.

3.3.1. Research and innovation

In order to achieve its goals in research and innovation, Orange has
established a network of expertise spanning four continents.

The Orange Labs, which carry out the Group's technical research,
design and deployment activities, are located in eight countries around
the world: France, China, Japan, Poland, Romania, Tunisia, India and
Egypt. Each Orange Lab is immersed in a specific environment that
enables it to anticipate and take advantage of technological
breakthroughs and changes in user patterns worldwide and to
facilitate partnerships, thereby accelerating the Group's capacity for
innovation.

The Orange Labs network is supplemented by so-called Technocentres,
located in France, the United Kingdom, Jordan and Ivory Coast. Their
objective is to design and market new products and services that
meet customer requirements as far as possible in all the countries
where the Group is present. They are also tasked with ensuring
consistent user interfaces for the Group's various products and
services (design strategy).

In response to new waves of technology and helping to create the
applications of the future, Orange group's research covers nine areas:

3.3.2 Open Innovation

More than ever, Open Innovation is a crucial strategy for research and
innovation to capture trends and benefit from partners’ skills in a
balanced and win-win mode. This also makes it possible to draw on
ecosystems that promote long-term growth.

The main modalities are as follows:

= supporting start-ups and SMEs. Orange has launched a network
of start-up accelerators known as Orange Fab, with a presence in
12 countries across four continents. Created in March 2013 in
Silicon Valley, the Orange Fab program was rolled out internationally
that same year in France, and then in 2014 in Japan (followed by
South Korea and Taiwan), Poland, Ivory Coast, Israel and Jordan.
The Orange Fab network was extended to Spain in 2015 and to
Senegal and Cameroon in 2016. Orange helps selected start-ups
grow their businesses, and in certain countries also provides
financial and logistical support. Over 220 start-ups were or are
being accelerated by Orange Fab as at end-2016. In order to foster
the growth of these start-ups, Orange and Deutsche Telekom
announced (in June 2014) their collaboration on their respective
Orange Fab and hub:raum acceleration programs. To address the
increasing international ambitions of start-ups, in September 2015
Orange created the alliance Go Ignite with Deutsche Telecom,
Singtel and Telefonica. The selected start-ups can have access to
the resources and markets of these partners, representing over
a billion potential clients, with complementary locations in Europe,
Africa, Latin America, South Eastern Asia and the Middle East, thus
contributing to the emergence of new European or even global
leaders. Ultimately, France Orange is an active player in the French
