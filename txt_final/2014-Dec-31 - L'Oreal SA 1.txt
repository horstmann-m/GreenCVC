3 KEY FIGURES AND COMMENTS ON THE 2014 FINANCIAL YEAR
THE GROUP’S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN 2014

— ~—

In 2014, in a volatile economic context and a less dynamic market,
the Group posted growth in all its Divisions and regions of the world.

L’Oréal Luxe and Active Cosmetics achieved very good growth and
outperformed their market significantly. The Professional Products
Division continued to improve. Meanwhile, in a slowing market, the
Consumer Products Division saw a temporary sag in its growth,
particularly in the United States.

2014 was also a year of transformation for L’Oréal, in particular
through the acceleration of our digital transformation and strategic
acquisitions such as Magic, NYX, Decléor, Carita and Niely®,
which complement our brand portfolio in key categories and regions
of the world.

Despite adverse currency effects, operating margin increased once
again in 2014 highlighting the strength of the business model of
L'Oréal. Following the capital gain realised upon the disposal of

Galderma as part of the strategic transaction with Nestlé,
net profit has grown strongly.

brands are growing - benefits from the dynamism of Majirel

with the launch of its new “Makeup Designer” platform and
Miss Manga mascara. Ultra Doux by Garnier is continuing to
expand thanks to its Honey Treasures range and the
brand’s successful United Kingdom launch. In Southern

with the success of Sakura White and Garnier Men.

worldwide, and is now growing again in the United States
with the launch of the Nudes Palette.

strongly.

ACTIVE COSMETICS

In 2014, the Division accelerated its growth, with sales
advancing by +8.7% like-for-like and +5.3% based on
reported figures, outperforming a healthy market.
Like-for-like growth rates were higher than in 2013 on every

particularly Liffactiv Supreme and Neovadiol in the
anti-ageing segment. With another year of double-digit
growth, La Roche-Posay is maintaining its growth in all
regions and across its product range, with outstanding
performances from its two pillar ranges, Anthelios and
Effaclar. SkinCeuticals is confirming its success both in its
original market, the United States, and in the new
geographies where it is expanding.

¢ All the regions are contributing to the Division’s dynamism.
The significant scores in France, the world’s largest
dermocosmetics market, Brazil, where the Division is
contributing to the development of the market, and China
are particularly worth noting.

MULTI-DIVISION SUMMARY BY GEOGRAPHIC ZONE

Western Europe

In a flat market, and a highly competitive environment
between mass-market retailers, growth came out at +2.4%
like-for-like and +3.1% based on reported figures. This increase
is particularly encouraging because L'Oréal accelerated in the
fourth quarter, and is growing both in Northern and Southern
Europe, particularly in Germany, the United Kingdom and
Spain. All Divisions are contributing to the sales increase, with a
special mention for L’Oréal Luxe and Active Cosmetics.

North America

After a strong momentum over the last few years, growth in
2014 was more moderate because of the Consumer Products
Division. Sales increased by +1.1% like-for-like and +0.6% based
on reported figures. The Professional Products Division, Active
Cosmetics and L’Oréal Luxe are continuing to develop, thanks,
among others, to the American brands Redken, SkinCeuticals,

Urban Decay and Kiehl's. In a market that improved in the

Division, and boost its product offering.

Brazil

-6.3% based on reported figures, and is growing significantly
faster than the market, thanks to the good momentum of
L’Oréal Luxe and the Professional Products Division. The

share with a very good performance in hair colour, driven
by the launch of Prodigy by L’Oréal Paris, and in deodorants
thanks to Néo by Gamier. Active Cosmetics is
outperforming the market in Russia and Turkey.
