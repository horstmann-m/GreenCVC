1 SUMMARY OF THE GROUP'S RESULTS

Income statement and cash flow statement data for the year ended December 31, 2016 have been restated following the
classification of ENGIE E&P International as "Discontinued operations" as of May 11, 2017 (see Note 4.1.1 "Disposal of
the exploration-production business" to the consolidated financial statements). A reconciliation of the reported data with
the restated comparative data is presented in Note 30 "Restatement of 2016 comparative data" to the consolidated financial
statements.

ENGIE delivered robust results and strong organic growth in 2017, driven notably by the positive impacts of the Lean 2018
performance program.

Revenues increased by 0.3% on a reported basis to €65.0 billion and by 1.7% on an organic basis compared with 2016.
Reported growth was affected by changes in the scope of consolidation (€583 million negative impact) due mainly to the
disposal of the merchant power generation assets in the United States, Poland and the United Kingdom. This was partially
offset by the acquisition of Keepmoat Regeneration which designs, builds, refurbishes and regenerates residential
buildings, and a negative foreign exchange effect of €300 million, chiefly related to fluctuations in the pound sterling.
Organic revenue growth was driven by an increase in volumes and prices on commodities sold in the gas midstream
business in Europe and LNG business in Asia, an improved performance by the thermal power generation plants in Europe
and Australia, the impact of new assets commissioned and price rises in Latin America, and the impact of the 2016 price
revisions in the infrastructure business in France. These positive developments were partially offset by a fall in sales of
natural gas to business customers in France and by a decrease in hydro renewable energy generation in France.

EBITDA amounted to €9.3 billion, down 1.8% on a reported basis but up a sharp 5.3% on an organic basis. The reported
fall was due to changes in the scope of consolidation (€677 million negative impact), due mainly to the disposal of the
merchant power generation assets in the United States in June 2016 and February 2017 and the disposal of Paiton in
Indonesia at end-2016, coupled with the recognition in EBITDA as of 2017 of the nuclear contribution in Belgium
(€142 million negative impact). These negative impacts were partially offset by a positive foreign exchange effect related
notably to the Brazilian real. The organic growth in EBITDA was driven by revenue-related developments (excluding the
gas midstream and LNG businesses), plus the impacts of the Lean 2018 performance program. This reflects the positive
performance from the Group's growth drivers (5.0%), namely the contracted renewable and thermal power generation,
infrastructure and customer-service solutions businesses.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method decreased
by 6.4% on a reported basis and increased by 5.0% on an organic basis to €5.3 billion. The organic growth in EBITDA was
mitigated by higher depreciation expense following the increase of Belgian nuclear power plant dismantling provisions
recognized at end-2016 against an asset.

Net income Group share relating to continued operations amounted to €1.2 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2017, representing a significant improvement on 2016. This improvement takes into account (i) lower
impairment losses (net of tax), (ii) gains on the disposal of the thermal merchant power plant assets in the United States,
Poland and the United Kingdom, as well as on the disposal of a non-consolidated interest in Petronet LNG in India and the
residual interest in NuGen in the United Kingdom, and (iii) a reduction in the cost of debt and current income taxes. These
items were partially offset by (i) the negative impacts of fair value adjustments to hedges of commodity purchases and
sales, (ii) charges to restructuring provisions, and (iii) the initial non-recurring accounting impact relating to the change in
the accounting treatment of long-term gas supply contracts, a power exchange contract as well as to the identification of
a series of transport and storage capacities contracts corresponding to onerous contracts, as a result of a change in their
management environment.

Net income Group share amounted to €1.4 billion for 2017. It includes €0.2 billion of net income Group share from
ENGIE E&P International activities classified as "Discontinued operations".

Net recurring income Group share relating to continued operations amounted to €2.4 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2017, down 2.4% compared with 2016. The fall in current operating income after share in net income of
companies accounted for using the equity method was partially offset by an improvement in recurring net financial
income/(loss) and tax income/(loss).

MANAGEMENT REPORT
1 SUMMARY OF THE GROUP'S RESULTS

Net recurring income Group share amounted to €2.7 billion, showing an improvement compared with the previous year.
It includes €0.3 billion of net recurring income Group share from ENGIE E&P International activities classified as
"Discontinued operations".

Cash flow from operations amounted to a sound €8.3 billion, representing a €1.3 billion decline, however, compared with
2016. This performance reflected the negative impact of changes in the scope of consolidation, higher restructuring and
dispute settlement costs, and a less favorable change in working capital due mainly to gas inventories in France.

Net debt stood at €22.5 billion, down €2.3 billion compared with December 31, 2016, mainly due to (i) cash flow from
operations (€8.3 billion), (ii) the impacts of the portfolio rotation program (€4.8 billion), including the completion of the
disposal of the thermal merchant power plant portfolio in the United States, Poland and the United Kingdom, the disposal
of interests in Opus Energy and NuGen in the United Kingdom, the classification of the Loy Yang B coal-fired power plant
in Australia under "Assets held for sale", the disposal of a 25% interest in Elengy (through the transfer of 100% of Elengy
to GRTgaz) and the disposal of an interest in Petronet LNG in India, and (iii) a favorable exchange rate effect (€0.7 billion).
These items were partially offset by (i) gross investments in the period (€9.3 billion), and (ii) dividends paid to ENGIE SA
shareholders (€2.0 billion) and to non-controlling interests (€0.6 billion). Net debt also improved thanks to the impact of the
recovery from the French State of the 3% tax on dividends (€0.4 billion).

2 OUTLOOK

2 OUTLOOK

Since 2016, the Group is committed to a 3 year transformation plan aiming at creating value and at improving the
Group’s risk profile. This plan is based on 3 main programs:

e the portfolio rotation program (€15 billion net debt impact targeted over 2016-2018). The Group has announced
to date €13.2 billion of disposals (i.e. more than 90% of total program), of which €11.6 billion already closed “’;

e the investment program (€14.3 billion ® growth capex over 2016-2018). The Group has announced to have
invested and secured €13.9 billion (i.e. more than 97% of total program) of which €10.2 billion have been
closed;

e the Lean 2018 performance plan. The Group decided to raise its 2018 target by €100 million, for a total of
€1.3 billion of net gains expected at the EBITDA level by 2018. At end December 2017, €947 million of cumulated
net gains were recorded at the EBITDA level, which is higher than the initial cumulated target of €850 million. The
entire revised program has already been identified.

For 2018, the Group anticipates a net recurring income Group share excluding E&P and LNG between €2.45 and
€2.65 billion ©, in strong organic growth compared to 2017. This guidance is based on an indicative range for EBITDA
of €9.3 to 9.7 billion, also growing strongly organically.

For the 2018 period, the Group anticipates:

e anet debt/EBITDA ratio below or equal to 2.5x; and
e an «Ay» category credit rating.

For fiscal year 2017, the Group confirms the payment of a €0.70 per share dividend, payable in cash.

For fiscal year 2018, the Group announces a new dividend policy, with a dividend increased to €0.75 per share (+7.1%)
payable in cash.

(1) In November 2017, ENGIE announced it had signed with Total an agreement for the sale of its upstream and midstream Liquefied
Natural Gas (LNG) activities, that should be closed during 2018. In 2018, ENGIE closed the disposal of the E&P International activity
and of Loy Yang B coal-fired power plant in Australia.

(2) Net of DBSO proceeds; excluding Capex related to E&P and upstream / midstream LNG (including Touat and Cameron) for €0.3 billion
and Corporate Capex for €0.2 billion.

(3) These targets and this indication, excluding E&P and LNG contributions, assume average weather conditions in France, full pass
through of supply costs in French regulated gas tariffs, no significant accounting changes except for IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, no major
regulatory and macro-economic changes, commodity price assumptions based on market conditions as of December 31, 2017 for the
non-hedged part of the production, and average foreign exchange rates as follows for 2018: €/$: 1.22; €/BRL: 3.89, and without
significant impacts from disposals not already announced.

(1) Comparative data at December 31, 2016 have been restated due to the classification of ENGIE E&P International under
“Discontinued operations” on May 11, 2017 (see Note 30 “Restatement of 2016 comparative data’).

Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to €65.0 billion, up 0.3% compared with the
previous year. On an organic basis (excluding changes in the scope of consolidation and foreign exchange impacts),
revenues grew by 1.7%. Adjusted for the adverse trend in temperatures in France, which were milder than in 2016, organic
growth was 1.9%.

Changes in the scope of consolidation had a net negative impact of €583 million, arising mainly from the disposal of hydro
and thermal merchant power generation assets in the United States (€836 million negative impact), Poland (€440 million
negative impact) and the United Kingdom (€93 million negative impact), partially offset by the acquisition of Keepmoat
Regeneration (€473 million positive impact). Exchange rates had a negative €300 million impact on revenues, mainly
reflecting the depreciation of the pound sterling against the euro.

Organic revenue growth was driven by an increase in commodity volumes sold in the midstream business in Europe, an
improved performance by the thermal power generation plants in Europe and Australia, the impact of new assets
commissioned and price rises in Latin America, and the impact of the 2016 price revisions in the regulated infrastructure
business in France. These positive developments were partially offset by a fall in sales of natural gas to business customers
in France and by a decrease in hydro renewable energy generation in France.

Organic revenues by segment were (i) up in GEM & LNG, Latin America, Infrastructures Europe, Europe excluding France
and Benelux, and Africa/Asia, (ii) stable in France, (iii) down slightly in North America and Benelux, and (iv) down
significantly in the Other segment.

EBITDA declined by 1.8% to €9.3 billion over the year. Excluding the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and
exchange rates, EBITDA increased by 5.3%.

Changes in the scope of consolidation had a negative impact of €677 million due mainly to the disposal of hydro and
thermal merchant power generation assets in the United States (€329 million negative impact) and Paiton in Indonesia
(€156 million negative impact), coupled with the recognition in EBITDA as of 2017 of the nuclear contribution in Belgium
(€142 million negative impact). Exchange rates had a positive €26 million impact, mainly due to the appreciation of the
Brazilian real against the euro.

On an organic basis, EBITDA was up 5.3% to €477 million. The increase reflects the positive performance from the Group's
growth drivers “ which benefitted from (i) the Lean 2018 performance program, (ii) the commissioning of new assets
notably in Latin America, and (iii) a good performance from the customer solution business particularly thanks to the
development of services. These positive factors were partially offset by (i) the impact of a provision reversal in Brazil in
2016, (ii) the strong decrease in hydro renewable energy generation volumes in France, and (iii) an adverse temperature
effect in the gas infrastructure and retail businesses in France. Furthermore, the performance in merchant activities was
stable over the period as positive price and volume effects in thermal power generation activities in Europe and Australia
were offset by the decrease in captured prices and in the nuclear power generation activity, particularly in Belgium.

Organic EBITDA performance varied significantly between segments:

e in North America, organic EBITDA was up sharply thanks to a good performance from the services businesses
coupled with cost savings under the Lean 2018 program, despite a weaker performance from the remaining power
generation activities;

e in Latin America, organic EBITDA contracted slightly, mainly due to the positive impact of a provision reversal in
2016 in Brazil, partially offset by the commissioning of new assets in Mexico and Peru, positive price revisions in
Mexico and Argentina, and an improvement in the contribution of hydroelectric power activities in Brazil;

in Africa/Asia, organic EBITDA reflects a very strong performance as growth drivers benefitted mainly from the
commissioning of the Az-Zour North power plant in Kuwait and the successful closing of the Fadhili power plant
contract in Saudi Arabia, the solid performance of retail businesses notably in Australia, and from higher margins
in the gas distribution business in Thailand. These factors were partially offset by lower availability of assets in
Thailand and Turkey and higher taxes for entities accounted for using the equity method in Oman and Saudi
Arabia. Moreover, regarding merchant activities, the power generation business in Australia benefitted from the
increase in prices and volumes;

in Benelux, the organic decrease in EBITDA was mainly due to merchant activities as the nuclear power generation
business was impacted by a decline in captured electricity sale prices and the non-scheduled shutdown of Tihange
1, Tihange 2 and Doel 3. These impacts were partially offset by a good performance in growth drivers from the
service, gas and electricity sales businesses, and renewable power generation businesses, as well as cost savings
under the Lean 2018 program;

in France, the improvement in EBITDA, relating to the renewable power and customer-service solution businesses,
was due to higher electricity volumes in the retail segment, margins from DBSO “ activities (in the wind and solar
farms sectors) and a good performance from the network business. These impacts were partially offset by a
decrease in hydro energy generation, lower volumes and margins in the retail gas business, as well as an adverse
temperature effect in France;

EBITDA trends in Europe excluding France & Benelux reflect the strong performance from growth drivers. This is
mainly due to an improvement in margins and volumes in the gas and electricity retail businesses in the United
Kingdom, the gas services and distribution businesses, and cost savings under the Lean 2018 performance
program;

in Infrastructures Europe, the organic decrease in EBITDA stemmed from lower storage capacity sales in France,
the negative impact of price revisions in the transport business and the adverse trend in temperatures in France;

in GEM & GNL, EBITDA was down compared with 2016, mainly in merchant activities due to negative price
impacts, less significant revisions to gas supply conditions in 2017 than in 2016 and gas supply difficulties in the
south of France in January 2017 during the cold spell. These negative impacts were partially offset by price
revisions to LNG supply contracts entered into in 2017, coupled with cost savings under the Lean 2018
performance program;

in the Other segment, strong organic growth in EBITDA was driven mainly by a good performance from gas fired
thermal power generation in Europe (merchant activity) and from BtoB electricity sales in France (customer-service
solutions). Moreover, EBITDA benefitted from cost savings under the Lean 2018 program, notably at corporate
level.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method amounted to
€5.3 billion, up 5.0% on an organic basis compared with 2016, for the same reasons as those given above for EBITDA.
Depreciation expense for the year was higher than the previous year following the three-yearly review of Belgian nuclear
power plant dismantling costs at end-2016.

Revenues for the North America segment totalled €2,934 million, down 23.1% on a reported basis primarily due to the
disposal in the merchant generation fleet. Revenues were down 1.8% on an organic basis, driven by a contraction in supply
business and less favorable PPA renewals on the remaining fleet. This was partly mitigated by higher services revenues.

Electricity sales decreased from 65.8 TWh to 41.3 TWh primarily as a consequence of the disposal of the merchant assets.

EBITDA totalled €169 million, down 64.3% on a reported basis and up 18.3% organically. The organic improvement
resulted from a stronger performance by the services businesses combined with corporate cost savings. These impacts
were partially offset by the weaker performance of the remaining fleet.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method amounted to
€120 million, down 72.2% on a reported basis but up 23.6% on an organic basis, due to the movements in EBITDA

Revenues for the Latin America segment totalled €4,511 million, representing a 10.7% increase on a reported basis
benefiting from the appreciation of the Brazilian real as well as from an 8.3% organic increase.

In Brazil, revenues increased thanks to the commissioning of the Santa Monica wind complex and higher prices, partly
driven by poor hydrology. In Mexico, revenues benefited from a distribution tariff increase and the commissioning of the
Panuco (gas power plant) in October 2016. Chile was positively impacted by power price indexation (despite lower
volumes) and higher demand for regasification. Argentina benefited from distribution tariff increases in October 2016 and
in April and December 2017. In Peru, the commissioning of ChilcaPlus (May 2016) and Nodo Energetico (October 2016)
helped to offset the lower demand and the loss of PPAs with high margins.

Electricity sales remained stable at 59.3 TWh, while gas sales decreased by 1.6 TWh to 28.9 TWh.

EBITDA totalled €1,711 million, up 0.9% on a reported basis, positively impacted by the appreciation of the Brazilian real
and down 2.4% on an organic basis. The slight organic decrease is due to a significant one-off 2016 provision reversal in
Brazil, partially offset by the factors mentioned for revenue, as well as better overall results in the spot market in Brazil, the

Revenues for the Africa/Asia segment totalled €3,984 million, up 4.7% on a reported basis and 6.5% organically. The
contribution of the services activities of an Australian company acquired in 2016 was partially offset by a negative foreign
exchange effect due to the weakening of the US dollar against the euro and the sale of the Meenakshi coal-fired power
plant in India in September 2016. The organic increase resulted mainly from higher market prices in Australia, which
positively impacted the generation fleet, and from higher sales volumes in the Australian retail business and the successful
closing of the Fadhili power plant contract in Saudi Arabia. These positive impacts were partially offset by major
maintenance planned in Thailand, lower power plant availability and a decrease in gas prices in Turkey.

Electricity sales decreased by 6.1 TWh to 44.9 TWh, mainly due to the closure of the Hazelwood coal-fired power plant in
Australia at the end of the first quarter and to the sale of the Meenakshi power plant.

EBITDA totalled €1,323 million, up 13.8% on a reported basis, mainly due to the positive impact of the Tabreed (district
cooling networks) acquisition in the United Arab Emirates in September 2017, offsetting the sale of the Paiton coal-fired
power plant in December 2016. The 30.5% organic increase mainly reflects the improved performance of the generation
and retail businesses in Australia, higher margins for gas distributor PTT NGD in Thailand, the commissioning of the
Az-Zour North power plant in Kuwait, the impact of the successful closing of the Fadhili contract in Saudi Arabia and the
positive settlement of claims in the Middle East. This performance was partially offset by lower power plant availability in
Thailand and Turkey, and the impact of tax increases on the results of our associates in Oman and Saudi Arabia.

reflects a fall in volumes sold in the BtoB segment in Belgium and the impact of lower commodity prices on the retail
business. The services businesses, supported by buoyant performances in Belgium, delivered 5.1% revenue growth.

In Belgium and Luxembourg, electricity sales totalled 37.9 TWh, down 0.9 TWh on 2016. In the Netherlands, electricity
sales amounted to 9.8 TWh, representing an increase of 1.4 TWh.

Natural gas sales rose by 0.2 TWh to 49.4 TWh at December 31, 2017.

EBITDA amounted to €551 million, down 8.2% on an organic basis compared with 2016, due to a decline in captured
electricity sale prices and the lower availability of nuclear power plants following the non-scheduled shutdown of Tihange 1,
Tihange 2 and Doel 3. These impacts were partially offset by a good performance from the services businesses and gas
and electricity sales activities, coupled with cost savings under the Lean 2018 program. Apart from the above-mentioned
factors driving the decrease, the 26.9% decline in reported EBITDA was also impacted by the recognition of the nuclear
contribution in EBITDA as of January 1, 2017. The contribution for the year amounted to €142 million.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method fell in line
with EBITDA and was also adversely affected by an increase in depreciation expense resulting from an increase in the
amount of dismantling assets recognized at end-2016 following the three-yearly review of nuclear provisions.

Revenues for the France segment totalled €16,659 million, down 18.1% on a reported basis and up 0.1% on an organic
basis. The reported fall was due to the transfer of the BtoB gas and electricity sales activity (E&C) from the France segment
to the Other segment. The slight organic increase resulted from higher revenues from the services businesses, offset by
lower hydro power generation.

Natural gas sales excluding the transfer of E&C fell by 7.9 TWh, including 6.0 TWh following the loss of retail customers
due to competitive pressure and 1.9 TWh related to the temperature effect. Electricity sales excluding the transfer of E&C
inched up 0.1 TWh, chiefly due to the increase in electricity volumes sold in the retail segment, which was offset by the
decrease in hydro power generation.

Revenues for the Europe excluding France & Benelux segment totaled €8,848 million, representing organic growth of
4.0%, driven mainly by positive price and volume effects in the gas and electricity retail businesses in the United Kingdom
and growth in the services businesses. Besides this organic growth, the negative exchange rate impact on the pound
sterling was more than offset by the contribution of Keepmoat Regeneration, acquired in late April 2017, to revenues.

Electricity sales amounted to 30.3 TWh, representing an increase of 0.6 TWh ® compared with 2016. Gas sales increased
by 2.9 TWh to 71.1 TWh, notably driven by favorable weather conditions in Romania.

EBITDA totaled €655 million, representing an increase of 9.7% on an organic basis, mainly due to an improvement in
margins and volumes in the gas and electricity retail businesses in the United Kingdom, the services and gas distribution
businesses, and cost savings under the Lean 2018 performance program.

Revenues for the Infrastructures Europe segment, including intra-Group transactions, amounted to €6,712 million,
representing a slight 0.7% decline due, for France, to lower storage capacity sales, the annual revision of regasification
and transport infrastructure tariffs (4.6% increase on April 1, 2016 and 3.1% decrease on April 1, 2017), and the impact of
unfavorable temperatures on the gas distribution business, partially offset by short-term transport capacity sales in

Germany. The overall impact of revisions to distribution infrastructure tariffs in France was positive (2.8% increase on
July 1, 2016 and 2.05% decrease on July 1, 2017).

The contribution to Group revenues was €3,488 million, up 6.8% on 2016. The improved contribution essentially reflects
the growth in distribution and transport activities for third parties in France. Transport revenues were also on the rise in
Germany.

EBITDA amounted to €3,384 million, down 2.1% on the previous year, mainly reflecting the change in total revenues.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method came in at
€1,940 million for the period, down 6.2% on 2016, with a rise in net depreciation and amortization charges resulting from
the commissioning of new assets by GRTgaz (including Arc de Dierrey at end-2016) and GRDF (notably the new
communicating “smart” meters).

GEM & LNG's contribution to Group revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to €9,391 million, up
4.9% on an organic basis year on year. Growth was driven by an increase in the volumes and prices of commodities sold
in the midstream gas business in Europe and the LNG business in Asia.

EBITDA was a negative €82 million, down on 2016 due mainly to negative price effects, less significant revisions to gas
supply conditions in 2017 than in 2016 and gas supply difficulties in the south of France in January 2017. These impacts
were partially offset by the positive impact of an LNG supply contract prices revision in 2017, coupled with cost savings
under the Lean 2018 performance program.

The business incurred a current operating loss after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity
method of €137 million in 2017, representing a deterioration on both a reported and an organic basis, in line with EBITDA

The Other segment comprises the activities of the Generation Europe, Tractebel, GTT and Other business units, with the
Other business unit encompassing Solairedirect and the Group's holding and corporate activities, which notably include
the entities centralizing the Group's financing requirements and the equity-accounted contribution of SUEZ. As of
January 1, 2017, the Other segment also includes BtoB gas and electricity sales activities (E&C) in France, previously
accounted for in the France segment.

Revenues totalled €6,347 million, up 86% on a reported basis and down 9.4% on an organic basis. The reported increase
mainly reflects the internal transfer of the E&C business on January 1, 2017, partially offset by the disposal in 2017 of the
thermal power generation business in Poland and the United Kingdom. The organic decrease stemmed from a fall in
natural gas sales to business customers in France due to the loss of customers and from the shutdown of the Rugeley
power plant in the United Kingdom in June 2016, partially offset by an improved performance from gas-fired power plants
in Europe, particularly in France and Belgium, driven by an increase in captured electricity sale prices.

Natural gas sales fell by 9.2 TWh, comprising a negative 0.6 TWh temperature effect and a negative 8.6 TWh impact due
to competitive pressure. ENGIE's share of the BtoB market has fallen from 25% to 21% at end-2016. Electricity sales were
up 0.9 TWh to 46.1 TWh, benefiting from higher generation at gas-fired power plants in Europe and the continuous push
to gain market share for electricity in the BtoB segment in France. These improvements were partially offset by the disposal
of thermal assets in Poland in March 2017 and in the United Kingdom in October 2017, and the shutdown of the Rugeley
power plant in June 2016.

EBITDA totalled €128 million, up on both a reported and an organic basis compared with 2016, mainly due to a good
performance from the thermal power generation business in Europe following the increase in captured margins. Gains in
market share for electricity in the BtoB segment in France and improved risk management were partially offset by the loss
of gas market share.

Current operating loss after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method was a negative
€308 million for the period, representing an improvement on both a reported and an organic basis, in line with EBITDA.

“Discontinued operations” on May 11, 2017 (see Note 30 “Restatement of 2016 comparative data’).

Income from operating activities amounted to €2,819 million in 2017, representing an increase compared with 2016,
mainly due to (i) lower impairment losses in 2017, (ii) gains on asset disposals and available-for-sale securities, partially
offset by (iii) the negative impact of fair value adjustments to commodity hedges, (iv) the fall in current operating income
after share in net income of companies accounted for using the equity method, (v) higher restructuring costs, and (vi) the
initial non-recurring accounting impact relating to the change in the accounting treatment of long-term gas supply contracts,
a power exchange contract as well as to the identification of a series of transport and storage capacities contracts
corresponding to onerous contracts, as a result of new management environment (GEM business unit).

Income from operating activities was also affected by:

e changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives relating to operating items, which had a negative impact of
€307 million on income from operating activities (reflecting transactions not eligible for hedge accounting),
compared with a positive impact of €1,279 million in 2016. The impact for the period results chiefly from negative
overall price effects on these positions, combined with the net negative impact of unwinding positions with a
positive market value at December 31, 2016;

e net impairment losses of €1,317 million, compared with €4,035 million the previous year.

At December 31, 2017, the Group recognized net impairment losses of €481 million against goodwill, €788 million
against property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and €48 million against financial assets and
investments in entities accounted for using the equity method. These impairment losses related mainly to the
Infrastructures Europe (storage), Other (primarily the Generation Europe business unit), and the Africa/Asia,
France and North America reportable segments. After taking into account the deferred tax effects and the share
of impairment losses attributable to non-controlling interests, the impact of these impairment losses on net income
Group share was a negative €1,146 million. These impairment losses are described in Note 8.2 “Impairment
losses” to the consolidated financial statements.

In 2016, the Group recognized net impairment losses of €1,690 million against goodwill, €2,201 million against
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and €144 million against financial assets and investments in
entities accounted for using the equity method. These impairment losses related mainly to the Benelux,
GEM & LNG, France and North America reportable segments;

e — restructuring costs of €671 million (compared with €450 million the previous year), mainly including costs related
to the Lean 2018 performance program on the Group's corporate activities;

e changes in the scope of consolidation, which had a positive impact of €752 million, mainly including gains on the
disposal of the thermal merchant power plant portfolio in the United States for €540 million, the Group's entire
38.10% residual interest in NuGen for €93 million, a power plant portfolio in the United Kingdom for €61 million
and the Polaniec power plant in Poland for €57 million (see Note 4.1);

e other non-recurring items representing a loss of €911 million, mainly including (i) the initial non-recurring
accounting impact (negative 1,243 million) relating to the change in the accounting treatment of long-term gas
supply contracts, a power exchange contract as well as to the identification of a series of transport and storage
capacities contracts corresponding to onerous contracts, as a result of new management environment
(see Note 8.5), and (ii) the €349 million gain on the disposal of the Group's 10% interest in Petronet LNG in India.

The net financial loss was stable and amounted to €1,296 million in 2017, compared with €1,321 million the previous
year (see Note 9).

The income tax benefit for 2017 amounted to €425 million (€481 million expense in 2016). It includes an income tax
benefit of €1,531 million arising on non-recurring income statement items (versus €843 million in 2016), mainly relating to
(i) tax rate changes in France, in the United States and other non-recurring measures (€479 million), (ii) the impact of the
recovery from the French State of the 3% tax on dividends (€359 million) and (iii) to the initial non-recurring accounting
impact of the change in the accounting treatment of certain BU GEM contracts mentioned above (€298 million). Adjusted
for these non-recurring items, the effective recurring tax rate was 29.3%, lower than the 2016 rate of 36.1% notably due to
the recognition in EBITDA as of 2017 of the nuclear contribution in Belgium as well as to the repeal of the 3% tax on
dividends in France.

Net income relating to continued operations attributable to non-controlling interests amounted to €722 million,
compared with €626 million in 2016. The increase is due to improved operating income, particularly in Asia/Pacific, and to
reversals of impairment losses in the United Kingdom, whose impacts were mitigated by the recognition in 2016 of a capital
gain on the disposal of a 50% interest in Transmisora Eléctrica del Norte (TEN) in Chile.

6 CHANGES IN NET DEBT

Net debt stood at €22.5 billion, down €2.3 billion compared with December 31, 2016, mainly due to (i) cash flow from
operations (€8.3 billion), (ii) the impacts of the portfolio rotation program (€4.8 billion), including the completion of the
disposal of the thermal merchant power plant portfolio in the United States, Poland and the United Kingdom, the disposal
of an interest in Opus Energy and the residual interest in NuGen in the United Kingdom, the classification of the Loy Yang B
coal-fired power plant in Australia under "Assets held for sale", the disposal of a 25% interest in Elengy (through the transfer
of 100% of Elengy to GRTgaz) and the disposal of an interest in Petronet LNG in India, and (iii) a favorable exchange rate
effect (€0.7 billion). These items were partially offset by (i) gross investments in the period (€9.3 billion), and (ii) dividends
paid to ENGIE SA shareholders (€2.0 billion) and to non-controlling interests (€0.6 billion). Net debt also improved thanks
to the impact of the recovery from the French State of the 3% tax on dividends (€0.4 billion).

2016. This performance reflected negative changes in the scope of consolidation, higher restructuring and dispute
settlement costs, and a less favorable change in working capital due mainly to gas inventories in France.

6.2 Net investments

Gross investments during the period amounted to €9,267 million and included:

e financial investments for €3,487 million, relating notably to (i) the acquisition of a 40% interest in Tabreed in the
United Arab Emirates (€657 million), Keepmoat Regeneration in the United Kingdom (€392 million) and Icomera
in Sweden (€119 million), (ii) the concession agreements won for the Jaguara and Miranda hydro power plants in

(€135 million) and the joint venture in charge of the 50-year energy management contract with the University of
Ohio in the United States (€125 million), (iv) the financing of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project (€298 million), and
(v) a €78 million increase in Synatom investments;

e development investments totaling €3,309 million, including (i) €1,294 million invested in the Latin America segment
to build thermal power plants and develop hydro power plants, as well as wind and photovoltaic farms, in Brazil

the natural gas transportation network in France), (iii) €522 million invested in the France segment (mainly in
renewable projects), and (iv) €292 million to develop Solairedirect's photovoltaic projects mainly in India and
France;

e maintenance investments for an amount of €2,471 million.

Disposals represented a cash amount of €4,617 million, mainly including the Group's disposal of its thermal merchant
power plant assets in the United States for €3,085 million, the Polaniec power plant in Poland for €292 million, the Group's
10% interest in Petronet LNG in India for €436 million, a power plant portfolio in the United Kingdom for €232 million, a

The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets was €57.5 billion, down €6.9 billion on
December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of the impact of the classification of exploration-production
activities as “Discontinued operations” and of the Loy Yang B coal-fired power plant in Australia under “Assets held for
sale” (€5.3 billion negative impact) (see Note 4.1.1), depreciation and amortization charges (€4.2 billion negative impact),
translation adjustments (€1.9 billion negative impact), impairment losses (€1.0 billion negative impact) and changes in the
scope of consolidation (€0.6 billion negative impact), partially offset by capital expenditure during the period (€6.2 billion
positive impact).

Goodwill was stable at €17.3 billion, mainly due to the acquisition of Keepmoat Regeneration (€0.5 billion positive impact),
non-controlling interests in La Compagnie du Vent (€0.1 billion positive impact), Icomera (€0.1 billion positive impact) and
EV-Box (€0.1 billion positive impact), offset by impairment losses (€0.5 billion negative impact) and translation adjustments
(€0.4 billion negative impact).

Total equity amounted to €42.6 billion, a decrease of €2.9 billion compared with December 31, 2016. The decrease
stemmed mainly from the payment of the cash dividend (€2.7 billion negative impact, including €2.0 billion of dividends
paid by ENGIE SA to its shareholders and €0.7 billion paid to non-controlling interests) and other items of comprehensive
income (€2.5 billion negative impact, chiefly relating to movements in translation adjustments as a result of items recycled
to profit or loss from other comprehensive income on the disposal of the thermal merchant power plant portfolio in the
United States and the depreciation of the US dollar against the euro), partially offset by net income for the period
(€2.2 billion positive impact).

Provisions amounted to €21.7 billion, a decrease of €0.4 billion compared with December 31, 2016. This decrease stems
mainly (€1.3 billion) from the impact of the classification of exploration-production activities as “Discontinued operations”
on May 11, 2017 (see Note 4.1.1), partially offset by provisions for onerous contracts relating to storage and transport
capacity reservation contracts (see Note 8.5).

At December 31, 2017, assets and liabilities reclassified to “Assets classified as held for sale” and “Liabilities directly
associated with assets classified as held for sale” correspond to exploration-production activities following their
classification as discontinued operations in the Group's consolidated financial statements and the Loy Yang B power plant
in Australia, and at December 31, 2016, to the thermal merchant power plant portfolio in the United States and the Polaniec
power plant in Poland, which were sold in the first half of 2017 (see Note 4.1).

MANAGEMENT REPORT

8 PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The figures provided below relate to the financial statements of ENGIE SA, prepared in accordance with French GAAP.
and applicable regulations.

Revenues for ENGIE SA in 2017 totaled €20,585 million, up 15% compared to 2016 due mainly to the impact of the
increase in electricity sales.

The net operating loss was €1,358 million in 2017 versus €1,252 million in 2016 due to the combined effect of higher
electricity sales offset by a lower margin on gas sales, mainly further to a loss of customers, and the reduction in overheads
thanks to the Group’s cost savings program.

The Company reported net financial income of €3,849 million compared with €1,294 million in 2016. The sharp increase is
due to dividends received from subsidiaries (€4,214 million compared with €2,043 million in 2016) and in particular
Electrabel, which paid a €1,641 million dividend in the form of a contribution of Electrabel France shares, and GRDF, which
paid a €1,007 million dividend, including the reimbursement of issue premiums for €738 million.

Net non-recurring expenses amounted to €2,072 million, chiefly due to the combined effect of additions to amortization of
securities net of reversals (negative €1,538 million), provisions for the restructuring of the workforce and real estate
(negative €113 million), penalties paid on the early redemption of bonds (negative €93 million), offset by the capital gain
generated on the sale of the Elengy shares to GRTgaz (positive €73 million) and the reversal of the provision for price
increases (positive €43 million).

The income tax benefit amounted to €1,001 million compared to a benefit of €672 million in 2016. The difference is chiefly
due to the repayment by the State of the 3% tax on dividends (€422 million) after it was declared invalid by the Constitutional
Council.

Net income for the year came out at €1,421 million.

Shareholders’ equity amounted to €37,191 million at end-2017 versus €37,976 million at December 31, 2016, reflecting
the dividend payout, the impact of the first-time application of ANC Regulation No. 2015-05 on financial instruments
(negative €144 million) and 2017 net income.

At December 31, 2017, net debt stood at €34,254 million, and cash and cash equivalents totaled €8,862 million (of which
€6,185 relating to subsidiaries’ current accounts).
