Value management

OMV'‘s business model of being an integrated oil and gas company requires special focus on both
evaluating long-term investment projects and managing short to medium-term cash flow and cost

Integration creates
additional value

positions. Value management is, therefore, an integral part of OMV’s management system. To
properly reflect imminent business-relevant uncertainties and risks, value management is closely

linked to risk management.

The guiding role of value management is
reflected both in OMV’s planning and decision-
making process as well as in the metrics, Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs) and control
functions of OMV’s management information
system. OMV’s value management approach is
designed to address the following issues:
> How does OMV create value?
> How well does OMV make use of its

profit potential?
>» How do OMV shareholders participate in

the value created?

At the OMV corporate level, market capitalization
and enterprise value are examples of mid- to
long-term value creation-related metrics. The
short-term financial success derived from
implementing strategies and investment
projects is measured using various best-practice
profitability KPls, the leading ones being

Return On Average Capital Employed (ROACE)
and Return On Net Assets (RONA) as well as
Economic Value Added (EVA). While ROACE

is relevant for the overall Group, RONA is an
efficient metric for the internal assessment of
the financial success of the business segments
since RONA enables the breakdown of the
ROACE Group target to individual businesses.
Shareholder participation in value creation

is measured using metrics such as payout ratio
and total shareholder return. OMV’s dividend

Ratios

Return On Average Capital Employed (ROACE)
Gearing ratio
Payout ratio

policy is a long-term payout ratio target of 30%
of net income. As a physically integrated oil

and gas company with activities throughout the
value chain from resources to markets, OMV

is able to create additional value from optimal
capital allocation and risk mitigation and to take
advantage of the full product value. Choosing
the right investment projects has a substantial
influence on determining future success.
Investment projects’ rates of return have to
exceed business segment-specific hurdle rates.
In addition, investment projects are ranked by the
expected profitability. Value management also
implies cost management. During the planning
exercise cost targets are formulated, both relative
to output figures (e.g. production cost/boe) and
in terms of absolute amounts of cost savings

to be achieved. A corporate value analysis is
performed as part of OMV’s annual planning
process, which involves a critical examination of
the current strategy’s success in achieving the
Group’s value creation targets. Additional special
emphasis is put on maintaining OMV's strong
investment grade credit rating and on delivering
a neutral free cash flow after dividends. Proper
management of the financing structure including
working capital is a key focus area in this regard.
At OMV, value management delivers essential
decision-making support and enables effective
business steering by defining and balancing
targets.

OMV share and bonds

2014 was a volatile year for the financial markets. The share price of OMV was negatively impacted
by the sharp decrease in oil prices as well as political unrest and closed at EUR 22.01 at year-end.
Including the dividend for the financial year 2013, this led to a negative total shareholder return of
(33)% for the year 2014. Against this backdrop, OMV successfully placed a EUR 750 mn four-year
Eurobond with a coupon of 0.6% in order to improve the debt maturity profile.

Financial markets

In 2014, the financial markets were very volatile
and heavily influenced by investors’ sentiment
towards geopolitical issues, namely the Russian-
Ukrainian crisis escalating in mid-2014 followed
by economic sanctions against Russia, and the
ongoing political instability in North Africa and
the Middle East. Furthermore, overcapacities of
crude supply led to a significant decrease in oil
prices. The Brent oil price closed at USD 54.98
at year-end, down by 50% since the beginning
of the year. The FTSE Global Energy Index,
comprising the world’s largest oil and gas
companies, decreased by 13%. European and
US indices rose slightly as follows: DAX +3%,
FTSE Eurotop 100 +3%, Dow Jones +8%. The
Vienna Stock Exchange underperformed the
European markets and the Austrian blue-chip
index (ATX) decreased by 15% in 2014. Its
performance was affected by the relatively weak
share price performance of the Banking and
Energy sector, alongside businesses with major
stakes in Russia.

OMV share price performance and volume

The OMV share price started to increase at the
beginning of the year and reached the year’s
high of EUR 36.06 by mid-January after closing
the year 2013 at EUR 34.79. From that point on,
the OMV share price only decreased slightly
through to the mid-year, and stood at EUR 33.00
at the end of the second quarter 2014. Declining
crude prices together with geopolitical instability
led to a substantial decrease in the stock price
towards the end of the year 2014, reaching its
bottom in mid-December at EUR 20.07 and
closing 2014 at EUR 22.01. Market capitalization
was approximately EUR 7 bn at year-end. The
total capitalization of all Austrian shares listed
on the Vienna Stock Exchange decreased by
7% to EUR 76 bn, out of which OMV's market
capitalization represented 9%. The overall
share turnover at the Vienna Stock Exchange
rose by 23% to EUR 48 bn. The volume of OMV
stock traded was approximately EUR 5 bn and
accounted for 11% of total stock turnover at the
Vienna Stock Exchange (2013: 12%).

Annual General Meeting results

The main items dealt with at the Annual General
Meeting on May 14, 2014 were: 1) the approval of
a dividend of EUR 1.25 per share for 2013, which
corresponds to a payout ratio of approximately
35%; 2) the election of the members to the
Supervisory Board as proposed; 3) the approval
of the Long Term Incentive Plan 2014, which is

a long-term compensation instrument for the
Executive Board and selected senior executives
introduced in order to promote mid- and long-
term value creation at OMV; 4) the approval of
the Matching Share Plan 2014, an integral part of
the annual bonus agreement which is a long-
term compensation vehicle for the members of
the Executive Board and combines the interests
of management and shareholders.

As in previous years, an employee stock
ownership plan launched in fall 2014 entitled
employees to one free share for every three
purchased, subject to a two-year holding period.

38 | OMV Annual Report 2014 | OMV share and bonds

At year-end 2014, OMV held a total of 1,015,102
own shares, or 0.3% of issued share capital.
The number of shares in circulation was

thus 326,257,625. The capital stock of OMV
Aktiengesellschaft is EUR 327,272,727 and
consists of 327,272,727 no par value bearer
shares. The Executive Board will propose

a dividend of EUR 1.25 per share at the next
Annual General Meeting on May 19, 2015. This is
the same absolute level as in the previous year.
The dividend yield, based on the closing price on
the last trading day of 2014, will amount to 5.68%.

Credit ratings

OMV is rated A3 by Moody's (last update in June
2014) and A- by Fitch (last update in December
2014). Both rating agencies confirmed their rating
as well as the stable outlook assessment. This
underscored the creditworthiness of OMV and

is in line with the target to maintain a strong
investment grade credit rating.

Bonds

In November 2014, OMV issued a EUR 750 mn
four-year Eurobond with a coupon of 0.6% under
the Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) program in
order to improve the debt maturity profile.

OMV shareholder structure

OMV's shareholder structure was relatively
unchanged in 2014 and therefore at year-

end comprised: 43.3% free float, 31.5% OIAG
(representing the Austrian government), 24.9%
International Petroleum Investment Company
(IPIC) and 0.3% own shares. The capital stock
consists entirely of common shares and due
to the application of the one-share one-vote
principle there are no classes of shares that
bear special rights. A consortium agreement
between the two major shareholders, IPIC
and OIAG, contains established arrangements
for coordinated action and restrictions on the
transfer of shareholdings.

Global oil demand
for 2014 slightly
increased

Contrary to general expectations, 2014 did not
bring a sustainable recovery in global economic
growth. Global trade grew at a moderate level,
expanding by 3.1%, while the growth rate for

the global economy fell short of the long-term
average, at 3.3%, and was unchanged on a year
earlier. The pace of growth in developing and
emerging economies slowed to 4.4%, while
economies in the OECD region improved slightly,
with GDP growth of 1.8%. Within the OECD
countries the upturn was significantly stronger in
North America (up by 2.4%) than in the Eurozone,
which posted gains of just 0.8%.

After stagnating in 2013, the European Union
economy achieved a moderate rise in GDP of
1.3%. A steady decline in exports throughout
the course of the year, combined with continued
sluggish investment activity and muted
consumer sentiment, held growth in check.

Despite signs of cooling off in the second half
of the year, the German economy reported

an increase in GDP of 1.5% on the back of
strong export growth in 2014. The Austrian
economy grew by just 0.3% as a result of the
slowdown experienced in the second half of the
year. Consumer spending edged up by 0.2%.
In Romania, the economy continued to grow
during the reporting period and GDP rose by
2.9%. Industrial production jumped by 6.1%.

Turkey's economic output advanced by 2.8%
in 2014. Industrial production was some 3.6%
higher, similar to the previous year. The high
balance of payments deficit was reduced by
around a quarter to 6% of GDP.

Global oil demand for 2014 went up by

0.8% — clearly weaker than the year earlier —

to 92.5 mn bbi/d. At 46.8 mn bbl/d, demand
from non-OECD countries increased by 2.4%,
outstripping growth rates of industrial countries
for the first time. Within the OECD region, oil
demand remained steady in North America

and declined in European and Pacific OECD
countries by 2.2% and 2.4% respectively. Global
oil production increased by 1.9 mn bbl/d or 2.1%
to 93.3 mn bbl/d. Stocks rose steadily throughout
the year by an average of 0.8 mn bbi/d. Tapping
into new, unconventional resources enabled
North America to boost production by some 9%
or 1.6 mn bbli/d. OPEC production declined by
0.2 mn bbl/d to 30.3 mn bbi/d of crude oil and
6.4 mn bbl/d of NGL. Increased production in
Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia almost compensated
fully for the 50% drop in production in Libya
and moderate declines in several other OPEC
countries.

Brent opened the year at around USD 108/bbl
on the Rotterdam spot market. By mid-June,
the price had reached its intra-year high of

more than USD 115/bbl, owing to the military
conflicts in Iraq, Libya, Syria and the Ukraine.
From then on, factors such as the muted global
economic outlook and rising supply increasingly
drove prices downward. By the time the OPEC
conference took place in late November, crude
prices had fallen below USD 80/bbI. Once it
became clear that there would be no move

to adjust OPEC production, the price slid by a
further USD 25/bbl by the end of the year. At
USD 98.95/bbl, the average Brent price was 9%
down on the 2013 average of USD 108.66/bbl.
The euro prices of the main petroleum products
traded in Rotterdam dropped by 7 to 10%.

The euro remained relatively strong in the first
half of the year, but weakened significantly
during the last six months of 2014 due to the
economic slowdown and increasingly loose
monetary policy. Over the year, the average
EUR-USD FX-rate remained unchanged on the
comparative period at USD 1.33 per EUR.

Following a decline of 6% in 2013, demand for
natural gas in Austria fell once again in 2014, by
a further 8% to 7.4 bcm or 83 TWh. This drop was
again chiefly attributable to the sharp decline in
gas-fired power generation. Domestic natural
gas output slipped by 9% to 1.2 bcm, while net
imports surged by 22% to 7.4 bem. The supply
overhang led to injections into gas storage
facilities. In combination with the increase in
storage capacity to 8.1 bcm, this helped to
significantly improve security of supply. At
year-end, gas in storage amounted to 6.1 bcm,
for a percentage full rate of 76%. Gas demand in
Romania decreased by 4% to 12 bem (129 TWh)
in 2014. In Turkey, gas demand increased by
about 6% to 48 bcm (518 TWh).

Electricity consumption in Romania was stable
at 53 TWh and increased in Turkey by about
4% to 256 TWh.

Petroleum product sales in the markets supplied
by OMV (Central and Southeastern Europe, and
Turkey) declined by about 1% to some 169 mnt
in 2014, owing to weak demand for heating oil.

The market for automotive fuels expanded by
around 3 mnt, albeit with demand for diesel
outstripping that for gasoline. Heating oil sales
contracted significantly: the total decline for
Germany and Austria amounted to around

3.3 mn t. In Austria, petroleum product sales
dropped by almost 3% to 10.7 mn t. Demand

for diesel fell by about 1%, while gasoline sales
contracted by some 2%. Aviation fuel sales
increased by 1%. Sales of heating oil were

down by more than 10%, largely due to weather
conditions and the resulting drop in space
heating demand. In Germany, sales of petroleum
products fell by 2%. While fuel sales were up
(5% for diesel and 2% for gasoline), demand

for heating oil declined significantly, dropping
13% year-on-year. Overall demand in Romania
was down by 2%. Gasoline sales (down by 4%)
declined more sharply than those of diesel (down
by 2%). Demand for aviation fuel soared by 13%.
The trends seen on the market for petroleum
products in Turkey point to an overall increase
of 4% primarily driven by a rise in fuel sales.

The West European market for polyolefins
grew significantly by 0.6 mn t or 3.4% in 2014.
Polyethylene sales prices increased by 2%,
but those of polypropylene shrank by 3%. The
integrated producers’ margin was up by about
25% on the previous year.

Production ramp-up
in Norway

Exploration and Production

2014 was a challenging year for the business segment Exploration and Production (E&P). Total
production in mature core countries (Romania and Austria) was kept at a stable level in line with the
strategic target of 200-210 kboe/d. Production in Romania showed a second year of marginal growth.
Norway's production ramp-up to 50 kboe/d towards the end of the year is a strong indicator that

the North Sea region is becoming a core area for the Group. In contrast, the rest of the international
portfolio was impacted by production interruptions in Libya and Yemen due to security issues.

From an exploration point of view, 2014 was a less successful year with an overall success rate
significantly below previous years. This year’s discoveries were made onshore and offshore
Romania, while in Norway the Wisting discovery was successfully appraised. In Abu Dhabi, Namibia,
Gabon and Bulgaria large license areas were covered by 3D seismic.

Health, Safety, Security and Environment
(HSSE) is E&P’s first priority

The Lost-Time Injury Rate (LTIR) in E&P.
improved (0.53) compared to last year (2013:
0.66). Regrettably, E&P had two work-related
fatalities in operations maintenance. The
incidents have been investigated thoroughly
by senior E&P management to determine root
causes and far-reaching measures have been
initiated to prevent recurrence. In 2014, the
incidents with a potentially high impact have
decreased substantially. These incidents are
investigated and the resulting recommendations
and actions are monitored to closure. In addition
to maintaining the focus on occupational health
and safety, process safety, road transportation
safety, lifting operations and electrical
maintenance continue to be our highest
priority focus areas.

Financial performance

Clean EBIT came in 20% lower than in 2013 at
EUR 1,669 mn, in spite of the contribution from
Norway (production included since November
2013), which was more than offset by higher
depreciation, increased production costs and
lower oil prices. The Group’s average realized
crude price in USD/bbl decreased by 9% while
the average realized gas price in EUR increased
by 13% compared to the 2013 level. Exploration
expenses decreased by 10% to EUR 460 mn in
2014, as 2013 included write-offs of exploration
licenses in the Kurdistan Region of lraq and higher
write-offs of exploration wells in Norway. With

a total of EUR 2,951 mn, E&P investments were
33% lower than in the previous year, as 2013
included the acquisition of the assets from Statoil.
Investments in 2014 were mainly directed towards
field redevelopments, drilling and workover

Norway and the United Kingdom. Net special
items of EUR (203) mn in 2014 were mainly related
to the impairment of the TOC asset in Kazakhstan
and led to a reported EBIT of EUR 1,466 mn, 26%
below the level of 2013.

Production increased compared to the level of
2013, as Norway's contribution was higher and
more than offset the lower production volumes
in Libya. Total hydrocarbon production increased
by 8% to 112.9 mn boe. This corresponds to an
average daily production of 309 kboe/d.

In Romania, our investment program helped

us to achieve our second year of marginal
production growth with an average production
of 171.4 kboe/d. Austrian production was
impacted by technical issues with average
production at 33.0 kboe/d, below last year’s level.
The production of the international portfolio

has increased compared to the previous year
mainly due to increased production in Norway,
Pakistan, New Zealand and Yemen. In Libya,
production was interrupted several times during
the year and was largely shut-down in the fourth
quarter of the year. The construction of the new
Glen Lyon FPSO vessel for the Schiehallion

field redevelopment project (United Kingdom)
has almost been completed and the Rosebank
development (United Kingdom) has undergone
significant design optimization. In New Zealand,
we had first production contribution from the
Maari Growth project towards the end of the
year. In Tunisia, the Final Investment Decision
was taken for the Nawara development project.
Pakistan experienced a significant increase

in production as a result of the completed
Mehar and Latif field developments. In Yemen,
despite the volatile security situation, production
increased significantly in 2014 compared to 2013.

Production costs excluding royalties in USD/boe
(OPEX) increased by 19% compared to 2013,
mainly reflecting the change in country mix, with
contribution from Norway with higher production
costs and lower volumes from Libya, and the
new construction tax in Romania.

A challenging exploration year

In 2014, OMV drilled 34 exploration wells in
eight different countries, spanning from New
Zealand to Norway, and completed 29 of
these. 56% of the wells were operated by OMV
and the exploration success ratio was 21%
(2013: 46%). Eleven exploration and appraisal
high impact wells were completed in 2014.
The Wisting discovery in Norway (2013) was
appraised by the Hanssen-1 appraisal well
which confirmed the Wisting area potential.
Further appraisal wells will be needed to
delineate the accumulation. In the Black Sea,
after interpretation of the 3D data collected in
2013, drilling in the deep water parts of the
Neptun Block (Romania) has commenced to test
additional prospects of the area. The 3D seismic
collected in 2013 in the Han Asparuh block in
Bulgaria has been evaluated and will be the
basis for defining future drilling opportunities.
Sub-Saharan Africa exploration activities have
progressed substantially and two large 3D
seismic surveys were conducted across OMV’s
Namibia acreage (5,000 km?) and over OMV’s
Gabon licenses (8,570 km2). These will be the
basis for further opportunity assessments in
the respective licenses. Additionally, OMV has
picked up substantial new exploration acreage
in the United Kingdom (West of Britain), two
new licenses in New Zealand and significant
acreage in Pakistan (Kirthar fold belt).

Total production
inceased by 8% vs.
2013

Proved hydrocarbon reserves (1P) as of
December 31, 2014, were 1,090 mn boe (thereof
OMV Petrom: 690 mn boe) and proved and
probable oil and gas reserves (2P) amounted
to 1,813 mn boe (thereof OMV Petrom:

977 mn boe). The 2014 single-year Reserve
Replacement Rate (RRR) was 64% (2013: 113%).
The three-year average RRR stood at 87% in
2014 (2013: 93%). In Romania and Austria,

the three-year average RRR decreased to 41%
(2013: 49%). In the international portfolio, the
three-year average RRR decreased to 188%
(2013: 203%), which includes reserves from the
recent acquisitions in Norway and the United
Kingdom.

Marginal production
increase in Romania
for the second year

in a row

OMV’‘s core countries: Romania and Austria

In Romania, production averaged 171.4 kboe/d
for the year, slightly higher than in the previous
year and marking the second year of marginal
growth in the past decade. Projects and
optimization initiatives have been offsetting the
natural decline for two years now. Throughout
the year, redevelopment projects of key fields
progressed. OMV Petrom succeeded in having
twelve field redevelopment (FRD) projects in
execution phase, out of which six FRDs passed
Final Investment Decision (FID) this year.
Additionally, two FRDs were completed. The
works to optimize gas production systems and
to modernize surface facilities and equipment
in selected major fields continued. In 2014,
the largest exploration investments were
made since privatization in 2004. In 2014, the
exploration success rate was 60%. OMV Petrom
maintained a leading position in Romania

by obtaining the extension of exploration
blocks license for another three years. The
drilling program in the deep water sector of

Worldwide exploration and production portfolio

the Neptun Block in the Black Sea (offshore
Romania) has been resumed. The Domino-2
appraisal well was drilled, followed by an
exploration well (Pelican South-1), undergoing
drilling over the year-end. The results and data
gathered will be evaluated.

In Austria, production decreased to 33.0 kboe/d
in 2014 (34.6 kboe/d in 2013). This level mostly
reflected the production challenges with three
big gas wells, as well as planned and unplanned
interruptions. The year-end production level in
Austria, however, stood at the same rate as at the
start of January. Several activities contributed
to keeping this level of production and
counterbalancing the natural decline, including
15 new wells put in production and three
finalized field redevelopment (FRD) projects.
OMV Austria had a full year with nine workover
or well intervention rigs which contributed ~2
kboe/d. Investments were made mainly for the
execution of four major projects and several
small surface debottleneck projects.

OMV'‘s international portfolio

In Norway, OMV has successfully developed
its portfolio. After the acquisition of two

major assets from Statoil in the second half

of 2013, OMV Norway started 2014 with an
increase in production of approximately

28 kboe/d from the Gullfaks field (OMV share:
19%) followed by the production start-up of the
Gudrun field (OMV share: 24%) in April, which
then ramped up production with additional
wells coming on stream throughout the

year. At Gullfaks, with 118 wells available for
production, five new wells were put on stream
in 2014 in addition to some recompletions

of existing wells. Production progress was
significant in 2014 as the four new wells from
Gudrun increased the production rate in
Norway to 50 kboe/d towards year-end. Average
production in 2014 stood at 35.2 kboe/d. The
Edvard Grieg field development (operated

by Lundin) made good progress with the
successful installation of the jacket in May,

the laying of the gas pipeline and the start

of development drilling in September. For
Aasta Hansteen, a Statoil operated deep

water gas development in the Norwegian Sea,
construction of the spar platform started in
South Korea in the second quarter of 2014.
OMYV is also participating in a new 480 km

gas pipeline, Polarled, and an upgrade of the
existing Nyhamna gas processing plant. Both
are needed to evacuate the gas from Aasta
Hansteen and potentially from the Zidane field
development project, and represent important
new infrastructure for Norway. OMV operated
exploration drilling in the PL537 Barents Sea
license, which contains the Wisting discovery
made in 2013, resulted in a successful appraisal
well (Hanssen) in the summer of 2014. This well
was also tested and confirmed earlier resource
estimates for the Wisting discovery, which
continues appraisal in 2015. Another successful
appraisal well was drilled in PL 359 (North Sea)
in the Luno 2 discovery, where OMV increased
its share from 15% to 20%. Overall, OMV built
up its acreage in Norway to a total of 36 licenses
(2013: 31), of which nine are operated.

In New Zealand, OMV completed its exploration
drilling campaign with the Matuku-1 well in
February and the Whio-1 well in August. Both
wells were drilled under OMV operatorship. No
commercial accumulations of hydrocarbons
could be confirmed. In April, an offshore jack up
drilling unit was brought into the country and
started drilling new development wells in the
Maari field. Production operations continued
during drilling and construction activities in

the Maari field. The first new well in Maari was
brought on stream in November. Total average
daily production in New Zealand amounted to
18.7 kboe/d, higher than in the previous year
(16.5 kboe/d). In the Great South Basin (license
PEP 50119; OMV share: 21.95%), the joint venture
entered into a drilling commitment for one well
to be drilled by June 2016. In 2014, OMV was
successful in the New Zealand exploration block
awards and secured two new offshore permits
with 100% OMV interest. At year-end, OMV holds
interests in New Zealand in eleven licenses: three
production and eight exploration permits (six as
operator).

In Australia, the Zola discovery was appraised by
the Bianchi appraisal well, which was drilled in
2013, finding multiple gas-bearing sands with net
gas pay estimated more than 100 meter. OMV
holds six licenses in total: two retention leases
over the Zola and Nasutus discoveries and four
exploration licenses.

Execution of

the Nawara gas
fiel development
started

In Tunisia, the Final Investment Decision (FID)
for the Nawara development project was taken
in March 2014. The project will allow OMV

and the Tunisian National Oil Company ETAP

to monetize gas and condensate produced in
South Tunisia and includes a central processing
facility in the South, a 370 km pipeline to Gabes
and a gas treatment plant at Gabes. Related
engineering, procurement, construction and
commissioning contracts were signed in August
2014 and construction works were started. First
production of gas is expected to start in 2017.
Overall production in Tunisia decreased slightly to
9.5 kboe/d (2013: 10.1 kboe/d). The reduction was
mainly due to natural reservoir decline combined

Increased share

in the Cambo field
for a potential
“hub development”

with delays to workovers in Cercina, Cherouq and
Ashtart concessions and to new wells coming
on stream. In South Tunisia, the Cherouq gas
valorization project was finished and operations
started in April 2014, allowing OMV to deliver
previously flared gas to the local market and
increase overall production. Furthermore, the
FID for the Anaguid East development was

taken in June 2014. A new development well
was spudded in November 2014 in the Guebiba
concession (operated by TPS; OMV share: 49%),
first oil is expected in early 2015. Furthermore,
the safety performance was significantly
improved in Tunisia, achieving one year with no
Lost-Time Injuries (LTI) on Ashtart in 2014 (Serept
operated; OMV share: 50%) and two years LTI
free on Waha Central Processing Facility.

In Libya, production varied significantly during
the year, reflecting the deteriorating security
situation across the country. This prompted OMV
to decide to evacuate non-Libyan personnel from
Tripoli during the summer. Yearly production
averaged around 8.8 kboe/d (2013: 21.6 kboe/d)
which represents approximately 28% of OMV’s
production potential in the country. During the
first half of 2014, three exploration wells were
drilled in the Murzuq basin, resulting in one new
oil discovery (Wedan well in NC186).

In the United Kingdom, OMV is focusing on
developments in the area West of Shetland
where OMV increased its share in the
Schiehallion and Rosebank developments in
2013 (to ~11.8% and 50% respectively). In 2014,
OMV increased its share in the Cambo field
from 15% to 47.5% and assumed operatorship
from Hess. This, together with the Tornado
and Suilven discoveries (both OMV operated)
positions OMV as operator of a potential Cambo
“hub development”, underlining our position
as a key player in the West of Shetland area.
The Rosebank development has undergone
significant design optimization and is now fit
for Front End Engineering and Design (FEED)
completion. The Schiehallion redevelopment
has made good progress with the removal of
the old FPSO (Floating Production Storage and

46 | OMV Annual Report 2014 | Exploration and Production

Offloading unit) from the field. Work continues
on completion of the new FPSO in South Korea
and on the subsea installation to connect existing
and new wells to the FPSO. In total, OMV holds
36 licenses, with eleven as operator.

In Pakistan, the 2014 total production was

15.6 kboe/d, significantly higher than in the
previous year (11.0 kboe/d) as a result of the
successful completion of the field developments
Latif and Mehar in the last quarter of 2013.
Marketing constraints for Mehar condensate, due
to processing limitations in the local refineries,
have been solved and OMV is now exporting
part of the condensate production. Further
development options of the Mehar field and

the satellite Sofiya field have been screened

but postponed until the completion of further
appraisal work in the area.

In Yemen, the security situation remained
volatile during 2014. Although the increased
security measures around the Habban field
enabled safe operations within the concession
area, production performance was reduced

due to security incidents outside the perimeter.
Road blockages affecting transportation,

labor disputes and several attacks on the oil
export pipeline caused sporadic production
shutdowns. The average production in 2014 was
6.4 kboe/d, an increase of 33% as compared to
2013 (4.8 kboe/d). The execution of the Habban
field development project, which includes the
construction of the central processing facility

as well as drilling and workover operations,
successfully progressed. Five new production
wells were drilled and put on production. The
selected concept for a condensate recovery plant
and a gas export pipeline will help to reduce CO,
emissions. The seismic acquisition projects are
delayed due to the unstable security situation.

In order to reduce the financial exposure, all
investments are pursued only to the extent they
can be financed by current production revenues.

Following the discovery of the Bina Bawi field
in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (IKRI), extended
well tests in the wells Bina Bawi-4, -5 and -6 were


--- Page 12 ---

completed in 2014 and resulted in only limited
(sub-commercial) oil volumes but a significant
sour gas potential. Commercialization activities
for Bina Bawi sour gas have been ongoing
throughout 2014 but were not successful.
Consequently, in late 2014, OMV commenced
farm-out negotiations with Genel Energy which
are still ongoing. Pearl Petroleum Company
Limited continued producing in 2014 at a gross
production average of 71.7 kboe/d (68.8 kboe/d
in 2013). OMV holds a 10% (equity consolidated)
interest in the company.

In Kazakhstan, production decreased to

8.9 kboe/d (2013: 11.2 kboe/d) due to required
partial replacement of the Turkmenoi pipeline
and natural production decline.

In the United Arab Emirates, OMV signed an
agreement with ADNOC to explore for oil and
gas in the Eastern region of UAE in 2013. A three

well appraisal program of the field was designed
by the consortium (OMV and Wintershall) and
the first well Shuwaihat-5 spudded in May 2014.
Drilling of the well is ongoing. At the request of
ADNOC, OMV and Wintershall also completed

a technical evaluation of possible further oil and
gas field developments. Seismic acquisition
commenced in July 2014 and is progressing

as planned. If the exploration campaign is
successful, ADNOC and OMV intend to jointly
develop potential discoveries. The exploration
activity agreement has a duration of four years.

In Bulgaria, OMV (as operator) completed a 3D
seismic acquisition campaign in the Black Sea,
performed most of the seismic data processing
and completed a sea-bottom survey. The
interpretation of new seismic data progressed
with the aim of identifying the drilling locations.
OMV handed over operatorship for drilling to
Total in April 2014.

Gas and Power

For Gas and Power (G&P), the overall market environment remained challenging; nevertheless, key
decisions were taken in 2014 to increase profitability. The supply, marketing and trading business
renegotiated the long-term gas supply contract with Gazprom and agreed a structural solution which
reflects changing market conditions. In turn, the same business unit started marketing Norwegian

Gas supply now

market conditions

equity gas volumes of more than 8.4 TWh. The gas logistics business successfully finalized the
consolidation of the gas transportation business in Austria.

Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE)
HSSE plays an essential role within G&P. There
has been a continuous improvement in the
safety performance over the last few years,
partly because we engage with our workforce
and take a closer look at our operations through
management walk-arounds. We reduced the
Lost-Time Injury Rate (LTI) from 1.86 in 2013

to 0.00 in 2014 and the Total Recordable Injury
Rate from 6.49 in 2013 to 0.41 in 2014, and

had no High Potential Incidents (HIPO) in 2014.
We recorded no LTI at the Brazi power plant
(Romania) since November 2011 and none

at the Samsun power plant (Turkey) since
September 2013. We further increased the
overall HSSE focus in 2014 with leadership and
other special training on our incident reporting
system. The focus for 2015 is based on the
OMV vision “ZERO Harm — NO Losses”, further
improvement of the overall safety performance,
visible commitment, leadership, contractor
management, risk management, development
of HSSE competences and increased hazard
awareness.

Financial performance

Clean EBIT decreased by 27% to EUR 101 mn
due to lower contributions from all business
units. Reported EBIT was EUR (162) mn due to
net special items of EUR (263) mn, mainly related
to the impairment of the Brazi power plant

and the impairment of goodwill related to the
Petrol Ofisi acquisition. The result of the supply,
marketing and trading business unit decreased
mainly due to lower contributions from Romania
and Turkey. Total gas sales and trading volumes
increased by 14% to 486 TWh driven by
increased trading activities. The weak gas market
environment and warm weather conditions led
to a decrease in gas sales volumes in EconGas as
well as in Romania. EconGas’s result was at last
year’s level, supported by the adjusted long-term
gas supply contracts. The gas sales margin in
Romania was negatively impacted by additional
storage and transportation costs. Due to the
unfavorable USD-TRY FX-rate development in
2014, the gas business in Turkey was burdened
as the supply volumes were purchased in USD,
whereas the sales price for wholesalers and local
consumers were in TRY and heavily influenced
by the local market leader. The business unit

gas logistics recorded a slightly lower result vs.
2013. The gas transportation business result
came in below last year’s level mainly due

to the restructuring of the Trans Austria Gas
(TAG) pipeline operations. The storage business
contribution decreased vs. 2013, mainly due

to the tariff reduction for running gas storage
contracts, which has been in place for customers
in Austria since July 2013. The power business
recorded a net electrical output of 5.81 TWh,
mainly as a result of increased output from

the gas-fired Samsun power plant. The output
of the gas-fired Brazi power plant decreased
significantly. The result of the power business
was burdened by unfavorable market conditions
in Romania. The Samsun power plant achieved a
positive result driven by favorable spark spreads
and additional income from balancing and
ancillary market services.

The gas transportation business was subjected
to a further increase in regulatory guidelines.
Consequently, Gas Connect Austria (GCA)

was merged with Baumgarten Oberkappel-
Gasleitungsgesellschaft m.b.H. (BOG) in
September 2014 and spun off its Trans Austria
Gasleitung (TAG pipeline) service activities into
Trans Austria Gasleitung GmbH in October 2014,
receiving additional shares in return. During
2014, the new market model continued to work
successfully in the Austrian gas transportation
business, resulting in an increase in short-

term transportation contracts. The utilization
rate of GCA’s network was stable despite the
general decrease in demand in the national and
international gas markets. This reflects Austria’s
gas turntable position and the upturn in trading
volumes traded at the Central European Gas

OMV Trading
started to market
equity gas from the
Gudrun field

Hub (CEGH). The merger of GCA and BOG
created further cost and marketing synergies;
the unbundling requirements under European
and Austrian law were met by the TAG service
activities spin-off. After this consolidation, two
natural gas Transmission System Operators
(TSOs) remained, both certified as Independent
Transmission System Operators (ITOs), in
Austria. GCA progressed several projects,
working on a firm reversal of the Hungarian-
Austrian pipeline (HAG) in the direction from
Hungary to Austria in the context of the pan-
European Projects of Common Interests, on
the tie-in concept of the South Stream project
in Baumgarten, and continuing to work on the
Bidirectional Austrian-Czech Interconnector
project, the latter in the context of a potential
future Czech-Austrian trading region. The whole
project work was performed in cooperation with
the Austrian and the adjacent countries’ TSOs
including their regulatory authorities.

In 2014, the gas storage business in Austria
recorded the highest storage level in history
at the beginning of the winter season. The
overall market situation remained challenging
due to continuing low summer/winter spreads.
Nevertheless, the available storage capacity

in Austria and Germany was marketed
completely. In 2014, the second tranche of

gas caverns in the German storage facility Etzel
were filled for the first time with 4 TWh.

In 2014, 440 TWh of natural gas were traded on
the Central European Gas Hub Virtual Trading
Point (CEGH-VTP), an increase of 12% compared
to 2013. By the end of 2014, CEGH had 180
registered members. At the CEGH Gas Exchange
of Wiener Boerse, the traded volume increased
by more than 60% to 21.27 TWh, compared to the
previous year. In August 2014, CEGH launched
additional products at the CEGH Futures Market
in Austria: quarterly futures, seasons and yearly
futures with delivery at the CEGH-VTP in Austria.
Volumes at the Futures Market in 2014 increased
more than sixfold compared to the previous
year, to a total volume of 2.32 TWh. In December

50 | OMV Annual Report 2014 | Gas and Power

2013, CEGH launched a Gas Futures Market in the
Czech Republic. In its first full year of operation,
total traded volumes at the CEGH Czech Gas
Futures reached 745 GWh in 2014, with a monthly
all time high of 317.6 GWh in December 2014.

Supply, marketing and trading

Overall gas sales and trading volumes increased
to 486 TWh, an increase of 14% vs. 2013, mainly
driven by higher trading volumes of 363 TWh.

In 2014, gas sales volumes amounted to 123
TWh. The result of OMV Trading in 2014 showed
a remarkable improvement vs. 2013 despite

the company facing a challenging market
environment. From April 2014 onwards, OMV
Trading started to market equity gas from the
Gudrun field, in addition to the Gullfaks volumes,
through wholesale and trading activities in

the following market areas: TTF (Title Transfer
Facility, Netherlands), NCG (Net Connect
Germany), Gaspool (Germany) and NBP (National
Balancing Point, United Kingdom). Market access
was provided via existing pipeline systems to
the Dutch and German gas markets as well as
OMV storage assets in Germany. The gas sales
business marketed gas to industrial customers,
local distribution companies and wholesalers with
a focus on multi-country customers.

The result of EconGas in 2014 improved slightly
vs. 2013 despite the unusually warm weather
during the winter season and a more challenging
market environment due to declining demand
and increasing competition. During 2014,
EconGas successfully continued the restructuring
process started in 2013. The new long-term
agreement with Gazprom and the optimized
management of the storage and transport
portfolio will improve competitiveness in the
future. Moreover, EconGas minimized the loss

of the LNG business through re-loads and in-tank
deals. With operations in Austria, Germany,

Italy, Hungary, Croatia and on international
trading hubs, EconGas reached total gas sales
and trading volumes of 318 TWh (down by 7%
compared to 2013), consisting of 261 TWh trading
volumes and 58 TWh sales volumes.


--- Page 16 ---

In Romania, OMV Petrom gas sales decreased
by 9% in the context of an overall decline

in estimated Romanian gas demand by 4%.

This was mainly driven by an adverse market
environment which resulted in lower extraction
and higher injection into storages vs. 2013. The
reduced off-take by heat and power plants was
only partly compensated by higher sales to

the chemical industry. In terms of gas market
liberalization, the roadmap enforced by the
government for the gradual increase of regulated
domestic gas prices during 2013-2014 has been
partly implemented. The regulated domestic gas
price for non-household consumers has been
kept at the level of April 1, 2014, of RON 89.4/MWh
until the end of 2014, when the price liberalization
for non-household consumers was completed.
The regulated domestic gas price increase for
household consumers scheduled for October 1,
2014 was delayed, with RON 53.3/MWh remaining
in effect until the end of the year. In compliance
with a new obligation in force as of July 15, 2014,
gas producers were required to sell parts of their
production on the centralized, domestic market.
In 2014, OMV Petrom was the first company
which sold natural gas on the Romanian
Commodities Exchange (BRM), one of the two
operating trading platforms alongside OPCOM.

In Turkey, natural gas sales and domestic LNG
sales volumes increased by 23% to 15 TWh in
2014. Despite the increasing volumes in natural
gas sales, the gas business in Turkey was
burdened due to the aforementioned unfavorable
USD-TRY FX-rate development. Furthermore,
power market entry activities were performed
within an asset-backed trading strategy, which
hedges OMV power assets within a single
portfolio.

Power

The power business continued to provide an
additional marketing platform for gas to OMV.
The gas-fired Samsun power plant adds 870 MW
of low carbon, efficient and reliable power supply
to the Turkish market. The gas-fired Brazi power
plant (860 MW) continued to provide low carbon

power to the Romanian market, underlining its
importance for the national energy system as a
flexible and reliable supplier with fast response
times. The 45 MW wind park Dorobantu in
Romania has delivered renewable power to the
market. All planned outages were completed
ahead of schedule and were performed without
any HSSE incidents. In total, net electrical output
stood at 5.81 TWh in 2014, mainly coming from
the Samsun power plant. A challenging market
environment in Romania led to a negative

the Brazi power plant. The Samsun power plant
performed well in its first full year of operation.
Due to the high flexibility of the plant, balancing
and ancillary services revenues contributed
strongly to a good result. Both gas-fired power
plants achieved an availability performance
which is in the top quartile of the industry.

Refining and Marketing including petrochemicals

The business segment Refining and Marketing including petrochemicals (R&M) refines, supplies

and trades oil products and petrochemicals with a geographical focus on Central and Southeastern
Europe as well as Turkey. R&M operates refineries in Schwechat (Austria) and Burghausen (Southern
Germany), both with integrated petrochemical complexes, as well as the Petrobrazi (Romania)
refinery, and holds a 36% stake in the petrochemical company Borealis. At the end of 2014, OMV had
an annual crude oil processing capacity of 17.4 mn t (360,000 bbi/d). The retail network consists of

High quality approximately 4,100 filling stations in 11 countries, with a strong brand portfolio: “OMV”, operating
integrated asset _ in all countries except Turkey and Moldova, “Petrom” in Romania and Moldova, “Petrol Ofisi”
portfolio in Turkey and “Avanti” in Austria. With a high-quality integrated asset portfolio, strong brands,

industry-leading availability and utilization rates, OMV has an advantageous position in its markets.

Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE)
R&M’s top priority is to operate with no incidents
that could cause injury to our employees or
contractors and is thereby striving to achieve
OMV’s HSSE Vision “ZERO Harm — NO Losses”.
We continuously work to improve our HSSE
processes and procedures, simultaneously
focussing on the effectiveness of the implemented
measures. We constantly aim to strengthen

the safety culture amongst our employees and
contractors. Unfortunately, R&M reported one
work-related fatality in 2014. The Lost-Time Injury
Rate (LTIR) for both employees and contractors
increased to 0.38 in 2014 from 0.25 in 2013.

Financial performance

At EUR 503 mn, clean CCS EBIT increased by
9%, driven by a significantly higher OMV
indicator refining margin and despite the slightly
lower refinery utilization rate as a consequence
of shutdowns in all our three refineries. Net
special items of EUR (342) mn, mainly as a result
of the impairment of goodwill related to the
Petrol Ofisi acquisition, were recognized in 2014.
Falling crude prices over the year contributed to
negative CCS effects of EUR (452) mn, which

led to a reported EBIT of EUR (290) mn. The
refining result increased compared to 2013,
mainly due to a strong increase in the OMV
indicator refining margin as a result of lower
costs for own crude consumption as well as the
adaptation of the standard yield in Petrobrazi
following the completion of the modernization
program, and despite higher costs in relation to
shutdowns during the year. The OMV indicator
refining margin of USD 3.28/bbl increased

by 69%. At 89%, overall refining utilization in
2014 decreased compared to the level of 92%
in 2013, as there have been major planned
shutdowns in Burghausen, Petrobrazi and
Schwechat. The clean petrochemicals EBIT
increased to EUR 148 mn (vs. EUR 140 mn

in 2013) mainly due to substantially higher
propylene and benzene margins, which more
than compensated for lower ethylene margins
as well as lower sales volumes (down by 10%
compared to the previous year). The clean
marketing result was lower compared to 2013,
mainly reflecting the negative effects from the
ongoing margin ceiling in Turkey and despite
better cost management. Marketing sales
volumes were down by 5%.

Refining and petrochemicals

The successful completion of the refinery
modernization program in Petrobrazi, the further
petrochemical integration in the refineries
Schwechat and Burghausen as well as the
TUV-safety shutdown in Burghausen are only
some of the highlights in 2014. Generally, a clear
focus was placed on further strengthening the
overall competitiveness of OMV’s refineries by
continuously increasing cross-site and cross-
business integration. This also addresses the
challenging market environment by further
improving cost and performance management
as well as the product portfolio towards high-
value products.

To strengthen the petrochemical integration

and to meet market requirements, the existing
butadiene plant in the Schwechat refinery was
successfully expanded in May 2014 by 30% to

a total capacity of approximately 60,000 tons per
year. Additionally, the progress of the greenfield
butadiene plant in Burghausen is well on track
and expected start-up as planned in 2015, with

a total capacity of approximately 70,000 tons
per year. Butadiene is a key feedstock for the
chemical industry and is mainly used in the
automotive sector.

The Petrobrazi modernization program,
started in 2010 to optimize the yield structure
and to improve energy efficiency, was
successfully completed in 2014. With a total
investment of around EUR 600 mn, OMV
Petrom is now able to process all domestic
equity crude oil production in its refinery.
The investment in crude oil distillation,
diesel hydrotreating, fluid catalytic cracking,
coker unit and related infrastructure, serves
to increase middle distillate yield up to

approximately 45% and reduces energy
consumption by approximately 25% against
2009.

Overall, the refinery utilization rate reached

89% compared to 92% in 2013. The lower
utilization rate was mainly driven by the planned
turnaround at the refinery Burghausen. In
Petrobrazi, the utilization rate was 89% (2013:
90%), despite the planned downtimes due to

the finalization of the Petrobrazi modernization
program. Petrobrazi
modernization
In June 2014, OMV closed the sale of its program
45% share in the German Bayernoil refinery
network to Varo Energy B.V. The sale marks the
finalization of the planned reduction in OMV's
total annual refinery capacity by 4.6 mnt to
17.4 mn t. With the remaining three refineries —
Schwechat, Burghausen and Petrobrazi - OMV
has reached its target structure in refining and
all sites are highly integrated into crude and/or
petrochemicals with the associated competitive
advantages in OMV’s core markets.

Borealis

In 2014, Borealis weathered the overall
challenging market environment well and
delivered a strong net profit contribution. This
was mainly driven by stronger margins in the
olefin and polyolefin business, partly offset

by a somewhat weaker performance on the
fertilizer side due to operational challenges at
the newly acquired plants in France. Borouge,
Borealis’ joint venture with the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Company (ADNOC) improved

its contribution to Borealis’ performance,
following the gradual start-up of the Borouge
3 project since the middle of the year. After the
successful start-up of the cracker in June, three
out of five polyolefin plants started up in the
period until year-end. When fully ramped-up,
Borouge 3 will increase the annual production
capacity of the integrated petrochemical site
from 2 mnt to 4.5 mnt, making it the biggest
integrated polyolefin complex in the world.
Borealis’ strategy of growing in the polyolefin
business whilst maintaining its competitiveness
continued successfully with increasing long-

term feedstock flexibility for its petrochemical
plant in Stenungsund, Sweden. Borealis signed
a long-term agreement to source ethane from
the North Sea as well as the US. The US ethane
sourcing project involves huge investments

for cracker upgrade and to construct an ethane
storage tank. In addition, the growth was
underpinned by the acquisition of Speciality
Polymers Antwerp N.V., located in Zwijndrecht,
Belgium.

Borealis continued to expand its position

in Brazil, South America, by investing in its
Itatiba complex near Sao Paulo, thus allowing
Borealis to better exploit growth opportunities
in pioneering applications in the automotive and
appliance industries. 2014 also marked a year of
consolidation for Borealis, continuing to work
on integrating previous acquisitions, including

Marketing

Despite weak demand and higher pump prices
in most markets, OMV maintained market share
in the retail business, driven by increasing
efficiency as a result of both the integration
within downstream activities and asset portfolio
optimization.

In 2014, a clear focus of the retail business
was on the premium fuel strategy, which led
to strengthening MaxxMotion as a leading
premium fuel brand. With this effort, the
MaxxMotion product (MaxxMotion Super 100,
MaxxMotion Diesel) volume share could be
increased significantly by more than 10%
compared to the previous year. We continue



--- Page 20 ---

to pursue our two-brand strategy in Austria
which positions OMV retail stations as the
premium brand alongside Avanti unmanned
retail stations as a discount brand. This
successful strategy has led to another year of
strong sales performance for the Avanti brand,
whilst the OMV brand has remained stable. As
a result, additional unmanned sites have been
added to the network and the overall market
share increased in Austria. A turnaround and
optimization initiative regarding approximately
500 sites at the tail end of the filling station
network was already started in 2013. The target
to improve on previous years’ profitability

was achieved and contributed considerably

to the overall strong retail result. In Hungary,

a filling station cooperation with Spar, which
was already started at three sites in 2013, was
thoroughly analyzed. The decision was taken to
further roll-out the concept to additional filling
stations. In 2014, OMV Group improved the
average throughput per retail station compared
to the previous year level, with increases in
Austria, Hungary, Slovenia and Turkey. Due

to effective cost management, the overall
distribution costs per liter were decreased

by 5% compared to the previous year. A

major contribution to cost savings arose from
continued investment into LED technology,
reducing energy consumption sustainably.

Within the supply and logistics area, the main
activity was the divestment of OMV's 45%
stake in the Bayernoil refinery network near
Ingolstadt, Germany, which was closed on
June 30, 2014. This made it necessary to adapt
and re-optimize previous supply patterns,
logistics operations and terminal management
in alignment with our business partners.

The volumes in the commercial business

were lower, driven by the sale of Bayernoil.
Despite this, through a combination of strong
customer focus, active price management and
cost discipline a profit contribution similar to
previous years was achieved. In Romania,
focus was on successful supply chain
preparation and management of the 30 day
turnaround in June at the Petrobrazi refinery.

Securing the constant supply to the entire OMV
Petrom network of filling stations, customers
and terminals was successfully managed. The
modernization of the fuels terminal Bacau,
supplying the northeastern part of Romania,
was a significant step in completing the
terminal network optimization program of
OMV Petrom.

Following rapid economic growth in recent
years, Turkey experienced a difficult economic
environment in 2014 with a more modest
growth rate, impacted by elections and

high political instabilities in the neighboring
countries. In 2014, the Turkish Energy Market
Regulatory Authority (EMRA) intervened by
introducing a margin ceiling which negatively
impacts Petrol Ofisi’s profitability. Under

these economic circumstances, Petrol Ofisi
achieved lower operating results compared to
2013. Nevertheless, Petrol Ofisi has remained
the market leader and further increased its
market share in white products (gasoline,
diesel) as compared to 2013. Growth mainly
came from increased retail sales, additional
supply contracts for new infrastructure projects
(e.g. supply contract for the third Istanbul
airport construction) and new commercial
customers. The aviation business of Petrol Ofisi
significantly increased its financial performance
and the lubricants business kept its market
leadership in a very competitive market for the
fifth consecutive year. Petrol Ofisi continued
the efforts to improve its added value services
to retail customers through a new cooperation
with one of the biggest chains of supermarkets
in Turkey (Migros). By the end of 2014, 43 Petrol
Ofisi retail sites were running Migros Jet shops.
As a result of sustainable volume increases,

the average retail site throughput increased by
10%. Leveraging OMV Group supply synergies,
Petrol Ofisi optimized its supply program

and took advantage of its superior terminal
infrastructure.

OMV generated an operating result of

EUR 1,054 mn in 2014, 59% below last year’s
level, burdened by a lower R&M result due to the
impairment in Petrol Ofisi in Turkey, a lower E&P
result mainly driven by lower oil prices and the
impairment of Tasbulat assets in Kazakhstan, as
well as a lower G&P result due to the impairments
of the Brazi power plant in Romania and the
goodwill related to the Petrol Ofisi acquisition.
Net special items of EUR (822) mn (2013:

EUR 31 mn) were mainly related to impairments
of Petrol Ofisi, the Brazi power plant (Romania)
and E&P assets in Kazakhstan. The net financial
result of EUR (177) mn was above that in 2013
(EUR (311) mn) mainly driven by a better foreign
exchange result. The Group recognized current
taxes on income of EUR (515) mn and deferred

2014 was a challenging year for the business
segment Exploration and Production (E&P). Total
production in mature core countries (Romania
and Austria) was kept at a stable level in line with
the strategic target of 200-210 kboe/d. Production
in Romania showed a second year of marginal
growth. Norway's production ramp-up to

50 kboe/d towards the end of the year is a strong
indicator that the North Sea region is becoming
a core area for the Group. In contrast, the rest

of the international portfolio was impacted by
production interruptions in Libya and Yemen
due to security issues. From an exploration

point of view, 2014 was a less successful year
with an overall success rate significantly below
previous years. This year’s discoveries were
made onshore and offshore Romania, while in
Norway the Wisting discovery was successfully
appraised. In Abu Dhabi, Namibia, Gabon and
Bulgaria large license areas were covered by 3D
seismic.

For Gas and Power (G&P), the overall

market environment remained challenging,
nevertheless, key decisions were taken in 2014
to increase profitability. The supply, marketing
and trading business renegotiated the long-
term gas supply contract with Gazprom and


--- Page 22 ---

agreed on a structural solution which reflects
changing market conditions. In turn, the same
business unit started marketing Norwegian
equity gas volumes. The gas logistics business
successfully finalized the consolidation of the gas
transportation business in Austria.

The business segment Refining and Marketing
including petrochemicals (R&M) refines, supplies
and trades oil products and petrochemicals
with a geographical focus on Central and
Southeastern Europe as well as Turkey. R&M
operates refineries in Schwechat (Austria) and
Burghausen (Southern Germany), both with
integrated petrochemical complexes, as well

as the Petrobrazi (Romania) refinery, and holds
a 36% stake in the petrochemical company
Borealis. At the end of 2014, OMV had an
annual crude oil processing capacity of 17.4 mn
t (360,000 bbl/d). The retail network consists

of approximately 4,100 filling stations in 11
countries, with a strong brand portfolio: “OMV”,
operating in all countries except Turkey and
Moldova, “Petrom” in Romania and Moldova,
“Petrol Ofisi” in Turkey and “Avanti” in Austria.
With a high-quality integrated asset portfolio,
strong brands, industry-leading availability and
utilization rates, OMV has an advantageous
position in its markets.

Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)

E&P EBIT decreased by 26% to EUR 1,466 mn, in
spite of the production from Norway (production
included since November 2013), which was more
than offset by higher depreciation, increased
production costs and lower oil prices. Total

OMV daily production of oil, NGL and gas of

309 kboe/d was 8% above the level of 2013, as
Norway’s contribution was fully reflected in

2014 and more than offset the lower production
volumes in Libya, due to security issues in the
country. Total OMV daily oil and NGL production
rose by 5%, mainly reflecting the contribution
from Norway, which more than offset the lower
volumes from Libya. Total OMV daily gas
production increased by 10% vs. 2013, mainly
supported by the contribution from Norway and
the increase in volumes in Pakistan and Romania.

Driven mainly by the liftings in Norway, the total
sales volumes increased by 12%. Net special
items of EUR (203) mn in 2014 were mainly
related to the impairment of the Tasbulat assets
in Kazakhstan.

G&P EBIT decreased from EUR 1 mn in 2013

to EUR (162) mn, due to net special items of

EUR (263) mn, mainly related to the impairment
of the gas-fired power plant Brazi in Romania and
the impairment of goodwill related to the Petrol
Ofisi acquisition.

The result of the business unit supply, marketing
and trading decreased mainly due to lower
results in Romania and in Turkey. The weak
gas market environment and warm weather
conditions led to a decrease of gas sales volumes
in EconGas as well as in Romania. Increased
competition resulted in an overall lower level

of gas sales margins. The result contribution

of EconGas was at last year’s level, supported
by the adjusted long-term gas supply contracts
but weighed down by the cost of the unutilized
regasification capacity in the Gate LNG terminal.
In Romania, gas sales volumes decreased

by 9% to 47.70 TWh (2013: 52.70 TWh) in the
context of the overall gas market decline of

4%, impacted also by less off-take by power
plants. The gas sales margin in Romania was
negatively impacted by additional storage

prices. In addition, 2013 included the result
from the sale of LMG Lagermanagement GmbH
(EUR 440 mn).

The refining result decreased substantially
compared to 2013 mainly due to the sharp
decline in prices at year end, in addition to higher
costs in relation to the planned turnaround in
Burghausen and the shutdown of Petrobrazi for
the finalization of the modernization program.
These effects could not be compensated by the
increase in the OMV indicator refining margin
as a result of the Petrobrazi modernization
program that led to an optimization of the yield
structure. The OMV indicator refining margin
of USD 3.28/bbl increased by 69% compared to
the level of 2013, which was USD 1.94/bbl.

Increased and transportation costs. In Turkey, OMV sold The petrochemicals result increased mainly due
petrochemicals 14.70 TWh of natural gas and LNG in 2014 vs. to substantially higher propylene and benzene
result 11.96 TWh in 2013. Due to the unfavorable margins, which more than compensated for lower

USD-TRY FX-rate development in 2014, the gas
business in Turkey was burdened as the supply
volumes were purchased in USD, whereas the
sales price for wholesalers and local consumers
were in TRY and heavily influenced by the local
market leader.

The business unit gas logistics recorded a slightly
lower result vs. 2013. The gas transportation
business result came in below last year’s level
mainly due to the restructuring of the TAG
pipeline operations.

The power business recorded a net electrical
output of 5.81 TWh vs. 4.34 TWh in 2013, mainly
from the increased output of the gas-fired power
plant Samsun (Turkey), which started operations
in June 2013. The output of the gas-fired power
plant Brazi (Romania) decreased significantly.
The result of the power business was burdened
by unfavorable market conditions in Romania.

R&M EBIT came in at EUR (290) mn, significantly
lower than the EUR 658 mn in 2013, based on
net special items of EUR (342) mn, mainly as a
result of the impairment of goodwill related to
the Petrol Ofisi acquisition, and the falling crude

58 | OMVAnnual Report 2014 | Directors’ report

ethylene margins as well as lower sales volumes.
The marketing result was lower compared to
2013, mainly reflecting the negative effects from
the ongoing margin ceiling in Turkey and despite
better cost management in both the retail and
the commercial business. The marketing sales
volumes were 5% lower than 2013, mainly due
to the missing volumes after the sale of the 45%
stake in the Bayernoil refinery network and the
sale of the marketing businesses in Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

EBIT in the Corporate and Other (Co&O) segment
decreased by 19% to EUR (63) mn in 2014.

Notes to the income statement

OMV is an integrated, international oil and gas
company. As oil produced by the E&P business
segment is either processed at Group refineries
or —in large part - marketed by R&M (OMV
Supply & Trading AG), the R&M business
segment represents the largest share of the
Group’s consolidated sales. The volatility in the
main factors affecting profitability — crude oil
prices and USD exchange rates — may cause
considerable swings in sales and cost of sales,
and the impact on earnings is therefore difficult
to predict.

Compared to 2013, consolidated sales revenues
decreased by 15% to EUR 35,913 mn, mainly
driven by lower sales in G&P. Sales of the

E&P business segment increased by 7% to

EUR 5,773 mn. After the elimination of intra-group
transactions of EUR 4,284 mn, the contribution
of E&P to consolidated sales revenues was

EUR 1,489 mn or about 4% of the Group’s total
sales revenues (2013: EUR 1,043 mn or 2%).
G&P sales decreased to EUR 6,799 mn (2013:
EUR 12,236 mn). After elimination of intra-group
sales to refineries, G&P’s contribution in 2014
was 18% of total sales or EUR 6,632 mn (2013:
EUR 12,035 mn or 28%). Consolidated sales in
R&M amounted to EUR 27,787 mn or 77% of
total sales (2013: EUR 29,330 mn or 69%).

Sales to external customers are split up by
geographical areas on the basis of where

the delivery of goods or services is effective.
Austria retained its position as the Group’s
most important geographical market with sales
of EUR 9,005 mn or 25% of the Group’s total
(2013: EUR 14,064 mn or 33%). Sales revenues in
Germany decreased from EUR 8,241 mn in 2013
to EUR 6,260 mn in 2014, representing a revenue
contribution of 17% (2013: 19%), mainly as a
result of the Bayernoil divestment. In Romania,
sales revenues of EUR 3,809 mn or 11% of total
sales revenues, were close to last year’s level

in terms of proportion (2013: EUR 4,170 mn or
10%). Turkey enlarged its supply business and
managed to raise its contribution to 23%, or
EUR 8,235 mn, to OMV Group’s total sales in
2014 (2013: EUR 6,699 mn or 16%). Sales in the
rest of CEE were EUR 3,779 mn or 11% of Group
sales revenues (2013: EUR 3,993 mn or 9%).
Rest of Europe accounted for EUR 1,957 mn or
5% (2013: EUR 2,625 mn or 6%). Sales revenues
in the Rest of the World increased slightly to
EUR 2,867 mn, representing 8% of total sales
revenues (2013: EUR 2,622 mn or 6%).

Sales in Turkey rose

Direct selling expenses, mainly consisting of
third-party freight-out expenses, remained

production costs as well as costs of goods

and materials employed, decreased by 14%

to EUR (32,504) mn. Other operating income
declined to EUR 314 mn (2013: EUR 705 mn).
The decrease compared to 2013 is mainly
related to the sale of LMG Lagermanagement
GmbH in the amount of EUR 440 mn, which was
reflected in the previous year figure.

Selling and administrative expenses
amounting in total to EUR (1,366) mn decreased
by 3% compared to last year, mainly related

to divestment activities in R&M (2013:

EUR (1,407) mn).

Exploration expenses amounting to EUR (460) mn
decreased by 10% compared to last year, mainly
driven by write-offs of exploration licenses in the
Kurdistan Region of Iraq and higher write-offs of
exploration wells in Norway in 2013. Research
and development (R&D) expenses increased by
48% to EUR (25) mn.

Other operating expenses decreased by 11%

compared to 2013, amounting to EUR (476) mn.
The 2013 figure included an impairment loss of
the German Bayernoil refinery network and the

related business following the reclassification to
held for sale.

The net financial result amounted to

EUR (177) mn (2013: EUR (311) mn). The
improvement compared to last year was mainly
related to an improved foreign exchange result.
Income from equity-accounted investments

in total amounted to EUR 180 mn (2013:

EUR 170 mn) and reflected mainly the share of
the pro rata result of Borealis group amounting
to EUR 205 mn (2013: EUR 152 mn). Dividend
income amounted to EUR 16 mn (2013:

EUR 11 mn). The net interest result showed

an expense balance of EUR (330) mn (2013:
EUR (237) mn), mainly reflecting late payment
interest charges following a tax review of the
years 2009 and 2010 of OMV Petrom SA, partly
compensated by lower interest expenses due
to the improved financing structure.

Taxes on income were EUR (264) mn (2013:

EUR (562) mn). Current income tax expenses
amounted to EUR (515) mn (2013: EUR (693) mn)
and deferred tax income amounted to EUR 251 mn
(2013: EUR 131 mn). The Group’s effective tax
rate increased to 30% (2013: 25%).

Capital expenditure (CAPEX)
CAPEX decreased to EUR 3,832 mn (2013:
EUR 5,239 mn).

E&P invested EUR 2,951 mn (2013: EUR 4,431 mn)
mainly in field redevelopments, drilling and
workover activities in Romania, and field
developments in Norway and the UK. CAPEX
in the G&P business segment of EUR 243 mn
(2013: EUR 270 mn) was mainly related to the
gas storage Etzel in Germany. CAPEX in the
R&M segment amounted to EUR 607 mn (2013:
EUR 506 mn), mainly comprising investments
in the construction of the butadiene plant in
Burghausen (Germany) and the modernization
of the Petrobrazi refinery (Romania). CAPEX

in the Co&O segment was EUR 31 mn (2013:

The reconciliation of total capital expenditure to
additions according to the statement of non-
current assets (intangible and tangible) mainly
relates to changes in the group of consolidated
companies and additions, which by definition are
not considered to be capital expenditure, as well
as investments in financial assets. The difference
between the additions shown in the statement of
non-current assets and the investments reported
in the cash flow statement partly arise from
investments in intangible and tangible assets
that did not affect cash flows during the period
(including liabilities arising from investments,
new finance leases, decommissioning and
capitalized borrowing costs). In addition, cash
outflows due to investments in financial assets
are included in the overall investments shown in
the cash flow statement.

network

Statement of financial position

Total assets increased by EUR 2,090 mn to
EUR 33,938 mn. The increase in non-current
assets amounting to EUR 1,907 mn was to

a large extent related to investment activities
in intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment, which mainly included E&P.
investments in OMV Petrom, field developments
in Norway and the UK and investments in the
refineries in Germany and Romania, partly
compensated by the impairments recognized
during the year and the regular depreciation,
depletion and amortization.

Equity-accounted investments increased by
EUR 278 mn. Changes of equity-accounted
investments included the result contribution of
Borealis as well as the proportional results from
other equity-accounted investments, translation
of foreign operations and other changes. Other
non-current assets, which primarily comprise
non-current receivables, loans and securities,
increased by EUR 185 mn to EUR 933 mn.

Deferred tax assets increased to EUR 456 mn.

Current assets increased by EUR 735 mn and
amounted to EUR 8,298 mn as at December

31, 2014. The volatility of the oil price led to
higher level of derivatives being the main
reason for the EUR 1,188 mn increase in other
current assets. On the other hand, inventories
decreased by EUR 225 mn and trade receivables
by EUR 229 mn mainly triggered by reduced
business activities as a consequence of the
Bayernoil divestment.

Current assets held for sale decreased by

EUR 551 mn, mainly due to the sale of the 45%
stake in the German Bayernoil refinery network
and the related business, partially compensated
by the reclassification of certain assets in the
Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

Equity (including non-controlling interest)
remained stable, whereas the equity ratio
decreased slightly to 43% (2013: 46%).

62 | OMV Annual Report 2014 | Directors’ report

Pensions and similar obligations increased by
EUR 94 mn. Non-current decommissioning and
restoration obligations rose by EUR 384 mn,
mainly due to reassessment of the provisions,
primarily resulting from decreased interest rates.

Current and non-current bonds and other
interest-bearing debts increased by EUR 345 mn,
mainly due to the issuance of a new EUR 750 mn
Eurobond and the increase in short-term
financing, partly compensated by repayments
made during the period.

Trade payables decreased by EUR 584 mn,
mainly due to the divestment of the Bayernoil
refinery and due to lower oil prices. Current and
non-current other provisions and other liabilities
increased by EUR 2,023 mn. The increase was
driven to a large extent by the EUR 1,469 mn
increase in other financial liabilities mainly

due to a higher balance of derivatives primarily
caused by the decline in oil prices. Other effects
came from higher provisions for alleged late
payment interest charges following a tax review
of the years 2009 and 2010 of OMV Petrom SA,
and higher finance lease liabilities.

Deferred tax liabilities decreased to EUR 568 mn.
Gearing ratio

As of December 31, 2014, short- and long-
term borrowings, bonds and financial

leases amounted to EUR 5,551 mn (2013:

EUR 5,076 mn), while cash and cash equivalents
decreased to EUR 649 mn (2013: EUR 705 mn)

in total. On November 10, 2014, OMV issued a
EUR 750 mn Eurobond with a coupon of 0.6%
and a maturity date of November 19, 2018. Net
debt increased by EUR 531 mn to EUR 4,902 mn
(2013: EUR 4,371 mn). At December 31, 2014,
the gearing ratio, defined as net debt divided

by equity, was 34% (2013: 30%). This reflects
the increase of short-term financing and finance
leases.

Cash flow

The Group’s cash flow statement is prepared
using the indirect method, whereby adjustments
are made for changes in the group of
consolidated companies, foreign exchange
differences and other non-cash transactions.

Cash flow from operating activities decreased
by EUR 457 mn or 11% from EUR 4,124 mn

to EUR 3,666 mn. The reconciliation of net
income for the year to the cash flow from
operating activities (before changes in working
capital components) resulted in a net upward
adjustment of EUR 2,648 mn for 2014 (2013:
EUR 1,748 mn). The adjustment for depreciation,
amortization and impairments was EUR 3,058 mn
(2013: EUR 2,296 mn) and EUR (251) mn (2013:
EUR (131) mn) for deferred taxes. The current
tax expense less net tax payments resulted in a
decrease of EUR 54 mn (2013: EUR 3 mn). The
share of equity-accounted investments’ result
and other dividend income less the dividend
payments received contributed to a decrease of
EUR 153 mn (2013: EUR 147 mn). The net interest
expenses related to loans and other liabilities less
interest paid resulted in a decrease of EUR 46 mn
(2013: EUR 26 mn). The net decrease in long-term
provisions (including employee benefits and
decommissioning and restoration obligations)
resulted in a negative cash flow adjustment

of EUR 14 mn (2013: EUR 38 mn). The total of
write-ups of fixed assets and other non-cash
items resulted in an increase of EUR 102 mn
(2013: decrease of EUR 209 mn). Other non-cash
items included among others the write-down

of inventories related to the significant decline
in prices at year end. In 2013, this position

also reflected the gain from the sale of LMG
Lagermanagement GmbH.

In 2014, there was a cash inflow from working
capital components of EUR 405 mn (2013:

EUR 647 mn). Receivables and inventories
decreased by EUR 455 mn (2013: EUR 116 mn),
the positive effect was mainly related to lower
crude quantities in OMV Germany as a result of
the Bayernoil divestment. Liabilities decreased

by EUR 135 mn (2013: increase of EUR 536 mn).
Short-term provisions increased by EUR 85 mn
(2013: decrease of EUR 5 mn). The higher
contribution from working capital components
in 2013 is mainly a result of one-off effects from
working capital improvement measures initially
implemented in 2013. These measures were
continued in 2014 but with a lower impact.

Cash outflows for investments in non-current
assets of EUR 3,910 mn (2013: EUR 4,816 mn)
were partly offset by proceeds from the sale of
non-current assets, subsidiaries and businesses,
net of cash disposed, amounting to EUR 516 mn
(2013: EUR 835 mn), mainly related to the

sale of the 45% stake in the Bayernoil refinery
network and to other divestments. In 2013, LMG
Lagermanagement GmbH, a company which
holds and manages a major part of R&M’s
Austrian emergency stocks was sold. Net cash
outflow from investment activities totaled

EUR 3,394 mn (2013: EUR 3,981 mn).

Cash inflows from the net increase of short-
term and long-term borrowings amounted

to EUR 331 mn (2013: EUR 120 mn). In 2014,
there were EUR 750 mn cash inflows from the
issuance of a new Eurobond, compensated by
the EUR 702 mn repayment of a Eurobond in
April. In 2013, the Group issued a new Eurobond
with a nominal value of EUR 500 mn, which

was compensated by the EUR 138 mn partial
repayment of a US Capital Market bond. In 2014,
the Group acquired additional stake of 1.8% in
OMV Petrol Ofisi A.S. and the remaining non-
controlling interest in Adria-Wien Pipeline GmbH.
In 2013, the Group acquired the non-controlling
stake of 49% in Baumgarten-Oberkappel
Gasleitungsgesellschaft m.b.H. and exercised the
put options held by Oberésterreichische Ferngas
Aktiengesellschaft that led to an increase of
OMV's indirect stake in EconGas GmbH, partly
compensated by the decrease in the stake held
in Austrian Gas Grid Management AG. Cash
outflows for dividend payments amounted

to EUR 650 mn (2013: EUR 627 mn), of which
EUR 408 mn (2013: EUR 391 mn) were paid

Risk management

OMYV is an integrated, international oil and

gas company. Its operations extend from
hydrocarbon exploration and production and
processing through to trading and marketing
of mineral products and gas. Furthermore,
OMV is operating two gas-fired power plants,
in Romania and in Turkey. In common with the
entire oil and gas industry, OMV is exposed to a
variety of risks —- including market, operational,
strategic, regulatory, financial and political as
well as hazard risks. It is OMV’s view that the
Group’s overall risk is significantly reduced due
to its substantial diversification and the related,
partially offsetting effects of different risks. The
balancing effects of offsetting industry risks,
however, often lag or can weaken. Therefore,
OMV’‘s risk management activities focus on the
group-wide net risk exposure of the existing and
future portfolio. The areas of risk management
and insurance are centrally coordinated within
the Corporate Finance department, which
ensures that well-defined and consistent risk
management processes, tools and techniques
are applied across the entire organization.

The overall objective of the risk policy is to
safeguard the cash flows required by the Group
and to maintain a strong investment grade credit
rating in line with the Group’s risk appetite.

New business strategies and the associated

risks are also monitored with respect to rating
implications. Financial risks (e.g. market prices,
currencies) are reviewed quarterly by the
Financial Risk Committee. A cross functional
committee with senior management members of
OMV Group - the Risk Committee - ensures that
an Enterprise Wide Risk Management (EWRM)
program is in place to effectively manage the
integrated risks across the OMV Group.

64 | OMV Annual Report 2014 | Directors’ report

EWR\M is continuously enhanced. The main
purpose is to deliver value through risk-based
management decision making. Thorough
assessment of financial, operational and strategic
risks should support the exploitation of business
opportunities in a systematic manner in order to
ensure sustainable growth in OMV’s value. Since
2003, the EWRM system has helped to enhance
risk awareness and risk management skills across
the entire organization, including subsidiaries in
more than 20 countries.

The risk culture is supported by an IT application
facilitating the risk management processes
established within OMV Group: risk identification,
risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk treatment,
reporting and risk reviewing through continuous
surveillance of changes to the risk profile.
Overall risk resulting from the bottom-up risk
management process is computed with the aid of
Monte Carlo simulations and compared against
planning data. This is further combined with

a senior management view from a top-down
approach to capture the strategic risks. Reports
on the findings of the EWRM process, together
with risk reports from material associated
companies, are submitted to the Executive Board
and to the Audit Committee twice a year. In
compliance with the Austrian Code of Corporate
Governance, the effectiveness of the EWRM
system is evaluated by the external auditor

on an annual basis. The key non-financial and
financial risks identified in respect of OMV’s
medium-term plan are market price risks, political
risks, regulatory and compliance risks, business
process risks, foreign exchange risks (particularly
relating to the USD, RON, NOK and TRY), project
risks, personnel risks as well as hazard risks.

Although OMV has extensive experience in the
political environment in CEE and SEE and in

its core oil and gas production areas, political
developments in all markets where OMV
operates are kept under constant observation.
Furthermore, country-specific risks are assessed
before entering new countries. Risks related

to the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS)


--- Page 30 ---

are separately recorded, aggregated for the
Group as a whole, and monitored by a group-
wide committee (Carbon Steering Committee)
on an ongoing basis. In particular, the impact

of the revised allocation rules in the EU ETS
from 2013 onwards is being analyzed in detail.
Furthermore, OMV is monitoring emerging
regulations related to climate change in all
operating countries. Through systematic staff
succession and development planning, Corporate
Human Resources plans for suitable managerial
staff to meet future growth requirements in order
to mitigate personnel risks.

Control and mitigation of identified and
assessed risks takes place at all organizational
levels using clearly defined risk policies and
responsibilities. The key Group risks are
governed centrally to ensure the ability to meet
the strategic objectives, through the essence

of corporate directives, including those relating
to health, safety, security and environment,
legal matters and compliance, human resources
and corporate social responsibility, with special
emphasis on human rights and market price
risks.

Analysis and management of financial risks
arising from foreign currencies, interest rates,
commodity prices, counterparties, co, emissions,
liquidity as well as insurable risks are undertaken
in a consolidated way within Corporate Finance.

Market price risk is monitored and analyzed
centrally as to the potential cash flow impact
using a specific risk analysis model that considers
portfolio effects. Results of the risk analysis

are discussed by the Financial Risk Committee
comprising senior management of the business
segments and corporate functions. Proposals
for hedging strategies are submitted to the
Executive Board for approval.

The primary foreign currency risks are related
to RON, USD, TRY and NOK currency exposure.
The Group has a net USD long position, mainly
resulting from sales of oil and gas production.

The effects on cash flows and/or the statement
of financial position (translation risk) as well as
the correlation with the oil price are regularly
monitored. Translation exposure also arises
from consolidation of assets in Romania, Turkey,
Norway and USD functional affiliates.

To balance the Group’s interest rate portfolio,
loans can be converted from fixed to floating
rates and vice versa, according to predefined
rules. The main counterparty credit risks are
assessed, monitored and controlled at Group
and segment level, using predetermined credit
limits for all counterparties, banks and security
providers. The procedures are governed by
guidelines at OMV, OMV Petrom and Petrol Ofisi
level.

Sustainability & HSSE

(Health, Safety, Security, Environment)

At OMV, we have a long tradition of responsibility
towards society and the environment. In 2014,
we embedded sustainability further in our
operations. The OMV sustainability strategy,
“Resourcefulness”, focuses on achieving
profitable growth in a sustainable and responsible
way. Being in the natural resources business,

we see it as our responsibility to secure energy
supply for the present and for the future.

Our Resourcefulness strategy is managed

and overseen by two governance bodies: the
Resourcefulness Executive Team comprises
representatives of each Resourcefulness topic
and business segment and is responsible for
further developing the Resourcefulness
strategy and implementing it into operations;
the Resourcefulness Advisory Board comprises
high-ranking external experts who advise us on
how we can best develop the strategy, as well
as providing feedback on current programs.

In 2014, we continued to make progress in
sustainability. Detailed information on our
performance can be found in the OMV
Sustainability Report. We submit information

to leading sustainability rating agencies such

as oekom, Vigeo, MSCI and Ethibel, and report
according to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).
In 2014, we significantly improved our CDP score
from 81B to 99B and have been included in the
DACH Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI)
as a top performer in the oil and gas sector.

Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE)
are a key value of our business. The physical
and mental well-being and safety of our people,
as well as the integrity of our operating facilities,
are of crucial importance to us. Loss prevention
and proactive risk management are essential

to maintaining OMV’s license to operate. Sadly,
in 2014 there were three work-related fatalities.
We are committed to working hard in order

to create an incident-free environment wherever
we operate following our Vision “ZERO harm —
NO Losses”.

66 | OMV Annual Report 2014 | Directors’ report

We very closely monitored the security situation
and performed orderly evacuations in Libya as
well as in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and we
managed to ensure security of our employees
and business continuity. With regards to our
operations in high-risk countries, we maintain
a close working relationship with our security
intelligence providers, this enables proactive
decisions regarding security protection (e.g.

in Tunisia we detected an increased threat
facing our operations in the southern dessert
and we were quickly able to make appropriate
enhancements to our protective measures).

Key actions in 2014 included:

> Roll-out of computer-based training initiatives
on process safety

> Completion of a Hazardous Substance Project
to assess hazardous substances and develop
training materials for employees and
emergency response staff

> Further increase in participation by
top management in high potential incident
investigations

> Implementation of flaring and venting
reduction projects

> Launch of employee health promotion
campaign, to improve health and build
awareness of the importance of personal care

In 2014, OMV provided 281,952 HSSE training
hours for its employees.

OMV’'s goal is to optimize our processes in order
to use natural resources as efficiently as possible,
and to reduce emissions and discharges. Spill
risk management is a key focus across our
operations.

In 2014, there were seven major hydrocarbon
spills (L3-L5 according to OMV definitions),
totaling 69,924 liters of hydrocarbons spilled.
These were caused by corrosion and, in two
instances, the cause was third-party activities.


--- Page 32 ---

OMV carries out a broad range of incremental
energy efficiency improvements. The key is to
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and
save energy costs. We have programs in place to
drive down energy consumption across all our
operations.

Eco-Innovation

We use our core expertise and technology to
develop alternative energy sources, thereby
creating new business opportunities.

For example, we are investing in second-
generation biofuels and in hydrogen, with a

plan in place together with partners to open

up to 400 hydrogen filling stations in Germany
by 2023. In Austria, we have commenced the
wind2hydrogen project, under which we convert
electricity produced by wind into hydrogen.
Furthermore, we started to convert biomass into
diesel in the Schwechat refinery. In 2014, all tests
were finished and the economics are still under
evaluation. The technology works; still further
efforts need to be made to develop a robust
business case.

In addition to the capital increase, a hybrid
bond with a size of EUR 750 mn was placed
on the market on May 25, 2011. As the
repayment of principal and the payments of
interest are solely at the discretion of OMV,
according to IFRS, the proceeds of the hybrid
bond (less costs of issuance) were fully
treated as equity. The hybrid bears a fixed
interest rate of 6.75% until April 26, 2018,
thereafter a reset fixed rate (to be determined)
until April 26, 2023, and thereafter a floating
interest rate with a 100 basis points step up.
The hybrid bond has no scheduled maturity
date and may be redeemed at the option of
OMV under certain circumstances. OMV has
in particular the right to repay the hybrid
bond at certain dates. In the case of a change
of control, OMV may call the hybrid bond for
redemption or else the applicable interest rate
will be subject to an increase according to the
terms and conditions of the hybrid bond.

At December 31, 2014, no other material
agreements to which OMV is a party are in
place which in case of change of control due
to a takeover offer would come into effect,
be amended or terminated.

There are no agreements between the
Company and members of the Executive
Board and Supervisory Board or employees
regarding the payment of compensation in
the event of a public takeover bid.

The most important elements of the internal
control and risk management system
regarding the accounting process are the
following: Standards for the internal control
system are defined by internal Corporate
Guidelines. Corporate Internal Audit controls
the compliance with these standards through
regular audits, based on the annual audit
plan approved by the audit committee,

or through ad-hoc audits. The results of
those audits are presented to the audit
committee. The establishment of group-

wide standards for the preparation of annual
and interim financial statements by means
of the corporate IFRS Accounting Manual

is also regulated by an internal Corporate
Guideline. The Group uses a comprehensive
risk management system. The essential
processes of the financial reporting system
have been identified and analyzed. For the
main “End-to-end” processes (e.g. Purchase-
to-Pay, Order-to-Cash) group-wide standards
are defined. Based on a rolling time plan,
the implementation and the effectiveness
are being monitored. In addition, the
effectiveness of the risk management system
is regularly evaluated by external auditors.
The results of the evaluation are reported to
the audit committee.

Financial Statements.

Outlook

Mid-term guidance

In order to reflect the significant decline of the
oil price together with the unpredictability of
our Libyan production, we have scaled back

our investment program. The guidance for the
average Group CAPE X for the period 2015-2017
is at approximately EUR 2.5 to 3.0 bn p.a. (the
lower end of the range represents an oil price
assumption of approximately USD 50/bbI going
forward for the next three years) with roughly
80% being directed to Upstream. While we
remain committed to the major projects expected
to contribute to our previously stated 2016
production target of ~400 kboe/d, the changes
to the investment program will inevitably lead
to a delay in reaching this production level.

Our target remains to achieve a broadly neutral
free cash flow after dividends over the medium
term. The revisions to the investment program
support us in this objective. ROACE performance
in the mid-term will be adversely affected by
capital invested in field development projects as
well as by the low oil price. We continue to stay

payout ratio target of 30%).

Market environment

For the year 2015, OMV expects the Brent oil
price to average between USD 50 to 60/bbl. The
Brent-Urals spread is anticipated to stay relatively
tight. The gas market environment is expected

to remain highly challenging. In 2015, refining
margins are expected to come down from the
recent highs, due to still persisting overcapacity
on European markets. In the petrochemical
business, margins are anticipated to remain

at similar levels to 2014. Due to the decreased

oil price, lower product prices are expected to
support the demand in the marketing business.
The marketing business in Turkey will continue to
be negatively affected by regulatory intervention.

CAPEX for 2015 is expected to be in the

range of EUR 2.5 to 2.8 bn. OMV has started a
program to ensure the company’s fitness for a
potentially prolonged low oil price environment
by implementing cost cutting measures and
focusing on capital efficiency.

Upstream

Production interruptions in Libya and to a lesser
extent in Yemen, have impacted our overall
production since political disturbances began
in 2011. Uninterrupted full capacity from these
countries could provide ~43 kboe/d in 2015.
Excluding these two countries, we expect total
production for 2015 to average approximately
300 kboe/d. In Romania and Austria, production
is expected to come in at the lower end of the
targeted production range of 200-210 kboe/d.

In Norway, the combined production from
Gudrun and Gullfaks fields stood at ~35 kboe/d
in 2014 and will further increase as additional
wells at the Gudrun field are expected to come
on stream this year. Following “first oil” at

the Maari Growth project, production in New
Zealand is expected to continue to ramp up

as additional wells are planned to be drilled at
Maari by mid-2015. Upstream capital expenditure
for 2015 is expected to be roughly 80% of total

70 | OMV Annual Report 2014 | Directors’ report

Group CAPEX and includes the following major
investment projects: Gullfaks, Aasta Hansteen,
Edvard Grieg and Gudrun in Norway, field
redevelopments in Romania, Nawara in Tunisia
and Schiehallion in the UK. In the Neptun block
(Romanian Black Sea), drilling at the Domino-2
well was completed in 04/14 and data from the
well is currently being evaluated. The Ocean
Endeavor semisubmersible drilling rig has since
been moved and is currently drilling the Pelican
South-1 exploration well. Further exploration
drilling is planned in 2015. The results from the
Domino-2 and the Pelican South-1 wells, together
with data from additional exploration wells, will
be used for the evaluation of the consolidated
block potential. Exploration and appraisal
expenditure will be around EUR 0.5 bn in 2015.
High impact wells planned for 2015 are expected
to be drilled in Romania (Black Sea), Norway
(Barents Sea and the Norwegian Sea) and West
of Shetland.

Downstream

The review of the gas and power asset portfolio
(including divestment options) will be finalized
in the first half of the year 2015. As announced
in October 2014, a combined business segment
Downstream, integrating the Gas and Power and
Refining and Marketing business segments, is
effective as of January 1, 2015. Detailed analysis
and planning of the integration of the R&M and
G&P businesses into a combined Downstream
segment is being performed with the necessary
restructuring to commence in the second half of
2015.

The optimized asset structure including the
finalized modernization of the Petrobrazi
refinery and the sale of the Bayernoil stake
further enhanced the stable profit and cash
contribution from the refining business, which
will be reflected in the 2015 performance. No
major refinery shutdowns are planned in 2015.
The ongoing regulatory intervention in Turkey
(margin ceiling) together with the volatile
economic development will further negatively
influence Petrol Ofisi’s profitability. Following
agreements with major gas suppliers, the
