Business Overview

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with ArcelorMittal’s consolidated financial statements and
related notes for the year ended December 31, 2012 included in this Annual Report.

Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations

The steel industry, and the iron ore and coal mining industries, which provide its principal raw materials, have historically been
highly cyclical and are affected significantly by general economic conditions, as well as fluctuations in productive capacity utilization
and in changes in steel imports/exports and tariffs. In particular, this is due to the cyclical nature of the automotive, construction,
machinery and equipment and transportation industries that are the principal customers of steel. After a period of continuous growth
between 2004 and 2008, the sharp fall in demand resulting from the 2008-2009 global economic s demonstrated the steel market’s
vulnerability to volatility and sharp corrections. The last quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009 were characterized by a deep slump
in demand, as consumers used up existing inventories rather than buying new stock. The iron ore and steel market began a gradual
recovery in the second half of 2009 that continued in 2010 and the first half of 2011 in line with global economic activity. The iron ore
and steel market experienced renewed weakening in the second half of 2011, as demand decreased due in part to uncertainty
surrounding the Euro-zone sovereign debt crisis and due to significant destocking in the fourth quarter of 2011. Similarly, 2012 was
again characterized by early optimism and restocking but contraction in Europe and a slowdown in China caused iron ore prices to fall
as did then both steel prices and margins. The scope and duration of any recovery in activity is difficult to predict and remait bject
to significant risks, particularly any escalation of the Euro-zone debt crisis.

ArcelorMittal’s sales are predominantly derived from the sale of flat steel products, long steel products and tubular products as
well as of iron ore and coal. Prices of steel products, iron ore and coal, in general, are sensitive to changes in worldwide and local
demand, which, in turn, are affected by worldwide and country-specific economic conditions and available production capacity.

Unlike many commodities, steel is not completely fungible due to wide differences in shape, chemical composition, quality,
specifications and application, all of which impact sales prices. Accordingly, there is limited exchange trading of steel or uniform
pricing, whereas there is increasing trading of steel raw materials, particularly iron ore. Commodity spot prices may vary, and
therefore sales prices from exports fluctuate as a function of the worldwide balance of supply and demand at the time sales are made.
ArcelorMittal’s sales are made on the basis of shorter-term purchase orders as well as some longer term contracts to some industrial
customers, particularly in the automotive industry. Sales of iron ore to external parties amounted to 10.4 million tonnes in 2012. Steel
price surcharges are often implemented on steel sold pursuant to long-term contracts in order to recover increases in input costs.
However, spot market steel, iron ore and coal prices and short-term contracts are driven by market conditions.

One of the principal factors affecting the Company’s operating profitability is the relationship between raw material prices and
steel selling prices. Profitability depends in part on the extent to which steel selling prices exceed raw material prices, and in
particular, the extent to which changes in raw material prices correlate with changes in steel selling prices. Complicating factors
include the extent of the time lag between (a) the raw material price change and the steel selling price change and (b) the date of the
raw material purchase and the actual sale of the steel product in which the raw material was used (average cost basis). In recent
periods, steel selling prices have tended to react quickly to rises in raw material prices, due in part to the tendency of distributors to
increase purc s of steel products early in a rising cycle of raw material prices. With respect to (b), as average cost basis is used to
determine the cost of the raw materials incorporated, inventories must first be worked through before a decrease in raw material prices
translates into decreased operating costs. In several of ArcelorMittal’s segments, in particular Flat Carbon Americas, Flat Carbon
Europe and Long Carbon Americas and Europe, there are several months between raw material purchases and sales of steel products
incorporating those materials. Although this lag has been reduced recently by changes to the timing of pricing adjustments in iron ore
contracts, it cannot be eliminated and exposes these segments’ margins to changes in steel selling prices in the interim (known as a
“price-cost squeeze”). In addition, as occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008, the first half of 2009 and the third quarter of 2012,
decreases in steel prices may outstrip decreases in raw materials costs in absolute terms.

Given this overall dynamic, the Company’s operating profitability has been particularly sensitive to fluctuations in raw material
prices, which have become more volatile since the iron ore industry moved away from annual benchmark pricing to quarterly pricing
in 2010. In the second half of 2009 and the first half of 2010, steel selling prices followed raw materials prices higher, resulting in
higher operating income as the Company benefitted from higher prices while still working through relatively lower-cost raw materials
inventories acquired in 2009. This was followed by a price-cost squeeze in the second half of 2010, as steel prices retreated but the
Company continued to work through higher-priced raw material stocks acquired during the first half of the year. Iron ore prices were
relatively stable during the first nine months of 2011 but then fell over 30% in three weeks in October 2011 and resulted directly in a
significant fall in steel prices, even though lower raw material prices had yet to feed into operating costs. More recently, iron ore
prices averaged over $140 per tonne CFR China and traded within a $20 range during the first half of 2012 but prices then fell below
$90 by early September. If iron ore and metallurgical coal markets continue to be volatile with steel prices following suit, overhangs


--- Page 3 ---

of previously-acquired raw materials inventories will continue to produce more volatile margins and operating results quarter-to-
quarter. In an environment of wide fluctuations in the prices of steel and raw materials, mini-mills utilizing scrap as a primary input
(which is typically traded on a spot basis) are less exposed to this volatility. With respect to iron ore and coal supply, ArcelorMittal’s
growth strategy in the mining business is an important natural hedge against raw material price volatility. Volatility on steel margins
aside, the results of the Company’s mining segment are also directly impacted by iron ore prices, of which the absolute level was
weaker in 2012 compared to 2011, especially in the second half. As the mining segment’s contribution to the Company’s profitability
grows, the Company’s exposure to the impact of iron ore price fluctuations also increases.

Economic Environment

After recording average global real gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth of 2.8% in 2011, global GDP is estimated to have
slowed to 2.3% in 2012. The year began with a recovery from a sluggish fourth quarter in 2011, but was short-lived as weakness and
reduced demand from the Eurozone contributed to the rapid deceleration of emerging-market economies. Further high oil prices tied
to tensions over Iran’s nuclear program and the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. fiscal cliff compounded the situation. High debt
burdens and austerity of advanced economies and their effects on emerging market growth currently remain the primary risks facing
the world economy.

In the United States, the economy continued to expand at a moderate but uneven pace through 2012 with GDP estimated to have
grown 2.3%. The US economy gained momentum in the first half of the year, despite financial disruption from the euro crisis. The
construction market and consumer demand also showed signs of recovery as 2012 began with improved consumer and business
confidence, combined with better job creation. Factors such as pent-up demand and rising credit availability helped the automotive
sector gain momentum throughout the year. However, threat of the “fiscal cliff’, the impact of Hurricane Sandy and the increasing
tensions over Iran’s nuclear program contributed to sharp increases in oil prices, bringing the United States down from its high at the
start of the year. This also affected spending on equipment as firms became more cautious with respect to capital investment plans.

In Japan, the economy is estimated to have grown by 2.0% in 2012. After dampened growth in the latter part of 2011, 2012
started strong with consumer spending and residential construction on the rise, and the impacts of the natural disasters on supply
chains and infrastructure damage having been largely overcome. However, Japan’s economy began to struggle in response to weak
foreign demand at the end of 2012, exacerbated by the Diaoyus/Senkakus tensions with China impacting in particular Japanese
automotive exports. Domestic demand also weakened with a sharp contraction in GDP during the third quarter of 2012, reflected in a
depreciation of the Japanese yen in the last quarter of 2012 and pushing incoming Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to unveil a US$122bn
spending package to revive the economy.

The economy of the European Union countries (EU27) contracted almost every quarter from the third quarter of 2011, with real
GDP contracting by 0.2% in 2012, compared to growth of 1.6% in 2011. A record high Eurozone unemployment rate of 11.8% in
November 2012 indicates the toll on labor markets of continued weak economic activity and low business confidence. The situation
varies from country to country, with the North (particularly Austria, Benelux, Germany and Scandinavia) faring better than the South
(where a tighter fiscal policy and limited consumer spending have hampered domestic demand).

The readiness of the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide unlimited support for sovereign bond markets in September 2012
encouraged investors and eased financial pressures, limiting risk of contagion in the Eurozone. Italian and Spanish sovereign bond
yields consequently fell toward sustainable levels compared with late 2011. However, Western Europe is still in a recession and
fundamental concerns about austerity, a lack of competitiveness and high debt levels remain.

Emerging market economies suffered for the first three quarters of 2012 from weak growth due to sluggish demand from
developed economies. The Brazilian economy is estimated to have grown by just 1.0% with tightening credit markets in the first half
of the year heavily impacting the country’s automotive sales, prompting the government to support purchases through tax breaks.

Chinese GDP grew by 7.7% in 2012, which is the weakest level of growth in the past 13 years. China’s slowdown further
impacted other emerging market countries prompting their central banks to reverse the monetary tightening cycle of 2011 and lower
interest rates in mid-2012. However, despite experiencing persistently weak exports throughout 2012, in the fourth quarter of 2012,
growth improved and the economy showed signs of recovery as infrastructure, retail sales and industrial production growth all picked
up.

In India, inflation remains uncomfortably high, limiting the ability to reduce interest rates any further to promote growth. India
has struggled with widening current and trade account deficits due to the combination of weaker capital inflows, high imports and
slower export growth.

Growth in Kazakhstan and Russia lost momentum compared to 2011, as foreign energy demand reduced and commodity prices
weakened.

Growth in global industrial production is estimated to have moderated to 2.3% in 2012, compared to growth of 3.8% in 2011,
with output in OECD countries growing 0.6% in 2012, compared to growth of 2.4% in 2011. Output in non-OECD countries grew
44% in 2012 against growth of 6.6% in 2011. The combination of stronger demand in the United States and rapid growth in industrial
production in East Asia were positive factors in the first half of 2012, with output in OECD and non-OECD countries up 1.7% and
4.1% respectively compared to the first half of 2011. In the second half of 2012, output decreased by 0.7% year-on-year in OECD
countries (reflecting low Eurozone demand and tight financial constraints) but remained up 4.8% year-on-year in non-OECD
countries.

Global GDP growth slowed in 2012 to 2.3% from 2.8% in 2011 as the global economy was impacted by the slowdown in Chinese
growth and uncertainty and austerity in Europe. This led to a slowdown in many steel consuming sectors, particularly construction,
contributing to weak underlying real steel demand. Reduced real demand for steel has a knock-on effect on lower demand for raw
materials, pushing prices for iron ore and coal down in the third quarter of 2012. This impact is amplified as changes in raw material
prices feed back into demand for steel as both end-user and stockists destock. As a result, 2012 global apparent steel consumption
(ASC) increased only 1.7%, down sharply from growth of 7.4% in 2011. Within this global ASC growth, regional variations were
strong, with apparent steel consumption down a dramatic 9% in Europe, up only 2% in China and over 7% in the United States in
2012 compared to 2011.

Steel Production®

Annualized world crude steel production, which had bottomed in March 2009 at 1.1 billion tonnes annualized, recovered to just
under 1.4 billion tonnes for the year 2010 (+15.7% y-o-y) and rose to just under 1.5 billion tonnes in 2011 (+7.3% y-o-y). In 2012,
there was a further 1.2% year-on-year increase to 1.51 billion tonnes, driven by Chinese growth.

Steel output in China set another record in 2012 reaching 709 million tonnes (+3.5% higher than 2011) as the weak growth in the
first half and a slump in the summer was compensated by a stronger second half, as the governments pro-growth policies led to a pick-
up in end user demand.

Global production (annualized) outside of China in 2012 decreased 0.8% year-on-year to 802 million tonnes compared to
808 million tonnes produced in 2011. This was mainly due to production declining -4.7% year-on-year in the European Union to 170
million tonnes due to the ongoing economic crisis. In addition, production decreased in South America by -3.0% year-on-year to 47
million tonnes, in Africa by -3.0% year-on-year to 14.8 million tonnes and by -1.2% year-on-year in CIS to 111 million tonnes.
Japanese output was relatively stable down only -0.1% year-on-year to 107 million tonnes. In contrast, the NAFTA region saw an
increase of 2.6% year-on-year to 121 million tonnes, India was up 4.3% year-on-year to 77 million tonnes and South Korea grew 1.2%
year-on-year to 69 million tonnes.

In 2012, global crude steel production rose to nearly 14% above 2007 levels driven by China, India, South Korea and Turkey,
which were all at least 30% above their respective 2007 production levels. In sharp contrast, 2012 EU production was down 19%
compared to its 2007 level, while 2012 production numbers in North America, CIS and Japan were each around 10% below their
respective 2007 levels.

The underlying problems associated with the Euro-zone sovereign debt crisis has had a significant impact on steel production in
Europe, as the sector adapts to reduced demand (with 2012 EU27 steel demand estimated at 29% below 2007 levels). Despite the
region moving from net imports to net exports over the same time period, EU27 steel production is now only 170 million tonnes per
year, whereas in 2006, 207 million tonnes were produced, and, in the first half of 2008, production rose to a peak of more than 220
million tonnes annualized. Capacity in Europe at around 240 million tonnes means that steel plants in Europe are running at an
average utilisation of 70% of capacity, with up to 50 million tonnes of excess capacity, some of which is being closed.

Global steel capacity utilization declined in 2012, due to reduced demand in Europe but also as newly installed capacity surpassed
demand growth in other regions.

In China, steel demand continues to grow but as economic growth slows and the positive impact of the large 2009 infrastructure
led stimulus wanes, demand growth has been too slow, leading to a mismatch of supply and demand in 2012. Chinese production rose
from approximately 650mt annualized during the first half of 2010 to 700mt in the second half of 2012, whereas capacity rose by over
130mt from the end of 2009 to the end of 2012.

3Global production data is from the 62 countries for which monthly production data is collected by the World Steel Association.

Steel Prices*

Steel prices increased during the first quarter of 2012 reaching peak levels of €555 per tonne for spot hot rolled coil (“HRC”) in
Europe in March, and about $800 per tonne in the United States in February, from €495 and $750, respectively, at year-end 2011. This
sharp increase in prices was mainly driven by customer restocking. In the case of Europe, it was also supported by a weak euro which
reduced import attractiveness, while in United States, the steel price increase also reflected strong demand from the automotive,
energy and machinery sectors. Construction remained relatively weak in many regions in the first quarter of 2012.

During the second quarter of 2012, market sentiment weakened due to renewed destocking efforts by customers combined with
oversupply and poor demand. In the United States, the automotive industry held firm, but overall economic activity slowed down,
providing less room for optimism going forward. In Europe, automotive and manufacturing declined as austerity coupled with fears of
a Euro-zone breakup took their toll on confidence and output. By the end of the second quarter, HRC prices had lost about $100-130
per tonne from their first quarter peak. Exports from Asian suppliers in China, South Korea and Japan competing with CIS producers
for scarce international demand also put pressure on international reference prices. Similarly, the slab market experienced a slump in
demand, and prices fell to $550 CFR? in South East Asia at the end of the second quarter of 2012 from levels close to $610 in March
2012.

In the second half of 2012, HRC prices then lost up to $150 per tonne in the United States and about €100 per tonne in
Europe from their first-half peak, with HRC prices reaching lows of €460 in Europe and $650 in the United States at the start of the
fourth quarter of 2012. This sharp fall was due to generally weak buyer sentiment and uncertain financial markets, with destocking
continuing through the third quarter. International export prices remained very weak throughout the second half, with a dramatic fall
of over $80 in South East Asia’s spot HRC price in third quarter, followed by another drop of $5-10 in the fourth quarter, leaving spot
HRC prices at around $560 CFR in the region, at the year end. Similarly, slab prices also eroded during the second half reaching lows
of $460-500 CFR in South East Asia in the fourth of 2012. This dynamic resulted in weak steel selling prices globally for much of the
second half of 2012. Only in the last weeks of 2012 was an upward correction visible, on the back of the upward trend in raw material
prices, which had been initiated in China driven by strong restocking, with HRC transaction prices moving up for first quarter 2013
delivery. The latest spot HRC market prices for late first quarter of 2013 delivery are at €490-510 per tonne in Europe, at $660-695
per tonne in United States and at $560-575 per tonne in China

Pricing for construction-related long products has been mainly driven by the volatile behavior of scrap prices. After a small
improvement in January 2012, with rebar prices in Europe reaching a peak of €580 per tonne, prices went down throughout the first
half to €510-535 per tonne in the second quarter for European domestic Rebar, due to weak construction demand. For medium
sections, prices peaked at €590 per tonne in February 2012 and settled in the range of €635-660 per tonne at the end of first quarter of
2012, followed by a correction downwards to €575-610 per tonne by the end of the second quarter of 2012. Turkish rebar export
prices remained relatively firm and stable during the first quarter, ranging from $650-685 per tonne FOB*, but subsequently declined,
reaching lows of $615-630 per tonne FOB at the end of the second quarter of 2012, due to scrap prices falling by around $60 per tonne
between March and June and ending the second quarter at $385 per tonne CFR Turkey. After the summer holiday period, rebar pricing
in Europe improved by about €10 reaching prices between €512-552 per tonne at the end of the third quarter, while medium sections
remained relatively stable at <580-605 per tonne. Prices in Europe ended 2012 at €575-610 per tonne for medium sections and €502-
532 per tonne for rebar, while Turkish rebar export prices ended the year at $588-599 FOB Turkish port per tonne.

Prices for industrial long products, like quality wire rods and bars went slightly up in the first quarter of 2012 after the seasonal
year-end slowdown in 2011, and remained relatively stable throughout the entire first half of 2012, with quality wire rod prices
ranging between €580-600 in Europe. However, in the second half of 2012, due to weakening demand, a negative price trend also
impacted quality wire rod products, with prices reaching lows of €550 in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Current and Anticipated Trends in Steel Production and Prices’

ArcelorMittal expects global steel production growth to be stronger in 2013 than in 2012, as ArcelorMittal expects global steel
demand to grow around 3% in 2013. In Europe, however, ASC is expected to decline around 1% year on year, despite an end to
destocking as both auto production and construction output continue to decline. In the United States, an improving labor market, rising
availability of credit and low interest rates; coupled by pent-up demand is helping both auto and housing output to grow, supporting
expected ASC growth of 3 to 4 % in 2013. In China, government pro-growth policies, rising loan growth and a renewed focus on
infrastructure spending is driving an expected rebound in ASC growth to 3-4% during 2013. In addition, although global steel
consumption as a whole is already back above pre-crisis levels, developed world consumption is not expected to recover to its 2007

Insight and Oxford Economics) and an estimate for the change in inventories of steel, both at end-users and stockists.

peak for at least another 5 years, with demand in EU27 not expected to be back to peak levels until after 2020 and structural
overcapacity a continuing issue in the region.

Steel selling prices are also rising in early 2013 in line with improved demand in most regions, due to higher raw material prices
and an end to the destocking that was observed during the fourth quarter of 2012. Raw materials prices have a significant impact on
steel prices and in particular iron ore prices have risen to a higher level during January 2013, up significantly on fourth quarter prices,
albeit only slightly higher than the prices seen in the first quarter of 2012. In addition to raw materials prices, the sustainability of
higher steel prices will continue to depend on an increase in sustainable real demand, and no further exacerbation of the Euro-zone
debt crisis. Underlying real demand appears to still be on a rising trend in the United States while the Euro-zone appears to be stuck in
a mild recession. In both markets inventory levels were cut during the fourth quarter of 2012, which should support demand to a
limited extent during the first half of 2013.

Raw Materials

The primary inputs for a steelmaker are iron ore, solid fuels, metallics (e.g., scrap), alloys, electricity, natural gas and base metals.
ArcelorMittal is exposed to price volatility in each of these raw materials with respect to its purchases in the spot market and under its
long-term supply contracts. In the longer term, demand for raw materials is expected to continue to correlate closely with the steel
market, with prices fluctuating according to supply and demand dynamics. Since most of the minerals used in the steel-making
process are finite resources, they may also rise in response to any perceived scarcity of remaining accessible supplies, combined with
the evolution of the pipeline of new exploration projects to replace depleted resources.

As with other commodities, the spot market prices for most raw materials used in the production of steel saw their recent lows
during the global financial crisis of 2008/2009, but have since recovered with a greater degree of volatility. The main driver for the
rise in input prices has been robust demand from China, the world’s largest steel producing country. For example, in 2010/2011, iron
ore reached high levels well above $100 per tonne (e.g. $193 on February 15-16, 2011) due to a lag in additional seaborne supply
compared to increased demand for iron ore on the seaborne market, with high cost domestic iron ore in China filling the demand gap.

Until the 2008-2009 market downturn, ArcelorMittal had largely been able to reflect raw material price increases in its steel
selling prices. However, from 2009 onwards, ArcelorMittal has not been able to fully pass raw materials cost increases on customers
as its steel markets are structurally oversupplied and fragmented. This has resulted in a partial decoupling of raw material costs
(mainly driven by Asian market demand) from steel selling prices achieved in the European market, and consequently increased risk
of margin squeeze.

Until the 2010 changes in raw materials pricing systems described below under “—TIron Ore”, benchmark prices for iron ore and
coal in long-term supply contracts were set annually, and some of these contracts contained volume commitments. In the first half of
2010, the traditional annual benchmark pricing mechanism was abandoned, with the big three iron ore suppliers (Vale, Rio Tinto and
BHP Billiton) adopting a quarterly index-based pricing model. The new model operates on the basis of the average spot price for iron
ore supplied to China, quoted in a regularly published iron ore index. The new system has since generally been adopted by other
suppliers although some iron ore suppliers continue to offer an annual price for their long-term contracts. The price trend as well as
pricing mechanism for coking coal has followed a similar trend, with the annual benchmark pricing system being replaced by a
quarterly pricing system as from the second quarter of 2010 and with a monthly pricing system introduced by BHP Billiton for coal
from Australia in 2011. Following this transition to shorter-term pricing mechanisms that are either based on or influenced by spot
prices for iron ore and coking coal imports to China, price dynamics generally have experienced shorter cycles and greater volatility.
Pricing cycles were further shortened in 2012 as high volatility of prices continued. In 2012, quarterly and monthly pricing systems
were the main type of contract pricing mechanisms, but spot purchases also appeared to have gained a greater share of pricing
mechanisms as steelmakers developed strategies to benefit from increasing spot market liquidity and volatility.

Iron Ore

Chinese demand in the seaborne iron ore market supported high spot iron ore prices during the first three quarters of 2011, within
the range of $160 to $190 per tonne CFR China, before dropping and stabilizing at $140 per tonne CFR China in the fourth quarter of
2011. At $167.59 per tonne CFR China, the average price for 2011 was 14.2% higher than in 2010 ($146.71 per tonne CFR China).
However, the spot iron ore price closed 2011 at $138.5 per tonne, i.e., $30 per tonne lower than at the end of December 2010.

In the first quarter of 2012, spot iron ore prices were stable at $143 per tonne, whereas in the second quarter of 2012, there was
higher volatility with prices reaching $150 per tonne in April, declining to $132 per tonne in mid-May and then hovering around $135
to $138 per tonne in June.

This price drop and volatility in the second quarter of 2012 reflected the slowing Chinese economy and economic difficulties in
Europe, which drove further decline of end user demand for steel and iron ore. Some temporary support of moderately high prices in
the first half of 2012 was provided by the export ban put in place by the Indian government, which limited seaborne supply of Indian
iron ore. However, at the beginning of the third quarter of 2012, the weakness in real demand for seaborne iron ore prevailed. Low

buying activity, due to combined effects of weak economic sentiment, low seasonal demand and pressure on steelmaking margins,
resulted in record sharp drop in the spot price, which, on September 7, 2012, dropped to a 3-year low of $88.5 per tonne.

In the second half of 2012, spot prices per tonne ranged from $135.25 in beginning of July to $106.5 in end of September and
$144.5 at the end of December, with particularly high volatility in December, due to restocking activities in China. This volatility
reflects economic uncertainties in Europe as well as in China.

Coking Coal and Coke

As mentioned above, pricing for coking coal has been affected by changes to the seaborne pricing system, with the annual
benchmark pricing system being replaced by a quarterly pricing system as from the second quarter of 2010 and with a monthly pricing
system introduced by BHP Billiton for coal from Australia in 2011.

2011 was strongly influenced by the impact of the dramatic rain event in Queensland, Australia in the first quarter of 2011,
resulting in most major coking coal mines declaring force majeure as a result of significant structural damage to mines and rai
infrastructure. The situation progressively improved with the last mines lifting force majeure by the end of June 2011. In addition,
several events in the United States, such as tornados in Alabama, reduced the availability of Low Volatile Hard Coking Coal, further
worsening the global shortage in this coal market segment.

In 2011, the scarcity of premium coals was reflected in the high quarterly benchmark price settlements for Australian Har
Coking Coal, rising from $225 per tonne FOB Australia in the first quarter of 2011 to $330 per tonne FOB Australia in the secon
quarter. Thereafter, a successive improvement in supply resulted in price settlements of $315 per tonne FOB Australia in the thir
quarter and $285 per tonne FOB Australia in the fourth quarter. As supply was progressively restored in Australia following the rain
event and demand decreased due to ongoing economic uncertainty, prices began to decrease further, with the benchmark price
settlement for the first quarter of 2012 at $235 per tonne. The downward trend continued in the second quarter of 2012, with the
benchmark price settled at $210 per tonne. The degree of price decline in premium coals in the second quarter of 2012 was lessene
by strikes at BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance (“BMA”) mines.

The rain season in the first half of 2012 was mild, with no significant supply disruptions (other than the strikes at BMA mines).
Moreover, Australian miners had upgraded mine infrastructure to be better prepared to deal with adverse weather conditions during
the wet season in Queensland. The second half of 2012 experienced sharp spot price and contract benchmark price reductions, with a
relatively high gap between both references (spot indexes and quarterly contract settlements), with quarterly contract benchmark
reference settled at $220 per tonne (FOB Australia) and $170 per tonne for the third and fourth quarters of 2012, respectively, while
spot values for such quarters averaged $173.9 and $154.9 per tonne, respectively. In parallel, the spot market, as reflected by the
various index providers, also decreased over 2012 in line with progressively improved supply, with a noticeable price gap between
premium coal and non premium coals. The main reason for the sharp declines in the coking coal spot price was a healthy availability
of coking coal supply from traditional exporting regions (Australia, United States and Canada) as well as from new regions, notably
Mongolia and Mozambique, combined with declining import demand of Asian steelmakers as well as lower demand on the Atlantic
basin due to the economic difficulties in Europe. In the fourth quarter of 2012, major seaborne suppliers of coking coal from Australia
and the United States announced the closure of the least cost efficient mines in order to adjust market supply to weaker seaborne
demand and to remain cost competitive in a challenging pricing environment.

The spot price for hard coking coal, FOB Australia, gradually recovered towards end of 2012, from around $160 per tonne at the
end of September 2012 to $140-145 per tonne at the beginning of October 2012 and then back to $160 per tonne by the end of
December 2012.

Throughout 2012, China continued, as it had in 2011, to increase coking coal imports from Mongolia. It also increased imports
from US and Canadian sources and remained an active player on the seaborne market.

ArcelorMittal leveraged its full supply chain and diversified supply portfolio in terms of suppliers and origin of sources to
overcome the significant supply disruptions during 2011 without any significant impact on its operations. In 2012, ArcelorMittal
further diversified its supply portfolio by adding new supply sources from emerging mines in Mozambique as well as Russia.

Scrap

Scrap availability for 2012 was tighter than in previous years, given the demand supply balance and the resulting pricing. In 2012,
scrap prices were relatively high, and the Eurofer Index for demolition scrap average for 2012 was €307, i.e., 1% higher than in 2008
and 29% higher than in 2007. In 2010 and 2011, the index average was €273 and €321, respectively.

During the first half of 2012, scrap prices increased by €20 per tonne in January, and the market was relatively stable through
May, with the first major price decrease occurring in June of approximately €20 per tonne, reflecting variations in supply and demand.
Pricing remained rather weak in the third quarter of 2012. Pricing in the fourth quarter of 2012 was volatile, with October being the
weakest month with a price of €273 per tonne, and thereafter picking up by approximately €26 per tonne in December due to the

1


--- Page 8 ---

seasonal holidays, and in anticipation of weather related restrictions and the trend over the past three years of a jump in opening
January prices. The Eurofer Index for demolition scrap was at an average of €322 per tonne in the first half of 2012 and €292 per
tonne in the second half of 2012 and was at approximately 310 — €315 in January 2013. In North America, prices followed a similar
trend, remaining reasonably stable from January to May 2012 at an average of $400/It (Platts SBB HMS 1 and 2): prices thereafter
however dropped a sharp $50/It in June and were weak throughout the third quarter of 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2012, October
was the weakest month, with a price of $317.5/lt and increased by $35/It in December 2012. In the first half and second half of 2012,
the average price was $391/long ton (It) and $341/It, respectively. At the end of January 2013, the price in North America was at
approximately $350 — 355/It.

According to the Turkey Statistical Institute, from January to December 2012, Turkey imported 22.42 million tonnes of scrap,
representing a 6% increase year-on-year.

According to the China Association of Metal Scrap Utilization, China’s scrap imports decreased 26% year-on-year from 6.77
million tonnes in 2011 to 4.97 million tonnes in 2012. Also China’s scrap ratio decreased from 135.5 kg per metric ton of steel in
January 2012 to 112.2 kg in October 2012.

Ferro Alloys and Base Metals
Ferro Alloys®

The underlying price driver for manganese alloys is the price of manganese ore, which increased by 9.35% from the level of
$4.49/dry metric tonne unit (““dmtu’) (for 43% lump ore) on Cost, Insurance and Freight (“CIF”) China in January 2012 to $4.91/dmtu
in December 2012, mainly due to increased demand from China.

On the back of the manganese ore trend, average prices of main Manganese alloy also increased in 2012, with an increase of
4.32% in the price per tonne for High Carbon Ferro Manganese (from $1,076 to $1,122), 3.71% for Silico Manganese (from $1,133 to
$1,175), whereas average Medium Carbon Ferro Manganese prices decreased by 4.90% (from $1,573 to $1,496) and Ferro Silicon
prices have also decreased by 3.69% (from $1,491 to $1,436).

Base Metals - Zinc?

Base metals used by ArcelorMittal are zinc and tin for coating, and aluminum for deoxidization of liquid steel. ArcelorMittal
partially hedges its exposure to its base metal inputs in accordance with its risk management policies.

ArcelorMittal purchased 427 kt of zinc metals in 2012. The average London Metal Exchange (“LME”) cash price of zinc metal
was $1,946 per ton for 2012, representing a decrease of 11% as compared to the average price for 2011 ($2,191). Stocks registered at
the LME warehouses stood at 1,220 kt at the end of 2012, up 49% from 820 kt at the end of 2011, mainly due to oversupply of zinc
metals in the world.

Energy
Electricity

In most of the countries where ArcelorMittal operates, electricity prices have moved in line with other commodities. In North
America, prices in 2012 decreased as compared to 2011 (to less than $45/MWh), in line with the low natural gas prices. In Europe, the
market was mostly impacted by poor demand. The European Energy Exchange’s (“EEX”) year-ahead price for Germany averaged
49.5 /MWh in 2012, down 13% compared to 2011. The need for investment in replacement and additional power generating capacity
by providers and in improved electricity grid stability due to volatility from renewable suppliers remains clear, but still not apparent in
light of current economic conditions.

Natural Gas

Natural gas is priced regionally. European prices are historically linked with petroleum prices but a significant spot market is
developing. North American natural gas prices trade independently of oil prices and are set by spot and future contracts, traded on the
NYMEX exchange or over-the-counter. Elsewhere, prices are set on an oil derivative or bilateral basis, depending on local market
conditions. International oil prices are dominated by global supply and demand conditions and are also influenced by geopolitical
factors, such as the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to limit production.

The 2011 trends continued in 2012. The Liquefied Natural Gas (“LNG”) market surplus continued to be absorbed by increased
demand in Asia, especially in Japan for electricity production following the Fukushima disaster and in China to meet growing natural
gas requirements. Given the limited new capacity coming into the market in 2012 — 2014, LNG spot supply conditions remain

difficult, especially for supplies to Asia where spot prices have reached in constrained periods the oil-heat equivalent of $18 to
$19/MMBritish thermal unit (“Btu”).

In the United States, abundant unconventional gas production has been replacing steam coal to produce power, leading to a
significant increase in demand, and projects to build liquefaction facilities for export to Asia are continuing to develop. In that context,
prices in North American markets averaged $2.84/MMBtu with prices dropping below $2/MMBtu for a short period.

In Europe, gas demand remains very low and the gap between long-term oil-indexed contracts and spot gas prices increased, with
prices in long term oil-indexed contracts being about $14/MMBtu while spot prices remained around $9/MMBtu. Current ongoing
renegotiation between European gas companies and major utilities suppliers are only expected to close part of the gap between oil
indexed and European spot.

Ocean Freight”

Market rates remained extremely low in 2012 generally due to the global slowdown and the extensive fleet size. The Baltic Dry
Index (“BDI”) reached its lowest point in 25 years and averaged at around 920 points for 2012 as compared to an average of 1,549 for
full year 2011.

Global trade was slow in 2012 but picked up in the second quarter with iron ore shipments out of Brazil seeing a rise, although
underlying concern for the global economy remained. The summer remained weak but the second half of the year generally saw trade
increases due to Chinese restocking. A total of 1.15bilion tons of iron ore and 229 million tons of coal were shipped; a growth of 6%
and 2% y-o-y. Meanwhile, the growing delivery list of ships on order and the current order book weighed heavily on time charter rates
by easily absorbing all new cargoes in the market.

The Capesize rates remained low for most of the year; although a small uptick was seen around September-October 2012.
Overall, rates remained under pressure due to the size of the fleet. The Capesize rates averaged $7,680/day for 2012 as compared to an
average of $15,639/day for 2011.

Export bans for Indonesia (for coal) and India (for iron ore) resulted in lower rates for Panamax, as did reduced US grain exports
and a slowdown in Chinese coastal trade. Rates remained under pressure as the rate of delivery of new ships remained strong. The
Panamax rates averaged $7,684/day in 2012 as compared to an average of $13,999/day in 2011.

Impact of Exchange Rate Movements

After reaching a yearly low in the first quarter of 2012 against most currencies in the jurisdictions where ArcelorMittal operates,
the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly during the second and the third quarter to finish during the fourth quarter at a yearly high
against the Brazilian real, the South African rand, the Ukrainian hryvnia, the Kazak tenge and the Argentinean peso, but came back at
the end of fourth quarter to previous levels seen in the first quarter against the euro, the Polish zloty, the Czech koruna and the
Mexican peso (among other currencies).

Because a substantial portion of ArcelorMittal’s assets, liabilities, sales and earnings are denominated in currencies other than the
US. dollar (its reporting currency), ArcelorMittal has exposure to fluctuations in the values of these currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar. These currency fluctuations, especially the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, as well as fluctuations in the
currencies of the other countries in which ArcelorMittal has significant operations and sales, can have a material impact on its results
of operations. In order to minimize its currency exposure, ArcelorMittal enters into hedging transactions to lock-in a set exchange rate,
as per its risk management policies.

In June 2008, ArcelorMittal entered into a transaction in order to hedge U.S. dollar-denominated raw material purchases until
2012. The hedge involved a combination of forward contracts and options that initially covered between 60% to 75% of the dollar
outflow from the Company’s European subsidiaries based on then-current raw materials prices, amounting to approximately $20
billion. The transaction was unwound during the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting in a deferred gain of approximately $2.6 billion
recorded in equity and of $349 million recorded in operating income. The gain recorded in equity along with the recording of hedged
expenses is being recycled in the consolidated statements of operations during the period from 2009 through the first quarter of 2013;
of this amount, $566 million was recorded as income within cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $600
million for the year ended December 31, 2011. See Note 17 to ArcelorMittal’s 2012 consolidated financial statements.

Trade and Import Competition
Europe! '

While import competition in the European Union steel market reached a high of 37.5 million tonnes of finished goods during
2007, equal to 18.9% of steel demand, as demand has decreased, imports have also declined, reaching a low of 15 million tonnes in
2009, equal to an import penetration ratio of 12.6%. In 2010, imports recovered to 18.4 million tonnes but a similar increase in
domestic deliveries resulted in an import penetration ratio of 12.7%.

In 2011, a rise in finished imports to 23.1 million tonnes resulted in the import penetration ratio increasing to 15.1%. As demand
in Europe has continued to decline, imports again declined in 2012. Imports fell 31.5% year-on-year in the first half of 2012, pushing
down the penetration ratio to 12.1% and again down 21.2% year-on-year (based on December license data) in the second half of 2012,
with the penetration ratio remaining at approximately 12.1% in both the first and second halves of the year. Overall in 2012, finished
imports for 2012 fell by 27.1% over the previous year.

United States'*

After reaching a record level of 32.5 million tonnes in 2006, or an import penetration ratio of 27.1%, total finished imports
bottomed at 12.9 million tonnes in 2009, representing an import penetration ratio of 22.2%. In 2010, imports recovered to 17.1 million
tonnes but a similar rise in demand resulted in a minor drop in import penetration to 21.1%. The import penetration in 2011 remained
relatively stable at 21.7%, although imports edged up to 19.7 million tonnes together with stronger finished steel consumption.

Finished imports during the first half of 2012 increased by 22.6% year-over-year and despite stronger demand, the import
penetration ratio increased to 24.1%. Imports in the second half of the year were weaker than first half levels (although remain up
13.5% year on year), with the import penetration ratio falling to 23.7%. Overall for 2012 finished imports increased 18.1% year-over-
year to 23.4 million tonnes with penetration at 23.9%.

Consolidation in the Steel and Mining Industries

The global steel and mining industries have experienced a consolidation trend over the past ten years. After pausing during the
credit crisis and global economic downturn of 2008-2009, merger and acquisition activity of various steel and mining players,
including Chinese and Indian companies, has increased at a rapid pace. However, given the current economic uncertainties in the
developed economies, combined with a slowdown in emerging regions such as China and India, consolidation transactions decreased
significantly in terms of number and value in 2012 and this trend is expected to continue in 2013 until prices stabilize and supply and
demand balance out in the context of worldwide structural overcapacity.

Apart from Mittal Steel’s acquisition of Arcelor in 2006 and their merger in 2007, notable mergers and acquisitions in the steel
business in recent years include the merger of Tata Steel and Corus (itself the result of a merger between British Steel and
Hoogovens); U.S. Steel’s acquisitions in Slovakia and Serbia; Evraz and Severstal’s acquisitions in North America, Europe and South
America, and expansion in North and South America by Brazilian steel company Gerdau. Most recently, on October 1, 2012,
Japanese steelmakers Nippon Steel Corp. and Sumitomo Metals Industries Ltd. completed their merger and created the world’s
second-largest steel company. On December 28, 2012, Outokumpu and Inoxum, the stainless division of Thyssen-Krupp, completed
their merger in order to create the worldwide leader in stainless steel.

As developed markets continued to present fewer opportunities for consolidation, steel industry consolidation also began to slow
down substantially in China in 2012. Despite being a key initiative of the five-year plan issued in March 2011, the concentration
process of the steel industry that is expected to reduce overcapacity, rationalize steel production based on obsolete technology,
improve energy efficiency, achieve environmental targets and strengthen the bargaining position of Chinese steel companies in price
negotiations for iron ore declined as a result of the slowing economy. This situation could affect the Chinese government’s objective
for the top ten Chinese steel producers to account for 60% of national production by 2015 and for at least two producers to reach
100 million ton capacity in the next few years.

Merger and acquisition activity is expected to remain active in the Indian steel and mining industry though at a lower pace
considering the current economic slowdown. The country has become the world’s third largest steel consumer after China and the
United States and is expected to become soon the world’s second largest steel producer worldwide. The integration of Ispat Industries
into JSW Steel was a major consolidation step in 2010.

Recent and expected future industry consolidation should foster the ability of the steel industry to maintain more consistent
performance through industry cycles by achieving greater efficiencies and economies of scale, and should lead to improved bargaining

power relative to customers and, crucially, suppliers, which tend to have a higher level of consolidation. The wave of steel industry
consolidation in the previous years has followed the lead of raw materials suppliers, which occurred in an environment of rising prices
for iron ore and most other minerals used in the steel-making proc The merger of Cliffs Natural Resources and Consolidated
Thompson in 2011 was a significant consolidation move in North America which, at the same time, strengthened vertical relationships
into the Chinese steel market. Despite the declines in prices in 2011 and 2012, iron ore producers continue to seek consolidation that
would strengthen their options whatever the direction of future price trends. There are still only four primary iron ore suppliers in the
world market. Consolidation among other mining companies is also in progress, as evidenced by the merger between Xstrata and
Glencore International which should be completed in the first quarter of 2013.

Operating Results

ArcelorMittal reports its operations in six reportable segments: Flat Carbon Americas, Flat Carbon Europe, Long Carbon
Americas and Europe, Asia, Africa and CIS, Distribution Solutions and Mining, which was added as a separate reportable segment as
from the first quarter of 2011.

Key Indicators
The key performance indicators that ArcelorMittal’s management uses to analyze operations are sales, average steel selling prices,
steel shipments, iron ore and coal production and operating income. Management’s analysis of liquidity and capital resources is driven
by operating cash flows.

ArcelorMittal had sales of $84.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, representing a decrease of 10% from sales of
$94.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. In the first half of 2012, sales of $45.2 billion represented a 4% decrease from
sales of $47.3 billion in the first half of 2011, primarily due to a drop in average steel prices and marginally lower shipments, resulting
from weaker market conditions compared to 2011, particularly in Europe, and relative appreciation of the U.S. dollar. In the second
half of 2012, sales of $39.0 billion represented a 16% and 14% decrease from sales of $46.7 billion and $45.2 billion in the second
half of 2011 and in the first half of 2012, respectively, primarily driven by lower average steel prices and lower steel shipments, due to
weak market conditions compared to the first half of 2011 and the first half of 2012.

ArcelorMittal had steel shipments of 83.8 million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2012, representing a decrease of 2%
from steel shipments of 85.8 million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2011. Average steel selling price for the year ended
December 31, 2012 decreased 8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 following the decrease in key raw material prices,
demand contraction in Europe and economic slowdown in China. Average steel selling price in the first half of 2012 decreased by 6%
from the same period in 2011, while average steel selling price in the second half of the year was down 11% from the same period in
2011.

ArcelorMittal had own iron ore production of 55.9 million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of 3% as
compared to 54.1 million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2011. ArcelorMittal had own coking coal production of 8.2 million
tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of 1% as compared to 8.3 million tonnes for the year ended December 31,
2011.

Flat Carbon Americas

Sales in the Flat Carbon Americas segment were $20.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, representing a decrease of
4% as compared to $21.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. Sales decreased primarily due to a 4% decrease in average
steel selling prices as shipments were relatively flat. Sales in the first half of 2012 were $10.6 billion, up 1% from the same period in
2011 primarily driven by a 3% increase in shipments partly offset by a 1% decrease in average steel selling prices, and in the second
half of the year sales were $9.5 billion, down 10% from the same period in 2011 primarily driven by a 8% decrease in average steel
selling prices along with a 3% decline in shipments.

Total steel shipments were 22.3 million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2012 and remained flat compared to the year
ended December 31, 2011. Shipments were 11.4 million tonnes in the first half of 2012, up 3% from the same period in 2011, while
shipments in the second half of the year were 10.9 million tonnes, down 3% from the same period in 2011.

Average steel selling price decreased 4% for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2011. Average steel selling price in the first half of 2012 was down 1% from the same period in 2011, while average steel selling price
in the second half of the year was down 8% from the same period in 2011.

Flat Carbon Europe

Sales in the Flat Carbon Europe segment were $27.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, representing a decrease of
12% as compared to $31.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a 12% decrease in
average steel selling price while steel shipments decreased by 4%. Sales in the first half of 2012 were $14.9 billion, down 9% from the
same period in 2011, and in the second half of the year sales were $12.3 billion, down 17% from the same period in 2011.

Total steel shipments were 26.0 million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of 4% from steel shipments for
the year ended December 31, 2011. Shipments were 14.2 million tonnes in the first half of 2012, down 2% from the same period in
2011, while shipments in the second half of the year were 11.8 million tonnes, down 6% from the same period in 2011. The decrease
in the second half of 2012 resulted in particular from market weakening and strong destocking activity in the fourth quarter.

Average steel selling price decreased 12% for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2011. The decline in average steel selling prices was mainly due to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar, the reduction of
raw material prices and demand contraction in Europe. Average steel selling price in the first half of 2012 was down 11% from the
same period in 2011, while average steel selling price in the second half of the year was down 14% from the same period in 2011.

Long Carbon Americas and Europe

In the Long Carbon Americas and Europe segment, sales were $21.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, representing a
decrease of 13% from sales of $25.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was due both to a 6% decrease in
average steel selling price along with a 5% decrease in steel shipments. Sales in the first half of 2012 were $11.5 billion, down 9%
from the same period in 2011, while sales in the second half of the year were $10.4 billion, down 17% from the same period in 2011.

Total steel shipments reached 22.6 million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of 5% from steel shipments
for the year ended December 31, 2011. Shipments were 11.6 million tonnes in the first half of 2012, down 4% from the same period in
2011, while shipments in the second half of the year were 11.1 million tonnes, down 7% from same period in 2011.

Average steel selling price decreased 6% for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2011 primarily due to the weakening of local currency against the U.S. dollar; the increase in local average steel selling prices in
Americas was fully offset by a decrease in Europe. Average steel selling price in the first half of 2012 was down 4% from the same
period in 2011, while average steel selling price in the second half of the year was down 8% from the same period in 2011.

AACIS

In the AACIS segment, sales were $10.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, representing a decrease of 7% from sales
of $10.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a 9% decrease in average selling price.
Sales in the first half of 2012 were $5.5 billion, up 1% from the same period in 2011, while sales in the second half of the year were
$4.6 billion, down 14% from the same period in 2011.

Total steel shipments reached 12.8 million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of 3% from steel shipments
for the year ended December 31, 2011. Shipments were 6.7 million tonnes in the first half of 2012, up 4% from the same period in
2011, while shipments in the second half of the year were 6.2 million tonnes, up 1% from the same period in 2011.

Average steel selling price decreased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2011. This decrease was mainly related to the weakening of the South African rand against U.S. dollar, lower prices in CIS and
African markets following lower raw material prices and economic slowdown in China resulting in lower prices in key markets.
Average steel selling price in the first half of 2012 was down 5% from the same period in 2011, while average steel selling price in the
second half of the year was down 14% from the same period in 2011.

Distribution Solutions

In the Distribution Solutions segment, sales were $16.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, representing a decrease of
14% from sales of $19.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to an 11% decrease in average
steel selling price. Sales in the first half of 2012 were $8.7 billion, down 6% from the same period in 2011, while sales in the second
half of the year were $7.6 billion, down 23% from the same period in 2011.

Total steel shipments reached 17.7 million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of 4% from steel shipments
for the year ended December 31, 2011. Shipments were 9.1 million tonnes in the first half of 2012, up 4% from the same period in
2011, while shipments in the second half of the year were 8.6 million tonnes, down 10% from the same period in 2011.

Average steel selling price decreased 11% for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2011. The decrease in average steel selling prices was mainly related to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar, the decline
in raw material prices and demand contraction in Europe. Average steel selling price in the first half of 2012 was down 9% from the
same period in 2011, while average steel selling price in the second half of the year was down 13% from the same period in 2011.

Mining

In the Mining segment, sales were $5.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, representing a decrease of 14% from sales
of $6.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices of iron ore and coal

14


--- Page 15 ---

driven by a decrease in international prices, which was partially offset by higher shipments from own mines for both iron ore and coal.
Lower selling prices on marketable coal and iron ore sales (internal market-priced plus external sales) accounted for approximately
$1.1 billion of the decrease in the mining segment sales. Sales in the first half of 2012 were $2.8 billion, up 2% from the same period
in 2011, while sales in the second half of the year were $2.5 billion, down 27% from the same period in 2011 (iron ore prices were
down 26% during the same reference period). Sales to external customers were $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012,
representing a 12% increase compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is mainly due to higher
shipment volumes of iron ore sold externally. Iron ore shipments to external customers increased 15% from 9 million tonnes in 2011
to 10.4 million tonnes in 2012, and coal shipments to external customers decreased by 5% from 3.5 million tonnes to 3.3 million
tonnes. The increase in the volume of external sales of iron ore was due in part to the Company’s increasing marketing efforts in
anticipation of increasing mining production. The Company expects the trend toward an increase in the external sales as a percentage
of overall mining sales to continue in the near to mid-term. With respect to prices, for example, the average benchmark iron ore price
per tonne in 2012 of $130.0 CFR China (62% Fe) and the average benchmark price for hard coking coal (Low Volatile peak-down)
FOB Australia in 2012 of $191.0 per tonne were 22% and 35% lower than in 2011, respectively. It should be noted, however, that
there may not be a direct correlation between benchmark prices and actual selling prices in various regions at a given time.

increase in cost of production, resulted in lower intragroup-margin eliminations.
ArcelorMittal’s operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $3.2 billion, as compared with an operating income of

$4.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The operating loss in 2012 reflected the $4.3 billion impairment of goodwill in the
European businesses and $1.3 billion charges related to asset optimization (of which $0.7 billion of fixed asset impairment charges

15


--- Page 16 ---

and $0.6 billion of restructuring charges) as well as price-cost squeeze during the year, primarily in steel, but also in mining, following
reduction of raw material prices, demand contraction in Europe and economic slowdown in China.

Operating income in the first half of 2012 was lower than in the first half of 2011 and then decreased to a slight operating loss in
the third quarter and then to a significant operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2012, when the above-mentioned impairment loss was
recognized. Cost of sales consists primarily of purch of raw materials necessary for steel-making (iron ore, coke and coking coal,
scrap and alloys), electricity, repair & maintenance costs, as well as direct labor costs, depreciation and impairment. Cost of sales for
the year ended December 31, 2012 was $84.1 billion as compared to $85.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. Excluding
impairment losses of $5 billion described below, cost of sales decreased by 7% as a result of lower shipments and lower raw material
prices. Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $3.3 billion as compared
to $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. SG&A remained relatively stable compared to sales as it represented 3.9% of
sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 included impairment losses of $5,035 million, which compared to
impairment losses of $331 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. These impairment losses included a charge of $4,308
million with respect to goodwill in the European operating segments ($2,493 million, $1,010 million and $805 million for Flat Carbon
Europe, Long Carbon Europe and Distribution Solutions, respectively), as a result of the downward revision of cash flow projections
due to the weak macro economic and market environment in Europe and the expectation that this situation will persist over the near
medium term. Impairment losses also included a charge of $222 million relating to facilities in Spain and North Africa in the Long
Carbon Europe operating segment; in determining these expenses, the Company analyzed the recoverable amount of these facilities
based on their value in use and determined that the recoverable amount from these facilities was less than their carrying amount. In
connection with long term idled assets, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $505 million including $130 million related to
the liquid phase at the Florange site of ArcelorMittal Atlantique et Lorraine in France (Flat Carbon Europe) and $61 million recorded
in connection with the extended idling of the electric arc furnace and continuous caster at the Schifflange site of ArcelorMittal
Rodange & Schifflange in Luxembourg (Long Carbon Europe). ArcelorMittal also recognized an impairment loss amounting to $296
million in respect of the intended permanent closure of the coke plant and six finishing lines at the Liége site of ArcelorMittal Belgium
(Flat Carbon Europe). See “—Critical Accounting Policies and Uses of Judgments and Estimates—Impairment of Tangible and
Intangible Assets, including Goodwill”.

Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 was reduced by a net gain of $220 million recorded on the sale of carbon
dioxide credits (the proceeds of which will be re-invested in energy saving projects), a non-cash gain of $566 million relating to
unwinding of hedges on raw material purchases (see “—Overview—Impact of Exchange Rate Movements”), gains on disposal of
Skyline Steel and the stake in Paul Wurth for $331 million and 242 million, respectively, and a curtailment gain of $241 million due to
changes to the employee benefit plans at ArcelorMittal Dofasco.

Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 was negatively impacted by restructuring costs associated with asset
optimization, totaling $587 million, primarily affecting various Distribution Solutions entities, Flat Carbon Europe and Long Carbon
Europe operations. Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 was also negatively impacted by a charge of $182 million
including one-time signing bonus and actuarial losses related to post retirement benefits following the conclusion of the new US labor
agreement.

Flat Carbon Americas

Operating income for the Flat Carbon Americas segment amounted to $0.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012,
compared to operating income of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease in operating income in 2012
generally reflected price-cost squeeze effects following lower average steel selling prices in North American operations. Operating
income was also negatively impacted by the weaker market conditions in the international slab market and the South American
markets which affected the results of the Mexican and Brazilian operations. Operating loss for the segment amounted to $0.1 billion
for the second half of the year, compared to operating income of $0.6 billion in the first half. The operating loss in the second half of
2012 reflected the effect of a price-cost squeeze, especially in North America in the fourth quarter, in which the operating loss was
substantially driven by a 6% decrease in average selling price as compared to the third quarter of 2012. Operating income for the first
half of the year was positively impacted by the curtailment gain of $241 million resulting from the changes to the pension plan and
health and dental benefits in ArcelorMittal Dofasco in Canada. Operating loss for the second half of the year included a charge of
$182 million including one-time signing bonus and actuarial losses related to post retirement benefits following the conclusion of the
new US labor agreement.

Flat Carbon Europe

Operating loss for the Flat Carbon Europe segment for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $3.7 billion compared to operating
loss of $0.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. Operating loss for the segment amounted to $3.3 billion for the second half
of the year, compared to operating loss of $0.4 billion in the first half of the year. Operating loss for the year ended December 31,
2012 occurred in a context of deterioration of the economic environment in Europe resulting in lower shipment volumes (-4%), lower

16


--- Page 17 ---

average steel selling prices (-12%) and price-cost squeeze effects. The Flat Carbon Europe segment is particularly exposed to price-
cost squeeze effects resulting from the overhang of high-cost raw material inventories and the negative impact of the time lag of
passing along increases in cost to customers, as it does not have a significant amount of captive iron ore supply, and demand.
contraction in Europe, where apparent steel consumption declined by 9% in 2012 compared to 2011.

Flat Carbon Europe’s operating loss (particularly in the second half of the year) mainly resulted from a $2,493 million impairment
charge of goodwill and $448 million impairment losses related to property, plant and equipment in the framework of asset
optimization, of which $130 million in respect of the long term idling of the liquid phase at the Florange site of ArcelorMittal
Atlantique et Lorraine in France and $296 million with respect to the intention to permanently close the coke plant and six finishing
lines at the Liége site of ArcelorMittal Belgium. In addition, operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 was increased by
restructuring costs amounting to $355 million as part of asset optimization, of which $231 million related to the closure of the primary
facilities at the Liége site of ArcelorMittal Belgium and $64 million associated with separation schemes primarily relating to
ArcelorMittal Poland. These charges were partially offset by a gain of $210 million recorded on the sale of carbon dioxide credits (the
proceeds of which will be re-invested in energy saving projects) and a non-cash gain of $566 million relating to unwinding of hedges
on raw material purchases.

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 had been negatively impacted by impairment losses of $141 million
relating to various idled facilities (including $85 million for the primary facilities of ArcelorMittal Li¢ge Upstream, Belgium). These
charges were offset by a gain of $93 million recorded on the sale of carbon dioxide credits (the proceeds of which will be re-invested
in energy saving projects) and a non-cash gain of $600 million relating to unwinding of hedges on raw material purch: . In addition,
operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 had been negatively impacted by restructuring costs associated with asset
optimization, totaling $143 million, primarily relating to Spanish entities.

Long Carbon Americas and Europe

Operating loss for the Long Carbon Americas and Europe segment for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $0.6 billion
compared to operating income of $0.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease in operating income in 2012
generally reflected the deterioration of the economic environment in Europe, resulting in lower shipment volumes (which were down
5%) and lower average steel selling prices (down 6%). Operating loss for the segment amounted to $1.0 billion for the second half of
the year, compared to operating income of $0.4 billion in the first half of the year, primarily driven by an impairment charge of $1,010
million related to goodwill, lower steel shipment volumes and lower average selling price. European operations were particularly
exposed to price-cost squeeze effects resulting from the overhang of high-cost raw material inventories and the negative impact of the
time lag of passing along increases in cost to customers, as it does not have a significant amount of captive iron ore supply and to
demand contraction in Europe.

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012 (in particular in the second half of 2012) was negatively impacted by an
impairment charge of goodwill for $1,010 million and a net impairment charge of property, plant and equipment for $270 million,
including $222 million related to Spanish and North African entities and $61 million related to the extended idling of the electric arc
furnace and continuous caster at the Schifflange site in Luxembourg.

In addition, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012 was negatively impacted by restructuring costs totaling $98
million associated with asset optimization, primarily in Spanish entities.

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 was negatively impacted by impairment losses of $178 million of which
$151 million related to the extended idling of the ArcelorMittal Madrid electric arc furnace. In addition, operating income for the year
ended December 31, 2011 was negatively impacted by restructuring costs associated with asset optimization, totaling $37 million.

AACIS

Operating loss for the AACIS segment for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $0.1 billion, compared to operating income of
$0.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. Lower profitability in 2012 was primarily due to lower average steel selling prices,
which declined 9% compared to 2011. Operating loss for the segment amounted to $52 million for the second half of the year,
compared to $36 million in the first half. Operating income in the second half included the gain on disposal of Paul Wurth for $242
million. Excluding this gain, profitability decreased significantly during the second half of 2012 and in particular in the fourth quarter
due to negative price-cost squeeze and lower volumes sold.

Distribution Solutions
Operating loss for the Distribution Solutions segment for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $0.7 billion, compared to
operating income of $0.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 was

mainly related to a $805 million goodwill impairment charge. The decrease in operating income in 2012 generally reflected the effect
of lower average steel selling prices and negative price-cost impacts in the context of deteriorated economic conditions in Europe.

17


--- Page 18 ---

Operating loss for the segment amounted to $1.0 billion for the second half of the year, compared to operating income of $0.3 billion
in the first half of 2012, primarily as a result of the impairment charge recorded in the second half of 2012. Operating loss for the year
ended December 31, 2012 also included restructuring charges of $127 million relating to asset optimization and the $331 million gain
on disposal of Skyline Steel.

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 had been negatively impacted by restructuring costs associated with
asset optimization, totaling $40 million across various entities.

Mining

Operating income for the Mining segment for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $1.2 billion, compared to operating income
of $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The 54% decrease in operating income in 2012 generally reflected lower iron
ore and coal selling prices and higher input costs. In terms of selling prices, as noted above, the average reference price of iron ore
decreased from $167.59/tonne CFR China for 62% Fe in 2011 to $130/tonne in 2012. Iron ore marketable volume for the year ended
December 31, 2012 was 28.8 million tonnes, compared to 28.0 million tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2011. Coal marketable
volume for the year ended December 31, 2012 was stable at 5.1 million tonnes, compared to 4.9 million tonnes for the year ended
December 31, 2011. Cost of sales increased from $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, an increase of 8% primarily due to higher shipments and
higher input cost.

Operating income for the segment amounted to $0.4 billion for the second half of the year, compared to $0.8 billion in the first
half. The decrease in the second half of 2012 was primarily driven by lower iron ore and coal selling prices as well as lower shipments
of marketable volumes (internal transfers reported at market price and external sales) from own mines for iron ore.

Income from Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures

ArcelorMittal recorded income of $0.2 billion from investments in associates and joint ventures for the year ended December 31,
2012, as compared with income from investments in associates and joint ventures of $0.6 billion for the year ended December 31,
2011. Income for the year ended December 31, 2012 was lower compared to 2011 due to losses from Chinese investees and impacts of
disposals. It included a net gain of $101 million on the disposal of a 6.25% stake in Erdemir and an impairment loss of $185 million,
reflecting the reduction of the carrying amount of the investment in Enovos to the net proceeds from the sale. Income for the year
ended December 31, 2011 included an impairment loss of $107 million, reflecting the reduction of the carrying amount of the
investment in Macarthur Coal to the net proceeds from the sale, as a result of the Company’s withdrawal from the joint venture with
Peabody Energy to acquire ownership of Macarthur Coal.

Financing Costs-Net

Net financing costs include net interest expense, revaluation of financial instruments, net foreign exchange income/expense (i.e.,
the net effects of transactions in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a subsidiary) and other net financing costs
(which mainly include bank fees, accretion of defined benefit obligations and other long term liabilities). Net financing costs were
relatively stable for the year ended December 31, 2012, at $2.7 billion, as compared with $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31,
2011.

Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to
$1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. Interest expense was slightly higher for the year ended December 31, 2012 at $2.0
billion, compared to interest expense of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to increased costs following
the rating downgrades in August, November and December resulting in step-ups in the interest rate payable on most of the Company’s
outstanding bonds. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2012 amounted to $0.2 billion, compared to $0.1 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2011.

Foreign exchange and other net financing costs (which include bank fees, interest on pensions, impairment of financial
instruments and fair value adjustments of derivative instruments) remained stable; they amounted to $0.9 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2012 as compared to c of $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. While these costs were relatively
stable from year to year, there were significant variations from quarter to quarter, resulting from the impact of fluctuation in the @$
exchange rate on the Company’s euro denominated debt (translation effect).

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)

ArcelorMittal recorded an income tax benefit of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to an income tax
expense of $0.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The full year 2012 income tax benefit of $1.9 billion was primarily
driven by deferred tax benefits recognized on write-downs of the value of shares of consolidated subsidiaries in Luxembourg, partially
offset by reversal of deferred taxes in Europe and South America. For additional information related to ArcelorMittal’s income taxes,
see Note 20 to ArcelorMittal’s consolidated financial statements.

ArcelorMittal’s consolidated income tax expense (benefit) is affected by the income tax laws and regulations in effect in the
various countries in which it operates and on the pre-tax results of its subsidiaries in each of these countries, which can vary from year
to year. ArcelorMittal operates in jurisdictions, mainly in Eastern Europe and Asia, that have a structurally lower corporate income tax
rate than the statutory tax rate as in effect in Luxembourg (28.8% until December 31, 2012 — 29.22% as from 2013), and enjoys,
mainly in Western Europe, structural (permanent) tax advantages such as notional interest deduction and tax credits. The income
reported through the Company’s finance centers located principally in Belgium and Dubai is not taxable.

The statutory income tax expense (benefit) and the statutory income tax rates of the countries that most significantly resulted in
the tax expense (benefit) at statutory rate for each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012 are as set forth below:

Non-Controlling Interests

Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests was $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared with net
loss attributable to non-controlling interests of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase relates to lower income
in subsidiaries with non-controlling interests, particularly in Africa.

Discontinued Operations

Net income from discontinued operations (i.e., the Company’s stainless steel business, which was spun-off into a separate
company, Aperam, whose shares were distributed to ArcelorMittal shareholders in the first quarter of 2011) for the year ended
December 31, 2012 was nil compared to $461 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, including $42 million of the post-tax net
results contributed by the stainless steel business prior to the completion of the spin-off on January 25, 2011. The balance of $419
million represents a one-time income from the recognition through the consolidated statements of operations of gains/losses relating to
the demerged assets previously recognized in equity.

Net Income Attributable to Equity Holders of the Parent

ArcelorMittal’s net loss attributable to equity holders of the parent for the year ended December 31, 2012 amounted to $3.7
billion compared to net income attributable to equity holders of $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, for the reasons
discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
ArcelorMittal’s principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from its operations and its credit facilities at the corporate level.

Because ArcelorMittal is a holding company, it is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of, and dividends and distributions
from, its operating subsidiaries to pay expenses and meet its debt service obligations. Significant cash or cash equivalent balances may
be held from time to time at the Company’s international operating subsidiaries, including in particular those in France, where the
Company maintains a cash management system under which most of its cash and cash equivalents are centralized, and in Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, Morocco, South Africa, Ukraine and Venezuela. Some of these operating subsidiaries have debt
outstanding or are subject to acquisition agreements that impose restrictions on such operating subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends,
but such restrictions are not significant in the context of ArcelorMittal’s overall liquidity. Repatriation of funds from operating
subsidiaries may also be affected by tax and foreign exchange policies in place from time to time in the various countries where the
Company operates, though none of these policies is currently significant in the context of ArcelorMittal’s overall liquidity.

In management’s opinion, ArcelorMittal’s credit facilities are adequate for its present requirements.

As of December 31, 2012, ArcelorMittal’s cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash and short-term investments,
amounted to $4.5 billion as compared to $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2011. In addition, ArcelorMittal had available borrowing
capacity of $10.0 billion under its credit facilities as of December 31, 2012 as compared to $8.6 billion as of December 31, 2011.
ArcelorMittal also has a €1 billion (approximately $1.3 billion) commercial paper program (of which €.1 billion or approximately
$0.1 billion was outstanding as of December 31, 2012), and its policy has been to maintain availability under its credit facilities as
back-up for its commercial paper program.

As of December 31, 2012, ArcelorMittal’s total debt, which includes long-term debt and short-term debt, was $26.3 billion,
compared to $26.4 billion as of December 31, 2011. Net debt (defined as long-term debt plus short-term debt, less cash and cash
equivalents and restricted cash) was $21.8 billion as of December 31, 2012, down from $22.5 billion at December 31, 2011. Most of
the external debt is borrowed by the parent company on an unsecured basis and bears interest at varying levels based on a combination
of fixed and variable interest rates. Gearing (defined as net debt divided by total equity) at December 31, 2012 was 39% as compared
to 37% at December 31, 2011. Total equity will be reduced in 2013, as a result of new accounting rules with respect to deferred
employee benefits taking effect as of January 1, 2013 (IAS 19 amendments), which will result in an increase of deferred employee
benefit liabilities against a charge to equity in the amount of the funding deficit of $5.0 billion (before income tax credits). Total debt
remained stable period-on-period. Net debt decreased period-on-period primarily due to improvement in cash from operations,
issuance of capital securities and cash proceeds from divestments.

The margin under ArcelorMittal’s principal credit facilities and certain of its outstanding bonds is subject to adjustment in the
event of a change in its long-term credit ratings. Due, among other things, to the weak steel industry outlook and ArcelorMittal’s
credit metrics and level of debt, Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch downgraded the Company’s rating to below “investment
grade” in August, November and December 2012, respectively, and Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s currently have ArcelorMittal’s
credit rating on negative outlook. These downgrades triggered the interest rate “step-up” clauses in most of the Company’s
outstanding bonds, resulting in an increased interest expense of $38 million in 2012. Regaining an investment grade rating is a
strategic target for the Company.

ArcelorMittal’s principal credit facilities, which are the $6 billion revolving credit facility entered into on March 18, 2011 (the
“$6 Billion Facility”), the $4 billion revolving credit facility entered into on May 6, 2010 (the “$4 Billion Facility”) and the $500
million multi-currency revolving letter of credit facility entered into on September 30, 2010, which was reduced to $450 million on
October 26, 2012, contain restrictive covenants. Among other things, these covenants limit encumbrances on the assets of
ArcelorMittal and its subsidiaries, the ability of ArcelorMittal’s subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of ArcelorMittal and its
subsidiaries to dispose of assets in certain circumstances. These agreements also require compliance with a financial covenant, as
summarized below.

The Company must ensure that the ratio of “Consolidated Total Net Borrowings” (consolidated total borrowings less consolidated
cash and cash equivalents) to “Consolidated EBITDA” (the consolidated net pre-taxation profits of the ArcelorMittal group for a
Measurement Period, subject to certain adjustments as set out in the facilities) does not, at the end of each “Measurement Period”
(each period of 12 months ending on the last day of a financial half-year or a financial year of the Company), exceed a certain ratio,
currently 3.5 to one. The Company refers to this ratio as the “Leverage Ratio”. As of December 31, 2012, the Company was in
compliance with the Leverage Ratio.

Non-compliance with the covenants in the facilities described above would entitle the lenders under such facilities to accelerate
the Company’s repayment obligations. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants in the agreements related to all
of its borrowings as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

As of December 31, 2012, ArcelorMittal had guaranteed approximately $0.9 billion of debt of its operating subsidiaries and $1.1
billion of total debt of ArcelorMittal Finance. ArcelorMittal’s debt facilities have provisions whereby the acceleration of the debt of
another borrower within the ArcelorMittal group could, under certain circumstances, lead to acceleration under such facilities.

The following table summarizes the repayment schedule of ArcelorMittal’s outstanding indebtedness, which includes short-term
and long-term debt, as of December 31, 2012.

owned Luxembourg subsidiary of the Company to a Luxembourg affiliate of Crédit Agricole (formely Calyon S.A) in December 2009. In
April 2011, the conversion date of the mandatory convertible bond was extended to January 31,2013. On September 27, 2011, the
Company increased the amount of the mandatory convertible bond by $250 million to a total amount of $1 billion. In December 2012, the
conversion date of the mandatory convertible bond was extended to January 31, 2014. In December 2010, ArcelorMittal acquired certain
call options on its own shares in order to hedge its obligations arising out of the potential conversion of its Euro Convertibles and its USD
Convertibles.

On May 6, 2010, ArcelorMittal entered into the $4 Billion Facility, a three-year revolving credit facility for general corporate
purposes. On September 30, 2011, the maturity date of the $4 Billion Facility was extended to May 6, 2015. As of December 31,
2012, the $4 Billion Facility remains fully available.

On June 30, 2010, ArcelorMittal entered into a bilateral three-year revolving credit facility of $300 million. On July 12, 2010,
ArcelorMittal entered into an additional bilateral three-year revolving credit facility of $300 million, which was retroactively effective
as of June 30, 2010. Each of these facilities was to be used for general corporate purposes and was originally scheduled to mature in
2013. The two facilities were cancelled (one as of December 31, 2011, and one as of December 31, 2012).

On September 30, 2010, ArcelorMittal entered into the $500 million revolving multi-currency letter of credit facility (the “Letter
of Credit Facility”). The Letter of Credit Facility is used by the Company and its subsidiaries for the issuance of letters of credit and
other instruments. The terms of the letters of credit and other instruments contain certain restrictions as to duration. On September 30,
2011, the maturity of the Letter of Credit Facility was extended from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016. The Letter of Credit
Facility was amended on October 26, 2012 so that letters of credit and other instruments are issued on a bilateral basis instead of
through a fronting mechanism and to reduce its amount to $450 million.

2012 Capital Markets Transactions

On February 28, 2012, ArcelorMittal completed an issuance of three series of U.S. dollar denominated Notes, consisting of $500
million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Notes (4.25% as of August 25, 2012 following a credit downgrade) due 2015, $1,400
million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Notes (5.00% as of August 25, 2012) due 2017 and $1,100 million aggregate principal
amount of 6.25% Notes (6.75% as of August 25, 2012) due 2022.

On March 2, 2012, ArcelorMittal completed a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of its 5.375% U.S. dollar denominated
notes due 2013. ArcelorMittal accepted to purchase $298 million principal amount of such notes for a total aggregate purchase price
(including other financial charges and accrued interests) of $314 million. Upon settlement for all of the notes accepted pursuant to the
offer, the remaining outstanding principal amount of notes as of December 31, 2012 was $1.2 billion.

On September 28, 2012, the Company issued subordinated perpetual capital securities for a nominal amount of $650 million with
a coupon of 8.75%, which will reset periodically over the life of the securities, with the first reset after five years and subsequently
every five years thereafter. A step up in interest of 0.25% will occur on the second reset date and a subsequent step up of 0.75%
(cumulative with the initial 0.25%) fifteen years later. The Company is entitled to call the securities in five years, ten years and on
subsequent coupon payment dates. As the Company has no obligation to redeem the securities and the coupon payment is
discretionary, it classified the net proceeds from the issuance of the subordinated perpetual capital securities ($642 million net of
transaction costs) as equity.

On December 18, 2012, the conversion date of the $1 billion mandatory convertible bond was extended from January 31, 2013 to
January 31,2014.

Mandatory convertible bonds

On December 28, 2009, the Company issued through a wholly-owned subsidiary unsecured and unsubordinated $750 million
mandatory convertible bonds into preferred shares of such subsidiary. The bonds were placed privately with a Luxembourg affiliate of
Crédit Agricole (formerly Calyon S.A.) and were not listed. The Company originally had the option to call the mandatory convertible
bonds from May 3, 2010, which date was later amended to April 20, 2011, until ten business days before the maturity date. This call
option is recognized at fair value and the Company recognized in 2012 a loss of $99 million ($42 million gain in 2011) for the change
in fair value in the consolidated statements of operations. The subsidiary invested the proceeds of the bonds issuance and an equity
contribution by the Company in notes issued by subsidiaries of the Company linked to shares of Erdemir and Macarthur, both of
which were publicly-listed companies in which such subsidiaries hold a minority stake. The subsidiary may also, in agreement with
Crédit Agricole, invest in other financial instruments. These bonds bear a floating interest rate based on three months Libor plus a
margin payable on each February 25, May 25, August 25 and November 25. The Company determined the bonds met the definition of
a compound financial instrument in accordance with IFRS. As such, the Company determined the fair value of the financial liability
component of the bonds was $55 million on the date of issuance.

On April 20, 2011, the conversion date of the mandatory convertible bonds was extended to January 31, 2013. The Company
determined that this transaction led to the extinguishment of the existing compound instrument and the recognition of a new
compound instrument including a financial liability of $60 million.


--- Page 24 ---

On September 27, 2011, the Company increased the mandatory convertible bonds from $750 million to $1 billion. The Company
determined that this increase led to the extinguishment of the existing compound instrument and the recognition of a new compoun
instrument.

On December 18, 2012, the conversion date of the $1 billion mandatory convertible bond was extended from January 31, 2013 to
January 31, 2014. The Company determined that this transaction led to the extinguishment of the existing compound instrument an
the recognition of a new compound instrument including a financial liability of $48 million.

As of December 31, 2012, $48 million is included in long-term debt and carried at amortized cost. As of December 31, 2011, $52
million was included in long-term debt. The value of the equity component of $951 million ($934 million net of tax and fees at
December 31, 2011 ) was determined based upon the difference of the total nominal amount of mandatory convertible bonds of $
billion and the fair value of the financial liability component on December 18, 2012 and is included in equity as non-controlling
interests.

As a result of the completion of the sale of the Macarthur shares on December 21, 2011, the notes issued by a subsidiary of
ArcelorMittal and linked to the Macarthur shares were subject to an early redemption for $1,208 million. Prior to December 31, 2011
the Company committed to Crédit Agricole to replace those notes with new notes issued by a different subsidiary of ArcelorMittal
linked to shares of China Oriental Group Company Ltd (“China Oriental”). The proceeds from the redemption of the notes were
invested in a term deposit with Crédit Agricole until January 17, 2012. On that date, notes linked to China Oriental were issued by a
subsidiary of ArcelorMittal.

Commercial Paper Program

ArcelorMittal has a €1.0 billion commercial paper program in the French market, which had approximately €0.1 billion ($0.1
billion) outstanding as of December 31, 2012 as compared to &.5 billion ($0.6 billion) as of December 31, 2011.

True Sale of Receivables (“TSR”) Programs

The Company has established a number of programs for sales without recourse of trade accounts receivable to various financial
institutions (referred to as True Sale of Receivables (“TSR”)) for an aggregate amount of $5,250 million as of December 31, 2012.
This amount represents the maximum amounts of unpaid receivables that may be sold and outstanding at any given time. Of this
amount, the Company has utilized $4,275 million and $4,424 million, as of December 31, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Through the
TSR programs, certain operating subsidiaries of ArcelorMittal surrender the control, risks and benefits associated with the accounts
receivable sold; therefore, the amount of receivables sold is recorded as a sale of financial assets and the balances are removed from
the consolidated statements of financial position at the moment of sale. The total amount of receivables sold under TSR programs and
derecognized in accordance with IAS 39 for the years ended 2011 and 2012 was $35.3 billion and $33.9 billion, respectively (with
amounts of receivables sold converted to U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rate). Expenses incurred under the TSR
programs (reflecting the discount granted to the acquirers of the accounts receivable) recognized in the consolidated statements of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012 were $152 million and $182 million, respectively.

Earnings Distribution

Considering the worsening global economic conditions since September 2008, ArcelorMittal’s Board of Directors recommended
on February 10, 2009, a reduction of the annual dividend in 2009 to $0.75 per share (with quarterly dividend payments of $0.1875)
from $1.50 per share previously. The dividend policy was approved by the annual general meeting of shareholders on May 12, 2009,
and was also maintained in 2010, 2011 and 2012. In 2012, quarterly dividend payments took place on March 13, 2012, June 14,
2012, September 10, 2012 and December 10, 2012.

In consideration of the challenging global economic conditions impacting the Company’s business and its priority to deleverage,
The Board of Directors will submit to the approval of the shareholders at the annual general meeting of shareholders to be held in May
2013 a proposal to reduce the annual dividend payment to $0.20 per share in 2013, as compared to $0.75 per share in 2012. The
dividend payment calendar is available on www.arcelormittal.com.

ArcelorMittal held 11.8 million shares in treasury as of December 31, 2012, as compared to 12.0 million shares as of
December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2012, the number of treasury shares was equivalent to approximately 0.76% of the total
issued number of ArcelorMittal shares.

Sources and Uses of Cash

The following table presents a summary of cash flow of ArcelorMittal:

--- Page 25 ---

Summary of Cash Flow

(in $ millions) Year ended December 31,
2011 2012
Net cash provided by operating activities 1,777 5,294
Net cash used in investing activities (3,678) (3,660)
Net cash used in financing activities (540) (1,044)

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash provided by operating activities increased to $5.3 billion, as compared with $1.8
billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, mainly because of operating working capital release. The net cash provided by
operating activities was positively impacted by a $2.8 billion decrease in working capital (consisting of inventories plus trade accounts
receivable less trade accounts payable), driven by a $2.8 billion decrease in inventories ( accounts receivable decreased by $1.2
billion and accounts payable decreased by $1.1 billion, cancelling each other out). As the average number of rotation days of
inventories remained stable, inventories decreased mainly as a result of lower levels of steel production compared to 2011 and lower
raw material prices as the average benchmark ore price per tonne of $130.0 CFR China and the average benchmark price for hard
coking coal FOB Australia were 22% and 35% lower than in 2011, respectively, leading to a lower carrying value of raw materials
and finished steel products in inventory. Accounts receivable decreased mainly as a result of lower sales. Accounts payable decreased
as a result of lower purchases of raw materials and lower raw material prices. The year-on-year increase in net cash provided by
operating activities was due in particular to strong operating cash flow generation in the second quarter for $2.2 billion and in the
fourth quarter of $2.9 billion, themselves driven by a release of working capital for $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively
(resulting in turn largely from lower inventories and trade receivables).

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was stable at $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Net inflows
related to disposals amounted to $1.0 billion, including $674 million from the sale of Skyline Steel, $264 million from the sale of the
Company’s stake in Erdemir, $189 million (after adjustment for dividends) corresponding to the first installment from the sale of the
Company’s stake in Enovos and a net outflow (the excess of cash on the balance sheet of Paul Wurth over the cash consideration
received) of $89 million relating to the disposal of Paul Wurth.

In 2012, capital expenditure totalled $4.7 billion, $3.2 billion of which was related to maintenance in steelmaking facilities
(including health and safety investments) and $1.5 billion dedicated to growth projects in mining. In 2011, capital expenditure was
$4.8 billion, $3.5 billion of which was related to steelmaking facilities (including health and safety investments) and $1.3 billion
dedicated to mining projects. In 2013, capital expenditure is expected to amount to approximately $3.5 billion, $2.7 billion of which is
expected to be maintenance-related (including health and safety investments) and $0.8 billion of which is expected to be dedicated to
growth projects in mining. The Company is focusing only on core growth capital expenditure in its mining business given potentially
attractive return profiles of projects under construction. Some planned steel investments remain suspended. The Phase 2 expansion of
the Liberian mining operation involves the construction of a concentrator, among other things, and will be capital-intensive over the
2013-2015 period.

ArcelorMittal’s major capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2012 included the following major projects: Andrade
capacity expansion plan in Andrade mine in Brazil, Liberia greenfield mining project; capacity expansion plan and replacement of
spirals for enrichment in ArcelorMittal Mines in Canada. The following tables summarize the Company’s principal growth and
optimization projects involving significant capital expenditures completed in 2012 and those that are currently ongoing.

capacity of 15 million tonnes per annum. The first concentrate production is expected in 2015, replacing the Phase | — 4 million tonnes per
annum direct-shipped operation.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to $0.5 billion in 2011.
The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in debt repayments, partly offset by proceeds from
issuance of subordinated perpetual capital securities for $642 million and from long-term debt, primarily due to bond issuances. The
Company issued €500 million 4.500% (5.75% after downgrade) Notes due 2018 under its & billion wholesale Euro Medium Term
Notes Programme as well as three series of U.S. dollar denominated notes, consisting of $500 million 3.750% (4.25% after
downgrade) Notes due 2015, $1.4 billion 4.500% (5.00% after downgrade) Notes due 2017 and $1.1 billion 6.250% (6.75% after
downgrade) Notes due 2022. The proceeds from these issuances were used to refinance existing indebtedness including a repayment
of the Company’s syndicated credit facility. Furthermore, as part of a cash tender offer, the Company accepted for purchase $299
million principal amount of its 5.375% Notes due 2013 for a total aggregate purchase price (including other financial charges and
accrued interests) of $314 million; the remaining outstanding principal amount of such Notes is $1.2 billion. Net cash used in
financing activities also included outflow for purchases of non-controlling interests.

Dividends paid during the year ended December 31, 2012 were $1.2 billion, including $1,171 million paid to ArcelorMittal
shareholders and $20 million paid to non-controlling shareholders in subsidiaries. Dividends paid in the year ended December 31,
2011 were $1.2 billion.

Equity

Equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent decreased to $51.7 billion at December 31, 2012, as compared to $56.7
billion at December 31, 2011, primarily due to the net loss attributable to the equity holders of the parent of $3.7 billion and dividend
payments of $1.2 billion. See Note 18 to ArcelorMittal’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Research and Development, Patents and Licenses

Costs relating to research and development, patents and licenses were not significant as a percentage of sales. Research and
development costs expensed (and included in selling, general and administration expenses) in 2011 and 2012 amounted to $306
million and $285 million, respectively.

Trend Information and Outlook

All of the statements in this “Trend Information” section are subject to and qualified by the information set forth under the
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”. See also “Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations”.

Operating income plus depreciation and impairment is expected to be higher in 2013 as compared to 2012. Steel shipments are
expected to increase by approximately 2-3% in 2013 as compared to 2012. With the completion of the management gains program and
asset optimization, per-tonne steel margins are expected to improve marginally in 2013 as compared to 2012. With the ArcelorMittal
Mines Canada expansion to 24mtpa on track for ramp up during the first half of 2013, market-priced iron ore shipments are expected
to increase by approximately 20% in 2013 relative to 2012. The Company expects to spend approximately $3.5 billion on capital
expenditures, of which $2.7 billion is maintenance-related. Approximately $5 billion of cash receipts expected from the $4 billion
combined share and mandatorily convertible notes offering in January 2013 and the announced agreed sale of a 15% stake in
ArcelorMittal Mines Canada (assuming completion of such sale on schedule), should enable net debt to decline to approximately $17
billion by June 30, 2013. The Company has a medium term objective to reduce its net debt to $15 billion.

Disclosures about market risks

ArcelorMittal is exposed to a number of different market risks arising from its normal business activities. Market risk is the
possibility that changes in raw materials prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, base metal prices (zinc, nickel,
aluminum and tin) and energy prices (oil, natural gas and power) will adversely affect the value of ArcelorMittal’s financial assets,
liabilities or expected future cash flows.

The fair value information presented below is based on the information available to management as of the date of the consolidated
statements of financial position. Although ArcelorMittal is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair
value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of this annual report since that date, and therefore,
the current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented below. The estimated fair values of certain
financial instruments have been determined using available market information or other valuation methodologies that require
considerable judgment in interpreting market data and developing estimates. The fair value estimates presented below are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts that ArcelorMittal could realize in current market transactions.

Risk Management

ArcelorMittal has implemented strict policies and procedures to manage and monitor financial market risks. Organizationally,
supervisory functions are separated from operational functions, with proper segregation of duties. Financial market activities are
overseen by the CFO, the Corporate Finance and Tax Committee and the Group Management Board.

All financial market risks are managed in accordance with the Treasury and Financial Risk Management Policy. These risks are
managed centrally through Group Treasury by a group specializing in foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity, internal and
external funding and cash and liquidity management.

All financial market hedges are governed by ArcelorMittal’s Treasury and Financial Risk Management Policy, which includes a
delegated authority and approval framework, sets the boundaries for all hedge activities and dictates the required approvals for all
Treasury activities. Trading activity and limits are monitored on an ongoing ba: ArcelorMittal enters into transactions with
numerous counterparties, mainly banks and financial institutions, as well as brokers, major energy producers and consumers.

As part of its financing and cash management activities, ArcelorMittal uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to
changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodities prices. These instruments are principally interest rate and currency
swaps, spots and forwards. ArcelorMittal may also use futures and options contracts.

Counterparty Risk

ArcelorMittal has established detailed counterparty limits to mitigate the risk of default by its counterparties. The limits restrict
the exposure ArcelorMittal may have to any single counterparty. Counterparty limits are calculated taking into account a range of
factors that govern the approval of all counterparties. The factors include an assessment of the counterparty’s financial soundness and
its ratings by the major rating agencies, which must be of a high quality. Counterparty limits are monitored on a periodic basis.

All counterparties and their respective limits require the prior approval of the Corporate Finance and Tax Committee. Standard
agreements, such as those published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) are negotiated with all
ArcelorMittal trading counterparties.

Derivative Instruments

ArcelorMittal uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and
commodity prices. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations or in
equity according to nature and effectiveness of the hedge. For more information, see Note 17 of ArcelorMittal’s consolidated financial
statements.

Derivatives used are conventional exchange-traded instruments such as futures and options, as well as non-exchange-traded
derivatives such as over-the-counter swaps, options and forward contracts.

Currency Exposure
ArcelorMittal seeks to manage each of its entities’ exposure to its operating currency. For currency exposure generated by

activities, the conversion and hedging of revenues and costs in foreign currencies is typically performed using currency transactions
on the spot market and forward market. For some of its business segments, ArcelorMittal hedges future cash flows.

27


--- Page 28 ---

Because a substantial portion of ArcelorMittal’s assets, liabilities, sales and earnings are denominated in currencies other than the
US. dollar (its reporting currency), ArcelorMittal has exposure to fluctuations in the values of these currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar. These currency fluctuations, especially the fluctuation of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, the Canadian dollar,
Brazilian real and South African rand, as well as fluctuations in the currencies of the other countries in which ArcelorMittal has
significant operations and/or sales, could have a material impact on its results of operations.

ArcelorMittal faces transaction risk, where its businesses generate sales in one currency but incur costs relating to that revenue in
a different currency. For example, ArcelorMittal’s non-U.S. subsidiaries may purchase raw materials, including iron ore and coking
coal, in U.S. dollars, but may sell finished steel products in other currencies. Consequently, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar will
increase the cost of raw materials, thereby negatively impacting the Company’s operating margins.

Based on estimates for 2012, the table below reflects the impact of a 10% depreciation of the functional currency on budgeted
cash flows expressed in the respective functional currencies of the various entities:

ArcelorMittal faces translation risk, which arises when ArcelorMittal translates the financial statements of its subsidiaries,
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollars for inclusion in ArcelorMittal’s consolidated financial statements.

Based on estimates for 2012, the table below, in which it is assumed that there is no indexation between sales prices and exchange
rates, illustrates the impact of a depreciation of 10% of the U.S. dollar.

Interest Rate Sensitivity
Short-Term Interest Rate Exposure and Cash
Cash balances, which are primarily composed of euros and U.S. dollars, are managed according to the short term (up to one year)

guidelines established by senior management on the basis of a daily interest rate benchmark, primarily through short-term interest rate
swaps and short-term currency swaps, without modifying the currency exposure.

28


--- Page 29 ---

Interest Rate Risk on Debt

ArcelorMittal’s policy consists of incurring debt at fixed and floating interest rates, primarily in U.S. dollars and euros according
to general corporate needs. Interest rate and currency swaps are utilized to manage the currency and or interest rate exposure of the
debt.

The estimated fair values of ArcelorMittal’s short- and long-term debt are as follows:

2011 2012
Carrying Estimated Carrying Estimated
Value Fair Value Value Fair Value

(Amounts in $ millions)
Instruments payable bearing interest at variable rates 4,156 3,743 1,485 1,629

Short term bank loans and other credit facilities including commercial paper 1,531 1,561 723 884

Commodity Price Sensitivity

ArcelorMittal utilizes a number of exchange-traded commodities in the steel-making process. In certain instances, ArcelorMittal
is the leading consumer worldwide of certain commodities. In some businesses and in certain situations, ArcelorMittal is able to pass
this exposure on to its customers through surcharges. The residual exposures are managed as appropriate.

Financial instruments related to commodities (base metals, energy and freight) are utilized to manage ArcelorMittal’s exposure to
price fluctuations.

Hedges in the form of swaps and options are utilized to manage the exposure to commodity price fluctuations.

In respect of non-exchange traded commodities, ArcelorMittal is exposed to possible increases in the prices of raw materials such
as iron ore (which is generally correlated with steel prices with a time lag) and coking coal. This exposure is managed through long-
term contracts. For a more detailed discussion of ArcelorMittal’s iron ore and coking coal purchases.

Key Transactions and Events in 2012

ArcelorMittal’s principal investments, acquisitions and disposals, and other key events that occurred during the year ended
December 31, 2012 are summarized below.

On December 31, 2012, ArcelorMittal entered into an agreement pursuant to which its wholly owned subsidiary,
ArcelorMittal Mines Canada Inc. (“AMMC”), and a consortium led by POSCO and China Steel Corporation (“CSC”) will
create joint venture partnerships to hold ArcelorMittal’s Labrador Trough iron ore mining and infrastructure assets. The
consortium, which also includes certain financial investors, will acquire a 15% interest in the joint ventures for total
consideration of $1.1 billion in cash, with AMMC and its affiliates retaining an 85% interest. As part of the transaction,
POSCO and CSC will enter into long-term iron ore off-take agreements proportionate to their joint venture interests. The

on establishing itself as a premier supplier of high-strength steels and value-added products for China’s fast growing
automotive market. In line with a new shareholding agreement they have entered into, the Valin Group and ArcelorMittal
intend to increase VAMA's planned capacity by 25% from 1.2 million tonnes to 1.5 million tonnes, with capital investment to
increase by 15% to CNY 5.2 billion (approximately $834 million). VAMA has signed purchase agreements totaling CNY 1.8
billion (approximately $289 million) for key equipment including cold rolling facilities, continuous annealing and
galvanizing lines. The joint venture is expected to become operational in the first half of 2014. ArcelorMittal and the Valin
Group also announced the possible recalibration by ArcelorMittal of its shareholding in Hunan Valin. The two companies
have finalized a share swap arrangement based upon a Put Option mechanism, which enables ArcelorMittal to exercise, over
the next two years, Put Options granted by the Valin Group with respect to Hunan Valin shares. Under this arrangement,
ArcelorMittal (which currently holds approximately 30% of the shares of Hunan Valin) could sell up to 19.9% of the total
equity (600 million shares) in Hunan Valin to the Valin Group. The exercise period of the Put Options is equally spaced with
a gap of six months and linked to the key development milestones of VAMA. Following the exercise of the Put Options,
ArcelorMittal would retain a 10.07% shareholding in Hunan Valin as part of a long-term strategic cooperation agreement.
ArcelorMittal's acquisition of the additional 16% shareholding in VAMA, which would be financed by the sale of shares in
Hunan Valin using the Put Options, was approved by the Chinese authorities in December 2012. The put option exercise
dates are February 6, 2013, August 6, 2013, February 6, 2014 and August 6, 2014. The exercise price per share is CNY 4 for
the first two dates and CNY 4.4 for the last two dates. The Company exercised the first put option on February 6, 2013 and
its stake in Hunan Valin decreased accordingly to 25%.

Board Practices/Corporate Governance
This section describes the corporate governance practices of ArcelorMittal.
Board of Directors and Group Management Board

ArcelorMittal is governed by a Board of Directors and managed by a Group Management Board. The Group Management Board
is assisted by a Management Committee.

A number of corporate governance provisions in the Articles of Association of ArcelorMittal reflect provisions of the
Memorandum of Understanding signed on June 25, 2006 (prior to Mittal Steel’s merger with Arcelor), amended in April 2008 and
which mostly expired on August 1, 2009. For more information about the Memorandum of Understanding see Related Parties
Transactions on page 70.

ArcelorMittal fully complies with the 10 Principles of Corporate Governance of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange except with
regard to Recommendation 1.3 about the separation of the roles of chairman of the board of directors and the head of executive
management, as explained in more detail in “Other Corporate Governance practices” below. ArcelorMittal also complies with the
New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual as applicable to foreign private issuers.

Board of Directors
Composition

The Board of Directors is in charge of the overall governance and direction of ArcelorMittal. It is responsible for the performance
of all acts of administration necessary or useful in furtherance of the corporate purpose of ArcelorMittal, except for matters reserved
by Luxembourg law or the Articles of Association to the general meeting of shareholders. The Articles of Association provide that the
Board of Directors is composed of a minimum of three and a maximum of 18 members, all of whom, except the Chief Executive
Officer, must be non-executive directors. None of the members of the Board of Directors, except for the Chief Executive Officer, may
hold an executive position or executive mandate within ArcelorMittal or any entity controlled by ArcelorMittal.

The Articles of Association provide that Directors are elected and removed by the general meeting of shareholders by a simple
majority of votes cast. Other than as set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, no shareholder has any specific right to
nominate, elect or remove Directors. Directors are elected by the general meeting of shareholders for three-year terms. In the event
that a vacancy arises on the Board of Directors for any reason, the remaining members of the Board of Directors may by a simple
majority elect a new Director to temporarily fulfill the duties attaching to the vacant post until the next general meeting of the
shareholders.

Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors on May 13, 2008. Mr. Mittal is also ArcelorMittal’s Chief
Executive Officer. Mr. Mittal was re-elected to the Board of Directors for a three-year term by the annual general meeting of
shareholders on May 10, 2011.

The Board of Directors is comprised of 11 members, of which 10 are non-executive Directors and one is an executive Director.
The Chief Executive Officer of ArcelorMittal is the sole executive Director.

Eight of the 11 members of the Board of Directors are independent. The non-independent Directors are the executive Director,
Ms. Vanisha Mittal Bhatia and Mr. Jeannot Krecké. A Director is considered “independent” if:

(a) he or she is independent within the meaning of the Listed Company Manual of the New York Stock Exchange, as applicable
to foreign private issuers,

(b) he or she is unaffiliated with any shareholder owning or controlling more than two percent of the total issued share capital of
ArcelorMittal, and

42


--- Page 43 ---

(c) the Board of Directors makes an affirmative determination to this effect.

For these purposes, a person is deemed affiliated to a shareholder if he or she is an executive officer, a director who also is an
employee, a general partner, a managing member or a controlling shareholder of such shareholder. The 10 Principles of Governance of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, which constitute ArcelorMittal's domestic corporate governance code, require ArcelorMittal to
define the independence criteria that apply to its Directors.

Specific characteristics of the Director role

The Company’s Articles of Association do not require directors to be shareholders of the Company. The Board of Directors
nevertheless adopted a share ownership policy on October 30, 2012, considering that it is in the best interests of all shareholders for all
non-executive directors to acquire and hold a minimum number of ArcelorMittal ordinary shares in order to better align their long-
term interests with those of ArcelorMittal’s shareholders. The Board of Directors believes that this share ownership policy will result
in a meaningful holding of ArcelorMittal shares by each non-executive Director, while at the same time taking into account the fact
that the share ownership requirement should not be excessive in order not to unnecessarily limit the pool of available candidates for
appointment to the Board. Directly or indirectly, and as sole or joint beneficiary owner (e.g., with a spouse or minor children), within
five years of the earlier of October 30, 2012 or the relevant person’s election to the Board of Directors, the Lead Independent Director
should own a minimum of 15,000 ordinary shares and each other non-executive director should own a minimum of 10,000 ordinary
shares. Each director will hold the shares acquired on the basis of this policy for so long as he or she serves on the Board of Directors.
Directors purchasing shares in compliance with this policy must comply with the ArcelorMittal Insider Dealing Regulations and, in
particular, and refrain from trading during any restricted period, including any such period that may apply immediately after the
Director’s departure from the Board of Directors for any reason.

On October 30, 2012, the Board of Directors also adopted a policy that places limitations on the terms of independent Directors as
well as the number of directorships Directors may hold in order to align the Company’s corporate governance practices with best
practices in this area. The policy provides that an independent Director may not serve on the Board of Directors for more than 12
consecutive years, although the Board of Directors may, by way of exception to this rule, make an affirmative determination, on a
case-by-case basis, that he or she may continue to serve beyond 12 years in consideration of his or her exceptional contribution to the
Board. A Director will no longer be considered “independent” as defined in the 10 Principles of Corporate Governance of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the Listed Company Manual of the New York Stock Exchange as applicable to foreign private
issuers after he or she has completed 12 years of service on the Board.

As membership of the Board of Directors represents a significant time commitment, the policy requires both executive and non-
executive Directors to devote sufficient time to the discharge of their duties as a Director of ArcelorMittal. Directors are therefore
required to consult with the Chairman and the Lead Independent Director before accepting any additional commitment that could
conflict with or impact the time they can devote to their role as a Director of ArcelorMittal. Furthermore, a non-executive Director
may not serve on more than four public company boards in addition to the ArcelorMittal Board of Directors. However, service on the
board of directors of any subsidiary or affiliate of ArcelorMittal or of any other company on whose board the Director serves shall not
be taken into account for purposes of complying with the foregoing limitation. Directors have a time period of three years from
October 30, 2012 to reach the limit of five directorships of public companies.

Although non-executive Directors of ArcelorMittal who retire or change their principal occupation or business association are not
necessarily required to leave the Board of Directors, the policy requires each non-executive Director, following any such event, to
promptly tender his or her resignation to the ARCG Committee , so that there is an opportunity for the Board of Directors, through the
ARCG Committee, to review the continued appropriateness of Board membership of the relevant Director under the new
circumstances.

None of the members of the Board of Directors, including the executive director, have entered into service contracts with
ArcelorMittal or any of its subsidiaries that provide for any form of remuneration or for benefits upon the termination of their term.

All members of the Board of Directors are required to sign the Company’s Code of Business Conduct upon first joining the Board
and confirm their adherence thereto on an annual basis thereafter.

The remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors is determined on a yearly basis by the annual general meeting of
shareholders.

Share Transactions by Management

In compliance with laws prohibiting insider dealing, the Board of Directors of ArcelorMittal has adopted insider dealing
regulations, which apply throughout the ArcelorMittal group. These regulations are designed to ensure that insider information is

43


--- Page 44 ---

treated appropriately within the Company and avoid insider dealing and market manipulation. Any breach of the rules set out in this
procedure may lead to criminal or civil charges against the individuals involved, as well as disciplinary action by the Company.

Shareholding Requirement for Non-Executive Directors

In consideration of corporate governance trends indicating that a reasonable amount of share ownership helps better align the
interests of the directors with those of all shareholders, the Board of Directors adopted on October 30, 2012 share ownership
guidelines for non-executive Directors. The Directors are required to own 10,000 shares and the Lead Independent Director is required
to own 15,000 shares, both within five years of October 30, 2012, or if the Director is appointed after October 30, 2012, within five
years of his or her appointment.

Operation

General

The Board of Directors may engage the services of external experts or advisers as well as take all actions necessary or useful to
implement the Company’s corporate purpose. The Board of Directors (including its three committees) has its own budget, which
covers functioning costs such as external consultants, continuing education activities for Directors and travel expenses.

Meetings

The Board of Directors meets when convened by the Chairman of the Board or any two members of the Board of Directors. The
Board of Directors holds physical meetings at least on a quarterly basis as five regular meetings are scheduled per year. The Board of
Directors holds additional meetings if and when circumstances require, in person or by teleconference and can take decisions by
written circulation, provided that all members of the Board of Directors agree.

The Board of Directors held five meetings in 2012. The average attendance rate of the directors at the Board of Directors’
meetings was 96.29%. Each Director attended at least 75% of the Board meetings.

In order for a meeting of the Board of Directors to be validly held, a majority of the Directors must be present or represented,
including at least a majority of the independent Directors. In the absence of the Chairman, the Board of Directors will appoint by
majority vote a chairman for the meeting in question. The Chairman may decide not to participate in a Board of Directors’ meeting,
provided he has given a proxy to one of the Directors who will be present at the meeting. For any meeting of the Board of Directors, a
Director may designate another Director to represent him or her and vote in his or her name, provided that the director so designated
may not represent more than one of his or her colleagues at any time.

Each Director has one vote and none of the Directors, including the Chairman, has a casting vote. Decisions of the Board of
Directors are made by a majority of the directors present and represented at a validly constituted meeting.

Lead Independent Director

In April 2008, the Board of Directors created the role of Lead Independent Director. His or her function is to:
coordinate the activities of the independent Directors,

liaise between the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the independent Directors,

call meetings of the independent Directors when he or she considers it necessary or appropriate, and

perform such other duties as may be assigned to him or her by the Board of Directors from time to time.

Mr. Lewis B. Kaden was elected by the Board of Directors as ArcelorMittal’s first Lead Independent Director in April 2008 and
remains Lead Independent Director, having been re-elected as a Director for a three-year term on May 10, 2011.

The agenda of each meeting of the Board of Directors is decided jointly by the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Lead
Independent Director.

Separate Meetings of Independent Directors

The independent members of the Board of Directors may schedule meetings outside the presence of non-independent Directors.
Four meetings of the independent Directors outside the presence of management and non-independent Directors were held in 2012.

44

Annual Self-Evaluation

The Board of Directors decided in 2008 to start conducting an annual self-evaluation of its functioning in order to identify
potential areas for improvement. The first self-evaluation process was carried out in early 2009. The self-evaluation process includes
structured interviews between the Lead Independent Director and each Director and covers the overall performance of the Board of
Directors, its relations with senior management, the performance of individual Directors, and the performance of the committees. The
process is supported by the Company Secretary under the supervision of the Chairman and the Lead Independent Director. The
findings of the self-evaluation process are examined by the ARCG Committee and presented with recommendations from the ARCG
Committee to the Board of Directors for adoption and implementation. Suggestions for improvement of the Board of Directors’
process based on the prior year’s performance and functioning are implemented during the following year.

The 2012 Board of Directors’ self-evaluation was completed by the Board on February 4, 2013. Directors believe that the quality
of discussions within the Board continued to improve in 2012. The previous year’s recommendation that balance of the time spent by
the Board of Directors on strategic and other specific issues compared to time spent on the review of financial and operational results
and performance was successfully implemented. The Board has also identified a number of topics that it wishes to spend additional
time on in 2013, such as compliance, corporate values and corporate responsibility and specific country risk assessments.

The Board of Directors believes that its members have the appropriate range of skills, knowledge and experience, as well as the
degree of diversity, necessary to enable it to effectively govern the business. Board composition is reviewed on a regular basis and
additional skills and experience are actively searched for in line with the expected development of ArcelorMittal’s business as and
when appropriate.

Required Skills, Experience and Other Personal Characteristics

Diverse skills, backgrounds, knowledge, experience, geographic location, nationalities and gender are required in order to
effectively govern a global business the size of the Company’s operations. The Board and its committees are therefore required to
ensure that the Board has the right balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge necessary to perform its role in
accordance with the highest standards of governance.

The Company’s directors must demonstrate unquestioned honesty and integrity, preparedness to question, challenge and critique
constructively, and a willingness to understand and commit to the highest standards of governance. They must be committed to the
collective decision-making process of the Board and must be able to debate issues openly and constructively, and question or
challenge the opinions of others. Directors must also commit themselves to remain actively involved in Board decisions and apply
strategic thought to matters at issue. They must be clear communicators and good listeners who actively contribute to the Board in a
collegial manner. Each Director must also ensure that no decision or action is taken that places his or her interests in front of the
interests of the business. Each Director has an obligation to protect and advance the interests of the Company and must refrain from
any conduct that would harm it.

In order to govern effectively, non-executive Directors must have a clear understanding of the Company’s strategy, and a
thorough knowledge of the ArcelorMittal group and the industries in which it operates. Non-executive Directors must be sufficiently
familiar with the Company’s core business to effectively contribute to the development of strategy and monitor performance.

With specific regard to the non-executive Directors of the Company, the composition of the group of non-executive Directors
should be such that the combination of experience, knowledge and independence of its members allows the Board to fulfill its
obligations towards the Company and other stakeholders in the best possible manner.

The ARCG Committee ensures that the Board is comprised of high-caliber individuals whose background, skills, experience and
personal characteristics enhance the overall profile of the Board and meets its needs and diversity aspirations by nominating high
quality candidates for election to the Board by the general meeting of shareholders.

Board Profile

The key skills and experience of the Directors, and the extent to which they are represented on the Board and its committees, are
set out below. In summary, the non-executive Directors contribute:

© — international and operational experience;
* understanding of the industry sectors in which we operate;

° knowledge of world capital markets and being a company listed in several jurisdictions; and

45


--- Page 46 ---

¢ an understanding of the health, safety, environmental, political and community challenges that we face.
Each Director is required to adhere to the values set out in, and sign, the ArcelorMittal Code of Business Conduct.

Renewal

The Board plans for its own succession, with the assistance of the ARCG Committee. In doing this, the Board:

* considers the skills, backgrounds, knowledge, experience and diversity of geographic location, nationality and gender
necessary to allow it to meet the corporate purpose;

* — assesses the skills, backgrounds, knowledge, experience and diversity currently represented;

¢ — identifies any inadequate representation of those attributes and agrees the process necessary to ensure a candidate is selected
who brings them to the Board; and

¢ reviews how Board performance might be enhanced, both at an individual Director level and for the Board as a whole.

The Board believes that orderly succession and renewal is achieved through careful planning and by continuously reviewing the
composition of the Board.

When considering new appointments to the Board, the ARCG Committee oversees the preparation of a position specification that
is provided to an independent recruitment firm retained to conduct a global search, taking into account, among other factors,
geographic location, nationality and gender. In addition to the specific skills, knowledge and experience required of the candidate, the
specification contains the criteria set out in the ArcelorMittal Board profile.

Diversity
In line with the worldwide effort to increase gender diversity on the boards of directors of listed and unlisted companies, the

Board has set an aspirational goal of increasing the number of women on the Board to at least three by the end of 2015 based upon a
Board of Directors size of 11 members.

Director Induction, Training and Development

The Board considers that the development of the directors’ knowledge of the Company, the steel-making and mining industries,
and the markets in which the Company operates is an ongoing process. To further bolster the skills and knowledge of Directors, the
Company set up a continuous development program in 2009.

Upon his or her election, each new non-executive director undertakes an induction program specifically tailored to his or her
needs and includes ArcelorMittal’s long-term vision centered on the concept of “Safe Sustainable Steel”.

The Board’s development activities include the provision of regular updates to directors on each of the Company’s products and
markets. Non-executive directors may also participate in training programs designed to maximize the effectiveness of the Directors
throughout their tenure and link in with their individual performance evaluations. The training and development program may cover
not only matters of a business nature, but also matters falling into the environmental, social and governance area.

Structured opportunities are provided to build knowledge through initiatives such as visits to plants and mine sites and business
briefings provided at Board meetings. Non-executive directors also build their Company and industry knowledge through the
involvement of the Group Management Board and other senior employees in Board meetings. Business briefings, site v and
development sessions underpin and support the Board’s work in monitoring and overseeing progress towards the corporate purpose of
creating long-term shareholder value through the development of our business in steel and mining. We therefore continuously build
Directors’ knowledge to ensure that the Board remains up-to-date with developments within our segments, as well as developments in
the markets in which we operate.

During the year, non-executive directors participated in the following activities:

* comprehensive business briefings intended to provide each Director with a deeper understanding of the Company’s activities,
environment, key issues and strategy of our segments. These briefings are provided to the Board by senior executives,
including Group Management Board members. The briefings provided during the course of 2012 covered health and safety

46


--- Page 47 ---

processes, marketing, steel-making, mining and R&D. Certain business briefings were combined with site visits and thus
took place on-site and, in other cases, they took place at Board meetings;

¢ development sessions on specific topics of relevance, such as climate change, commodity markets, the world economy,
changes in corporate governance standards, directors’ duties and shareholder feedback; and

presentations by external experts on issues such as diversity, leadership and risk management.

The ARCG Committee oversees Director training and development. This approach allows induction and learning opportunities to
be tailored to the Directors’ committee memberships, as well as the Board’s specific areas of focus. In addition, this approach ensures
a coordinated process in relation to succession planning, Board renewal, training, development and committee composition, all of
which are relevant to the ARCG Committee’s role in securing the supply of talent to the Board.

Board of Directors Committees

The Board of Directors has three committees:

¢ the Audit Committee,

¢ the Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee, and

e the Risk Management Committee.

Audit Committee

The Audit Committee must be composed solely of independent members of the Board of Directors. The members are appointed
by the Board of Directors each year after the annual general meeting of shareholders. All of the Audit Committee members must be
independent as defined in the Rule 10A-3 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Audit Committee makes
decisions by a simple majority with no member having a casting vote.

The primary function of the Audit Committee is to as
reviewing:

the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by

¢ — the financial reports and other financial information provided by ArcelorMittal to any governmental body or the public;

¢  ArcelorMittal’s system of internal control regarding finance, accounting, legal compliance and ethics that the Board of
Directors and senior management have established; and

°

Risk Management Committee
In June 2009, the Board of Directors created a Risk Management Committee to assist it with risk management, in line with recent

developments in corporate governance best practices and in parallel with the creation of a Group Risk Management Committee at the
executive level.

The members are appointed by the Board of Directors each year after the annual general meeting of shareholders. The Risk
Management Committee must be comprised of at least two members. At least half of the members of the Risk Management
Committee must be independent under the NYSE standards and the 10 Principles of Corporate Governance of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange. The Risk Management Committee consists of three members: Mr. Jeannot Krecké, Mr. Antoine Spillmann and Ms.
Suzanne P. Nimocks. Mr. Sudhir Maheshwari, a member of the Group Management Board who chairs the Group Risk Management
Committee, is regularly invited to the meetings of the Risk Management Committee.

The members of the Risk Management Committee may decide to appoint a Chairman by majority vote. Mr. Spillmann currently
acts as Chairman.

Decisions and recommendations of the Risk Management Committee are adopted by a simple majority. The Chairman or, in the
absence of the Chairman, any other member of the Risk Management Committee, will report to the Board of Directors at each of the
latter’s quarterly meetings or more frequently if circumstances so require. The Risk Management Committee conducts an annual self-
evaluation of its own performance and completed its 2012 self-evaluation on February 4, 2013.

The purpose of the Risk Management Committee is to support the Board of Directors in fulfilling its corporate governance and
oversight responsibilities by assisting with the monitoring and review of the risk management framework and process of

48


--- Page 49 ---

ArcelorMittal. Its main responsibilities and duties are to assist the Board of Directors by making recommendations regarding the
following matters:

¢ The oversight, development and implementation of a risk identification and management process and the review and
reporting on the same in a consistent manner throughout the ArcelorMittal group;

¢ — The review of the effectiveness of the Group-wide risk management framework, policies and process at Corporate, Segment
and Business Unit levels, and the proposing of improvements, with the aim of ensuring that the Group’s management is
upported by an effective risk management system;

The Risk Management Committee held a total of four meetings in 2012. According to its charter, it is required to meet at least
four times per year on a quarterly basis or more frequently if circumstances so require. The average attendance rate in 2012 was 100%.

Transition Committee

Following the spin-off of ArcelorMittal’s stainless and specialty steels business into Aperam on January 25, 2011, an ad hoc
Transition Committee was formed by the Board of Directors in order to monitor the implementation of the transitional agreements
entered into with Aperam. The Transition Committee was created for a maximum of three years, after which an evaluation of its
purpose would take place. Its members were Mr. Vaghul, Mr. Ross and Mr. Kaden, with Mr. Kaden acting as chairman.

The Transition Committee reviewed the terms and conditions of the transitional services provided to Aperam in the course of
2012. The Transition Committee then decided that a separate committee focused on the transition was no longer nec: s the
transitional agreements with Aperam had decreased in relevance and order of magnitude, effective October 30, 2012. Respons ibility
for the remaining arrangements with Aperam has been transferred to line management with oversight by the Audit Committee in the
normal course of business.

The Transition Committee held one meeting in 2012 which one of its three members did not attend.

Group Management Board

The Group Management Board is entrusted with the day-to-day management of the Company and the implementation of its
strategy. Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, the Chief Executive Officer, chairs the Group Management Board. The members of the Group
Management Board are appointed and dismissed by the Board of Directors. As the Group Management Board is not a corporate body
created by Luxembourg law or ArcelorMittal’s Articles of Association, it exercises only the authority granted to it by the Board of
Directors.

In implementing ArcelorMittal’s strategic direction and corporate policies, the Chief Executive Officer is supported by the
members of the Group Management Board who have substantial experience in the steel and mining industries worldwide.

The Group Management Board is assisted by a Management Committee comprised of 24 members The Management Committee
discusses and prepares decisions to be made by the Group Management Board on matters of Group-wide importance, integrates the

geographical dimension of the ArcelorMittal group, ensures in-depth discussions with ArcelorMittal’s operational and resources
leaders and shares information about the situation of the Group and its markets.

Succession Planning

Succession management at ArcelorMittal is a systematic and deliberate process for identifying and preparing employees with
potential to fill key organizational positions should the current incumbent’s term expire. This process applies to all ArcelorMittal

49


--- Page 50 ---

executives up to and including the Group Management Board. Succession management aims to ensure the continued effective
performance of the organization by providing for the availability of experienced and capable employees who are prepared to assume
these roles as they become available. For each position, candidates are identified based on performance and potential and their “years
to readiness” and development needs are discussed and confirmed. Regular reviews of succession plans are conducted to ensure that
they are accurate and up to date. Succession management is a necessary process to reduce risk, create a pipeline of future leaders,
ensure smooth business continuity and improve employee motivation. Although ArcelorMittal’s predecessor companies each had
certain succession planning processes in place, the process has been reinforced, widened and made more systematic since 2006. The
responsibility to review and approve succession plans and contingency plans at the highest level rests with the Board’s ARCG
Committee.

Other Corporate Governance Practices

ArcelorMittal is committed to adhere to best practices in terms of corporate governance in its dealings with shareholders and aims
to ensure good corporate governance by applying rules on transparency, quality of reporting and the balance of powers. ArcelorMittal
continually monitors U.S., European Union and Luxembourg legal requirements and best practices in order to make adjustments to its
corporate governance controls and procedures when necessary, as evidenced by the new policies adopted by the Board of Directors in
2012.

ArcelorMittal complies with the 10 Principles of Corporate Governance of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange in all respects-
However, in respect of Recommendation 1.3, which advocates separating the roles of chairman of the board and the head of the
executive management body, the Company has made a different choice.

The nomination of the same person to both positions was approved by the shareholders (with the Significant Shareholder
abstaining) of Mittal Steel Company N.V., which was at that time the parent company of the combined ArcelorMittal group. Since that
date, the rationale for combining the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors has become even
more compelling. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that Mr. Mittal’s strategic vision for the steel industry in general and for
ArcelorMittal in particular in his role as CEO is a key asset to the Company, while the fact that he is fully aligned with the interests of
the Company’s shareholders means that he is uniquely positioned to lead the Board of Directors in his role as Chairman. The
combination of these roles was revisited at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the Company held in May 2011, when Mr.
Lakshmi N. Mittal was reelected to the Board of Directors for another three year term by a strong majority.

Ethics and Conflicts of Interest

Ethics and conflicts of interest are governed by ArcelorMittal’s Code of Business Conduct, which establishes the standards for
ethical behavior that are to be followed by all employees and directors of ArcelorMittal in the exercise of their duties. Each employee
of ArcelorMittal is required to sign and acknowledge the Code of Conduct upon joining the Company. This also applies to the
members of the Board of Directors of ArcelorMittal.

Employees must always act in the best interests of ArcelorMittal and must avoid any situation in which their personal interests
conflict, or could conflict, with their obligations to ArcelorMittal. Employees are prohibited from acquiring any financial or other
interest in any business or participate in any activity that could deprive ArcelorMittal of the time or the attention needed to devote to
the performance of their duties. Any behavior that deviates from the Code of Business Conduct is to be reported to the employee’s
supervisor, a member of the management, the head of the legal department or the head of the internal assurance department.

Code of Business Conduct training is offered throughout ArcelorMittal on a regular basis in the form of face-to-face trainings,
webinars and online trainings. Employees are periodically trained about the Code of Business Conduct in each location where
ArcelorMittal has operations. The Code of Business Conduct is available in the “Corporate Governance—Code of Business Conduct”
section of ArcelorMittal’s website at www.arcelormittal.com.

In addition to the Code of Business Conduct, ArcelorMittal has developed a Human Rights Policy and a number of other
compliance policies in more specific areas, such as anti-trust, anti-corruption, economic sanctions and insider dealing. In all these
areas, specifically targeted groups of employees are required to undergo specialized compliance training. Furthermore, ArcelorMittal’s
compliance program also includes a quarterly compliance certification process covering all business segments and entailing reporting
to the Audit Committee.

Process for Handling Complaints on Accounting Matters

As part of the procedures of the Board of Directors for handling complaints or concerns about accounting, internal controls and
auditing issues, ArcelorMittal’s Anti-Fraud Policy and Code of Business Conduct encourage all employees to bring such issues to the
Audit Committee’s attention on a confidential b: In accordance with ArcelorMittal’s Anti-Fraud and Whistleblower Policy,
concerns with regard to possible fraud or irregularities in accounting, auditing or banking matters or bribery within ArcelorMittal or
any of its subsidiaries or other controlled entities may also be communicated through the “Corporate Governance — Whistleblower”

50



--- Page 51 ---

section of the ArcelorMittal website at www.arcelormittal.com, where ArcelorMittal’s Anti-Fraud Policy and Code of Business
Conduct are also available in each of the main working languages used within the Group. In recent years ArcelorMittal has
implemented local whistleblowing facilities, as needed.

During 2012, a total of 88 complaints relating to accounting fraud were referred to the Company’s Internal Assurance department.
Following review by the Audit Committee, none of these complaints was found to be significant.

Internal Assurance

ArcelorMittal has an Internal Assurance function that, through its Head of Internal Assurance, reports to the Audit Committee.
The function is staffed by full-time professional staff located within each of the principal operating subsidiaries and at the corporate
level. Recommendations and matters relating to internal control and processes are made by the Internal Assurance function and their
implementation is regularly reviewed by the Audit Committee.

Independent Auditors

The appointment and determination of fees of the independent auditors is the direct responsibility of the Audit Committee. The
Audit Committee is further responsible for obtaining, at least once each year, a written statement from the independent auditors that
their independence has not been impaired. The Audit Committee has also obtained a confirmation from ArcelorMittal’s principal
independent auditors to the effect that none of its former employees are in a position within ArcelorMittal that may impair the
principal auditors’ independence.

Measures to Prevent Insider Dealing and Market Manipulation

The Board of Directors of ArcelorMittal has adopted Insider Dealing Regulations (“IDR”), which are updated when necessary
and in relation to which training is conducted throughout the group. The IDR’s most recent version is available on ArcelorMittal’s
website, www.arcelormittal.com.

The IDR apply to the worldwide operations of ArcelorMittal. The Company Secretary of ArcelorMittal is the IDR compliance
officer and answers questions that members of senior management, the Board of Directors, or employees may have about the IDR’s
interpretation. The IDR compliance officer maintains a list of insiders as required by the Luxembourg market manipulation (abus de
marché) law of May 9, 2006, as amended. The IDR compliance officer may assist senior executives and directors with the filing of
notices required by Luxembourg law to be filed with the Luxembourg financial regulator, the CSSF (Commission de Surveillance du
Secteur Financier). Furthermore, the IDR compliance officer has the power to conduct investigations in connection with the
application and enforcement of the IDR, in which any employee or member of senior management or of the Board of Directors is
required to cooperate.

Selected new employees of ArcelorMittal are required to participate in a training course about the IDR upon joining ArcelorMittal
and every three years thereafter. The individuals who must participate in the IDR training include the members of senior management,
employees who work in finance, legal, sales, mergers and acquisitions and other areas that the Company may determine from time to
time. In addition, ArcelorMittal’s Code of Business Conduct contai section on “Trading in the Securities of the Company” that
emphasizes the prohibition to trade on the basis of inside information. An online interactive training tool based on the IDR was
developed in 2010 and deployed across the group in different languages in 2011 through ArcelorMittal’s intranet, with the aim to
enhance the staff’s awareness of the risks of sanctions applicable to insider dealing. The importance of the IDR was re-emphasized in
writing to the persons on ArcelorMittal's insider list in July 2012.

that the Mittal Shareholder (as defined in the Articles of Association) may, at its discretion, exercise the right of proportional
representation and nominate candidates for appointment to the Board of Directors (defined as “Mittal Shareholder Nominees”). The
Mittal Shareholder has not, to date, exercised that right.

Articles 11(1)(e) and (f) of the Takeover Law are not applicable to the Company. However, the sanction of suspension of
voting rights automatically applies, subject to limited exceptions set out in the Transparency Law (as defined below), to any
shareholder (or group of shareholders) who has (or have) crossed the thresholds set out in article 7 of the Articles of Association and
articles 8 to 15 of the Luxembourg law of 11 January 2008 on the transparency requirements regarding issuers of securities (the
“Transparency Law”) but have not notified the Company accordingly. The sanction of suspension of voting rights will apply until
such time as the notification has been properly made by the relevant shareholder(s).

Article 11(1)(g) of the Takeover Law is not applicable to the Company.

Board of Directors a new share buy-back authorization whereby the Board may authorize the acquisition or sale of Company shares
including, but not limited to, entering into off-market and over-the-counter transactions and the acquisition of shares through
derivative financial instruments. Any acquisitions, disposals, exchanges, contributions or transfers of shares by the Company or other
companies in the ArcelorMittal group must be in accordance with Luxembourg laws transposing Directive 2003/6/EC regarding

shares may amount to the entire program. Such transactions may be carried out at any time, including during a tender offer period, in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Any share buy-backs on the New York Stock Exchange must be performed in
compliance with Section 10(b) and Section 9(a)(2) of the U.S: Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),

trading preceding the three trading days prior to the date of purchase. In the event of a share capital increase by incorporation of
reserves or issue premiums and the free allotment of shares as well as in the event of the division or regrouping of the shares, the
purchase price indicated above shall be adjusted by a multiplying coefficient equal to the ratio between the number of shares
comprising the issued share capital prior to the transaction and such number following the transaction. The total amount allocated for
the Company’s share repurchase program may not in any event exceed the amount of the Company’s then available equity.

Controls and procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports in accordance with applicable laws is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. ArcelorMittal’s controls and procedures are designed to provide
reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.

We carried out an evaluation under the supervision, and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
December 31, 2012. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2012 to provide reasonable assurance that (1) information
required to be disclosed by us in accordance with Luxembourg legislations is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a
timely manner in accordance with applicable laws, and (2) that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures.

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of
human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and
procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

* pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of ArcelorMittal;

* provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded, as necessary, to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with IFRS;

* provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of ArcelorMittal are made in accordance with authorizations of
ArcelorMittal’s management and directors; and

* provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ArcelorMittal’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a
misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 based upon the
framework in Jnternal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”). Based on this assessment, management concluded that ArcelorMittal’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Except as described below, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
year ending December 31, 2012 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
financial reporting.

The Company outsourced a significant part of European IT infrastructure and related general IT controls to a third-party service
provider. The outsourcing arrangement impacts all of the segments operating in Europe and ArcelorMittal’s corporate headquarters.

53


--- Page 54 ---

The outsourcing agreement covers the management of the Company’s IT infrastructure(i.e. servers, network, databases) whereas the
management of business applications, including those applications used for the purposes of processing financial reporting relevant
data are excluded from the outsourcing agreement. The outsourcing agreement also includes the management of the Company’s data
centres in Europe. The outsourcing agreement went into effect on March 1, 2012. The outsourcing agreements are expected to enhance
the cost efficiency and effectiveness our IT infrastructure. The Company anticipates that internal controls over financial reporting
could be impacted by further IT related outsourcing in the future.

Remuneration of Senior Management

The total remuneration paid in 2012 to members of ArcelorMittal’s senior management (including Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal in his
capacity as Chief Executive Officer) was $9.6 million in base salary and other benefits paid in cash (such as those relating to gasoline
and car allowances, lunch and financial services) and $10.5 million in short-term performance-related variable remuneration
consisting of a bonus linked to the Company’s 2011 results.

During 2012, approximately $800,000 was accrued by ArcelorMittal to provide pension benefits to senior management (other
than Mr. Mittal).

No loans or advances to ArcelorMittal’s senior management were made during 2012, and no such loans or advances were
outstanding as of December 31, 2012.

As discussed above, in 2012, the Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors
decided to further improve the remuneration disclosure published by the Company by focusing on those executive officers whose
remuneration is tied to the performance of the entire ArcelorMittal group. Consequently, information regarding the Management
Committee, which is an advisory body to the Group Management Board, is no longer included. The Group Management Board is
defined going forward as ArcelorMittal’s senior management.

The following table shows the remuneration received by the Chief Executive Officer and the Group Management Board members
as determined by the ARCG Committee in relation to 2012 and 2011, including all remuneration components.

respectively (effective April 2012), as compared to 2011.
2 Other benefits comprise benefits paid in cash such as health insurance and other insurance, lunch, financial services, gasoline and car
allowances. Benefits in kind such as company car and tax returns are not included.
3 Short-term incentives are entirely performance-based and are fully paid in cash. The short-term incentive for a given year relates to the
Company’s results in the previous year.
4 Fair value determined at the grant date is recorded as an expense using the straight line method over the vesting period and adjusted for the

effect of non market-based vesting conditions. The remuneration expenses recognized for the RSUs/PSUs granted to the Chief Executive
Officer and other Group Management Board members was $99,000 and $606,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012.

The Company allocated 2012 remuneration according to the following timeline:

Clawback Policy

Under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the SEC may seek to recover remuneration from the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer of the Company in the event that it is required to restate accounting information due to any material
misstatement thereof or as a result of misconduct in respect of a financial reporting requirement under the U.S. securities laws (the
“SOX Clawback”).

Under the SOX Clawback, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer may have to reimburse ArcelorMittal for
any bonus or other incentive- or equity-based remuneration received during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or
filing with the SEC (whichever occurs first) of the relevant filing, and any profits realized from the sale of ArcelorMittal securities
during that 12-month period.

The Board of Directors, through its Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee, decided in 2012 to
adopt its own clawback policy (the “Clawback Policy”) that applies to the members of the Group Management Board and to the
Executive Vice President of Finance, of ArcelorMittal.

The Clawback Policy comprises cash bonuses and any other incentive-based or equity-based remuneration, as well as profits from
the sale of the Company’s securities received during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the SEC
(whichever first occurs) of the filing that contained the material misstatement of accounting information.

For purposes of determining whether the Clawback Policy should be applied, the Board of Directors will evaluate the
circumstances giving rise to the restatement (in particular, whether there was any fraud or misconduct), determine when any such
misconduct occurred and determine the amount of remuneration that should be recovered by the Company. In the event that the Board
of Directors determines that remuneration should be recovered, it may take appropriate action on behalf of the Company, including,
but not limited to, demanding repayment or cancellation of cash bonuses, incentive-based or equity-based remuneration or any gains
realized as the result of options being exercised or awarded or long-term incentives vesting. The Board may also choose to reduce
future remuneration as a means of recovery.

Remuneration Policy

Board Oversight

The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Group’s remuneration arrangements are equitable and aligned with the long-term
interests of the Company and its shareholders. It is therefore critical that the Board remain independent of management when making
decisions affecting remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer and its direct reports.

To this end, the Board has established the Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee (“ARCG
Committee”) to assist it in making decisions affecting employee remuneration. All members of the ARCG Committee are required to
be independent under the Company’s corporate governance guidelines, the NYSE standards and the 10 Principles of Corporate
Governance of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

57


--- Page 58 ---

The members are appointed by the Board of Directors each year after the annual general meeting of shareholders. The members
have relevant expertise or experience relating to the purposes of the committee. The ARCG Committee makes decisions by a simple
majority with no member having a casting vote.

The ARCG Committee is chaired by Mr. Lewis Kaden, Lead Independent Director.

Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee

The primary function of the ARCG Committee is to assist the Board of Directors, among others with respect to the following:

* review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to the Group Management Board and other members of executive
management as deemed appropriate by the committee regarding their remuneration, and assess performance against goals and
objectives;

¢ make recommendations to the Board with respect to incentive remuneration plans and equity-based plans;
¢ — identify candidates qualified to serve as members of the Board and the Group Management Board;

* recommend candidates to the Board for appointment by the general meeting of shareholders or for appointment by the Board
to fulfill interim Board vacancies;

¢ develop, monitor and review corporate governance principles applicable to the Company;
¢ facilitate the evaluation of the Board;
* — review the succession planning and the executive development of Group Management Board members;

* submit proposals to the Board on the remuneration of Group Management Board members, and on the appointment of new
directors and Group Management Board members;

* make recommendations to the Board on the Company’s framework of remuneration for the Group Management Board and
such other members of the executive management as designated by the committee. In making such recommendations, the
committee may take into account factors that it deems necessary (the remuneration of directors on the Board shall be a matter
to be decided by the Board). This may include total cost of employment (including equity/stock options based component)
and determination on behalf of the Board specific remuneration packages and conditions of employment (including pension
rights).

The ARCG Committee met six times in 2012. Its members comprise Mr. Lewis Kaden (Chairman), HRH Prince Guillaume de
Luxembourg, Mr. Narayanan Vaghul and Ms. Suzanne P. Nimocks. Regular invitees include Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal (Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman) and Mr. Willie Smit (Head of Group Human Resources). Mr. Henk Scheffer (Group Company Secretary) acts
as secretary. The relevant persons are not present when their remuneration is discussed by the ARGC Committee. The ARCG
Committee Chairman presents its decisions and finding to the Board of Directors after each Committee meeting.

Remuneration Strategy
Scope

ArcelorMittal’s remuneration philosophy and framework apply to the following group of senior managers:

¢ the Chief Executive Officer; and

¢ — the seven other members of the Group Management Board.

The remuneration philosophy and governing principles also apply, with certain limitations, to a wider group of employees
including Executive Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents, General Managers and Managers.

Remuneration Philosophy
ArcelorMittal’s remuneration philosophy for its senior managers is based on the following principles:

* provide total remuneration competitive with executive remuneration levels of a peer group composed of a selection of
industrial companies of a similar size and scope;

58


--- Page 59 ---

* — encourage and reward performance that will lead to long-term enhancement of shareholder value;
* promote internal pay equity and provide “market” median (determined by reference to its identified peer group) base pay
levels for ArcelorMittal’s senior managers with the possibility to move up to the third quartile of the market base pay levels,

depending on performance over time; and

* promote internal pay equity and target total direct remuneration (base pay, bonus, and long term incentives) levels for senior
managers at the 75th percentile of the market.

Remuneration Framework

The ARCG Committee develops proposals on senior management remuneration annually for consideration by the Board of
Directors. Such proposals include the following components:

¢ fixed annual salary;
¢ — short-term incentives (i.e., performance-based bonuses); and
¢ — long-term incentives (i.e., stock options (prior to May 2011), RSUs (after May 2011) and PSUs (after May 2011).

The decision was taken by the Board of Directors not to allocate any RSUs and PSUs to the members of Group Management
Board between May 2012 and May 2013.

Fixed Annual Salary

Base salary levels are reviewed annually and compared to the market to ensure that ArcelorMittal remains competitive with
market median base pay levels.

Short-Term Incentives
Annual Performance Bonus Plan

ArcelorMittal has a short-term incentive plan consisting of a performance-based bonus plan. Bonus calculations for each
employee reflect the performance of the ArcelorMittal group as a whole, the performance of the relevant business units, the

achievement of objectives specific to the department and the individual employee’s overall performance and potential.

The calculation of ArcelorMittal’s 2012 performance bonus is aligned with its strategic objectives of improving health and safety
performance and overall competitiveness and the following principles:

* no performance bonus will be triggered if the achievement level of the performance measures is less than the threshold
of 80%;

* achievement of 100% of the performance measure yields 100% of the performance bonus pay-out; and

* achievement of more than 100% and up to 120% of the performance measure generates a higher performance bonus pay-
out, except as explained below.

The performance bonus for each individual is expressed as a percentage of his or her annual base salary. Performance bonus pay-
outs may range from 50% of the target bonus for achievement of performance measures at the threshold (80%), to up to 150% for an
achievement at or in excess of the ceiling of 120%. Between the 80% threshold and the 120% ceiling, the performance bonus is
calculated on a proportional, straight-line basis.

For the Chief Executive Officer and the other members of the Group Management Board, the 2012 bonus formula is based on:

¢ EBITDA at the Group level: 60% (this acts as “circuit breaker” with respect to group-level financial performance
measures as explained below);

¢ Free cash flow (“FCF”) (operating free cash flow (“OFCF’”) was used in 2011) at the Group level: 20%; and

¢ Health and safety performance at the Group level: 20%.

59


--- Page 60 ---

EBITDA operating as a “circuit breaker” for financial measures means that the 80% threshold described above must be met for
EBITDA in order to trigger any bonus payment with respect to the EBITDA and FCF performance measures.

For the Chief Executive Officer, the performance bonus at 100% achievement of performance targets linked to the business plan
is equal to 100% of his base salary. For the members of the Group Management Board, the performance bonus at 100% achievement
of performance targets linked to the business plan is equal to 80% of the relevant base salary.

The different performance measures are combined through a cumulative system: each measure is calculated separately and is
added up for the performance bonus calculation.

Performance below threshold will result in zero performance bonus payout.

The achievement level of performance for performance bonus is summarized as follow:

Target achievement Target achievement @ Target achievement >
Functional level threshold @ 80% 100% ceiling @ 120%
Chief Executive Officer 50% of base pay 100% of base pay 150% of base pay
Other GMB members 40% of base pay 80% of base pay 120%of base pay

Individual performance and potential assessment ratings define the individual bonus multiplier that will be applied to the
performance bonus calculated based on actual performance against the performance measures. Those individuals who consistently
perform at expected levels will have an individual multiplier of 1. For outstanding performers, an individual multiplier of up to 1.3
may cause the performance bonus pay-out to be higher than 150% of the target bonus, up to 195% of target bonus being the absolute
maximum. Similarly, a reduction factor will be applied for those at the lower end.

The principles of the performance bonus plan, with different weights for performance measures and different levels of target
bonuses, are applicable to approximately 2,000 employees worldwide.

In exceptional cases, there are some entitlements to a retention bonus or a business specific bonus.
At the end of the financial year, achievement against the measures is assessed by the ARCG Committee and the Board and the

short-term incentive award is determined. The achievement of the 2011 Performance Bonus Plan with respect to senior management
and paid out in March 2012 was as follows:

% Weighting for Chief Executive

2011 Measures Officer and GMB members Assessment

EBITDA 60% Incentive attributable to this metric as the assessment was over target
OFCF 20% No incentive attributable to this metric

Health and Safety 20% Incentive attributable to this metric as the assessment was at target

Extra Mid-Year Bonus 2012

In 2012, the Group Management Board decided to implement a mid-year bonus plan for 2012 in addition to the Annual
Performance Bonus Plan to encourage a greater focus on the Group’s objective of achieving a substantial net debt reduction by June
30, 2012. The two measures of this bonus were EBITDA and FCF, and also took into account additional targets to be achieved in the
first half of 2012, consisting of higher EBITDA, limitation of capital expenditure and improvement of working capital, subject to the
conditions below:

¢ Only units/segments delivering results (both EBIDTA and FCF) that are better than the 2012 business plan taking into
account the additional targets would qualify for an extra bonus;

¢ Interms of EBITDA, an improvement of 10% over the approved business plan was expected; and

¢ The mid-year bonus would be paid out in full if 100% of the additional EBITDA and FCF targets are met but would not be
paid out if the level of achievement was below 80%, with the maximum level of achievement being set at 120%.

Based on the Company’s 2012 mid-year results, no additional mid-year bonus was paid to the Chief Executive Officer or any
other members of the Group Management Board.

Other Benefits

In addition to the remuneration described above, other benefits may be provided to members of the Group Management Board
and, in certain cases, other employees. These other benefits can include insurance, housing (in cases of international transfers), car
allowances and tax assistance.

Long-Term Incentives: Equity Based Incentives
Share Unit Plans

The annual shareholders’ meeting on May 10, 2011 approved a new equity-based incentive plan to replace the Global Stock
Option Plan. The new plan comprises a Restricted Share Unit Plan (“RSU Plan”) and a Performance Share Unit Plan (“PSU Plan”)
designed to incentivize employees, improve the Company’s long-term performance and retain key employees. Both the RSU Plan and
the PSU Plan are intended to align the interests of the Company’s shareholders and eligible employees by allowing them to participate
in the success of the Company.

The maximum number of Restricted Share Units (each, an “RSU”) and Performance Share Units (each, a “PSU”) available for
grant during any given year is subject to the prior approval of the Company’s shareholders at the annual general meeting. The annual
shareholders’ meeting on May 8, 2012 approved the maximum to be granted until the next annual shareholders’ meeting.

RSU Plan

The aim of the RSU Plan is to provide a retention incentive to eligible employees. It is subject to “cliff vesting” after three years,
with 100% of the grant vesting on the third anniversary of the grant contingent upon the continued active employment of the eligible
employee within the ArcelorMittal group. The RSUs are an integral part of the Company’s remuneration framework.

For the period from the May 2012 annual general shareholders’ meeting to the May 2013 annual general shareholders’ meeting, a
maximum of 2,500,000 RSUs may be allocated to eligible employees under the RSU Plan. The RSU Plan targets the 500 to 700 most
senior managers across the ArcelorMittal group. The decision was taken by the Board of Directors not to allocate any RSUs to the
members of the Group Management Board between May 2012 and May 2013. The Company expects to make a grant under the RSU
Plan by the end of the first quarter of 2013 to the other eligible managers.

PSU Plan

The PSU Plan’s main objective is to be an effective performance-enhancing scheme based on the employee’s contribution to the
eligible achievement of the Company’s strategy. Awards under the PSU Plan are subject to the fulfillment of cumulative performance
criteria over a three-year period from the date of the PSU grant. The employees eligible to participate in the PSU Plan are a sub-set of
the group of employees eligible to participate in the RSU Plan. The target group for PSU grants is primarily the Chief Executive
Officer, the other members of the Group Management Board, the Executive Vice Presidents and the Vice Presidents.

For the period from the May 2011 annual general shareholders’ meeting to the annual general meeting of shareholders held in
May 2012 a maximum of 1,000,000 PSUs could have been allocated to eligible employees under the PSU Plan. The allocation of
PSUs took place in March 2012 and a total of 264,165 performance shares units were granted to a total of 118 employees.

For the period from the May 2012 annual general shareholders’ meeting to the May 2013 annual general shareholders’ meeting, a
maximum of 1,000,000 PSUs may be allocated to eligible employees under the PSU Plan. The decision was taken by the Board of
Directors not to grant any PSUs to the members of the Group Management Board between May 2012 and May 2013. The Company
expects to make a grant under the PSU Plan by the end of the first quarter of 2013 to the other eligible managers of the Company.

PSUs will vest three years after their date of grant subject to the eligible employee’s continued employment with the Company
and the fulfillment of targets related to the following performance measures: return on capital employed (ROCE) and total cost of
employment (in U.S. dollars per tonne) for the steel business (TCOE) and the mining volume plan 2012 and ROCE for the Mining
segment. Each performance measure has a weighting of 50%. In case the level of achievement of both performance targets together is
below 80%, there is no vesting, and the rights are automatically forfeited.

The allocation of RSUs and PSUs to members of the Group Management Board under the RSU Plan and the PSU Plan is
reviewed by the ARCG Committee, comprised of four independent directors, which makes a recommendation to the full Board of
Directors. The ARCG Committee also reviews the proposed grants of RSUs and PSUs to eligible employees other than the members
of the Group Management Board and the principles governing their proposed allocation. The Committee also decides the criteria for
granting PSUs and makes its recommendation to the Board of Directors.

Global Stock Option Plan

61


--- Page 62 ---

Prior to the adoption in 2011 of the Share Unit Plans described above, ArcelorMittal’s equity-based incentive plan took the form
of a stock option plan known as the Global Stock Option Plan.

Under the terms of the ArcelorMittal Global Stock Option Plan 2009-2018 (which replaced the ArcelorMittal Shares plan that
expired in 2009), ArcelorMittal may grant options to purchase ordinary shares to senior management of ArcelorMittal and its
associates for up to 100,000,000 ordinary shares. The exercise price of each option equals not less than the fair market value of
ArcelorMittal shares on the grant date, with a maximum term of 10 years. Options are granted at the discretion of ArcelorMittal’s
ARCG Committee, or its delegate. The options vest either ratably upon each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, or, in
total upon the death, disability or retirement of the participant.

With respect to the spin-off of Aperam, the ArcelorMittal Global Stock Option Plan 2009-2018 was amended to reduce by 5% the
exercise prices of existing stock options. This change is reflected in the information given below.

Year of Grant Initial Exercise Prices (per option) New Exercise Prices (per option)

August 2008 $82.57 $78.44
December 2007 74.54 70.81

September 2006 33.76 32.07
August 2010 32.27 30.66
August 2005 28.75 2731

December 2008 23.75 22.56
November 2008 22.25 21.14
April 2002 2.26 2.15

On August 3, 2010, ArcelorMittal granted 5,864,300 options under the ArcelorMittal Global Stock Option Plan 2009-2018 to a
group of key employees at an exercise price of $32.27 per share. The new exercise price is $30.66 per share after the spin-off of
Aperam. The options expire on August 3, 2020. No options were granted in 2011 and 2012, although RSUs and PSUs were granted;
see “—RSU Plan” and “— PSU Plan” above.)

The fair values for options and other share-based remuneration are recorded as expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations over the relevant vesting or service periods, adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of vesting. The fair value of each
option grant to purchase ArcelorMittal common shares is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option
pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions (based on year of grant and recalculated at the spin-off date of the
stainless steel business):

2010
Exercise Price $30.66
Dividend yield 2.02%
Expected annualized volatility 50%
Discount rate—bond equivalent yield 3.21%
Weighted average share price $30.66
Expected life in years 5.75
Fair value per option $17.24

The expected life of the options is estimated by observing general option holder behavior and actual historical lives of
ArcelorMittal stock option plans. In addition, the expected annualized volatility has been set by reference to the implied volatility of
options available on ArcelorMittal shares in the open market, as well as, historical patterns of volatility.

The remuneration expense recognized for stock option plans was $73 million and $25 million for each of the years ended
December 31, 2011, and 2012, respectively. At the date of the spin-off of Aperam, the fair value of the stock options outstanding have
been recalculated with the modified inputs of the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, including the weighted average share
price, exercise price, expected volatility, expected life, expected dividends, the risk-free interest rate and an additional expense of $11
million has been recognized in the year ended December 31, 2011 for the current and past periods.

Option activity with respect to ArcelorMittalShares and the ArcelorMittal Global Stock Option Plan 2009-2018 is summarized
below as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012:

For RSUs, the fair value determined at the grant date is recorded as an expense using the straight line method over the vesting
period and adjusted for the effect of nonmarket-based vesting conditions. The remuneration expense recognized for the RSUs granted
was $2 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012.

For PSUs, the fair value determined at the grant date is recorded as an expense using the straight line method over the vesting
period and adjusted for the effect of nonmarket-based vesting conditions. The remuneration expense recognized for the RSUs granted

$1 million for the years ended December 31, 2012.

As from 2013, the Group Management Board including the Chief Executive Officer will no longer be entitled to RSU grants.

Performance Consideration
Remuneration Mix

The target total remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer and the Group Management Board is structured to attract and retain

Share Ownership

As of December 31, 2012, the aggregate beneficial share ownership of ArcelorMittal directors and senior management (17
individuals) totaled 1,990,733 ArcelorMittal shares (excluding shares owned by ArcelorMittal’s Significant Shareholder and
including options to acquire 1,358,735 ArcelorMittal ordinary shares that are exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2012),
representing 0.13% of the total issued share capital of ArcelorMittal. Excluding options to acquire ArcelorMittal ordinary shares,
these 17 individuals beneficially own 631,998 ArcelorMittal ordinary shares. Other than the Significant Shareholder, each director
and member of senior management beneficially owns less than 1% of ArcelorMittal’s shares. For purposes of this section,
ordinary shares held directly by Mr. Lakshmi Mittal and his wife, Mrs. Usha Mittal, and options held directly by Mr. Lakshmi
Mittal are aggregated with those ordinary shares beneficially owned by the Significant Shareholder.

ArcelorMittal issued 104,477,612 ordinary shares in an offering that closed on January 14, 2013 (the “Share Offering”) and
issued $2,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Mandatorily Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the
“Convertible Notes”) in an offering that closed on January 16, 2013. The Significant Shareholder, through Lumen Investments S.a
r.l., subscribed for 17,910,448 ordinary shares in the Share Offering and acquired $300 million in principal amount of Convertible
Notes. Following the ordinary shares subscription, the percentage of total ordinary shares (including options to acquire
ArcelorMittal ordinary shares exercisable within 60 days) owned by the Significant Shareholder decreased from 40.88% to
39.39%.

In 2011, the number of ArcelorMittal RSUs granted to directors and senior management (including the Significant
Shareholder) was 82,500; upon vesting of the RSUs, the corresponding treasury shares or new shares will be transferred to the
beneficiaries on September 29, 2014. In 2012, the number of ArcelorMittal PSUs granted to directors and senior management
(including the Significant Shareholder) was 49,500; upon vesting of the PSUs, the corresponding treasury shares or new shares
will be transferred to the beneficiaries on March 30, 2015.

Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP)

The annual general shareholders’ meeting held on May 11, 2010 adopted an Employee Share Purchase Plan (the “ESPP
2010”) as part of a global employee engagement and participation policy. As with the previous Employee Share Purchase Plans
implemented in 2008 and 2009, the ESPP 2010’s goal was to strengthen the link between the Group and its employees and to
align the interests of ArcelorMittal employees and shareholders. The main features of the plan, which was implemented in
November 2010, were the following:

The ESPP 2010 was offered to 183,560 employees in 21 jurisdictions. ArcelorMittal offered a maximum total number of
2,500,000 shares (0.16% of the current issued shares on a fully diluted basis). A total of 164,171 shares were subscribed, 1,500 of
which were subscribed by members of the Group Management Board and the Management Committee of the Company. The
subscription price was $34.62 before discounts.

Pursuant to the ESPP 2010, eligible employees could apply to purchase a number of shares not exceeding that number of
whole shares equal to the lower of 200 shares and the number of whole shares that may be purchased for $15,000, rounded down
to the nearest whole number of shares.

The purchase price was equal to the average of the opening and the closing prices of the ArcelorMittal shares trading on the
NYSE on the exchange day immediately preceding the opening of the subscription period, which is referred to as the “reference
price’, less a discount equal to:

(a) 15% of the reference price for a purchase order not exceeding the lower of 100 shares and the number of shares
(rounded down to the nearest whole number) corresponding to an investment of $7,500 (the first cap); and thereafter,

(b) 10% of the reference price for any additional acquisition of shares up to a number of shares (including those in the
first cap) not exceeding the lower of 200 shares and the number of shares (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) corresponding to an investment of $15,000 (the second cap).

All shares purchased under the ESPP 2008, 2009 and 2010 are held in custody for the benefit of the employees in global
accounts with BNP Paribas Securities Services, except for shares purchased by Canadian and U.S. employees, which are held in
custody in one global account with Computershare.

Shares purchased under the plan are subject to a three-year lock-up period as from the settlement date, except for the
following early exit events: permanent disability of the employee, termination of the employee’s employment or death of the
employee. At the end of this lock-up period, the employees will have a choice either to sell their shares (subject to compliance
with ArcelorMittal’s insider dealing regulations) or keep their shares and have them delivered to their personal securities account,
or make no election, in which case shares will be automatically sold. Shares may be sold or released within the lock-up period in
the case of early exit events. During this period, and subject to the early exit events, dividends paid on shares are held for the
employee’s account and accrue interest. Employee shareholders are entitled to any dividends paid by ArcelorMittal after the
settlement date and they are entitled to vote their shares.

With respect to the spin-off of ArcelorMittal’s stainless and specialty steels business, an addendum to the charter of the 2008,
2009 and 2010 ESPPs was adopted providing, among other measures, that:

¢ the spin-off shall be deemed an early exit event for the participants who will be employees of one of the entities that will
be exclusively controlled by Aperam, except in certain jurisdictions where termination of employment is not an early exit
event; and

* the Aperam shares to be received by ESPP participants will be blocked in line with the lock-up period applicable to the
ArcelorMittal shares in relation to which the Aperam shares are allocated based on a ratio of one Aperam share for 20
ArcelorMittal shares.

In connection with ArcelorMittal’s Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) 2010, employees subscribed for a total of
164,171 ArcelorMittal shares (with a ceiling of up to 200 shares per employee) out of a total of 2,500,000 shares available for
subscription. The shares subscribed by employees under the ESPP 2010 program were treasury shares. Due to the
low participation level in previous years and the complexity and high cost of setting up an ESPP, management decided not to
implement another ESPP in 2011 and the same decision has been adopted with respect to 2012.

Mayor Shareholders and Related Party Transactions

In connection with the spin-off of the Company’s stainless and specialty steels business into Aperam on January 25, 2011,
the Company’s issued share capital was reduced to 5,428 005,991.80 without any reduction in the number of shares issued which
remained at 1 560,914,610 and was unchanged at December 31, 2012.

The Company’s authorized share capital, including the issued share capital, was €7 082,460,000, represented by
1,617,000,000 shares at December 31, 2011, and was increased by the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders held on May
8, 2012 to €7,725 260,599.18, represented by 1 ,773,091,461 shares.

--- Page 67 ---

The May 8, 2012 extraordinary general meeting of shareholders approved an increase of the Company’s authorized share
capital by 10% of its then issued share capital, i.e., by €542,800,599.18, represented by 156,091,461 shares without nominal
value, resulting in an authorized share capital of €7,725,260,599.18 represented by 1,773,091 ,461 shares without nominal value.
The meeting also granted the Board of Directors the authority, for a period of five years, to issue additional shares in the Company
within the limit of the new authorized share capital, and to limit or suppress the preferential subscription right of existing
shareholders in this regard.

On January 14, 2013, the Company increased its share capital by issuing out of its authorized share capital 104,477,612
ordinary shares at a price of $16.75 per share, resulting in an issued share capital of €5,883,209,119.84 represented by
1,665 392,222 ordinary shares. The Company's authorized share capital of €7,725,260,559.18 was not impacted by this
transaction.

Following the issue of new shares on January 14, 2013, 107,699,239 ordinary shares remain available for issuance under the
Company's authorized share capital.

In connection with the $2.25 billion 6% Mandatorily Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2016 issued by the Company on
January 16, 2013, in addition to the other convertible notes outstanding of the Company, the Company will ask the general
meeting of shareholders to approve an increase in its authorized share capital in order to meet any conversion requests from
noteholders.

1 For purposes of this table, a person or group of persons is deemed to have beneficial ownership of any ArcelorMittal ordinary shares as

of a given date on which such person or group of persons has the right to acquire such shares within 60 days after December 31, 2012
upon exercise of vested portions of stock options. Only the last third of the stock options granted on August 3, 2010 remain unvested;
all other stock options of the previous grants have vested.

2 For purposes of this table, ordinary shares owned directly by Mr. Lakshmi Mittal and his wife, Mrs. Usha Mittal, and options held
directly by Mr. Lakshmi Mittal, are aggregated with those ordinary shares beneficially owned by the Significant Shareholder. At
December 31, 2012, Mr. Lakshmi Mittal and his wife, Mrs. Usha Mittal, had direct ownership of ArcelorMittal ordinary shares and
indirect ownership, through the Significant Shareholder, of two holding companies that own ArcelorMittal ordinary shares—Nuavam
Investments S.a r.l. (“Nuavam”) and Lumen Investments S.a r.l. (“Lumen”). Nuavam, a limited liability company organized under the
laws of Luxembourg, was the owner of 112,338,263 ArcelorMittal ordinary shares. Lumen, a limited liability company organized
under the laws of Luxembourg, was the owner of 525,000,000 ArcelorMittal ordinary shares. Mr. Mittal was the direct owner of
301,600 ArcelorMittal ordinary shares and held options to acquire an additional 436,500 ArcelorMittal ordinary shares, of which
417,667 are, for the purposes of this table, deemed to be beneficially owned by Mr. Mittal due to the fact that these options are
exercisable within 60 days. Mrs. Mittal was the direct owner of 45,000 ArcelorMittal ordinary shares. Mr. Mittal, Mrs. Mittal and the
Significant Shareholder shared indirect beneficial ownership of 100% of each of Nuavam and Lumen (within the meaning set forth in
Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act). Accordingly, Mr. Mittal was the beneficial owner of 638,057,530 ArcelorMittal ordinary shares,
Mrs. Mittal was the beneficial owner of 637,383,263 ordinary shares and the Significant Shareholder was the beneficial owner of
638,102,530 ordinary shares. Excluding options, Mr. Lakshmi Mittal and Mrs. Usha Mittal together beneficially owned 637,684,863
ArcelorMittal ordinary shares at such date.

3 Represents ArcelorMittal ordinary shares repurchased pursuant to share repurchase programs in prior years, fractional shares returned
in various transactions, and the use of treasury shares in various transactions in prior years; excludes (1) 1,358,735 stock options that
can be exercised by senior management (other than Mr. Mittal) and (2) 417,667 stock options that can be exercised by Mr. Mittal, in
each case within 60 days of December 31, 2012. Holders of these stock options are deemed to beneficially own ArcelorMittal ordinary
shares for the purposes of this table due to the fact that such options are exercisable within 60 days.

4 Includes shares beneficially owned by directors and members of senior management; excludes shares beneficially owned by Mr.
Mittal.
5 These 1,990,733 ArcelorMittal ordinary shares are included in shares owned by the public shareholders indicated above.

On January 16, 2013, ArcelorMittal issued $2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of its 6% Mandatorily Convertible Notes
due 2016, of which Lumen subscribed for $300 million in principal amount. Based on the methodology used in the above two
tables, as of December 31, 2012, giving effect to the share offering and Lumen share subscription noted above and assuming (i) no
drawing under the share lending agreement between Lumen and ArcelorMittal discussed below and (ii) conversion of all
mandatorily convertible notes, the percentage of ordinary shares owned by the Significant Shareholder would be 37.45%
(assuming conversion of all notes at the maximum conversion ratio) or 37.81% (assuming conversion of all notes at the minimum.
conversion ratio).

The ArcelorMittal ordinary shares may be held in registered form only. Registered shares may consist of;

a. shares traded on the NYSE, or New York Registry Shares, which are registered in a register kept by or on behalf of
ArcelorMittal by its New York transfer agent,

b. shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam by NYSE Euronext, Euronext Paris by NYSE Euronext, the regulated market of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the Spanish Stock Exchanges (Madrid, Bilbao, Valencia and Barcelona), which are
registered in ArcelorMittal’s shareholders’ register, or

c. ArcelorMittal European Registry Shares, which are registered in a local shareholder register kept by or on behalf of
ArcelorMittal by BNP Paribas Securities Services in Amsterdam, or directly on ArcelorMittal’s Luxembourg shareholder
register without being held on ArcelorMittal’s local Dutch shareholder register.

Under Luxembourg law, the ownership of registered shares is evidenced by the inscription of the name of the shareholder, the
number of shares held by such shareholder and the amount paid up on each share in the shareholder register of ArcelorMittal.

At December 31, 2012, there were 2,613 shareholders other than the Significant Shareholder, holding an aggregate of
52,876,675 ArcelorMittal ordinary shares registered in ArcelorMittal’s shareholder register, representing approximately 3.39% of
the ordinary shares issued (including treasury shares).

At December 31, 2012, there were 229 U.S. shareholders holding an aggregate of 77,694,463 New York Shares, representing
approximately 4.98% of the ordinary shares issued (including treasury shares). ArcelorMittal’s knowledge of the number of New
York Shares held by U.S. holders is based solely on the records of its New York transfer agent regarding registered ArcelorMittal
ordinary shares.

At December 31, 2012, 793,005,209 ArcelorMittal ordinary shares were held through the Euroclear/Iberclear clearing system
in The Netherlands, France, Luxembourg and Spain.

Related Party Transactions

ArcelorMittal engages in certain commercial and financial transactions with related parties, including associates and joint
ventures of ArcelorMittal. Please refer to Note 15 of ArcelorMittal’s consolidated financial statements.

Shareholder’s Agreement

The Significant Shareholder, a holding company owned by the Significant Shareholder and ArcelorMittal are parties to a
shareholder and registration rights agreement (the “Shareholder’s Agreement”) dated August 13, 1997. Pursuant to the
Shareholder’s Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, ArcelorMittal shall, upon the request of certain holders
of restricted ArcelorMittal shares, use its reasonable efforts to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the sale of
ArcelorMittal shares intended to be sold by those holders. By its terms, the Shareholder’s Agreement may not be amended, other
than for manifest error, except by approval of a majority of ArcelorMittal’s shareholders (other than the Significant Shareholder
and certain permitted transferees) at a general shareholders’ meeting.

Acquisition of ordinary shares and mandatorily convertible notes in the January 2013 offering of such securities by
ArcelorMittal, and entry into the Lock-Up Letter and Share Lending Agreement in connection therewith

ArcelorMittal issued 104,477,612 ordinary shares in an offering that closed on January 14, 2013 (the “Share Offering”) and
issued $2,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Mandatorily Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the

68


--- Page 69 ---

“Convertible Notes”) in an offering that closed on January 16, 2013. Lumen subscribed for 17,910,448 ordinary shares in the
Share Offering and acquired $300 million in principal amount of Convertible Notes. The underwriting agreement entered into in
connection with such offerings provided as a closing condition that Lumen and Nuavam each execute a lock-up letter whereby
they would each agree not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any ordinary shares, the acquired Convertible Notes or other securities exchangeable for or
convertible into ordinary shares owned by them for a period of at least 180 days from January 9, 2013, subject to certain limited
exceptions or the prior written consent of the representatives. In connection with the Share Offering and the offering of the
Convertible Notes, ArcelorMittal entered into a share lending agreement with Lumen on January 9, 2013, pursuant to which
Lumen agreed to make available for borrowing by ArcelorMittal up to a maximum amount of 48.9 million ordinary shares in
exchange for a loan fee of $0.00046 per lent ordinary share, accruing daily from and including the date on which the loaned
ordinary shares are delivered to the borrower to, but excluding, the date of return of the borrowed ordinary shares. Under the
Share Lending Agreement, deliveries of the loaned shares by Lumen occur on the dates an equal number of ordinary shares are
required to be delivered by ArcelorMittal pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Notes. The share lending agreement provides.
that ArcelorMittal may terminate all or any portion of any loan made thereunder at any time and that all outstanding loans shall
terminate on the date which is three business days after the date on which a general meeting of shareholders of ArcelorMittal has
approved a resolution approving sufficient authorized share capital and authorizing the Board of Directors of the Company to
cancel the preferential subscription right of existing shareholders to allow return to Lumen of all borrowed ordinary shares. Under
the Share Lending Agreement, Lumen will have no rights (including voting or disposition rights) with respect to any ordinary
shares that have been loaned to ArcelorMittal and not yet returned to Lumen. Subject to this condition being met, it is expected
that any ordinary shares to be delivered by ArcelorMittal to Lumen upon termination of the loan(s) will be newly issued ordinary
shares issued in favor of Lumen (with a cancellation of the shareholders' preferential subscription right).

Agreements with Aperam in Connection with Stainless Steel Spin-Off

In connection with the spin-off of its stainless steel division into a separately focused company, Aperam, which was
completed on January 25, 2011, ArcelorMittal entered into several agreements with Aperam. These agreements include a Master
Transitional Services Agreement dated January 25, 2011 (the “Transitional Services Agreement”), a purchasing services
agreement and a sourcing services agreement, certain commitments regarding cost-sharing in Brazil and certain other ancillary
arrangements governing the relationship between Aperam and ArcelorMittal following the spin-off, as well as certain agreements
relating to financing.

The Transitional Services Agreement between ArcelorMittal and Aperam expired at year-end 2012. The parties agreed to
renew a limited number of services that ArcelorMittal will continue to provide during 2013 relating to certain areas, including
environmental and technical support, IT services relating to the Global Wide Area Network contract, press clipping
communication, ArcelorMittal University training in human resources, maintenance and customization of back office finance
software and registered shareholder management.

In the area of research and development, Aperam entered into an arrangement with ArcelorMittal to establish a framework for
future cooperation between the two groups in relation to certain ongoing or new research and development programs. Moreover,
Aperam and ArcelorMittal are keeping open the possibility to enter into ad hoc cooperation agreements for future research and
development purposes.

The purchasing and sourcing of raw materials generally were not covered by the Transitional Services Agreement. Aperam is
responsible for the sourcing of its key raw materials, including nickel, chromium, molybdenum and stainless steel scrap. However,
under the terms of the purchasing services agreement and the sourcing services agreement, Aperam relies on ArcelorMittal for
advisory services in relation to the negotiation of certain contracts with global or large regional suppliers, including those relating
to the following key categories: energy (electricity, natural gas, industrial gas), raw materials (ferro-alloys, certain base materials),
operating materials (rolls, electrodes, refractories) and industrial products and services. The purchasing services agreement also
permits Aperam to avail itself of the services and expertise of ArcelorMittal for certain capital expenditure items not specific to
stainless and specialty steel production. The purchasing services agreement and the sourcing services agreement were entered into
for a term of two years, which expired on January 24, 2013. It is expected that the purchasing services agreement will be extended
for an additional year on modified terms. It is expected that the sourcing servicing agreement will also be extended for an
additional year, but that its scope will be limited to IT maintenance and support until Aperam switches to its own system.

In connection with the spin-off, management also renegotiated an existing Brazilian cost-sharing agreement between, inter
alia, ArcelorMittal Brasil and Aperam Inox América do Sul S.A. (formerly known as ArcelorMittal Inox Brasil), pursuant to
which starting as of April 1, 2011, ArcelorMittal Brasil continued to perform only purchasing, insurance and real estate activities
for the benefit of certain of Aperam’s Brazilian subsidiaries, with costs being shared on the basis of cost allocation parameters
agreed between the parties. Since the demerger of ArcelorMittal BioEnergia Ltda in July 2011, its payroll functions have also
been handled by ArcelorMittal Brasil. The real estate activities of Aperam’s Brazilian subsidiaries have not been handled by
ArcelorMittal Brasil since January 1, 2013.

Certain services will continue to be provided to Aperam pursuant to existing contracts with ArcelorMittal entities that it has
specifically elected to assume.

Financing Agreements

As of the spin-off, Aperam’s principal sources of financing included loans from ArcelorMittal entities at the level of
ArcelorMittal Inox Brasil, which holds Aperam’s assets in Brazil, and ArcelorMittal Stainless Belgium, which holds Aperam’s
assets in Belgium. These facilities were refinanced in connection with the spin-off.

On January 19, 2011, ArcelorMittal Finance as lender and ArcelorMittal and Aperam as borrowers entered into a $900
million credit facility for general corporate purposes and for the refinancing of existing intercompany and other debt (the “Bridge
Loan”). The Bridge Loan was entered into for a period of 364 days after January 25, 2011. The Bridge Loan was made available
to ArcelorMittal and then automatically transferred by operation of law to Aperam in connection with its spin-off. The Bridge
Loan was fully repaid by Aperam with the proceeds of (i) a borrowing base facility agreement dated March 15, 2011 and (ii) an
offering of notes by Aperam on March 28, 2011.

Share Lending Agreement

In connection with ArcelorMittal’s issuance of 104,477,612 ordinary shares in an offering that closed on January 14, 2013
(the “Share Offering”) and $2,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Mandatorily Convertible Subordinated Notes due
2016 (the “Convertible Notes”) in an offering that closed on January 16, 2013, the Company entered into a share lending
agreement with Lumen on January 9, 2013, pursuant to which Lumen agreed to make available for borrowing by ArcelorMittal up
to a maximum amount of 48.9 million ordinary shares in exchange for a loan fee of $0.00046 per lent ordinary share, accruing
daily from and including the date on which the loaned ordinary shares are delivered to the borrower to, but excluding, the date of
return of the borrowed ordinary shares. Under the Share Lending Agreement, deliveries of the loaned shares by Lumen occur on
the dates an equal number of ordinary shares are required to be delivered by ArcelorMittal pursuant to the terms of the
Convertible Notes. The share lending agreement provides that ArcelorMittal may terminate all or any portion of any loan made
thereunder at any time and that all outstanding loans shall terminate on the date which is three business days after the date on
which a general meeting of shareholders of ArcelorMittal has approved a resolution approving sufficient authorized share capital
and authorizing the Board of Directors of the Company to cancel the preferential subscription right of existing shareholders to
allow return to Lumen of all borrowed ordinary shares. Under the Share Lending Agreement, Lumen will have no rights
(including voting or disposition rights) with respect to any ordinary shares that have been loaned to ArcelorMittal and not yet
returned to Lumen. Subject to this condition being met, it is expected that any ordinary shares to be delivered by ArcelorMittal to

Restricted Share Unit and Performance Share Unit Plans

On May 11, 2011, the annual shareholders’ meeting approved a new equity-based incentive plan to replace the Global Stock
Option Plan. The plan comprises an RSU Plan and a PSU Plan, as further described above in the section “Compensation -

the end of the first quarter of 2013. Such grant, which will exclude members of the Group Management Board, will be subject to
the Supplemental Terms for the 2012-2013 RSU Plan and PSU Plan. A copy of the Supplemental Terms for the 2012-2013 RSU
Plan and PSU Plan is filed as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 20-F.

Memorandum of Understanding

On June 25, 2006, Mittal Steel, the Significant Shareholder and Arcelor signed a binding Memorandum of Understanding
(“MoU”) to combine Mittal Steel and Arcelor in order to create the world’s leading steel company. In April 2008, the Board of
Directors approved resolutions amending certain provisions of the MoU in order to adapt it to the Company’s needs in the post-
merger and post-integration phase, as described above under “Lead Independent Director”.

On the basis of the MoU, Arcelor’s Board of Directors recommended Mittal Steel’s offer for Arcelor and the parties to the
MoU agreed to certain corporate governance and other matters relating to the combined ArcelorMittal group. Certain provisions
of the MoU relating to corporate governance were incorporated into the Articles of Association of ArcelorMittal at the
extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders on November 5, 2007.

Certain additional provisions of the MoU expired effective August 1, 2009. ArcelorMittal’s corporate governance rules will
continue to reflect, subject to those provisions of the MoU that have been incorporated into the Articles of Association, the best
standards of corporate governance for comparable companies and to conform with the corporate governance aspects of the NYSE
listing standards applicable to non-U.S. companies and Ten Principles of Corporate Governance of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange.

The following summarizes the main provisions of the MoU that remain in effect or were in effect in 2012.

Standstill

The Significant Shareholder agreed not to acquire, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of an amount of shares in the
capital stock of the Company exceeding the percentage of shares in the Company that it will own or control following completion
of the Offer (as defined in the MoU) for Arcelor and any subsequent offer or compulsory buy-out, except with the prior written
consent of a majority of the independent directors on the Company’s Board of Directors. Any shares acquired in violation of this.
restriction will be deprived of voting rights and shall be promptly sold by the Significant Shareholder. Notwithstanding the above,
if (and whenever) the Significant Shareholder holds, directly and indirectly, less than 45% of the then-issued Company shares, the
Significant Shareholder may purchase (in the open market or otherwise) Company shares up to such 45% limit. In addition, the
Significant Shareholder is also permitted to own and vote shares in excess of the threshold mentioned in the immediately
preceding paragraph or the 45% limit mentioned above, if such ownership results from (1) subscription for shares or rights in
proportion to its existing shareholding in the Company where other shareholders have not exercised the entirety of their rights or
(2) any passive crossing of this threshold resulting from a reduction of the number of Company shares (e.g., through self-tender
offers or share buy-backs) if, in respect of (2) only, the decisions to implement such measures were taken at a shareholders’
meeting in which the Significant Shareholder did not vote or by the Company’s Board of Directors with a majority of independent
directors voting in favor.

Once the Significant Shareholder exceeds the threshold mentioned in the first paragraph of this “Standstill” subsection or the
45% limit, as the case may be, as a consequence of any corporate event set forth in (1) or (2) above, it shall not be permitted to
increase the percentage of shares it owns or controls in any way except as a result of subsequent occurrences of the corporate
events described in (1) or (2) above, or with the prior written consent of a majority of the independent directors on the Company’s
Board of Directors.

If subsequently the Significant Shareholder sells down below the threshold mentioned in the first paragraph of this
“Standstill” subsection or the 45% limit, as the case may be, it shall not be permitted to exceed the threshold mentioned in the first
paragraph of this “Standstill” subsection or the 45% limit, as the case may be, other than as a result of any corporate event set out
in (1) or (2) above or with the prior written consent of a majority of the independent directors.

Finally, the Significant Shareholder is permitted to own and vote shares in excess of the threshold mentioned in the first
paragraph of this “Standstill” subsection or the 45% limit mentioned above if it acquires the excess shares in the context of a
takeover bid by a third party and (1) a majority of the independent directors of the Company’s Board of Directors consents in
writing to such acquisition by the Significant Shareholder or (2) the Significant Shareholder acquires such shares in an offer for all
of the shares of the Company.

Lock-up

The Significant Shareholder had agreed for a five year period not to transfer (and to cause its affiliates not to transfer) directly
or indirectly any of the shares in the Company without the approval of a majority of the independent directors of the Company.
This lock-up provision expired on August 1, 2011.

Non-compete

For so long as the Significant Shareholder holds and controls at least 15% of the outstanding shares of the Company or has
representatives on the Company’s Board of Directors or Group Management Board, the Significant Shareholder and its affiliates
will not be permitted to invest in, or carry on, any business competing with the Company, except for PT. ISPAT Indo.

Minority shareholders litigation

On January 8, 2008, ArcelorMittal received a writ of summons on behalf of four hedge fund shareholders of Arcelor to
appear before the civil court of Luxembourg. The summons was also served on all natural persons sitting on the Board of
Directors of ArcelorMittal at the time of the merger and on the Significant Shareholder. The plaintiffs alleged in particular that,
based on Mittal Steel’s and Arcelor’s disclosure and public statements, investors had a legitimate expectation that the exchange
ratio in the second-step merger would be the same as that of the secondary exchange offer component of Mittal Steel’s June 2006
tender offer for Arcelor (i.e., 11 Mittal Steel shares for seven Arcelor shares), and that the second-step merger did not comply with
certain provisions of Luxembourg company law. They claimed, inter alia, the cancellation of certain resolutions (of the Board of
Directors and of the Shareholders meeting) in connection with the merger, the grant of additional shares or damages in an amount
of €180 million. By judgment dated November 30, 2011, the Luxembourg civil court declared all of the plaintiffs’ claims
inadmissible and dismissed them. This judgment was appealed in mid-May 2012. The appeal proceedings are pending.

On May 15, 2012, ArcelorMittal received a writ of summons on behalf of Association Actionnaires d'Arcelor (AAA), a
French association of former minority shareholders of Arcelor, to appear before the civil court of Paris. On comparable grounds,
AAA claims inter alia damages in an amount of €50,049 and reserves the right to seek additional remedies including the
cancellation of the merger. The proceedings before the civil court of Paris are pending.

positive start to the year, our share price declined from February through May as global markets reacted to the slowdown in China
and its impact on raw materials prices and steel prices. Our share price and that of our peer group recovered in the fourth quarter
as the rising iron ore price signalled that activity levels in China were increasing.
