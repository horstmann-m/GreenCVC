Group Management Report 2015

1. Overview Of The Economic Environment
and the Past Financial Year

The global semiconductor sector showed a muted
development in 2015 and was influenced by an
increasingly volatile macroeconomic environment
in key regions. Total sales of the global semicon-
ductor industry remained almost unchanged in
2015, increasing slightly by 0.2% to USD 336.4bn
while market volume in 2014 had increased by
9.9% to USD 335.8bn. The relevant market segment
for ams, analog semiconductors, showed a higher
growth of 2.5% to USD 45.5bn in 2015 (previous
year: USD 44.4bn)”.

More than 30 years of experience in the analog
segment, high performance IC solutions, and
continuous innovation give ams a competitive
edge. The company’s clear focus within the analog
semiconductor market and significant investments
in research and development strengthened ams’
position as a leading supplier of advanced sensor
and analog IC solutions in 2015. ams’ strongly
positive business development last year was driven
by the market success of high volume products at
major OEMs which resulted in full year revenues
growing by 34% to EUR 623.1m.

ams is regarded as a valued technology partner
with strong competence in sensors, sensor interfa-
ces, power management- and wireless solutions of-
fering ultra-low energy consumption and excellent
analog performance. Through its worldwide sales
and support network ams has a strong presence

in the relevant markets in Europe, Asia, and North
America as more than 8,000 customers globally
rely on ams’ expertise and innovation to solve their
technological challenges.

ams’ business segment Products comprises the
markets Consumer & Communications and Auto-
motive, Industrial, Medical.

The company’s Consumer & Communications
business recorded significant growth in 2015 which
was predominantly driven by ams’ market position
as a major supplier of advanced sensor and analog
solutions for smartphones, tablet PCs and mobile
devices.

ams' light sensor product area recorded the largest
share of group revenues again last year as ams
remained the worldwide market leader in advan-
ced light sensors. ams holds a particularly strong
position in light sensor solutions for mobile devices
and supplies a broad range of leading smartphone
and tablet PC vendors given its technological edge.
As a result, ams once again shipped substantial
volumes of its high value ambient light and pro-
ximity sensors for a wide variety of smartphones
and other devices in 2015. The company’s compact
gesture sensor module combining gesture sensing
with RGB color sensing, proximity sensing, and
additional functions also continued to ship in high
volumes to leading smartphone OEMs last year.

ams sees strong growth opportunities in the
coming years based on more advanced uses of its
light sensor technology such as True Color Sensing
and Spectral Sensing. These include biosensors to
capture personal health data and innovative light
sensor applications. In biosensors, ams launched its
first product generation last year and expects the
market launch of its second product generation
offering additional features in the coming months.

ams’ wireless product area (RFID and NFC) de-
veloped very strongly in the first half of 2015 as
high volume shipments of ams’ NFC antenna boos-
ter solution contributed significantly to the growth
of the company. The wireless business was, howe-
ver, impacted by significantly lower shipments of
NFC products in the second half of 2015 due to
customer-specific developments. Implementing its
strategic NFC roadmap, ams concluded a license
agreement for its NFC boost technology last year
and presented its combined NFC analog front-end
solution. Against this background, ams continues
to expect its wireless business to contribute mea-
ningfully to the company’s business development
over the next years.

In audio solutions, MEMS microphone interface
products showed another good performance in
2015 with very high shipments of around 1.6 billion
units. As the clear market leader in a dynamic mar-
ket environment ams focuses on high value appli-
cations for mobile devices. In the recent market for
active noise cancellation (ANC) ams saw increasing
market traction for its low power solution targeting
in-box bundled earphones for smartphones. ams
expects further growth for this product area in the
current and coming years.

ams’ industrial, medical and automotive businesses
also recorded positive results in 2015 leveraging
their wide range of end markets, product lines, and
customers for better market penetration.

ams’ industrial business showed attractive growth
in 2015 mainly driven by an overall positive
demand environment in the company’s industrial
markets. ams strengthened its position as a lea-
ding supplier of sensors and sensor interfaces for
industrial and factory automation, building control,
and industrial sensing last year. ams benefits from

a broad portfolio of advanced sensor technologies
and solutions for high performance applications
and is driving innovation to support Industry 4.0
and the Internet of Awareness. ams launched the
first generation of its integrated sensor-driven ligh-
ting manager into the emerging market for smart
industrial LED lighting last year. ams sees strong
market dynamics in lighting and expects this area
to unfold into a volume opportunity in the coming
years.

ams added the CMOS environmental sensor
business for integrated temperature, pressure and
relative humidity sensors in 2015. Together with
ams’ gas sensor capabilities, this complete range of
technologies offers very attractive growth potential
in new sensor applications for industrial, home au-
tomation, and other end markets over the next ye-
ars. ams expects to sample first generation CMOS
environmental sensors to identified customers in
the near future.

The acquisition of CMOSIS was another milestone
in the past financial year adding a leading high
value industrial and medical image sensor business
with a sound revenue base. ams expects the use of
multiple sensors in industrial applications to acce-
lerate offering good growth potential for vendors
with a broad-based sensor portfolio. At the same
time, CMOSIS' strong IP creates significant future
growth opportunities in new markets and innovati-
ve applications.

ams’ medical business performed well in 2015 de-
monstrating ams’ know-how in advanced sensors
and sensor interfaces. In the core area of Medical
Imaging (computed tomography (CT), digital X-ray,
and mammography) the company’s high resolution
imaging solutions lead the market and create sig-
nificant diagnostic and patient benefits for higher

43


--- Page 3 ---

quality healthcare. ams was able to build on this
strong position and its partnerships with leading
medical systems OEMs last year and sees a good
pipeline of projects including new customers.

The company’s automotive business recorded solid
growth in 2015 given a positive demand environ-
ment in the global automotive market. ams’ high
performance sensor and position measurement
solutions, battery management, and solutions for
safety systems such as LIDAR collision avoidance
continued to be successful in an increasing number
of platforms. Focusing on its sensor strengths, ams
is well positioned to benefit from rising semicon-
ductor and sensor content in vehicles over the
coming years.

ams’ business segment Foundry which manufac-
tures analog and mixed-signal ICs for customers
using specialty processes performed well in 2015
and contributed attractively to the company’s
results. The business segment is positioned as a

full service provider offering a broad spectrum of
services from design support to final test and holds
a leading market position as an analog foundry for
specialty processes.

ams made further significant investments last

year to expand its wafer fabrication facility at the
company’s headquarters. The two-stage project
for capacity expansion that ams had started in the
previous year was successfully completed in 2015.
In addition, ams was able to conclude an attrac-
tive agreement with the State of New York (USA)
covering the construction of a new analog wafer
fab in the U.S. which ams will lease on a long-term
basis. The start of operation as well as production
ramp of the new facility which is expected to offer
significant cost benefits is planned for the first half
of 2018. As a result, ams can follow a flexible long-
term manufacturing strategy to support the future
growth and further development of the company
in the best possible manner.

2. Business Results

2.1 Development of Revenues

Consolidated group revenues for the financial

year 2015 increased by 34% to a record high of
EUR 623.1m compared to EUR 464.4m in 2014.
This very positive development was primarily due
to robust demand in the target market Consumer
& Communications (C&C) (+37%) as well as good
overall demand for ams’ solutions in the Automoti-
ve, Industry and Medical markets (AIM). The strong
revenue growth in the company’s Consumer &

Communications business was driven by the mar-
ket success of major smartphone OEMs relying on
innovative ams solutions. The positive trend in ams’
Automotive, Industry and Medical business, on the
other hand, resulted primarily from an attractive
industrywide development of demand.

The distribution of revenues by region does not
reflect the demand situation in ams’ target markets
but the geographic billing location of the compa-
ny’s customers. Business in the Asia/Pacific region
developed very positively in 2015 with revenues
growing considerably compared to the previous
year. This development was particularly due to a
major customer in Asia.

The expansion of the company’s sales and distri-
bution network continued last year enabling the
addition of new customers and a higher market
presence in all regions. Against this backdrop, ams
expects all regions to continue to contribute to the
overall growth of the company.

2.2 Orders Received and Order Backlog

Given robust order patterns in key markets, orders
received increased significantly over the course of
the year growing by 13% from EUR 504.6m in the
previous year to EUR 569.4m in 2015.

Revenues and orders developed as follows:

ams’ year-end order backlog decreased by 9% to

a solid level of EUR 119.4m on December 31, 2015
(EUR 131.3m at year-end 2014) creating an approp-
riate starting point for 2016.

2.3 Earnings

Gross profit increased substantially to EUR 339.2m
in 2015 compared to EUR 253.2m in the previous
year.

The company’s full year gross margin excluding
acquisition-related amortization remained unch-
anged at 56% (2014: 56%) while gross margin in-
cluding acquisition-related amortization decreased
slightly to 54% compared to 55% in the previous
year. This positive result was mainly due to the full
utilization of the company’s production capacity in
2015, an attractive product mix, economics of sca-
le, and efficiency improvements. At the same time,
selling prices for the company’s products showed a
slight overall decline during the year.

Research and development costs as well as mar-
keting and sales expenses showed an increase in
2015 compared to the previous year which was
due to significant product development efforts, the

strengthening of the sales network and a further
increase in personnel cost. Administrative costs
were also higher compared to the year before due
to an increase in personnel costs.

Given the strong revenue growth in relation to a
comparatively lower increase in fixed costs, the
operating result (EBIT) including acquisition-re-
lated amortization for the year 2015 increased
strongly by EUR 41.9m to the record level of EUR
147.3m. In parallel to the increase in EBIT, EBITDA
(earnings before interest and taxes plus deprecia-
tion and amortization) increased by EUR 52.5m to
EUR 195.2m.

Net income for 2015 increased to EUR 148.7m com-
pared to EUR 97.5m in 2014. The return on equity
rose to 22% compared to 18% for 2014 while the
return on revenues grew by 3 percentage points to
24% (2014: 21%).

2.4 Assets and Financial Position

The balance sheet structure shows a high ratio of
fixed to total assets which is common to the semi-
conductor industry. The share of intangibles and
property, plant and equipment in the total assets
increased from 54% in the year 2014 to 69% in the
reporting period.

The investments in fixed assets affecting cash
(capital expenditures) of EUR 80.1m were higher
than the current depreciation and amortization
of EUR 47.9m and amounted to 13% of full year
revenues (2014: 15%). The ratio of equity to fixed
assets reached 80% in 2015 compared to 104% in
the previous year, thus reflecting the investments
in fixed assets, acquisitions and strategic invest-
ments.

In the past financial year ams acquired a majority
share in the CMOSIS group as well as the CMOS
sensor activities of NXP Semiconductors in a strate-
gic transaction.

The fixed assets include a deferred tax asset of
EUR 34.8m (previous year: EUR 34.1m). Under the
current tax legislation, this tax asset can be carried

forward indefinitely but is expected to be used to
offset profit taxes within the next five years.

Inventories amounted to EUR 79.8m at the end of
2015 (2014: EUR 59.9m). This increase was particu-
larly driven by the strong increase in revenues at a
continuing high level of capacity utilization and a

comparable level of inventory turnover.

Trade receivables at balance sheet date increased
to EUR 88.7m due to the impact of fourth quarter
revenues (2014: EUR 79.0m). The average period of
outstanding receivables showed a slight increase
compared to the previous year.

Financial liabilities increased by EUR 90.6m to

EUR 275.2m from EUR 184.6m in 2014, as a result

of drawn long-term credit lines (exploiting the
historically low interest rate levels) for acquisitions
and strategic investments. For the same reason, net
debt increased to EUR 131.3m in 2015 compared
to a net cash position of EUR 45.0m in 2014. Group
equity increased by 22% to EUR 678.9m due to the
positive development of the net result.

Total assets 1,223.4 955.0 Total equity and liabilities 1,223.4 955.0

Given the higher gross debt the company’s debt-
to-equity ratio increased to 40% compared to 33%

in the previous year. At the same time, the equity
ratio decreased to 56% (2014: 58%).

These key figures are directly derivable from the group financial statements.

2.5 Cash Flow

The operating cash flow increased to EUR 155.6m
in 2015 compared to EUR 124.1m in the previ-
ous year. This improvement was primarily due to
the strong growth of the company’s operating
result. The cash flow from investing activities

was EUR -287.2m (2014: EUR -108.9m) including
EUR 80.1m of expenditures for intangible assets,
property, plant and equipment (2014: EUR 70.1m)

and EUR 201.5m for company acquisitions

(2014: EUR 35.8m). Free cash flow amounted

to EUR -131.6m (2014: 15.1m). The company’s
available liquidity decreased by EUR 100.1m to

EUR 103.6m at the end of 2015. The cash flow from
financing activities amounted to EUR 21.7m in
2015 compared to EUR 101.0m in the previous year.

3 Research and development

ams’ technological leadership in the design and
manufacture of high performance sensors and ana-
log ICs is based on more than 30 years of intensive
research and development activities. In order to se-
cure and strengthen its leading position, the com-
pany makes significant investments in research and
development on a continuous basis. Research and
development expenses amounted to EUR 107.8m
last year (17% of revenues) compared to EUR 77.0m
in the year before (17% of revenues). Research and
development activities mainly comprised the areas
Sensors and Sensor Interfaces, Power Management

and Wireless for product development as well as
the development of specialty variants of CMOS and
SiGe processes for high-voltage and high-frequen-
cy applications. The average number of employees
in research and development was 548 in 2015
(2014: 390).

ams’ R&D activities again allowed the filing of a
large number of international patents and the pub-
lication of numerous papers in international specia-
list journals and at trade conferences last year.

4 Purchasing and manufacturing

In purchasing, ams was able to reduce the cost of
raw materials and assembly services slightly last
year which had a positive effect on the gross profit
margin. Given continuously rising personnel costs
the cost pressures in manufacturing nevertheless
remain high.

Internal production capacity was fully utilized
throughout the year 2015. As a consequence, the
average capacity utilization across all manufactu-
ring areas was 100% over the reporting period. Any
unabsorbed fixed costs have been recorded in the
income statement.

Gross margin excluding acquisition-related amor-
tization remained unchanged at 56% compared to
2014 while gross margin including acquisition-re-
lated amortization decreased slightly to 54% from
55% in the previous year. This stable development
was mainly due to a favorable product mix, high
capacity utilization in manufacturing and econo-
mics of scale.

Given the positive demand environment for its
products ams expects another year of very high
capacity utilization for 2016.


--- Page 10 ---

5 Employees

On average, ams had 1,921 employees in 2015
(2014: 1,636) of which 1,040 worked at the com-
pany headquarters in Premstatten (2014: 922). The
increase of 285 employees comprises the addition
of 159 employees in research and development,
68 employees in production and 58 employees in
General and Administration.

ams recognizes its responsibility as an important
employer in the region. The company again offered
a wide range of internal and external training and
development opportunities for all employees last
year and provided training positions for apprenti-
ces,

ams attempts to retain its employees with the
help of a long-term remuneration model. A profit
sharing program for all ams employees augments

6 Environment

Acting responsibly towards the environment is a
basic principle for ams in all business operations.
ams is dedicated to meeting the highest environ-
mental standards as well as using resources and
the environment conservatively. ams has therefore
been certified to ISO 14001:2004 for a number of
years.

Sustainability as well as efforts to preserve en-
vironmental resources and reduce energy costs
and carbon dioxide emissions are major concerns
for ams which have been supported by a range
of activities for many years. Based on a thorough

the existing employee stock option and incentive
programs by way of an attractive direct compo-
nent. The profit sharing program expresses ams’
belief that the company’s employees are its most
important success factor and honors every emplo-
yee's contribution to ams’ success.

Owing to the attractive increase in earnings in
2015, the total amount for distribution which
depends on the operating profit before taxes in re-
lation to full year revenues (EBT margin) increased
significantly and totals EUR 15.7m for 2015 (2014:
EUR 13.9m).

Moreover, active internal and employee communi-
cations as well as regular employee events which
form a company tradition serve to ensure the
employees’ identification with the company.

analysis of ams’ carbon dioxide emission sources
in 2009, measures to achieve further reductions in
carbon dioxide emissions are being defined each
subsequent year.

ams also submits information on its carbon dioxide
emissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project, a
global transparency initiative which has created
the world’s largest freely available database of
corporate carbon dioxide emissions.

8 Risk management

Operating on a global basis, the ams Group is expo-
sed to a variety of risks that are inextricably linked
to business activities. In order to identify, evaluate
and counteract these risks in a timely manner, ams
has developed and implemented tight internal risk
management systems. This risk management sys-
tem was implemented and benchmarked against
best practices in conjunction with the company’s
auditors. The risk management process in place re-
quires the business units to constantly monitor and

Business Interruption Risk

The company’s state-of-the-art 200mm manufactu-
ring facility went into operation in 2002. Although
14 years old the facility is regarded as compara-
tively new by semiconductor industry standards.
Therefore the risk of breakdowns or prolonged
downtime is relatively low. In addition, this risk

is being minimized further by preventive main-
tenance activities. The business interruption risk is

production activities in testing, while the subsidi-
ary in Korea is responsible for sales and assembly
in the region. Branch facilities exist in Hong Kong,
Singapore and Taiwan.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk - the possible fluctuation in value
of financial instruments due to changes in market
interest rates — arises in relation to medium and
long-term receivables and payables (especially
borrowings). ams’ treasury policy ensures that
part of the interest rate risk is reduced by fixed-in-
terest borrowings. On the liability side, 45% of all
amounts owed to financial institutions are at fixed

Patent Infringement Risk

ams manufactures complex ICs using various
process technologies, line widths and production
facilities. Like industry competitors, the company
constantly has to develop these technologies
further. Should ams infringe any existing patents
while consistently monitoring processes, pro-

only show up after installation and use of the finis-
hed products. Although this risk has been approp-
riately insured, quality problems could negatively
impact ams’ assets, financial and earnings position.

under patent law as well as related comprehensive
licensing, this may negatively impact the assets,
financial and earnings position of the company as
well as the ams share price.

9 Events after the Balance Sheet Date

No transactions had a significant effect on ams' financial position, assets or earnings after the closing of

the fiscal year.

10 Outlook

Despite the prevailing uncertainties about the
development of the world economy, global indus-
trial production and private consumption in the
current year, ams expects its business to continue
to grow in 2016 based on the market launch of
new advanced sensor and analog solutions and the
implementation of various design-wins.

For the analog segment of the worldwide semicon-
ductor industry market researchers assume market
volume to expand further in 2016 and currently
expect year-on-year growth in the low single-di-
git percentage range (WSTS, February 2016). In

contrast, ams is confident at this time to achieve a
revenue growth rate above the expected market
growth rate for the current year. Moreover, ams
expects gross profit margin for the year 2016 to re-
main high and foresees a commensurate develop-
ment of the operating and net result in the current
year given further increases in R&D and sales and
marketing expenses.

However, should global semiconductor demand
and the macroeconomic environment develop
unfavorably in 2016 and/or the US dollar show
notable weakness, ams would experience a mea-


--- Page 14 ---

ningful impact on the development of its business
and earnings.

ams’ outstanding expertise in sensor and analog
solutions offers significant growth opportunities
for the company given a wide range of applica-
tions in smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile
devices, the integration of innovative sensor
