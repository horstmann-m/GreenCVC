Amadeus continued to advance positively through the fourth quarter and delivered a successful set of results
for the year. In 2015, Revenue and EBITDA’ grew by 14.5% and 12.2% respectively, supporting Adjusted
Profit? growth of 10.4%. These results were driven by strong performances in our Distribution and IT Solutions
businesses, by the contribution from our 2014/15 acquisitions and by a sustained positive foreign exchange
impact, in line in the quarter, with what we have seen during the year.

In Distribution, we continued to renew or sign content agreements during the fourth quarter, including 8
carriers, securing and expanding comprehensive content for our travel agency subscribers. Our air volumes
continued to grow driven by a 1.3 p.p. improvement of our competitive position? in the quarter, further
increasing our relevance to travel providers. As in past quarters, North America continued to be our fastest-
growing region, growing at a double-digit growth rate. Our overall air TA bookings grew 8.3% and Distribution
Revenue increased by 11.5%, driven by a 1.7 p.p. enhancement of our competitive position in 2015.

Merchandising is extremely important for airlines and we are committed to supporting our airline partners in
achieving their goals. Our Amadeus Ancillary Services solution is deployable in almost all markets worldwide
and has been contracted by 135 airlines (101 now implemented). Also, Amadeus’ Fare Families Solution,
allowing airlines to distribute branded fares, currently has 29 airline customers of which 22 have been
implemented. Adoption rates on the travel agency side are also progressing. In 2015, we saw an almost 100%
increase in travel agency sales of ancillaries through the Amadeus system (albeit, from a small base). The
number of online travel agencies (OTAs) subscribed to Amadeus having had airline ancillaries integrated into
their systems tripled in 2015. At present, over 45% of air bookings made through our subscribing travel
agencies can offer sales of merchandising products such as ancillary services or airline Fare Families.

1EBITDA was impacted by extraordinary costs associated with the acquisition of Navitaire incurred in 2015 (€6.7 million) and with the
acquisition of i:FAO in 2014 (€1.6 million). Excluding these costs, EBITDA grew by 12.6%, to €1,472.1 million.

2 Excluding after-tax impact of the following items: (i) accounting effects derived from PPA exercises and impairment losses, (ii) changes in fair
value of interest rate hedging agreements and non-operating exchange gains (losses) and (iii) other non-recurring items. Adjusted profit was
impacted by extraordinary costs associated with the acquisition of Navitaire incurred in 2015 and with the acquisition of i:FAO in 2014.
Excluding these impacts, Adjusted profit increased by 10.9% to €756.3 million.

In 2015, IT Solutions revenue expanded by 22.1%. This growth was supported by PB increase of 7.5%,
positively impacted by Korean Air’s migration in the latter part of 2014 and the migrations of All Nippon Airways
(international passengers business) and the Thomas Cook Group Airlines, in the second and fourth quarters of
2015, respectively. In 2015 we continued expanding our Altéa contracted pipeline, including among others and
most importantly Brussels Airlines, which completed its implementation together with Swiss International Air
Lines (both part of the Lufthansa Group) at month-end January 2016. All our activities within Airline IT had a
positive evolution in the quarter, as in the year, supported by successful upselling activity with new customers
for DCS, e-commerce and standalone solutions as well as by overall organic growth.

Post-closing, we were pleased to announce receiving all the necessary regulatory approvals for the completion
of our acquisition of Navitaire, which took place on January 26, 2016. A US-based PSS provider, Navitaire is
focused on the low-cost and hybrid-carrier segments of the airline industry, with a global customer base of over
50 carriers. The addition of Navitaire's portfolio of products and solutions will complement our own and give
Amadeus the ability to serve a new airline segment more effectively.

Our expansion into other verticals (Airport IT) or into additional transversal areas (Payments), also continue to
deliver growth. We have recently announced our launch of the Amadeus B2BWallet, a full suite of virtual cards
(from prepaid to credit) which provide travel sellers with considerable efficiencies in the payment process to
travel providers and which are fully integrated to the travel sellers’ workflows.

We also continue making positive progress in our Hotel IT strategy by integrating our recent acquisitions (Hotel
SystemsPro and Itesso) and by advancing, together with InterContinental Hotels Group, in the development of
a new-generation Guest Reservation System for the hotel industry.

Investing in technology is fundamental to our success. In 2015, R&D at Amadeus amounted to 16.4% of
revenue. R&D was devoted primarily to new customer implementations, product evolution and portfolio
expansion - including new businesses, as well as to transversal projects such as our shift to open systems, all
supporting the future growth of Amadeus.

In 2015, our free cash flow grew 10.5% to €659.2 million and consolidated covenant net financial debt as of
December 31, 2015 stood at €1,611.6 million, representing 1.09 times last twelve months’ EBITDA (an
estimated 1.56x proforma for our Navitaire acquisition).

In December 2015, the Board of Directors also proposed a 50% pay-out target ratio for 2015. Accordingly, the
Board of Directors will submit a final gross dividend of €0.775 per share from the 2015 reported profit to the
General Shareholders Meeting for approval in June 2016, representing an increase of 10.7% vs. the 2014
dividend. An interim gross dividend of €0.34 per share was paid in January 2016.

2 Operating Review

2.1 Key business highlights for the year
The following include selected business highlights for the full year 2015:
Distribution

On average over 80% of the airline bookings made through the Amadeus system worldwide are made with
airlines that have a content agreement. During the year new signings, or renewals of existing content
agreements, were reached with 37 carriers including Air Canada, which serves 38 million passengers a year,
Aeromexico, the largest airline in Mexico, and Czech Airlines.

Customers have continued contracting merchandising solutions. As of year end 135 airlines had signed-up
to Amadeus Airline Ancillary Services with 101 customers having implemented the solution. Amadeus Airline
Ancillary Services now supports airlines in deploying ancillary services in almost all markets globally. In
turn, Amadeus Fare Families Solution, which allows airlines to distribute branded fares, had 29 contracts in
place and 22 customers had already implemented the solution.

Included within these was Air Canada, which will take advantage of both Amadeus Fare Families and
Amadeus Ancillary Services, providing travel agency customers with access to the airline’s complete range
of merchandising content via XML. This will enable full access to the airline’s products with the efficiency
and transparency offered by the Global Distribution System (GDS). Additionally Amadeus will also work
together with Air Canada to leverage existing features of the Amadeus Selling Platform.

Additionally Etihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, announced it will become the
first Middle Eastern carrier to implement Amadeus Fare Families in the indirect channel.

Meanwhile both Lufthansa and Austrian implemented Amadeus Fare Families. They joined other Lufthansa
Group airlines Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) and Brussels Airlines as the first airlines to go live with
ATPCo Branded Fares - a technology which Amadeus is the first provider to support. Amadeus subscribers
can book Lufthansa and Austrian’s new branded fares, Light, Classic and Flex, across the direct and indirect
channels through all Amadeus retailing interfaces, across worldwide points of sale, and for all customer
segments to provide a consistent offer to both intermediaries and travellers.

Travel agencies are playing a greater role in the sale of ancillaries as the number of online travel agencies
(OTAs) with airline ancillaries integrated into their systems tripled year-on-year during 2015. During the full
year of 2015 Amadeus saw an almost 100% increase in travel agency sales of ancillaries. For certain
carriers, up to 40% of their bookings distributed by OTAs included an ancillary sale.

Travellers are much closer to a door-to-door experience as Amadeus Selling Platform’s latest module now
enables travel agents to sell airport express tickets as they book a flight or hotel. London’s Heathrow
Express became the first to launch this Amadeus tool and it will be followed by Airtrain in Brisbane during
2016.

Deutsche Bahn (DB), one of the leading transportation and logistics companies worldwide that carried 4.3
billion passengers in 2014, renewed its existing agreement with Amadeus for another three years. With this
new agreement online travel agencies (OTAs) worldwide were able to access DB’s full range of routes and
fares via Amadeus Rail Web Services, whilst corporate and traditional travel agencies continued to do so via

(Millions of euros) aMa DEUS

Amadeus Rail Display and Amadeus eTravel Management. Amadeus’ rail platform provides OTAs with a one-
stop-shop to market leading rail content with over ten providers including DB.

Travel Intelligence:

Our Travel Intelligence business launched the Amadeus Agency Insight suite during the summer, for which
customers already included leading players such as Costamar, Makemytrip, Despegar, Tije, Asiana Global
Travel Service, Delfos, Travelfast and Nuevo Mundo. The Travel Intelligence suite helps travel agents to
leverage Big Data technologies by transforming market and traveller data into unique and actionable
insights. This data enables strategic decision-making in areas such as assessing profitable routes and
markets to promote travellers’ search behaviour and compare performance against competitors. At the core
of this offer is the Amadeus Travel Intelligence Engine, a cloud-based and scalable platform designed to
deliver total flexibility and speed with no data limit.

Later in the year Travel Intelligence’s latest solution - Amadeus Schedule Recovery - was launched with
Australia’s largest carrier, Qantas Airways. Using data analytics to make rapid choices, such as whether to
delay / cancel flights or reassign landing slots, the tool minimises disruptions caused by external events
such as bad weather or air traffic control congestion. The tool is divided into three modules: Airport
Resource Tracker, Schedule Manager and Schedule Optimiser.

IT Solutions
Airline IT:

After the close of the 2015 year, on January 26, 2016 Amadeus announced that, following regulatory
approval, it had closed the deal to acquire Navitaire, a provider of technology and business solutions to the
airline industry, from Accenture for €766.5 million. The addition of Navitaire’s portfolio of products and
solutions for the low-cost and hybrid segments complements Amadeus’ Altéa Suite of offerings for its
largely full-service carrier customer base, giving the company the ability to serve a wider group of airlines.
Amadeus will market and sell the two product portfolios separately and will continue to invest in both
platforms, enhancing the services and functionality availability to all types of carriers.

As of the close of the year 132 airlines globally were contracted for both Altéa Reservation and Altéa
Inventory, 120 of which were contracted to use the full Altéa Suite (which additionally includes Altéa
Departure Control). By the end of the year 124 airlines had already been implemented for Altéa Reservation
and Altéa Inventory, 105 of which were already using the full Altéa Suite. The Altéa Suite facilitates closer
integration between partner airlines that need to share availability, fares, customer and booking
information, thus enabling the same customer experience across alliance members.

The latest addition to the Altéa platform is Brussels Airlines, which contracted for the full Altéa Suite in
2015. The airline represents approximately 7.5 million passengers on a yearly basis and already
implemented Altéa Reservation and Altéa Inventory in January 2016 (in parallel with Swiss International Air
Lines).

Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) migrated to Amadeus Altéa Revenue Management Suite, laying the foundation
for the most accurate and intelligent pricing of airline packages and offers. This followed a strategic
partnership established in 2013 that saw SAS’ highly experienced revenue management experts join
Amadeus to create a groundbreaking ‘Centre of Competence’. The Amadeus Altéa Revenue Management
Suite is specifically designed to counter the ‘buy-down effect’ generated by traditional revenue management
practices, whereby systems cannot adequately understand travellers that buy low price flight tickets.
Lufthansa became the first airline to select Altéa Corporate Recognition, which allows airlines to identify
corporate bookings at the moment of reservation. By providing tailor-made offers across all stages of the
journey and enhancing both total spend and improved travel experience, airlines can actively focus on the

Page 8

Consolidated Annual Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2015
(Millions of euros) aMa DEUS

needs of corporates and offer services such as additional baggage and preferential seat options. This service
is complemented by Amadeus’ existing loyalty and personalisation solutions, Loyalty Management Suite and
Altéa Awards Suite.

In response to the challenge faced by airlines of ever increasing flight search volumes - airline ‘look-to-
book’ ratios can now easily run to 1,000:1 - Amadeus launched Airline Cloud Availability, a cloud-based
dynamic availability solution that also applies dynamic revenue management strategies. This followed a
successful pilot with Lufthansa and Google Cloud Platform. By synchronising the airline’s central systems
and the distributed instances of the airline’s availability calculation in real-time, consumers can search and
shop for Lufthansa’s offers more efficiently and receive results of the airline’s availability that are close to
100% accurate, regardless of the technological set up of the travel seller. At the same time, the airline does
not lose out on any sale opportunity by being able to respond accurately to these exponentially growing
shopping requests, whilst protecting the airline’s own central systems.

New Businesses
Hotel IT:

In the Hotel IT sector, InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG) and Amadeus announced a partnership to
develop a next-generation Guest Reservation System (GRS) that will revolutionise the technological
foundations of the global hospitality industry. Working on a new cloud-based ‘Community Model’ similar to
the model Amadeus developed for the global airline industry, the system will be a first in the hotel sector.
Amadeus expanded its technology offering to the hotel industry with the acquisition of Netherlands-based
Itesso BV, a provider of cloud-native property management systems (PMS). With its new cloud-native
Itesso Enterprise Lodging System (Itesso ELS), the company is leading the industry towards a new
generation of property management solutions and also currently provides PMS technology to 1,800
properties worldwide. Characterised by an award-winning customer service and an ‘easy-to-do-business-
with’ mentality, Itesso is a strong addition to the Hotel IT portfolio.

In addition, the Amadeus sales and catering offering to the hotel industry was increased with the acquisition
of Hotel SystemsPro by Newmarket, an Amadeus company. This acquisition brings a complementary
product set targeted at mid-tier hotels. Hotel SystemsPro is a US-based provider of sales, catering and
maintenance software to the hotel and hospitality industry and delivers high-performance, Application
Server Provider (ASP)-based enterprise and property solutions to more than 4,500 hotels in North America
and beyond.

Together, these two deals brought Amadeus closer to its vision of uniting systems known today as Central
Reservation Systems (CRS), Property Management Systems (PMS), Revenue Management Systems (RMS),
Sales & Catering and others, into a cloud-based platform which is fully centered around the guest
experience.

Airport IT:

In the largest airport IT market globally, North America, Amadeus accelerated its expansion through the
acquisition of Florida-based Air-Transport IT Services Inc. (Air IT). Currently 30 of the top 50 busiest
airports in the US use AirIT ’s solutions, along with a strong customer base of more than 70 airport
operators in the US, Canada, and the Caribbean. Outside of North America, Amadeus will be able to
complement its existing offering with the AirIT PROPworks® portfolio, which is already used by 4 of the 5
busiest airports in the United States.

Perth Airport, the fourth busiest airport in Australia by passenger traffic with over 14 million passengers
annually, is forecast to cut passenger processing costs by 26% and help reduce carbon dioxide emissions
through the implementation of the Amadeus Airport Common Use Service (ACUS) platform - a next-

generation common use solution which enables passenger processing systems to be accessed and deployed
anywhere on demand.

Amadeus contributed to Munich Airport reducing runway waiting time by 50% and inbound delays by 24%,
whilst improving flight slot adherence by 22%, through the adoption of Amadeus Airport Sequence
Manager. The solution improves flight departure sequencing and runway capacity to reduces environmental
impact, bringing benefits to the whole airport ecosystem.

Payments:

Elavon, a leading global payments provider that works with more than 50 of the world’s leading airlines and
the top global acquirer for the global travel industry, will integrate its payment processing solutions into the
Amadeus Payments Platform (APP), which is used by more than 300 airlines and ensures a fast and easy
authorisation process integrated into ticketing and selling.

During the first quarter of 2016 Amadeus launched B2B Wallet Prepaid, a virtual card payment solution
which allows travel agencies to improve cash flow management when paying for travel content. The solution
consists of two virtual cards linked to the same account, one for earning a rebate on the amount spent, and
one to help avoid payment card surcharges applied by some travel providers. B2B Wallet Prepaid
complements Amadeus’ existing virtual credit card offer.

Other news from the year:

For the fourth consecutive year Amadeus was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), listed
within the IT & Internet Software and Services sector. The DJSI are composed of global sustainability
leaders who are identified based on economic, environmental, and social criteria. Considered amongst the
most renowned standards available to investors for evaluating sustainability and environmental
performance, only those companies among the top 10% of scorers enter the DJSI.

The European Commission (EC) ranked Amadeus as number one in the European travel and tourism
category in its 2015 annual R&D investment Scorecard (which is based on the 2014 financial year). During
2014 Amadeus invested €568.4 million in R&D, taking the total invested between 2004 and the end of 2014
to over €3.5 billion. We invested an additional €660.7 million in 2015. The scoreboard, which examines R&D
investment by both European and worldwide companies, ranks companies based on total investment.
Amadeus joined forces with the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) to advance the use of innovative
technology in tourism in areas such as education and multi-modality. Amadeus has been a UNWTO Affiliate
Member since 2007 and now signed a Memorandum of Understanding to consolidate the partnership in
several areas. This included the development of a UNWTO Prototype on multi-modality - the door-to-door
planning and ticketing of trips involving all possible transport options — to further integrate different means
of transport between destinations around the world.

Iberia and Amadeus renewed an alliance to support UNICEF in a bid to fight against deadly diseases. Via a
platform developed by Amadeus, travellers purchasing tickets from the Iberia website can make donations.
This forms part of the Amadeus Technology for Good program, which involves the use of our technology to
drive sustainable, social development initiatives. Working in partnership with UNICEF and Iberia, plus other
airlines such as Finnair and Norwegian, over USD 1 million has now been donated.

In April Future Traveller Tribes 2030: understanding tomorrow's traveller- a report commissioned by
Amadeus and written by global consumer trends consultancy The Future Foundation —- identified the six
different traveller personalities and segments the industry can expect to emerge and become prominent
over the next 15 years. This was used as the basis for a follow-up paper, launched in June, called Future
Traveller Tribes 2030: Building a more rewarding journey - commissioned by Amadeus and written by Frost
& Sullivan - offering practical advice for airlines and other travel providers seeking to develop strategies to
create a more rewarding journey for emerging traveller segments.

A purchase price allocation exercise in relation to the consolidation of Pyton into Amadeus’ books will be carried
out in the coming quarters.

3.3 Navitaire

On July 1, 2015, Amadeus announced its agreement to acquire Navitaire, a U.S-based provider of technology
and business solutions to the airline industry, from Accenture. Amadeus received all the necessary regulatory
approvals and the closing took place on January 26, 2016. The cash consideration transferred in relation to this
acquisition amounted to €766.5 million. The acquisition was 100% debt-financed, partially through the drawing
of the €500 million bank loan facility executed on July 3, 2015 (structured as a “club deal” financing entered
into with twelve banks, with maturity dates in 2019 and 2020), and partially through the €500 million debt
securities issued under our Euro Medium Term Note Programme in November 2015 (with maturity in 2021).
The results of Navitaire will be consolidated into Amadeus’ books from January 26, 2016.

The extraordinary costs of €6.7 million associated with the acquisition, incurred in the second half of 2015,
were reported as indirect costs as of year-end 2015.

4 Main financial risks and hedging policy
4.1 Foreign exchange rate risk

Our reporting currency is the Euro. However, as a result of Amadeus’ global activity and presence, part of our
results are generated in currencies different from the Euro and therefore are impacted by foreign exchange
fluctuations. Similarly, part of our cash inflows and outflows are denominated in non-Euro currencies.

Our revenue is mostly generated either in Euro or in US Dollar (the latter representing 25%-30% of our total
revenue). Revenue generated in currencies other than Euro or US Dollar is negligible.

In turn, 35%-45% of our operating costs* are denominated in many currencies different from the Euro,
including the USD which represents 20%-25% of our operating costs. The rest of the foreign currency operating
expenses are denominated in a variety of currencies, GBP, AUD, SEK, THB and INR being the most significant.
A number of the currencies in this basket (e.g. HKD, INR and THB) tend to fluctuate vs. the Euro similarly to
the US Dollar - Euro fluctuations, although the degree of this correlation may vary with time.

Amadeus’ target is to reduce the volatility of the non-Euro denominated net cash flows due to foreign exchange
fluctuations. Our hedge strategy is as follows:

(i) The strategy for our exposure to the US Dollar is based on the use of a natural hedge of our net oper-
ating cash flow generated in this currency with the payments of our USD-denominated debt and taxes.
We enter into derivative arrangements when the natural hedge is not sufficient to cover the outstand-
ing exposure.

(ii) We also hedge a number of currencies, including the GBP, AUD and SEK, for which we enter into for-
eign exchange derivatives with banks.

When the hedges in place qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS, profit and losses are recognised within the
revenue caption (under the non-booking revenue line of Distribution). Our hedging arrangements typically
qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS.

4.2 Interest rate risk

Our target is to reduce the volatility of the net interest flows payable. In order to achieve this objective,
Amadeus may enter into interest rate hedging agreements (interest rate swaps, caps, collars) to cover the
floating rate debt.

At December 31, 2015, 8.5%° of our total covenant financial debt was subject to floating interest rates,
indexed to the EURIBOR. As of this date no interest rate hedges were in place.

4 Including Cost of revenue, Personnel expenses and Other operating expenses. Excludes Depreciation and amortisation.

5 This percentage includes the short term financing that we obtain under our European Commercial Paper (ECP) Programme. The interest rate
of this commercial paper is fixed, however, given that it has to be refinanced very frequently, we deem that this type of financing is subject to
interest rate risk and therefore for risk management purposes we include it under the floating rate debt category.

4.3. Own shares price evolution risk
Amadeus has three different staff remuneration schemes which are settled with Amadeus’ shares.

According to the rules of these plans, when they mature their beneficiaries will receive a number of Amadeus
shares which for the outstanding plans will be (depending on the evolution of certain performance conditions)
between a maximum of 2,210,000 shares and a minimum of 270,000 shares, approximately. It is Amadeus’
intention to make use of its treasury shares to settle these plans at their maturity.

1. Net indirect costs include extraordinary costs associated with the acquisition of Navitaire incurred in 2015 (€6.7 million) and with the
acquisition of i:FAO in 2014 (€1.6 million).
Over the fourth quarter of 2015, we experienced a 13.8% revenue increase, confirming the solid growth trend
seen during the first nine months of the year, which led to an increase of €495.0 million or 14.5% in revenue in
2015. Though benefiting from foreign exchange effects and the consolidation of our acquisitions, this growth
was primarily the result of solid performances in both our businesses:

Distribution, supported by a 1.7 p.p. enhancement of our competitive position and the positive evolution of
both booking and non booking revenue, reached total revenue growth of 11.5%.

IT Solutions, driven by a 7.5% growth in passengers boarded, a 9.2% expansion in the IT transactional
revenue per PB, as well as a 49.3% increase in non transactional revenue, contributed with total revenue
growth of 22.1%.

The 12.2% increase in EBITDA in 2015 was driven by growth in contribution from both Distribution (8.8%) and
IT Solutions (16.9%), partially offset by an increase in net indirect costs (10.6%).

EBITDA margin represented 37.5% of revenue in 2015, negatively impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations
and extraordinary cost items, such as acquisition costs linked to our M&A activity® and certain provisions to
cover potential collection risks in countries in difficulties and local tax payments. Excluding these effects, our
2015 EBITDA margin was slightly expansive with respect to 2014, supported by the increasing weight of our IT

The core offering of our Distribution business is our reservations platform. It provides a global network that
connects travel providers, such as full service and low-cost airlines, hotels, rail operators, cruise and ferry
operators, car rental companies, tour operators and insurance companies, with online and offline travel
agencies, facilitating the distribution of travel products and services (sometimes referred to as the “indirect
channel”). We also offer technology solutions, such as desktop and e-commerce platforms and mid- and back-
office systems to some of our travel agency customers and corporations. We have additionally expanded our
product portfolio with Travel Intelligence solutions developed on the latest technologies to optimise the use of
travel data.

Our Distribution business posted solid growth during 2015, driven by higher bookings fuelled by a significant
improvement in our competitive position and an increase in the average fee per booking, as well as growth in
non-booking revenue. This positive performance was supported by foreign exchange impacts and the
consolidation of i:FAO and Pyton.

As a result, our Distribution revenue grew by 11.5% to €2,737.8 million in 2015. Contribution increased by
8.8% to reach €1,177.0 million in the period. As a percentage of revenue, this represented 43.0%, impacted
negatively by foreign exchange effects and certain extraordinary provisions to cover potential collection risks in
countries in difficulties and local tax payments.

© EBITDA was impacted by extraordinary costs associated with the acquisition of Navitaire incurred in 2015 (€6.7 million) and with the
acquisition of i:FAO in 2014 (€1.6 million).

5.1.1 Evolution of operating KPI

During 2015, Amadeus air bookings grew by 8.3% and our competitive position’ improved by 1.7 p.p.,
supported by customer wins in North America and the migration of Topas in South Korea to our platform in
September 2014. The air TA booking industry’, in turn, increased by 3.9% in 2015.

Air bookings grew by 4.6% in the fourth quarter, while the air TA booking industry increased by 1.8%, both
slowing down vs. the first nine months of the year , impacted by an overall deceleration. In addition, volumes
in the fourth quarter did not benefit from the full-year impact of the migration of Topas, which ended in the
third quarter of 2015.

Air TA booking industry

Air TA bookings increased by 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015, reaching 3.9% for the full year period. The
industry decelerated in all regions except for Middle East and Africa, when compared to the first nine months of
the year. In particular, Western Europe showed a remarkable slowdown, with countries such as Germany,
France and Spain reporting negative declines. Central, Eastern and Southern Europe and Latin American
markets posted negative growth. In turn, Asia and Pacific, which no longer benefitted from the extraordinary
impact of the migration of travel agencies from Topas in South Korea to Amadeus, which ended in September
2015, also posted lower growth rates than in the first nine months of the year.

For the full year period, all regions performed positively, except for Latin America (mainly driven by the
economic difficulties in Brazil and Venezuela). Middle East and Africa started reporting positive growth in the
second half of the year, recovering from geopolitical issues and closed the year with an increase in volumes vs.
previous year, though still very weak. The European region also posted limited growth overall, impacted by the
macro-economic context, political issues and terrorism. In turn, North America had a solid performance during
the year. Finally, Asia and Pacific was the fastest growing region, supported by the migration of travel agencies
from Topas to Amadeus initiated late 2014.

Amadeus bookings

Amadeus air travel agency bookings increased by 4.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015, driving full year growth
to 8.3%, supported by industry growth and a strong 1.7 p.p. enhancement of our competitive position.

7 The air TA booking industry is defined as the total volume of travel agency air bookings processed by the global or regional CRS. It excludes
air bookings made directly through in-house airline systems or single country operators, the latter primarily in China, Japan and Russia. Since
the end of the third quarter of 2014, it includes the bookings processed by the travel agencies connected to the Amadeus platform, which
were previously connected to the local CRS Topas in South Korea. Our competitive position is calculated as our air TA bookings over the air TA
booking industry, as defined in this note.

North America and Asia and Pacific were our best performing regions in 2015, benefitting from underlying
growth, customer wins in the United States and the migration of Topas in South Korea to our platform, driving
air bookings growth to 35.6% and 18.6%, respectively in each region. As a result, our exposure to these
regions increased significantly. Our air bookings in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe and Latin America
were negatively impacted by the industry decline in the second half of 2015. Finally, the industry weakness in
Western Europe (and in particular the volume declines of certain countries where Amadeus has a significant
presence such as Germany, France or Spain) and Middle East and Africa led to a limited bookings growth in
2015 in these regions.

Revenue in the Distribution business increased by 9.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015, leading to a 11.5% full
year growth. This increase was driven by both booking and non booking revenue.

Booking revenue contributed to this positive performance with a 12.5% growth in 2015, driven by a 7.7%
increase in total bookings combined with a 4.5% growth in the average fee per booking. This positive pricing
impact was supported by the appreciation of the USD vs. the Euro and certain customer renegotiations
resulting in a higher booking fee, offsetting the underlying dilutive effect from our significant growth in North
America and South Korea (where the weight of local bookings is higher).

Non booking revenue grew by 5.1% during the year, mostly supported by (i) search solutions provided to
metasearch engines, (ii) enhanced functionalities for travel agencies, travel management companies and
corporations, (iii) data and advertising solutions, as well as (iv) the contribution of our acquisitions i:FAO and
Pyton. This positive performance was partly diminished by a negative hedging impact.

5.1.3. Contribution

The contribution of our Distribution business is calculated after deducting from our revenue those operating
costs which can be directly allocated to the business (variable costs, mainly related to distribution fees and
incentives, and product development, marketing and commercial costs).

The contribution of our Distribution business grew by 8.8%, leading to a total contribution of €1,177.0 million in
2015. This positive performance was the result of 11.5% revenue growth, offset by an increase of 13.7% in net
operating costs (as a combination of gross operating costs increasing by 13.5% and capitalisations by 8.6%).

Gross operating costs were negatively impacted by foreign exchange effects (with a particular high impact on
incentives), and certain provisions to cover potential collection risks in countries in difficulties and local tax
payments. The underlying increase was driven by:

Growth in incentives and distribution fees, driven by higher volumes (+8.3% increase in air bookings in the
period) and an overall contained unit distribution cost increase.
Moderate growth in fixed costs, slightly ahead of inflation, driven by:

e An increase in R&D expenditure dedicated to new products and solutions for travel agencies,
corporations and airlines, including sophisticated booking and search engines, enhanced
merchandising and customisation capabilities, as well as XML-connectivity efforts, most of which are
subject to capitalisation.

e A limited increase in our core commercial costs, impacted by the annual salary and variable
remuneration reviews.

e The expansion of our activities, including the consolidation of i:FAO, increased resources dedicated to
Travel Intelligence, as well as higher costs related to services (consulting, training).

processes for travel providers, as well as providing direct distribution technologies. We continue our
diversification efforts, expanding our initial Airline IT portfolio with our new initiatives focused on Hotel IT, Rail
IT, Airport IT and Payments.

Our IT Solutions business continued delivering significant growth during 2015, with revenue growing by 22.1%
in the full year period. This increase was supported by IT transactional revenue, driven by growth in our
Passengers Boarded (+7.5%) and a higher average unit fee, as well as Direct Distribution and Non
transactional revenue. The consolidation of our recent acquisitions and foreign exchange effects also impacted
revenue growth positively.

Contribution amounted to €760.8 million in 2015, growing by 16.9% vs. 2014. As a percentage of revenue, this
represented 64.8%, a decrease relative to prior year, impacted negatively by (i) foreign exchange fluctuations
and (ii) a mix effect driven by the growing weight of our new businesses, the consolidation of our acquisitions
and the expansion of our services activities, with lower margins.

5.2.1 Evolution of operating KPI

Total number of passengers boarded increased by 5.3% to 185.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 vs. the
same period of 2014, driven by organic growth as well as recent implementations, such as All Nippon Airways
(the international passengers business) migrated in the second quarter of 2015 and the Thomas Cook Group
Airlines, which finalized implementation in the fourth quarter of 2015. The full year impact of 2014 migrations
was more limited in the fourth quarter as the larger one, Korean Air, migrated at the end of the third quarter of
2014.

During the full year 2015, the volume of passengers boarded reached 747.3 million, 7.5% higher than in 2014,
fuelled by the above mentioned 2014-15 Altéa migrations and a 2.2% organic growth.

During 2015, the weighting of Asia and Pacific over our total PBs increased significantly (+3.0 p.p. vs. 2014),
supported by the contribution of new airlines migrating to the Altéa platform (mainly Korean Air and All Nippon
Airways - the international passengers business). The 2014 implementations of Southwest (the international
passengers business), Seaport and Cape Air have also led to an increasing (+0.4 p.p. vs. 2014)-though still
limited- weighting of North America. Both regions will continue raising their weighting in the coming years with
the migration of Japan Airlines and Southwest (the domestic passengers business). Latin America performed
positively in the year in spite of the economic deterioration in Brazil which impacted negatively, particularly in
the fourth quarter of 2015. In turn, political instability remained a concern for many regional carriers in Middle
East and Africa throughout 2015. Finally, the macro-economic situation, strikes and terrorist attacks affected
the PB performance of our European client base.

Transactional Revenue

IT Transactional Revenue

Under this category, we include revenues derived from (i) our Altéa offering for airlines, which provides
inventory and departure control capabilities, in addition to integrated reservation solutions, delivered in a
modular format on a community-based platform, (ii) our e-commerce solutions, which provide online shopping
and booking engines for airline websites, along with related functionalities, (iii) our range of standalone IT
solutions, which are complementary to, and fully compatible with, our Altéa solutions (such as Amadeus
Revenue Integrity or Amadeus Ticket Changer), and (iv) other revenue from our Airport IT, Payment, or Rail IT
solutions.

IT Transactional revenue reached €809.6 million for the full year period, growing by 17.4% vs. 2014. This
increase was supported by volume growth and an increase of 9.2% in the IT transactional revenue per PB.
Excluding foreign exchange considerations, all main revenue lines reported strong growth:

Altéa: driven by an increase of 7.5% in Passengers Boarded, as well as a higher average price from
upselling activity which resulted in the implementations of new modules and solutions (such as Altéa
Departure Control System, Altéa Revenue Management Suite).

E-commerce: strong performance as a result of organic growth and new implementations, as well as a
positive contribution from upselling activities.

Standalone IT solutions: positive evolution driven by multiple products such as Amadeus Ticket Changer,
revenue availability, self-services solutions, and ancillary services.

New businesses: positive performance of Airport IT (including the consolidation of our acquisitions UFIS and
Air IT) and Payments, though still both relatively small.

Direct Distribution

Direct distribution revenue includes (i) fees charged for bookings made through the direct sales channel of an
airline using our Altéa Reservation solution and for certain types of air bookings made through the direct sales
channel of Altéa customers for which we charge a booking fee, not a PB fee, and (ii) fees charged to airlines
using our Altéa Reservation solution for complementary functionalities that are closely related to the booking
process.

Revenue from Direct Distribution increased by 9.2% in 2015 vs. 2014, mainly driven by organic volume growth.

Non Transactional Revenue

Non-transactional revenue refers to (i) the customization and implementation fees of our Altéa PSS solutions,
(ii) the provision of bespoke services, application hosting and other customer support services to airlines, and
(iii) our Hotel IT solutions.

Non transactional revenue increased by €82.9 million, or 49.3% in 2015 vs. 2014. Excluding foreign exchange
impacts, this growth was a result of:

Growth in our Hotel IT business, from its Sales & Catering area (through our acquisitions, Newmarket in
2014 and Hotel SystemsPro in 2015) and to a lesser extent from PMS, via Itesso acquired in 2015. (See
section 3 for further detail on these acquisitions.)

Growth in revenue from Services (for example, bespoke services related to e-commerce).

An increase in revenue from implementation fees, mostly driven by deferred revenues which start to be
recognised after the customer implementation takes place.

5.2.3 Contribution

The contribution of our IT Solutions business is calculated after deducting from our revenue those operating
costs which can be directly allocated to this business (variable costs, including certain distribution fees, and
product development, marketing and commercial costs).

The contribution of the IT Solutions business increased by 16.9%, amounting to €760.8 million in 2015. This
increase was the result of a 22.1% revenue growth, partially offset by an increase of 32.9% in net operating
costs (which in turn was a combination of gross operating costs growing at 28.2% and capitalisations at
19.5%).

Growth in gross operating costs was negatively impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations. The underlying
increase was mainly due to:

An increase in our R&D expenditure devoted to (i) customer implementations, (ii) Airline IT portfolio
evolution and expansion (including improved merchandising functionalities, cloud and optimized
availability), and (iii) our new initiatives (mainly related to the development of our next-generation Guest
Reservation System under our agreement with IHG in Hotel IT).

Higher commercial support driven by our portfolio diversification and customer base expansion.

The increasing weight of our new initiatives, most of which are in development mode or still at an early
stage and may generate costs at a faster pace than revenues. As some products enter into
commercialization phase, the capitalisation ratio will tend to slow down while the commercial efforts
increase in order for the revenue ramp-up to materialize. In addition, these new initiatives do not have the
operational leverage of our more mature Airline IT business.

Increased resources dedicated to Services, a lower margin activity, as we expand progressively in this area.
The consolidation of our 2014-2015 acquisitions with lower margins.

5.3 EBITDA

In 2015, EBITDA increased by 12.2%, to €1,465.4 million, driven by the positive underlying performance of
both our Distribution and IT Solutions businesses. The consolidation of our 2014-2015 acquisitions as well as a
positive foreign exchange impact also contributed to this growth.

The Distribution and IT Solutions contributions were partially offset by an increase of 10.6% in net indirect
costs, which was the result of gross indirect costs increasing by 17.1% and capitalisations by 44.2%. The
increase in gross operating costs was mainly attributable to:

An emphasized focus on cross area development and data centre related projects, as we are heavily
investing in technological and organisational transformation to improve agility and maximise our system
reliability, availability, and overall performance. Additionally, the shift to open systems which brings
scalability and increased efficiency continued during 2015. Most of these projects are capitalised, explaining
the increase in indirect capitalisation.

Higher resources to ensure the right level of corporate support following our business expansion (e.g. new
initiatives) and widened geographical reach (e.g. North America, Asia Pacific).

An increase in costs related to security matters (our Security Office ensures our own and our customers’
information assets are well protected and that mitigations are adequately implemented. The scope covers
operations, applications, services and products as well as our internal IT systems).

Legal and consultancy costs driven by our M&A activity, including integration costs related to our
acquisitions.

A reduction in R&D subsidies compared with 2014.

6.1.1 Revenue

Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 reached €947.9 million, increasing by 13.8% vs. the fourth quarter of
2014. For the full year 2015, revenue increased 14.5%, to €3,912.7 million. Revenue growth was driven by
solid performances throughout the year in our Distribution and IT Solutions businesses, and also benefitted
from a positive foreign exchange impact and the consolidation of our acquisitions. Overall, the increase was a
combination of:

Growth of 9.5% in our Distribution business in the fourth quarter of 2015, leading to a 11.5% increase for
the full year period.

An increase of 24.5%, in our IT Solutions business in the fourth quarter of 2015. IT Solutions revenue
increased by 22.1% in the full year period.
(See section 5.1.2 and 5.2.2 for more detail on revenue growth within Distribution and IT Solutions)

Revenue 947.9 832.7 13.8% 3,912.7 3,417.7 14.5%

6.1.2 Cost of revenue

These costs are mainly related to: (i) incentive fees per booking paid to travel agencies, (ii) distribution fees
per booking paid to those local commercial organisations which are not majority owned by Amadeus, (iii)
distribution fees paid to Amadeus Altéa customers for certain types of air bookings made through their direct
sales channel, and (iv) data communication expenses relating to the maintenance of our computer network,
including connection charges.

Cost of revenue amounted to €253.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 18.0% vs. the same
period of 2014, leading to a 18.7% increase in the full year period, highly negatively impacted by foreign
exchange effects. The underlying growth was mainly a result of higher air TA bookings (+8.3% in 2015), and a
contained unit distribution cost increase.

6.1.3. Personnel and related expenses and other operating expenses

A large proportion of Amadeus’ employees are software developers. Amadeus also hires contractors to support
its development activity, complementing the permanent staff. The overall ratio of permanent staff vs.
contractors devoted to R&D fluctuates depending on business needs and project mix, therefore impacting the
evolution of both “Personnel expenses” and “Other operating expenses” captions in our income statement.

Our combined operating expenses cost line, including both Personnel expenses and Other operating expenses,
amounted to €1,393.0 million in 2015, representing a 13.7% growth vs. 2014. The 7.0% increase in the fourth
quarter of 2015 benefitted from a higher capitalisation ratio compared with the first nine months of the year.

The below factors contributed to our combined operating expenses cost growth in 2015:

An increase of 8% in average FTEs (permanent staff and contractors), impacted by the integration of our
2014 and 2015 acquisitions, combined with the salary and variable remuneration reviews undertaken yearly
on a global basis.

Computing expenses from our data centre in Erding, dedicated to adapting our systems to next generation
open-sourced technological capabilities and adopting a new Ultra High Availability architecture to ensure
extremely quick responses and optimal availability, in a context of ever-growing transaction levels
processed on a daily basis. (As an example, airline ‘look-to-book’ ratios - the average number of search
requests before a flight booking is actually made - were previously as low as 10:1. Today, these can easily
run to 1,000:1.)

Increase in consultancy and integration costs driven by our M&A activity and internal security projects.
These effects were partly offset by a higher capitalisation ratio driven by project mix.

Our cost base was also impacted by a negative foreign exchange impact, as well as certain extraordinary
impacts including (i) acquisition costs related to our M&A activity, most importantly Navitaire®, as well as (ii)
certain provisions to cover potential collection risks in countries in difficulties and local tax payments. Excluding
these impacts, our personnel and other operating expenses increased broadly in line with our FTEs.

The growth in average FTEs was mainly driven by:

Higher headcount in R&D, dedicated to customer implementations, ongoing portfolio expansion and product
evolution (including the new initiatives), system performance projects and services (see further detail in
sections 2.2 and 6.3.2).

Reinforcement of our commercial, technical and corporate support, as a result of our expanding customer
base, geographical reach (such as Asia and Pacific and North America) and product portfolio (including the
new initiatives).

The consolidation of our 2014-15 acquisitions.

6.1.4 Depreciation and Amortisation

Depreciation and amortisation post-capitalisations increased by 17.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015 vs. the
same period of 2014, driving full year growth to 17.7%, mainly driven by higher ordinary depreciation and
amortisation as well as higher amortisation derived from PPA.

Ordinary depreciation and amortisation increased by 14.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015, leading to a 19.8%
growth for the full year period, driven by:

Increase in amortisation of intangible assets, as a result of the amortisation of capitalised development
expenses on our balance sheet, as the associated product / contract started generating revenues (for
example, previously capitalised costs related to the migration of customers which have been recently
implemented, or certain product development projects).

Higher depreciation expense related to (i) new hardware and software acquired for our data processing
centre in Erding (Germany), (ii) finance lease agreements for office buildings in Nice (France) signed in
March 2014 and Bad Homburg (Germany) in April 2015 as well as their associated new equipment.

The consolidation of our 2014-2015 acquisitions.

Following the PPA exercises in relation to the consolidation of our latest acquisitions, the amortisation derived
from PPA increased by 16.5% in 2015. The decrease in the fourth quarter was driven by a seasonality impact
as the PPA exercise related to Newmarket and UFIS was done in the fourth quarter of 2014 retroactively since
the date of consolidation (see further explanation on the PPA exercises in section 3).

° Other operating expenses include extraordinary costs associated with the acquisition of Navitaire incurred in 2015 (€6.7 million) and with the
acquisition of i:FAO in 2014 (€1.6 million).

In compliance with IFRS, impairment tests are carried out every year (and, in the absence of any impairment
indicator, we generally concentrate them in the second half of the year). During 2014 and 2015 we reported
certain impairment losses in relation to products that we estimated would not deliver the expected economic
benefits, due to either unforeseen efforts required to deliver the customer's needs, or a reassessment
downwards of the expected demand.

6.1.5 EBITDA and Operating income

EBITDA grew 19.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015, driving full year growth to 12.2%, driven by the positive
underlying performances of our Distribution and IT Solutions businesses. The consolidation of our latest
acquisitions and a positive foreign exchange impact also contributed to this growth (see section 4.1 for details
on the exposure of our operating results to foreign exchange fluctuations).

EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of 2015 represented 33.9% of revenues, expanding 1.6 p.p. vs. the same
quarter in 2014, supported by a higher capitalisation ratio in the fourth quarter. For the full year period,
EBITDA margin reached 37.5% of revenues, negatively impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations and
extraordinary cost items (such as acquisition costs linked to our M&A activity? and certain provisions to cover
potential collection risks in countries in difficulties and local tax payments). Excluding these effects, our 2015
EBITDA margin was slightly expansive with respect to 2014, supported by the increasing weight of our IT
Solutions business, with higher margins.

Operating Income increased by 20.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015 and reached a 10.2% growth for the full
year 2015, driving our Operating Income to €1,053.0 million. The increase is a result of EBITDA growth offset
by higher D&A charges.

10 EBITDA was impacted by extraordinary costs associated with the acquisition of Navitaire incurred in 2015 (€6.7 million) and with the
acquisition of i:FAO in 2014 (€1.6 million).

6.1.6 Net financial expense

Net financial expense declined from €15.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to €7.3 million in the same
quarter of 2015. For the full year, net financial expense decreased by 9.6%, from €56.3 million in 2014 to
€50.9 million in 2015, mainly as a result of (i) a lower interest expense and (ii) higher exchange gains.

Interest expense in 2015 declined by 6.5%, mostly driven by a lower average cost of debt. Due to the
refinancing we undertook in the first quarter of 2015, extending the maturity of the previous revolving credit
facility and expanding its notional amount of €300 million to €1,000 million, we recognised outstanding
deferred financing fees amounting to €1.7 million linked to the previous facility. Excluding this impact, interest
expense in 2015 declined by 8.9% vs. 2014.

Exchange gains were mainly a consequence of the appreciation of the US Dollar vs. the Euro in both 2014 and
2015, impacting our USD-denominated assets and liabilities on our balance sheet which are not linked to the
operating activity of the company.

Income taxes for the full year 2015 amounted to €321.4 million vs. €268.7 million in 2014, representing a
19.6% increase. The income tax rate for the full year 2015 was 32.0%, higher than the 29.9% rate reported in
2014. (Excluding a non-recurring adjustment related to the new Spanish corporate tax rate, 2014 income tax
rate was 32.2% in 2014). The 2015 income tax rate was negatively impacted by the settlement of a tax claim
related to Corporate Income Tax for tax years 2005-2010, partly offset by the new (lower) corporate tax rate in
Spain.

reduction through the amortization of the repurchased shares was approved by the General Shareholders
Meeting on June 25, 2015 and was registered in the Commercial Registry of Madrid on August 4, 2015.

The maximum investment under the share buy-back programme (€320 million) was recognised in the state-

This caption principally includes land and buildings, data processing hardware and software, and other PP&E
assets such as building installations, furniture and fittings and miscellaneous.

PP&E increased by €88.9 million in 2015. This increase was mainly the result of the combination of the following
effects: (i) additions (+€201.8 million), mostly related to data processing hardware and software acquired for
our data processing centre in Erding (Germany), a new finance lease agreement for an office building in Bad
Homburg (Germany) which started in April 2015 and new furniture and equipment for such building, (ii)
additions from the acquisitions (+€1.1 million), and (iii) depreciation charges (-€114.5 million).

6.2.2 Intangible assets

This caption principally includes (i) the net cost of acquisition or development and (ii) the excess purchase price
allocated to patents, trademarks and licenses!, technology and content!? and contractual relationships*?. In
particular, it includes the excess purchase price derived from the business combination between Amadeus IT
Group, S.A. (the former listed company) and Amadeus IT Holding, S.A. (the current listed company, formerly
known as WAM Acquisition, S.A.), following the acquisition of Amadeus IT Group, S.A. by Amadeus IT Holding,
S.A. in 2005.

Intangible assets increased by €259.4 million in 2015. This increase was mainly the result of the combination of
the following effects: (i) additions of software internally developed (+€405.3 million) and acquired assets
(+€49.1 million), (ii) additions from the acquisitions, including the effects derived from the purchase price
allocation exercises carried out as part of the consolidation process of i:FAO, Hotel SystemsPro and Air IT into
Amadeus’ books (+€82.8 million), and (iii) amortisation charges and impairment losses (-€307.5 million).

6.2.3 Goodwill

Goodwill amounted €2,478.9 million as of December 31, 2015. Goodwill mainly relates to the unallocated
amount of the excess purchase price derived from (i) the business combination between Amadeus IT Holding,
S.A. and Amadeus IT Group, S.A. following the acquisition of Amadeus IT Group, S.A. by Amadeus IT Holding,
S.A. in 2005, and (ii) the acquisitions of subsidiaries, most of them completed in 2014 and 2015. In particular,
the acquisitions done in 2015 increased the goodwill by €72.3 million (Hotel Systems Pro, Air IT, Itesso and
Pyton). Goodwill generated in the acquisitions of Itesso and Pyton is subject to changes as a result of the
purchase price allocation exercises that will be carried out in the next quarters.

6.2.4 Equity. Share capital

As of December 31, 2015 the share capital of our Company was represented by 438,822,506 shares with a

acquiring software licenses developed outside the Group for Distribution and IT Solutions.

2 Net cost of acquiring technology software and travel content either by means of acquisitions through business combinations / separate
acquisitions or internally generated (software applications developed by the Group, including the development technology of the IT solutions
business). Travel content is obtained by Amadeus through its relationships with travel providers.

13 Net cost of contractual relationships with travel agencies, as acquired through business combinations, as well as costs subject to
capitalisations, related to travel agency incentives, that can be recognised as an asset.

and paid during the year, and (iii) the finance lease agreement for a new office building in Bad Homburg
(Germany).

As of December 31, 2015, our covenant net financial debt represented 1.09 times covenant net financial debt
to EBITDA.**

The main following changes to our debt structure during 2015 are detailed below.

We fully amortised the Senior Credit Facility: voluntary repayment of €41.3 million from the EUR-
denominated loan facility, and repayment of €183.6 million from the USD-denominated loan facility (adding
voluntary and scheduled repayments). Due to the USD/EUR exchange rate evolution and in accordance with
the conditions agreed in the senior credit agreement, Amadeus also paid €22.4 million in 2015.

We repaid, according to schedule, €12.5 million related to the European Investment Bank loan.

A €56.7 million finance lease agreement for a new office building in Bad Homburg (Germany) started in
April 2015.

We had used the Multi-Currency European Commercial Paper (ECP) programme, set up in December 2014,
by a net amount of €196.4 million as of December 31, 2015.

In November 2015, we issued a six-year bond amounting to €500 million under our Euro Medium Term
Note Programme, with maturity in 2021, in part to finance the Navitaire acquisition.

We also agreed the below facilities during 2015, both unused as of December 31, 2015.

In March 2015, we agreed a new €1,000 million Dual Tranche (each tranche amounting to €500 million)
revolving credit facility, substituting the previous €300 million revolving credit facility which was cancelled
simultaneously. The new revolving facility will be used as (i) a back-stop facility for the refinancing of the
€750 million notes maturing on July 15, 2016, as well as (ii) working capital requirements and general
corporate purposes.

In July 2015, we agreed a new €500 million credit facility for the acquisition of Navitaire. The facility has a
five year term (July 3, 2020) with maturity dates in 2019 and 2020. This facility was fully drawn on January
25, 2016.

1 Our leverage pro-forma for the Navitaire acquisition closed on January 26, 2016, is 1.56x, based on the final cash consideration of €766.5
million and an estimated Navitaire EBITDA of USD 60 million.

its nominal value, while in our financial statements our financial debt is measured at amortised cost, i.e., after
deducting the deferred financing fees (that correspond mainly to fees paid upfront in connection with the set-up
of new credit agreements and amount to €12.5 million at December 31, 2015), and (iii) does not include an
adjustment for the difference between the nominal value of the loan granted by the EIB at below-market
interest rate and its fair value (€7.3 million at December 31, 2015).

1. EBITDA was impacted by extraordinary costs associated with the acquisition of Navitaire incurred in 2015 (€6.7 million) and with the
acquisition of i:FAO in 2014 (€1.6 million). Excluding these costs, EBITDA grew by 12.6%, to €1,472.1 million.
2. Cash and cash equivalents are presented net of overdraft bank accounts.

6.3.1 Change in working capital

Amadeus typically works on negative working capital (i.e. cash inflows), driven by the fact that Amadeus
collects payments from most airlines (more than 80% of our group collections) through IATA and ACH, with an
average collection period of just over one month, whilst payments to providers and suppliers are made on
average over a significantly longer period.

Cash inflow in 2015 was higher than in 2014, mainly due to timing differences in incentive and VAT payments.

6.3.2 Capital expenditure. R&D investment
Capital expenditure

The table below details the capital expenditure in the period, both in property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”)
and intangible assets. Based on the nature of our investments in PP&E, the figures may show variations on a
quarterly basis, depending on the timing of certain investments. The same applies to our investments in
contractual relationships where payments to travel agencies may take place in different periods, based on the
timing of the negotiations. In turn, our capitalised R&D investment may fluctuate depending on the level of
capitalisation ratio, which is impacted by the intensity of the development activity, the mix of projects
undertaken and the different stages in which the ongoing projects are.

Capex in the fourth quarter of 2015 amounted to €156.8 million, increasing 38.1% vs. the same period of
2014, mainly explained by higher capitalised R&D, signing bonuses, and investment in hardware in our data
centre. The ratio of capitalised R&D over total R&D investment increased significantly in the fourth quarter of
2015, driven by project mix as well as a relatively low base of comparison in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Page 36


--- Page 34 ---

Amadeus IT Holding, S.A. and Subsidiaries

Consolidated Annual Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2015
(Millions of euros) aMa DEUS

For the full year period, capex increased 28.7% vs. prior year driven by growth in both capex in PP&E and
intangible assets:

Capex in PP&E increased by €28.5 million or 36.7% in 2015, as a result of (i) hardware purchases for our
data centre in Erding to enhance and optimize system performance and adapt to the growing transaction
levels processed on a daily basis, as well as (ii) purchase of equipment required for our new buildings in
Nice (France) and Bad Homburg (Germany).

Capex in intangible assets increased by €94.1 million or 26.9% in 2015 mainly driven by (i) higher software
capitalisations, due to higher R&D investment and a higher capitalisation ratio impacted by the mix and
stages of the projects undertaken, (ii) higher signing bonuses, and (iii) the consolidation of our latest
acquisitions.

It is important to note that most of our investments do not have any revenue associated at this stage
(particularly for our new diversification initiatives), or are investments for projects that will produce the
revenues during the life of the contracts, on average 10 to 15 years in airline IT and 3 to 5 in Distribution,
therefore affecting the capex as a percentage of revenue ratio in the short term. More importantly, a large part
of our investments related to the migration of our clients is paid by the customer, although not recognised as
revenue but deferred in the balance sheet. It is therefore capex which does not have a negative cash impact
and where revenue does not get recognised as such, making the ratio of capex to revenue less relevant.

R&D investment

As a leading and differentiated technology provider for the travel industry, Amadeus undertakes significant R&D
activities, which are the main driver for growth.

R&D investment (including both capitalised and non-capitalised expenses) increased by 13.4% in the fourth
quarter of 2015 vs. the same period in 2014, and by 17.8% growth in the full year period, impacted by
negative foreign exchange effects as well as by reduced R&D subsidies. As a percentage of revenue, R&D
investment amounted to 16.4% in 2015.

The increase in R&D was mainly driven by:

Higher level of investment related to our ongoing activities: (i) portfolio expansion and product evolution
(such as merchandising and personalization solutions, cloud and optimized availability, XML connectivity),
(ii) customer implementation efforts related to the contracted pipeline in Altéa, standalone and e-commerce
solutions, and (iii) services (for example bespoke services related to e-commerce).

Increased efforts dedicated to our new initiatives, mainly in (i) Hotel IT, with the development of our Guest
Reservation System in coordination with IHG, (ii) Rail IT, with teams dedicated to our partner Bene Rail, (iii)
Travel Intelligence, as well as (iv) additional R&D investment from the consolidation of our 2014-15
acquisitions.

Growing investment in technological projects to optimise system performance (enhancing service levels,
availability, reliability, and security) and shift towards open systems through next-generation technologies
(TPF decommissioning).

It should be noted that a significant part of our research and development costs is linked to activities which are
subject to capitalisation. The intensity of the development activity and the different stages of the ongoing
projects have an effect on the capitalisation ratio in any given quarter, therefore impacting the level of
operating expenses that are capitalised on our balance sheet.

6.3.3 Taxes paid

Taxes paid in the fourth quarter of 2015 amounted to €155.2 million, compared to €134.1 million in the same
period in 2014. For the full year 2015, tax payments amounted to €275.7 million, lower than €290.7 million
paid in 2014. The reduction in taxes paid in 2015 was mostly driven by higher amounts reimbursed by tax
authorities associated with regularisations from previous years in comparison to reimbursements collected in
2014.

6.3.4 Interest and financial fees paid

Interest payments under our debt arrangements amounted to €63.3 million in 2015, slightly higher than €62.6
million paid in 2014. This increase was driven by (i) higher commissions paid in relation to new financing
facilities signed or used in the year (the issuance of bonds under the EMTN programme, the use of the ECP
programme, a new revolving credit facility), partly offset by (ii) lower amounts of debt interest paid as a
consequence of the reduction in the average cost of debt in 2015 vs. 2014, as explained in section 6.1.6 of this
report.

6.3.5 Free cash flow

Free cash flow reached €76.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, decreasing by €43.0 million vs. the fourth
quarter of 2014. Full-year growth was €62.9 million, from €596.3 million in 2014 to €659.2 million in 2015.
This increase was mainly driven by EBITDA growth, a higher cash inflow from working capital and lower taxes
paid, partly offset by growth in capex in the period.

6.3.6 Equity investments

Equity investments amounted to €116.9 million in 2015. This cash outflow mainly corresponds to payments in
relation to the acquisition of Air IT, Itesso, Hotel SystemPro and Pyton. Equity investments in 2014 mainly
correspond to payments in relation to the acquisitions of Newmarket, UFIS and i:FAO.

6.3.7. Cash to shareholders

The cash outflow to shareholders in 2015, amounting to €598.4 million, corresponds to (i) a payment of €307.2
million related to the dividend of €0.70 per share (gross) on the 2014 profit, and (ii) €291.2 million related to
the acquisition of treasury shares in the year, most of which were acquired as part of the share buy-back
programme announced on December 11, 2014 (see section 7.3.2).

7.3. Shareholder remuneration

7.3.1 Dividend payments and dividend policy

At the Shareholders’ General Meeting held on June 25, 2015 our shareholders approved the annual gross
dividend from the profit of the year 2014. The total value of the dividend was €313.3 million, representing a
pay-out of 50% of the 2014 reported profit for the year, or €0.70 per share (gross), a 12% increase over prior
year. Regarding the payment, an interim amount of €0.32 per share (gross) was paid on January 30, 2015 and
the complementary dividend of €0.38 per share (gross) was paid on July 30, 2015.

The Board of Directors of Amadeus IT Holding, S.A held on December 10, 2015 proposed a 50% pay-out target
ratio for the year 2015 (the maximum percentage within the 40%-50% approved pay-out range).

In June 2016, the Board of directors will submit to the General Shareholders Meeting for approval a final gross
dividend of €0.775 per share, representing a 10.7% increase vs. previous year. An interim dividend of €0.34
per share (gross) was paid on January 28, 2016. Based on this, the proposed appropriation of the 2015 results
included in our 2015 audited consolidated financial statements of Amadeus IT Holding, S.A. and subsidiaries
includes a total amount of €340.1 million corresponding to dividends pertaining to the financial year 2015.

7.3.2. Share buy-back programme

The Board of Directors of Amadeus at the meeting of December 11, 2014 agreed to undertake a share buy-
back programme, in accordance with the authorisation granted to it by the General Shareholders Meeting held
on June 20, 2013, to reduce the share capital of the Company (subject to approval granted at the General
Shareholders Meeting on June 25, 2015).

The programme was completed on May 12, 2015 as the maximum planned investment of €320 million was
reached. A total of 8,759,444 own shares were acquired, representing 1.957% of share capital. All own share
acquisitions under the share buy-back programme were regularly disclosed in accordance with Article 4.4 of
Regulation 2273/2003 and were carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof.

The share capital reduction through the amortization of the repurchased shares was approved by the General
Shareholders Meeting on June 25, 2015 and registered in the Commercial Registry of Madrid on August 4,
2015.

The share repurchase programme constituted an extraordinary shareholder remuneration event which together
with the annual ordinary dividend brought substantial shareholder remuneration growth. Since our IPO,
Amadeus’ shareholder remuneration has grown consistently, evidencing its importance within the Amadeus
capital allocation process.

8 Other additional information

8.1 Expected Business Evolution

8.1.1. Macroeconomic backdrop and Amadeus business model

Amadeus is a leading technology provider and transaction processor for the global travel and tourism industry.
Our business model is transactional and volume driven. We receive from our clients - airlines and other travel
providers - a fee per transaction (mainly bookings made by online and offline travel agencies connected to the
Amadeus system, or passengers boarded by airlines using our IT solutions). Our businesses and operations are
therefore largely dependent on the worldwide travel and tourism industry, which is sensitive to general
economic conditions and trends.

As reported in the latest World Economic Outlook Update (January 2016) from the IMF, global economic growth
projection stands at 3.4% for 2016, improving vs. the 3.1% global growth in 2015.

This growth is a combination of:

—  a0.2 p.p. increase in advanced economies, expected to reach 2.1% growth in 2016. Growth in the euro
area (1.7% in 2016, vs. 1.5% in 2015) and the United States (2.6% in 2016, vs. 2.5% in 2015) should be
supported by lower oil prices and accommodative financial conditions.

—  animproving situation in emerging markets and developing economies: 4.3% growth in 2016, vs. 4.0% in
2015. Specific countries which suffered in 2015, such as Brazil or Russia, are expected to slightly recover
in 2016 (though still contracting), offsetting the expected Chinese slowdown.

The WTTC anticipated in November 20151°a total Travel & Tourism GDP growth of 3.6%, outperforming the
wider economy, forecasted at 2.9% at the time of the report.

Given the existing correlation between GDP growth and global air traffic, we expect traffic figures to mirror the
improvement in worldwide economic growth levels in 2016. IATA expects air traffic growth to reach 6.9% for
2016, a record since 2010 and an improvement vs. the 6.7% growth in 20151°. Middle East and Asia Pacific
should continue to be the fastest growing regions (12.5% and 8.0% respectively), in spite of the recent Chinese
economic fragility. Latin America is expected to grow at 6.8%, though weaknesses in key countries such as
Brazil may moderate future growth, while Europe and North America should both benefit from solid growth
rates (4-6%). Additionally the financial performance of the Air transport industry in 2016 should continue
improving, driven by a combination of volume growth, continued low energy costs and increasing ancillary
revenues.

8.1.2. Amadeus strategic priorities and expected business evolution in 2016

Distribution is Amadeus’ original business. It is management’s goal to continue to profitably grow the business,
continue to expand its addressable markets and deliver a best-in-class service to our clients. We continue to
invest in our platform, in order to support our customers in adapting to the fast changing travel industry.
Merchandising, personalisation tools and improved shopping solutions are examples of innovative solutions that
are key to our development strategy.

The term of our content agreements with airlines typically range 3-5 years. This provides the necessary
visibility and allows us to ensure our platform holds the most comprehensive content possible supporting the
enhanced value the travel agency brings as a distribution channel. During 2015 we successfully signed a new
content agreement with Air Canada and renewed contracts with airlines such as Aeromexico or Czech Airlines.

We foresee our air travel agencies bookings to grow healthily, driven by air traffic growth and an improvement
in our competitive position in Distribution.

We expect in 2016 high single-digit growth in Altéa Passengers Boarded, key driver of our IT Solutions
business, as a result of: (i) new migrations in 2016 (ii) the full year effect of 2015 migrations (iii) and the
organic traffic growth of our existing customer base. Our upselling and cross-selling capabilities should also
contribute to revenue growth.

This growth will be complemented by our acquisition of Navitaire, which accelerates our strategy of targeting
new segments within the airline IT market. We have acquired an immediate positioning in the low-cost and
hybrid carrier segments, with a strongly branded, successful and proven value proposition that matches these
segments’ specific requirements. The low-cost and hybrid carrier segments are highly innovative and attractive
for our strategy. In addition, we plan to strengthen in the future the functionality and flexibility of the current
Navitaire offering to enhance its competitiveness in its market.

Lastly, we continue to make good progress with regards to our new businesses within IT Solutions. In the Hotel
IT space, we are steadily advancing, together with InterContinental Hotels Group in the development of a new-
generation Guest Reservation System. We were also pleased to announce in 2015 our Itesso and Hotel
SystemsPro acquisitions to accelerate our Hotel IT strategy, in the Property Management systems and sales and
catering spaces, respectively. In Airport IT, we continue to see momentum in the market, particularly with our
Amadeus Airport Common Use Service (ACUS) offering, the latest example being Perth Airport. We also made
an acquisition in April 2015, Air IT, significantly expanding our presence and capabilities to serve the North
American market, a key region for the airport IT sector. In Payments, we now have a solid product portfolio,
both on the merchant and payer side, designed to help travel companies with all of their payment processing
requirements.

As a leading and differentiated technology provider for the travel industry, Amadeus will continue to invest in
R&D, a key driver to the success of our existing businesses and of our future growth. Our investment will be
related mainly to customer implementations, product evolution and portfolio expansion including non-air IT
diversification, as well as internal technological projects.

Finally, it is our objective to preserve a strong cash flow profile with a sound capital structure and ensure we
are within our stated capital structure target range (1.0x - 1.5x net debt / EBITDA). In relation to our dividend
policy, the Amadeus Board of Directors on December 10, 2015 (i) proposed a 50% pay-out target ratio for the
year 2015 (the maximum percentage within the 40%-50% approved pay-out range), and (ii) approved the
distribution of an interim dividend of €0.34 per share (gross), paid on January 28, 2016. The Board of Directors
will submit a final gross dividend of €0.775 per share from the 2015 reported profit, an increase of 10.7% vs.

previous year, to the General Shareholders Meeting for approval. Since our IPO, Amadeus’ shareholder
remuneration has grown consistently, evidencing its importance within the Amadeus capital allocation process.

8.2 Research and Development Activities

Research and development (R&D) is core to the company’s strategy and the key to a sustainable competitive
advantage. In addition, R&D activities help increase efficiency and improve the Amadeus System functionality,
as well as to reduce maintenance and operating costs.

The Group is continuously investing in its systems, including in the development of new products and
functionalities, as well as the evolution of the existing platform, based on the latest state-of-the-art technology
available. The group has 16 development centres, including 3 regional centres and the central development
sites in Nice and Bangalore.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, Amadeus expensed €243.6 million for R&D activities and capitalized
€417.2 million (before deducting any incentives), which compares to €237.6 million and €330.8 million,
respectively, in 2014.

Our R&D investment enables us to offer some of the most advanced, integrated and powerful business tools
available in the market, in order to deliver a best-in-class service to airlines and travel agencies. Indeed,
Amadeus offers enhanced functionalities, such as advanced search and booking engines, both for travel
agencies and travel providers. In addition, our product offering addresses the Passenger Service Systems for
airlines, enabling processes such as central reservation, inventory management, departure control and e-
commerce, as well as providing direct distribution technologies. We are also expanding our airline IT Solutions
offering and we are seeking to grow our market share within the non-airline IT Solutions markets, including the
hotel, rail and airport IT markets.

8.3. Environmental matters

Amadeus’ operations involve relatively low environmental risks and impacts compared with other industries.
Nonetheless, with a workforce of more than 13,000 people, presence in 195 countries and operating in a high-
energy intensity industry, we acknowledge our responsibility to minimize the company’s environmental impact
and at the same time make our contribution to the sustainability of the travel industry.

Our environmental strategy is made up of three pillars:
a) Minimising the environmental impact of Amadeus’ operations

Our environmental strategy addresses the impact of our operations and the concerns of stakeholders in the
travel industry, including customers, employees, partners, regulatory bodies and the society in general.

We believe our first responsibility is to address the environmental impact of our operations. Fortunately, for
most cases we find a common economic and environmental interest that facilitates action in reducing resource
consumption and environmental impact. Amadeus Environmental Management System includes a systematic
approach by which we:

Measure resource consumption

Identify best practices

Implement actions for improvement and
Follow up results

The items covered by the EMS include energy use, paper consumption, water use, waste generated and
greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, the EMS scope includes the top 11 Amadeus sites by number of
employees, that together represent more than 75% of the total workforce and an estimated 90% of the total
resource consumption. Importantly, the Amadeus data centre in Erding, Germany, is included in the EMS.

Additionally, our numerous sites across the world take their own environmental initiatives that range from
activities as diverse as car-pooling for commuting, recycling campaigns, reduce paper used in office through the
use of specific software, etc.

b) Helping our customers improve their environmental performance

A principal component of Amadeus’ value proposition is primarily based on increasing operational efficiencies for
our customers through our IT solutions. Often, the increased efficiencies mean more productivity, reduced
costs, better use of infrastructure and environmental benefits.

In the following paragraphs we describe three examples of Amadeus solutions that contribute to improve the
environmental performance of our customers.

Amadeus Altéa Departure Control Flight Management

Thanks to optimization tools, Amadeus Altéa Departure Control System (DCS) Flight Management (FM) allows
customers saving a significant amount of fuel and greenhouse gas emissions, compared with less sophisticated
technologies currently in the market.

The savings achieved were measured analysing a sample of more than 40,000 flights from Finnair, of which
approximately half were using Amadeus solution and the other half the previous system used by Finnair. The
analysis proved a higher precision from Altéa DCS when estimating the estimated zero fuel weight of the
aircraft (EZFW) which translates into improvements in the estimation of the fuel needed for each flight,
resulting in significant savings in costs, fuel and emissions.

Amadeus Sequence Manager

Airport Sequence Manager optimises the flight departure process. The solution relies on sophisticated
sequencing algorithms to calculate the Target Start-Up Approval Time (TSAT) for each departing flight. This
allows the aircraft to leave the stand at the last possible moment, reducing fuel burn, economic costs and
environmental impact, and it enables better allocation of resources. Runway capacity can therefore be
optimised at times of congestion, or de-icing processes taken into account during winter season. As a
collaborative tool, Amadeus Airport Sequence Manager creates a shared situational awareness among all airport
partners.

Amadeus launched Airport Sequence Manager in collaboration with Munich Airport - one of the busiest
European airports, with nearly 400,000 aircraft movements per year.

Amadeus Airport Common Use Service (ACUS)

In 2014, we launched Amadeus’ cloud-based Airport Common Use Service (ACUS). With ACUS, airports are
able to transfer hosting and development responsibilities to Amadeus. Our full, thin client solution and
application virtualisation approach reduce the requirement for costly on-site hardware equipment, servers and
local data centres, as well as IT maintenance. This generates substantial operational savings for the airport and
reduces the overall environmental footprint. Energy consumption is substantially lower compared to traditional
common use solutions.

In 2015, we launched Amadeus Schedule Recovery, which minimises disruptions to operations caused by
external events such as bad weather or air traffic congestion. The solution, among other features, helps
accommodate to the new situation minimising environmental impact.

c) Cooperation with industry stakeholders in sustainability projects in our sector

The environmental sustainability in our sector is a common objective for all industry stakeholders. In the
environmental area we take advantage of our data management capability, technology, expertise and network
to make our contribution towards industry sustainability.

We include below some examples of our participation with other stakeholders in the industry in relation to
environmental sustainability objectives.

Industry standards for carbon calculation per passenger in aviation

The calculation of emissions per passenger in aviation is complicated for various reasons and therefore,
different calculation methodologies offer considerably different emissions estimations for the same itinerary. It
is important that a standard calculation methodology complies with neutrality, global reach and legitimacy
requirements.

The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and Amadeus reached an agreement by which Amadeus
uses ICAO’s carbon calculator to show our customers the CO, estimations in our distribution platforms; and by
doing this we promote the use of ICAO’s carbon calculator and help raising environmental awareness in the
sector. The agreement was initially signed in 2009 and renewed in 2015.

Participation in common projects with industry stakeholders

It’s fundamental that industry stakeholders work together and agree on strategies and responsibilities towards
sustainability. From Amadeus we participate in various forums and specific projects with trade associations like
the World Travel and Tourism Council or United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO).

Regarding our sustainability efforts, it’s important for us to receive feedback from external sustainability
indices, in order to understand how we perform as compared to other companies, to identify areas of focus for
the future and to improve the quality and transparency of our non-financial reporting. Since 2012 Amadeus has
remained for four consecutive years among top sustainability scorers and therefore, members of the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index (DJSI). Amadeus score in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) was 98 in disclosure (range
O - 100) and B in performance (range E-A).

Finally, the Amadeus risk and opportunity analysis regarding climate change depicts that our main risks are
physical, regulatory and reputational risks. On the other hand our opportunities are linked to the possibility of
launching new products and services and improving our competitive positioning.

The Group holds treasury shares for the future specific share delivery commitments with the Group employees
and management.

8.5 Financial Risks

The Group has exposure, as a result of the normal course of its business activities, to foreign exchange, inter-
est rate, own shares price evolution, credit and liquidity risk. The goal of the Group is to identify, measure and
minimize these risks using the most effective and efficient methods to eliminate, reduce, or transfer such expo-
sures. With the purpose of managing these risks, in some occasions, the Group enters into hedging activities
with derivatives and non-derivative instruments.

8.5.1 Foreign exchange rate risk

The reporting currency in the Group’s consolidated annual accounts is the Euro (EUR). As a result of the multi-
national orientation of its business, the Group is subject to foreign exchange rate risks derived from the fluctua-
tions of many currencies. The target of the Group’s foreign exchange hedging strategy is to reduce the volatility
of the Euro value of the consolidated foreign currency denominated cash flows. The instruments used to
achieve this goal depend on the denomination currency of the operating cash flow to be hedged:

— The strategy for US Dollar (USD) exposures is based on the use of natural hedges and of derivatives. This
strategy aims at reducing the exposure created by the USD denominated operating cash inflows of the
Group with the USD payments of principals of the USD denominated debt and with derivatives, although as
of December 31, 2015, there has no USD denominated debt.

Page 46

Amadeus IT Holding, S.A. and Subsidiaries

Consolidated Annual Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2015
(Millions of euros) aMa DEUS

— Aside from the USD, the foreign currency exposures are expenditures denominated in a variety of foreign
currencies. The most significant of these exposures are denominated in Sterling Pounds (GBP), Australian
Dollars (AUD) and Swedish Kronas (SEK). For these exposures, a natural hedge strategy is not possible. In
order to hedge a significant portion of the aforementioned short exposures (net expenditures) the Group
can engage into derivative contracts with banks: basically currency forwards, currency options and combi-
nations of currency options.

Provided that the objective in relation with the foreign exchange rate risk is reducing the volatility of the EUR
value of the foreign currency denominated cash flows, the total exposure of the Group to changes in the foreign
exchange rates is measured in terms of Cash-flow at Risk (CFaR). This risk measure provides an estimate of
the potential EUR loss of the foreign currency denominated cash flows from the moment the estimation is calcu-
lated to the moment the cash flow is expected to take place. These estimates are made using a 95% confidence
level.

The CFaR methodology is similar in many respects to the Value at Risk (VaR) methodology. However, whereas
VaR is generally centred in the changes in the value of a portfolio of exposures in a given future interval of
time, CFaR is focused on the changes in the value of the cash-flows of that portfolio from the calculation date to
the moment in which these cash-flows effectively take place. CFaR is a more adequate measure of the risk of
the Group given that the goal of our risk management strategy with relation to foreign exchange risk is reduc-
ing the volatility of the EUR value of the foreign currency denominated cash-flows. An additional reason for
focusing on cash-flows is that, eventually, the cash-flows of a company result in its level of liquidity which in
the case of a non-financial corporation it is generally a scarce and valuable element.

The main limitations of the CFaR methodology are very similar to the ones of the VaR methodology:

— One of the limitations of this methodology is that its results are based on several of hypotheses on the fu-
ture volatilities of the exchange rates and the future correlation among them which may correspond with
the real evolution of the exchange rates or not’.

— Additionally, the foreign exchange exposure estimates used as inputs to the model may deviate with re-
spect to the exposures which will finally take place in the future?®.

— Finally, it is important to mention that given a level of CFaR calculated with a 95% confidence level, the
losses which could take place in the remaining 5% of the cases may be significantly greater than the level
of risk as measured with the CFaR methodology.

The CFaR of the foreign exchange exposures of the Group calculated with a 95% confidence level is set forth in

the table below:

2016 CFaR 2017 CFaR. 2018 CFaR 2015CFaR 2016 CFaR 2017 CFaR

(20.3) (49.1) (75.9) (4.7) (28.6) (55.5)

"The volatilities implicit in the market prices of currency options and the historic correlations among the main currencies in which Amadeus has
exposures are used as inputs to the model.

18 In order to calculate the foreign currency exposures of the Group we take into account the estimated cash flows in each currency according
to the last available forecast and the foreing currency hedges contracted as of the CFaR calculation date.

There are two main reasons for the increase in the CFaR levels of the Group for the next three years with re-
spect to the CFaR levels outstanding at the end of 2014. On one side, a greater US Dollar exposure as a conse-
quence of the growth of Amadeus business in the United States and Asia. Additionally, the hedges in US Dollars
(USD) have been kept at reduced levels for the next three years

As it can be observed in the table above, the level of risk measured in CFaR terms tends to increase for the
periods which are further away. The reasons for this are: (1) the further away the future cash-flows are, more
adverse the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations can be potentially; (2) the level of hedging is smaller for the
later periods; (3) in the later periods the size of the foreign exchange exposures tends to be greater.

8.5.2 Interest rate risk

The objective of the Group in terms of interest rate risk management is reducing the volatility of the net inter-
est flows payable by the Group. In line with this goal as of December 2015 approximately 92% (87% as of De-
cember 2014) of the debt contracted by the Group was fixed rate debt. Given the high proportion of fixed rate
debt as of December 2015 no interest rate hedges were hedging this debt as of this date (as of December 2014
the proportion of fixed rate debt after hedges was 94%).

As of December 2015 the only outstanding interest rate derivative was hedging future debt that it is expected
to be contracted during 2016 as part of the refinancing of the €750mill Eurobond maturing on July 2016.

Although the interest rate hedge mentioned above fixes the amount of interests to be paid by Amadeus in fu-
ture years, its fair value is sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates. In the table below you can see an
estimation of the Group’s sensitivity to a 0.1% (10 bps) parallel shift of the interest rate curve:

The sensitivity of fair value to parallel changes in the interest rate curve as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 is

set forth in the table below:

ne | toons | — Ea
EUR denominated debt 5.34 (5.37) 4.21 (4.20)
USD denominated debt - - - -
EUR accounting hedges 1.48 (1.57) 1.41 (1.63)
USD accounting hedges - - 0.06 (0.06)
Total 6.82 (6.94) 5.68 (5.89)

In 2015 there has been an increase in the sensitivity of the EUR denominated debt to the movements of the
interest rate curve with respect to the previous year. This increase is due to the increase in the duration of the
outstanding debt portfolio due to the issuance of a new 6 year Eurobond during 2015. Although the future flows
of the fixed rate debt instruments are not sensitive to the changes in the level of interest rates, the fair value of
the instruments are sensitive to these changes.

According to the table above a 10 bps drop in the level of interest rates would cause a loss in the fair value of
the debt (an increase of the liability) and the derivatives in the Amadeus hedging portfolio amounting to €6.95
mill at December 31, 2015, and €5.89 mill at December 31, 2014 respectively. However, given that the chang-
es in the fair value of the derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recognized directly in equity and the
debt is measured at amortized cost, the impact of a 10 bps drop in the level of interest rates would imply no

Page 48

(Millions of euros) aMa DEUS

loss recognized in the profit for the year at December 31, 2015 and 2014, since the derivative in the interest
rate portfolio of the Group is to be accounted as a cash-flow hedge.

In cash flow terms, in the case of a parallel drop (or rise) in the level of interest rates the lower (or higher)
interests payable for the debt which is hedged, would be compensated by a similar amount of higher (or lower)
debt interests to be paid during the life of the hedges (cash flow hedge concept).

8.5.3. Own shares price evolution risk

As of December 31, 2015, the Group has three different remuneration schemes outstanding which are settled
with Amadeus shares; the Performance Share Plan (PSP), the Restricted Share Plan (RSP) and the Share Match
Plan.

According to the rules of these plans, when they mature their beneficiaries will receive a number of Company’s
shares which for the outstanding plans will be (depending on the evolution of certain performance conditions)
between a maximum of 2,210,000 shares and a minimum of 270,000 shares, approximately. It is Amadeus
intention to make use of its 2,214,916 treasury shares to settle these plans at their maturity.

8.5.4 Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial asset will cause a loss for the Group by failing to dis-
charge an obligation.

Amadeus’ cash and cash equivalents are deposited in major banks on the basis of diversification and the credit
risk of the available investment alternatives.

The credit risk of Amadeus’ customer accounts receivable is mitigated by the fact that the majority are settled
through the clearing houses operated by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) and Airlines Clear-
ing House, Inc. (“ACH”). These systems guarantee that the cash inflows from our customers will be settled at a
certain fixed date, and mitigate the credit risk partially by the fact that the members of the clearing house are
required to make deposits that would be used in the event of default. Moreover, our customer base is large and
unrelated which results in a low concentration of our credit risk.

8.5.5 Liquidity risk

The Corporate Treasury is responsible for providing the cash needed by all the companies of the Group. In or-
der to perform this task more efficiently the Group concentrates the excess liquidity of the subsidiaries with
excess cash and channel it to the companies with cash needs.

This allocation of the cash position among the companies of the Group is mainly made through:
— Acash pooling agreement with most of the subsidiaries located in the Euro area.
— Through bilateral Treasury Optimization agreements between Amadeus IT Group, S.A. and its subsidiaries.

Corporate Treasury monitors the Group’s cash position through rolling forecasts of expected cash flows. These
forecasts are performed by the subsidiaries of the Group and later on consolidated in order to examine both the
liquidity situation and prospects of the Group and its subsidiaries.

In addition to other smaller treasury lines agreed with several banks, the Group has access to a Revolving
Credit facility with two different tranches. One of these tranches has a notional of €500 mill which can be used
to cover working capital needs and general corporate purposes. The other tranche also has a notional of €500
mill and its use is restricted to the partial refinancing of the Eurobond issued by Amadeus Capital Markets,

S.A.U., amounting to KEUR 750.000, maturing on July 2016. As of December 31, 2015, all the outstanding
Revolving Credit facilities are unused.

Finally, in December 2014, Amadeus set up a Multi-Currency European Commercial Paper (ECP) program. This
program can be used for raising short term financing up to a maximum notional of €500 mill. As of December
31, 2015 €196.5 mill of this program are in use.

8.6 Subsequent events

On January 26, 2016, after receiving all the necessary regulatory approvals, the Group indirectly through its
subsidiary Amadeus IT Group, S.A., acquired 100% of the ownership interest of Navitaire, LLC and certain as-
sets and assumed certain liabilities primarily related to the Navitaire business, including 100% of the ownership
interest of Navitaire Philippines Inc. (“Navitaire”). The transaction was structured as a carve-out from the pre-
vious owner as the Navitaire business was embedded within the Accenture group. About 590 employees, includ-
ing the senior management team, has joined Amadeus.

Navitaire is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.A. and it operates offices in London, Manila, Salt Lake City
and Sydney. The addition of Navitaire’s portfolio of products and solutions for the low-cost segment comple-
ments Amadeus’ Altéa Suite of offerings for its largely full-service carrier customer base, giving the company
the ability to serve a wider group of airlines. Amadeus will market and sell the two product portfolios separately
and will continue to invest in both platforms, enhancing the services and functionality availability to all types of
carriers.

Through separate agreements, Accenture will provide Amadeus with infrastructure outsourcing, application and
R&D services. These agreements have a term from 5 to 10 years, and annual targeted service commitments
and investment in joint developments with benchmark mechanisms to adjust to fair value of the services re-
ceived.

The cash consideration transferred in relation to this acquisition amounted to €766.5 mill ($844.4 mill). The
acquisition-related costs incurred amounted to approximately €6.7 mill, all of which were recognised in “Other
operating expenses” in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31,
2015.

Details of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, revenue and profit for the peri-
od are not disclosed, as the accounting for this transaction is still incomplete at the time of the consolidated
annual accounts were authorized for issue. Under the acquisition agreements the seller has 120 days to provide
information as at the acquisition date. Amadeus will consolidate Navitaire with effect from January 26, 2016.

On January 25, 2016, the Group has disposed of in full the funds that were available on July 3, 2015, by means
of a Term Loan Facility with a maximum principal amount of €500 mill. The purpose of this facility was to par-
tially finance the acquisition of Navitaire. The loan has scheduled repayments for 2019 and 2020. The Term
Loan Facility has a margin of 0.75% over the variable interest rate of EURIBOR.

On February 12, 2016, the Group has received the formal notification from the Central Administrative Court
(TEAC) allowing the appeal presented to the TEAC in July 2015 with regard to the tax assessment signed under
protest related to the Non-Residents Income Tax for the year 2007.
