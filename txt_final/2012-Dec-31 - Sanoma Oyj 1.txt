BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Board of Directors’ Report

On 5 March 2012, Sanoma announced that it had signed an agreement
to sell its kiosk operations in Finland, Estonia and Lithuania as well as
its press distribution operations in Estonia and Lithuania. According
to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), any material
divestment that represents a separate major line of business shall be
classified as a discontinued operation. Hence, Sanoma classified these
operations to be divested as discontinued operations for the 2012
reporting. The discontinued operations are eliminated from the Con-
solidated Income Statement and only the result for the period of these
discontinued operations is presented as a separate item after the result
for the continuing operations. Accordingly, the Consolidated Income
Statement for 2011 has been restated.

In addition, Sanoma renewed its operative reporting from the third
quarter of 2012. The continuing operations of the Group include three
reportable segments: Media, News and Learning, As a result, the Trade
segment is no longer a reportable segment. Trade’s remaining opera-
tions are reported in the line item ‘Other companies and eliminations’.
Aldipress from the Media segment’s ‘Other businesses’ and all remain-
ing ‘Other businesses’ from the Learning segment are reported in the
line item ‘Other companies and eliminations’. The line item ‘Other
companies and eliminations’ includes non-core operations, head office
functions, real estate companies and Group eliminations.

Net sales

In 2012, Sanoma’s net sales were stable and amounted to EUR 2,376.3
million (2011: EUR 2,378.1 million; 2010: EUR 2,761.2 million). The
deterioration in circulation and advertising markets during 2012
adversely affected net sales in Media and News segments. The decline
was offset by the consolidation of the acquired SBS TV and print opera-
tions in the Netherlands and Belgium as well as increased sales of the
Learning segment and Nelonen Media in Finland. Currency transla-
tions did not have a material effect on the 2012 net sales. When adjusted
for changes in the Group structure, net sales decreased by 3.3%.

Circulation sales decreased by 2.1%. Subscription sales increased by
1.1%, while single copy sales decreased by 6.3%, mainly as a result of
declining trends, including increased volatility in single copy markets.
In Finland, the introduction of VAT from the beginning of 2012 also
adversely affected print subscription sales.

Total advertising sales increased by 11.8%. Within total advertising,
online advertising increased by 3.9%.

Sanoma’s online, TV and radio advertising sales grew by 33.3% to
EUR 4864 million (2011: EUR 364.8 million) and accounted for 20.5%
(2011: 15.3%) of the Group’s net sales, mainly due to the consolidation
of the acquired TV operations in the Netherlands and Belgium.

By country, the Netherlands accounted for 37.7% (2011: 32.5%), Fin-
land for 36.6% (2011: 41.7%) and Belgium for 11.0% (2011: 10.2%) of
the Group's 2012 net sales. Net sales from other EU countries totalled
10.7% (2011: 11.6%) and non-EU countries accounted for 3.9% (2011:
4.0%).

By type of sales, advertising sales accounted for 36.7% (2011: 32.8%),
subscription sales for 20.3% (2011: 20.1%), single copy sales for 14.0%
(2011: 14.9%), learning for 12.9% (2011: 10.8%) and other sales for
16.1% (2011: 21.4%) of the Group's 2012 net sales. Other sales include
mainly press distribution and marketing services, language and trans-
lation services, custom publishing, event marketing, other literature
and print sales.

Result

In 2012, Sanoma’s operating profit excluding non-recurring items
increased by 3.6% and totalled EUR 232.3 million (2011: EUR 224.1
million). The weak development of advertising and circulation sales
lowered the result in the Media and News segments. The decline was
more than offset by the consolidation of the acquired SBS TV and print
operations in the Netherlands and Belgium as well as the improved
result in the Learning segment. Higher investments in TV program-
ming rights in the Netherlands also affected the Sanoma Media
Netherlands strategic business unit’s result in 2012. In the compara-
ble period, operating profit excluding non-recurring items included
EUR 34.4 million of one-off transaction costs and order backlog amor-
tisations related to the SBS acquisition, which were not categorised
as non-recurring. Operating profit excluding non-recurring items
amounted to 9.8% (2011: 9.4%) of net sales. Currency translations
did not have a material effect on the 2012 result. Sanoma’s operating
profit in 2012 was EUR 182.3 million (2011: EUR 172.6 million; 2010:
EUR 392.7 million) or 7.7% (2011: 7.3%; 2010: 14.2%) of net sales.

The non-recurring items included in the operating profit amounted
to EUR -50.0 million (2011: EUR -51.5 million) and included impair-
ments of goodwill and intangible assets, restructuring expenses and
gain on the sale of assets. In 2011, non-recurring items related to
impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, restructuring expenses
and gain on the sale of assets. Sanoma’s 2012 result included EUR -17.7
million (2011: EUR-3.7 million) of profits from associated companies.
Non-recurring items included in the result of associated companies
amounted to EUR-17.5 million (2011: EUR -4.0 million) and consisted
of again and a loss on sales as well as an impairment.

Sanoma’s net financial items totalled EUR -57.4 million (2011:
EUR -32.7 million). Financial income amounted to EUR 18.2 million
(2011: EUR 13.9 million), of which EUR 11.6 million were exchange
rate gains (2011: EUR 9.3 million). Financial expenses amounted
to EUR -75.6 million (2011: EUR -46.6 million), of which EUR -12.6
million were exchange rate losses (2011: EUR -16.2 million). Interest
expenses amounted to EUR -52.9 million (2011: EUR -28.8 million).

Profit before taxes amounted to EUR 107.3 million (2011: EUR
136.3 million) and the effective tax rate was 19.8% (2011: 40.3 %). The
effective tax rate in 2012 was affected mainly by non-taxable sales
gains. In the comparable year, the tax rate was impacted mainly by the
impairments of goodwill and non-taxable sales gains and losses.

Non-recurring items included in the discontinued operations
amounted to EUR 77.4 million (2011: EUR -4.7 million) and consisted
mainly of a gain on the sale of kiosk operations.

Earnings per share were EUR 0.88 (2011: EUR 0.52), of which EUR
0.40 (2011: EUR 0.47) relates to continuing operations and EUR 0.49
(2011: EUR 0.05) to discontinued operations. Earnings per share
excluding non-recurring items were EUR 0.78 (2011: EUR 0.87).

Balance sheet and financial position

At the end of 2012, Sanoma’s consolidated balance sheet totalled
EUR 4,041.6 million (2011: EUR 4,328.3 million). In 2012, the Group’s
cash flow from operations was EUR 192.0 million (2011: EUR 273.8
million). Cash flow from operations per share was EUR 1.18 (2011:
EUR 1.68).

Sanoma’s equity ratio was 42.4% (2011: 37.0%; 2010: 45.7%) at the
end of 2012. The return on equity (ROE) was 9.6% (2011: 5.9%; 2010:
23.0%) and the return on investment (ROI) was 8.2% (2011: 6.8%; 2010:
16.2%). In 2011, the acquisition of the TV and print operations in the
Netherlands and Belgium negatively affected these ratios. Equity
totalled EUR 1,628.6 million (2011: EUR 1,524.2 million). The equity
per share was EUR 8.14 (2011: EUR 7.70). Interest-bearing liabilities
at the end of the December 2012 totalled EUR 1,408.7 million (2011:
EUR 1,727.2 million). Interest-bearing net debt was EUR 1,241.5 mil-
lion (2011: EUR 1,611.2 million).

On 13 March 2012, Sanoma Corporation issued its first ever corpo-
rate bond, a EUR 400 million five-year Senior Unsecured Eurobond,
under investment grade documentation without any financial cov-
enants. The bond pays a fixed coupon of 5.000% and had an issue price
of 99.413, equivalent to a yield of 5.136%.

On 6 July 2012, Sanoma Corporation signed a new EUR 600 million
Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility with a five-year maturity. The
margin depends on the leverage of the borrower, the initial margin
being 1.5% over Euribor. The new facility replaced the former EUR 802
million Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility.

Investments, acquisitions and divestments

In January-December, investments in tangible and intangible assets,
including finance leases, amounted to EUR 59.5 million (2011:
EUR 76.2 million). Investments were mainly related to ICT systems
as well as replacements and renovation. In the comparable period, the
renewal of the long-term rental agreements of the divested movie oper-
ations accounted for about one third of the total investments.

In 2012, Sanoma’s business acquisitions totalled EUR 27.3 million
(2011: EUR 1,415.2 million). The impact of each individual acquisition
on the Group’s assets and liabilities was minor. The combined effect
of the acquisitions since the acquisition date on the Group's net sales
amounted to EUR 17.1 million, and on operating profit excluding non-
recurring items to EUR 1.7 million,

In January, Sanoma Media Netherlands increased its ownership in
the Dutch joint venture Hemels from 51% to 71%. The first 51% was
acquired in 2011. Consolidation of Hemels continues using the propor-
tional consolidation method, by the share of 71%, Hemels operates in
custom publishing.

In March, Sanoma sold its entire 21.11% shareholding in Finnish
telecommunications group DNA Ltd and received a EUR 181.5 million

cash consideration for the shareholding. As a result of the transaction,
Sanoma recognised a non-tax-deductible non-recurring capital loss of
EUR-19.3 million in the first quarter of 2012.

In April, Sanoma divested its book logistics company Porvoon Kir-
jakeskus Oy, As a result of the transaction, Sanoma recognised a non-
taxable capital gain of EUR 0.1 million in the second quarter of 2012.

In May, Sanoma sold its kiosk operations in Finland, Estonia and
Lithuania and its press distribution operations in Estonia and Lithua-
nia, including the Rautakirja trade mark, as well as its bookstore opera-
tions in Estonia. As a result, Sanoma recognised a non-taxable non-
recurring capital gain of EUR 77.4 million in the second quarter of 2012.
According to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), any
material divestment that represents a separate major line of business
shall be classified as a discontinued operation. Hence, Sanoma classified
these operations to be divested as discontinued operations for the 2012
reporting. The discontinued operations are eliminated from the Con-
solidated Income Statement and only the result for the period of these
discontinued operations is presented as a separate item after the result
for the continuing operations. Accordingly, the Consolidated Income
Statement for 2011 has been restated.

In May, Sanoma Media Netherlands acquired online retail group
Read & View in the Netherlands. The result of the company has been
consolidated to Sanoma from the beginning of May 2012.

Rock, by purchasing Radio SuomiPOP, Groove FM and Metro FM. The
result of the acquired operations has been consolidated to Sanoma from
the beginning of the third quarter of 2012.

In July, Sanoma Media Belgium acquired and closed the acquisition
of communication agency HeadOffice. Head Office is a relationship mar-

of the new company has been consolidated to Sanoma from the begin-
ning of the third quarter of 2012.

quarter of 2012.

In November, Sanoma Media Netherlands acquired 40% of the
shares in the Dutch e-commerce company SB Commerce, owner of,

BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT

°

Group outlook for 2013

In 2013, Sanoma expects to maintain its financial performance com-
pared to 2012 and estimates that in 2013 net sales and operating profit
excluding non-recurring items will be a continuation of 2012.

Sanoma’s outlook for 2013 is based on assumptions that the Euro-
pean economic situation remains subdued and the likelihood of an
advertising market recovery during 2013 is low.

The first quarter for the Group is seasonally the weakest. In addi-
tion, Sanoma will invest materially in the Dutch and Finnish TV
operations as well as digital development. Hence, the operating profit
excluding non-recurring items will be negative for the Group in the
first quarter of 2013.

Three-year, Group-wide cost savings programme

As a part of streamlining operations and ensuring competitive cost
levels, Sanoma has commenced a three-year, Group-wide cost savings
programme. Sanoma’s target is to reduce its cost base by EUR 60 mil-
lion gross by the end of 2015 compared to the cost level of 2012. The
targeted EUR 60 million gross saving consists of EUR 30 million of
cost savings in support functions and EUR 30 million related to opera-
tional efficiency.

Media

The Media segment includes magazine, TV, radio and online busi-
nesses in 11 European countries and comprises four strategic business
units: Sanoma Media Netherlands, Sanoma Media Finland, Sanoma
Media Belgium and Sanoma Media Russia & CEE.

In 2012, the Media segment’s net sales increased by 8.6% to
EUR 1,487.1 million (2011: EUR 1,369.2 million). The growth came
mainly from the consolidation of the acquired SBS TV and print oper-
ations in the Netherlands and Belgium, which more than offset lower
circulation and magazine advertising sales. Adjusted for structural
changes, net sales decreased by 5.9%.

The segment'’s advertising sales grew by 18.6% and represented
45.0% (2011: 41.2%) of the segment's net sales in 2012. Online adver-
tising sales increased by 2.7%, as most of the business units showed
growth.

The segment’s print circulation sales decreased by 1.7% and rep-
resented 42.6% (2011: 47.1%) of the segment’s net sales in 2012. Sin-
gle copy sales decreased somewhat and subscription sales increased
slightly.

Sanoma’s online, TV and radio advertising sales in the Media seg-
ment increased by 36.3%, due to the consolidation of the acquired TV
operations in the Netherlands and Belgium, and represented 29.9%
(2011: 23.9%) of the segment’s 2012 net sales.

In Sanoma Media Netherlands, net sales increased by 18.4% to
EUR 760.4 million (2011: EUR 642.0 million) mainly due to the con-
solidation of the acquired TV and print operations as of August 2011.
Advertising sales increased significantly, and represented 46.2% (2011:
40.9%) of the Dutch net sales. Sanoma estimates that the net TV adver-
tising market in the Netherlands decreased by around 6% in 2012.
Online advertising sales excluding acquired operations remained at
the comparable year's level. Sanoma estimates that the net consumer
magazine advertising market decreased by around 12% in 2012. Maga-
zine operations’ sales, including the acquired operation, remained at
the comparable year's level. Single copy sales decreased somewhat
compared to the comparable quarter. Subscription sales, including
the acquired operation, increased somewhat. Circulation sales rep-
resented 42.4% (2011: 48.9%) of the Dutch net sales. The declining
trends in the readers market continued.

In Sanoma Media Finland, net sales decreased by 2.6% to
EUR 301.7 million (2011: EUR 309.7 million) as slightly growing TV
and radio sales, including acquired radio operations, did not offset
somewhat decreasing magazine operations’ sales. According to TNS
Gallup Adex, the net TV advertising market in Finland decreased by
around 1% in 2012. The net magazine advertising market decreased
by about 8%. In total, advertising sales of the Finnish operations rep-
resented 44.0% (2011: 42.0%) of net sales in 2012. Subscription sales
decreased somewhat and single copy sales decreased slightly. Circula-
tion in total represented 42.9% (2011: 44.3%) of the Finnish net sales.

Net sales in Sanoma Media Belgium increased by 9.2% to
EUR 228.3 million (2011: EUR 209.1 million) due to acquired opera-
tions. Magazine operations’ sales excluding acquired operations
declined somewhat, as advertising sales decreased clearly and circula-
tion sales declined somewhat. Sanoma estimates that the net magazine
advertising market decreased by around 15% and the net TV advertis-
ing market decreased by some 9% in 2012. Sanoma’s TV operations in
the Flemish part of Belgium continued to strengthen its share of view-
ing and consequently improved its advertising market share to 28.3%
(2011: 25.4%). In total, advertising sales represented 33.5% (2011:
29.5%) and circulation sales 49.7% (2011: 55.3%) of the net sales in
Belgium.

In 2011, there were a number of structural changes in Sanoma
Media Belgium. The reported figures include 51% of the weekly maga-
zine Humo until May 2011. In connection with the SBS acquisition,
the remaining holding in Hwmowas transferred to De Vijver. On 1 Sep-
tember 2011, Belgian competition authorities approved a joint control
structure of De Vijver; following this approval Sanoma's 33% share
in De Vijver Media (which includes 100% of Humo, the acquired TV
operations as well as the TV productions operations of Woestijnvis) is
proportionally consolidated line-by-line.

In Sanoma Media Russia & CEE, net sales decreased by 6.4% to
EUR 199.5 million (2011: EUR 213.1 million) due to continued pres-
sure mainly on circulation sales. Advertising sales in the Sanoma
Media Russia & CEE strategic business unit remained at the compa-
rable year's level. In total, advertising sales represented 54.5% (2011:
51.8%) of net sales in the Sanoma Media Russia & CEE strategic busi-



--- Page 4 ---

ness unit. Following the declining market trends and pressure on con-
sumer purchasing power, single copy and subscription sales continued
to fall down in most countries. Circulation sales decreased therefore
clearly, and represented 34.0% (2011: 36.5%) of the strategic business
unit’s net sales. Service and product portfolios are optimised according
to their future development potential as well as to reflect changes in
the market environment.

In the Media segment, operating profit excluding non-recurring
items increased by 1.1% to EUR 151.2 million (2011: EUR 149.5 mil-
lion), as consolidation of the acquired operations as well as good
development in online and Finnish TV operations offset lower results
in magazine operations in all strategic business units. In the compa-
rable period, operating profit excluding non-recurring items included
EUR 34.4 million of one-off transaction costs and order backlog amor-
tisations related to the SBS acquisition, which were not categorised as
non-recurring. Non-recurring items included in the operating profit
totalled EUR -21.2 million (2011: EUR -59.1 million) and included
impairments of goodwill and intangibles, restructuring expenses, loss
on sale of assets and expenses in relation to efficiency improvement
projects. In the comparable year, non-recurring items were related to
impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, restructuring expenses
and gains on the sale of assets.

Media’s investments in tangible and intangible assets totalled
EUR 30.7 million (2011: EUR 21.9 million) and consisted mainly of
ICT investments for business support and digital developments. The
most significant acquisitions made in 2012 were online retail group
Read & View in the Netherlands, three commercial radio stations in
Finland and content marketing company HeadOffice in Belgium. In
2011, the most significant acquisition was the acquisition of the SBS
TV and print operations in the Netherlands and Belgium.

The News segment includes the Sanoma News strategic business unit,
Finland’s leading player in newspaper publishing and online media.

In 2012, net sales decreased by 3.0% to EUR 422.8 million (2011: EUR
435.8 million). Adjusted for structural changes, sales decreased by 3.6%.

Print circulation sales decreased by 3.1%, as both single copy and
subscription sales declined slightly. Circulation sales accounted for
42.7% (2011: 42.8%) of the segment's net sales.

Advertising sales decreased by 6.0% due to adverse market condi-
tions. Print advertising declined somewhat whereas online advertis-
ing increased somewhat. Advertising sales represented 48.4% (2011:
50.0%) of the segment's net sales.

According to TNS Gallup Adex, the net newspaper advertising mar-
ket in Finland decreased by about 9% in 2012. Online advertising (net)
included in the statistics was up by some 10%.

Total digital sales increased by 10.5%. Digital sales, consisting mostly
of advertising, but also increasingly services and content, represented
13.8% (2011: 12.1%) of the segment’s net sales.

The Helsingin Sanomat business unit's net sales decreased by 5.7%.
The underlying macro-economic uncertainty affected recruitment
advertising sales in particular. Accordingly, advertising sales decreased
clearly and represented 51.7% (2011: 53.9%) of the business unit's net
sales. Subscription sales decreased slightly, partly driven by the intro-
duction of VAT on print subscriptions from the beginning of 2012.

The Ilta-Sanomat business unit's net sales decreased by 0.1%. Adver-
tising sales increased somewhat, as online advertising increased sig-
nificantly, and represented 29.8% (2011: 28.3%) of the business unit’s
net sales. Circulation sales declined slightly. The total volume of the
Finnish print tabloid market decreased somewhat during 2012. Ilta-
Sanomat continued to strengthen its market leadership and the mar-
ket share was 59.2% (2011: 58.3%) of the tabloid newsstand market in
2012.

Net sales from other publishing operations decreased by 0.6%. In
regional papers, advertising increased slightly and circulation sales
were at the comparable year’s level. Advertising sales in free sheets

decreased significantly. Sanoma News is focusing an increasing
amount of resources to develop its digital operations. Net sales for the
Sanoma Digital business unit increased by 5.9%.

News’ operating profit excluding non-recurring items decreased by
34.5% to EUR 32.4 million (2011: EUR 49.4 million) mainly due to a
significantly lower result of the Helsingin Sanomat business unit. Non-
recurring items included in the operating profit totalled EUR -11.9 mil-
lion (2011: EUR -9.2 million) and were related to an ICT system and
restructuring costs. In the comparable year, non-recurring items were
related to pension and exit packages.

News’ investments in tangible and intangible assets totalled
EUR 11.0 million (2011: EUR 16.9 million), and consisted mainly of
investments in digital business, ICT and replacement investment in
printing. There were no material acquisitions in 2012 or in the com-
parable year.

In 2012, The Learning segment’s net sales increased by 7.5% to
EUR 312.4 million (2011: EUR 290.6 million), mainly related to struc-
tural changes and improved underlying performance. Adjusted for
structural changes, net sales increased by 8.6%.

The learning business has, by nature, an annual cycle and strong
seasonality. It accrues most of its net sales and results during the sec-
ond and third quarters, whereas the first and fourth quarter are typi-
cally loss-making.

The Learning business unit's net sales increased by 19.4% to
EUR 306.4 million (2011: EUR 256.6 million), mainly related to struc-
tural changes and improved underlying performance. In the Nether-
lands, net sales increased slightly, whilst the market decreased. In Bel-
gium, sales increased and the market position in primary education
continued to strengthen, supported by online solutions. In Finland,
net sales grew, driven by new online services and asa result of acquired
operations. In Sweden, net sales grew somewhat driven by improved
market share. In Hungary, upcoming reforms caused uncertainty in
spending. In Poland, sales increased significantly as Sanoma strength-
ened its market position after a curriculum reform.

The Finnish general literature publisher WSOY was divested in
early October 2011 and it is no longer included in Learning’s figures
from the fourth quarter of 2011.

The book logistics company Porvoon Kirjakeskus Oy was divested in
April 2012 and it is no longer included in Learning's figures from the
beginning of April 2012.

The business information service provider Esmerk was divested in
June 2012 and it is no longer included in Learning's figures from the
beginning of June 2012.

Learning segment’s operating profit excluding non-recurring items

Seasonal fluctuation

The net sales and results of media businesses are particularly affected
by the development of advertising. Advertising sales are influenced,
for example, by the number of newspaper and magazine issues pub-
lished each quarter, which varies annually. Television advertising in
the Netherlands, Finland and Belgium is usually the strongest in the
second and fourth quarters.

Learning accrues most of its net sales and results during the second
and third quarters.

Seasonal business fluctuations influence the Group’s net sales and
operating profit, with the first quarter traditionally being clearly the
smallest one for both.

Significant risks and uncertainty factors

The most significant risks and uncertainty factors Sanoma currently
faces are described in the Financial Statements and on the Group’s
website at Sanoma.com, together with the Group's main principles
of risk management. Many of the identified risks relate to changes in
customer preferences. The driving force behind these changes is the
on-going digitisation process. Sanoma takes actions in all its strategic
business units to respond to this challenge.

With regard to changing customer preferences and digitisation, new
entrants might be able to better utilise these changes and therefore
gain market share from Sanoma’s established businesses.

Normal business risks associated with the industry relate to devel-
opments in media advertising and consumer spending. Media advertis-
ing is sensitive to economic fluctuations. Therefore, general economic
conditions and economic trends in the industry influence Sanoma’s
business activities and operational performance.

Sanoma’s financial risks include interest rate and currency risks,
liquidity risk and credit risk. Other risks include risks related to equity,
impairment and the availability of capital. At the Group level, the most
significant risks relate to liquidity risk and changes in exchange rates
and interest rates.

As a result of the SBS acquisition, Sanoma’s consolidated balance
sheet includes about EUR 3.0 billion in goodwill, publishing rights
and other intangible assets. Most of this is related to magazine and TV
operations. In accordance with IFRS, instead of goodwill being amor-
tised regularly, it is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or when-
ever there is any indication of impairment. Major changes in business
fundamentals could lead to impairment.
