Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

This management report has been prepared taking into consideration the "Guide of recommendations
for the development of management reports of listed companies", published by the CNMV in July 2013.

1. COMPANY’S STANDING

The company has undergone a major transformation over the last 15 years, staying clearly ahead of the
energy transition in order to tackle the challenges posed by climate change and the need for clean
electricity.

Boasting a track record that spans over 170 years, today Iberdrola is a multinational group leading the
energy sector: the company produces and supplies electricity to some 100 million people in the countries
in which it operates. Furthermore, the company has become the leader in clean energy —Iberdrola is
the first renewable producer amongst European utilities and the cleanest power company in the USA,
with almost zero emissions—, it is pioneering the rollout of smart grids and has an energy storage
capacity in excess of 4 GW.

This is the result of the combination of its corporate vision —which in 2001 led the company to look
ahead to future trends in the sector—, the strategy followed to make this vision a reality, its successful
implementation, and the ethical values that have always guided all the group's actions. On this basis,
Iberdrola is now embarking on a new stage of growth, supported by a strong investment drive between
2016 and 2020, essentially in regulated businesses or with long-term contracts, which will provide the
security, stability and visibility that are the hallmarks of the company's business model. Likewise,
Iberdrola will continue maintaining its social commitments, acting as a driver for the growth and
generation of employment in the countries where it operates, and creating sustainable value for all its
stakeholders.

1.1 Governance system

The purpose of the IBERDROLA Group's business model is the "supply of reliable, high-quality and
environment-friendly electricity", by means of a sustainable long-term industrial project.

The model is based on three pillars: a framework of trust based on an advanced governance model; the
Mission, Vision and Values of the Iberdrola Group approved by the Board and distinguishing features
which make Iberdrola a different company.

The model is made competitive by responsible management of the Company's tangible and intangible
assets. To operate with this model, Iberdrola has defined the activities in which it wishes to be a proactive
operator, and organises its management on the basis of three global lines of business: Network
business, Generation and Sales business and Renewables business, with a Corporation as a central
organisational body for the group.

The Corporation formulates the group's strategy and supervises its fulfilment.

Mission, Vision and Values of the Iberdrola Group

The Mission, Vision and Values of the Iberdrola Group constitute its corporate philosophy, inspire and
take form in the Corporate Policies Company's By-Laws and in the other rules of the Corporate
Governance System, govern the day-to-day activities of the companies of the Group thereof, channel
its leadership role in all of its areas of activity, focus its strategy of maximising social dividends, and
guide their strategy and all of their actions. The ethical behaviour of all personnel participating in the
daily construction of the Company's corporate enterprise.

Mission

The Group’s mission is to create value sustainably in carrying out its activities for society, citizens,
customers, employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders, as the leading multinational group in the
energy sector providing a quality service through the use of environmentally-friendly energy sources,
which engages in innovation, leads the process of digital transformation in its area of activity, and is
committed to the fight against climate change through all of its business activities, with a social dividend
and the generation of employment and wealth, considering its employees to be a strategic asset. Along
these lines, we foster their development, training, and measures of reconciliation, favouring a good
working environment and equal opportunity. All of the foregoing is within the framework of our strategy
of social responsibility and compliance with tax rules. It is what modern business social responsibility
calls Shared Value, the sum of all the economic and social values that a company generates.

This mission goes hand in hand with a vision based on the ambition to lead a better future, creating
sustainable value with a top-quality service for people and communities in which the Group operates,
incorporating twelve values: the creation of sustainable value, ethical principles, good corporate
governance and transparency, development of the Group's human resources, social commitment, a
sense of belonging, safety and reliability, quality, innovation, protection of the environment, a focus on
the customer and institutional loyalty.

The Group's mission, vision and values inspire the contents of the Corporate governance system, a set
of internal regulations which, in accordance with current legislation and utilising the corporate autonomy
permitted by this legislation, furthers the Company's corporate purpose at the head of a multinational
energy leader operating across a range of social and economic contexts, satisfaction of social interests,
understood as the common interests of all the shareholders of an independent company determined to
carry out its corporate purpose in a sustainable fashion and create long-term value, with a wide-ranging
non-controlling and institutional shareholding structure.

To achieve a rules-based system ensuring that the Company's commitment to the Mission, Vision, and
Values of the Iberdrola group governs all of its activities, focused on maximising social dividends by
generating value in a sustainable manner, Iberdrola has provided itself with a Corporate Governance
System, its internal system of rules, which is configured in accordance with applicable law in the exercise
of corporate autonomy supported thereby and applies to the entire Group as a whole.

The Corporate Governance System is made up of five blocks of rules, each grouped into a book: the
By-Laws, the Mission, Vision, and Values of the Iberdrola group, the Corporate Policies, the governance
rules of the corporate decision-making bodies and other internal committees, and the other codes,
regulations, and procedures making up and elaborating upon Iberdrola’s regulatory compliance system.

1.2 IBERDROLA’s corporate governance model

Corporate governance system

Iberdrola is a leading multinational group in the energy sector which pursues the creation of value in a
sustainable way in the development of its activities for the society, citizens, customers and shareholders,
providing quality service by using energy sources that respect the environment, innovating and
considering its employees a strategic asset, committed to social return throughout its business,
generating employment and wealth in their environment and all of these, going together with its strategy
of social responsibility and compliance of tax rules.

The Corporate Governance System is made up of the Mission, Vision, and Values of the Iberdrola group,
the By-Laws, the Corporate Policies, the internal corporate governance rules, and the other internal
codes and procedures, each of them available on www.iberdrola.com.

The contents are inspired by and based on commitment to best practices in relation to good governance,
business ethics and social responsibility in all areas of its activity.

Governance model

This duly makes a distinction between the functions of strategy and supervision and those of
management and control:

¢ The Iberdrola Board, composed of a large majority of independent directors, focuses on
defining, supervising and monitoring the policies, strategies and guidelines to which the group
must adhere.

¢ The chairman of the Board, the chief executive officer and the rest of the management team
are responsible for the group's strategic coordination and organisation, through the distribution,
implementation and monitoring of the general strategy and its basic guidelines.

e — Inall countries in which the group operates, business is organised and strategically coordinated
through subholding companies, which group investments in energy business operating in the
country concerned and centralise the provision of common services to these companies. The
group also has a subholding to handle all non-energy business.

The subholdings have boards with independent directors, and their own Audit and Compliance
Committees, Internal Audit departments and Compliance units or departments.

e Parent companies are tasked with ordinary management and effective administration of all lines
of business. They also have boards with independent directors and specific management
teams.

This structure, which operates along with the group's business model, fosters global integration

of the lines of business (Networks, Generation and Sales and Renewables), and focuses on
maximising operational efficiency, by implementing best market practices.

1.3 Scope of activities, sectors and geographical areas

The IBERDROLA Group's economic-financial and operational information has been grouped in the
following lines of business: Network business, Generation and Retail businesses, Renewables
business, and other businesses. The Corporation includes the costs of the Group's structure (Single
Corporation), of the administration services of the corporate areas that are subsequently invoiced to the
other companies through specific service agreements.

Given the nature of the activities carried out by the IBERDROLA Group, its organization responds to the
strategic business units, rather than product and service lines. These businesses are managed
independently, as they respond to different technologies, regulations, and geographic markets (Note 7).

Corporate Structure

The IBERDROLA Group has a decentralised structure and management model to approximate the
decision taking to places where they should have effect, through the subholding companies and parent
companies of the businesses. In addition, the independence and listed subholding companies’
reinforced autonomy are guaranteed.

The corporate structure encompasses the Company (IBERDROLA, S.A.), subholding companies and
business parent companies.

IBERDROLA, which performs exclusively the function of the parent company, is the company
holding the stake of the subholding companies. Such entities group together equity stakes in the
energy head of business companies carrying out their activities within the various countries in which
the Group operates. This structure is rounded out with a country subholding company that groups
together certain equity interests in other entities, including the non-energy head of business
companies. One of the main functions of the subholding companies is the centralization of the
common services provided to one another, always in accordance with the provisions of the
applicable law.

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

This corporate structure has been successfully deployed in Spain, Mexico, Brazil and the UK, and
produces a rapid streamlined process for ordinary management decisions to be taken by business
parents, and introduces proper Group coordination, in exercise of the supervisory functions of
subholding companies and IBERDROLA.

In the United States of America, the Company holds a majority stake in the subholding company
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Avangrid, Inc. For this company the Corporate governance
system contemplates a special system of greater autonomy to properly protect the interests of non-
controlling shareholders, boosting vigilance of operations in connection with other Group
companies, and this gives it a greater measure of independence to coordinate its investees and
run businesses.

The Company's and the Group’s governance conforms to the structure described above: separates the
duties relating to strategy, oversight, and control of the Group as a whole, the duties of organisation and
coordination of the businesses in each country and the multinational no-energetic business, as well as
those of day-to-day administration and effective management of each business.

It is established on the following bases:

a) The Board of Directors of the Company, which exclusively exercises holding company duties,
has assigned powers relating to the establishment of the Group’s policies and strategies and of
the basic guidelines for the management thereof, as well as general oversight of the
development of such policies, strategies and guidelines and of decisions on matters that are
strategically significant at the Group level.

201 / ro) IBERDROLA

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

b) The chairman of the Board of Directors & chief executive officer of the Company, with the
technical support of the Operating Committee, the Group’s Business CEO and the rest of the
management team, assumes the duty of organisation and strategic coordination of the Group
through the dissemination, implementation and monitoring of the overall strategy and of the
basic management guidelines established by the Board of Directors.

c) This organisation and coordination duty is strengthened through the boards of directors of
country subholding companies, which includes independent directors, and their own audit
committees, internal audit areas, and compliance units or divisions.

d) The business subholding companies of the Group assume decentralised executive
responsibilities. They carry out the day-to-day administration and effective management of each
of the businesses, and are responsible for the day-to-day control thereof. These business
subholding companies are organised through their respective boards of directors and their own
decision-making bodies.

The corporate and governance structure of the Group described above operates jointly with the Group’s
Business Model, which entails the global integration of the businesses and aims to maximise the
operational efficiency of the different units. The Business Model ensures the dissemination,
implementation and monitoring of the overall strategy and of the basic management guidelines
established for each business, primarily through the exchange of best practices among the various
companies of the Group, without detracting from their independence in decision-making.

In any case, the Company and the Group assume the commitments established by law in connection
with the legal and functional separation of the companies carrying out regulated activities, while the
country subholding companies ensure compliance with the law on this matter.

1.4 Organization of the Board, or bodies in which it delegates its decision, including control
functions and the policy followed with minority interests.

A comprehensive description of the governance structure of the Company, functions and internal
regulations of the committees can be seen in Appendix C of the Annual Corporate Governance Report,
which forms part of this Management Report.

1.5 Regulatory framework of the activities

A comprehensive description of sector regulation and operation of electric and gas system in the
markets in which the Group operates can be seen in section 4 of this report.

1.6 Main products and services, production processes

The main products that IBERDROLA offers to its customers are power and natural gas, both in the
wholesale and retail markets reaching the final consumer. Also offers a wide range of products, services
and solutions in the fields of:

- — Improving the quality of life, calm and safety of the consumer.

- Efficiency and energy services.

- Caring for the environment: renewable energy and sustainable mobility.

- Power quality and safety of the facilities.

- _ Installation of electrical infrastructure.

- Global management of facilities and energy supplies.

Through its subsidiaries it also provides engineering and construction services of power generation
facilities, distribution and control; operation and maintenance of power generation facilities,
management and promotion of the ground; and sale and rental of housing, offices and commercials.
More detailed information can be found in www.iberdrola.com, in "customers" section.

As a general rule, companies directly manage the activities that belong to its core business, and
outsource other estimated to be developed more efficiently by other specialized companies, which
IBERDROLA requires certain quality standards and responsible behaviour in environmental, social and
labour fields.

This information can be extended with corresponding indicators described in the Sustainability Report.

1.7 Strategic principles for the 2016-2020 period

Market conditions

The energy scenario on which lIberdrola will be operating in the years ahead notched up considerable
progress towards a more sustainable energy model following the introduction of the Paris Climate
Change Agreement on 4 November last year, barely eleven months after it was signed. In the same
line, the European Commission ratified its target of reducing COz emissions by 40% by 2030 and its
wish for the EU to lead energy transition with its "Clean energy for all Europeans" package.

In due consideration of the technological potential of our sector to assist decarbonisation by using
renewable energies, the economy must be electrified to a greater extent in order to meet international
commitments in relation to emissions, and simultaneously to service growing world energy demand.

In this context, in the years ahead Iberdrola intends to step up its focus on the solutions energy
sustainability requires, which have already made it the "energy company of the future": more renewable
energy, more storage capacity, more networks and more smart facilities.

Iberdrola's current business model combines geographic diversification with a focus on activities linked
to the energy transition:

In the United States the company is taking up a position to home in on opportunities for
investment in energy infrastructures and renewables through the platform operated by its
subsidiary AVANGRID, which has eight regulated energy distribution companies in New York,
Connecticut, Maine and Massachusetts, and is the country's second largest wind energy
producer.

- The company will continue to expand in the United Kingdom in terms of networks and
consolidate its leadership in renewable energies, especially offshore wind power plants on the
current platform.

-  Incontinental Europe it will bolster its position in network digitalisation, and its reputation as one
of the energy companies with the fewest emissions, a leader of the renewables sector in Spain,
and a consolidated platform in Germany and France to develop new offshore wind plants.

- In Mexico, its status as the largest private electricity generator will enable it to take up the
opportunities arising from deregulation in the sector.

- In Brazil it is well placed for potential restructuring of the sector as the country's largest

distributor in terms of numbers of customers, geographic diversification (Bahia, Rio Grande do
Norte, Pernambuco and Sao Paulo states) and renewables capacity.

Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

Strategic Pillars

Iberdrola's 2016-2020 strategy will maintain a focus of currency-diversified growth, with most organic
growth opportunities concentrated in A-rating countries, to enable dividend policy to be boosted on the
strength of higher earnings, maintaining financial solvency.

Balanced growth

The strategic basis presented by IBERDROLA establishes a net investment programme of EUR 25,000
million in its main geographic and business areas with stable and predictable regulatory frameworks.

Iberdrola will allocate 42% of total investment to electricity and distribution networks. The allocation to
renewable energies and regulated generation will be the 39% and 7% of the total amount forecast,
respectively. 12% of total investment will be earmarked for generation and commercial business.

88% of the investment scheduled will target regulated business —networks, renewable energies and
long-term contracts-.

Geographically, Iberdrola will concentrate most investment in A-rating countries - 48% in Dollars, 29%
in Sterling Pounds, 20% in the Eurozone and 3% in Brazilian Reals.

Main projects

- United States: Through AVANGRID, the Group will continue to invest in network infrastructures
in the states of New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts, and hopes to add new
transmission projects to the portfolio. IBERDROLA is also building four wind power plants in the
US with a combined power output of 743 MW which jointly with two photovoltaic plants of 66 MW
results in a total of 809 MW in construction.

- United Kingdom: IBERDROLA will continue to implement network infrastructures under the
regulatory frameworks already approved for transmission and distribution (RIIO-T1 and RIIO-
ED1). With respect to renewable energy projects in the UK, and is continuing its East of Anglia
project in the North Sea which, along with the Wikinger offshore wind farm in the Baltic Sea
(Germany), will add 1,100 MW to IBERDROLA's offshore installed power output.

- Mexico: IBERDROLA's investment packages will focus on regulated generation and renewable
energies, on the strength of the energy reform introduced in this country. The Company is building
three combined-cycle plants and two cogeneration plants on long-term contracts, with a combined
power output of 2,700 MW, and has plans for further investment in renewable energies in the
years ahead.

- Spain: investment will focus on networks, where the distribution regulatory framework has been
approved up to 2019.

- Portugal: the company has begun work on construction of about 1,200 MW hydroelectric storage
facility at the Tamega River, which should be up and running by 2023.

- Brazil: IBERDROLA is building eight wind plants with a combined power output of 245 MW, and
is also involved on hydroelectric projects such as Belo Monte and Baixo Iguacu along with
NEOENERGIA. In terms of networks, tariff frameworks have been approved for ELEKTRO (up to
2019), CELPE (up to 2017), COELBA and COSERN (up to 2018).

Operating efficiency in every activity area

IBERDROLA, one of Europe's most efficient major electricity companies, will continue to boost its
operating efficiency on the strength of technical progress in terms of the automation and digitalisation
of all its businesses and processes, as well as the homogenization of processes through the
implementation of the best practices of the group in all its businesses.

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

Earnings performance

In the years ahead, efficient operation of ongoing assets, along with the aforementioned investment
plan, will lead to sustainable growth in Company earnings, with an estimated average annual increase
in gross operating profit (EBITDA) of more than 6% up to 2020, or EUR 10,000 million, with better
exposure to regulated business or long-term contracts up to 81%. The average annual increase in net
profit is expected to be around 7.5%, or EUR 3,500 million by 2020, representing an increase of two
percentage points in the net profit/EBITDA ratio to 35%.

Shareholder remuneration

The trend forecast for the period will enable the company to increase long-term remuneration for
shareholders, in keeping with results, with a payout in the region of 65-75%, which would result in a
dividend per share of EUR 0.37-0.40 in 2020. In any case, a floor of EUR 0.31 per share is established
during the period.

At the same time, IBERDROLA intends to maintain the scrip dividend formula used in recent years, and
the current number of shares - around 6,240 million - is kept steady through repurchase operations.

Financial solvency

The Company will continue to hold a solid financial position compatible with the investment plans and
the remuneration provided to shareholders.

- The average annual operating cash flow, EUR 6,900 million, will comfortably outstrip annual
average investment, which stands at EUR 4,800 million. By areas of business, cash generation
in Deregulated business and Networks will outstrip investment, while Renewables business will
be slightly down against investment.

- Maintenance of the current financial model, giving subsidiaries a capital structure which sends
out the right economic signals and is consistent with an investment-grade rating, while adhering
to current structural subordination guidelines.

- Optimisation of the liquidity position (around EUR 8,000 - 9,000 million) in current market
conditions, in order to improve the cost of borrowing, maintaining 18 months of coverage even
in stress scenarios.

2 BUSINESS EVOLUTION AND RESULTS

2.1 Operating highlights for the period

Iberdrola’s results for the period must be framed within the implementation of the corporate strategy
announced on Investor Day 2016, defined by the growing weight of regulated activities (transmission
and distribution of electricity and gas) and the renewables business, both in terms of utilising investment
opportunities and contributing to the Group’s profit, with a growing weight of the United States and
Mexico businesses on said contribution.

The results of financial year 2016 are affected by the performance of Iberdola’s reference currencies
compared to 2015. The depreciation of the Sterling Pound and the Brazilian Real has not been offset
by the US Dollar, which hardly varied compared to 2015.

In this respect, the following is remarkable:

- In Spain, the period is characterised by high renewable production (40.8% of the total) due to
the strong increase in hydroelectric production (+25.3%) especially during the first half of the
year. Demand has risen slightly compared to 2015 (+0.7%), with no variation in terms adjusted
to number of working days and temperature. The evolution of electricity consumption of the
group companies and industries shows that over the last 12 months, consumption has remained
at levels similar to 2015.

- In the United Kingdom, electricity demand dropped by 1.3% compared to 2015. However,
customers’ gas demand (not including generation consumption) increased by 2.6%.

-  Avangrid’s area of influence on the East Coast of the United States saw a 0.8% and 2.3% drop
in electricity demand and gas demand, respectively.

- On the other hand, demand in the markets of Iberdrola in Brazil grows 1% compared to the
same period of the previous year, mainly in the Northwest markets of the country covered by
Neoenergia, due to the demand of Elektro falls slightly affected by the smaller Industrial activity
in this area.

During financial year 2016, commodities international markets of raw materials evolved as follows:

- The average price of Brent oil was steady at USD 43.7 per barrel compared to USD 52.8 per
barrel last year (-16.8%).

- The average price of gas (TTF) over the period dropped to EUR 14.0/MWh, compared to EUR
19.8/MWh in 2015 (-29.3%).

- The average price of API2 coal was USD 59.8/MT, compared to USD 55.9/MT (+7.0%) last
year.

- The average cost of COz rights dropped from EUR 7.7/MT in 2015 to EUR 5.3/MT in 2016 (-
31.2%).

The average performance of Iberdrola’s main reference currencies against the Euro in 2016 compared
to last year was as follows: the Sterling Pound and the Brazilian real depreciated by 12.7% and 4.6%,
respectively, and the USD remained at levels similar to the previous FY (+0.3%).

The following highlights should be noted regarding the period analysed, in comparison to the previous
financial year:

- First full year of consolidation of UIL in the United States, an effect registered in the Networks
Business of said country.

206 / ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 12 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

Consolidated EBITDA increased by 5.5 % compared to 2015, reaching EUR 7,807.7 million.

The Net Financial Result improved by 11.7%, as a result of the financial cost drop and the
exchange rate hedges carried out at the start of the year, mainly on Sterling Pound, despite

an increase in average debt.

In this context, IBERDROLA Group’s total production in this period increased by 1.4% to 132,414 GWh

(130,594 GWh in 2015). The distribution by geographical areas is the following:

Net Production (GWh) 2016 2015 % change
Spain 61,725 54,453 13.4
United Kingdom 13,531 18,448 (26.7)
United States 17,436 17,015 2.5
Mexico 37,717 38,866 (3.0)
Brazil 639 441 44.9
Rest of the world 1,366 1,371 (0.4)
Total 132,414 130,594 1.4

At the end of 2016, IBERDROLA had 43,277 MW installed generation capacity, of which 65.5%
produces emission-free energy while operating at a very low variable cost. In the table below, distribution
classified by countries and technologies is shown:

Countries 2016 2015 MW var (16-15)

the previous fiscal year:

UIL's first full consolidation exercise in the United States, which is integrated in the Network
business in that country. The integration of Iberdrola USA and UIL, and its subsequent

incorporation into AVANGRID took place on 16 December 2015.

Reclassification results of capital grants.

Since May 2016, the capital gains attributed to results are classified as "Other operating
income" and not reducing the amortizations as previously. Correlated comparative information
for 2015 has been corrected with this effect. The increase in revenues in 2016 and 2015
amounted to EUR 82 million and EUR 91 million respectively. The effect on the Group's Net

Profit is null, since it is corrected with higher depreciation for the same amount.

2.2.1.1. Gross Margin

Gross Margin was at EUR 12,916 million with a 0.6% increase compared to what was obtained in
financial year 2015, supported by the contribution of UIL (EUR +770 million), which more than
compensates for the performance of the average reference currencies (EUR -339 million).

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

The Network business increased 11.7% compared to 2015, amounting to EUR 6,161 million, with
positive developments in Spain and the United States and reductions in the United Kingdom and Brazil.
As noteworthy events in the period we can highlight:

- In Spain, it reached EUR 2,028 million, as a result of the definitive approval of the regulatory
framework of Distribution.

- In the United Kingdom, it came to EUR 1,267 million (-13.9%), mainly due to the depreciation
of the Sterling Pound (+10%) and the revenue profile defined in the new regulatory framework
for Distribution (RIIO ED1) which came into force in April 2015.

- The contribution of the United States for the period totalled EUR 2,537 million (+49.4%) due to
the consolidation of UIL.

- Gross Margin for Brazil (Elektro) was at EUR 329 million (-16.1%) affected by the depreciation
of the Brazilian Real, a decrease in circulated energy and the different composition of the
demand with regard to last year.

- Deregulated Business

The Deregulated Business (Generation and Retail) decreased by 4.3% to EUR 4,634 million (EUR 4,841

million in 2015).

Millions of euros 2016 2015 % change
Spain and Portugal 3,071 2,971 3.4
United Kingdom 1,000 1,306 (23.4)
Mexico 509 584 (12.8)
Brazil 6 - 100.0
United States 48 (20) 340.0
Total Deregulated Business 4,634 4,841 (4.3)

- In Spain, it reached EUR 3,071 million (+3.4%) thanks to the different production mix compared
to 2015 and to the greater volume of sales to customers.

- Gross Margin for the United Kingdom was EUR 1,000 million, negatively affected by the
depreciation of the Sterling Pound, the increase of regulatory costs both in Generation and in
Retail and the lower sales as a result of warmer period.

- Mexico contributed EUR 509 million to the Gross Margin (-12.8%), due to the lower margins in
contracts with CFE as they are liked to certain macroeconomic variables (this impact is
compensated at EBITDA level as Net Operated Expenses is also linked to those variables) and
also with private customers and to the delay in putting in operation of several plants that are
already in operation.

- Renewables business

The Renewable business decreased its Gross Margin by 7.7% to EUR 2,179 million (EUR 2,361 million
in 2015).

Millions of euros 2016 2015 % change
Spain and Portugal 764 751 17
United Kingdom 385 572 (32.7)
United States 802 822 (2.4)
Brazil 36 36 -
México 69 57 21.1
Rest of the world 123 123 -
Total Renewable business 2,179 2,361 (7.7)

The main causes of this trend are:
- In Spain, it increased to EUR 764 million (+1.7%) due to greater production.

- Gross margin decline in United Kingdom, dropped by EUR 385 million, due to the effect of the
depreciation of the Sterling Pound, the lower production (-16.8%) resulting from the lower wind
power of the period, lower market prices and the LECs elimination in the third quarter of 2015.

-  Acontribution from the US of EUR 802 million (-2.4%) as a result of the non-renewable gas
business that had a positive result in 2015 due to the derivatives in electricity and gas (EUR 31
million) that has not been repeated this year. The greater production (+5.2%) offsets the drop
in the average price.

- Latin America contribute to EUR 105 million (+12.9%) with Mexico improving by 21.1% thanks
to the new capacity in operation, and Brazil was practically flat.

- Other businesses

The contribution of Other Businesses reached EUR 106 million, a decrease of 54.9% (EUR 235 million
in 2015).

2.2.1.2 Gross Operating result - EBITDA
Consolidated EBITDA increased by 5.6% to EUR 7,808 million (EUR 7,397 million in 2015), which

improved the Network business (+12.5%) and decreased Generation and Customers (-3.0%) and
Renewables (-8.9%).

Millions of euros 2016 2015 % change
Network Business 4,082 3,627 12.5
Deregulated Business 2,253 2,323 (3.0)
Renewable Business 1,500 1,647 (8.9)
Other Businesses (111) (10) (1,010.0)
Corporation and adjustments 84 (190) 144.2
EBITDA 7,808 7,397 5.6

Contribution of non-recurring elements at EBITDA level was EUR 54 million, given that the positive
impact of the Social tariff ruling (EUR +142 million) was partially offset by another set of effects (EUR -
88 million in total), which include favourable rulings in Spain, efficiency measures, extraordinary IFRS
losses in the Networks US business and the compensation to customers imposed by OFGEM.

- Net operating expenses

In addition to the above-mentioned trend of the Gross Margin, Net Operating Expenses dropped by
4.5% to EUR 3,572 million (EUR 3,739 million in 2015), impacted by the control of costs and the
incorporation of UIL.

Millions of euros 2016 2015 % change
Network Business 1,441 1,385 4.0
Deregulated Business 1,504 1,565 (3.9)

Corporation and adjustments (126) (13) (869.2)
Net operating expenses 3,572 3,739 (4.5)
- Levies

The Taxes item dropped by 9.95% to EUR 1,537 million, with the impact of the incorporation of UIL
(EUR -138 million) offset by the positive net impact of EUR 217 million related to favorable judgments
in Spain in both 2016 and 2015.

2.2.1.3. Net Operating result — EBIT

EBIT totalled EUR 4,554 million, 18.9% higher in comparison with 2015 (EUR 3,829 million).

Millions of euros 2016 2015 % change
Network Business 2,649 2,485 6.6

Other Businesses (125) (30) (316.7)
Corporation and adjustments 14 (247) 105.7
EBIT 4,554 3,829 18.9

- Amortisations and provisions
Amortisations and Provisions dropped by -8.8%, totalling EUR 3,254 million:

- The Amortisations item remained stable (+0.1%), totalling EUR 3,076 million, the lower
amortisation following the write-off in 2015 of the Longannet Plant (EUR +132 million), and the
effect of the extension to 40 years of useful life of the towers and the civil works of the onshore
wind farms in accordance with industry standards (EUR +147 million), offset the incorporation
of UIL (EUR -188 million) and the increase due to new investments.

- The Provisions item totalled EUR 178 million (-64,0%), decreasing EUR 316 million, mainly due
to the fact that in the fourth quarter of 2015 the Longannet power plant was repaired in an
amount of EUR 288 million.

2.2.1.4. Financial Result

The net financial profit/(loss) was EUR -903 million, improving by 11.7% compared to that registered in
2015 (EUR 1,023 million).

The reduction in the average cost to 3.49% (57 b.p. lower than last year) has contributed with a EUR

64.8 million (6%) on the improvement of the result associated to debt, despite the fact that average net
debt increased by EUR 2,365 million.

211 / ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 17 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

The result for DVMEs and derivatives improved by EUR 115.6 million, greatly because of the coverage
on net profit that generated a positive valuation for the evolution of Sterling Pound after Brexit.

Several non-recurring contingencies recorded in 2016 (mainly interests accrued in legal decisions and
sale of the stake in Euskaltel) resulted in a lower financial revenue of EUR 60.8 million.

2.2.1.5 Results of Companies Consolidated by the Equity Method

The Result of Companies Method of Participation reached EUR 49 million (-11.9% compared to 2015,
EUR 55 million). The improvement in Gamesa's results is offset by the lower contribution from
Neoenergia and the effect of the sale of wind farm participation in Italy.

2.2.1.6 Income from Non-Current Assets

Income from Non-Current Assets amounted to EUR 48 million with a decrease of EUR 77 million
compared to 2015 (EUR 125 million). In 2016 the most significant transactions have been the sale of
Iriquois (minority stake in a local gas network) in the United States, and the sale of the stake in the real
estate company Oceanic Center.

2.2.1.7 Net Profit

Lastly, Net Profit came to EUR 2,705 million, an increase of 11.7% compared to that obtained in 2015
(EUR 2.422 millions).

Recurring Net Profit reached EUR 2,531.7 million (EUR 2,261.4 million in 2015) (+12%) as a result of
the good performance of the business and the year-on-year comparison of specific items in each year.

The balancing of the Recurring Net Profit and the Reported Net Profit is as follows:

Millions of euros 2016 2015
Recurring Net Profit 2,531.7 2,261.4
Extraordinary writte-off 30.5 -275.5
Income from non-current assets 40.7 140.6
Non-recurring taxes 102.1 295.1
Reported Net Profit 2,705.0 2,421.6

Tax expenses increased by 71.6% to EUR 904.6 million, mainly due to non-recurring tax effects
recorded in 2015. The lower tax rate in Spain (from 28% to 25%) is offset by income in countries with
higher tax rates, such as the US.

2.3 Operative evolution of the period
2.3.1. Network business
A. Spain

IBERDROLA has approximately 10.9 million managed supply points and total distributed energy 93,736
GWh, a decrease of 0.4% compared to the same period of the previous year (94,113 GWh in 2015).

incidents that have affected 100,000 consumers in aggregate, the indicators of both companies comply
with regulatory limits.
C. United States
- Distribution
In the United States IBERDROLA has 2.2 million electricity supply points. The volume of energy
distributed in the year was 37,027 GWh, which represents an increase of 15.5% compared to

B. Offshore Wind Energy

Currently, the renewables business is developing offshore wind projects mainly in the United Kingdom,
Germany and France.

In the United Kingdom, in 2014, the Company went into operation of the West of Duddon Sands project
located in the Irish Sea with a capacity of 389 MW which is being jointly developed at 50% with Dong
Energy (194.5 MW correspond to IBERDROLA).

IBERDROLA continues the Wikinger offshore project development, up to 350 MW in the Baltic Sea
(Germany). Pilot installation and jacketing campaigns have been completed.

The cable laying works of the wind farm are also at its completion and are progressing with completion
and testing works. The OSS (marine substation) is already installed and is in the phase of completion
of the start-up and termination. At the same time, offshore turbine installation operations are underway
to start up in 2017.

Iberdrola is developing in the United Kingdom the “East Anglia” project in the North Sea. In February
2015, the East Anglia | project secured a Contract for Difference in the first auction of its kind in the
United Kingdom, for a maximum capacity of 714 MW, whose investment of GBP 2,600 million was
approved by the Company in February 2016. The project has made progress during 2016, with most of
the contracts for the supply of the main packages signed.

It is noted that the contract with Siemens for the supply of 102 wind turbines of 7 MW, contracts with
Navantia for the supply of the offshore substation and 42 jackets on which the wind turbines will be
based, the contract with Lamprell for the supply of 60 jackets and with Nexans for the supply of the
evacuation cable between the substation of the wind farm and the substation onshore. The signing with
The Crown Estate of the leasing contract of the maritime domain for the settlement of the farm during
its useful life is also remarkable in 2016.

On the other hand, Iberdrola and Vattenfall (partern in the initial development process) finalized the
negotiation with The Crown Estate in the first quarter of 2016 for the distribution of the remaining projects
in East Anglia. As a result, Iberdrola owns 100% of the rights over 3 projects in different stages of
development of accumulative capacity 2,800 MW.

In April 2012, the consortium formed by IBERDROLA and the French company EOLE-RES was
awarded by the French Government the exclusive rights for the operation of the offshore wind farm of
Saint-Brieuc, with a capacity of 500 MW. In 2013, the project was technically redefined with the aim of
using a more modern machine, 8 MW of unit power, made by ADWEN (Joint venture between Areva
and Gamesa). In October 2015, the project submitted its application for a construction license. In 2016,
the Company will work towards answering the requests from the French administration within the
process for approval of the license, as well as on the consolidation of the main supply agreements for
the future farm.

c. Other technologies

The Renewable business has facilities of other renewable technologies in various countries making a
total of 409 MW, which breakdown is presented in the following table:

4 INDUSTRY REGULATION AND FUNCTIONING OF THE ELECTRICITY AND GAS SYSTEM

Both IBERDROLA and some of the fully or proportionately consolidated subsidiaries engage in electricity
business activities in Spain and abroad (see the Appendix to these Consolidated financial statements)
that are heavily affected by the respective regulatory frameworks. Below there is a description of the
main regulations affecting the IBERDROLA Group.

41 European Union

In the member states of the European Union in which IBERDROLA is present, particularly in the UK and
Spain, it should comply with EU regulations.

The aim of the European legislation is the implementations of the single gas and electricity markets in
order to facilitate the exchange of energy flows and allow any consumer in the European Union to deal
freely with any supplier in the EU. In this respect, there are two types of legislation: the directives, which
set out common criteria to be observed in internal markets and which the member states should
transpose into national legislation; and the Regulations, which establish norms for the supranational
issues, especially those related to the transit of gas and electricity, and are applicable directly.

Another set of regulations that indirectly affects the energy sector are those arising from the energy and
climate policy agreed in 2007. It involves the triple objective of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases
(GHGs) by 20%, setting a quota of renewable energy of 20% and a target for reducing consumption by
20% vs. “Business as Usual” case, all by 2020. To meet these objectives by 2020 there have been four
documents accompanying the legislation: the reform of the Emissions Trading System, EU (EU-ETS),
the national targets for emissions from non-EU ETS, and the national objectives on renewable energy.

Since 2009, the EU institutions and Member States have worked to implement the regulation approved
in that year related to, on one hand, the internal gas and electricity markets and, on the other hand, to
promote renewable energy and to combat climate change. This regulation will be reviewed from 2016
to 2020.

The legislation on infrastructures is also relevant. The European Union has powers with regards to trans-
European networks, specifically those of energy. During the last few years, various regulations and
programmes have been created to promote a greater connectivity among the Member States.
Specifically, programmes like the Trans-European Energy Networks (TEN-E), the European Energy
Programme for Recovery (EEPR) and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Lastly, in December 2014,
the European Council approved the creation of a Strategic Investment Plan for the European Union, to
mobilize EUR 315,000 million in 2015 — 2017. It will be structured as a European Fund for Strategic
Investments allocated to investments in infrastructure, including energy and renewable energy
networks. In January 2015, the European Commission submitted the proposal of a Regulation on the
European Fund for Strategic Investments to create the required legal framework. On 27 May 2015, an
agreement was reached between the Council, the Parliament and the European Commission on the
proposed Regulation.

In October 2014, the European Council agreed new targets for 2030: a 40% reduction in GHGs
compared to 1990, a share of 27% for renewable energy and a reduction in consumption, also of 27%
(to be potentially upgraded to 30% following new proposals as explained below regarding the Clean
Energy for all Europeans package). It also agreed to ensure that in 2020 the electricity exchange
capacity among countries was at least 10% of the installed capacity.

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

On 25 February 2015, the European Commission launched a framework strategy for a resilient Energy
Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy, that includes fifteen action points to be
implemented during the mandate of the current European Commission, including, among others, setting
out the goals of an energy union and the steps the Commission will take to achieve it, a new legislation
to redesign and reform the electricity market, ensure the supply for electricity and gas, EU funding for
energy efficiency, a new renewables energy package and a structural reform of EU-ETS, facilitating the
compliance of 2030 Targets set by the European Council in October 2014. On 18 November 2015, the
European Commission presented its first State of Energy Union reporting advances achieved in 2015
and steps to be undertaken in 2016. A guidance on Governance of the Energy Union process was also
provided.

On 15 July 2015, the European Commission (EC) has published a package of documents that
anticipated legislative action in the field of energy markets and emissions trading. Through the
Communication on Market Design, the EC analysed the functioning of the EU electricity markets, arose
key proposals for improvement and opened the discussion on capacity mechanisms. The
Communication on retail market (“New Deal” for customers) made proposals to fully liberalise retail
markets and facilitate more interaction with customers. It also attached a document on “best practices”
in self-consumption.

Regarding the emissions trading, in July 2015 the EC sent its legislative proposal to reform the ETS
Directive to the European Parliament and the Council, covering, inter alia, the Market Stability Reserve
(MSR) and the protection of sectors in leak of carbon.

As set out in Decision 2015/1814 of the European Union and of the Council, the MSR (Market Stability
Reserve) will come into operation on 1 January 2019. The MSR was established to reduce 900 million
allowances of the auctioned volumes during the period 2014-2016, reintroducing them in the auctions
of 2019 and 2020. Beginning in 2019, an amount of allowances corresponding to 12 % of the number
of allowances in circulation should be deducted each year from the auction volumes and placed in the
Reserve. If the total number of allowances in the market is less than 400 million, then the MSR releases
100 million into the market.

This mechanism is intended to stabilize the EU ETS (EU Emissions Trading System) and strengthen
the carbon price signal reducing gradually the surplus allowances. The MSR is included in the EU ETS
review currently in discussion.

Discussions on the review of ETS have been held since July 2015 and overlap debate on Non-ETS
sectors (transport, buildings, agriculture, waste, land-use and forestry) since 20 July 2016, when the EC
has sent to EU legislative bodies its draft on the Effort Sharing Regulation

On 30 November 2016 the EC has published the package Clean Energy for all Europeans, containing
the legislative proposals to complete the implementation of the energy internal market and to achieve
the environmental 2030 Targets, materialising the ideas drafted in July 2015 communications.
November 2016 package involves the wholesale and retail markets and the frameworks for renewable
energy sources and energy efficiency. It assesses the implementation of capacity mechanisms fully
compatible with EU State Aid Guidelines on Energy and Environment.

The full package represents over 70 documents of which 8 are legislative proposals of high impact on

energy markets to be discussed by the European Parliament and Council over the next two years.
Practical implementation to market operation is expected to take in place by 2020.

4.2 Other EU regulation

The following regulations of significance to the energy sector were approved in 2015 and 2016:

— On 28 November, the Directive 2015/2193 on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants
into the air from medium combustion plants. This Directive establishes the mandatory register
of this units, specific limit for certain components (sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia
and volatile organic compounds) and rules to control other pollutants (carbon monoxide). The
maximum deadline of adaptation contemplated in the Directive for certain existing plants is
2030.

- In January, the OJEU published Delegated Regulation 2016/89 amending Regulation 347/2013,
concerning the Union’s list of projects of common interest. It is an update of the first list of
Projects of Common Interest of 2013. New projects are added and others disappear (basically
those for which implementation has begun). This list was published for the first time by the
European Commission on 18 November 2015, at the time of the State of the Energy Union
Report.

- Paris Agreement: On 11 April, Decision (EU) 2016/590 of the Council was published, regarding
the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Paris Agreement approved by virtue of the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The signing took place in New York
on 22 April 2016.

Following the vote of the Plenary Session of the European Parliament of 3 October backing the
decision of the Environmental Council of 30 September, the Paris Agreement adopted at COP21
was ratified. On 7 October, the Slovak Presidency submitted the instrument of ratification to the
UN. Thus, the EU can attend the summit of Marrakesh from 7 to 18 November (COP22) with
full capacity to take part in the conversations regarding the implementation of the Agreement.
Notwithstanding, the ratification should be backed by all Member States, a step that has so far
only been taken by seven countries (Hungary, France, Slovakia, Austria, Malta, Portugal and
Germany). The Paris Agreement enters into force 30 days after being ratified by 55% of
countries that make up at least 55% of emissions. Prior to this ratification, 62 countries
representing 52% of global COz2 emissions had ratified it.

- On 17 November 2016, the OJEU published the Regulation 2016/1952/EU on European
statistics on natural gas and electricity prices and it repeals the Directive 2008/92/EC. This
legislation establishes a harmonised framework to elaborate and disclose the statistics on gas
and electricity prices, both for residential customers and for companies. The new rules allow
more transparent understanding of the different price components, splitting energy, networks
and “taxes and other”. This last component reflects, inter alia the VAT, other taxes and support
to policies through customer charges, particularly the support to renewable energies.

- On 19 December 2016, the OJEU published the Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of
national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, amending Directive 2003/35/EC and
repealing Directive 2001/81/EC. This new Directive establishes stricter emission limits for each
Member State in the period 2020 — 2030 for five pulluants: sulphur dioxide (SOz), nitrogen
oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and ammonia (NHs). Levels
for 2020 are equivalent to the adopted by the UE in previous regulations but levels for 2030 are
significantly reinforced. The Directive shall be transposed to local regulation by 30 June 2018.
Each Member State shall develop a national air pollution control programme by 2019 to ensure
the compliance of the targets of this Directive regarding transport, agriculture and energy
sectors.

4.3 Industry regulation in Spain

The National Commission for Market and Competition (CNMC) is as a public body attached to the
Ministry of Energy, Tourism and Digital Agenda and is subjected to parliamentary scrutiny. It has the
functions of market regulation and supervision.

. Industry regulation and functioning of the electric system in Spain

The electric sector is regulated by the Electric Industry Law 24/2013, of 26 December 2013.
The following summarises the principles that rule Law 24/2013.
1. Activity separation

The regulation prescribes a separation between the activities carried out in the competitive sector
and others that are considered to be regulated activities. Companies that carry out any activities
defined by the law as regulated (economic and technical management of the system, transmission
and distribution) must have these as their sole corporate purpose and cannot, therefore, engage in
unregulated activities (generation, wholsesale and retail or other activities unrelated to electricity
or activities abroad). However, a group of companies can carry out incompatible activities provided
that these are performed by different companies within it and meet independence criteria. In
addition, it prescribes a separation between regulated and deregulated activities for accounting
purposes.

2. Competition in power generation activity through the following measures
- The production of electricity is developed in a free competition environment.

- Generation dispatch is determined by the daily market. The producers of electricity, except for
special cases and exception foreseen by law, tender hourly bids for the selling price of
electricity of each of the production units owned by them. The operating order of the production
units is established on the basis of the lowest bids made until demand is satisfied in each
programming period and the energy produced in each programming period is remunerated at
the price matched between supply and demand. There is also the option of going to the
intraday markets (six every day), where operators can adjust their positions with respect to
their daily programmes. Meanwhile, the production plants contribute to the provision of
whatever additional services may be necessary to guarantee supply, obtaining additional
remuneration for such services.

- In addition to the market remuneration, the Ministry of Energy, Tourism and Digital Agenda
may establish remuneration entailing payment for capacity. In this regard, Orders ITC
2794/2007, ITC 3860/2007 and ITC 3127/2011 regulate payments for capacity, which consist
of an investment incentive, an environmental incentive and an availability service. The Royal
Decree-law 13/2012 temporarily modifies the investment incentive and the environmental
incentive until a new capacity payment system is developed.

- The installation of new generating facilities is considered to be deregulated, without prejudice
to the obtainment of the necessary authorisations.

- Producers are entitled to use in their generating facilities the primary energy sources that they

deem most appropriate, subject to such restrictions with respect to the environment, as might
be stablished in the legislation in force.

Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

- On 10 June 2014, the Royal Decree 413/2014 on electricity generation by means of
renewable, cogeneration and waste facilities was published, confirming a new remuneration
scheme for those installations that are not able to achieve the minimum level necessary to
recover the costs and compete in a equiality manner with the rest of the technologies of the
market, obtaining a “reasonable rate of return”. The new specific remuneration scheme
consists of the sum of:

co “investment remuneration” (EUR/MW) to cover, where applicable, the investment costs
that cannot be recovered from the sale of electricity in market; and

co “operation remuneration” (EUR/MWh) to cover, where applicable, the difference between
the operating costs and income obtained in the electric market.

- This new specific remuneration scheme will be calculated on the basis of a standard
installation during its useful regulatory lifetime and referenced to the activity carried out by an
“efficient and well-run company” according to the following standards:

othe revenues from the sale of power;
othe operation costs needed for the activity; and
othe value of the initial investment.

This remuneration regime will be based on a reasonable rate of return of the investments, defined
on the basis of the average yield on 10 year government bonds plus a differential, initially fixed at
300 basis points for the first regulatory period ending on 31 December 2019 (that is, 7.398% before
taxes).

Six year regulatory periods and three year regulatory sub-periods have been set. The remuneration
parameters related to the market price forecasts may be changed every three years, including the
deviations produced in the sub-period. The standard parameters of the installations may be
changed every six years, except for the standard initial investment value and the regulatory lifetime,
which will remain unchanged during the installations’ regulatory lifetime. The reasonable rate of
return may be changed by law every six years, but only for remuneration in the future. The return
on operation in circumstances where the operating cost of a technology is dependent on fuel prices
may be changed at least once a year. The last Order published regarding to update this operational
costs is the Order IET/1345/2015.

The standard value of the investment for new installations will be set through a competitive
tendering process.

On the other hand, the Royal Decree 413/2014 established that an order from the Ministry of
Industry, Energy and Tourism will establish a classification of standard installations in terms of the
technology, installed capacity or any another characteristic that may be considered necessary for
the application of this remunerative scheme. Hence, on 20 June 2014, the Ministry published the
Order IET/1045/2014, of 16 June 2014 approving the remuneration parameters for standard
installations already in operation.

The Royal Decree 947/2015 stipulates a call for the granting of the specific remuneration regime
to new biomass-based electricity production plants within the peninsular power system and to wind
technology farms. A maximum of 200 MW of biomass and 500 MW of wind will be assigned (new
or repowered). The allocation procedure and the remuneration parameters are set out in the
Ministerial Order IET/2212/2015, of 23 October 2015. The auction was called by the State
Secretariat for Energy's resolution of 30 November 2015.

Said auction was held on 14 January 2016. All of the MW, both wind and biomass, were allocated,

with the peculiarity that in both technologies, the discount proved to be 100%, so that no awardee
will receive remuneration for investment costs.

To date, new auctions of renewable capacity have not yet been called, although it is expected that
in 2017 new calls may be made, with the objective of meeting the commitments of 2020.

3. Guarantee of the proper functioning of the system, by using the following measures

- Functioning of the system: Red Eléctrica de Espafia, S.A. carries on the transmission
management and system operation activities. As system operator, it is responsible for
managing the adjustment markets to guarantee a balance between energy demand and
generation.

-  Eunctioning of the market: With the creation of the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL), since
July 2006 the Portuguese and Spanish forward markets operate on an integrated way, and
since July 2007 so have the short-term daily and intra-day markets. Currently the Iberian
Market Operator (OMI) is responsible for the operation of MIBEL. OMI originated in the fusion
of OMI-Spain, responsible for the management of the daily and intra-day markets, and OMI-
Portugal, responsible for the forward market.

4. Legislation in force for regulated activities

Law 24/2013 establishes that distribution and transmission are classified as regulated
activities that are not subject to the free competition and market regime.

The Royal Decree-law 9/2013 fixes the transitory methodology that will rule the transmission
and distribution activities until the new royal decrees for these activities are approved. One
one hand, it established that, for the revenue of these activities, an “efficient and well-run
company’ will be considered applying uniform criteria throughout the Spanish territory. On the
other hand, it established that these economic regimes allow adequate revenue of a low-risk
activity. The methodology used to calculate the revenue for the distribution activity defines a
“regulatory assets base” for the activity that evolves upwards according to the investments
made and downwards according to the related depreciation, in order to fix its revenue. In the
application of these principles it established a rate of return on assets linked to government
bonds plus a spread.

Subsequently, Law 24/2013, published on 26 December 2013, introduced the following
ammendments:

- Introduction of the “efficient and well-run company” concept, considering these activities
as low risk.

- The regulatory periods extend to six years.

- For regulatory purposes, the accrual and collection of the remuneration generated by the
installations that entered into operation in the year n starts in the year n+2.

- The assets in operation not fully depreciated will receive an investment remuneration
considering their net value for the financial remuneration. The financial remuneration rate
will be based on ten year government bonds plus an appropriate spread for a low risk
activity.

On 30 December 2013 two royal decrees regulating the new remuneration methodology of the
transmission (Royal Decree 1047/2013) and distribution (Royal Decree 1048/2013) activities
were published, following the regulatory and tax measures that started in the second half of
2013.

The methodology set out in the Royal Decree 1048/2013 is based on new standard investment
and operation costs. The aim is to reduce costs by introducing efficiency mechanisms and
limitations concerning the annual investment volume. The recalculation of the base
remuneration will be carried out during its first year of implementation, which includes the initial
regulatory asset of the companies that can vary with respect to the one recognised in the Royal
Decree-law 9/2013. Investment limits are also established (sector’s maximum 0.13% of Gross
Domestic Product). The financial remuneration rate of the asset embodies the principles
established in Law 24/2013, referenced to ten year government bonds plus an appropriate
spread for a low risk activity.

The Royal Decree 1048/2013 includes changes in the existing incentives; in quality (it may
fluctuate between +2% and -3% of the company’s remuneration) and losses (it may fluctuate
between +1% and -2%). A new incentive regarding fight against fraud has been created, which
may reach 1.5% of the company’s remuneration. For the application of the new remuneration
model contained in the Royal Decree 1048/2013, its regulatory development must be
published; until then, as established in the Royal Decree 1048/2013, the remuneration scheme
of the Royal Decree-law 9/2013 will be maintained.

The remuneration system culminates with Orders IET/2659/2015 for electricity transmission
and IET/2660/2015 for electricity distribution, published on 12 December 2015, which
determine the type of installations and unit values to consider when calculating the
remuneration for 2016 onwards.

Given that the order was approved during December 2015, it was not possible to make the
remuneration calculations resulting from the application of the unit values approved in the
Order IET/2660/2015, of 11 December. For this reason, the Order IET/2735/2015, of 17
December —by which tariffs for access to electrical energy are established for 2016, and
specific standard facilities and remuneration parameters for electrical energy installations from
renewable energy, cogeneration and waste sources are approved- established an amount as
payment on account until company remuneration was established under the mentioned the
royal decree.

Lastly, the Order IET/980/2016, of 10 June, was published, by which remuneration of electrical
energy distribution companies is established for 2016. This remuneration, with the exception
of the incentive or penalisation for reduction of losses, will be definitive for the year 2016, and
will amount to EUR 5,162.6 million, of which the amount of EUR 1,655.5 million corresponds
to Iberdrola Distribucién Eléctrica.

Transmission Remuneration: That same day, the Order IET/981/2016, of 15 June, was
published, by which remuneration of companies owning electrical energy transmission
installations is established for 2016. Final remuneration for 2016 for companies that own
transmission facilities will amount to EUR 1,710 million.

5. Access tolls

Access tolls are uniform across the country and are collected by the distributors, which act as
the collector agents of the electric system.

The Royal Decree-law 14/2010, of 23 December 2010, extended the application of access tolls
to electricity producers and established that the producers would be regulated taking into
consideration the energy fed into the grid. In addition, prior to further tolls being implemented,
the Royal Decree-law 14/2010 established that an access toll of EUR 0.5 per MWh fed into
the grid will be applied to producers that are connected to the grid.

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

Subsequently, the Royal Decree 1544/2011, of 31 October 2011 implemented the
aforementioned regulation of access tolls for electricity producers.

Law 32/2014, of 22 December 2014, on metrology, modifies Law 24/2013, clarifying that the
legal authority to establish the structure and conditions applicable to the access tolls for
transmission and distribution networks corresponds to the Government.

The Order IET/2735/2015, of 17 December 2015, establishes the access tolls for 2016.

6. Progressive deregulation of electricity supply and introduction of wholesale and
retailing activity

The supply of electric power is completely deregulated and all consumers must contract their
supply of electricity with a trader. From 1 July 2009, those consumers who fulfil certain criteria
have been able to opt to contract the electricity supply with a Last Resort Trader (CUR), which
tom July 2014 became a Reference Trader (COR), with the Last Resort Rate (TUR), now the
Voluntary Price for the Small Consumer (PVPC). The TUR has been maintained for vulnerable
consumers and those who do not fulfil the requirements for the PVPC and who temporarily do
not have a current contract with a free market trader.

Law 3/2014, of 27 March 2014, obliges CORs to offer contracts in which the price of electric
power is fixed for a specific period for consumers with a right to the PVPC.

The Royal Decree 216/2014, of 28 March 2014, established the methodology for calculating
the PVPC and their legal regimen for contracting. It determines the structure of the PVPC that
will be applicable to low voltage consumers with a contracted capacity up to 10 kW. Similarly,
it determines the procedure for calculating the production cost of electric power on the basis
of the hourly price in the daily market during the billing period. In addition, as established by
Law 3/2014, it provides the option for consumers to contracting an electricity price fixed for a
year with the reference trader.

This legislation provides the Spanish electricity sector with three ways in which traders can
supply power to consumers:

- Reference supply:

o PVPC: the method that has been applied by default from 1 July 2014 if the
consumer was subject to the previous TUR.

co Annual fixed price in a regulated market offered by the reference trader.
- Contracting in the deregulated market with a reference trader.

- Last Resort Supply: a form of supply applicable to vulnerable consumers and those who
do not fulfil the requirements for the PVPC and temporarily do not have a current contract
with a free market trader.

The Resolution of 2 June 2015 of the State Secretariat for Energy, approved six procedures
necessary for billing hourly to those consumers covered by the PVPC. This resolution
establishes a period of adaptation of IT systems until 1 October 2015. From this date onwards,
all consumers having an hourly meter should be billed according to the hourly consumption
and price.

On 6 February 2016, the Supreme Court issued a judgment (dated on 3 November 2015) that
cancels the commercial fix margin used to establish the PVPC, which is the Reference
Trader’s remuneration. The Supreme Court overturns the current value of 4 EUR/kW/year with
effect from 1 April 2014 and orders the Government to set a new value after establishing a
new methodology. Until then, the current value will be used for billing as a temporary value,
as it is set out in the Order IET/2735/2015 of electric tolls for 2016.

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

On 25 November, the Royal Decree 469/2016 was published. It modified the Royal Decree
216/2014 and established the methodology of calculation of the Voluntary Price for the Small
Consumer of electric energy (this royal decree established a Reference Trader's remuneration
of EUR 4 /kW). It also established its contracting legal regime.

The methodology included the recognition of the costs to carry out the reference retail activity,
taking as reference the costs of the three most efficient reference trader and excluding the
face-to-face channel, plus a fee for the exercise of the activity (1.05% on energy price). The
reference traders must keep a cost accounting, according to criteria and rules to be determined
by Ministerial Order.

On 24 December, a Ministerial Order was published with the concrete values, both for the past
(from 1 April 2014) and the future (until 2018), establishing a fixed and variable term for the
allocation of the Reference Trader’s margin.

The reference traders will regularize the past through a customer rebilling in the 9 months after
the publication of the Ministerial Order (consumptions made from 1 April 2014 to the
publication of the order). In the billings made by each reference traders prior to that date, the
value of EUR 4 per kW and year established in Royal Decree 216/2014, (annulled by the
Supreme Court rulings), will continue to be applied on a transitional basis.

7. Price formation and tariff structure

Law 24/2013 regulates the aspects relating to the PVPCs, which are defined as the maximum
prices that the suppliers that assume the reference supply obligations will be able to charge.

They will be calculated as the sum of the following items:

- the production cost of electricity, based on market mechanisms, taking account of the
average price set in the production market during the billing period;

- the corresponding access tolls and fees; and
- the corresponding supply costs.

8. Social tariff

The Royal Decree-law 9/2013 sets out the social tariff for consumers with certain social,
consumption and purchase power characteristics supplied at the TUR at their normal
residence, and the financing of the social tariff costs. This tariff is calculated as 25% of the
PVPC. Until the social and economic indicators are developed for application, the social tariff
will apply to individuals in their normal residence supplied under the last resort scheme with
contracted capacity of less than 3 kW, to large families or families whose members are all
unemployed and to certain pensioners 60 years old or older receiving minimum pensions.

Such costs shall be borne by the parent company of the vertically integrated companies. The
allocation of the social tariff costs among such companies will be made according to the
number of supplies connected to the distribution network and the number of customers of the
retail business of the group.

In the Royal Decree 968/2014, of 21 November 2014, the methodology for fixing the
distribution percentage of the amounts to be financed with regard to the social tariff is
developed. These percentages will be calculated annually by the CNMC for each business
group, as the relation between (i) the sum of the annual averages of the number of feeds
connected to the distribution networks of the distributors and of the number of customers of
the distributors in which the group participates, and (ii) the sum of all the annual average values
of feeds and customers of all the business groups that should be considered for the effects of
this sharing.

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

On 20 October 2015, the Ministry published the Order IET/2182/2015, of 15 October, which
set the percentage of the amounts to be financed with regard to the social tariff for 2015.
According to this order, Iberdrola should finance 38.26%.

On 10 September, the Order/IET/1451/2016 was published. This order establishes the
distribution percentages of the amounts to be financed regarding the Social tariff
corresponding to 2016. This order assigns a 37.951119% to Iberdrola Espafia, S.A.U., to be
applied as from settlement number 8 of the Social tariff (August). Up until the publication of
the order a provisional percentage of 37.97% was applied.

On 30 November, the judgments of the appeals filed by the companies Viesgo, Endesa,
Iberdrola and Gas Natural against the Royal Decree 968/2014 were published. This Royal
Decree developed the methodology for setting the percentages of Social tariff’s finance. In the
aforementioned judgments, the Supreme Court recognizes the claim of the companies and
annuls the system of financing the Social tariff as discriminatory. The financing companies
must be compensated for the amounts contributed in 2015 and 2016 (affected by the annulled
articles of RD 2014), with their corresponding interests. As a result, the last settlement of Social
tariff made in 2016, (up to the closing date of the year), was the settlement 8 for the period
January — August.

Subsequently, on 24 December, the Royal Decree-law 7/2016 was published, which regulates
the mechanism for financing the cost of Social tariff and other measures to protect vulnerable
electricity consumers. This royal decree-law establishes a new mechanism for financing the
Social tariff, charging to the commercialization activity, with immediate entry into force. Until
the regulatory development, the trading companies of Iberdrola would finance 35.5% up from
37.97% attributed to the Iberdrola Group in the previous system.

In addition, it creates a second group of "severe vulnerable consumers" who must not have
their supply interrumpted, as well as co-financing their invoices by the “competent
Administrations” and by the same Social tariff funders. This measure must be developed by
regulation in 3 months.

9. Load Manager

The Royal Decree-law 6/2010 introduced the load manager as another agent in the electrical
system.

The Royal Decree 647/2011, which was approved in May 2011, regulates the functions of load
managers, defined as “companies that, as consumers, are authorised to resell electricity for
power recharging services. Load managers are the only subjects with wholesale customer
character under the terms provided for the applicable community regulations.” The Royal
Decree 647/2011 sets forth the requirements and obligations of load managers. It also created
a new super off-peak tariff applicable to contracts of up to 15 kW, thereby creating a third hour
period (from 1 a.m. to 7 a.m.) aimed at encouraging the charging of electric vehicles in this
period.

10. Emission allowances

Regarding environment regulations, the issue of CO2 emissions allowances is critical. This
concerns the obligation placed on industry and electricity companies by Directive 2003/87/CE
to deliver an emission allowance for each ton of COz emitted by a plant, and the cap is reduced
over time so that total emissions fall. In 2020, emissions from sectors covered by the EU ETS
will be 21% lower than in 2005.

231 / ro) IBERDROLA

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

In 2009, within the European Union’s Green Package for energy and climate change, Directive
29/2009/CE was approved, introducing changes and extending the European Union emissions
trading system beyond 2012. Phase 3 (2013-20), significantly different from previous phases,
is based on rules which are far more harmonised than before. The main changes in the
directive were: the default method of allocating allowances is auctioning, not free allocation,
although transitional free allocation is envisaged in some cases; extension of the periods of
compliance to be followed by consecutive periods in which the amount of rights is determined
on an European Union-wide scale; it also provides that allowances can be carried over one
period to the next. As a result of the new rules, since 2013, IBERDROLA has no longer had
the right to receive any free allocation.

The auctioning of allowances is governed by the EU ETS auctioning Regulation. This covers
the timing, administration and other aspects of auctioning to ensure it is conducted in an open,
transparent, harmonised and non-discriminatory manner. Two auction platforms are in place:
European Energy Exchange (EEX) (common platform for the large majority of countries
participating in the EU ETS) and Futures Europe (ICE) (acts as the United Kingdom’s
platform). The Member States’ shares in the auctioning volume in 2013 to 2020 are distributed
as follows: (i) 88% on the basis of their share of verified emissions in 2005 or the average of
the 2005-2007 period, (ii) 10% are allocated to the least wealthy EU member states as an
additional source of revenue to help them invest in reducing the carbon intensity of their
economies and adapt to climate change, and (iii) the remaining 2% is given as a ‘Kyoto bonus’
to nine EU Member States, which by 2005 had reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by at
least 20% of levels in their Kyoto Protocol base year.

A surplus of emission allowances has built up in the ETS since 2009, largely due to the
economic crisis (which has reduced emissions more than anticipated) and high imports of
international credits. This has led to lower carbon prices and thus a weaker incentive to reduce
emissions. The European Commission (EC) is addressing this through short- and long-term
measures. As a short-term measure the European Commission postponed in February 2014
the auctioning of 900 million allowances until 2019-2020 (“backloading”).

As a long-term solution, changes will be introduced to reform the ETS by establishing an MSR
as of 2018, operating from 1 January 2019. The reserve will address the current surplus of
allowances and improve the system’s resilience to major shocks by adjusting the supply of
allowances to be auctioned. It will operate entirely according to pre-defined rules. The
‘backloading’ was also amended by MSR Decision, passed in October 2015: backloaded
allowances will not return to the market in 2019-20, instead they will be introduced in MSR.

11. Toll balance

Electricity Industry Law 54/1997, of 27 November, introduced the liberalisation of electricity
generation and retailing activities. The difference between the access toll revenue established
by the Government and real costs related to these tolls resulted in a revenue shortfall which
led to problems and modifications in the functioning of the system.

To fund this shortfall, which is deferred through the recognition of long-term collection rights
recovered by the annuities incorporated in annual fees, a series of measures have been
adopted.

The first measure was the Royal Decree-law 6/2009, of 30 April 2009, that set limits to the
increase of the shortfall and defined a framework for the gradual sufficiency of the access tolls.
It also addressed the mechanism for funding the toll shortfall through a securitisation fund set
up for this purpose: Electricity system deficit securitisation fund (FADE).

232 / ro) IBERDROLA

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

As measures adopted since 2009 proved to be insufficient throughout 2013, the Government
carried out a process of regulatory and tax reform for the electricity sector. As a step prior to
this reform, the Law 15/2012 established new tax measures and the Royal Decree-law 9/2013,
was approved, adopting urgent measures to guarantee the financial stability of the electric
system and modified the methodology for the calculation of the remuneration of the
transmission and distribution activities, special regime and capacity payments, among other
measures.

Finally, Law 24/2013 is governed by the principle of economic and financial sustainability of
the electricity system, meaning that any regulatory measure which causes an increase in costs
or a reduction in income for the electricity system should incorporate an equivalent reduction
of other cost items or an equivalent increase in income that ensures the equilibrium of the
system. Thus, the possibility of new deficits accumulating, as have occurred in the past, is
ruled out.

This principle is reinforced with the obligation to automatically review the tolls and fees if the
temporary imbalances between revenues and costs of the electricity system exceed the
following limits from 2014 onwards:

- 2% of the income estimated for the system in a given year.

- The accumulated debt due to imbalances in preceding periods may not exceed 5% of the
income estimated for the system in a given year.

The part of the imbalance that, without exceeding such limits, is not compensated by increases
in tolls and fees will be financed by the parties to the settlement system in proportion to the
remuneration that corresponds to them for their activities.

The amounts thus contributed will be returned in the corresponding settlements during the
following five years together with an interest rate equivalent to the market rate.

In contrast to the previous system, these imbalances will not be financed exclusively by large
companies and the collection rights corresponding to income deficits may not be assigned to
the Securitisation Fund of the electricity system debt after 1 January 2013.

With regard to the excess income that could arise, it will be used to compensate imbalances
from previous years and, as long as there are debts pending from previous years, the access
tolls and fees may not be revised downward.

The Royal Decree 680/2014, of 1 August, regulates the procedure of budgeting, recognition,
settlement and control of the surcharges on the production of electric power in the isolated
electricity systems of the non-peninsular territories charged to the Central State Budgets, thus
developing the provisions of Law 24/2013, which established that from 1 January 2014, 50%
of these surcharges would be financed against the Central State Budgets.

At the end all these measures have enabled the final statements of 2014 and 2015 to be
closed with a surplus of EUR 550.3 million and EUR 469.3 million respectively. This surplus
will not be used as an income in the regulated settlement of the current financial year.

12. Self-consumption

Self-consumption is regulated for the first time in the Law 24/2013 and defined as the electric
energy provided by generation installations associated with a consumer. Self-consumers must
pay the same access toll for the consumed energy as other customers (from the network or
from your own installation). In addition, a mandatory register for self-consumption installations
is created.

233 | ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 39 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

Later, the Royal Decree-law 9/2015 of 10 July modified Law 24/2013 to establish the possibility
of setting reductions in tolls, fees and costs for certain categories of consumers for which the
maximum contracted power consumption and generation installed shall not exceed 10 kW.
This measure is exceptionally and it will be implemented as long as the safety and economic
and financial sustainability of the system is ensured.

Finally, the Royal Decree 900/2015 of 10 October regulated the administrative, technical and
financial conditions of the self-consumption modalities. It differentiated between two types of
self-consumption:

- Supply with self-consumption: a consumer in a single electricity supply point or installation,
with an internal network of one or more installations to generate electricity for self-
consumption, which were not registered as generation facilities. In this case, the consumer
is a single subject. The contracted power shall not exceed 100 kW and discharges of
energy to the grid do not receive monetary compensation.

- Production with self-consumption: a consumer in an electricity supply point or installation
associated with one or several production facilities duly registered in the administrative
record of energy production facilities. In this case there are two subjects - the consumer
and the producer.

Regarding the economic regime, and until charges associated with system costs are
approved, the self-consumer must pay a fixed charge and a variable charge applicable to the
self-consumed energy. However, those consumers who fall into the supply with self-
consumption modality and have contracted power less than or equal to 10 kW will be exempt
from the temporary charge for the self-consumed energy, the insulated electrical systems
(Canarian Island, Ceuta, Melilla, Ibiza and Formentera), and cogeneration until 31 December
2019. Self-consumers also pay network tolls for the use of the network, like other consumers.

13. Interruptibility

The interruptibility service for a consumer consists in the reduction of its contracted capacity
in response to a reduction order from the system operator. This order will be given taking
account of the needs that arise in the operation of the electricity system, according to criteria
of security and lowest cost.

The system operator will request the execution of the capacity reduction option, following
economic and technical criteria:

- Economic criteria: In situations where the application of the service has a lower cost than
that of the adjustment services of the system.

- Technical criteria: As a rapid response mechanism in emergency situations in the
operation of the system.

To execute the option, the system operator will send a power reduction order to the service
providers who will reduce their active power demanded until the committed residual power
values are fulfilled.

The allocation of the interruptibility service will be carried out through an auction procedure
managed by the system operator, as established in the Order IET/2013/2013, guaranteeing
the effective provision of the service and its execution at the lowest cost for the electricity
system.

234 | ro) IBERDROLA

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

Finally, the resolution published on 12 August 2016 approves the rules of the competitive
procedure of auctions for the allocation of the service of interruptibility. It also approves the
model of adhesion to the legal framework (established for participation in the auctions). On 12
October was published the resolution approving the calendar and characteristics for the 2017
electric season of the competitive auction procedure. These auctions took place during the
week of 14 to 18 November. The total cost amounted to EUR 524.8 million with a total allocated
power of 2,975 MW and an average price of EUR 176,420 / MW.

Relating to the interrupbility, a resolution has been published which sets the average price of
energy to be applied in the calculation of the remuneration of the service of interruptibility
offered by consumers of non-mainland electric systems to which it is applicable Order
ITC/2370/2007, of 26 July, during the foruth quarter of 2016. Its value is fixed at EUR 42.40 /
MWh.

14. Energy efficiency

Energy efficiency is an essential aspect of the European 2020 strategy for sustainable growth
and one of the most effective forms of strengthening the security of energy supply and reducing
emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. In this sense, the European Union has
set itself the target of achieving a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020.

Law 18/2014, of 15 October, approving measures for growth, competitiveness and efficiency,
contains a set of mechanisms designed to achieve the energy saving targets established in
the Energy Efficiency Directive. To this end, it created the National Energy Efficiency Fund,
managed by the Institute for the Diversification and Saving of Energy (Instituto para la
Diversificacién y Ahorro de la Energia) and financed by an annual contribution from all
suppliers of gas and electricity, wholesalers of oil products and of liquid petroleum gases,
according to their sales. The Order IET/289/2015, of 20 February, established the contribution
obligations for 2015.

Law 8/2015, of 21 May, modified Law 18/2014 and established that the obliged entities must
make an annual contribution from 2016 onwards to the National Energy Efficiency Fund in four
instalments: on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December of each year. In addition,
in order to establish the annual contribution for each obliged entity, positive or negative
adjustments can be made, resulting from data provided by the obliged entities, such as sales
and other variables, and data set out by the relevant ministerial order of the previous year.

Finally, the Order IET/359/2016 of 17 March established the contribution obligations for 2016.
e Industry regulation and functioning of the gas system in Spain

The natural gas sector in Spain has undergone significant changes in its structure and operation in the
last ten years, from a monopoly to a fully open market, driven mainly by the deregulation measures
about natural gas intern market in European directives (2009/73/EC Directive is currently in force) aimed
at opening up markets and creating a single European gas market.

These liberalised principles have been incorporated and developed in Spanish law through the
Hydrocarbon Industry Law 34/1998, which began the deregulation process and, more recently, through
the Law 12/2007 and the Royal Decree-law 13/2012 which completed this process.

The Hydrocarbon Industry Law of 1998 laid the foundations for the new gas system, particularly with
regard to the separation of activities (regulated and deregulated), the introduction of third-party access
to the regulated network, the abolition of the former concessions for piped gas supply and their
conversion into regulated administrative permits, and the establishment of a timetable for progressive
market deregulation.

235 / ro) IBERDROLA

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

In line with these principles, the gas system has been structured around two types of activities: regulated
activities (regasification, basic storage, transmission and distribution) and deregulated activities (trading
and supply).

The Hydrocarbon Industry Law 34/1998 provided for the legal separation of deregulated and regulated
activities and the segregation for accounting purposes of the various regulated activities. In addition,
with the publication of Law 12/2007, Spain moved a step closer to achieving functional separation
between network activities and deregulated activities and between network activities and technical
system management. In 2012, the Royal Decree-law 13/2012 was approved, transposing Directive
2009/73/EC, and establishing further measures of separation in management of the transmission
network.

Although the Hydrocarbon Industry Law established the general principles of the new Spanish gas
system, the sector’s deregulation did not come into practice until 2001, after the publication of the Royal
Decree-law 6/2000, on urgent measures to intensify competition in the goods and services markets, and
the Royal Decree 949/2001, regulating third party access to gas installations and establishing an
integrated economic system for the natural gas sector.

The first of these decrees enacted certain elements of the Hydrocarbon Industry Law with the aim of
ostering measures that would facilitate the elimination of entry barriers for new supply companies. In
particular, it created the technical system manager (ENAGAS, S.A.), provided for a 25% gas release
under the contract for natural gas brought from Algeria through the Maghreb pipeline, and brought
‘orward the timetable for deregulation.

The second, the Royal Decree 949/2001, established firstly the specific terms and conditions for third-
party network access and, a remuneration system for regulated activities and a cost-based system of
tariffs, tolls and fees structured according to pressure levels and consumption bands.

The remuneration assigned to each company as well as the tariffs, tolls and fees are updated
periodically by ministerial orders and resolutions.

The economic system also established a settlement procedure that would allow for redistribution of
revenues collected in the form of tariffs, tolls and fees between the various regulated activities in
accordance with the remuneration method established. The body responsible for effecting this
redistribution is the Ministry of Energy, Tourism and Digital Agenda.

Other issues related to the regulation of the transmission, distribution and supply businesses, the
administrative authorisation procedures for natural gas facilities and the regulation of certain aspects of
the supply business are dealt with in the Royal Decree 1434/2002.

As for the technical operation of the system, the operating regulations are established in the Order ITC
3126/2005 enacting the gas system technical management rules. Inter alia, these regulations
established that each operator is individually responsible for maintaining its liquidity and enacts specific
protocols for the conduct of the technical system manager in exceptional operating circumstances.

Despite the sector's progressive deregulation, prevailing regulation upholds the state’s obligation to
ensure the safety and continuity of supply. To this end, the Royal Decree 1766/2007 stipulates that
direct market suppliers and consumers must maintain minimum security stocks equivalent to 20 days’
consumption. In addition, it limits the maximum percentage of gas supplies that may be sourced from a
single country to 50%.

The state also maintains responsibility for obligatory planning work for certain infrastructures (for
example, gas pipelines forming the core transmission network, the secondary transmission network,
determining the total liquid natural gas regasification capacity necessary to supply the system and core
natural gas storage facilities). For all other infrastructures, the state’s planning work is indicative only.
In 2012, the Royal Decree-law 13/2012 enacted a series of measures to halt the construction of new
infrastructure in a context of falling demand for gas.

As mentioned above, in Spain the deregulation process was completed with Law 12/2007 transposing
Directive 2003/55/CE. The two key changes enacted by this law were the elimination of regulated supply
and the functional separation between network activities and deregulated activities.

In the Spanish electric system, the market deregulation process was completed on 1 July 2008 with the
elimination of regulated supply for customers and the creation of last-resort supply. Currently, low-
pressure customers with annual consumption of less than 50,000 kWh who do not choose another
supply option shall be supplied by a last-resort supplier at a price calculated automatically. This
additional rate is called the last resort tariff.

Law 18/2014, on measures for growth, competitiveness and efficiency, previously the Royal Decree-law
8/2014 established the principle of economic and financial sustainability for the gas system. This
principle is reinforced with the obligation to automatically review tolls and fees if the annual imbalance
between revenues and costs of the gas system exceeds the following limits:

— 10% of the income receivable for the year; or

- 15% of the sum of the annual imbalance plus annual payments recognised and pending
amortisation.

The part of the imbalance that, without exceeding the above limits, is not compensated by the increase
in tolls and fees, will be financed by the parties to the settlement system in proportion to their
remuneration. The amounts contributed will be returned in the following five years and will earn an
interest rate equivalent to the market rate.

The deficit accumulated as at 31 December 2014 will be financed by the owners of the installations
during a period of 15 years.

On the other hand, the remuneration of the regulated activities will be based on the costs necessary for
an efficient and well-managed company to carry out the relevant activity, following the principle of
performing the relevant activity at the lowest cost for the gas system. In addition, the remuneration of
regulated activities will be on the basis of six-year regulatory periods. The first regulatory period ends
on 31 December 2020.

The remuneration system for distribution is based on the remuneration of the previous year, adjusted
for changes in productivity and new customers.

The remuneration system for transmission, storage facilities and regasification is based on the net value
of the associated assets. In addition, the associated operating and maintenance costs and premiums
for continuity of service are also factored in to calculate the remuneration system.
The Hydrocarbon Industry Law has been modified by Law 8/2015, 21 May 2015.
The main aspects introduced by Law 8/2015 regarding the gas system are:

— The creation of an organised wholesale gas market.

— The designation of the operator of the regulated gas market.

— Some measures relating to minimum security stock levels are adopted.

- CORES (Corporacién de Reservas Estratégicas de Productos Petroliferos) is enabled to
constitute, maintain or manage natural gas and liquefied natural gas strategic stocks.

— With respect to the Efficiency Fund (Fondo Nacional de Eficiencia Energética) the law permits the
refund of contributions when necessary (in case of mistake, for example).

- A new fiscal regime is established, benefiting the landowners and regions (Comunidades
Auténomas) where the activities of exploration, investigation and production with conventional and
non-conventional (including fracking) techniques are developed.

— Inspections may be carried out by any natural gas installation company (not only distribution
companies).

Finally, the Royal Decree 984/2015 of 30 October 2015 regulated the organised wholesale gas market
and the third party access to the facilities of the natural gas system. This market will initially include the
negotiation of short-term standardised products by an electronic platform managed by the Market
Operator (MIBGAS - OMEL). In addition, this market will centralise the hiring capacity through an
electronic platform managed by the Technical System Operator (ENAGAS), with standardised products
and auction procedures.

e Alternative energies for transport

The Royal Decree 639/2016, of 9 December, establishes a framework of measures for the
implementation of an infrastructure for alternative fuels. This is the transposition of the Directive, which
requires each State to set specific objectives and measures to foster infrastructures that allow the
deployment of alternative mobility to oil. It contemplates the use of electricity for transportation by road
and the supply in ports and airports. It also contemplates the use of natural gas (CNG or LNG) in
transport by road or ports.

4.4 Industry regulation in the UK

The principal laws that govern Scottish Power Ltd.'s (hereinafter, SCOTTISH POWER) activities are the
Electricity Act 1989 (Electricity Act) and the Gas Act 1986 (Gas Act), as substantially amended and
supplemented by numerous subsequent enactments, including the Gas Act 1995, the Utilities Act 2000,
the Energy Act 2004, the Energy Act 2008, the Energy Act 2010, the Energy Act 2011, the Energy Act
2013, the Energy Act 2016 and various EU Directives (subject to any changes arising from the UK’s
forthcoming exit from the EU). These specific energy laws are implemented by UK and EU legislation
relating to competition and consumer protection.

1. The Regulatory Authorities

The principal regulatory authority for utilities is the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (GEMA),
comprising a chairman and other members appointed by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy
and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). GEMA is supported by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets
(OFGEM). The main instrument of regulation used by GEMA is the licensing regime which in most cases
requires the various aspects of the energy industry to be carried out under a licence to which standard
conditions apply. In addition, there are a number of statutory obligations, known as relevant
requirements, which are enforced by GEMA as if they were licence conditions.

GEMA's principal objective is to promote the interests of present and future consumers and promote
effective competition. Under the Energy Act 2010, the interests of such consumers must be taken as a
whole, including their interests in the reduction of greenhouse gases and in the security of the supply of
gas and electricity to them.

In furthering this objective GEMA must ensure that all reasonable demands for electricity and gas are
met, ensure that licence holders are able to finance the activities they are obliged to undertake, and
contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. Further provisions concerning the duties of
GEMA have been made by the Energy Act 2013, but the provisions in question are yet to be
implemented.

238 / ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 44 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

GEMA's functions include the granting of licences (and their revocation in certain limited circumstances),
the making of changes to licence conditions (including the operation of price controls for the monopoly
network functions), the review of industry code modifications, operating schemes for promoting
renewable electricity and energy efficiency, and the enforcement of the industry's obligations.

GEMA has the power to impose monetary penalties for past and ongoing breaches of licence conditions
and relevant requirements and it can order that redress is provided to consumers. Fines and redress
orders for a particular breach can in aggregate be up to 10% of the licensee’s applicable turnover.

The principal Regulatory Authority for competition matters is the Competition and Markets Authority
(CMA). They can undertake general market investigations and, working concurrently with GEMA, can
investigate potential breaches of competition law in the utility field. Consumer protection matters are
enforced by the CMA, OFGEM and Local Authority Trading Standards departments.

2. Licences

Companies within the SCOTTISH POWER Group hold licences for various functions including:

the supply of electricity;
- the generation of electricity;

- the distribution of electricity in the South Scotland area, in the Merseyside and North of Wales
area;

- the supply of gas;

- the shipping of gas (that is, arranging for the insertion, the transmission, and the removal of it
from the public network); and

- the transportation of gas to certain specific sites (such as proposed new gas fired power
stations).

The third package of European Union Directives on Electricity (2009/72/EC) established additional
restrictions to the ownership of transmission companies. On 19 June 2012, Scottish Power Transmission
Limited (SPTL) was certified by OFGEM, in accordance with the Directive's Article 9, with the European
Commission approval, on the basis that SPTL's arrangements guarantee more efficient independence
than the ITO provisions under the Directive's Chapter V. As a result, the provisions relating ownership
separation do not apply to SPTL.

The conditions of licences regulate such matters as:

- for network licences: the quality of service and the charges that can be made.

- for supply to domestic consumers: consumer protection provisions including rules on standards
of conduct, provision of information, debt and disconnection, cost reflective pricing, in relation
to payment methods, information supply to customers and on treating customers fairly.

- for most types of licence: rules requiring adherence to industry codes that set down the detailed

technical rules for operating the industry, and providing for OFGEM to determine whether
proposed changes to the codes should go ahead.

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

The Gas Act 1995 and Utilities Act 2000 introduced standard licence conditions to ensure that all holders
of a particular licence type are subject to the same conditions. Under the Electricity and Gas Regulations
2011 (Internal Markets), modifications of individual or standard licencing terms no longer require the
holders’ consent. However, affected licence holders and other parties can appeal to the CMA on both
procedure and substance, except where legislation allows the Secretary of State to modify licence
conditions for certain specified purposes (typically the delivery of industry wide reforms). In most cases,
these powers are time limited. Changes to licence conditions can also currently be made without the
right of appeal in pursuance of a European Union obligation, using powers in the European Communities
Act 1972. A market investigation was initiated on 26 June 2014 by GEMA. The investigation was into
the operation of retail gas and electricity markets for domestic and small business consumers, and the
wholesale markets that support such supply. In June 2016, the CMA published its Final Report which
set out the findings from its investigation and its decision on remedies. The report concluded that
competition in the wholesale gas and electricity markets works well and that the presence of vertically
integrated firms does not have a detrimental impact on competition. No strong case was found for
returning to the old “pool” system for the Wholesale Electric Market.

However, a number of adverse effects on competition were identified in the retail market, some due to
ill-conceived regulation, but mainly focussed on the ‘weak customer response’ from the ~70% of
customers who are on standard variable tariffs (SVT) and who lose out through lack of engagement in
the market. Most of the CMA’s remedies are focussed on increasing competition in the SVT segment,
including creating a database of disengaged customers (those who have been in tehe SVT for more
than 3 years) which could be used by rival suppliers for marketing, and a programme of trials to develop
more effective customer prompts. However, in the case of customers with prepayment meters the CMA
decided to impose a transitional safeguard tariff cap, to be set above the “efficient” level of pricing, with
the aim of mitigating the damage to competition that might otherwise arise. Other remedies include
location-dependent charging for transmission losses, changes to industry settlement processes and
code governance, and recommendations to the Government on a number of subjects including GEMA’s
duties.

The CMA made a number of orders in December 2016 to implement relevant remedies, ahead of its
statutory deadline of 23 December to complete implementation. It will remain involved to monitor the
implementation and effectiveness of remedies.

3. EU Regulation on Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT)

GEMA also enforces REMIT in the United Kingdom. It has the power to levy unlimited fines for breaches
and since 13 April 2015 can initiate criminal prosecutions for breach of the market manipulation element
of REMIT against both companies and the individual employees involved. In the case of individuals, the
penalty can include imprisonment for up to two years.

4. Price controls

Prices for the sale of electricity and gas by utilities to final consumers are not currently controlled in the
United Kingdom but as a result of a remedy imposed by the CMA, prices for supply to customers with
prepayment meters will be subject to a transitional safeguard cap between 1 April 2017 and 31
December 2020. Although there is no controlled tariff for consumers with specific characteristics, all the
major suppliers must offer special discounts for certain disadvantaged customers under the Warm
Homes Discount programme. The total cost of discounts of the Warm Home Discount programme for
SCOTTISH POWER in 2015-2016 was about GBP 6.40 per customer (counting gas and electricity
separately) and, like any other costs, suppliers are free to pass on the cost to their tariffs. OFGEM has
implemented licence modifications requiring any price variation by payment method to be cost reflective.

Similarly, there are currently no controls other than those established in the Competition Act 1998 and

the Transmission Constraint Licence Condition (TCLC), on prices charged to commercial customers or
on other prices in the wholesale electricity and gas markets.

240 / ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 46 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

TCLC prohibits electricity generators from making excessive profits resulting from actions in balance
markets. OFGEM has published guidelines on the interpretation and application of the TCLC.
Enforcement decisions under the framework of the TCLC are subject to review by the Competition
Appeal Tribunal, rather than the review by the courts applicable to other GEMA enforcement decisions.
The condition expires five years after its enactment, having been implemented on 29 October 2012, and
is renewable for another two years. OFGEM consulted in April 2016 on renewing TCLC, but no decision
has been announced at this stage.

OFGEM has implemented electricity market liquidity obligations for large integrated retail and generation
businesses, including SCOTTISH POWER. These include obligations to facilitate trading with smaller
companies and also an obligation to create market in a number of wholesale products during two
specified “windows” in each business day. Although the prices of bids and offers are not regulated, the
licence condition limits the spread between them. There are rules designed to give some protection to
obligated licensees in fast or volatile markets. To date, we have incurred some limited costs in complying
with this obligation.

Following its Retail Market Review (RMR), OFGEM has imposed in 2013 a number of rules restricting
the products that could be sold in the domestic energy market including restrictions on the number and
composition of tariffs. Following a recommendation from CMA these restrictions were removed in 2016.
Other RMR remedies including information requirements, requirements for notifying customers of lower
tariffs and standards of conduct for customer treatment remain in place.

The networks are considered to be a natural monopoly. Therefore, their revenues have been controlled
and this is now achieved through the new RIIO framework (Revenues = Incentives + Innovation +
Outputs). This involves setting a revenue profile for an eight year period (with a limited revision every
four years) based on the regulator's assessment of the costs of an efficient network operator and the
likely capital programme (based on a business plan submitted by the Company) in order to calculate the
revenue needed to meet a target return on investments. The formula uses a Market Indicator for setting
the debt cost, and phases in (for electricity) an asset depreciation period of 45 years, replacing the 20
year period used previously. Various incentives have been added to the formula which also takes
account of inflation in order to calculate the permissible revenues for the network.

Under the RIIO framework, there is a greater emphasis on outputs and innovation, as well as on the
role that network companies can play in developing a sustainable energy sector.

In the transmission business, SPTL’s new RIIO T1 framework became effective in April 2013. In
distribution, the new RIIO-ED1 for the Scottish Power network in the South of Scotland and in the
Manweb area came into force on 1 April 2015. Following an appeal made to the CMA by British Gas
Trading Ltd, a small adjustment was made, which affected the prices set for 2016/17 and later years.
The net effect on Scottish Power's distribution licenses is a revenue reduction of GBP 19 million over
the 8 years RIIO ED1 period.

OFGEM has brought forward proposals for competitively tendering the construction of large, new and

separable transmission projects. This may lead to a few transmission developments being taken forward
by others.

5. Other issues
Other key elements of the regulatory regime in the United Kingdom include:

The Renewables Obligation (RO)

For some time, the United Kingdom Government has intended to source at least 30% of electricity from
renewable sources by 2020 as part of its commitment to meeting its obligations under the EU
Renewables Directive. To this end, the RO Orders (which apply separately to different parts of the United
Kingdom within a unified scheme) place obligations on suppliers of electricity to source an increasing
proportion of their electricity from renewable sources (based on the expected level of renewable energy
production in each year plus a 10 percent spread in order to prevent certificate prices from falling
sharply). Suppliers meet their obligations by presenting sufficient Renewables Obligation Certificates
(ROCs) or by paying an equivalent amount into a fund.

The proceeds of the fund are paid back to those suppliers that have presented ROCs in proportion to
the number of ROCs presented. Since April 2009, the RO has been banded so that differing
technologies receive different levels of support depending on the expected costs. The revision of this
framework concluded in 2012 and, as a result, projects starting after 1 April 2013 (or later for some
technologies) received revised levels of support.

The RO will close for new projects no later than 31 March 2017 and Government has implemented the
Contract for Difference (CFDs) mechanism that was part of Electricity Market Reform (EMR). For solar
photovoltaic generation plants above 5MW, the RO closed in April 2015. The RO closed in March 2016
for solar photovoltaic plants at 5 MW or below and in May 2016 for onshore wind, in both cases subject
to grace periods. The wind farms in Scottish Power's onshore renewables pipeline that received
planning permission in time to qualify for the relevant grace period, will be eligible to accredit under the
RO so long as they commence generation 31 March 2017. The RO remains in place for facilities entering
the scheme before the relevant closure date; payments will continue until 31 March 2027 for projects
that started generation before 1 April 2009 and for 20 years after entry into the RO for later dated
projects. The Energy Act 2013 foresees changing from the RO to a premium payment on substantially
similar terms.

Elect Market Reform (EMR)

The principal elements of the United Kingdom Government's EMR programme are:
- anewincentive scheme, based on CFDs to support low carbon generation; and
- aCapacity Market to support security of supply (market-wide auction mechanism).

The CFD allocations to date have taken place within the constraints of a budget for low carbon support
measures known as the Levy Control Framework (LCF). An initial tranche of contracts were approved
during 2014 by the United Kingdom Government as part of a transitional “Final Investment Decision
Enabling Process”. The first Allocation Round took place on 4 February 2015 in two “pots”; one for
established technologies (mainly onshore wind and solar) and a second one for less established
technologies (mainly offshore wind). Scottish Power's 714 MW East Anglia ONE offshore Wind Farm
achieved a contract in the auction at a price of GBP 119 per MWh. The Government has now announced
another CFD Allocation Round for less established technologies which is due to commence in April
2017. A budget allocation of GBP 290 million (2011/12 prices) has been made for this competitive
auction within an overall budget of GBP 730 million for up to three Allocation Rounds before May 2020
subject to satisfactory evidence of cost reductions over time. The Government is also currently
considering the nature of any future cost control mechanism such as the LCF after the current LCF end
date of 2020/21. A further announcement may take place on 8 March 2017 at the time of the Spring
Budget.

Annual Capacity Market auctions took place in December 2014, 2015 and 2016, for capacity delivery in
winter 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The most recent of these auctions cleared at a price of GBP
22.50 per kW/year. A new Capacity Market Early Auction was held in early 2017 for delivery in Winter
2017/18; this cleared at a lower price of GBP 6.95 per kW/year.

EU-ETS and United Kingdom Carbon Price Support

As in all EU Member States, generators in the United Kingdom participate in the EU-ETS. Since 2013,
the Government is required to auction all allocations to the power sector. The Climate Change Act 2008
sets out a trajectory towards reducing CO2 emissions from 1990 levels by at least 80% by 2050, with
interim reduction targets. The Carbon Price Support mechanism is a United Kingdom tax imposed on
fossil fuels used for electricity generation at differential rates which simulate a charge on the CO2
emissions. It was intended to smooth the path of carbon prices in the United Kingdom power sector in
the event of instability in the EU-ETS, by topping up the EU-ETS price to a pre-set trajectory. In practice,
the EU-ETS price is much lower than expected and in order to mitigate the impact on electricity prices,
the United Kingdom Government has capped the Carbon Price Support tax at GBP 18 per tonne CO2
until at least 2020. At Budget 2016 it was decided to roll forward this tax rate (uprated for inflation) to
2020/21 and this decision was confirmed at the Autumn Statement.

Climate Change Levy (CCL) exemption

As announced in summer budget 2015 the exemption for renewable electricity from the Climate Change
Levy (a tax on non-domestic electricity users) ended on 1 August 2015. This has removed a small
additional revenue stream for renewable generators though its value was expected to decline in any
event around 2020.

Energy Companies Obligation (ECO!

Energy suppliers who supply over 250,000 domestic customers are required to achieve energy
efficiency improvements among their customers. As with any other cost, the costs of making those
improvements can be incorporated by suppliers into tariffs, subject to the need to remain competitive in
the market. ECO ran from 1 January 2013 to 31 March 2015. A separate phase runs from 1 April 2015
to 31 March 2017. The Government has said that from April 2017, ECO will be replaced by a cheaper
scheme costing GBP 640 million a year (based initially on a transition scheme). Details were confirmed
on 30 January 2017.

Coal closure

In November 2015, the former Secretary of State Amber Rudd announced plans to consult on
requirements for all coal power stations without CCS to close by 2025 (subject to any security of supply
issues). In late 2016 the Government published a consultation on possible regulatory options to facilitate
this. The impact of any such measures on Scottish Power is limited due to the closure of Longannet.

Pollution Control

The Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC), the Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD)
and the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) cover the regulatory regime for controlling the pollution from
certain industrial activities, including thermal combustion generation, and impose limits on various
categories of emissions. In particular, the LCPD limits the emission of sulphur dioxide (SOz), oxides of
nitrogen (NOx) and particles from power plants, whereby operators of such plants have the option of
meeting those requirements or accepting a limited hour derogation prior to their closure by the end of
2015. The IED puts in place a similar regime for 2016 and beyond, with more stringent standards. The
IED is transposed into United Kingdom’s law through the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland)
Regulations 2012 and amendments to the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations
2010. These controls are enforced by the Environment Agency or, in Scotland, the Scottish
Environmental Protection Agency.

Industry regulation in USA

Electricity and natural gas distribution

Some of the most important specific regulatory processes that affect AVANGRID Networks, Inc.
(hereinafter, AVANGRID NETWORKS) include the New York rate settlement for NYSEG and RG&E,
the Connecticut United Illuminating distribution rate case decision, the Maine and Connecticut
transmission Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Return on Equity (ROE) case and the
Reforming Energy Vision (REV) process of New York.

The revenues of AVANGRID NETWORKS are essentially regulated, being based on tariffs established
in accordance with administrative procedures set by the various regulatory bodies. The tariffs applied to
regulated activities in the United States are approved by the regulatory commissions of the different
States and are based on the cost of providing service. The revenues of each regulated utility are set to
be sufficient to cover all its operating costs, including energy costs, finance costs and the costs of equity
(the last one reflects the Company's capital ratio and the reasonable return on equity).

Energy costs that are set on the New York and New England wholesale markets are passed on to
consumers. The difference between energy costs that are budgeted for and those that are actually
incurred by the utilities is offset by applying compensation procedures that result in either immediate or
deferred tariff adjustments. These procedures apply to other costs, which are in most cases exceptional
(effects of extreme weather conditions, environmental factors, regulatory and accounting changes,
treatment of vulnerable customers, etc.) that are offset in the tariff process. Any delivery profit from New
York and Connecticut that allows a service company exceeds its profitability objectives (usually due to
a better than expected cost efficiency), is shared among the service company and its clients, resulting
in a decrease in the future tariff.

Each of the eight supply companies in AVANGRID NETWORKS, must comply with regulatory
procedures that differ in form but in all cases conform to the basic framework outlined above. As a
general rule, tariff reviews cover various years (three in New York and Connecticut) and provide
reasonable returns on equity, protection and automatic adjustments for exceptional costs incurred and
efficiency incentives.

1. New York

New York State Electric & Gas Corporation (NYSEG) and Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation
(RG&E) Rate Plans:

. 2015 NY Rate Filings

On 20 May 2015, NYSEG and RG&E filed electric and gas rate cases with the NYPSC. The companies
are requesting rate increases for NYSEG Electric, NYSEG Gas and RG&E Gas, while for RG&E Electric
are requesting rate decreases.

NYSEG Electric requested USD 126 million (7% overall) in additional annual delivery revenue to recover
prior storm costs, move to a full cycle vegetation management trim programme in line with best industry
practice, and earn an adequate return on its investment. RG&E Electric proposed a USD 10 million rate
decrease (1% overall) reflecting the return to customers of funds collected during its 2010 rate plan
associated with management efficiencies and costs lower than set levels. NYSEG Gas and RG&E Gas
are requesting additional revenues of USD 38 million (8% overall) and USD 20 million (5% overall),
respectively.

The companies requested a 10.06% return on equity and a 50% equity ratio. The rate filings are for one
year but the companies have indicated their interest in pursuing a multi-year settlement.

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

The NYPSC staff and other parties filed testimony in September 2015 opposing the rate increase
requests. The NYPSC Staff proposed a delivery increase of USD 11.8 million for NYSEG Electric, a
delivery rate decrease for RG&E Electric of USD 23.4 million, a delivery decrease of USD 2.8 million for
NYSEG Gas and a delivery decrease of USD 2.9 million for RG&E Gas. The NYPSC proposed an 8.7%
ROE and a 48% equity ratio. NYPSC also proposed to offset the NYSEG Electric storm deferral balance
of USD 262 million with excess depreciation reserve amounts which NYPSC staff claims is USD 665
million at NYSEG Electric and USD 129 million at RG&E Electric. The NYPSC stated it was open to
discussing a multi-year rate plan for the companies.

On 19 February 2016, the NYSEG, RG&E and other signatory parties filed a Joint Proposal, or the
Proposal, with the NYPSC for a three-year rate plan commencing on 1 May 2016. The Proposal
balances the varied interests of the signatory parties including but not limited to maintaining the
companies’ credit quality and mitigating the rate impacts to customers. The Proposal reflects many
customer attributes including: acceleration of the companies’ natural gas leak prone main replacement
programs and enhanced electric vegetation management to provide continued safe and reliable service.
The delivery rate increase can be summarized as follows:

4 May 2016 4 May 2017 1 May 2018
Rate Delivery Rate Delivery Rate Delivery
Rate Rate Rate
Increase Increase Increase
Increase Increase Increase
Millions % Millions % Millions %
Utility usD ° USD ° usD °

RG&E Gas 8.8 5.20 77 4.40 9.5 5.20

The allowed rate of return on common equity for NYSEG Electric and NYSEG Gas is 9.00%. The equity
ratio for both Electric and Gas is 48%. The Proposal includes an Earnings Sharing Mechanism (ESM)
applicable. The customer share of earnings would increase at higher earnings levels, with customers
receiving 50%, 75% and 90% of earnings over 9.5%, 10% and 10.5% of ROE, respectively, in the first
year. Earnings thresholds would increase in subsequent years.

The Proposal reflects the recovery of deferred NYSEG Electric storm costs of approximately USD 262
million, of which USD 123 million will be amortized over 10 years and the remaining USD 139 million
will be amortized over five years. The Proposal also continues reserve accounting for qualifying Major
Storms (USD 21.4 million annually). Incremental maintenance costs incurred to restore service in
qualifying divisions will be chargeable to the Major Storm Reserve provided that they meet certain
thresholds.

The Proposal maintains current electric reliability performance measures (and associated potential
negative revenue adjustments for failing to meet established performance levels) which include the
system average interruption frequency index and the customer average interruption duration index. The
Proposal also modifies certain gas safety performance measures at the company, including those
relating to the replacement of main leak prone, leak backlog management, emergency response, and
damage prevention. The Proposal establishes threshold performance levels for designated aspects of
customer service quality and continues and expands bill reduction and arrears forgiveness Low Income
Programs at increased funding levels. The Proposal provides for the implementation of NYSEG’s Energy
Smart Community (“ESC”) Project in the Ithaca region which will serve as a test-bed for implementation
and deployment of Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) initiatives. The ESC Project will be supported by
NYSEG’s planned rollout of Distribution Automation and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) to
customers on circuits in the Ithaca region. REV-related incremental costs and fees will be included in
the Rate Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) to the extent cost recovery is not provided for elsewhere. Under
the Proposal, we will implement a RAM, which will be applicable to all customers, to return or collect
RAM eligible deferrals and costs, including: (1) property taxes; (2) Major Storm deferral balances; (3)
gas leak prone pipe replacement; (4) REV costs and fees which are not covered by other recovery
mechanisms; and (5) Electric Pole Attachment revenues.

The Proposal provides for partial or full reconciliation of certain expenses including, but not limited to:
pensions, other postretirement benefits; property taxes; variable rate debt and new fixed rate debt; gas
research and development; environmental remediation costs; Major Storms; nuclear electric insurance
limited credits; economic development; and Low Income Programs. The Proposal also includes a
downward-only Net Plant reconciliation. In addition, the Proposal includes downward-only
reconciliations for the costs of: electric distribution and gas vegetation management; pipeline integrity;
and incremental maintenance. The Proposal provides that we continue the electric RDMs on a total
revenue per class basis and the gas RDMs on a revenue per customer basis.

A hearing on the Proposal was held on 7 April 2016 and a NYPSC order adopting the Proposal was
issued on 15 June 2016, with retroactive application beginning on 1 May 2016. The Commission also
provided for additional modifications including a timeline for developing the Earnings Adjustment
Mechanism described in the Commission’s REV Track 2 Order.

. Reforming the Energy Vision:

In April 2014, the NYPSC commenced a proceeding titled Reforming the Energy Vision (REV), which is
an initiative to reform New York State’s energy industry and regulatory practices. REV has followed
several simultaneous paths: Track 1 deals with market design and platform technology and Track 2
deals with the regulatory reform. REV’s objectives include the promotion of more efficient use of energy,
increasing the utilization of renewable energy resources such as wind and solar power (in support of
New York State’s renewable energy goals) and a wider deployment of “distributed” energy resources,
such as micro-grids, in-situ power supplies, and storage.

REV is also intended to promote greater use of advanced energy management products to enhance
demand elasticity and efficiencies. Track 1 of this initiative involves a collaborative process to examine
the role of distribution utilities in enabling market based deployment of distributed energy resources to
promote load management and greater system efficiency, including peak load reductions. We are
participating in the initiative with other New York utilities and are providing our unique perspective. The
NYPSC has issued a Track 1 Order in 2015, which acknowledges the utilities’ role as a Distribution
System Platform (DSP) provider, and requires the utilities to file an initial Distribution System
Implementation Plan (DSIP) by 30 June 2016. The DSIP was filed on 30 June 2016 and included
information regarding the proposed deployment of Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Various
proceedings have also been initiated by the NYPSC which are REV related, and each proceeding has
its own schedule. These proceedings include the Clean Energy Fund, Demand Response Tariffs, Net
Energy Metering/Value of Distributed Energy Resources and Community Choice Aggregation.

Track 2 of the REV initiative is also underway, and through a NYPSC Staff Whitepaper review process,
is examining potential changes in current regulatory, tariff, market design and incentive structures which
could better align utility interests with achieving New York state and NYPSC’s policy objectives. New
York utilities will also be addressing related regulatory issues in their individual rate cases. A Track 2
Order was issued in May 2016. The Track 2 Order includes requirements for all electric utilities to file: a
system efficiency proposal, an interconnect survey process and proposed Earnings Adjustment
Mechanism (EAM), a progress report on aggregated data reporting, an aggregated data privacy policy
statement, revisions to their standby service tariffs, a review of their standby rate allocations and
proposed revisions, one or more Smart Home Rate demonstration proposals, and revisions to voluntary
time of use rates, as well as to propose EAMs for Energy Efficiency and Customer Engagement.
Additionally, the order requires electric utilities to participate in a scorecard metric collaborative and a
stakeholder process to develop Clean Energy Standard EAM(s). On 1 December 2016, NYSEG and
RG&E filed their proposed EAM. On 20 December 2016, NYSEG and RG&E filed a petition for the full
deployment of Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI) with the Commission. The AMI petition requests
authorization to implement full-scale AMI at NYSEG Electric, NYSEG Gas, RG&E Electric and RG&E
Gas. Approximately 1.8 million electric AMI meters and gas modules will be deployed. The companies
also requested to implement a surcharge to recover the investment until such values can be included in
base delivery rates in their next rate cases. The Companies expect the Commission to address their
petition in 2017.

. Reliability Support Service Agreement in the Ginna Nuclear Power Plant

Ginna Nuclear Power Plant, LLC (GNPP), which is a subsidiary of Constellation Energy Nuclear Group,
LLC (CENG), owns and operates the R.E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant, a 581 MW single-unit pressurized
water reactor located in Ontario, New York. In May 2014, the New York Independent System Operator
(NYISO) produced a reliability study, confirming that the Ginna Facility needs to remain in operation to
avoid bulk transmission and non-bulk local distribution system reliability violations in 2015 to 2018.

On 11 July 2014, GNPP filed a petition requesting that the NYPSC initiates a proceeding to examine a
proposal for the continued operation of the Ginna Facility. Ginna asserted that in the two preceding
calendar years, 2012 and 2013, it had sustained cumulative losses at the Facility of nearly USD 100
million (including the allocation of CENG corporate overhead) and that CENG had not been
compensated for any operational risk or an appropriate return on its investment over this period. Based
on the results of the 2014 Reliability Study, GNPP requested that: 1) the NYPSC determines that the
continued operation of the Ginna Facility is required to preserve system reliability; and 2) the NYPSC
issues an order directing RG&E to negotiate and file a Reliability Support Services Agreement (RSSA)
for the continued operation of the Ginna Facility.

In November 2014, the NYPSC ruled that GNPP had demonstrated that the Ginna nuclear plant was
neccesary to maintain the system’s reliability and that its actions regarding the relevant retirement notice
requirements were satisfactory. The NYPSC also accepted the findings of the 2014 reliability study and
stated that it established “the reliability need for continued operation of the Ginna Facility that is the
essential prerequisite to negotiating an RSSA.” As such, the NYPSC ordered RG&E and GNPP to
negotiate an RSSA.

On 13 February 2015, RG&E submitted to the NYPSC RSSA between RG&E and GNPP. RG&E
requested that the NYPSC accepted the RSSA and approve cost recovery by RG&E from its customers
of all amounts payable to GNPP under the RSSA utilizing the cost recovery surcharge mechanism.

On 21 October 2015, RG&E, GNPP, New York Public Service Commission, Utility Intervention Unit and
Multiple Intervenors filed a Joint Proposal with the NYPSC for approval of the RSSA, as modified. The
Joint Proposal provides a term of the RSSA from 1 April 2015 through 31 March 2017. RG&E shall make
monthly payments to Ginna in the amount of USD 15.4 million. RG&E will be entitled to 70% of revenues
from Ginna’s sales into the NYISO energy and capacity markets, while Ginna will be entitled to 30% of
such revenues. The signatory parties recommend that the NYPSC authorize RG&E to implement a rate
surcharge effective 1 January 2016 to recover amounts paid to Ginna pursuant to the RSSA. RG&E's
payment obligation to Ginna shall not begin until the rate surcharge is in effect and FERC has issued
an order authorizing the FERC Settlement agreement in the Settlement Docket. RG&E will use deferred
rate credit amounts (regulatory liabilities) to offset the full amount of the Deferred Collection Amount
(including carrying costs), plus credit amounts to offset all RSSA costs that exceed USD 2.3 million per
month, not to exceed a total use of credits in the amount of USD 110 million, applicable through 30 June
2017. To the extent that the available credits are insufficient to satisfy the final payment from RG&E to
Ginna then the RSSA surcharge may continue past 31 March 2017 to recover up to USD 2.3 million per
month until the final payment has been recovered by RG&E from ratepayers. In the month following the
expiration of the term on 31 March 2017, Ginna shall prepare and issue an invoice to RG&E for, and
RG&E shall pay to Ginna, a one-time payment in the amount of USD 11.5 million. This amount is being
accrued pro-rata over the term of the agreement and will be recovered from ratepayers. On 23 February
2016, the NYPSC unanimously adopted the Joint Proposal in the Ginna RSSA proceeding as in the
public interest.

° New York Transco

Networks holds an approximate ownership of 20% in the New York Transco. The New York Transco
was established by the New York transmission utilities to develop, own, and operate the electric
transmission in New York. In December 2014, New York Transco filed for regulatory approval of its
tariffs, terms, and conditions with FERC. The filing requests a base ROE of 10.6%, plus 150 basis points
as incentives, recognition of construction work in progress, a tariff formula mechanism, and a proposed
cost allocation. Various parties, including the NYPSC, have protested the filing with FERC, including the
base ROE, the ROE incentives, and the cost allocation. The New York Transco will not make final
decisions on transmission project development until a FERC decision.

On 2 April 2015, the FERC issued an order granting, inter alia, the New York Transco’s owners’ request
for a 50 basis points adder for NY Transco’s membership in the NYISO RTO, subject to the adder being
capped within the zone of reasonableness after a determination of where within that zone its base level
ROE should be set. The FERC also set the formula rate and base ROE issue for hearing and settlement
judge procedures. In addition, the FERC rejected the New York Transco’s owners’ cost allocation
method for the Transmission Owner Transmission Solutions, or TOTS, Projects because it would
allocate costs to Power Supply Long Island and New York Power Authority that they did not voluntarily
agree to pay.

On 5 November 2015, the New York Transco’s owners, filed the Settlement with the FERC to resolve
all outstanding issues associated with the TOTS Projects, including issues related to the TOTS Projects
that were set for hearing and issues pending on rehearing. The issues regarding certain other projects
remain pending. The Settlement addressed the financial terms that are components of New York
TransCo’s revenue requirement for the proposed Transmission Owner Transmission Solution (TOTS)
Projects, including the base ROE of 9.50%, and a 50-basis point ROE adder, the capital structure of
53%, and the cost allocation under the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) Open
Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) for the TOTS Projects. On 17 March 2016, the FERC approved the
Settlement.

. Net Energy Metering

On 16 October 2015, the NY Commission issued an Order Establishment Interim Ceilings on the
Interconnection of Net Metered Generation (the Floating Cap Order). There the Commission directed
that net metering limitations should “float” until completion of a proceeding to develop an interim method
of evaluating the benefits of distributed energy resources. The New York Joint Utilities petitioned for
rehearing of the Floating Cap Order, expressing concern that an unlimited number of resources could
materialize absent a cap, leading to unanticipated and unbounded bill increases for customers. The
Commission has not yet acted upon that rehearing request.

Following the issuance of the Floating Cap Order and the launch of the CDG program, the Joint Utilities
experienced a surge in new applications for net metered resources, ultimately leading to more than
4,000 MW of interconnection applications. The Commission instituted the Value of DER proceeding in
response to the decision to float the net metering cap and the promise to adopt a “new regulatory
approach” for DER valuation,

On 28 October 2016 in Case 15-E-0751, In the Matter of the Value of Distributed Energy Resources
(“Value of DER Proceeding”), NYPSC Staff issued its Report and Recommendations. The Staff Report
contained a number of recommendations. The Joint Utilities’ filed comments on 5 December 2016 along
with 32 other parties. The Comission is expected to rule of the proceeding in 1Q2017.

2. Connecticut

° Ul rate case

On 1 July 2016, UI filed an application with the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, or
PURA, requesting approval of a three-year rate plan commencing 1 January 2017, and extending
through 31 December 2019. Ul’s application requests an increase of USD 65.6 million in 2017, an
additional USD 21.1 million in 2018, and an additional USD 13.4 million in 2019, totaling USD 100.1
million over the three years. During the litigation of the case, the three-year cumulative request was
modified to USD 98.3 million. The original application includes a rate levelization proposal to moderate
the customer impact of the necessary revenue increases. The proposal defers a portion of the first and
second year increases and spreads recovery of the overall increase by approximately equivalent
amounts over the three years of the rate plan with carrying charges included. The proposal results in
levelized revenue requirement increases of USD 40.7 million in 2017, USD 47.4 million in 2018 and
USD 39.1 million in 2019, followed by an offset of USD 25.6 million at the end of the three year rate plan
to equate the levelized recovery to the non-levelized revenue requirement increase.

Ul’s rate request is attributable primarily to the amount of capital expenditures devoted to its electric
distribution system for the purpose of reliability and system resiliency, both in relation to routine
operations and during major storm events. Ul’s application also proposes continuation of its revenue
decoupling mechanism and proposes a new Earnings Sharing Mechanism (ESM). Under the proposed
ESM, 50% of Ul’s earnings in excess of the allowed ROE, plus a deadband above the allowed ROE,
would be flowed through to the benefit of customers. The proposed ESM includes a 20-basis point
deadband in 2017 above the authorized ROE, within which there would be no sharing. This deadband
would be 30 basis points in 2018 and 40 basis points in 2019. Ul proposes to continue applying any
Dollars due to customers to reduce the storm regulatory asset, if one exists. If none exists, then the
customer share would be provided through a bill credit.

On 15 December 2016, the PURA issued its Final Decision authorizing a cumulative three year rate of
USD 57 million for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. The 2017 rate increase is USD 43.0 M, an additional
USD 11.5 million in 2018, and an additional USD 2.9 million in 2019. The PURA provided a 9.10% return
on equity and 50% equity ratio. The three year rate plan retains the existing earnings sharing level
whereby earnings above the allowed ROE are shared equally between customers and shareholders.
The Company's revenue decoupling mechanism continues. The PURA did reduce the residential basic
service charge to USD 9.65 per month.

3. Maine

CMP’s and Ul’s transmission tariffs are determined by a tariff regulated by the FERC and administered
by ISO New England (ISO-NE). Transmission rates are set annually pursuant to a FERC authorized
formula that allows for recovery of direct and allocated transmission operating and maintenance
expenses, as well as the return on assets invested. Prior to 16 October 2014, the FERC provided a base
ROE of 11.14% and additional ROE incentives applicable to assets based upon vintage, voltage and
other factors.

On 30 September 2011, the Massachusetts General Attorney, Massachusetts Department of Public
Utilities, Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission,
Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, Vermont Department of Public Service, numerous
New England consumer advocate agencies and transmission tariff customers collectively filed a
complaint (Complaint |) with the FERC pursuant to sections 206 and 306 of the Federal Power Act. The
filing parties seek an order from the FERC reducing the 11.14% base return on equity (ROE) used in
calculating formula rates for transmission service under the ISO-New England Open Access
Transmission Tariff (OATT) to 9.2%. CMP and UI are New England Transmission Owners (NETOs) with
assets and service rates that are governed by the OATT and will thereby be affected by any FERC order
resulting from the filed complaint.

On 19 June 2014, the FERC issued its decision in Complaint |, establishing a methodology and setting
an issue for a paper hearing. On 16 October 2014, FERC issued its final decision in the Complaint |
setting the base ROE at 10.57% and a maximum total ROE of 11.74% (base plus incentive ROEs) for
the October 2011 — December 2012 period as well as prospectively from 16 October 2014, and ordered
the NETOs to file a refund report. On 17 November 2014, the NETOs filed a refund report.

On 3 March 2015, the FERC issued an order on requests for rehearing of its 16 October 2014 decision.
The March order upheld the FERC’s 19 June 2014 decision and further clarified that the 11.74% ROE
cap will be applied on a project specific basis and not on a transmission owner's total average return. In
June 2015 the NETOs filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia of the
FERC'’s final order. The appeal is currently pending.

On 26 December 2012, a second, ROE complaint (Complaint II) for a subsequent rate period was filed
requesting the ROE be reduced to 8.7%. On 19 June 2014, FERC accepted Complaint Il, established a
15-month refund effective date of 27 December 2012, and set the matter for hearing using the
methodology established in the Complaint |.

On 31 July 2014, a third ROE complaint (Complaint III) was filed for a subsequent rate period requesting
the ROE be reduced to 8.84%. On 24 November 2014, FERC accepted the Complaint Ill, established a
15-month refund effective date of 31 July 2014, and set this matter, consolidated with Complaint Il, for
hearing in June 2015. Hearings were held in June 2015 on Complaints II and Ill before a FERC
Administrative Law Judge, relating to the refund periods and going forward period. On 29 July 2015,
post-hearing briefs were filed by parties and on 26 August 2015 reply briefs were filed by parties. On 13
July 2015, the NETOs filed a petition for review of FERC’s orders establishing hearing and consolidation
procedures for Complaints II and III with the U.S. Court of Appeals. The Initial Decision determined that,
1) for the 15-month refund period in Complaint Il, the base ROE should be 9.59% and that the ROE Cap
(base ROE plus incentive ROEs) should be 10.42% and 2) for the 15-month refund period in Complaint
Ill and prospectively, the base ROE should be 10.90% and that the ROE Cap should be 12.19%. The
Initial Decision is the Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation to the FERC Commissioners. The
FERC is expected to make its final decision in early 2017.

CMP and UI reserved for refunds for Complaints |, Il and III consistent with the FERC’s 3 March 2015
final decision in Complaint |. The CMP and UI total reserve associated with Complaints |, Il and Ill is
USD 21.4 million and USD 4.2 million, respectively, as of 30 September 2016. If adopted as final, the
impact of the initial decision would be an additional aggregate reserve for Complaints II and Ill of USD
17.1 million pretax and USD 10.2 million, net of tax, which is based upon currently available information
for these proceedings.

On 29 April 2016, a fourth ROE complaint (Complaint IV) was filed for a rate period subsequent to prior
complaints requesting the base ROE be 8.61% and ROE Cap be 11.24%. On 20 June 2016, FERC
accepted the Complaint IV, established a 15-month refund effective date of 29 April 2016, and set the
matter for hearing and settlement judge procedures.

On 6 December 2016 a three judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments to
FERC’s final order in this complaint. A decision is expected by Q2 2017.

. Net Energy Metering

On 14 September 2016, the MPUC issued a Notice of Rulemaking regarding Ammendments to the Net
Energy Metering Rule. The Commission initiated a rulemaking to consider several proposed
amendments to its net energy billing rule (Chapter 313). First, the proposed amended rule would
increase the maximum size for an eligible generating facility from 660 kilowatts to one megawatt.
Second, the proposed amended rule would gradually reduce the T&D portion of a customer's bill which
is eligible to be netted against the generating facility's output, while netting of the supply portion of the
bill will remain largely unchanged. Third, the proposed amended rule would grandfather existing NEB
customers for a fifteen year period. Fourth, the proposed amended rule would add specific provisions
that allow and provide consumer protections for community net energy billing and net energy billing
leases. As noted by the Commission in its Notice of Rulemaking, these proposed amendments would
do little to impact existing NEB customers.

CMP filed initial and reply comments in response to the Commission’s Notice of Rulemaking. Other
parties, including industry experts also provided comments. The MPUC made a decision on its Notice
of Rulemaking on 31 January 2017. The MPUC has not yet issued the final rule but did issue a notice
stating that the resulting rule a) grandfathers existing customers for fifteen years, b) for new entrants it
locks in the phase down level, at the year in which they enter, for fifteen years, and c) maintains incentive
margins consistent with the declining costs of solar technology. Below is additional detail of the ruling.

e¢  Grandfathering of existing NEB Customers. All existing customers and new customer
installations that occur prior to 1 January 2018 will be grandfathered for fifteen years. This
means those customers will receive the current incentives and terms as they exist today.

¢ Grandfathering of New Entrants to NEB. As new customers sign up over the next 10 years,
netting of the transmission and distribution (T&D) portion of the bill will be gradually decreased
to reflect reductions in the costs of small renewable generation technology. For example, in the
first year NEB customers will receive the full value of the supply portion, and 90% of the T&D
portion for each year of the fifteen years.

e Maintaining Incentive Levels. The incentives to NEB customers under the new Rule should not
change the length of time it takes for a customer to recoup their investment. The estimated
payback for new installations will be similar to what it has been historically. As noted above, for
a customer installation signed in year one, the full incentive for supply and 90% of the incentive
for T&D is received for fifteen years. As the cost of technology declines, the incentive for T&D
also declines for new entrants. For a new customer installation in year two, for example, the
cost of the solar panels will have declined but the incentive will also decline to 80% for T&D and
the full incentive for supply.

¢ The rule only applies to residential solar installation on roofs. Many projects are being built
across the state today based on existing market mechanisms. The Commission decided not to
address larger scaled projects and community projects as part of the NEB rules to ensure we
stayed within our regulatory function, and in light of legislative initiatives in these areas.

e Includes Renewable Energy Credit (REC) Based Revenue Stream. The new Rule allows to a
NEB customer to choose to monetize the value of their solar generation and receive a credit for
that value. NEB installations will be automatically classified as a Maine Class | Renewable
Resource.

° MNG Rate Case

On 5 March 2015, MNG filed a rate case in order to further recover future investments and provide safe
and adequate service. MNG requested a 10.0% ROE and 50.0% equity ratio. The MPUC Staff
recommended a separate revenue requirement for MNG’s Augusta customers and MNG’s non-Augusta
customers. The MPUC also recommended a USD 19.95 million disallowance of the Augusta Expansion
investment based upon the Staff's conclusion that MNG’s management of the Augusta Expansion
Project was imprudent.

On 6 November 2015, a stipulation was filed with the MPUC, which was executed by MNG, the Office
of Public Advocate and the city of Augusta. The stipulation contained a combined revenue requirement
for Augusta and non-Augusta based on a 9.55% ROE and 50% equity ratio. The stipulation also
provided for an initial Augusta investment disallowance of USD 6 million and an investment phase-in of
USD 10 million. On 22 December 2015, the MPUC rejected the proposed stipulation as not in the public
interest. In January 2016, the Administrative Law Judge established a new litigation schedule. The
litigation was suspended at the end of January 2016 for settlement discussions. We reserved USD 6
million for this case at the end of 2015.

On 3 May 2016, all active parties to the case filed a stipulation that settled all matters at issue in the
case and reflected a 10-year rate plan through 30 April 2026. The MPUC approved the stipulation on
17 May 2016, for new rates effective 1 June 2016. The settlement structure for non-Augusta customers
includes a 34.6% delivery revenue increase over five years with an allowed 9.55% ROE and 50%
common equity ratio. The settlement structure for Augusta customers includes a 10-year rate plan with
existing Augusta customers being charged rates equal to non-Augusta customers plus a surcharge that
increases annually for five years. New Augusta customers will have rates set based on an alternate fuel
market model. In year seven of the rate plan MNG will submit a cost of service filing for the Augusta
area to determine if the rate plan should continue. This cost of service filing will exclude USD 15 million
of initial 2012/2013 gross plant investment, however the stipulation allows for accelerated depreciation
of these assets. If the Augusta area’s cost of service filing illustrates results above a 14.55% ROE then
the rate plan may cease, otherwise the rate plan would continue. A disallowance for the initial 2012/2013
gross plant investment is not part of the approved stipulation. The reserve of USD 6 million for this case
was reversed in May 2016.

Electricity generation from renewable energy resources

Numerous State Governments and the Federal Government have adopted measures and implemented
numerous regulations designed to foster the development of electricity production from renewable
resources. State programmes have generally come in the form of: 1) Renewable Portfolio Standards
(RPS's) that usually require utilities to generate or purchase a minimum amount of renewable electricity;
and 2) tax incentives. To date, the Federal Government has primarily supported renewable energy
development through tax credits for production and investment as well as accelerated tax depreciation.

Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have adopted mandatory RPS requirements, which vary
across the states but will generally range from 15-33% of the generation by 2025. The requirements are
typically implemented through a system of tradable renewable energy certificates that verify that a kWh
of electricity has been generated from a renewable resource. Several state legislatures have debated
whether to repeal or roll back significantly their RPS requirements. In 2014 Ohio enacted legislation to
freeze its RPS programme until 2017; in 2015, Kansas replaced its mandatory RPS with a 20% voluntary
standard as part of a compromise that retained existing property tax exemptions. In contrast, California
in 2015 and Oregon in 2016 enacted legislation to increase the state RPS to 50%.

Most states also offer a variety of tax incentives to promote investment in renewable energy resources.
For instance, Washington and Colorado, among other states, exempt the sale and use of renewable
energy equipment from taxation, which reduces development costs substantially. Several states reduce
property tax requirements on renewable generation facilities through enterprise zones or similar
designations, while Minnesota has substituted a property tax in lieu of fix production tax. Other states,
such as Texas, boost the construction of electrical infrastructure (Competitive Renewable Energy
Zones) to ease the transportation of renewable electricity towards load points.

In 1992, the US Congress enacted legislation that established a Production Tax Credit (PTC) of USD
15 per MWh (adjusted for inflation) for the production of electricity from wind power facilities for the first
ten years of a project’s operation. This programme has been renewed on several occasions and has
been expanded to include the production of electricity from several other renewable resources, including
biomass, geothermal, solid urban wastes and hydroelectric power. In 2005, Congress established a
30% investment tax credit (ITC) for solar power projects. The PTC, which is currently valued at USD
23 per MWh, was extended and phased out by the Congress on 18 December 2015. Developers that
start construction on a wind project before 2017 will qualify for the full credit, while those starting
construction between 2017 and 2019 will qualify for a reduced-value credit. These qualifying facilities
may also elect to take a 30% ITC rather than the PTC. Solar ITC was also extended and phased out by
Congress on 18 December 2015. Developers that start construction on a solar project before 2020 will
qualify for a 30% investment tax credit (ITC). Projects for which construction begins after 2019 are
eligible for a lower ITC. The purposes of the PTC and ITC are to make electricity production from
renewable resources more competitive relative to fossil fuel and nuclear power facilities.

In addition to the PTC and ITC, renewable energy facilities are eligible for accelerated five-year tax
depreciation on their investments. This programme is known as the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery
System. As a result of legislation enacted in 2008, 2009, 2013 and 2014, many facilities placed in service
between 2008 and 2014 qualified for bonus depreciation which allowed 50% depreciation deduction in
the year a facility was placed in service. In December 2015, Congress enacted legislation to extend and
phase out bonus depreciation. Companies can through 2017 deduct 50% of certain capital investments
during the year the investment is made. If the investment occurs in 2018, companies can deduct 40%
and if it occurs in 2019 only 30% of deduction is allowed.

With respect to interstate transmission networks, the FERC has adopted a series of requirements on
transmission operators to improve access and reduce costs for variable generation like wind and solar
power. FERC Order 764 is driving changes in scheduling practices and other activities that will increase
forecasting accuracy and reduce needed reserves, resulting in lower technology integration costs.

4.5 Industry regulation in Mexico

The Mexican Energy Reform, which began at the end of 2013 with the amendment of Mexican
Constitution, set in motion the deep transformation of the electric sector, through the creation of a
completely new regulatory framework. As a consequence of this constitutional reform, nine new laws
were enacted during 2014 and 2015 and 25 regulations were either created or reformed.

Although the energy reform is aimed mainly at the hydrocarbons sector, it will also offer new business
opportunities in the generation, transmission, distribution and management of electricity infrastructure.
This transformation opens the energy sector to private investment in activities that were previously
reserved to the Government.

The Hydrocarbons Law (LH) regulates activities like petroleum treatment and refining natural gas
processing export and import of hydrocarbons and petroleum products; transportation, storage,
distribution, compression, liquefaction, decompression, re-gasification, marketing and sale to the public
of natural gas, hydrocarbons, petroleum products and petrochemicals, along with the management of
integrated systems. All these activities are now open to private investment and subject to the
Hydrocarbons Law.

One of the goals of the industry restructuring is to improve the competitiveness of low-carbon power
generation. Concurrently with the COP 21 in Paris, the Mexican Congress and Senate passed the
Energy Transition Law (Ley de Transicién Energetica - LTE), which creates binding obligations for clean
energy generation and emission reductions targets for the future, bringing a strong legal framework to
the development of clean energy projects in Mexico.

The previous regulatory framework will continue being applicable to existing businesses and facilities,

before the Enegy Reform (among them, Iberdrola’s businesses), which provides stability and legal
certainty in the Mexican regulatory context.

1. The Electric Reform

The Mexican Constitution, amended in December 2013, states that the planning and control of the
National Electrical System (SEN), as well as the energy distribution and transmission public service are
competency of the Government of Mexico. Power generation, excluding nuclear, is open to private
investment, as well as power sales to the end users.

The transmission and Distribution networks (T&D) will remain under State ownership as regulated
activities, but the Mexican Government may grant service contracts to private companies, creating
opportunities to participate in the construction, operation and maintenance of T&D infrastructure.

The Electricity Industry Law (Ley de /a Industria Eléctrica - LIE) regulates activities in the electricity
sector in Mexico. According to the LIE, the private companies can now generate and sell electricity
under an organised Wholesale Electric Market, and also invest in transmission and distribution
infrastructure, under specific Public-Private Associations and other legal structures described therein.

From the regulatory side, three agencies will have primary responsibility for the sector. The Energy
Secretariat (“SENER’) will have the policy function; the Energy Regulatory Commission (“CRE”) will
have the regulatory function; and the National Energy Control Center (“CENACE”), a new decentralized
agency, will manage the power grid and the wholesale electric market.

2. Energy Secretariat

As part of the Energy Reform, the Energy Secretariat (Secretaria de Energia - SENER) has been
empowered to coordinate the centralised planning and coordination of the energy policy, both for
hydrocarbon and electric subsectors. SENER is also in charge of guaranteeing the implementation of
the laws derived from the reform including the LTE issued recently for the transition to clean energy and
emission reduction.

During the first half of 2015, SENER issued the mandatory requirement of Clean Energy Certificates
(CECs) for year 2018, with a target of 5% of the total consumption. In March 2016, it established a target
of 5.8% for 2019. Penalties for non-compliance with the requirements of CECs have been issued.

During the second half of 2015, SENER issued the Wholesale Electric Market guidelines and called for
the first long term auction for CECs, capacity and energy; eleven companies awarded contracts to
develop more than 1.8 GW of new solar and wind capacity.

Through the first half of 2016 SENER called for the second long term auction, and twenty three
companies were awarded contracts to develop 2.8 GW of the renewable capacity; the energy-CECs
cost was 30% lower than the first auction.

Regarding the coordination and planning of the National Electric System, SENER has issued, in 2015
and 2016, the yearly versions of the National Electric Grid Development Programme (Programa de
Desarrollo del Sector Eléctrico Nacional - PRODESEN) including projections of power generation,
demand and infrastructure requirements from 2016 to 2029.

3. Regulatory Body

As part of the energy reform in Mexico, the country enacted the Regulatory Body Law in August 2014.
The regulatory bodies in charge of coordinating activities in the energy field are the National
Hydrocarbons Commission (Comisién Nacional de Hidrocarburos - CNH) and the Energy Regulatory
Commission (Comisién Reguladora de Energia - CRE).

CRE and the CNH are the two most relevant regulatory authorities in the energy sector. They have their

own legal status, budget, technical and governance autonomy. Both commissions have a similar
governance authority of seven commissioners and an executive secretary.

254 | ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 60 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

CRE has existed since 1995 as a public body with power and authority to grant permits and issue
administrative provisions in the fields of electricity, gas transport and some regulated tariffs for natural
gas and liquefied petroleum gas.

As a result of the Energy Reform, CRE’s field of authority was expanded significantly, to transportation
and commercialisation of hydrocarbon and derivatives, such as gasoline, petrol, diesel fuel oil, etc.

Regarding the electricity sector, the main faculties of CRE are to define terms and conditions of auctions
and bidding processes; to supervise the wholesale market operation; to authorise the contract and
auction models; to regulate reliability, capacity requirements and operational costs; to determine the
regulated tariffs and contract models for services involving transmission, distribution and basic supply
of electricity, to authorise models related to technical specifications for connecting power stations and
users, intelligent networks, etc. Other roles of CRE include granting permits to market participants and
the CECs registry as well as to resolves controversies and to enforce fines related to non-compliance
of market participants.

Regarding the hydrocarbon sector, the CRE regulates and promotes the development of transportation,
storage, distribution, compression, liquefaction and regasification activities of all hydrocarbons.

The CNH has the fundamental task of regulating and supervising the exploration and extraction of
hydrocarbons. It is responsible for the promotion, tendering and undersigning of contracts for this
activity.

4. National Agency for Energy Control

Mexico created the National Agency for Energy Control (Centro Nacional de Control de Energia -
CENACE) as a decentralised public body with authority to perform the operational control of the National
Electricity System and the wholesale electric market. CENACE has full autonomy and acts under the
authority of SENER and CRE, in order to control the participation of generators and suppliers in the
market; acquire and provide electricity and capacity under competitive basis; and summon and manage
the auctions of capacity, energy and CECs.

CENACE guarantees open access to the transmission and distribution facilities to all market
participants, public and private.

Additionally, CENACE also operates and oversees the preparation of proposals for planning and
expansion of the entire national electricity grid through its development programme (PRODESEN),
which is then supervised and issued by SENER and thereafter by CRE.

During the first half of 2015, CENACE received from CFE all the relevant assets related to its roles,
issued its internal organisational by-laws, delivered the draft of the PRODESEN to SENER and issued
the first version of interconnection criteria.

During 2016, CENACE launched the first phase of the Wholesale Electric Market, conducted the second
auction for CECs, Clean Energy and Capacity and issued the first result of the Capacity Balance Market
process.

5. CFE’s Law

The CFE’s Law, issued in August 2014, states that CFE becomes a productive state-owned production
company wholly owned by the Federal Government. The new CFE has budgetary and governance
autonomy, with Board of Directors formed by members of the incumbent secretariats (SENER, Treasury,
etc.) and independent board members. This law aims to regulate the organisation, administration,
operation, control, evaluation and accountability of CFE and to establish the special regime for
productive enterprises subsidiaries and subsidiaries, compensations, acquisitions, leases, services and
works, assets, liabilities, state dividend, budget and debt.

255 / ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 61 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

The new CFE will operate though separate affiliated companies that will participate in generation,
transmission, distribution and supply, so that other parties will have open access to the grid and levelled
play roles for the wholesale electricity market. In the second half of 2016 CRE assigned CFE’s electric
power plants through its six different generation companies. Also, CFE informed that its transmission,
distribution and domestic supply affiliated companies are already working independently.

During 2016, CFE performed the legal separation and asset restructuring, and cautiously commenced
the operation of the newly created subsidiaries as separated entities in the wholesale electric market.
The process was significantly delayed, especially due to the complexity of the asset, labour and
management separation.

A very significant success of CFE during 2016 was the renegotiation of the Labour Union Contract,
which significantly reduced the burden of the pension liability in CFE’s Balance Sheet.

6. Transmission and Distribution

As ruled by the LIE, the Mexican Government will continue performing electric transmission and
distribution (T&D) as a strategic regulated public service through state-owned production company CFE,
or its subsidiaries. CFE’s legal separation allows to create these entities as regulated open access
companies. The LIE provides opportunity for T&D activities and related services to be subcontracted
with private companies through public-private agreements, so that financing, installation, maintenance,
management, operation, expansion, rehabilitation, surveillance and preservation of the required
infrastructure can be performed as services provided to the T&D regulated companies.

One of the key elements in this matter is the implementation of a high voltage direct current transmission
line that will connect Ixtepec (one of the most important renewable energy generation zone in Mexico)
with the central area of the country; the bidding request and the preliminary bidding package was issued
in the last quarter of 2016.

7. Generation and Retail

The LIE provides that generation and retail can be performed by any private or public entities subject to
the compliance of permitting and market rules. Generation plants 0.5 MW or larger require a permit from
the CRE.

These are two types of permits required for electric retail: 1- basic supply with regulated tariff (for those
consumers with a lower demand of 1 MW from August 2016) or 2- qualified supply through the wholesale
electricity market at liberalized conditions for consumers with a demand of 1 MW or upper.

SENER may revise and reduce the threshold of 1 MW for the possibility of qualifying consumers for the
liberalised conditions. However, becoming a qualified consumer is optional, only mandatory for new
costumers.

8. Geothermal energy

The Geothermal Energy Law regulates the exploration and use of underground geothermal resources
to generate electricity. The private sector can participate through auctions to obtain exploitation rights
of geothermal resources. Additionally, the National Water Law was also amended in order to provide
special status to the “geothermal water” compatibly with the explotation of your thermal resources under
the Geothermal Energy Law.

9. Wholesale electricity market
The wholesale electric market commenced operation during January 2016 as provided under LIE. It is
a nodal marginal price market operated by CENACE, where generators, suppliers and qualified

costumers of the electric energy can interact to buy and sale the energy, capacity, ancillary services,
CECs and financial transmission rights in Day Ahead, Hour Ahead and Real Time.

256 / ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 62 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

The Market Rules are still being developed and issued. The Market Basis were issued during 2015, and
based on them, several Manuals have been issued, such as: the Manual for Long Term Auctions, the
Manual for Short Term Energy Market, the Manual for Registration of Market Participants, the Manual
for Financial Transmission Rights, the Manual for the Market Information System, the Manual for the
Capacity Balance Market and the Manual for Distributed Generation.

10. National content

The LIE does not demand a minimum percentage of national content in the infrastructure of the Electric
Industry. However, it points out that SENER will establish the minimum percentages and other
conditions for national content in terms of the contracts it generates. The Secretary of Treasury will
establish the criteria to measure and the targets of domestic content levels for the electricity sector.

11. Surface use and occupancy

The LIE provides that transmission and distribution, being for public service, must be treated as strategic
activities in terms of rights of way. This allows greater access to the facilities and rights of way to the
national electricity grid. The CRE will issue provisions that will secure access to the power lines and fair
compensation to the land owners.

12. Previous regime for permits, plants and electric industry contracts

All the permits and contracts granted and executed under the previous Public Power Service Law (Ley
del Servicio Publico de Energia Eléctrica - LSPEE) will remain under the same terms and conditions,
and can be amended as provided there. Once the market starts operating, the holders of these legacy
contracts - self supply and Independent Power Producers (“IPP”) have the alternative to migrate partially
or completely to the new LIE. Existing IPP will remain in effect to the end of their contractual term prior
to the migration and Legacy Connection Contracts (Contratos de Interconexién Legados - CIL) of the
self-supply projects will not be renewed upon their termination.

Permit requests for self-supply, co-generation, small-scale production, imports or exports made before
August 2014 were resolved under the LSPEE terms and conditions, provided that the facilities under
such permits must start operation before 31 December 2019.

13. Electricity tariffs

The transition of CRE as the new entity responsible of issuing the regulated electricity tariffs (transport,
distribution, basic supply and last reserve supply) is still in progress, mainly delayed by the legal
separation of CFE and the complexities of the cost allocation associated with it. All the Regulated Tariffs
issued during 2015 and 2016 are portions of the additive regulated tariff yet to be totalized. The principle
of the new tariffs is to be based on the recovery of all generation costs, connection services, transport
and distribution costs, clean energy certificates and other recoverable costs and collection targets.

It is expected that these tariffs will use similar formulas related to the previous regime during a transitory
period from 2016 to 2018.

As the main mechanism to promote the reduction of non-technical losses arising from customer’s fraud,
CRE has imposed collection targets on the T&D companies.

14. Natural Gas Transportation System
As part of the Energy Reform, the former owner of the Natural Gas Transportation System, PEMEX,
has been split in the following subsidiaries: Pemex exploration and production, Pemex industrial

transformation, Pemex perforation, Pemex logistics, Pemex co-generation and services, Pemex
fertilisers and Pemex ethylene, as provided under the PEMEX Law enacted in August 2014.

257 | ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 63 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

This law transformed PEMEX into a state-owned production company which performs business
activities and aims to profitability goals. Concurrently with this transformation, the natural gas
transportation system was transferred from PEMEX to CENAGAS, the National Operator of the Natural
Gas Pipeline Grid in order to promote an open market for its transportation, distribution and
commercialisation. According to the principle of asymmetrical regulation, PEMEX cannot integrate
transportation and commercialisation of gas under the same company anymore.

CENAGAS has issued the 5 year strategic natural gas development programme. CENAGAS formally
started to operate during 2016.

As part of the programme to reduce fuel oil consumption, CFE called for several bidding processes to
contract natural gas transportation services from pipelines to be owned by private companies. The
majority of these pipelines will be operational by 2018, thus increasing the natural gas fired power
generation, and reducing COz2 emissions from the fuel oil based generation. Simultaneously, the
Government is promoting multiple gas pipelines intended to expand the existing gas transportation
system through CENAGAS.

The natural gas transport and storage systems incorporated into the new integrated tariff scheme must
meet the criteria of forming part of an interconnected system, thus providing benefits, improving the
safety, continuity, redundancy levels and efficiency of integrated systems.

The Legacy Transportation Permits (permits given before the electric reform) for self-supply and the
long term natural gas supply contracts with Pemex required by the electric plants will remain in effect
and will not be adversely affected by these changes in the regulatory framework.

During the second half of 2016 CENAGAS was empowered to conduct the future bidding processes for
natural gas transportation auctions, (no longer CFE or Pemex). Additionally, all capacity rights of the
SISTRANGAS were transferred to CENAGAS to control manage.

SENER issued a Public Policy to create a Natural Gas Open Market by 2018, in order to promote new
players and to reduce the role of Pemex in the commercialization.

As part of this public policy, CENAGAS issued an Open Season for Transportation Capacity in the
SISTRANGAS, which will grant firm capacity rights to the winning bidders for year 2017 and will help to
identify the sections that need to be expanded in the future. The Open Season is for all the capacity
available that has not been reserved or contracted under pre-existing long term supply agreements.

4.6 Industry regulation in Brazil

1. Tariffs

Electricity distribution activity carried out by joint ventures, such as Companhia de Eletricidade do
Estado da Bahia, S.A. (COELBA), Companhia Eletricidade do Rio Grande do Norte, S.A. (COSERN),
Companhia Energética de Pernambuco, S.A (CELPE) and Elektro Electricidade e Servigos, S.A.
(ELEKTRO), which operate in Sao Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul, is subjected to federal regulation in
Brazil.

The Brazilian regulatory framework is based on a system of price cap that is revised every four or five
years, depending on each company’s concession contract and is updated annually by the regulator.
COELBA and COSERN have a five-year term and CELPE and ELEKTRO have a four-year term.

Tariffs are updated annually by the Electric National Energy Agency (Agéncia Nacional de Energia
Elétrica - ANEEL), through the annual adjustment process that considers inflation, an ex-ante efficiency
factor and variations on non-manageable costs components, such as energy purchase costs and
transmission tolls.

258 / ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 64 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

Tariffs have two components:

- Plot A: corresponding to energy purchases, power transmission services contracts and to
other costs that are out of a distributor company administration and passed through to the
end tariff.

- Plot B: determined as the sum of (i) the return on the non-depreciated regulatory
remuneration base (regulatory WACC applied to the replacement cost of non-depreciated
distribution installations and other assets), (ii) the return on capital (a depreciation index
applied to the gross asset base) and (iii) the operation and maintenance expenses, and the
expense for the uncollectible turnover (the regulator defines late payment rates depending
on the kind of grant). This last subcomponent is calculated through a benchmarking model
which compares all power distributors in the country and determinates efficient cost levels.

In June 2014, ANEEL opened the first debate on the Fourth cycle of tariff review in a public hearing,
discussing proposals to change the methodology used to calculate operating costs, cost of capital
(WACC), regulatory asset base (RAB), along with uncollectable revenues and distribution losses.

In May 2015, methodologies dealing with Fourth tariff review cycle were approved and applied to
ELEKTRO in its tariff review in August 2015. The main points, in summary, are:

- WACC: approved regulatory WACC for Fourth cycle is 8.09% real after taxes. This is higher
than Third cycle’s 7.5%.

- OPEX: The OPEX to be used in the first year of the cycle was confirmed and represents a
positive margin to efficient companies.

- Non-technical losses: In the case of efficient companies, the target will be defined by the
historical average instead of the historical minimum.

- Uncollectable revenues: benchmarking approach defines the uncollectable, wherein it is
used the bad debt database of 49-60 months. Pass through of uncollectable revenues
related to sector fees and tariff flags revenues. The result represented an improvement from
what was proposed.

- Third-party assets (special obligations): inclusion of a fee to operate third-party assets.
This is an important improvement compared with previous cycles.

- X Factor: The approved X factor for the sector is 1.53% (versus 1.91% from ANEEL’s first
proposal).

- Regulatory Asset Base (RAB) and Non-Electrical Assets: The new methodology for
RAB was not applied in ELEKTRO’s review but will be applied to NEOENERGIA’s
distribution companies. According to the new methodology, the values of assets’ additional
costs and minor components are now given by a reference price database. Also, non-
electrical assets’ methodology had a data update and it is expected to better reflect
companies’ costs.

On 25 August, ANEEL approved ELEKTRO’s Fourth tariff review, which raised its tariffs in 4.2% on
average (0.68% for residential clients and 9.32% for industrial clients). Some highlights of Fourth cycle
are: all investments made were recognized in the RAB, higher remuneration rate (from 7.5% to 8.09%,
after taxes), positive OPEX margins, third party asset’s remuneration and smaller X factor.

The aim of the annual review is to ensure that component A’s costs are passed on to consumers and
that component B’s costs perform in line with inflation and with the pre-determined efficiency factor. An
annual tracking account mechanism is used to register component A’s unbalances, which should be
passed through to tariffs in the following tariff process.

259 / ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 65 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

Also regarding distributors’ financial exposure due to a rise in costs in early 2015, an extraordinary tariff
review occurred in order to preserve financial and economical balance.

On 23 August 2016, ANEEL approved ELEKTRO’s annual review, which decreased its tariffs in -13.40%
on average (-12.28% for residential clients and -15.02% for industrial clients). The main highlights
concerned the reduction of component A’s in -4.53%, due to CDE charge decreasing, once the
hydrological situation got better in comparison to 2015, and Itaipu power purchase tariff reductions.
However, component B had an increase of 9.11%, adjusted by IGP-M inflation index minus X factor.

2. Energy Purchase

For the business of power generation, the review of the sector model introduced in 2004 brought new
guidelines for planning responsibilities and expansion generation fleet, significantly reducing risk of
further rationing. This expansion is being pursued via public tendering of generation projects in which
the successful bidder is the supplier that offers the lowest price in Brazilian Reals per MWh generated,
in exchange the successful bidder is awarded a concession or permit of 20 to 35 years (depending on
the technology) to operate a power station under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) at a price that is
an outcome of the tender.

Since 2013, Brazil has undergone some important structural changes in electricity regulation.

In Law 12.783 (the former Provisional Act 579) of 11 January 2013, the Federal Government made
official a decrease in electricity tariffs (which led to an extraordinary tariff revision applied on 24 January
2013) and established standards for the renewal of concessions for generation, transmission and
distribution expiring between 2015 and 2017. This law allowed power companies to extend their
concessions by early renewal of their contracts under specific conditions. As a result of these new rules
some generators decided not to renew their concessions. The energy from generators that decided to
renew concessions was allocated to Distribution System Operators (DSOs) through quotas, which,
however, were not sufficient to meet market needs. Additionally, some PPAs from new energy auctions
were suspended or postponed due to delay of construction schedules or revocation by ANEEL.

Thus, mismatches between energy requirements (load) and resources (PPAs) led DSOs to purchase
energy in the spot market, raising their costs and significantly affecting their cash flow. In addition,
hydrologic conditions have been unfavourable since the final quarter of 2012, with low reservoir levels
together with poor performance of rainfalls and inflows, which increased substantially the spot price and
thermoelectric generation. The corollary was a significant increase in energy costs, which temporarily
impacted earnings of distributors.

Part of this rise in costs was compensated for using funds managed by Government through energy
development account and by means of loans underwritten by various financial institutions, centralised
in ACR (Account for Regulated Environment) Accounts. These resources were approximately BRL
10,000 million to cover non-recurring expenses incurred in 2013 and BRL 18,800 million to cover those
during 2014. The remaining part of non-recurring costs, which wasn’t covered by these funds, was
passed through to consumers in the annual adjustment of the tariffs.

These financial resources helped to minimise distributors’ liquidity problems in 2013 and 2014, but
according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), DSOs were not allowed to recognise
regulatory assets and liabilities on their balance sheets. ANEEL therefore opened Public Hearing
61/2014 to discuss whether distributors' concession agreements should be amended allowing the
compensation of regulatory assets and liabilities at the end of the concession period, in order to allow
its recognition in the distributors’ financial statements. This amendment was signed by distributors in
November 2014, and these assets and liabilities are presently recognised according to IFRS.

During Public Hearing 64/2014, ANEEL discussed quotas allocation criterion, regarding the energy from
generators whose concessions had expired. Federal Decree 7805/2012 established the allocation of
new energy quotas in conformity with the size of the market (except the allocation that happened in
2013, which didn’t follow this guideline in order to achieve equal tariff reductions between DSOs). As a
result, ANEEL approved an allocation criterion that favours exposure to the spot market in 2015 but that
follows the proportion of market size in the following years.

260 / ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 66 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

In 2015, minimum and maximum limits for spot prices were changed, after discussion within the Public
Hearing, these values went from BRL 15.62 and BRL 822.83 per MWh in 2014 to BRL 30.26 and BRL
388.48 per MWh in 2015. This change allowed a significant reduction in the exposure of DSOs’ cash
flows.

After great tensions related to the lack of rainfall in 2014 and early 2015 (which raised the imminent
possibility of rationing), storage reservoirs, especially in Southeast and Midwest, were able to recover
and close the month of November at 27.55% of capacity, well above the recorded for the same period
of 2014. The year's closing forecast is 33.8% of its capacity.

Despite improved hydrological conditions, economic slowdown observed for three consecutive quarters
had significant negative effects on the distribution market. Given that prospects for 2016 are a negative
growth of Brazilian GDP, it is expected that the decline in the energy sector’s market continues,
especially affected by the drop in industrial demand. Thus, the distributors are facing a plausible
scenario of overcontracting (above 105%) for the next year. By December 2013, all energy contracts for
the year 2016 had already been carried out with completely different projections of the ones checked
today, and therefore variations on events outside the managerial scope of distribution combined with
unfavourable market conditions have resulted in overcontracting (despite the Company's efforts to
mitigate them). The main factors responsible for this scenario are the quotas, migration of potentially
free and special customers to free market and other variations resulting from higher market fall than
frustration of the energy auctions. Once DSOs have identified difficulties, negotiations have started with
MME and ANEEL to counteract the unmanageable effects and neutralize the risks.

In 2016, with political crises and the Impeachment process occurred against former President Dilma
Rouseff, the economic situation deteriorated, and the country faced a drop on GPD of -4.0% in the third
quarter and an increasing on inflation indexes, such as IPCA and IGP-M. However, by the end of the
year, after Michel Temer became president, IGP-M and IPCA had a recover, but GPD is still expected
to decrease considering the whole year. These conditions contributed to a drop on energy consumption,
worsening distributors overcontracting situation. Elektro surplus position was above 105% that are
covered by tariffs. Many actions were taken to mitigate this position in 2016 together with ABRADEE
and ANEEL that are listed as following:

- As aresult of a Public Hearing 04/2016 that discussed energy surplus due to quotas’ contracts,
any quota’s volume above reposition volume should be considered as involuntary contracting,
which mitigated the over-contracting regarding this issue, reducing Elektro exposure in 6.9%.

-  ANEEL announced the result of the Public Hearing 085/2013 that dealt with the reduction of
distributors (Power Purchase Agreements — PPAs) due to the migration of special customers to
Free Energy Market, and approved the reduction of future PPAs due to the migration of special
customers.

- Possibility to sign Bilateral agreements between distributors and generators, with temporary
suspension of PPAs.

- Minister of Mines and Energy published the Decree n° 8.828, which suspends the requirement
to replace the minimum contracted amount for overcontracted distributors. The measure
provides more flexibility to them, since now overcontracted distributors will not be penalized if
they do not purchase energy to replace contracts about to expire. For Elektro, there will be direct
impacts from 2020 onwards (once we have quotes already allocated in this replacement).

- Elektro and ABRADEE are discussing with ANEEL, as an extension and consequence of

Decree 8.828, an adjustment in calculation of “quotas step”, considering that overcontracted
distributors are no longer penalized for not purchasing the replacement amount.

261 / ro) IBERDROLA

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

- In August, the Chamber of Electricity Trading (CCEE) started the execution of New Energy
Relocation Mechanism (MCSD Energia Nova) that enables the overcontracted distributors to
negotiate contractual reductions with generators. There were already processed three
mechanisms for 2016, with supply period of July to December, August to December, and
October to December. The results of these three processing allowed Elektro to reduce 2.3% of
its energy surplus.

- Retroactive reprocessing of MCSD Energia Nova for the months of July and August 2016,
allowing the participation of generators that could not participate previously. The result is
expected to be release in February 2017.

In addition, there are other actions that still depend on publication of resolution by ANEEL and MME,
and the expectation is that it would be published by the beginning of 2017:

- Consider overcontracting related with the migration of special clients to free market in 2016 as
involuntary.

- Adequate the tariff calculation of overcontracting not to consider the amounts of energy
contracted by distributors with Belo Monte power plant, once they have delayed the delivery of
energy due to problems during the power plant construction.

Beyond the actions mentioned for 2016, there is an action plan to mitigate overcontracting expected to
2017: (1) conversion of capacity contracts into reserve energy contracts; (2) physical guarantee revision
of power plants that sell their energy in quota’s; (3) possibility to sell interruptible energy with discount;
(4) New MCSDs Energia Nova and bilateral agreements; (5) energy trade between distributors and free
consumers (allowed by Law 13.360/2016).

After Michel Temer took place as President, many reforms were proposed in order to recover the
economy and investor confidence, such as the approbation of public expenses reduction plan.
Additionally, in the power sector, were announced the privatization of Eletrobras distributors, which are
expected to be concluded by the end of 2017. However, the CELG’s auction was already concluded on
30 November, after the first attempt got frustrated, and the purchase price reduced from 2,800 million
to 1,700 million. The winner was the Italian company ENEL, which presented the only proposal, with a
goodwill of 0.5 billion.

In October 2016, the transmission auction was also concluded, and 21 from 24 enterprises were
contracted. This was possible after ANEEL changed the rules of interest rate of annual allowed revenue
(RAP), considering that the first edition of this auction, before Michel Temer’s assumption, had only 10
from 24 enterprises contracted.

The GPD expectation for 2016, according to Focus market expectations report on 30 December, is a

retraction of -3.49%. For 2017, is expected an increase of 0.5%, and IPCA inflation index is expected to
reduce to 4.87%, almost reaching the target of 4.5%.

3. Other Regulatory Changes

On 29 December 2014, by virtue of Resolution 4947/2014, the introduction of the system of tariff flags
was approved starting in January 2015. The procedure provides for short-term adjustments to be made
to tariffs through the use of triggering indicators in the energy cost component in final tariffs. Tariff flags
are determined on a monthly basis and their purpose is to mitigate the exposure of distributors' cash
flows to high energy prices by reducing the difference between the price paid for energy by distributors
and the price paid by consumers to distributors through tariff. A green flag signals low energy purchasing
costs and does not change tariffs paid by consumers. A yellow flag signals that power generation costs
are rising due to use of thermal energy in the generation mix and leads to a BRL 25 MWh increase in
price. A red flag signals a situation where the costs of providing electrical utilities are becoming even
more expensive due to the use of inefficient thermal power stations and results in a BRL 55 MWh
increase in tariff. The values of each tariff flag are revised annually or when necessary. In December
2015, since the most expensive thermal plants were shut down, therefore lowering generation costs,
ANEEL ruled that red flag would have its additional cost divided in two levels, in which level 2 adds BRL
55 MWh and level 1 adds BRL 45 MWh. From April to December 2016, except for November, it was
applied green flag, with no additional value to the tariff.

On 27 August 2015, the Public Hearing to set ABRACE’s associates’ tariffs (Brazilian Large Industrial
Energy Consumers and Free Consumers Association) was opened. CDE (“Conta de Desenvolvimento
Energético”) charge is calculated proportionally to the level of consumption for all the consumers, which
means that the largest consumers pay consequently more. ABRACE disagrees with CDE’s calculation
method and has won an injunction that allows the association not to pay a part of the charge. The result
of this Public Hearing will not have impacts in ELEKTRO’s results, but is a temporally cash flow
mismatch. On 24 September 2015, ANEEL’s board meeting discussed the results of the Public Hearing.
ANEEL’s decision is to publish the new tariff value of ABRACE’s associates according to what the
injunction determines. The impacts will be retroactive to the injunction date; 3 July 2015. ANEEL is trying
to revert the judicial decision. ABRADEE (Brazilian Electricity Distributors) has filled an injunction in
order to protect distributors from any effects. There is still no judicial decision; therefore ABRACE’s
injunction is still in play. In December 2015, ABRADEE won the injunction to allow distributors to
discount from CDE quota the amounts uncollected by the new tariffs published.

In June 2016, ANACE’s associates (National Energy Consumers Association) won another injunction,
which took effect since January 2016 that discharge then to pay CDE. On 12 June 2016, ANEEL
published Dispatch 1576, regulating the operationalization of the process and allowing distributors to
discount of CDE the uncollected revenues since the beginning of ABRACE’s injunction effect, in 3 July
2015.

With regard to the sub-transmission assets transfer, in 2015, a Public Hearing was opened in order to
collect subsidies from agents to the proposal designed by ANEEL. However, the proposal placed by
ANEEL displeased many of the agents involved, and there is still strong resistance to the transfer by the
transmission agents. In 2016, the Public Hearing came to a second phase, with a new proposal, less
wide than the previous one and easier to be implemented. It is still pending ANEEL’s final position about
the subject.

On 24 May 2016, ANEEL opened a public hearing to propose an amendment to the concession contract
of the distributors who still have not renewed its concession, under the terms of the Law n° 12.783/2013,
such as Elektro. ANEEL claims that the newly approved rules for Tariff Adjustment processes are more
adequate and, if the concessionaire agrees, the agency can allow the signature of an addendum that
incorporates these changes into the concession contract. By the proposal, only the economic clauses
regarding distribution tariffs would be discussed. Some proposed changes are:

- The substitution of the IGPM index for the IPCA when updating Parcel B (distribution costs).

- Full neutrality on Parcel A (power purchase and grid costs and regulatory charges), and the
migration of the bad debt allowance from Parcel A to Parcel B.

- Extension of the Tariff Revision interval to 5 years.

On 6 September 2016, ANEEL opened another public hearing to discuss improvement of the tariff
procedures to be applied to distributors which already renewed their concessions and to companies that
choose to adhere to the tariff terms of the new contract. The goal is to define the methodology and
formulas of the new tariff calculation rules (PRORET).

In July 2016 ANEEL published a public call for the strategic Research & Development Project entitled:
“Improvement of the power sector's business model”. The proposal aims to review and discuss the
sector's market and business model as a whole. The Project is expected to begin in 2017 and finish in
the middle of 2018. Elektro demonstrated interest and is participating together with ABRADEE Institute.
Bain & Company was chosen by the R&D participants to development, and COELBA will be the project
coordinator (Elektro was not eligible, once it has already coordinated a Tariff Structure Strategic R&D in
2014). The project of development was already sent to ANEEL evaluation, and is expected to begin in
March 2017.

On 6 September 2016, ANEEL approved the regulation for the white hourly tariff for low voltage clients.
This allows different tariff prices for customers, and stimulates consumption out of peak hour. The
application depends on voluntary adhesion by consumers. The application of white tariff to interested
consumers will start in January 2018 and will be gradually applied to customers until 2020.

On 5 October, the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) opened a Public Consulting aiming to gather
agents’ perceptions about the free market environment. MME wants to analyze the impacts concerning
market liberalization, such as: population information about the subject, whether binomial tariffs are a
requisite to its expansion, possible changes in contracts between generators and distributors and needs
of improvement in the current regulation, among others.

On 18 November, the Provisional Measure 735 was converted into Law 13,360 by President Michel
Temer. The main changes established are:

- From May 2017, the managing role of the CDE, the RGR (Global Reversion Reserve) and the
CCC (Fuel Consumption Account) will be transferred from Eletrobras to CCEE (Chamber of
Electricity Trading).

- The apportionment of CDE quotas between distributors will gradually adjust from 2017 to 2030,
when the quotas will finally be apportioned proportionally to each distributor's energy market.

- Alters CDE’s allocation between clients: Consumers with Social Energy Tariff (low income
consumers) won't pay the charge, and Medium and High Voltage clients will pay gradually less
each year.

- Increases in Itaipu’s Tariff: The additional cost that was paid by the National Treasure to
Paraguay for its energy surplus will now be included in the tariffs.

- Grants permission for distributors to negotiate their energy surpluses with free clients: still must
be regulated by MME and ANEEL;

- Allow the transfer of control of the company instead of concession termination in certain cases
- this should facilitate the privatization of Eletrobras’ distributors and the sale of Abengoa’s
assets;

- New generation projects could sell energy in A-5 and A-7 auctions.

- Existing generators can participate in new energy auction until two years after construction.

- For delay in the beginning of operation in generation and transmission enterprises, there is the

possibility of extending the contract in case of excluding of responsibility. The law defines which
causes could be classified as excluding of responsibility.

Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

The changes established by Law 13.360 still depend on regulation by ANEEL, and most of the rules will
be applied in 2017. There is no impact to Elektro, although this changes could cause an increase of
tariffs to consumers.

5. MAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

5.1 Risk Management System

The IBERDROLA Group is exposed to various inherent risks in the countries, industries and markets in
which it operates and the businesses it carries out, which could prevent it from achieving its objectives
and executing its strategies successfully.

The Company's Board of Directors, aware of the importance of this matter, promotes the necessary
mechanisms so that the risks relevant to all of the Group's activities and businesses are appropriately
identified, measured, managed and controlled, and has established, through the Group's general risk
control and management policy, the basic mechanisms and principles necessary for the appropriate
management of risk-opportunity with a level of risk which allows:

- attain the strategic objectives formulated by the Group with controlled volatility;

- provide the maximum level of assurance to the shareholders;

- protect the results and reputation of the Group;

- defend the interests of shareholders, customers, other groups interested in the progress of the
Company, and of the society in general; and

- ensure corporate stability and financial strength in a sustained manner over time.

For the development of the aforementioned commitment, the Board of Directors and its Executive
Committee have the cooperation of the Audit and Risk Supervision Committee, which, as a consultative
body, monitors and reports upon the appropriateness of the assessment system and internal control of
significant risks, acting in coordination with the audit committees existing in other companies of the
Group.

Every action aimed at controlling and mitigating risks will consider the following basic action principles:

a) Integrate the risk-opportunity vision into the Company’s management, through a definition of the
strategy and the risk appetite and the incorporation of this variable into strategic and operating
decisions.

b) Segregate functions, at the operating level, between risk-taking areas and areas responsible for
the analysis, control, and monitoring of such risks, ensuring an appropriate level of independence.

c) Guarantee the proper use of risk-hedging instruments and the maintenance of records thereof as
required by applicable law.

d) Inform regulatory agencies and principal external players, in a transparent way, regarding the
Group risks and the operation of the systems developed to monitor such risks, maintaining
suitable channels that favour communication.

e) Ensure appropriate compliance with the corporate governance rules established by the Company
through its Corporate governance system and the update and continuous improvement of such
system within the framework of the best international practices for transparency and good
governance, and implement the monitoring and measurement thereof.

265 / ro) IBERDROLA

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

f) Act at all times in compliance with the law and the Company’s corporate governance system and,
specifically, with the values and standards of conduct established in the Code of Ethics, and
pursuant to the principle of zero tolerance of illegal acts and fraud set forth in the Crime Prevention
and Anti-Fraud Policy.

The Control and risk management general policy and its basic principles are implemented by means of
a comprehensive risk control and management system, supported by a Corporate Risk Committee and
based upon a proper definition and allocation of duties and responsibilities at the operating level and
upon procedures, system methodologies and tools suitable for the various system stages and activities
including:

a) The ongoing identification of significant risks and threats based on their possible impact on key
management objectives and the financial statements (including contingent liabilities and other
off-balance risks).

b) The analysis of such risks, both at each corporate business or function and taking into account
their combined effect on the Group as a whole.

The establishment of a structure of policies, guidelines, and limits, as well as of the
corresponding mechanisms for its approval and implementation, which effectively contribute to
risk management being performed in accordance with the Company's risk appetite.

d) The measurement and controlling of risks by following procedures and standards which are
homogeneous and common to the Group as a whole.

e) The analysis of risks associated with new investments, as an essential element of decision-
making based upon profitability-risk.

f) The maintenance of a system for internal controlling of compliance with policies, guidelines and
limits, by means of appropriate procedures and systems, including the contingency plans
needed to mitigate the impact of the materialisation of risks.

g) The periodic monitoring and control of profit and loss account risks in order to control the
volatility of the annual income of the Group.

h) The ongoing evaluation of the suitability and efficiency of applying the system and the best
practices and recommendations in the area of risks for its eventual inclusion in the model.

i) The audit of the system by the Internal Audit.
In addition, the Control and risk management general policy is further developed and supplemented by
the Risk corporate policies and the Risk specific policies established in connection with certain
businesses and/or companies of the Group, which are listed below and are also subject to approval by
the Company's Board of Directors.

The Control and risk management general policy, as well as the Summary of the corporate risk policies
and the Summary of the Risk specific policies for the various businesses of the Group are available on
the corporate website (www.iberdrola.com).

In order to align the risk impact with the established risk appetite, the Executive Committee of the Board
of Directors, acting at the proposal of the business or corporate divisions involved and upon a prior
report from the Group’s Risk Committee, annually reviews and approves specific guidelines regarding
the Group’s risk limits.

Pursuant to established guidelines, the competent administrative bodies of each company of the Group,
within such company’s area of responsibility, reviews and approves the specific risk limits applicable to
each of them.

The companies and corporate functions of the Group are responsible for implementing, within their areas
of activity, the control systems required for compliance with the Control and risk management general
policy and with the limits thereunder.

The risk factors to which the Group is generally subject are listed below:

a) Corporate Governance Risks: the Company assumes the need to safeguard the social interest
of the Company and the strategy of sustained maximisation of the economic value of the
Company and its long-term success, in accordance with social interest, culture and the Group’s
corporate vision, taking into account the legitimate public and private interests that converge in
the conduct of all business activities, particularly those of the various stakeholders and
communities and regions in which the Company and its employees act. A fundamental
requirement for the foregoing is compliance with the Company's Corporate governance system,
comprising the By-Laws, the Corporate policies, the internal corporate governance rules and
the other internal codes and procedures approved by the competent decision-making bodies of
the Company and inspired by the good governance recommendations generally recognised in
international markets.

267 | ro) IBERDROLA

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

b) Market risks: defined as the exposure of the Group’s results and equity to changes in market
prices and variables, such as exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices (electricity, gas,
COz emission rights, other fuel, etc.), prices of financial assets and others.

c) Credit risks: defined as the possibility that a counterparty fails to perform its contractual
obligations, thus causing an economic or financial loss to the Group. Counterparties can be final
customers, counterparties in financial or energy markets, partners, suppliers, or contractors.

d) Business risks: defined as the uncertainty regarding the performance of key variables inherent
in the business, such as the characteristics of demand, weather conditions, the strategies of
different players, and others.

e) Regulatory and political risks: defined as those arising from regulatory changes made by the
various regulators, such as changes in compensation of regulated activities or in the required
conditions of supply, environmental regulation, tax regulation including risks relating to political
changes that might affect legal security and the legal framework applicable to the businesses
of the Group in each jurisdiction, the nationalisation or expropriation of assets, the cancelation
of operating licenses and the early termination of contracts with Government.

f) Operational, technological, environmental, social and legal risks: defined as those related to
direct or indirect economic losses resulting from inadequate internal procedures, technical
failures, human error, or as a consequence of certain external events, including the economic,
social, environmental, and reputational impact thereof, as well as legal and fraud risks. The said
risks include those associated with information technology and cybersecurity, as well as the risk
of technological obsolescence, among others.

g) Reputational risks: potential negative impact on the value of the Company resulting from
Company’s behaviour below the expectations created among various stakeholders:
shareholders, customers, media, analysts, Government, employees, and society in general.

Due to its universal and dynamic nature, the system allows for the consideration of new risks that may
affect the Group as a consequence of changes in its operating environment or revisions of objectives
and strategies, as well as adjustments resulting from ongoing monitoring, verification, review and
supervision activities.

The Audit and Risk Supervision Committee of the Board of Directors periodically monitors the evolution
of the Company's risks:

- It reviews the Group’s risk quarterly reports, which include monitoring compliance with risk
limits and indicators and updated key risk maps, submitted by the Group’s director of
corporate risks.

- It coordinates and reviews risk reports sent periodically, at least semi-annually, by the audit
and compliance committees of the main subsidiaries of the Group, being included the
subholding companies of the main countries where the Group operates that, along with the
tisk director appearances are used to prepare a risk report for the Board of Directors at least
twice per year.

For further details, see the section Control systems and risk management of the Corporate Governance
Report 2016.
5.2 Credit risk

The IBERDROLA Group is exposed to credit risk arising from its counterparties (customers, suppliers,
financial institutions, partners, etc.) default on their contractual obligations. The exposure may arise with
regard to unsettled amounts, the cost of substituting products not supplied and also, in the case of
dedicated plants, outstanding amounts.

268 / ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 74 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

The credit risk is managed and limited in accordance with the type of transaction and the
creditworthiness of the counterparties. A specific corporate credit risk policy is in place which establishes
criteria for admission, approval systems, authorisation levels, scoring tools, exposure measurement
methodologies, etc.

With regard to credit risk on trade receivables, the historical cost of defaults has remained moderate
and stable at close to 1% of total turnover of this activity, despite the current difficult economic
environment. Regarding other exposure (counterparties in transactions with financial derivatives,
placement of cash surpluses, transactions involving energy and guarantees received from third parties),
no significant defaults or losses were incurred in 2016 or 2015.

At 31 December 2016 and 2015, there is no significant credit risk concentration in the IBERDROLA
Group.

5.3 Financial risks
5.3.1 Interest rate risk

The IBERDROLA Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates affecting cash flows and
market value in respect of items in the balance sheet (debt and derivatives). In order to adequately
manage and limit this risk, the IBERDROLA Group manages annually the proportion of fixed and
variable debt and establishes the actions to be carried out throughout the year: new sources of financing
(at a fixed, floating or indexed rate) and/or the use of interest rate derivatives.

Debt arranged at floating interest rates is basically tied to Euribor, Libor-GBP and Libor-USD and to the
most liquid local reference indexes in the case of the borrowings of the Latin American subsidiaries.

The debt structure at 31 December 2016, once considered the hedge provided by the derivatives traded,
is included in the Note 5 of the Consolidated financial statements.

5.3.2 Foreign currency transaltion risk

As the IBERDROLA Group's presentation currency is the euro, fluctuations in the value of the currencies
in which borrowings are instrumented and transactions are carried out with respect to the euro, mainly
the Sterling Pound, the US Dollar and the Brazilian Real, may have an effect on the finance costs, profit
and equity of the Group.

The following items could be affected by foreign currency translation risk:
- Collections and payments for supplies, services or equipment acquisition in currencies other

than the local or functional currency.

- Income and expenses of certain foreign subsidiaries indexed in currencies other than the local
or functional currency.

- Debt denominated in currencies other than the local or functional currency of the IBERDROLA
Group companies.

- Profit or loss on consolidation of foreign subsidiaries.
- Consolidated carrying amount of net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The IBERDROLA Group reduces this risk by
- Ensuring that all its economic flows are carried out in the currency of each Group company,

provided that this is possible and economically viable and efficient, through the use of
derivatives if not.

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

- As far as possible, this covers the risk of transfer of earnings scheduled for the current year,
thereby limiting the ultimate impact on Group earnings.

- Mitigating the impact on the consolidated net asset value of a hypothetical depreciation of
currencies due to Group’s investment in foreign subsidiaries by maintaining foreign currency
debt, as well as through financial derivatives.

The debt structure at 31 December 2016, once considered the hedge provided by the derivatives traded,
is included in the Note 5 of the Consolidated financial statements.

5.3.3 Liquidity risk

Exposure to adverse situations in the debt or capital markets or in relation to the IBERDROLA Group's
own economic-financial situation may hinder or prevent the IBERDROLA Group from obtaining the
financing required to properly carry on its business activities.

The IBERDROLA Group’s liquidity policy is aimed at ensuring that it can meet its payment obligations
without having to obtain financing under unfavourable terms. For this purpose, various management
measures are used such as the arrangement of committed credit facilities of sufficient amount, deadline
and flexibility, diversification of the coverage of financing needs through access to different markets and
geographical areas, and diversification of the maturities of the debt issued.

The sum of cash, liquid assets and committed undrawn credit facilities would sufficiently cover the
Group's expected liquidity requirements for a period of over 24 months, excluding the arrangement of
any new credit.

The figures relating to changes in the Company's debt are included in Notes 25 and 50 to the
Consolidated financial statements.

5.4 Country risk
The activities of the different businesses that the IBERDROLA Group developed are submitted, in
greater or lesser extent depending on their characteristics, to various risks inherent to the country where
they operate:

- Imposition of monetary and other restrictions on the movement of capital

- Changes in the trade environment

- Economic crisis, political instability and social riots affecting operations

- Nationalisation or expropriation of assets

- Exchange rate fluctuations

- Cancelation of operating licenses

- Anticipated termination of Government contracts

- Changes to administrative policies and regulations in the country

The results of our international subsidiaries, their market value and their contribution to the Group may
be affected by such risks.

270 / ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 76 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

The IBERDROLA Group's main operations are focused on Spain, United Kingdom, USA, Brazil and
Mexico, countries with low or moderate risk, whose credit ratings are as follows:

Country Moody's S&P Fitch
Spain Baa2 BBB+ BBB+
United Kingdom Aat AA AA
USA Aaa AA AAA
Brazil Ba2 BB BB
Mexico A3 BBB+ BBB+

The presence in countries other than the ones mentioned above is not significant at Group level from
an economic point of view.

5.5 Activity risks

The activities of the various businesses developed by the IBERDROLA Group are subject to various
risks including market, credit, operational, business, regulatory and reputational risks arising from the
uncertainty of the main variables that affect them.

5.5.1. Regulatory and political risks

Companies in the IBERDROLA Group are subject to laws and regulations concerning prices and other
aspects of their activities in each of the countries in which they operate. The introduction of new laws
and regulations or amendments to the already existing ones may have an adverse effect on the Group’s
operations annual results and economic value of businesses.

The following paragraphs are a few of the new major regulatory measures that were approved in 2016
or are due to be implemented in 2017:

Spain:

- Approval on 17 June 2016 of the Order IET/980/2016 establishing remuneration for electricity
distribution companies in 2016, stipulating total remuneration for the Iberdrola Group of EUR
1,655 million (up by 2.7% against 2015) and a regulatory asset base (RAB) for the Group's
distribution assets of EUR 8,694 million, thereby removing any uncertainty.

United Kingdom:

-  Pulication of the final report and conclusions of the Competition Market Authority (CMA) about
the gas and electricity retail market analysis in UK with moderate impact for Scottish Power. Its
main measures include:

o The application of a price cap for prepaid customers.

o The creation of a database shared with customer information in order to encourage
competition.

o The elimination of certain tariff limitations.

- Economic, political and regulatory uncertainty arising from the outcome of the referendum on
the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, held in June 2016.

United States:

- Approval of rate cases by the regulator of the Estate of New York RG&E and NYSEG, valid from
July 2016 for a period of three years, in satisfactory terms for the Company.

271 / ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 77 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

- The approval in the United States of the new tax incentive scheme for the development of
renewable energy Production Tax Credits, valid until 2020.

Brazil:

- Approval of Elektro’s four-year tariff review, by the Brazilian regulator ANEEL, valid up to August
2019, in satisfactory terms for the Company.

Mexico:

- Possible impact on the Mexican economy of some of the new political and economic measures,
announced during the recent election campaign in the US, by the new Trump administration,
such as the introduction of trade tariffs.

- Uncertainties about the Energy Market Reform currently being drawn up which, according to
the best information available, could affect the profitability of assets dedicated to selling
electricity to private partners and the outlook for plants currently under construction.

5.5.2 Network business risk

The regulations of each country in which the IBERDROLA Group's network businesses operate
establish regularly revised frameworks, guaranteeing that these businesses will receive reasonable and
predictable returns. These frameworks include penalties and bonuses for efficiency, service quality and,
eventually, for default management, which have a minor, immaterial impact overall. Significant structural
amendments to these regulations could supose a risk to these businesses.

In general, the profitability of the IBERDROLA Group's network businesses is not exposed to demand
risk, except for the Brazilian subsidiaries.

The IBERDROLA Group's network businesses in Spain and in the United Kingdom are not exposed to
any market risk associated with energy prices.

The network businesses in Brazil and some of the businesses in the USA sell energy to regulated
customers at a price determined by certain previously approved tariffs. In the case of a prudent
procurement management and as established by the regulator, the regulatory frameworks in both
countries guarantee sums will be collected in subsequent tariff readjustment reviews for possible
purchase price deviations from those previously recognised in the tariff.

Given the above, in the case of extraordinary events (extreme drought in Brazil as happened in 2014,
catastrophic storms in USA, etc.), occasional temporary gaps between payments and collections may
arise with an impact on the cash flows of some of these businesses and eventually on profits recognised
under IFRS.

- Spanish Networks:

The present regulatory model is based on Electric Industry Law 24/2013 of 26 December, establishing
regulatory six-year periods and profitability for distribution activity calculated as the yield on government
bonds plus 200 basis points. Profitability was set at 6.5% for the first regulatory period.

The Royal Decree 1048/2013 of 27 December establishing the methodology to calculate remuneration
for electricity distribution activities defines a methodology based on standard unit costs of investment
and operation. The remuneration of facilities will be calculated on the basis of the real audited cost and
the standard cost recognised for each investment, and therefore profitability will depend on the
constructive efficiency achieved.

In terms of distribution incentives, the Royal Decree 1048/2013 modifies the definitions of current quality
incentives and losses, and establishes a new anti-fraud incentive.

Moreover, in accordance with current regulations, the distribution company does not sell any energy to
customers, and it is therefore not exposed to market risk at the present time. This means that fluctuations
in demand have no direct impact on the income statement.

- United Kingdom Networks:

The group operates in the United Kingdom through its subsidiary Scottish Power Ltd and the following
licences:

- SP Distribution PLC (SPD)
- SP Manweb PLC (SPM)
- SP Transmission PLC (SPT)

The current regulatory model for SPD and SPM is based on the RIIO ED1 framework, and on the RIIO
T1 framework in the case of SPT. The latest tariff review for electricity distributors (RIIO ED1), including
SPD and SPM, is valid from April 2015 to April 2023. The SPT review (RIIO T1) is valid from April 2013
to April 2021.

The weighted average cost of capital or WACC is set for each tariff period. The current real WACC after
tax recognised for distribution activities was 3.4% from January to March, and 3.67% from April to
December. In the case of transport business it was 4.27% from January to March, and 4.46% from April
to December.

The regulator (OFGEM) also establishes incentives/penalties for safety, environmental impact,
consumer satisfaction, social obligations, connections and quality, which may have an effect on the
income statement.

- United States Networks:

The Iberdrola Group operates in the USA through its listed subsidiary Avangrid, which in turn has the
following subsidiary network companies:

- New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG), New York, with a 3-year rate case valid until 2019
(base ROE 9% for distribution).

- Rochester Gas and Electric (RG&E), New York, with a 3-year rate case valid until 2019 (base
ROE 9% for distribution).

- Central Maine Power (CMP), Maine, conducting electricity distribution business with an annual
extendable rate case (base ROE 9.15% for distribution), and transmission business (base ROE
10.57%).

- United Illuminating (UI), Connecticut, conducting electricity distribution business with a rate case
currently undergoing an advanced review, and transmission business (base ROE 10.57%).

- It also has the following natural gas distribution companies: Maine Natural Gas Corporation
(MNG), Connecticut Natural Gas (CNG), Southern Connecticut Gas (SCG) and Berkshire Gas
(BG).

Companies carrying on regulated business in the USA are exposed to risks associated with the
regulations of a number of federal regulatory bodies (FERC, CFTC, DEC) and state commissions,
responsible for establishing the regulatory frameworks of the companies regulated (tariffs and other
conditions).

The distributors’ tariff plans have been designed to reduce the risk to which business is exposed through
mechanisms for deferral, reconciliation and provisions for costs. Regulated distributors pass on the costs
of gas and electricity to end customers, thereby mitigating any impacts of fluctuations in demand.

- Brazilian Networks:

The Iberdrola Group conducts its network business in Brazil through Elektro Redes, S.A. in the state of
So Paulo, and the network business of its investee Neoenergia (39% Iberdrola Group), which has the
electricity distributors Coelba, Celpe and Cosern in the respective states of Bahia, Pernambuco and Rio
Grande do Norte.

Brazilian legislation applicable to regulated electricity distribution business establishes two types of
costs: i) “Parcel A”, which includes the costs of energy, transport and other obligations and regulatory
charges, which can be recovered through tariffs (“pass through”) as part of the conditions and limits
imposed by ANEEL, except for other obligations and regulatory charges which can always be recovered
through tariffs, and ii) “Parcel B’, which includes remuneration for investment and the costs of operation
and maintenance, which generate either an incentive or a risk for the investor.

ANEEL also acknowledges other smaller incentives to minimise default and impairment of quality and
customer satisfaction that can affect the income statement.

Pursuant to current legislation, electricity distribution companies:

a) transfer the cost of supplying electricity to the end customer through the regulated tariff,
provided the energy contracted is between 100% and 105% of the demand required.

b) risk penalties imposed by the regulator ANEEL, when this is less than 100% due to the exclusive
responsibility of the distributor.

c) risk price fluctuations when it is above 105%.

The dates of the next tariff reviews are as follows: Elektro: August 2019, Celpe: April 2017, Coelba
and Cosern; April 2018.

5.5.3 Renewables business

The regulations of each country in which the Group operates establish regulatory frameworks aimed at
promoting the development of renewable energies based on formulas which may include premiums,
green certificates, tax or regulated tariff deductions, which allow investors to obtain sufficient and
reasonable return. Any change to the aforementioned regulation may represent a risk for said business.

In addition to the aforementioned regulatory risk, Group’s renewable energy businesses may be subject,
to a greater or lesser extent, to wind resource risk and market risk.

The Group considers that the wind resource risk is mitigated through the high number of wind power
farms available and their geographic diversification, and the trend to compensate less wind energy
periods with those with high wind energy on the medium term.

Regarding the electricity price risk the following should be mentioned:

- Renewables business — Spain

The Group currently has a renewable installed capacity in Spain of: 5,507 MW wind farms, 303 MW mini
hydro, 50 MW solar thermal and 0.09 MW photovoltaic.

Subsequent to the approval of the new regulatory framework (the Royal Decree-law 9/2013, of 12 July,
Law 24/2013, of 26 December, the Royal Decree 413/2014, of 6 June, and the Ministerial Order

274 | ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 80 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

IET/1045/2014, of 16 June), all renewable energy generated is remunerated at market price plus a
premium per MW. This guarantees a reasonable regulated return based on a recognised standard
investment. This return is readjusted every three years within predetermined bands to cover any
possible deviation in market price. This premium per MW is not applicable for wind farms brought on
line during and before 2004. As a result, initially all output would be fully or partially exposed to market
risk.

- Renewables business — United Kingdom

The Group's current renewables installed capacity in the UK is: 1,619 MW in onshore wind plants and
195 MW in offshore wind plants, operational under current “Renewables Obligation” legislation. This
means that income is partially exposed to the risk of the market price for electricity in the UK, as the
revenues obtained comprise income from the price of the energy produced and the sale of renewables
obligation certificates (ROC certificates).

UK regulations impose minimum ROC obligations per MWh sold on sellers of electricity, 10% more than
the system envisages producing, and determine the price at which the rest must buy, which in practice
amounts to a floor price at the price of the ROCs.

New renewable technology plants, implemented as of 2016 and 2017 (onshore wind plants,
implemented sicne 12 May 2016, and the rest as of 1 April 2017), are subject to the new “Contract for
Difference” remuneration scheme, or CfD, which eliminates market risk for 15 years.

The fixed prices for these projects are established on a project-by-project basis through public tenders.
The counterparty guaranteeing this price, “The Low Carbon Contracts Company”, finances its potential
payments by charging a fee to distributors depending on their market share, and therefore the credit risk
with the counterparty is practically zero.

The East Anglia offshore plant, currently under construction, has been awarded a CfD contract.
German offshore wind plant

The renewables division in the UK also manages offshore wind business in other European
countries, among which the Wikinger offshore plant (Germany), currently under construction.

Pursuant to German regulations, the new Wikinger plant will have a fixed price for the energy it
produces over the first 15 years of operation on a CfD contract, similar to the aforementioned setup
in the UK.

The positions exposed to market risk of the renewables businesses in Spain and the UK are managed
and included in their position in the Deregulated businesses in these countries, to be hedged in the most
efficient manner possible.

In relation to electricity price risk in other countries, mention should be made of the following:

- Renewables United States

The Iberdrola Group conducts its renewables business in the US through its listed company
Avangrid, which has an installed capacity of 5,588 MW in onshore wind plants, and 50MW in
operational photovoltaic plants.

At the present time, approximately 67% of the energy produced is sold on fixed-price long-term
contracts with third parties, and some 33% of the energy produced is sold to the market on more
short-term arrangements.

With electricity prices around USD 30 per MWh, a 5% change in prices could give rise to an impact
of EUR +8 million on operating results.

275 | ro) IBERDROLA

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

- Renewables Mexico

In Mexico the business now has an installed capacity of 367 MW in operational onshore wind plants,
with two sale schemes: a) fixed-price sale to the CFE on a long-term contract and b) sale to third
parties with a discount on the official price published by the CFE.

- Renewables Brazil

In Brazil the business now has an installed capacity of 187.3 MW in onshore wind plants, all
operating on long-term contracts (PPAs) with a fixed price for the country's distributors. Excesses
and shortages in the production contracted with the distributor are settled over periods of four years,
and excesses must be offered and shortages purchased at market prices.

- Renewables business in other European countries

Installed capacity is currently 615 MW in wind plants and 6.17 MW in photovoltaic facilities
operational in Greece, Portugal and other European countries.

Regulations in these countries make a distinction between two energy sale schemes: sales at the
tariff (Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Hungary), or sales at market price plus green certificates (Italy
and Romania).

5.5.4 Deregulated electricity and gas generation and retailing businesses Commodity price
risk

The activities of the Group's deregulated businesses are subject to a range of market, credit, operating,
business and regulatory risks, coming from the uncertainty of the main variables that affect them, such
as: fluctuations in commodity prices, changes in hydroelectric and wind energy production (of both the
Group's and of third parties), changes in electricity and gas demand, and plant availability.

The main variable that affects IBERDROLA’s result in terms of raw materials’ market price is the
electricity price. However, in many countries, electricity prices are strongly correlated with the price of
the fuels used in its production. Therefore, risk studies are carried out on fuel price trends.

In the case of fuel and COz emission allowances, these risks are evident in:

- The electricity generation and retailing business, in which the IBERDROLA Group is
exposed to variations in the price of COz emission allowances and in the sale price of
electricity, as well as to variations in fuel costs (mainly gas and coal).

- The gas retailing business, in which a large portion of the IBERDROLA Group's operating
expenses relate to the purchase of gas for customer supplies. The IBERDROLA Group is
therefore exposed to the risk of variations in the price of gas.

- Unhedged energy transactions (discretionary trading).

To a large extent, the mutual closing out of positions by the generation business and retailing business

mitigates the market risk to which the Group is exposed. The remaining risk is mitigated by diversifying
sale and purchase agreements, and specific clauses therein, as well as by arranging derivatives.

276 | ro) IBERDROLA

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

- Deregulated business in Spain

Commodities’ Price risk

Given current market conditions, the production price of the coal-fired power plants defines, to a large
extent, the price of electricity in Spain since coal is the marginal technology necessary to cover electricity
demand. Consequently, the price of coal conditions revenues from the other less expensive
technologies which are used to cover demand. With coal prices around USD 68 per tonne, a 5% change
in the prices could give rise to an impact of EUR +15 million on operating results.

The price of COz influences the cost of production in coal-fired power plants. With coal prices around
EUR 4.85 per tonne, a 5% change in the prices could give rise to an impact of EUR +3 million on
operating results.

The majority of gas supplied in Spain is paid indexed to the price of oil by means of complex formulas.
IBERDROLA has these types of agreements for the supply of gas, as well as other types of fixed-price
supply and with prices not indexed to the market price of oil. These agreements are used for electricity
generation, for the consumption of its final customers and for sale to other intermediaries. Due to the
fact that the electricity generation margin is covered by the contracting formulas of the system operator,
only residual risk remains in sales to final customers and third parties. The risk assumed is reduced and
depends on the correlation between the price of oil and the European and international gas prices. In
the event of a 5% fluctuation in the oil price, the risk would be EUR +1 million.

Hydraulic risk

Despite having a large water storage capacity, IBERDROLA's results depend significantly on the flow
contributions. The changes in output with respect to the average value can be up to -4,000 GWh ina
dry year and +5,000 GWh in a wet year, the variability would be between EUR +135 million. The loss of
profit is not covered as it is an IBERDROLA’s inherent risk.

Demand risk

Given the current market condition, where price is primarily determined by the generation cost of coal-
fired plants, which make up around 15% of the generation mix, it is not considered that demand
fluctuations will impact on marginal technology in the market. The impact on the market price of a 1%
change in demand is therefore limited, amounting to approximately EUR 0.25 per MWh.

A moderate drop in demand in Spain does not affect the scheduled output of the Group's nuclear,
hydroelectric and wind power plants, since there is a mandatory electricity market in Spain guaranteeing
the efficient dispatch of output from all technologies.

Nevertheless, there could be an impact if a drop in electricity demand entails an equivalent reduction in
the Group's retail sales and consequent narrowing of margin. This is mitigated to some extent by
increasing sales of own energy on the wholesale market.

Taking both effects into account, it is estimated that a 1% fluctuation in demand would have an impact
of EUR +8.5 million overall.

Operational risk

From the perspective of its impact on business results, the main risk arises from nuclear power plant
outages (due to stoppages for fuel reloading, in accordance with a pre-established schedule) and
hydroelectric power plant outages which are not associated with a large storage reservoir (flow facilities,
in which water is not storable). As a result of such outages, production and, therefore, the margin
associated with this production are lost. This risk is managed through excellence in the operating and
maintenance practices of the plants and a culture focused on total quality and the reduction of
operational risks, which allow the impact of this risk to be kept low.

277 | ro) IBERDROLA

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

- Deregulated business — United Kingdom

Commodity price risk

The IBERDROLA Group does not count on having coal plants in the UK after the closure of current plant
Longannet at the end of March 2016.

In the British market, geared towards thermal power generation, the clean spark spread has become
the appropriate index to follow the uncertainty of the margins of coal-fired power plants. Despite the fact
that commodities (coal, COz and electricity) are listed separately, the uncertainty of the unit margin is
studied since it has been detected that it is a better indicator of the uncertainty of the results. With clean
spark spread levels around GBP 3 per MWh, a 5% change in the spreads could give rise to an impact
of EUR 5 million on operating results.

The IBERDROLA Group does not already have long-term gas contracts at fixed price.
Demand risk

Electricity consumption demand is usually one of the most significant risk factors for any company.
However, IBERDROLA currently purchases from third parties a significant portion of the energy it sells
(1,800, 2,500 and 4,100 GWh in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of a total amount of electricity sold
of 22,000 GWh/year), since it is more profitable to do so under current market conditions than
IBERDROLA producing it and using its own thermal power plants. From a business perspective,
fluctuations in electricity demand mean that additional amounts of electricity need to be purchased or
that these acquisitions need to be reduced. In any case, the profit or loss IBERDROLA obtains from this
intermediation is low and much lower than that obtained from its own output. Thus, demand fluctuations
have a small impact on profit or loss of EUR +10 million for every 1% fluctuation in customer demand.

Operational risk

From the perspective of its impact on business results, the main risk arises from the combined cycle
power plants outages. With regard to these outages, all profit or loss obtained from production is
committed, although the high operating and maintenance standards of the plants and a culture focused
on total quality and the reduction of operational risks, allow the impact on this risk to be kept low. Loss
of profit from this type of events (material damages or machinery malfunctions) is covered by an
insurance policy after a certain deductible level, which is marked by the risk retention level that
IBERDROLA can assume and the insurance conditions that the market offers for risks of these types.

- Deregulated business — Mexico

Commodity price risk

Electricity generation at Iberdrola Generacién Mexico is gas-intensive. Gas prices therefore comprise
an essential component of this risk.

Approximately 83% of the electricity generated in Mexico is sold through long-term sales agreements
(to CFE and, to a lesser extent, other major industrial customers), whereby the risk associated with the
price of gas for generating this electricity is passed on.

The remaining energy is sold to customers at a price linked to the official tariffs published by CFE. These
tariffs depend on the price of various fuels, specially fuel-oil, diesel, natural gas and coal.

As a result, there is a risk associated with the price of these fuels on the international markets, which is

properly managed through operations in derivatives markets. These operations reduce the risk, with a
lower final risk as a result.

278 | ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 84 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

- A5% change in fuel-oil or diesel prices (which are closely linked) would give rise to a EUR +3
million change in results.

- A5% change in the natural gas price would give rise to a EUR +1 million change in results.

- A5% change in the price of coal would give rise to a EUR +1 million change in results.
Demand risk

The structure of the agreements IBERDROLA has entered into in Mexico isolates the business results
from electricity demand fluctuations. Revenues come mainly from plant availability and only the sales
indexed at the official Mexican tariff are subject to a certain extent by the fluctuation in demand.
Nonetheless, most of the plants have committed sales exceeding their production capacity and therefore
a shift in demand would not have an impact on their operations or results as the electricity generated
would be sold to another customer. Changes in electricity demand in Mexico therefore have no effect
on results.

Operational risk

From the perspective of its impact on business results, the main risk arises from combined cycle power
plant outages. With regard to these outages, all profit or loss obtained from production is compromised,
although the high operating and maintenance standards of the plants and a culture focused on total
quality and the reduction of operational risks, allow the impact of this risk to be kept low. Loss of profit
from this type of event (material damages or machinery malfunctions) is covered by an insurance policy
after a certain deductible level, which is marked by the risk retention level that IBERDROLA can assume,
and the insurance conditions that the market offers for risks of these types.

- Deregulated business — United States and Canada

Commodity price risk

IBERDROLA's business in the United States and Canada is geared towards natural gas transport and
storage. As a result, the risk assumed mainly arises from fluctuations in the price of natural gas over
time. There is no risk arising from the price levels but rather from the difference in the price of natural
gas between the period of high prices (winter) and the period of low prices (summer). In the event the
difference between both periods is USD 0.21 per MWh, if the aforementioned difference were to
fluctuate by 5%, the uncertainty of the results would be EUR +1 million.

Operational risk

The business's gas storage facilities are exposed to operational risks associated with outages impeding
the injection or extraction of gas, gas storage leaks and shifts in geological structures that hinder
recovering injected gas.

IBERDROLA mitigates such risk by conforming to the highest standards of predictive and corrective
maintenance, and permanently monitoring the geological parameters of the storage facilities. This will
enable it to respond quickly to any potential threats that may be identified.

- Gas supply operations

The IBERDROLA Group maintains an adequate balance in the global mix, both in terms of the number
of supplier countries and the type of supply (gas via pipelines or GNL), which is demonstrated in that it
has five suppliers from different areas (Norway, Nigeria, Algeria and Qatar, among others).

In the Spanish case, gas supply is guaranteed through long-term agreements. The 23% of this mix of

agreements is at a fixed price and the remainder is linked to the prices of various fuels on international
markets.

279 | ro) IBERDROLA


--- Page 85 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

Gas supply in Mexico is secured through long-term agreements with PEMEX and CFE at a price linked
to international natural gas prices in the US and, therefore, with price that depends on the same gas
prices in that country.

The gas business in the United States and Canada involves natural gas storage, whereby net gas
purchases are not necessary over and above the fuel needed for the transfer, injection and extraction
thereof. These quantities are small and procured gradually on local gas markets without the existence
of long-term supply agreements.

- Unhedged energy transactions (discretionary tradin:

Discretionary trading of electricity, gas, emissions allowances and other fuels and associated products
performed by some of the Group's businesses is residual and the overall risk thereof is mitigated using
individual stop-loss limits, whose total aggregate can never exceed 2% of the Consolidated net profit for
the period, pursuant to the market risk policy approved by IBERDROLA, S.A.'s Board of Directors.

IBERDROLA has reduced discretionary trading in recent years in line with the widespread move away
from market speculation. At 31 December 2015, the notional value of derivatives used in speculative
trading (calculated in accordance with the criteria set forth in the European Market Infrastructure
Regulation (EMIR)) was below EUR 135 million versus EUR 135 million at 31 December 2015. In any
case, these values are much lower than EUR 3,000 million thereshold that is set for non-financial
companies in the European regulation (EMIR).

5.5.5 Other operational risks

During all of the IBERDROLA Group’s activities, direct or indirect losses may arise as a result of
inadequate internal procedures, technical failures, human error or external factors.

Any of these risks could cause damage or destruction to the IBERDROLA Group's facilities, as well as
injuries to third parties or damage to the environment, along with the ensuing lawsuits, especially in the
event of power outages caused by accidents at our distribution networks and possible penalties imposed
by the authorities.

Although many of these risks are unpredictable, the IBERDROLA Group mitigates them by carrying out
the necessary investments, implementing operation and maintenance procedures and programmes
(supported by quality control systems), planning appropriate employee training, and taking out the
required insurance covering both material damages and civil liability.

In relation to the insurance cover, IBERDROLA has international insurance programmes to cover equity
(insurance for material damages, machinery breakdowns, loss of profits, damages from natural
disasters and risks arising from construction work) and third-party liabilities (general civil liability, liability
for environmental risks, professional civil liability, etc.).

However, this insurance does not completely eliminate operational risk, since it is not always possible,
or it is not in its interest to pass such risk on to insurance companies and, in addition, cover is always
subject to certain limitations.

Specifically, the IBERDROLA Group is also exposed to the following operational risks:

- Risk of malfunctions, explosions, fire, toxic spillages or polluted emissions in gas and electricity
distribution networks and generating plants. Risks in connection with cybersecurity. Threats or
vulnerabilities concerning data, control systems or Group information and communications
systems, and any consequences arising from access to, use, disclosure, deterioration,
interruption, unauthorised modification or destruction of information or information systems.

- Risks concerning extreme meteorological conditions and other instances of force majeure.
- Risk of sabotage and/or terrorism.

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2016

- Risks in connection with nuclear business

The IBERDROLA Group’s nuclear power plants in Spain are also exposed to risks relating to their
operations and risks arising from the storage and handling of radioactive materials.

- Constitutional Spanish law caps the liability of nuclear power plant operators in the event of a
nuclear accident at EUR 700 million. This liability for a nuclear accident must be compulsorily
insured by the operator of Spanish nuclear power plants. The IBERDROLA Group meets this
obligation by taking out Nuclear Civil Liability insurance policies for each plant. However, Law
12/2011, of 27 May, concerning civil liability for nuclear damage or damage caused by
radioactive materials, will increase the operator's liability ceiling and the consequent ceiling on
mandatory insurance to EUR 1,200 million for nuclear power plants. The law will enter into force
when all signatories of the Paris and Brussels Agreements ratify the 2004 Amendment
Protocols, as established in these agreements.

- Accordingly, it is important to point out the indirect economic risk to which the aforementioned
power plants are exposed as a result of a possible serious incident in Spain or in other country
could affect the periodic renewals of their compulsory operating licences and the increase in
their safety investments.

- Environmental risks

IBERDROLA accepts that the environment places constraints on all human activities and is a factor of
companies’ competitiveness, and it is committed to promoting innovation in this field and also
ecoefficiency, to gradually reducing the environmental impact of its activities, facilities, products and
services, and striving to ensure that its activities’ development is congruent with future generations’
legitimate right to an appropriate environment.

The Group undertakes and promotes this commitment through its policies. IBERDROLA currently has
three specific policies in order to manage environmental issues: environmental policy, anti-climate
change policy and biodiversity policy, which set forth the principles through which the Company will
continue to improve its environmental management.

IBERDROLA was also included, for the twelfth consecutive year, on the global Dow Jones Sustainability
Index, a worldwide benchmark for recognition of companies’ contributions to sustainable development,
as well as on other prestigious international sustainability indexes. It becomes the unique utility in the
index since its creation in 1999.

- Operational risk of operations in markets

Market trading conducted by the Group's various energy trading desks and treasury dealers is also
exposed to operational risk due to possible inappropriate processes, technological faults, human error,
fraud or any other external or internal event.

This risk is mitigated by following the operational risk policy when trading on the market based on a
robust risk control culture, a proper segregation of duties, the publication of clear processes and policies
and secure and flexible information systems. This policy sets specific thresholds and guidelines
applicable to all trades performed in accordance with the principle of proportionality.

- Risks in connection with cybersecurity

IBERDROLA Group companies may be affected by threats and vulnerabilities in connection with
information, control systems or information and communications systems used by the Group, or by any
consequences of unauthorised access to or the use, disclosure, degradation, interruption, modification
or destruction of information or information systems, including the consequences of acts of terrorism.

281 / ro) IBERDROLA

These risks are managed in accordance with the basic principles of the cybersecurity policy, which takes
the necessary measures to guarantee secure usage of information and communications systems and
other cyber-assets, bolstering detection, prevention, defence and response capacities to counter
cyberattacks.

5.5.6 Legal risks

The IBERDROLA Group companies are part of a certain in-court and out-of-court disputes within the
ordinary course of their activities, the final result of which, in general, is uncertain. An adverse result, or
an out-of-court resolution thereof or other proceedings in the future could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial situation, operating results and cash flows. However, the Group's legal
advisers believe that the outcome of the aforementioned disputes will not have a significant effect.

Note 43 of the Consolidated financial statements contains a more detailed description of the most
significant matters regarding “Contingent liabilities”.

6. SIGNIFICANT SUBSEQUENT EVENTS TO YEAR END

Subsequent events to year end are described in Note 50 of the Consolidated financial statements.

7. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

. Iberdrola believes that innovation is a strategic variable which affects all areas of business and
all our activities. We intend to lead innovation within the energy sector, focusing on sustainable
development, promotion of renewable energies, utilisation of the opportunities presented by
digitalisation in all areas, automation and a focus on technology and new business models. In 2016
more than EUR 211 million were invested in R+D+i, especially projects related to smart grids, clean
energy generation, offshore wind facilities and new technologies and business models. More than 200
R+D+i projects, all of which are expected to have an effect on business in the short/medium term, are
now ongoing thanks to the involvement of all Group employees.

. Thanks to a constant commitment to innovation, Iberdrola is now a world leader of the energy
sector that has kept ahead of the energy transition to address the challenges of climate change and the
need for clean energy, and has been acknowledged as Spain's most innovative utility and the third most
innovative in Europe in the European Commission's classification.

. Iberdrola Ventures - PERSEO is IBERDROLA's corporate risk capital programme for investing
in innovative technologies and business models to guarantee a sustainable energy model. On the
international front, in 2016 a Silicon Valley company known as STEM, in which Perseo holds a stake,
consolidated its position as leader of the distributed storage market, with more than 200 storage facilities
operational. A Salamanca company in which Perseo likewise holds a stake, Arborea Intellbird, is also
expanding. Arbérea uses drones to inspect all kinds of energy infrastructures, and in 2016 it embarked
upon international expansion, having surpassed the milestone of inspections of over 600 wind turbine
blades in Spain and Mexico.

Under a clear strategy, which is set out in the 2015-2017 Innovation Plan, innovation is IBERDROLA's
primary tool to guarantee the Company's sustainability, efficiency and competitiveness, focusing on
three main issues:

- Efficiency, geared towards a continuous streamlining of our operations, managing the useful
lives of facilities and equipment, cutting operation and maintenance costs, and reducing our
environmental footprint with the aim of adapting to an environment which is more and more
demanding and strives to improve constantly from the technological, processes and operations
point of view.

- New products and services, in response to customers’ needs in an increasingly global and
competitive market. These projects deploy existing technology to produce business models
offering power supply, facilities and technologies that are increasingly more efficient and
environment-friendly such as energy efficiency, electric vehicles, smart grids and distributed
energy resources.

- Disruptive business models and technologies that assist us in undertaking the energy
challenges ahead, and adapting to the changes that are arising from the electric sector. Through
PERSEO, IBERDROLA's corporate venture capital programme, we invest in new disruptive
technologies and areas of business focusing on making the energy model sustainable.

Thanks to our human and economic resources allocated to innovation (EUR 211 thousand at 2016), we
are now at the forefront of development of new products, services and business models that are
transforming the energy sector.

Some of the most innovative ventures by major area are as follows.
7.1. Renewable energies

In 2016, Innovation activities in Renewables have focused primarily on:

- Improving the efficiency of our operating assets,
- Improving the integration of renewable energies,

- Developing new designs or processes for construction in progress or for future or ongoing
projects associated with offshore wind power, highlighting the ones applicated to Wikinger
project (Germany) and East Anglia | (United Kingdom).

Efficiency improvement in Wind Farms is aimed at reducing operating and maintenance costs and
improving production.

The field of energy resources continues with the development of an internal model for the design of wind
farms based on fluid dynamics and the use of supercomputers.

The best use of the oils used in the gearbox of wind turbines is being analysed in order to extend its
useful life and optimize the maintenance operations. The company is also involved in the joint
Europe/Brazil HPC4E project (High Performance Computing for Energy) to prepare computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) for tomorrow's "exascale" supercomputers.

Extending the lifespan of facilities, reducing costs and guaranteeing reliability are other challenges which
are using large amounts of resources and labour on a yearly basis. For example, work continues on the
OLEO and MINEROIL projects for the long-term analysis of the behaviour of lubrication oils in different
models of machinery. The use of drones for visual thermographic inspections of wind turbine blades in
situ at plants ensures early detection to prevent future large-scale damage or more expensive repairs
(the Arbdrea project). Finally, in a bid to boost production without overloading certain components, an
analysis was conducted and new control strategies were implemented for wind turbines.

Among the available tools to manage the exploitation of the wind farms, it is working on the continuous
optimization of the production prediction to reduce the deviations from the actual production (Meteoflow),
and work is also being carried out to monitor the main machinery of turbines and their throughputs for
early detection of faults in components or reductions in output, through the use of artificial intelligence
and big data.

One of the projects undertaken to integrate renewable energies is ESS2Wind, which sets out to analyse
the possible application of battery storage systems for wind plants to provide them with ancilliary
services. Surveys have also been conducted on hybrid wind/solar/storage integration.

Innovation in offshore wind projects is essential to reduce costs and to limit risks in ongoing and future
projects. The piles and jacket foundations for the Wikinger offshore wind plant were assembled in 2016.
This is the first lberdrola wind plant to use this kind of foundations. The substation has a ground-breaking
design with a 6-legged jacket foundation, and it was also built in two separate blocks (to make it easier
to transport to the location), which were assembled afterwards in situ. The MARINEL project analysed
an optimised design of the location of the substation's electrical equipment, with features such as
alternatives for self-installable substations.

Work was also completed on the Flidar project, the main objective of which is to replace offshore
meteorological towers which require costly foundations for their installation with floating stations with an
alternative measuring system known as LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). Work continued to
develop the Leanwind project, the main objective of which is to reduce costs over the plant's lifespan
and the supply chain through the principles of "lean" application and the development of innovative
solutions and tools. These solutions may be applied to all kinds of offshore facilities, including those with
floating foundations, such as those being analysed in the Lifes50+ project.

IBERDROLA continues to work on the European Project Best Paths, which analyses the HVDC (High
Voltage Direct Current) multiterminal networks from different suppliers to observe interactions with
electrical equipment in wind turbines in a scenario in which offshore wind will be connected to the
network. In the same area, work started on the European project "Promotion", which seeks to develop
the technology of a number of HVDC systems (converters, protection devices and switching gear).

Finally, initiatives specifically orientated to sustainability such as BRIO project, should be highlighted,
which aims to analyse the wind farm after its useful life and the valuation of the high value-added
components of the wind turbine blades.

7.2 Clean generation technologies

During 2016, efforts in the area of generation focused on operating efficiency and _ flexibility,
environmental protection, and the improvement of plant safety.

Operating efficiency and flexibility and plant safety: Following completion of the HOREX project a few
years ago, work continued on the line of research into the chemical expansion of concrete with the
PREXES project, focusing on development of a model to predict expansion in hydraulic concrete
structures. With respect to safety at facilities, work started in 2016 on the VIDAGEN project to design
and develop a tool to manage the global lifespan of pressurised equipment, with the possibility of adding
a structural analysis module subsequently.

In the UK a project was carried out to inspect and repair low-pressure turbine rotor blades at the Rye
House combined-cycle facility, using robotised tools, and the design and installation of an uninterruptible
battery power supply system at Lanark & Galloway. Research was also conducted into pole fatigue in
the Cruachan hydraulic generator.

In the area of nuclear generation, the prominent projects are FILTRONUC and RESONUC. The goal of
this first project is to research and develop a new containment filtered venting system for maximising
filtering performance on the venting line without compromising the safety and integrity of the facilities.
The RESONUC project focuses monitoring and characterizing the resonances in critical systems to
establish a solution, thereby ensuring they perform as well as possible as a significant contributor to
nuclear plant safety and reliability.

Environmental: Iberdrola remains firmly committed to reducing the environmental impact of its
generating plants, backing an ambitious project entitled CO2FORMARE to find a solution to the problem
of macrofouling in the cooling systems of electricity generating plants in a sustainable manner and
mitigating the environmental impact both emissions into the atmosphere and the aquatic environment.

During 2016, the technical expertise generated in COEBEN-II and implemented at Velilla del Rio Carrion
served as a basis to launch the QUEMANOx and REMINOx projects, which use new designs for burners
and a combination of technologies already developed to adapt our Lada and Velilla facilities to
increasingly stringent environmental requirements, offering an alternative to high-cost commercial
solutions.

7.3. Commercial Area - New projects and services

Innovation is essential in commercial activity, in order to offer customers the products and services best
suited to their needs. Thus in 2016 IBERDROLA launched the following:

- New initiatives to boost the customer experience:

Innovative campaigns and projects were carried out in 2016, focusing on greater customisation
of contents and offers, real-time dispatch of proactive communications, and a better online self-
service, for a better and more homogeneous customer experience throughout the entire
lifespan, thereby boosting customer engagement. Some of the initiatives were as follows:

o Optimum tariff: Iberdrola advises its customers on the "Plan a Tu Medida" (Plan to Suit
You), so that they pay less when they use less power. Here Iberdrola analyses the
hourly consumptions of millions of customers to offer them the plan which best suits
their consumption, with no need to change their habits. The plans were originally
launched in 2015, and were the first plans launched in the sector to adapt the company
to customers, instead of customers having to adapt to energy offers.

o “Tu Asesor Energético" (Your Energy Advisor): this is an online portal which gives
comprehensive advice to both individuals and businesses, regardless of whether or not
they are customers, on all energy-saving aspects of power bills: optimisation of the
economic offer, power output optimisation, advice on energy savings and energy
efficiency, callback service to address any queries, and an omnichannel advice service
(website, phone and in situ channels).

- New Smart Home products: Consumption Monitors and Smart Lamps:

Iberdrola now has a range of home energy management products using facilities with an Internet
connection, providing customers with more information on the power they use, and enabling
them to manage their consumption and save energy. A smart thermostat has been available
since the beginning of 2015, and sales of the Consumption Monitor began in 2016 - this is an
electric meter which can provide a breakdown of the consumptions of the main domestic
appliances, and Smart Lamps, or smart LED bulbs which can be controlled by a mobile phone.

Iberdrola is also still involved in Green Mobility R+D+i projects, an area of business to meet the demands
of customers and society in general concerning electrical mobility. In 2016 Iberdrola continued to work
on innovation projects, among which REMOURBAN and AZKARGA. The CIRVE project also began in
2016, in which Iberdrola assists with the development of rapid-recharge infrastructure corridors for
electric cars, to boost electric mobility and connect Spain to France and Portugal.

A pilot project is ongoing in the UK to assess the benefits of using batteries associated with photovoltaic
micro-generation. Work is also being carried out to analyse customers’ consumption data to give them
energy efficiency advice and assistance. Finally, a proactive demand management programme is being
offered to larger customers. With respect to new digital products, the new PowerUp platform enables
consumers to buy gas or electricity in advance in one-day packages, one-month packages or packages
of up to 180 days, at a pre-set price.

7.4 Smart grids

Iberdrola, a leader in digitalisation and automation of assets and infrastructures, is a pioneer developer
of smart networks in Spain and Europe, with a constant commitment to safety, the environment and
better supply quality. The following are a few of the main initiatives in 2016:

In Europe, Iberdrola leads the UPGRID project, with the goal of reinforcing its capability as an integrator
of active demand and distributed generation in low voltage. The IGREENGrid project has been
successfully concluded, aimed at finding innovative solutions to integrate renewable generation in the
power distribution grid; as has been the DISCERN project, which compares different smart solutions for
the grid with a view to achieving the most optimised set of architectures. Work continued on the
GRID+STORAGE project to integrate storage solutions in electricity grids.

Spain is working on the LAYCA project to develop a system to locate breakdowns and characterise
faults in medium-voltage systems. With respect to the standardisation and maintenance of overhead
power lines, Iberdrola leads the MATUSALEN project to develop a tool which determines the aging of
voltage cables in underground lines and is a partner on the SILECTRIC project, developing new
insulators for overhead lines and high voltage switchgear. Work was completed on the TABON project
to develop a verification technology and inspection line. In terms of operational systems, work continued
on the development and validation of the new remote management system to provide immediate reliable
access to the information required, integrating a number of modules for efficient management of the
electricity grid and its meters. The BIDELEK project completed its innovative work on the development
and industrialisation of new applications and devices.

A project known as FITNESS was carried out in the UK to demonstrate a new digital substation concept,
in addition to the PHOENIX project, which aims to develop a new synchronous hybrid compensator to
enable larger amounts of renewable energy to be used in situations when conventional power production
is restricted, the POWER2TOWER project to investigate the feasibility of a system to monitor transport
networks via wireless communication towers on the supports, and the VWAM project, which analyses
virtual models of overhead power lines, developed using LIDAR technology.

Innovative projects are being carried out in Brazil in five main areas: smart systems, network quality and
reliability, safety at facilities, loss reduction and sustainability. Two of the projects to develop domestic
technology for smart networks were BID MONITOR, a backup system for decision-making concerning
sales of electricity, and CIUDADE INTELIGENTE, to implement an urban reference model based on
Smart Grids.

Initiatives in the US were deployed in the Energy Smart Community programme (ESC), which sets out
to provide an efficient connection for consumers, the local community and the market for distributed
energy resources. ESC has projects to improve efficiency, the consumer experience, smart grids and
distributed energy resources. Another project, AMI, focuses on the automation of measurement
infrastructures, while the ARIES project is an integrated overhead system to assess damage caused by
meteorological phenomena, using LIDAR technology. The use of drones to detect damage caused to
distribution and transmission lines by snowstorms is also remarkable.

Iberdrola's Technology Centre in Qatar focuses on the development of innovative solutions in three key
areas of digitalisation of the electricity system: (1) smart grid measurement and automation, (2)
integration of distributed renewable energy and (3) demand management. A number of R+D projects
were started up with local universities and research centres, and the company also entered into
consultancy projects with other electricity companies in the Middle East, transferring best practices in
the design and deployment of smart grids.
