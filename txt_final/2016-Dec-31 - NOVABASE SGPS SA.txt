NOVABASE is a listed Company since July 2000, working in compliance with a governance model regularly assessed
by the Executive Board in terms of adequacy and performance, aiming at contributing to the performance optimization
and to a more accurate alignment with all the stakeholders’ interests. The stakeholders are entities whose interests
involve the corporate activity and include Shareholders and Investors, Clients, Suppliers and other Business Partners, and
Employees.

Given the growing challenges presented by the internationalization and competiveness of NOVABASE’s activities, it
became necessary to update the corporate governance implemented in the Company, in order to simplify and promote
flexibility on the Company’s bodies and procedures and to better adjust the existing solutions to the Company’s size and
operating circumstances

Therefore, at the General Meeting held on 29 April, 2015, NOVABASE changed its Articles of Association and implemented
a reinforced Latin governance model, which integrates a Board of Directors, an Audit Board and an Effective Chartered
Accountant. In the context of this model, a more agile daily company management structure was implemented, including
two managing directors - Luis Paulo Cardoso Salvado (CEO) and Francisco Paulo Figueiredo Morais Antunes (CFO). On
the other hand, NOVABASE has a General Meeting board elected for three-year mandates, as well as a Remuneration
Committee appointed by the General Meeting that shall set the remuneration of each member of the Corporate Bodies,
considering their duties and the Companies’ economic situation. The Company also appoints a Secretary and a deputy
secretary, in accordance with article 446-A of the Commercial Companies Code, to exercise their competences under
the law.

NOVABASE continuously analyses the implementation of this model, to improve, wherever possible, its corporate
governance practices and better adjust the adopted model to the demands and challenges faced by the Company.

BUSINESS SUMMARY

The year 2016 was marked by the sale agreement
of Infrastructures & Managed Services business
CIMS Business’) to VINCI Energies Portugal, SGPS,
S.A. CVEP'’), concluded in mid-4Q16, which was an
important step in the repositioning of the businesses
that Novabase has been doing in recent years.

Novabase was already focusing its offer on services
business areas that generate more value and are less
exposed to price competition, and exiting product
areas with greater use of cash and lower added value.
On the other hand, it has also evolved its international
expansion strategy, limiting its exposure to emerging
markets and increasing its presence in Europe.

With the IMS Business sale, operation that was
substantially completed at the end of 2016, Novabase
intends to enhance internationalization with stronger
means.

RISKS

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial
risks, namely, Foreign exchange risk, Cash flow and fair
value interest rate risk, Credit risk, Liquidity risk and Capital
management risk.

The Group's overall risk management program focuses
on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks
to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s
financial performance.

a) Foreign exchange risk

The Group operates internationally and is exposed
to foreign exchange risk, mainly arising from
U.S. Dollar, Kwanza and Metical exposure, since
some subsidiaries perform transactions in these
currencies. The finance department is responsible
for the tracking of the exchange rate of the
currencies mentioned above, in order to reduce the
impact of the fluctuation in consolidated results.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to
hedge certain risk exposures.

b) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group’s interest-rate risk arises from finance
investments in banks and bonds, and borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the
Group to cash flow interest-rate risk. Borrowings
issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair
value interest rate risk.

c) Credit Risk

Credit risk is managed, simultaneously, on business
unit levels, for the amounts of outstanding trade
and other receivables, and on Group basis, for
financial instruments. Credit risk arises from cash
and cash equivalents, derivative — financial
instruments, as well as credit exposures to wholesale
and retail customers, including outstanding
receivables and committed transactions. For banks
and financial institutions, only independently well
rated parties are accepted. Credit risk management
of trade and other receivables is based in credit
limits, taking into account the financial position of
the customer and past experience.


--- Page 31 ---

Liquidity risk

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining
sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability
of funding through an adequate amount of committed
credit facilities and the ability to close out market
positions. Management monitors rolling forecasts
of the Group’s liquidity reserve @wnich comprises
undrawn mitted borrowing facilities and cash and
cash equi nts) on the basis of expected cash flows,
taking into account the analysis of the remaining
contractual maturity of the financial liabilities and the
expected date of financial assets inflows, and taking
into account the cash transfer restrictions in Angola and
Mozambique. Additionally, a regular monitoring is made
to the maturity concentration of borrowings
of the Group.

FINANCIAL AND STOCK PERFORMANCE

d) Capital management risk

The Group’s objectives when managing capital,
which is a broader concept than ‘equity’ in the
consolidated statement of financial position, are:

) To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern in order to provide returns
for shareholders and benefits for other
stakeholders;

1) To maintain a solid capital structure to support
the development of its business;

Il) To maintain an optimal capital structure
to reduce the cost of capital.
