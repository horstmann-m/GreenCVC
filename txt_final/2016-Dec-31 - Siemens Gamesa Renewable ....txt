Company’s evolution during the year

An extraordinary year in which Gamesa beats its guidance and consolidates the foundations
of its long-term strategy.

Gamesa Corporacién Tecnoldgica’ ended 2016 with record orders, sales, profitability and cash flow
generation, having beaten its guidance for the year — even after upgrading it twice.

Strong commercial activity, the result of a growth-oriented competitive position, resulted in
1,386 MW? of new orders in Q4, 33% more than in the same period of 2015, which raised order
intake in the last twelve months to 4,687 MW (+21% y/y). The order backlog stood at 3,552 MW
(+11% y/y) at the end of the year. This strong commercial performance provides a high degree
of visibility to this year's guidance (c. 5,000 MWe). Gamesa begins 2017 with orders covering 63%
of its projected sales’, similar to the position at the beginning of 2016

Revenues increased by 32% in 2016, to €4.612 billion. EBIT amounted to €477 million (+48% y/y),
and the EBIT margin was 10.4%, 11 percentage points higher than in 2015. Finally, net profit rose
by 77% y/y, to €301 million. Recognition of Adwen reduced 2016 net profit by €25 million.

Higher profitability together with focused investment in working capital, which declined by
£237 million to -4.9% of revenues, and in capex, which amounted to €211 million, enabled Gamesa
to achieve 30% ROCE and €423 million net free cash flow while maintaining its commitment to
a sound balance sheet and ending the year with a net cash position of €682 million.

Gamesa is also advancing with its long-term value-creation strategy, having signed an agreement,
approved by its shareholders on 25 October, to merge with Siemens Wind Power.

Revenues in the Wind Turbine Generator (WTC) division increased by 37% y/y, to €4,141 million,
due to growth in volume to 4,332 MWe, 36% more than in 2015. That growth was distributed over
practically all regions: Europe/RoW, Latin America, the US and India. APAC (inc. China) was the
only exception, due mainly to contraction of the Chinese market, where the pace of installations
fell from 30.5 GW in 2075 to 23.3 GW in 2016, according to the latest figures from the Global Wind
Energy Council (GWECY’.

expectations for 2016. The rising trend in the total fleet under maintenance and the post-warranty
fleet was confirmed in 2016: +16% (to 24,331 MW) and +10% y/y to 16,827 MW), respectively. This
growth was driven by expansion of the fleet in emerging markets, as envisaged in the business plan
15-17E, and by an improvement in the post-warranty renewal rate.

Growth in sales volume in 2016 was the result of the company's strang competitive positioning and
its presence in markets with above-average growth rates. Gamesa’s strong competitive position
is supported not only by a diversified geographic footprint (55 countries) but also by an extensive
customer base, a portfolio of products and services focused on maximising the return on wind
assets, and a presence throughout the wind value chain. In a year in which the pace of installations
ex-China came down from 32.5 GW in 2015 to 31.3 GWin 2016, according to the Global Wind Energy
Council (GWEC)*, Gamesa’s strong performance enabled it to increase installations in the year
by 27% to 4,262 MW, bringing its total accumulated figure to 38,875 MW by 2016 year-end, and
positioning itself in the fourth position of the worldwide’ wind ranking according to Bloomberg New
Energy Finance

Also as a result of that positioning, the company signed 1,386 MW" of orders in the fourth quarter,
33% more than in the same period of 2015 and equivalent to a book-to-bill ratio" of 1.3, exceeding
the 1.2 ratio achieved in the same period of 2015. Total order intake amounted to 4,687 MW in 2016,
equivalent to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1, and the order backlog at 2016 year-end stood at 3,552
MW, 11% more than at the end of 2015. Strong commercial performance in 2016 enabled Gamesa to
commence 2017 with a high degree of visibility with regard to its volume guidance, having attained
63% coverage” of the volume guided for 2017 (c. 5,000 MWe).

In this context of growing activity, Gamesa remains focused on controlling structural costs so as to
maintain a low break-even point. As a result, structural expenses" amounted to 7% of revenues in
2016, i. below the target set in the business plan for 2015-17E, and 0.7 percentage points lower

In addition to surpassing its financial goals for the year, during 2016 Gamesa made clear progress
with implementing its long-term (2017+) strategy by reaching an agreement to merge with Siemens
Wind Power. This merger is underpinned by a sound, strategic rationale and will combine two leading
companies that are highly complementary in terms of markets, businesses, customers, product
portfolios and operational and management capabilities. The merged company will be in a position
to offer optimal CoE to its customers and to maintain a value creation proposition for its other
stakeholders (shareholders, employees, suppliers and the communities where it operates) that is
sustainable over the medium and long term, The deal was presented to the financial markets in the
second quarter of 2016 and it was approved by Gamesa's shareholders at an extraordinary General
Meeting on 25 October, with 99.75% of the capital in attendance voting in favour. At the date of this
report, the merger had been cleared by Spain's National Securities Market Commission and all the
relevant competition authorities except that of the European Union.

Therefore, it can be concluded that, in 2016, for the second time, Gamesa fulfilled the objectives
of its business plan 2015-17 ahead of schedule, since it exceeded the 2017 financial and strategic

targets in 2016.

Main factors

Activity

In 2016, Gamesa sold 4,332 MWe, 36% more than in 2015. This trend was driven mainly by India, Latin
America, Europe & RoW, and the US; the principal customer categories were electric utilities (54% of
the total) and IPPs (35%).

Activity in 2016 was concentrated in the Gamesa 2.0 MW segment, which accounted for 98% of
total MW sold. The Gamesa G114 2.0 MW - 2.5 MW platform accounted for 55% of activity in the
period, compared with 24% in 2015, evidencing the new platforms’ growing importance. Gamesa 5.0
MW platform accounted for 1% of MWe sold in 2016.

In the services division, Gamesa had 24,311 MW under operation and maintenance, 16% more than
at the end of 2015. Growth in the fleet under maintenance came mainly from emerging markets
India and Brazil, which offset a decline in mature markets. The year end post-warranty fleet under
maintenance increased by 10% year-on-year to 17 GW.

Profit & Loss

Revenues amounted to €4,612 million in 2016, 32% more than in 2015.
This growth was due primarily to sales in the WTC division, which grew by 37% y/y thanks to a 36%
increase in activity volume with respect to 2015. As projected at the beginning of the year, average
revenues per MWe manufactured were stable in year-on-year terms. Sales of newer products, with
larger rotors and taller towers, offset the negative exchange rate effect, which reached 5% by year-

138

end, mainly as a result of depreciation of most of the emerging market currencies in which Gamesa
operates. The assembly business had a varying impact on average revenues: it was negative in the
first half of the year, when there was very little assembly work, and positive in the second half, when
assembly work recovered. Specifically, in the first half only 0.54 MW were assembled per MWe sold,
whereas the figures matched in the same period of 2015; in contrast, during the second half of the
year, assembly work amounted to 1.4 MW per MWe sold, contrasting with 11 MW in the same period
of of 2015. Overall, 4,262 MW were assembled in 2016, a 27% increase year-on-year. In the WTG
division, revenues per MWe sold are affected by many factors, including project scope, rotor size,
tower height, geography, activity scope, gearbox, etc.; accordingly, this variable is not indicative of
the level or trend of profitability.

1 ASP(E MIM): WTC revenues (€) in the period/MWe sold inthe period

Service revenues were stable in year-on-year terms, amounting to €471 million, inline with projections
for the year. That stability is a reflection of pressure on prices and a reduction in contract scope;
these trends are normal in the services business in mature markets. To offset the negative impact
of these trends, Gamesa has implemented an operational strategy to ensure absolute profitable
growth in the services division, even in a situation of flat sales, as was the case in 2016. The plan is
based on three main vectors: cost-cutting programmes, commercialisation of value-added services
in mature markets, and signing longer contracts in emerging markets. Growth in the fleet under
maintenance and the post-warranty fleet, an improvement of nearly 30 points in the renewal rate,
from 40% in 2015 to 67% in 2016, and expansion of the order book assure a return to growth in sales
in 2017, fulfilling the objectives for the division in the BP2015-17E: accumulated growth of 220% in
revenues in 2014-17, and an EBIT margin of 213%. The fleet under maintenance increased by 16%
y/y in the last twelve months, to 24,311 MW, while the post-warranty fleet expanded by 10% in the
same period, to 16,827 MW. Fleet growth is concentrated mainly in emerging markets. In line with
growth in the fleet under maintenance, the services backlog has also expanded, reaching €2,412
million at 2016 year-end, 115% more than a year earlier.

At constant exchange rates, Group revenues would have amounted to €4,818 million, i.e. 38% more
than in 2015.

139


--- Page 7 ---

In addition to attaining record revenues and commercial activity in the year, Gamesa also posted
record EBIT: €477 million. The EBIT margin was 10.4%, 1,1 points more than in 2015. EBIT performance
is attributable to:

* capital gains from the creation of the joint venture Adwen amounting to a positive €29mn (-0,8 p.p)
* the volume effect (+2.4 p.p.)

* contribution margin performance (+0.7 p.p.)

+ fixed cost performance (-1.1p.p.)

* currency performance (0.0 p.p.)

The improvement in the contribution margin in 2016 is linked to variable cost optimisation
programmes and the favourable project scope, offsetting the adverse impact of the increase in
fixed expenses needed to support growth (this increase includes an increase in depreciation and
amortization charges in line with the increase in capex), and the lower contribution by O&M to total
revenues (10% in 2016, vs. 13% in 2015).

Net financial expenses in the period amounted to €23 million (€10 million less than in 2015), while
exchange losses amounted to €15 million, compared with exchange losses of €11 million in 2015,
due to currency volatility in both periods. Financial expenses in 2016 included a negative €7 million
impact from the estimates of scenarios that remain open after Areva exercised its put option to sell
its Adwen stake to Gamesa in the context of the merger with Siemens Wind Power.

The tax expense amounted to €124.4 million, equivalent to a marginal rate of 28%, in line with 2015
and within the guidance range for the year (25%+3%)

Asa result, consolidated net profit totalled €301 million (€170 million in 2015).

The impact of the integration of Adwen at 50% in the consolidated net profit (without any impact
in free cash flow) amounted to -€25 million (-€4 million in 2015” )
Balance sheet

As reflected by the main balance sheet indicators, Gamesa maintained its commitment to a sound
financial position in a context of rising activity, while reducing warking capital by €237 million y/y to
-€225 million at year-end, and achieving a net cash position of €682 million

In 2016, in line with the modular capex strategy presented in the business plan 2015-17, Gamesa
invested €211 million in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to cater for expected
demand growth, new product launches and operation and maintenance services. In addition to RED
expenditure, Gamesa invested in logistics, tooling, and blade capacity — both new capacity and product
replacement due to the introduction and strong penetration by the G14 (2 MW and 2.5 MW) and G126
(2.5 MW) generators — in all regions where it operates.

Forecasted evolution

Positive demand prospects in the short and medium term'*

The growing number of countries that are committed to renewable energies as a means of combating
climate change, and the increasing competitiveness of renewable energy sources, including wind, lay the
foundations for strong demand prospects in the short, medium and long term.

The growing support for renewable energy sources was clearly reflected in the speed with which the
Paris Agreement, signed by 195 countries on 12 December 2015, came into force (4 November 2016),
while wind power's increasing competitiveness was evident during 2016 in the outcome of many

In terms of competitiveness®, by 2027 it is estimated that new wind installations, which are already
fully competitive in many countries, will be cheaper than coal- or gas-fired facilities in practically all
geographies, particularly if CO2 emission pricing is introduced, while by 2040 the cost of energy for
onshore wind will have declined by 41%. That reduction will be due to a number of factors: falling
equipment and development costs, low funding costs and, primarily, an increase in wind turbines’
capacity factor.

In this context of growing governmental support and wind's greater competitiveness, long-term
estimates” are that, by 2040, “clean” (i.e. zero GHG) energy sources will account for 60% of
total installed capacity, up from 31% at the end of 2015, most of the new installed capacity being
concentrated in developing (non-OECD) countries, with China and India accounting for the bulk of
new installed capacity. In those countries, economic growth and electrification are the main drivers
of growth in energy demand and investment in new generating capacity. In the period 2016E-2040E,
itis estimated that 1,825 GW of wind capacity will be installed, ie. investment totalling 3 trillion

In the shorter term, and following the slight contraction in the pace of new wind installations
worldwide (ex-China) in 2016, the short- and medium-term prospects are stable with respect to the
projections released during the year, with emerging economies and offshore as the main growth
engines. Emerging markets are expected to achieve an estimated 8.4% annual growth between
2016E and 2020E, while offshore will be the absolute leader in terms of expected annual growth:
over 38% between 2016E and 2020E, with northern European countries (mainly Germany and the
UK) and China to the fore.

2017 Guidance”: commitment to profitable growth

In this favourable demand context, Gamesa maintains its commitment to profitable growth in 2017,
the goal being to sell around 5,000 MW of wind turbines and achieve €550 million in group EBIT (a
15% increase over the 2016 figures in both cases)

The sales volume commitment is supported by the order book at 31 December 2016, which already
covered 63%” of the committed volume. Though growth is expected in most regions, it will be led
by the US and APAC, while India will continue to be the market with the largest single contribution
to the company’s top line in 2017.

As well as growth by the Wind Turbine division, Gamesa maintains its commitment to the business
plan for the Services unit, which is expected to resume revenue growth in 2017. This is already visible
in the order backlog, which rose by 11% y/y, and in the recovery in the fleet under maintenance in
2016.

The commitment to increase operating profit to c. €550 million is supported by rising sales volumes,
ongoing programmes to optimise variable costs, and strict control of structural costs, to offset
pressure from a more competitive environment.

To achieve its projected growth, Gamesa maintains its modular capex strategy, the goal being for
capex to be stable with respect to 2016 in relative terms: 4%-5% of revenues. The company also
maintains its commitment to a sound balance sheet through strict control of working capital and

Progress with the long-term value-creation strategy: Gamesa - Siemens Wind Power merger

Having secured its most immediate value-creation goals through its performance in 2016 and its
commitments for 2017, Gamesa continues to advance with its strategy to create value beyond the
current year and the business plan 2015-2017E, through the agreement to merge with Siemens
Wind Power. The merger has already been approved by Gamesa's shareholders, Spain’s National
Securities Market Commission and several other competition authorities; at the date of this report,
the only approval still pending was that of the European Union competition authorities, which is
expected in the first quarter of 2017.

As a pre-requisite for completing the merger, Gamesa purchased Areva’s 50% stake in Adwen, a
subsidiary operating in the offshore segment. The acquisition was completed in January 2017, and
‘Adwen will be fully consolidated by the merged company. Adwen has 630 MW in offshore wind
farms under maintenance and is currently building a 350 MW wind farm in Germany (Wikinger)
The company also has two product lines in the 5 MW and 8 MW categories (the latter under
development), and a backlog of 1.5 GW in projects under the French auctions. Adwen obtained €248
million in revenues in 2016 and reported an operating loss of -€41 million, attributable to its current

stage of development. At 31 December 2016, Adwen had €251 million in net debt and owed €238
million in loans to Areva,

The merger agreement will create value for all stakeholders, not just by reaping synergies but also due
to the enhanced competitive position in a changing market in which the cost of energy is increasingly
important. The merged group will be larger, with a greater scope and more diverse, a stronger balance
sheet and a more comprehensive product portfolio.

Conclusions

Ina situation of stable demand, Gamesa reported strong earnings in 2016, with record order intake,
revenues and profitability, exceeding its guidance for 2016 even after upgrading it on two accasions
during the year.

The company’s sound competitive position enabled it to end the year with 21% year-on-year growth
in order intake, to 4,687 MW, exceeding its guidance of 4 GW for the year, after signing 1,386
MW in orders in the fourth quarter, 33% more than in the same periad of 2015, This growth was
accompanied by a sizeable increase in geographical diversification. The order backlog at the end
of December 2016 stood at 3,552 MW, 11% more than a year earlier, which provides a high level of
visibility on the growth targets for 2017.

Revenues amounted to €4,612 million, 32% more than in 2015, or 38% more at constant exchange
rates®, This increase was driven by higher sales volume in the Wind Turbine division (+36%) due to
its strong competitive position and presence in geographies where the wind market is expanding
faster than the global average. As a result, Gamesa installed 4,262 MW, 27% more than in 2015, in
a context of a slight decline in worldwide installations excluding China, reaching number 4 position
in the global wind ranking published by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

In addition to increasing sales, Gamesa also enhanced profitability in 2016. EBIT amounted to €477
million, 48% more than in 2015, and the EBIT margin was 10.4%, 1.1 percentage points more than in
2015. Net profit increased 1.8-fold to €301 million.

23 Atconstant 2015 average exchange rates,

146

%

In this context of strong growth of activity and revenues, Gamesa continues to prioritise a sound
balance sheet by controlling both working capital and capex. Gamesa reduced working capital by
€237 million year-on-year and improved the working capital/revenues ratio by over 5 percentage
points, to -4.9%. This reduction in working capital, together with greater operating cash flow and
capex planning tied to actual growth, enabled Gamesa to end 2016 with €423 million in net free cash
flow, 2.3 times the 2015 figure, and a net cash position of €682 million.

The company is also making significant progress with its long-term strategy, which includes the merger
with Siemens Wind Power, expected to be completed in the first quarter or beginning of the second
quarter of 2017. At the date of this report, the merger had been approved by Gamesa's shareholders
and cleared by Spain's National Securities Market Commission and it was only pending approval by the
European Union competition authorities. With this agreement, Gamesa enhances the visibility and
sustainability of its value creation proposal to all its stakeholders for the medium and long term.

Gamesa also maintains its commitment to profitable growth in 2017 with a plan to achieve double-digit
growth — around 15% — with respect to 2016” in both sales volume (MWe) and operating profit (EBIT),

Main business risks

Gamesa Group is exposed to certain financial risks that it manages by grouping together risk
identification, measurement, concentration limitation and oversight systems. Gamesa’s Corporate
Division and the business units coordinate the management and limitation of financial risks through
the policies approved at the highest executive level, in accordance with the established rules, policies
and procedures. The identification, assessment and hedging of financial risks are responsibility of each
business unit, together with the Corporate Division.

The risk associated with changes in exchange rates assumed for GAMESA’s transactions involve the
purchase and sale of products and services relating to its activity that are denominated in various
currencies.

In order to mitigate this risk, GAMESA has obtained financial hedging instruments from financial

institutions.

Use of financial instruments

Gamesa Group uses financial hedges which allow the Group to mitigate risks involving exchange
rates, interest rates, and equity volatility that could affect the Group estimated results based on
estimates of expected transactions in its various areas of activity.

number 208151) and of March 9, 2015 (Relevant Event number 219885) between AREVA, SA and
GAMESA CORPORACION TECNOLOGICA, SA, among other companies within their respective
groups, the eventual change in control of GAMESA CORPORACION TECNOLOGICA, SA in favor
of a competitor would authorize the parties to the AREVA group to terminate the agreement,
a situation that could lead to the sale of AREVA’s participation held by GAMESA in the Joint
Venture or, ultimately, to the dissolution and liquidation of that company Joint Venture.

such as a change in control. The financial compensation agreed for such termination consists,
in general, of the payment of compensation up to a maximum of two years’ salary, depending on
personal and professional circumstances and the time at which the agreement was concluded.

Alternative Performance Metrics

Gamesa's financial information contains magnitudes and measurements prepared in accordance
with the applicable accounting standards and others referred to as Alternative Performance Metrics
(APM). The APM are considered to be “adjusted” magnitudes with respect to those presented in
accordance with EU-IFRS and, consequently, the reader should view them as supplementary to, but
not replacements for, the latter.

The APM are important for users of the financial information since they are the metrics used by
Gamesa Management to assess financial performance, cash flows and the financial position for the
purposes of the Group's financial, operational and strategic decisions.

The APM contained in Gamesa's financial disclosures that cannot be directly reconciled with them
are as follows:

Return on capital employed - ROCE

This APM is used by Gamesa management to assess the ability of operational assets to generate
profits; it is a measure of the profitability and efficiency of invested capital (equity plus debt)

ROCE is calculated as:

Where t is the rate of corporate income tax and (CE) is the average capital employed in the period
Capital employed measures the capital invested in the group (equity plus debt) and is calculated as
Total Equity + Net Financial Debt [NFD, defined below]. Average capital employed is calculated as
the arithmetic mean of capital employed at the beginning of the current year and capital employed
at the end of the period. ROCE is calculated for 12-month periods: for interim periods that do not
coincide with a full accounting year, EBIT in the last twelve months is used.

The tax rate used is 28.3% in 2016 (28% in 2015), in accordance with the latest estimates of the
average tax rate in the year.

Net financial debt (NFD)

Net financial debt (NFD) is calculated as the sum of the company's bank borrowings, including
subsidised loans (repayable advances), derivative instruments and other current and non-current
financial liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and the value of short-term financial investments.

Net Financial Debt is the main APM used by Gamesa management to measure the Group's
indebtedness and leverage (when compared with Capital Employed).

Working capital (WC)

Working Capital (WC) is calculated as the difference between current assets and current liabilities.
Current assets and liabilities exclude all items classified as Net Financial Debt, such as Cash and
cash equivalents.

Working Capital reflects the part of Capital Employed that is invested in net operating assets.
Gamesa management uses this metric in managing and making decisions with respect to the
business's cash conversion cycle, particularly in managing inventory, trade accounts receivable and
trade accounts payable. Effective management of working capital involves achieving an optimal
amount of working capital without jeopardising the company’s ability to honour its obligations in
the short term.

the revenue in the twelve months prior to that date.

Capital Expenditure (Capex)

Capital Expenditure (capex) refers to investments made in the period in fixed assets (productive
assets, whether tangible or intangible) in order to generate future profits (and maintain the current
capacity to generate profits, in the case of maintenance capex).

The amount of Capex is obtained directly from the financial statements:

‘Acquisition of intangible assets 2 56
Acquisition of property, plant and equipment 139 1m
Capex 2m 168

Definitions of cash flow

Gross operating cash flow: amount of cash generated by the company’s ordinary operations,
excluding working capital and capital expenditure (capex). Gamesa includes the flow of net financial
expenses under gross operating cash flow. Gross operating cash flow is obtained by adding, to
reported income for the year, the ordinary non-cash items (depreciation and amortisation, and over-
provisions) and income from equity-accounted affiliates.

Net operating cash flow: the result of deducting working capital (defined in item 6) from gross
operating cash flow. Gamesa includes the cash impact of other provisions and other nan-operating
items under operating cash flow.

Free cash flow: obtained by deducting capital expenditure (capex) from operating cash flow. It
indicates the funds available for use to distribute dividends, buy back shares, pay dawn debt or
other corporate activities not related to ordinary business

Free cash flow is calculated as the variation in Net Financial Debt (NFO) between December 2016
and 2015 (defined in item 2 above) plus dividends paid in the period.

Contribution Margin, Structural Expenses and EBIT

The Contribution Margin (CM) is the difference between revenue and variable costs. Deducting fixed
(structural) costs, period depreciation and amortisation and impairments from the Contribution
Margin gives EBIT. The Contribution Margin is normally presented as a percentage of revenue, the
latter being revenue (total or by segments, as appropriate) in the financial statements.

Structural expenses are calculated by deducting period depreciation and amortisation, impairments
and the Contribution Margin from EBIT. Structural expenses are presented as a percentage of
revenues, the latter being revenue in the financial statements.

EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes): operating profit per the consolidated income statement.
Operating profit before income from equity-accounted affiliates, net financial results including
exchange gains/losses, taxes and income from discontinued operations/available-for-sale assets
and non-controlling interests

EBIT margin: ratio of reported EBIT to Revenue in the periad (i.e. revenue in the consolidated profit
and loss account)

Net profit and Net profit per share (EPS

Net profit: consolidated profit for the year attributable to the parent company.

Net profit per share (EPS): the result of dividing net profit by the average number of shares
outstanding in the period (excluding treasury shares).

Other indicators

Coverage of WTG sales volume: the sales coverage ratio expresses the likelihood of achieving the
WTC sales volume targets set by the company for a given year. It is calculated as orders received in
the period (in MW) for activity/sale in a given year, divided by the activity/sales guidance for that
year. Where the commitment is expressed as a range, the mid-point of the range is used. Where
the commitment is expressed as a minimum volume, the ratio is calculated using that minimum
volume.

MWe: an indicator of activity (a physical unit of sale) used to measure wind turbine generator
manufacture in terms of work in progress. The MWe indicator does not reflect post- manufacturing
processes (civil engineering, installation, commissioning, etc.), which also generate monetary
revenue.

Cost of energy (LCOE/COE): the cost of converting a source of energy, e.g. wind, into electricity,
measured in monetary units per MWh. It is calculated taking account of all costs incurred during
the asset's life cycle (including construction, finance, fuel, operation and maintenance, taxes and
incentives), divided by the total output expected from the asset during its useful life.

Auditor’s report on information
relating to the internal

control over financial reporting
(ICFR) for 2016


--- Page 21 ---

(Translation of a report originally issued in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy,
the Spanish-language version prevails)

Auditor's report on information relating to the internal control over financial reporting
(ICFR) of GAMESA CORPORACION TECNOLOGICA, S.A. for 2016

To the Directors,

At the request of the Board of GAMESA CORPORACION TECNOLOGICA, S.A. (hereinafter
the Company), and in accordance with our proposal dated December 2, 2016, we applied
certain procedures to the accompanying “ICFR-related information” included in the
Corporate Governance Report, hereinafter CGR, (English version pages 70 to 87) for GAMESA
CORPORACION TECNOLOGICA, S.A. and subsidiaries for 2016, which summarizes the
Company's internal control procedures regarding annual financial information

The Board of Directors is responsible for taking appropriate measures to reasonably ensure
the implementation, maintenance, supervision, and improvement of a correct internal control
system, as well as preparing and establishing the content of all the related accompanying
ICFR data

It is worth noting that apart from the quality of design and operability of the Company's
internal control system as a far as annual financial reporting is concerned, it only provides
a reasonable, rather than absolute, degree of security regarding its objectives due to the
inherent limitations to the internal control system as a whole.

Throughout the course of our audit work on the financial statements, and in conformity with
Technical Auditing Standards, the sole purpose of our evaluation of the Company's internal
control system was to establish the scope, nature, and timing of the audit procedures
performed on its financial statements. Therefore, our internal control assessment performed
for the audit of the aforementioned financial statements was not sufficiently extensive to
enable us to express a specific opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control over the
regulated annual financial information.

For the purpose of issuing this report, we exclusively applied the specific procedures described
below and indicated in the Guidelines on the Auditors’ report relating to information on the
Internal Control over Financial Reporting on Listed Companies, published by the Spanish
National Securities Market Commission on its website, which establishes the work to be
performed, the minimum scope thereof and the content of this report. Given that the scope
of the abovementioned procedures performed was limited and substantially less than that
of an audit carried out in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have
not expressed an opinion regarding its efficacy, design, or operational effectiveness regarding

169


--- Page 22 ---

the Company's 2015 financial data described in the accompanying ICFR information
Consequently, had we applied additional procedures to those established by the Guidelines
mentioned above or had we carried out an audit or a review of the internal control over the
regulated annual financial reporting information, other matters have been disclosed which
would have been reported to you.

Likewise, since this special engagement does not constitute an audit of the financial
statements or a review in accordance with Royal Decree 1/2011, dated July 1, enacting the
revised Audit Law, we do not express an audit opinion in the terms provided for therein

The following procedures were applied

1

Read and understand the information prepared by the Company in relation to the ICFR
-which is provided in the Annual Corporate Governance Report disclosure information
included in the Directors’ Report- and assess whether such information addresses all
the required information which will follow the minimum content detailed in section F,
relating to the description of the ICFR, as per the [AGC model established by CNMV
Circular n° 7/2015 dated December 2, 2015.

Make inquiries of personnel in charge of preparing the information described in point
1 above in order to: (i) obtain an understanding of its preparation process; (ii) obtain
information making it possible to evaluate whether the terminology employed is in line
with reference framework definitions (iii) gather information regarding whether the
described control procedures are implemented and functioning within the Company.

Review the explanatory documentation supporting the information described in
section 1 above, which should basically include everything directly provided to those
in charge of preparing the descriptive ICFR information. This documentation includes
reports prepared by the Internal Audit Department, senior management, and other
internal and external experts in their role supporting the the Audit Committee.

Compare the information contained in section 1 above with the Company's ICFR
knowledge obtained as a result of performing the procedures within the framework of
auditing the financial statements.

Read the minutes of the Board Meetings, Audit Committees, and other Company
committees in order to evaluate the consistency between issues related to the ICFR
and information discussed in section 1

Obtain the representation letter related to the work performed, duly signed by those
responsible for preparing and authorizing the information discussed in section 1.

170

As a result of the procedures applied on the ICFR-related information, no
inconsistencies or incidents have come to our attention which might affect it.

This report was prepared exclusively within the framework of the requirements
of the article 540 of the Corporate Enterprises Act, by Circular number 7/2015 of
the Spanish National Security Market, related to the description of the ICFR in
the Corporate Governance Report.
