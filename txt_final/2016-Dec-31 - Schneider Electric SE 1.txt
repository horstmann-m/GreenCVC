Trends in Schneider Electric’s core markets

1. Trends in Schneider Electric's

core markets

Industries and machine manufacturers

Market has rebounded during the last quarter of 2016 following a
stabilization in Q3 after eight straight quarters of decline.

This improvement has been mainly driven by continuing recovery in
China's capex and a rebound in raw material prices (Oil & metals).

Improvement in prices has led to:

@ increasing income in Oil & mining-producing countries
(supportive for all of our end-markets);

@ increasing spending in opex, maintenance and sometimes
brownfield capex in O&G upstream and Mining sector.

This backdrop has produced positive spillovers: sectors which
export to China and supply equipment to O&G and Mining have
revised upwards their own opex & capex plans.

China's recovery has supported the growth of trading partners (as
East Asia), and the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacture) global
market.

Non residential and residential buildings

Non residential buildings

Non residential market was mixed in 2016 with China being the
bright spot.

In the US, market slowed-down in 2016. Manufacturing buildings
declined as the chemical and transportation equipment sectors
contracted after several years of very strong growth. Conversely,
construction in commercial, retail and educational segments
accelerated.

In Western Europe, non residential construction improved slightly
from a low base. Manufacturing and office buildings continued
to recover in 2016, whereas commercial segment recorded a
positive growth, thereby ending the continuous decline since 2008.
Institutional building segments expanded marginally, hampered
by a decline in the healthcare segment. In 2016, non residential
construction turned positive in Germany and France.

In China, non residential construction grew strongly, mainly thanks to
public buildings. This segment was helped by greater government
pressure to support growth and improved funding conditions at
the local government level. Office and commercial buildings were
flat, hampered by over-supply and the rapid development of
e-commerce.

In India, the market continued to grow, helped by accommodative
government policies and positive business climate.

In Brazil, 2016 was another year of contraction.

In the Middle-East, the market declined. In Saudi Arabia, lower
revenues from the oil industry led to a drop in Government spending
and liquidity shortage, with Public companies delaying payments
to contractors.

Residential

Residential market growth accelerated in 2016, with varied positions
among major regional blocks.

In the US, growth decelerated due to slowing demand in the single-
family segment.

In Western Europe, growth gained momentum in 2016, driven by
low interest rates that led to higher demand. France turned positive
after three years of decline. Strong growth in Germany was driven
by high job growth and ever lower unemployment rates. Growth
accelerated slightly in Spain but slowed-down in the UK.

In China, residential construction recovered from beginning of 2016
after 2 consecutive years of decline. The recovery in property sector
has been triggered by an accommodative monetary environment.
Excess liquidity and easy credit led to a surge in residential sales. It
has materially reduced inventory levels across most regions, except
the North, which has pushed developers to increase housing starts.

EEE Utilities and Infrastructures

Electrical Utilities

In Western Europe, utilities’ capex growth was driven by renewable
equipment.

In the US, utilities’ capex growth slowed-down in Distribution as
well as in Transmission

In Emerging countries, volatility in economic conditions and
commodity and energy prices led to delay some investment
decisions. However, the situation has improved at year-end

The global utility market is continuously foreseen to grow over
the years, but considerable changes are already appearing as
a consequence of COP21 and COP22, in the “3D” context of
Decarbonization, Decentralization, and Digitization, with an ever
increasing adoption of Renewable Energy. The majority of power
generation investment has been redirected to renewable energy,
involving traditional utility investors as well as private investors
(IPP), and more recently Oil&Gas companies, and even down to
community or consumer level through a prosumer household, smart
district & building development. Energy Efficiency is also driving
substantial investment, and having a negative impact of the power
consumption growth trends.

In this context of energy transition, grid operator's mission is to
ensure that the appropriate network reliability, stability & power
quality is evolving towards new missions and the implementation

Data centers and Networks

The global IT market experienced nearly flat growth in 2016 due
to political uncertainty in global markets, as well as international
trade, energy and foreign exchange volatility, which has fostered
a wait-and-see approach causing some enterprises to delay IT
investments.

In 2016, anumber of major technology trends converged including
cloud computing, mobile edge analytics, digital business and
artificial intelligence. In response, Large Enterprises continued to
deploy IT in a hybrid environment of on-premise, colocation, hosting
and cloud.

In particular, aggressive build-out of cloud computing platforms
by internet giants was a key driver of significant growth at both
hyperscale sites and regional data centers. Schneider Electric is
leveraging its global presence and comprehensive data center
solutions to accommodate our customer needs wherever they
decide to locate their IT infrastructure.

As internet use is trending towards bandwidth-intensive content
such as augmented reality, video on demand, and social media, and
with the increasing adoption of the Internet of Things, computing
power and storage is increasingly placed at the edge of the network
closer to end users. The IT division is well positioned to drive faster
growth by targeting various edge computing applications such as
micro data center and modular data center offers, which provide
our customers with fast deployment, flexibility and higher efficiency.

of new technologies. Regulatory practices are being redefined to
allow more software-based smart grid investment as opposed to
conventional hardware investment.

Oil & Gas

The oil barrel price bottomed below 30 US dollars (Brent) in
January 2016, but had almost doubled by early 2017.

Hopes for an OPEC production curtailment agreement have
generated several increases over the year, each time challenged
by high levels of stocks, non-conventional oil production in the US,
increasing production & exports by Iraq and Iran, etc.

Recent OPEC decisions are now impacting the barrel price step
by step, but implementation details are still to be settled. Non-
conventional oil production is becoming more and more cost
effective with break-even costs almost half of the pre-crisis levels.
The ability to rapidly switch on and off production will keep the oil
price low — as soon as the price goes up, more production will be
added.

Improvement in oil price has led to a recovery in spending in opex,
maintenance and sometimes brownfield capex during the last
quarter of 2016. Capex in large projects has continued to decline
over the year.

The data center three phase power and cooling infrastructure
market continued to experience a shift from internal enterprise
data centers to colocation & cloud. In this environment, overall
growth was flat, with faster growth in megawatt applications, where
Schneider is well positioned as a technology leader.

Industrial power and infrastructure customers streamlined their
capital expenditure budgets, particularly in emerging markets, in
line with the collapse of oil and commodity prices earlier in the
year, which affected economies in Brazil, Russia, and the Middle
East. However, with the stabilization of commodity prices, along
with the continued moderate outlook for infrastructure investments
in power generation, chemical production and semiconductors in
North America and Europe, the outlook for 2017 is positive.

The worldwide IT services market showed strong growth, a trend
which is expected to continue in 2017. Buyer investments in legacy
IT equipment, and new digital software services, including intelligent
automation, predictive analytics, and services optimization and
innovation continue to reflect high demand. In this environment,
we launched new digital platforms such as StruxureOn™, enabling
protection of our customers’ most critical equipment through
smart alarming, remote troubleshooting and data-driven insights,
delivered by experts monitoring connected data center assets 24/7
— providing visibility and live data directly to your smartphone.

Review of the consolidated financial statements

2. Review of the consolidated financial

statements

Review of business and consolidated statement of income

Changes in the scope of consolidation

In 2016, the Group reconsidered the prevailing elements in the
analysis of control over Delixi performed in 2014 following the
transition to IFRS 10. Following this analysis, Delixi has been
consolidated by the equity method as of January 1*, 2016 without
restatement of comparative information in respect of the impacts
considered nonmaterial.

Acquisitions & divestments occurred
during the year

On March 31, 2016, the disposal of the Transportation business
(announced in 2015) was finalized with a final sale price established
at EUR31 million.

No significant acquisitions occurred during 2016.

Acquisitions & divestments occurred
in 2015

On December 11, 2015, Schneider Electric announced that it
had obtained all required regulatory approvals and subsequently
finalized the sale of Juno Lighting, LLC (“Juno”) to Acuity
Brands, Inc. for a consideration of approximately USD385 million
(EUR343 million). The transaction generated a capital loss of
EUR163 million recorded as Other operating expense.

No significant acquisition occurred during 2015.

Changes in foreign exchange rates

Changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the euro had a negative
impact over the year. This effect amounts to negative EUR679 million
on consolidated revenue and to negative EUR199 million Adjusted
EBITA”.

Revenue

On December 31, 2016, the consolidated revenue of Schneider
Electric totaled EUR24,693 million, a decrease of 7.3% at current
scope and exchange rates compared to EUR26,640 million on
December 31, 2015.

This variance breaks down into an organic decrease of -0.9%, an
effect linked to the disposals of -3.9% and a negative exchange
rate effect of -2.5%, primarily due to the appreciation of the British
pound and the Chinese yuan against the euro.

Solutions represent 44% of the total revenue in 2016, versus 43%
in 2015.

Changes in revenue by operating segment

The Building business generated revenues of EUR10,700 million,
or 43% of the consolidated total. This represents a decrease of
-9.8% on a reported basis, mainly due to the deconsolidation of
Delixi (-5.5 pts), and an increase of +0.3% on a like-for-like basis,
with growth in Wiring Devices & Final Distribution activities. North
America was up. The US benefitted from successful new offer
launches in a favorable construction market while the commercial
& industrial buildings market was tepid. Mexico posted continued
growth throughout the year. Western Europe was about flat, with
mixed results. Spain and Italy grew on successful commercial

initiatives while Germany declined. France was down despite
growth in improving residential markets. The Nordics grew thanks
to new product launches, while the UK was flat. Asia Pacific grew
slightly, driven by strong growth in India, while Australia suffered
from a high base of comparison. China posted slight growth thanks
to successful commercial initiatives and improvement in Tier 1 and
Tier 2 construction markets. Rest of the World declined, dragged
down by the economic situation in the Middle East, while CIS and
Africa posted growth. South America was about stable, as the
decline in Brazil was offset by growth in the rest of the region.

The Industry business generated revenues of EUR5,485 million,
or 22% of the consolidated total. This represents a decrease of
-3.7% on a reported basis and a decrease of -1.2% on a like-
for-like basis. Organic growth continued to be impacted by lower
Oil & Gas prices. Western Europe was flat, with growth in Italy
and Spain offsetting declines in France and the UK. North America
continued to be weighed down by lower industrial investments
and a strong US dollar, while the priority remains enhancing cross-
selling through channel initiatives. Asia Pacific declined, suffering
from weak industrial investment in China, despite good growth in
India and Korea. Rest of the World was up, with mixed results, with
Africa and CIS posting growth, offsetting declines in the Middle East
and South America. Services were up for the year.

The Infrastructure business generated revenues of
EUR4,919 million, or 20% of the consolidated total. This represents
a decrease of -9.4% on a reported basis and a decrease of -3.4%
ona like-for-like basis, driven by greater project selectivity. Excluding
the impact of selectivity initiatives, the business was slightly up
for the year. Western Europe grew, driven by growth in the UK,
France, and Germany. North America was down, as lower O&G

Gross profit

Gross profit decreased from EUR9,845 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015 to EUR9,390 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, or -4.6%, mainly due to the perimeter impacts.

prices and a stronger dollar weighed on industrial investments
in the US, and Canada continued to suffer from less resource-
linked investment. Asia-Pacific declined. In China, growth from
emerging market segments could not offset the weakness seen in
traditional segments, while Australia suffered from lower investment
in resources. Rest of the World was down due to weakness in
the Middle-East, where persistently low O&G prices led to lower
investment. Services continued to grow.

The IT business generated revenues of EUR3,589 million, or 15%
of the consolidated total. This represents a decrease of -1.9% in
a reported basis and a decrease of -0.8% on a like-for-like basis.
Overall, the environment was mixed, with growing investment in
some data center segments such as co-location, but lower IT
spending in some regions. The US grew, driven by reinvigorated
IT channels and strong services growth. Western Europe declined,
due to Germany and the UK, in soft IT markets. Asia Pacific grew,
driven by strong growth in India and East Asia, while Japan
declined. Rest of the World was penalized by weakness in the
Middle East and Africa. Services posted solid growth

As a percentage of revenues, the gross margin increased to 38.0%
in 2016 (versus 37.0% in 2015), thanks to productivity improvements
and the selectivity of the projects.

Support Function Costs: research and development and selling,
general and administrative expenses

Research and development expenses, excluding capitalized
development costs and development costs reported as cost
of sales, decreased by 5.3% from EURS65 million for the year
ended December 31, 2015 to EUR535 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenues, the net cost of
research and development remained stable at 2.2% of revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2016 (2.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2015).

Total research and development expenses, including capitalized
development costs and development costs reported as cost of sales
(see note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) decreased by
2.8% from EUR1,272 million for the year ended December 31, 2015
to EUR1,236 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a
percentage of revenues, total research and development expenses
increased slightly at 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016
from 4.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015.

In 2016, the net effect of capitalized development costs and
amortization of capitalized development costs amounted to
EUR107 million on operating income versus EUR145 million in 2015.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 4.4%
from EUR5,639 million for the year ended December 31, 2015
to EUR5,375 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As
a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative
expenses increased from 21.2% in 2015 to 21.8% in 2016.

Combined total support function costs, that is, research and
development expenses together with selling, general and
administrative costs, totaled EUR5,910 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 compared to EUR6,204 million for the year
ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of 4.7%. The support
function costs to sales ratio increased from 23.3% for the year ended

Net profit amounted to EUR264 million in 2016 compared with EUR238 million of net profit in 2015.

5. Outlook

In 2017 the Group expects more positive momentum in its major
end-markets. In North America, modest growth is anticipated with
improvement in industrial activity and continued growth in residential
markets. Western Europe is expected to grow moderately, benefiting
from an environment with a lower Euro and still relatively low oil price,
while some Brexit-related risks remain. China is expected to improve
in Industry and Infrastructure markets while the construction market
should grow at a slower pace due to policy tightening. The Group
will still face headwinds from O&G and continued weakness in some
resource driven economies, although these may ease towards the
end of the year

Additionally, in 2017 the Group will face a strong increase in raw
material costs estimated at c.EUR(200) million at current prices. In
this environment, the Group's priority is to grow its partner network
