Directors’ Report 2022

2022 was a good year and KONGSBERG had a strong order backlog of more than MNOK 63,000

and improved market positions at the year-end. Globally, the year was characterised by changes

in the security situation, an unstable energy market, inflation and the consequences of climate

changes. The security situation in Europe has strengthened the focus on nations’ defence

capabilities and the security needs that must be met. At the same time, we must think ahead
and transition to more environmentally friendly energy sources, which make an important

contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These challenges require cross-border
efforts from both politicians and industry. At KONGSBERG, we will actively strive to contribute

to good solutions.

Operating revenues increased by 16 per cent
compared to 2021, to MNOK 31,803. Kongsberg
Maritime had operating revenues of MNOK 18,978,
Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace had operating
revenues of MNOK 11,860 and Kongsberg Digital
had operating revenues of MNOK 989. The Group's
order backlog increased from MNOK 49,535 at the
end of 2021 to MNOK 63,256 at the end of 2022.
Kongsberg Maritime’s order backlog increased by
MNOK 5,618, Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace’s
order backlog increased by MNOK 7,908 and
Kongsberg Digital's order backlog increased by
MNOK 218 during the year. In total, the Group's
order intake came to MNOK 45,150, up from MNOK
40,979 in 2021. The book-to-bill ratio was 1.42.

EBITDA increased by MNOK 516 to MNOK 4,602 in
2022. The EBITDA of both Kongsberg Maritime and
Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace increased, while
Kongsberg Digital’s EBITDA fell as a result of the
ongoing upscaling of the business. Strong project
implementation and cost discipline contributed to
the good profitability.

The profit for the year after tax was MNOK 2,809 in
2022, compared with MNOK 2,290 the previous
year, equivalent to NOK 15.64 per share (NOK
12.06). The Group had a change in cash and cash
equivalents of MNOK -4,186 in 2022 (MNOK 697)
and net interest-bearing debt of MNOK -1,479
(MNOK -5,668) at the year-end. The Group had

equity of MNOK 13,744 (MNOK 13,618) at the end of
2022.

KONGSBERG has a solid financial position, and on
this basis the Board of Directors will propose a
dividend of NOK 12.00 per share to the Annual
General Meeting on 11 May 2023 (a total of MNOK
2,128), of which NOK 3.60 is in accordance with the
Group's ordinary dividend policy and NOK 8.40 is
in addition.

The total emissions from own activities (scopes 1
and 2) were reduced by 3.0 per cent compared to
2021. This corresponded to a reduction of 16.3 per

cent when measured relative to operating revenues.

The business areas

KONGSBERG is a listed company with its head
office in Kongsberg in Norway. In 2022, the Group
had three business areas: Kongsberg Defence &
Aerospace, Kongsberg Maritime and Kongsberg
Digital. The Group is administered via its parent
company, Kongsberg Gruppen ASA.

Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace had operating
revenues of MNOK 11,860 in 2022, MNOK 1,782
more than in 2021. The EBITDA margin was 21.2 per
cent, compared to 21.3 per cent in 2021. The order
backlog increased from MNOK 35,632 at the end of
2021 to MNOK 43,540 at the end of 2022, of which
80 per cent comprised deliveries outside Norway.
‘The strong order backlog provides a good starting
point for continued growth in operating revenues
going forward.

its operating revenues by more than 50 per cent in
2022. This division’s deliveries include the NASAMS
air defence system, combat systems for submarines
and digital solutions for military vehicles. The
order backlog, which amounts to more than MNOK
11,000 at the end of the year, mainly consists of
combat systems for new Norwegian and German
submarines as well as air defence projects.

Through its Aerostructures & MRO division,
KONGSBERG has supplied advanced composite
and titanium aircraft parts for the F-35 fighter
aircraft since 2008. Delivery volumes have risen
each year. From producing a few ship set of parts in
the early years, the programme is now in full
production. In addition, the division has a signifi-
cant maintenance business through Kongsberg
Aviation Maintenance Services, which includes,
among other things, an agreement for preparation
of Norwegian F-16 aircraft for disposal. The division
continued to grow in 2022 and has an order backlog
of just over MNOK 4,500.

The Land Systems division supplies remote weapon
stations (RWS) and communications equipment.
Shortages of components related to the delivery of
RWS had a negative effect on the division through-
out the year. In 2022, a new five-year framework
agreement worth MUSD 1,500 was signed with the
US Army. The agreement covers further deliveries,
maintenance and development work relating to the
Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station
(CROWS) programme. KONGSBERG has been a
supplier to the CROWS programme since 2007 and

has delivered more than 14,000 CROWS systems
and over 21,000 RWS in total to customers in 28
countries. At the end of 2022, the division had an
order backlog of close to MNOK 6,000.

The Missile Systems division had 30 per cent
growth in operating revenues and an order intake
of more than MNOK 11,000 in 2022. The Naval
Strike Missile (NSM) and Joint Strike Missile (JSM)
are the division’s main products. These long-range
high-precision missiles are world leaders with their
5th generation low-signature design. Missile
Systems signed several contracts for the delivery
of NSMs throughout the year, including a signifi-
cant contract with Australia worth more than
MNOK 5,000. NSMs and JSMs have now been sold
to or chosen by a total of twelve nations. The
division will deliver an order backlog worth more
than MNOK 21,000 over the next years.

Through its Space & Surveillance division and the
Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) 50 per cent
owned, KONGSBERG is the Nordic region’s largest
supplier of equipment and services to the aerospace
industry. Space is an important focus area for
Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace and in 2022 we
acquired a majority ownership stake in NanoAvion-
ics, a Lithuanian small-satellite company, in which
we own 78.5 per cent of the shares. This is a leading
player in the development and production of small
satellites and has contributed to over 120 satellite
projects. In 2022, the division had operating
revenues of just under MNOK 1,000 and an order
backlog of just over MNOK 1,600. KSAT’s operating

revenues of close to MNOK 1,500 and order backlog
of more than MNOK 4,000 are not included in the
division’s figures as these are incorporated into the
financial statements under share from an associates.

Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace owns 49.9 per cent
of Finnish Group Patria, an international provider
of defence, security and aerospace systems and
services. Patria has in 2022 a turnover of MEUR 627
and has a profit after tax of MEUR 46.

‘The Russian war in Ukraine has led to a new securi-
ty situation in Europe that stresses the importance
of nations’ defence capabilities and highlights secu-
rity needs that must be met. Kongsberg Defence &
‘Aerospace received an increasing number of
requests for quotations and experienced a focus on
the product portfolio related to this during the year.
‘The ongoing Russian warfare has also made supply
chains more unpredictable, for example related to
the transport and supply of goods.

A shortage of individual components affected
many companies in 2022. Kongsberg Defence &
Aerospace is dependent on deliveries from several
hundred subcontractors both in Norway and
abroad. The component situation particularly
affected deliveries from Land Systems during the
year. The situation improved slightly towards the
year-end, but developments are being closely moni-
tored and still affect progress and deliveries
somewhat.

The sales process in defence programmes is
extensive and time-consuming. The buyers of
large defence systems are national authorities in
different countries. These customers look on
national security and domestic business develop-
mentas significant factors, in addition to price and
performance, when purchasing defence-related
products. National budgets and political guidelines
will therefore have a strong impact on whether

and when any contracts can be entered into with
KONGSBERG. The market is not subject to
international free-trade agreements and is more
characterised by national protectionism than most
other industries. Predictability in the export
regulations governing defence-related products
and in the application of these regulations is
therefore an important framework condition for
KONGSBERG.

For the Norwegian defence industry, it is important
that Norway’s authorities place emphasis on
repurchase agreements, joint development agree-
ments and agreements that ensure market access
in connection with purchases of defence-related
products from other countries. When the Norwe-
gian Armed Forces make large investments through
foreign suppliers, these often constitute a signifi-
cant part of the defence budget. In order to ensure
defence deliveries that are well suited to Norwegian
conditions and guarantee a viable and competitive
Norwegian defence industry, it is very important to
have Norwegian participation in such programmes.
Both the Norwegian government and parliament
have stressed the importance of Norwegian compa-

nies’ industrial participation, and that this is in line
with international practice.

KONGSBERG will continue to place emphasis on
partnerships with major defence contractors and
make efforts to further increase the focus on
supporting local industry in the business area’s
markets, Our position as an attractive defence
contractor in the international market will continue
to be based on close cooperation with the Norwe-
gian Armed Forces. This cooperation forms the
platform for the development of leading products
that are necessary for modern armed forces. Such
participation also means increased activity for
many of the business area’s approximately 1,500
Norwegian subcontractors.

Kongsberg Maritime had operating revenues of
MNOK 18,978 in 2022, up from MNOK 16,507 in
2021. EBITDA came to MNOK 2,390 and the
EBITDA margin was 12.6 per cent in 2022, com-
pared to MNOK 1,977 (12.0 per cent) in 2021. The
order intake in 2022 was MNOK 24,353, correspond-

ing to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.28. The order intake
increased by MNOK 6,417 compared to 2021.
Kongsberg Maritime has diversified exposure and
supplies equipment and solutions to most maritime
vessel segments, such as traditional transport
vessels, offshore, fishing, research and passenger
ships, as well as marine robotics. This makes the
business area less vulnerable to fluctuations in
individual segments.

At the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020,
a number of measures were quickly implemented
to limit infection, maintain as normal operations as
possible and ensure that the cost level was adapted
to the activity level. Throughout the pandemic,
there have at times been significant restrictions,
different in the various geographical areas, to.
comply with. These eased up in 2022 and most had
been lifted by the year-end. Kongsberg Maritime’s
results during the pandemic would have been
impossible without the measures that were imple-
mented during this period.

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and through-
out the ongoing war, considerable sanctions have
been imposed on Russia. In connection with this,
Kongsberg Maritime reviewed its customer relation-
ships that are affected by the current sanctions. This
led to provisions for bad debts of MNOK 21 in 2022.

‘The number of new vessels ordered worldwide fell
from 2021 to 2022. The reduction was mainly in the
container-ship market, where the number of new
orders was very high in 2021. The LNG, offshore

wind and naval sectors represent markets in which
Kongsberg Maritime has built up strong positions.
‘These markets were strong in 2022, which also
meant that, despite a reduction in the number of
new vessels ordered in the market, Kongsberg
Maritime increased the order intake by 36 per cent.

Through its Sensors & Robotics division, Kongsberg
Maritime has a portfolio of sensors and sensor solu-
tions that are central to mapping, monitoring and
understanding oceans. These contribute to the safe
and reliable control of operations both at and below
the sea surface. The division's order intake is to a
lesser extent driven by orders for new vessels. The
division had an order intake of more than MNOK
4,100 in 2022, up MNOK 1,100 from the previous
year. There was a strong influx of orders related to
the autonomous underwater vehicle Hugin, and a
significant contract was signed for the delivery of
the new Hugin Endurance variant. There is good
demand for solutions for monitoring the oceans.

As of 1 January 2023, Sensors & Robotics will
operate as a separate business area in KONGSBERG.

In the aftermarket, Kongsberg Maritime has a
well-established network servicing over 33,000
vessels fitted with Kongsberg Maritime equipment.
Kongsberg Maritime’s considerable operations are
the result of several decades of installing products
and systems. A new sale today generates after-
market activity over the next 20-30 years and good
aftermarket work during this period may in turn
lead to new sales at a later date. The interaction
between the newbuild market and aftermarket

activities is therefore extremely important, An
important driver of the increased aftermarket
activity in 2022 was the maritime markets’ greater
demand for more environmentally friendly solu-
tions. Among other things, this led to a significant
number of contracts for the upgrading and hybridi-
sation of existing vessels. In 2022, the aftermarket
accounted for about half of Kongsberg Maritime’s
revenues and order intake.

New regulations and a much greater focus on
sustainability in the market in general mean that
the demand for environmentally friendly and
climate-friendly solutions is growing. Kongsberg
Maritime has relatively low emissions from its own
operations, but it delivers to industries that have
historically been responsible for some considerable
emissions and are facing a major shift. One of the
most important objectives of Kongsberg Maritime’s
deliveries is to streamline and secure customers’
operations. In addition to having ambitions to
reduce the climate footprint of our own operations,
it is therefore important for us to work together
with customers to develop new, more sustainable
products and solutions. This is an aera where
Kongsberg Maritime and its technologies can really
make a difference.

The Norwegian maritime and offshore sector is
important for the export industry. The Board
therefore emphasises the need for an industrial
policy that promotes growth and development in
this sector, including competitive framework
conditions and financing solutions.

Kongsberg Digital

MNOK 2022 2021
Operating revenues 989 845
Recurring revenues 468 347
EBITDA (259) (45)
Order intake 1275 789
Order backlog 1150 932

Kongsberg Digital had operating revenues of
MNOK 989 in 2022, up from MNOK 845 in 2021.
Recurring revenues were 47 per cent of the operat-
ing revenues. EBITDA for the year was negative at
MNOK 259. Kongsberg Digital has high growth
ambitions. Throughout 2022, this business area
further strengthened its organisation with both
software developers and commercial resources, and
significant investments were made in the roll-out
of new solutions and applications. This affected
Kongsberg Digital’s EBITDA in 2022 and is expected
to continue affecting it in 2023, but with positive
developments during the year.

Demand for the ‘ship-to-cloud’ solution, Vessel
Insight, increased in 2022. During the year,
contracts were signed with several major players,
including one of the world’s largest container
shipping companies, Mediterranean Shipping
Company, which will install Vessel Insight on
nearly 500 vessels. At the year-end, Kongsberg
Digital had signed Vessel Insight agreements for
about 2,000 vessels. More than 80 shipowners now
use Vessel Insight for all or some of their vessel

fleet. In total, these shipowners control more than
3,000 vessels, representing a significant potential
for additional sales.

Since its formation, the business area has taken a
leading market position for dynamic digital twins
in the energy sector due to its Kognitwin product.
Since the first contract was signed with Shell in the
autumn of 2019, the number of both installations
and users has increased significantly. At year-end,
Kongsberg Digital had 18 digital twins in operation,
divided among four customers with more than
8,000 users. Kongsberg Digital also has several
ongoing proofs of concept (POC), where customers
test and evaluate Kognitwin on certain installa-
tions. The business area experienced good revenue
growth in 2022 and this is expected to continue in
2023.

‘The Digital Wells division accounted for 22 per cent
of this business area’s revenues in 2022 and has in
recent years contributed solid growth and positive
profit performance. This division has won several
important contracts, both traditional licence sales
and, increasingly, for ‘software as a service’ (SaaS).
At the same time, the further development of its
product portfolio has increased its revenue base.
Together with positive oil-production market
developments, continued good growth is expected
in the year ahead.

The Maritime Simulation unit accounted for 30 per
cent of Kongsberg Digital’s operating revenues in
2022, and experienced a slight decrease in operat-

ing revenues compared to 2021. However, the
unit’s order intake was 31 per cent higher than in
the previous year. Maritime Simulation operated
ina challenging market during the pandemic,
including in 2022, especially in Asia since educa-
tional institutions were completely or partially
closed there. The improved order intake and a
more positive market provide a basis for growth in
2023.

Kongsberg Digital operates using its own systems
and is followed up by a board consisting of board
members from KONGSBERG’s corporate executive
management as well as external and employee-
elected members. Kongsberg Digital’s current
phase makes it natural to consider various strategic
models for fully realising the value-creation
potential we can see for Kongsberg Digital, includ-
ing a stock-exchange listing.

ordinary dividend policy. In addition, an
MNOK 500 programme to buy back own shares for
cancellation was initiated. At 31 December 2022,
653,331 of these shares had been repurchased for a
total of MNOK 233. At the year-end, the number of
outstanding shares, including shares owned by
KONGSBERG, was 177,313,072.

Cash flow

KONGSBERG had a positive cash flow from operat-
ing activities of MNOK 1,106 (MNOK 4,970) in 2022.
This mainly consisted of EBITDA of MNOK 4,602,
adjusted for changes in current assets and other
operating items of MNOK -3,495. These were related
to an increase in inventories, delayed deliveries of
weapon stations and generally lower volumes paid
in on the major defence projects asa result of
natural cash-flow fluctuations in projects with large
milestone payments.

In 2022, there was a negative cash flow related to
investing activities of MNOK -1,343 (MNOK -769).
‘The largest outgoing cash flows related to investing
activities were MNOK 678 for the purchase/sale of
property, plant and equipment, MNOK 601 for
investments in subsidiaries, mainly NanoAvionics,
and MNOK 400 linked to capitalised development
and other intangible assets.

‘The net change in cash and cash equivalents,
after the effect of changes in exchange rates, was
MNOK -4,186 (MNOK 697).

Capital structure

‘The most important capital-allocation priority in
KONGSBERG’s financial policy is to have a solid
balance sheet by the net debt divided by EBITDA
being 1.5 as a long-term average, while at the same
time the net debt may not exceed 2.5 times the
EBITDA. This ensures a balance between creditors
and shareholders and also provides security for our
suppliers and customers. This is important, as
KONGSBERG is involved in deliveries that extend
over many years.

The capital-allocation priorities also take the
company’s dividend policy into account and are
further explained in Note 4 to the consolidated
financial statements in the annual report.

At 31 December 2022, the Group’s equity was
MNOK 13,744, equal to 31.8 per cent of the total
assets. The net interest-bearing debt (interest-
bearing debt less cash and cash equivalents) was
MNOK -1,479. At the year-end, the long-term
interest-bearing debt mainly consisted of three
long-term bond loans totalling MNOK 2,000.

The Group’s syndicated loan facility of MNOK 2,500
was unused at the end of 2022.

KONGSBERG has historically experienced substan-
tial fluctuations in working capital due to different
payment structures for major projects in Kongsberg
Defence & Aerospace. This situation is expected to
continue.

Foreign currency

The Group’s financial policy states that contracts
over acertain size must be currency hedged when
they are entered into, and these are mainly hedged
using forward exchange contracts (fair value
hedges). In special cases, the Group uses forward
exchange contracts or options as cash-flow hedges,
for example in the event of large tenders where the
probability of winning the contract is considered to
be high. The Group uses hedge accounting for
established forward exchange contracts, which
means that changes in the value of hedging instru-
ments and objects are capitalised.

At the end of 2022, net sales of foreign exchange as
fair value hedges amounted to MNOK 19,185 meas-
ured at agreed exchange rates, These forward
exchange contracts had a net fair value of MNOK
184, In addition, the Group had net sales of curren-
cy equivalent to MNOK 2,974 as cash-flow hedges
measured at agreed exchange rates, consisting of
forward exchange contracts. At the year-end, the
cash-flow hedges had a total net negative fair value
of MNOK 92.

Outlook for 2023

In recent years, KONGSBERG has developed
positively and demonstrated a good ability to adapt
to considerable and rapid changes. Despite compo-
nent shortages, demanding logistics and surging
inflation, the company has delivered both growth
and significantly improved results.

At the end of 2022, the Group had an order backlog
of MNOK 63,256, of which MNOK 25,100 is

for delivery in 2023. This equals about MNOK 5,000
more than the corresponding order coverage one
year earlier and provides a good basis for further
growth. The order intake from the aftermarket is
included in the order backlog to a minor extent.
Framework agreements come in addition to there-
ported order backlog. Order backlogs in associates
are not included in KONGSBERG’ order backlog.

As from the first quarter of 2023, Sensors & Robotics
and Kongsberg Maritime will operate as two
separate business areas. Kongsberg Maritime is
exposed to newbuilds and aftermarket relating to.
traditional merchant fleets and advanced marine
operations. Compared to 2022, fewer new vessels
are expected to be ordered in 2023, while a

good order intake is expected in the markets that
have traditionally represented higher value for
Kongsberg Maritime. Many shipyards have almost
full order books for the next few years, which
means that this business area’s order backlog
extends over a long period. The increasing need for

upgrades to reduce emissions from vessel opera-
tions means that continued high activity in the
aftermarket is expected in 2023. Overall, Kongsberg
Maritime is also expected to grow in 2023. Sensors
& Robotics is exposed to offshore, fisheries, re-
search, monitoring and marine operations. There is
a high demand for technology in all these seg-
ments, providing a basis for growth in 2023.

Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace has grown contin-
uously in recent years, increasing its order backlog
from MNOK 35,632 to MNOK 43,540 in 2022. Of the
order intake of MNOK 19,560 in 2022, MNOK 11,000
concerned orders for missiles, an area where high
growth is expected in the future and where invest-
ments are currently being made in expanded
production capacity. The turbulent world view and
situation for some components regarding availabili-
ty and logistics are factors that can affect both
demand and lead times. This makes it more
challenging than before to predict both the growth
rate and profitability levels. Profitability varies
between different product groups and different
geographies. The composition of the projects to
which deliveries are made is therefore an important
driver of profitability in this business area. The
business area’s long-term margin target is 17 per
cent in 2025, but this will vary between quarters.
Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace’s market activity is
ata record-high level and the basis for growth in
the short and medium term is very good.

Kongsberg Digital increased the number of in-
stalled Kognitwin and Vessel Insight systems in
2022, and there is high market activity and in-
creased demand for this business area’s solutions.
Asa result of continued significant investments in
increased capacity and the development and
roll-out of digital solutions in 2023, this business
area’s EBITDA and cash flow are expected to be
negative for the year as a whole. KONGSBERG’s
ambition is for Kongsberg Digital’s EBITDA to be
positive in 2024.

Future strategy and priorities
in 2023

KONGSBERG is a leading global technology group
that delivers products, systems and services to
critical and complex operations across a number of
sectors. We hold leading positions in our core
markets and will continue to grow in these. At the
same time, KONGSBERG is looking to new, adjacent
markets where the Group can effectively leverage
technologies and use its domain knowledge and
expertise to create solid positions. Growth will
mainly be driven organically, but we will also
consider acquisition opportunities when strategi-
cally relevant.

Across the Group, we manage our portfolio of
companies with the aim of ensuring the optimal

development of our operations to generate value
not only for our shareholders but also for our
employees, customers, partners and other
stakeholders.

Sustainability and safety are of great strategic
importance to KONGSBERG. We recognise that

the industries in which we operate are in a period
involving several adjustments. The transitions to
cleaner energy solutions, more digital and virtual
solutions and safer and more secure operations are
important drivers. The pace of change varies, but
KONGSBERG is well positioned and focused on
developing and delivering the best, smartest, safest
and most sustainable products and solutions to
meet our customers’ ever-changing needs and
contribute to a more sustainable world.

In 2022, we established Kongsberg Renewables
Technologies to strengthen the Group's offering to,
and presence in, the offshore renewable energy
market. We also announced that the Sensors &
Robotics division in Kongsberg Maritime will
operate as a separate business area from

1 January 2023. In 2023, our ambition is to build
Kongsberg Renewables Technologies and further
develop each of our now four established business
areas.

We recognise that their knowledge, dedication and
willingness to contribute make our employees one
of our most important competitive advantages.

A cornerstone of our strategy is our ambition to be
one of the greatest places to work. This means we

important focus area for Kongsberg Defence &
Aerospace. In 2022, we achieved so-called Initial
Depot Capability (IDC) for the F-35 programme at
Rygge as the second location outside the USA.
KONGSBERG’s position as a leading defence con-
tractor in Northern Europe was further confirmed
when the Royal Netherlands Navy selected NSM for
its frigate fleet in December. We also started to
build a new missile factory which will open in the
summer of 2024 and help to considerably expand
our production capacity.

Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace continuously
strives to identify opportunities to develop more
sustainable defence solutions. The circular econo-
my is an important focus area and activities that
extend the lifetime of systems are also high on the
agenda. We work closely with the entire value
chain, both customers and suppliers, in order to
contribute to the green shift, while at the same time
fulfilling our public-service role relating to security
and defence.

Kongsberg Maritime

‘Through Kongsberg Maritime, we have a leading
position as an equipment and system supplier to
the maritime market. Efficient operations, safety
and energy efficiency are important drivers for the
further development of Kongsberg Maritime’s
product portfolio. We aim to drive the green shift
and integrate operational efficiency and sustaina-
bility into all our products and services. We intend

to strengthen our position in the upgrade market,
especially in the delivery of hybrid solutions and
other energy-saving measures. We work closely
with our customers and partners to improve the
green footprint throughout a system's lifetime.
Kongsberg Maritime is part of the solution for
creating future sustainable oceans and aims to be
technology- and competence-leading with regard to
both transport and resource utilisation.

In 2022, we continued to work on efficiency meas-
ures and further increased our profitability com-
pared to the previous year. This business area also
continued to position itself for new sustainable
areas and, for example, had an order intake of more
than MNOK 1,700 for systems and concepts for
offshore wind vessels. In addition, the aftermarket
activities had a strong focus on upgrading to more
environmentally friendly solutions, including
hybridisation of vessels.

Kongsberg Digital

Kongsberg Digital continued to develop positively
in 2022 and strengthened its leading positions in
existing industries. This business area is well
positioned to become a key player in digitalisation
across capital-intensive industries. Our ambition is
to create a globally leading digital work surface. The
business area has continued to invest and strength-
en its capabilities within its core business areas,
and this has yielded results in the form of a sharp
rise in the number of vessels connected to the ship-

to-cloud solution Vessel Insight and the number of
installations and users of the dynamic digital-twin
solution Kognitwin. The current phase makes it
natural to consider future partner models and other
models in order to fully realise the value-creation
potential KONGSBERG envisages for Kongsberg
Digital, including a stock-exchange listing.

The KONGSBERG share and
shareholder relationships

KONGSBERG must provide the stock market with
relevant, comprehensive information as the basis
for a balanced, correct valuation of the share. We
place emphasis on having an open dialogue with
the stock market and media.

‘The price of the KONGSBERG share increased from
NOK 286.00 at the end of 2021 to NOK 415.60 at the
end of 2022. This gives a market capitalisation of
MNOK 73,671 at the end of 2022. Including dividend
totalling NOK 15.30 per share, the return in 2022
was 50.7 per cent. The Oslo Stock Exchange Bench-
mark Index (OSEBX) fell by 1 per cent during the
same period. At 31 December 2022, KONGSBERG
had 22,298 shareholders (16,507). The company had
1,008 (943) foreign shareholders that together
owned 22.76 per cent of the shares (19.90 per cent).

of Trade, Industry and Fisheries, is the largest

The 10 largest shareholders held a total of 66.38 per
cent (70.62) of the shares at the year-end. The
number of shares issued is 177.31 million, each with
anominal value of NOK 1.25. At the end of 2022,
KONGSBERG owned a total of 693,610 (613,987)

Apart from in 2000 and 2001, KONGSBERG has
paid dividends to its shareholders every year since
it was listed in 1993. The company’s dividend policy
states: ‘KONGSBERG’s aim is to pay an ordinary
dividend per share that is stable or growing from
one year to the next. Additional dividends and/or
repurchases of own shares can be used to supple-
ment ordinary dividends. All payments to share-
holders will be subject to the company’s assessment

interest in the share through activities aimed at
the investor market. KONGSBERG is regularly
represented at roadshows, meetings and conferenc-
es both in Norway and abroad. The goal for 2023
remains a high degree of availability and activity in
the investor market. Investor presentations are held
when each quarterly report is issued.

The Board regards employee share ownership as
positive. Every year, employee share programmes
are arranged so that Group employees can purchase
shares in the company. In the spring of 2022, the
Group’s annual employee share programme was
implemented for the 26th time. Shares were sold to
employees at a 25 per cent discount on the market
price. In 2022, all employees were offered shares for
up to NOK 100,000 before the 25 per cent discount
(taxable discount). A total of 858,110 shares were
sold to 4,363 employees who took advantage of

the offer.

Risk factors and risk
management

KONGSBERG is exposed to various forms of risk that
the Board monitors through dealing with individual
cases and risk reports made to the Board. The Board
believes there is a healthy balance between the
Group’s overall risk and risk-bearing capacity. The
administration prepares monthly operations reports

and quarterly risk reports that are discussed by the
Board. The administration performs risk analyses
in connection with major investments and custom-
er contracts, strategic initiatives and when enter-
prises are bought or sold. The Audit and Sustaina-
bility Committee is a preparatory body for the
Board with regard to the exercise of the Board’s
responsibility for dealing with financial reports,
relevant assessment items and compliance matters,
assessing the Group’s internal controls and risk
management, and sustainability and climate.

The Group’s operations are international, with
deliveries of high-tech systems and solutions
mainly to customers in the maritime and defence
markets, The market risk may therefore vary some-
what within these different segments. Its strong
international presence and global dependency
make the Group vulnerable to factors affecting
international trade, foreign exchange and the world
economy in general.

COVID-19 has negatively impacted the world since
the first outbreak at the start of 2020. The pandemic
has led to great uncertainty for the entire value
chain - due to travel restrictions, quarantine
regulations and other infection-control considera-
tions - and with regard to the flow of input factors
and finished products. Large parts of the world
returned to normal conditions without significant
restrictions in 2022, and no significant setbacks can
be seen on the horizon. China and some other
countries still face significant pandemic-related
challenges and will also be affected in 2023.

KONGSBERG was not significantly impacted by
the pandemic in 2022. The Group will continue to
monitor developments to protect its own employ-
ees and business associates and, in so far as
possible, ensure normal business operations. After
almost three years of COVID-19, we have gained a
lot of experience that will be valuable in dealing
with COVID-19 and any other pandemics and crisis
situations in the future.

2022 was marked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,
which started on 24 February 2022. The conflict
affects the flow of energy and goods between the
two countries and the rest of the world, and broad
sanctions were implemented in 2022. This affected
KONGSBERG during the year and will continue to
affect us in 2023, so the situation is being moni-
tored closely.

In 2021 and 2022 there has been a challenging
energy situation in Europe. This is as aconsequence
of the economic upturn following the COVID-19
pandemic, in which demand increased more than
supply, and was further exacerbated by Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine and the reduction in gas
imports from Russia. As a result of the drop in the
supply of goods and services during the pandemic,
the world economy was in 2022 characterised by
inflation and the countercyclical policies imposed
by countries’ central banks. KONGSBERG is
vulnerable to increases in the price of energy, wages
and materials, and implemented measures to
ensure the profitability of its delivery contracts in
2022.

KONGSBERG supplies products and services to
the complete value chain within oil & gas as well as
wind. Energy demand and price developments
affect the willingness to invest in these markets.
Investment levels may also vary between different
geographical areas, depending on factors such as
reserves and the level of exploration and produc-
tion activities. The uncertainty surrounding future
oil-price developments as well as the transforma-
tion towards renewable energy sources affect
investment levels in several segments, but also
provides opportunities in other segments where
KONGSBERG’s technology makes a difference. The
focus on sustainability and climate is constantly
increasing and this affects the offshore market. It
affects investors’ and lenders’ assessments, and
may also affect us and our customers’ and suppli-
ers’ activities and priorities going forward. Offshore
wind is a market that is growing rapidly, and new
vessels are being ordered to construct and operate
the wind farms. KONGSBERG is in a position to
secure contracts in this segment in the coming
years too.

‘The merchant marine market ranges from simple
dry cargo ships to advanced tankers. Passenger-
carrying cruise ships and ferries are also an impor-
tant part of the merchant fleet. Newbuilding orders
are closely linked to the expected development in
transport needs. Changes in the world economy
affect the need to transport people, energy, raw
materials and finished products by sea. As a result,
the demand for new vessels is cyclical and varies
over time. There is currently uncertainty in the

market related to economic prospects, future fuel
developments, commodity prices and shipyard
capacity. While this may negatively affect new-
building orders for a period, it also creates new
opportunities and the need for innovative techno-
logical solutions.

In the defence market, products and systems are
supplied for land-, air- and sea-based defence. Due
to strict security requirements and the protection
of the different countries’ own defence industries,
it is often difficult for a defence contractor to win,
defence contracts outside its own country. There is
considerable protectionism in Europe, the US and
the defence market in general. Nevertheless, there
are opportunities via long-term relationships and
niche products, and these are partly safeguarded
through our relationships with several large foreign
defence companies. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
has led to security rising on the agenda, and this
has increased the demand for surveillance and
defence equipment.

KONGSBERG mainly operates in markets that are
greatly influenced by technological developments
and where there is a risk that new technology may
affect our leading position. We annually invest
considerable amounts to develop both new and
existing products in order to take new, and
maintain existing, market positions. General
economic-cycle fluctuations will also affect the
markets - to varying degrees and at different times.
Export-control regulations and sanctions may
entail uncertainty regarding market opportunities.

In 2022, the focus on limiting exports of technology
products through export-control regulations
continued. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the
subsequent sanctions against Russia have present-
ed new challenges. Together with the ongoing trade
war between the US and China, this means that the
risks associated with restrictions on market access
and sanctions have increased.

We deliver systems and solutions with high techno-
logical complexity, and the deliveries are mainly
organised as projects. Effective project manage-
ment is therefore an important factor in reducing
risk. KONGSBERG has established project-
management goals based on internal and external
best practice, and project managers undergo
training programmes. The projects’ revenues are
primarily contractually agreed, and the uncertainty
in the projects is largely related to the assessment
of remaining costs and determination of the
completion rate, as well as the counterparty risk
and guarantee obligations. The Group has estab-
lished principles for categorising projects in terms
of technological complexity and development
content. This forms the basis for assessing the
execution risk and profit to be recognised in the
projects.

KONGSBERG is exposed to financial uncertainty
through currency risk, interest-rate risk, credit risk,
liquidity risk and climate risk. The aim is to reduce
the financial risk and thus improve predictability in
the Group. Our financial risk is managed centrally
in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the

Board in the Group’s financial policy. The Group’s
financial risk management is described in Note 4

to the annual financial statements, ‘Management

of capital and financial risks’. Our customer base is
diversified and consists mainly of public-sector
enterprises and large private companies ina
number of countries. Historically, the Group has
had low losses on accounts receivable from custom-
ers, Measures to limit risk exposure are implement-
ed when the administration deems these necessary.
‘The Group's liquidity risk is managed centrally
through loan-refinancing and available-capital
requirements, as well as the use of liquidity fore-
casts.

With a high share of net income in currencies other
than the Norwegian krone, KONGSBERG is exposed
to fluctuations in foreign-exchange markets. Efforts
are made to reduce the currency risk through the
exercise of the Group’s financial policy, which states
that contracts over a certain size must be currency
hedged when they are entered into. These are
mainly hedged using forward currency contracts
(fair value hedges). In special cases, the Group uses
forward contracts as cash-flow hedges, for example
in the case of large tenders where there is a high
probability that KONGSBERG will win the contract.
In addition, currency options are used to some
extent.

KONGSBERG has large book values on its balance

sheet that are justified by future cash flows.

A reduction in cash flows could affect the value of

the assets. In 2016, KONGSBERG acquired 49.9 per

cent of the shares in Finnish company Patria, which
at 31 December 2022 had a book value of MNOK
3,036. A persistent weakening of Patria’s results
may make it challenging to defend the book values.
During 2022, KONGSBERG acquired NanoAvionics,
a Lithuanian manufacturer of small-scale satellites,
for MNOK S05, as well as Interconsult Bulgaria
(ICB) and Visavi (Norway), both software develop-
ment consultancies, for MNOK 101 and MNOK 9
respectively. Significant amounts of the excess
value of these acquisitions have been added to
goodwill. See Notes 5, 14 and 15 to the financial
statements for details.

KONGSBERG is exposed to climate-related finan-
cial risk and works systematically to identify risks
and opportunities relating to climate changes and
the transition to a low-emission society. The risk
assessments are an integral part of the company’s
central management and reporting of risks and are
used as a basis for strategy, product and business
developments. KONGSBERG reports in accordance
with the recommendations of the Task Force on
Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and
further details can be found in chapter 3.

In addition to climate, we consider the transition to
a circular economy, sustainable supplier chains,
human rights and anti-corruption measures as
being financially material environmental, social
and governance (ESG) factors for KONGSBERG. The
new materiality analysis process, in line with the
double materiality principle, was completed
towards the end of 2022. In 2023, we will consider

whether all the financially material ESG factors
have been fully integrated into the Group’s manage-
ment ofits strategy and risks.

KONGSBERG has built up and further developed
compliance functions over several years. Regula-
tions, as well as follow-up and reporting systems,
have been established to manage risk in areas such
as anti-corruption, export controls and sanctions,
human rights, supply chains and whistleblowing.
Training in the area of ethics and compliance is
provided throughout the organisation, both in
Norway and abroad.

We conduct external evaluations of our compliance
and anti-corruption programme every three years,
and did so most recently in 2020. The Board
considers KONGSBERG’s compliance programme
to be at a very good level.

Asa high-tech company, KONGSBERG is constantly
exposed to data-security threats, and is under
constant pressure from various external players.
Essentially, we are subject to computer virus
attacks and attempts at hacking, social engineering
and fraud. The management prioritises and pays
close attention to monitoring and other measures
to prevent us from being compromised. In order to
be as well-equipped as possible for this type of
threat, we have established Kongsberg Cyber
Security Center and cooperate closely with
Norway’s National Security Authority and several
leading competence environments, such as the
Forum of Incidence Response and Security Teams.

Together with information to and the training of all
employees, this helps the Group to continuously
improve its ability to withstand these threats.

‘The risk of physical attacks on locations and
employees is considered to be lower than the risk
of cyber attacks, but we conduct risk assessments
continuously and implement security measures
where necessary.

Technology and product
development

KONGSBERG develops and delivers high-tech
solutions both in Norway and abroad. Our technol-
ogy platform has been systematically built up over
many years and is an important prerequisite for
our competitiveness. The transfer of technology
between the different parts of the Group is very
valuable. Sustainable innovation is an important,
part of the Group’s business strategy and
KONGSBERG has developed and invested consider-
ably in future-oriented technology expertise in
digitisation. We are also actively working together
with our key technology partners to further develop
our technology platform. KONGSBERG continuous-
ly invests in product and system development,
both self-financed and through customer-funded
programmes. In total, the Group spends about

10 per cent of its operating revenues on product

development over time. This includes both self-
financed and customer-financed developments.

The total self-financed product development
and maintenance work amounted to MNOK 1,980
in 2022, of which MNOK 305 was capitalised.

At 31 December 2022, the capitalised own-
development work equalled a total of MNOK 1,262
for KONGSBERG.

The Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace business
area has the largest share of the capitalised own-
development projects in KONGSBERG. These
comprise technology relating to weapon stations,
missile systems, control systems and communica-
tion equipment.

Kongsberg Maritime’s self-financed development
projects mainly comprise many projects with a
limited total scope, and to a large extent relate to
the development of existing technology. Most of
these development projects do not meet the criteria
for capitalisation of development costs.

Kongsberg Digital has ongoing development
projects whose capitalisation is linked to the
development of the digital platform Kognifai and
associated applications.

Sustainability and ESG

KONGSBERG shall represent sustainable develop-
ment, with a balance between results, value
creation and environmental, social and governance
(ESG) factors. Sustainability and ESG are integral
parts of the Group's strategy processes. Sustainable
value creation and innovation are key elements in
helping to solve the major global challenges facing
the world. For us, this means business opportuni-
ties in several markets in light of our broad technol-
ogy and competence platform. We are aware of the
risks associated with our licence to operate - with

regard to compliance with laws and regulations,
changes in resource scarcity, unrest in the global
situation, developments in global megatrends and
suchlike. We have, and will continue to have, a
focus on anti-corruption and corporate social
responsibility as regards our suppliers and part-
ners, as well as on following up human and labour
rights in both our own organisation and our
business partners’ organisations.

In 2022, the Group conducted a new materiality
analysis in accordance with the double materiality
principle in order to identify, assess and prioritise
its most important ESG topics, including risks and

opportunities. Refer to the annual report’s sustain-
ability chapter for a more detailed description of

the Group’s work on sustainability and ESG factors.

Respect for human rights is key to sustainable
development. In KONGSBERG, this is enshrined in
our governing documents. We are committed to
identifying, preventing and mitigating any adverse
consequences related to our business activities,

for our employees, in our supply chain, for our
business partners and where we operate. We will
publish an account of the specific due diligence
assessments on our website by 30 June 2023.

According to section 3-3c of the Norwegian Ac-
counting Act, the company must prepare a corpo-
rate social responsibility statement. We refer to
that stated about the environment, social factors
and corporate governance in the annual report’s
sustainability chapter.

Ethics, integrity and compliance

When carrying out all activities, we are committed
to complying with our values and high standards
of safety, ethics and quality, and this is also report-
ed in our quality management system. The Board
believes that such a commitment is fundamental
to running a healthy, successful and sustainable
business. Significant resources are devoted to
maintaining a comprehensive global ethics and
compliance programme designed to prevent and
deter, as well as detect and handle, any violations

of laws, our business-ethics guidelines and other
important regulations and governance documents
applicable to the company.

Climate and environment

The climate and environmental accounts provide
an overview of KONGSBERG’s energy consumption,
greenhouse gas emissions and waste management.
The Group’s biggest positive contribution to

limit climate changes is through its deliveries of
products and solutions that contribute to reduced
emissions for our customers. This is a key part of,
our business strategy.

In 2021, we committed to setting targets to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations,
including our supply chain, in order to contribute
to the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global
warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in accordance with
the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In 2022,
the Group further developed these climate goals
and documented how they are to be achieved in an
application for approval by SBTi. The goals are
described in the chapter on climate on pages 74-91
of this report. This also contains a detailed over-
view and description of the climate and environ-
mental accounts for 2022. Our ambition for the
period up to 2030 is to reduce our own greenhouse
gas emissions from the use of oil and gas by 55 per
cent and from our own use of electricity by 25 per
cent through energy efficiency and technical
upgrades. Furthermore, electricity purchases must

have a guarantee that they originate from a renewa-
ble energy source. We aim to reduce emissions from
transport and distribution by 25 per cent and from
our own business travel by 30 per cent. In addition,
we aim for at least two-thirds of our suppliers to set
their own science-based targets for their operations
within five years.

No serious incidents related to pollution of the
environment were reported in 2022.

In 2022, the Group considered nature and natural
diversity to be an important topic that includes
risks and opportunities for the company. In 2023
and beyond, we will conduct risk assessments and
develop our approach and strategy to minimise
negative effects and increase the positive effects in
accordance with recognised standards and the
Convention on Biological Diversity.

Health, safety and the
environment

At KONGSBERG, we put life and health first, and
will never compromise on the health and safety of
our employees, customers or partners in our global
operations. To achieve this goal, we work continu-
ously, openly and pre-emptively to build a strong
health, safety and environmental (HSE) culture at
all levels of the organisation. It is our responsibility,

in cooperation with the management, to ensure
a safe and prudent working environment in
KONGSBERG, and we are convinced that this also
contributes to increased efficiency and wellbeing,
as well as to lower operating costs. In 2022,
KONGSBERG established a new HSE directive, in
which best practices, expectations and manage-
ment principles are defined to support our ‘Vision
Zero’ - zero accidents and injuries.

In KONGSBERG, safety must always come first. Our
employees and partners have been mandated to
stop work that is a threat to life and health. We
actively strive to increase safety in the workplace
through systematic risk reduction, and we encour-
age the organisation to map and report high-risk
incidents, as well as to share experiences and best
practices - which is especially important regarding
incidents with a high injury potential. All personal
injuries and high-risk incidents are investigated to
determine the underlying causes and to share best
practices with the organisation. We need to under-
stand the conditions and situations that have
triggered the incident so that similar incidents can
be prevented. We believe in collaboration and that
everyone must contribute to the HSE work, but our
managers have the overall responsibility. The
corporate executive management has been contin-
uously updated about the HSE results and any
challenges as well as about personal injuries and
high-risk incidents. HSE reporting is an important
part of our follow-up in this area, and active efforts
are being made to increase the number of reports.
Everyone who works for KONGSBERG must

contribute to reporting dangerous conditions,
near-misses and accidents. In 2022, 3,051 HSE
reports were submitted, All employees, including
contract workers, are to receive relevant HSE
training with information on the rules, require-
ments and risks.

The number of personal injuries was reduced in
2022. The number of lost-time and non-lost-time
work-related incidents fell from 2.23 per million
hours worked in 2021 to 2.01 per million hours
worked in 2022. In most of the personal injury
cases, the injuries were limited. Preventive meas-
ures have been introduced on an ongoing basis.

We see that sickness absence has increased since
the pandemic. We are therefore working closely on
follow-up and prevention, as well as on mapping
any post-COVID effects. We also seek experience
and best practice outside our own organisation.
The Group’s total sickness-absence rate increased
from 3.0 per cent in 2021 to 3.6 per cent in 2022. For
the operations in Norway, the sickness-absence rate
is 4.5 per cent, up from 3.2 per cent in 2021. Those
on sick leave are systematically followed up. All
employees in Norway have access to the company
health service. In the foreign enterprises, this varies
in line with local practice and legislation. At the
end of 2022, 40 per cent of KONGSBERG’s employ-
ees worked outside Norway. This means we must
pay great attention to, and have a lot of insight into,
HSE issues in the countries in question.

Mental health is important to us, which is why we
have continued last year’s campaign where we
talked about the importance of working on condi-
tions that improve mental health - both at work
and in our spare time.

On World Day for Employees with Disabilities, we
rolled out a campaign on the themes of inclusion,
collaboration and facilitation. All colleagues are
equally important to KONGSBERG. We are one
team, and we take care of each other no matter
what.

All the business areas have established HSE
processes and guidelines to reduce risk and exploit
opportunities, with support from ongoing HSE
audits to map the compliance status and further
opportunities for improvement. In 2022, ten HSE
audits were carried out in the business areas. The
results of all the audits have helped to improve
overall HSE processes and share best practices.

Further details on key sustainability figures relating
to HSE can be found in the Group’s Sustainability

Report, page 105.

The Board monitors the HSE work closely and
reviews the HSE reports every quarter.

ina sustainable way. Good, clear and shared values
lead to good conduct that yields commercial
results. KONGSBERG has clear common denomina-
tors and these are expressed and experienced in the
same way wherever we work.

In KONGSBERG, management is about creating
value and achieving results through others. The key
to success lies in the combination of good leader-
ship and dedicated employees. The manager is to
exercise leadership based on our values, ethical
guidelines and management principles. Our
managers must create an environment where our
employees will thrive and succeed in meeting the
strategic priorities of customer satisfaction,
innovation and operational excellence. Based on
this, we have Leadership@KONGSBERG, which is
intended to help clarify and quality assure goal-
setting, goal follow-up and evaluation processes for
all our employees.

KONGSBERG’s management of its employees’
competence is an important prerequisite for
long-term success. The Group is working to in-
crease the exchange of knowledge and employees
between the business areas. Good work processes
and development opportunities are important tools
for recruiting and retaining good employees.
KONGSBERG attaches great importance to compe-
tence development and makes continuous efforts to
further develop its employees.

Cooperation with employee unions and organisa-
tions through the established cooperation and

representation schemes is good and makes valuable
contributions to dealing with the Group’s challeng-
es in a constructive manner.

The company is committed to promoting gender
equality and preventing discrimination in violation
of the Norwegian Gender Equality Act. Short- and
long-term goals have been established to help
increase the proportion of women in the Group,
with regard to both appointments and management
positions. The number of female employees rose to
21 per cent, from 20 per cent in 2021. The percent-
age of female managers on levels 1-3 also rose and
was 26 per cent in 2022.

‘To the extent possible, KONGSBERG seeks to adapt
working conditions so that people with disabilities
can also be employed by the company. Diversity is
particularly followed up by the Board’s Compensa-
tion Committee. The Board considers that the Group
complies with applicable regulations in this area.

See pages 116-123 of this report for a more detailed
discussion of the Group’s work on diversity and
equality.

Corporate governance

KONGSBERG aims to safeguard and increase
stakeholder value by pursuing profitable, growth-
oriented industrial development in a long-term,
sustainable and international perspective. Good
corporate governance shall reduce the risk associat-
ed with the business, while at the same time
utilising the Group’s resources in an efficient and

sustainable manner, thereby ensuring the greatest
possible value creation. The value created shall
benefit shareholders, employees, customers and
society at large. The Board attaches importance to
ensuring that the Group’s governing documents are
reviewed annually and updated so that they are in
so far as possible in accordance with the Norwegian
Code of Practice for Corporate Governance.

Pursuant to section 3-3b of the Norwegian Account-
ing Act, the company must prepare a corporate
governance statement. In accordance with section
5-6 of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies
Act, this statement will be discussed at the Annual
General Meeting. The statement in chapter 4 of the
annual report is based on the latest revised version
of the Code of Practice dated 14 October 2021.

Directors’ liability insurance

Kongsberg Gruppen ASA has taken out a directors’
liability insurance policy that is applicable to the
Group’s Board members, CEO and senior execu-
tives. The directors’ liability insurance covers legal
financial claims against the Board or management
arising from actions by the Board or management.
The insurance is valid for the parent company and
all KONGSBERG subsidiaries in which KONGSBERG
owns more than 50 per cent. The insurance is
placed with a reputable insurance company with a
good rating.

Salary and other remuneration
to executive management

The Board has a separate Compensation Committee
that, among other things, considers all material
matters relating to salary and other remuneration
to executive management before formal Board
deliberations and decisions. In accordance with
Norwegian company legislation, the Board has also
prepared a separate report entitled ‘Report on

the remuneration of executive management in
KONGSBERG 2022’, which will be published at the
same time as the notice of the Annual General
Meeting.

Profit for the year and its
allocation

‘The operations of Kongsberg Gruppen ASA mainly
consist of providing group services to subsidiaries
and carrying out other administrative tasks.

The revenues in 2022 came to MNOK 201, compared
to MNOK 243 in 2021. The profit for the year was
MNOK 2357 in 2022, compared to MNOK 5,782 in
2021. This change is due to a considerably lower
Group contribution in 2022 than in 2021.
