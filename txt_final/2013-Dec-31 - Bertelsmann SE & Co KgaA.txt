Group Management Report

Financial Year 2013 in Review

Bertelsmann achieved positive performance in financial year 2013. In implementing the strategy,
significant progress was made in all four strategic priorities: strengthening the core businesses,
driving forward the digital transformation, developing growth platforms and expanding in growth
regions. Group revenues from continuing operations rose 1.8 percent to €16.4 billion (previous year:
€16.1 billion). This was largely attributable to portfolio effects, in particular, the merger of Penguin
and Random House and the acquisitions of BMG and Gothia Financial Group. Operating EBITDA
increased to €2,313 million (previous year: €2,210 million). Despite investments in digitization projects
and start-up losses for new businesses, operating EBIT of €1,754 million was slightly above the
previous year’s high level (previous year: €1,732 million). Growth in the German television business
was offset by the negative impact on earnings also from structurally declining businesses. Return

on sales was 10.7 percent (previous year: 10.8 percent). Group profit increased significantly to

€870 million from €612 million in the previous year. Total investments including acquired financial
debt in the reporting period increased to €2.0 billion (previous year: €0.7 billion). The net financial

debt at year-end fell by half to €636 million (previous year: €1,218 million) thanks to proceeds from

the placement of RTL Group shares and a high level of operating cash flow. The progress in the

implementation of the strategy will have a positive impact on the ongoing business performance.

Bertelsmann expects the positive business development to continue in financial year 2014.

Strategy

As an international media group, Bertelsmann occupies lead-
ing market positions in its core sectors of television, books,
newspapers, services and print. Bertelsmann’s primary objec-
tive is continuous growth of the company’s value through a
sustained increase in profitability (see section “Value-Oriented
Management System”).

Bertelsmann aims to achieve a faster-growing, more digital
and more international Group portfolio. As well as invest-
ments in existing activities, new business segments are
being increasingly explored that supplement the established
businesses and provide a broader overall revenue structure.
The further development of the portfolio is subject to clear
investment criteria. Businesses in which Bertelsmann invests
should have long-term stable growth, global reach, stable and
protectable business models, high market entry barriers and
scalability. The Group currently has two main earnings pillars,
media and services, with a third supporting pillar, education,
due to be added in the medium term. Group strategy com-
prises four strategic priorities, which constituted the key work
aspects for the Executive Board in 2013: strengthening core
businesses (in particular, investments in creative businesses,
exploiting opportunities for consolidation); driving forward
the digital transformation of all core businesses; develop-
ing growth platforms in the divisions (in particular, Financial
Services and TV production) and at the Group level (music
rights and education); and expanding in growth regions
(China, India and Brazil).

In financial year 2013, Bertelsmann made progress in all four
strategic priorities. For example, RTL Group expanded its
families of channels and the production business. The book
publishing business was strengthened through the merger of
Random House and Penguin Group to form the world’s largest
trade book publisher. Bertelsmann holds the majority of shares
in the new publishing group (53 percent). Gruner + Jahr com-
pleted a restructuring of the company according to defined

64 Financial Information Group Management Report

Communities of Interest. Arvato was reorganized into Solution
Groups and countries on the basis of a multidimensional
structure, thus strengthening interdivisional cooperation as
well as the key account management for its most important
customers. The consolidation measures were intensified in
structurally declining businesses, such as Be Printers and
the Club and Direct Marketing activities. These measures
included, for example, the announced closure of the Prinovis
Itzehoe location in April 2014.

Bertelsmann is making significant progress in driving forward
the digital transformation. In 2013, RTL Group’s online offer-
ings generated a total of 16.8 billion video views. Through
a strategic partnership with the Canadian multichannel
network BroadbandTV, RTL Group became the third-
largest provider on YouTube (excluding music video services).
Penguin Random House now offers more than 77,000 titles as
e-books worldwide. As part of the organizational interlinking
of print and online, Gruner + Jahr has strengthened its com-
mitment to e-magazines, apps and mobile offerings. Arvato
continued to benefit from the expansion of its digital services
for customers in the IT, high-tech and e-commerce sectors.

The development of the growth platforms was successfully
continued. In the reporting period, Bertelsmann completed the
full acquisition of the music rights group BMG and expanded
it. Signings of top-level artists such as Mick Jagger and Keith
Richards from the Rolling Stones as well as Robbie Williams
and the Backstreet Boys contributed to the expansion. Arvato
acquired the financial services provider Gothia. The education
business was expanded.

Progress was also achieved with the regional expansion in
growth regions. RTL Group expanded into Southeast Asia
in conjunction with CBS. In the book publishing segment,
Bertelsmann strengthened its presence in China, India and
Latin America through the merger of Penguin and Random
House. Arvato achieved further profitable growth with its
services in China. The investment fund Bertelsmann Asia
Investments expanded its investment portfolio and achieved a
very positive value performance.

Bertelsmann generated revenues of around €1.5 billion by
placing a total of 25.5 million RTL Group shares in 2013, while
retaining a participation level of over 75 percent.

In 2014, Bertelsmann will pursue the four strategic priorities
mentioned. The success of Bertelsmann in the future will
continue to be driven by content-based and entrepreneurial
creativity, which is why the Group continues to invest in the
creative core of its businesses. In addition, Bertelsmann needs
to have qualified employees at all levels of the Group to ensure
its strategic and financial success. The compliance with and


--- Page 4 ---

achievement of the strategic development priorities are
continuously examined by the Executive Board at divisional
level through regular meetings of the Strategy and Business
Committee and as part of the annual Strategic Planning Dialog
between the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. In
addition, relevant markets and the competitive environment
are analyzed on an ongoing basis in order to draw conclu-
sions concerning the further development of the Group's
strategy. The Executive Board is also supported by the Group
Management Committee (GMC) on issues of corporate strat-
egy and development. This Committee is composed of execu-
tives representing key businesses, countries, regions and
selected Group-wide functions.

Value-Oriented Management System

Bertelsmann’s primary objective is continuous growth of the
company’s value through a sustained increase in profitability.
In order to manage the Group, Bertelsmann has been using
a value-oriented management system for many years, which
focuses on revenues, operating earnings and optimum capital
investment. For formal reasons, Bertelsmann makes a distinc-
tion between strictly defined and broadly defined operational
performance indicators.

Strictly defined operational performance indicators, includ-
ing revenues, operating EBIT as well as the Bertelsmann
Value Added (BVA), are used to directly assess current busi-
ness performance and are correspondingly used in the out-
look. These are distinguished from performance indicators
used in the broader sense, which are partially derived from
the above-mentioned indicators or are strongly influenced by
these. These include the return on sales and the cash con-
version rate. The financial management system with defined
internal financing targets is also part of the broadly defined

value-oriented management system. Broadly defined perfor-
mance indicators are — if they are used at all — only voluntary
predictions that are not included in the outlook as they are not
directly relevant for management purposes.

Strictly defined operational performance indicators

In order to control and manage the Group, Bertelsmann uses
revenues, operating EBIT and BVA as performance indicators.
Revenue is used as a growth indicator of businesses. In financial
year 2013, Group revenues rose 1.8 percent to €16.4 billion
(previous year: €16.1 billion). Operating EBIT serves as an indi-
cator of the profitability of the operating businesses. Operating
EBIT is calculated before interest and taxes and adjusted for
special items. This procedure yields a normalized, sustainable
indicator of performance that helps to improve predictability
and comparability. In the reporting period, operating EBIT of
€1,754 million was slightly above the previous year's high
level (previous year: €1,732 million).

Bertelsmann uses BVA for assessing the profitability of
operations and return on invested capital. BVA measures the
profit realized above and beyond the appropriate return on
invested capital. This form of value orientation is reflected in
strategic investment and portfolio planning and the manage-
ment of Group operations and, together with qualitative
criteria, forms the basis for measuring the variable portion of
management compensation. BVA is calculated as the differ-
ence between net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) and the
cost of capital. NOPAT is calculated as operating EBIT after
modifications and less a flat 33-percent tax. Cost of capital is
the product of the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
and the level of capital invested. The uniform WACC after taxes
is 8 percent. Invested capital is calculated on the basis of the
Group's operating assets less non-interest-bearing operating
liabilities. The present value of operating leases is also taken

into account when calculating the invested capital. BVA in
financial year 2013 was €283 million compared with the previ-
ous year's figure of €362 million. The decline is mainly attribut-
able to the increased acquisition activity and the revaluations
carried out in the course of company transactions.

Broadly defined performance indicators

In order to assess business development, other perfor-
mance indicators are used that are partially derived from
revenues and operating EBIT or are strongly influenced by
these figures.

The cash conversion rate serves as a measure of cash gen-
erated from business activities and is calculated as the ratio
of operating free cash flow to operating EBIT. Operating free
cash flow does not reflect interest, tax or dividend payments,
is lowered by operating investments such as replacement and
expansion investments as well as changes in working capital,
and is adjusted for special items. The Group aims to maintain
a cash conversion rate of 90 to 100 percent as a long-term
average. The cash conversion rate in financial year 2013 was
100 percent (previous year: 107 percent) and therefore within
the target corridor.

The return on sales is calculated as the ratio of operating
EBIT to revenues, which is used as an additional criterion for
assessing the business performance. Bertelsmann aims to
achieve return on sales of at least 10 percent at Group level.
Return on sales in financial year 2013 was 10.7 percent (previ-
ous year: 10.8 percent).

In view of the Bertelsmann Group's growth strategy and
the associated expansion of investment activity, it will focus
more closely on operating EBITDA. In this context, operating
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes and
depreciation, and is adjusted for special items. As operating
EBITDA is not distorted by the accounting-related effects of
acquisitions, it is a meaningful earnings indicator, which is
also used as a standard internationally and has been intro-
duced on the capital markets.

Bertelsmann’s financial management and controlling system is
defined by the internal financial targets outlined in the section
“Net Assets and Financial Position.” These financing principles
are pursued in the management of the Group and are included
in the broadly defined value-oriented management system.

The non-financial performance indicators (employees, cor-
porate responsibility and innovations) are not included in the
broadly defined value-oriented management system. As the
non-financial performance indicators can only be measured to
a limited extent, they are not significant for the management
of the Group as it is not possible to make any clear statements
concerning interrelated effects and increased value.

Overall Economic Developments

The global economy in 2013 reflected the moderate growth
level of the previous year. Real GDP increased by 2.9 percent
in 2013 compared with a rise of 3.1 percent in 2012. While ten-
sions eased on the international financial markets, economic
expansion in the threshold countries remained sluggish.

The US economy continues to follow a gradual path of recov-
ery. According to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, real
GDP in the United States in 2013 was 1.9 percent compared
with 2.8 percent in 2012. Growth stimuli were provided pri-
marily by the expansion of private consumer spending, private
asset investments and exports.

The euro zone came out of the recession over the course of
2013. However, the European debt crisis has not yet been
resolved, and the economic situation in the euro zone remains
fragile. According to the Statistical Office of the European
Union, real GDP fell by 0.5 percent in 2013, having fallen
0.7 percent in 2012.

After a weak start to the year, the German economy began
to pick up during 2013. Overall, according to the Federal
Statistical Office, real GDP increased by 0.4 percent in 2013
compared with a rise of 0.7 percent in 2012. Domestic
stimuli played a key role in the turnaround at the end of the
year. Private consumption benefited from favorable employ-
ment and income prospects and the ongoing low-interest
environment.

Developments in Relevant Markets

The following analysis pertains only to markets and regions of
a sufficient size if their trend can be adequately aggregated
and is important for the business development of Bertelsmann
businesses.

With the exception of Germany, the European TV advertising
markets largely declined in 2013.

The German- and Spanish-language book markets proved
mostly stable overall in 2013. The book markets in the United
States and the UK showed a slight decline after the excep-
tional bestseller performance of the previous year. The global
growth of e-books continued. Germany, in particular, recorded
significant growth, while growth in the United States and the
UK declined slightly.

In 2013, the magazine markets in Germany, France, Spain
and China were characterized by sharply falling advertising
markets in some areas. Magazine sales in the core Euro-
pean countries declined due to a downward trend in cir-
culations.


--- Page 6 ---

The service markets (CRM, SCM, Financial Services, IT Services
and Digital Marketing) achieved positive growth. By contrast,
the storage media markets declined significantly worldwide
due to the increasing importance of electronic forms of
distribution.

Overall, the European print markets for magazines, cata-
logs and promotional materials declined in 2013 due to the
ongoing pressure on prices and volumes. Likewise, the print
market for books in North America continued to decline
in 2013.

Regulatory Environment

Bertelsmann has television and radio operations in several
European countries that are subject to regulation. In Ger-
many, for example, media are subject to oversight by the
Commission on Concentration in the Media. Bertelsmann
Group companies occupy leading market positions in many
lines of business and may therefore have limited potential for
growth through acquisition due to antitrust legislation.

As its profit participation certificates and bonds are pub-
licly listed, Bertelsmann is required to comply in full with
capital market regulations applicable to publicly traded
companies.

Significant Events in the Financial Year

On January 1, 2013, Christoph Mohn became the new Chair-
man of the Supervisory Board of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
and of the Supervisory Board of Bertelsmann Management SE.
In both positions, Christoph Mohn succeeded Gunter Thielen,
who resigned from the Supervisory Board upon reaching
retirement age as of the end of 2012.

In February 2013, the Prinovis group, which is part of
Be Printers, announced the closure of its gravure printing
facility in Itzehoe. The continued difficult situation in the
European gravure printing market as a result of continued
pressure on prices and lower volumes were key issues behind
the closure decision. The negotiations concerning the com-
pensation and redundancy package were agreed in June 2013.
As part of the compensation package, it was agreed to cease
production in Itzehoe as of April 30, 2014.

At the end of March 2013, Bertelsmann concluded the
full acquisition of the music rights company BMG Rights
Management after the deal was approved by the antitrust
authorities. In this regard, Bertelsmann acquired the remain-
ing shares it had not previously held and since then has car-
ried BMG Rights Management as a wholly owned subsidiary.
There were further artist signings and takeovers of music
catalogs in the reporting period.

On April 1, 2013, Achim Berg simultaneously became CEO of
Arvato AG and a member of the Executive Board of Bertelsmann
Management SE. Achim Berg thereby succeeded Rolf Buch
who had resigned as head of Arvato and had also resigned his
Executive Board mandate for Bertelsmann Management SE as
of the end of 2012. In fall 2013, Berg announced a reorganization
of Arvato. The businesses are organized according to Solution
Groups and countries on the basis of a multidimensional struc-
ture. In addition, a central Key Account Management depart-
ment has been introduced for key customers. The aim of the
new organizational structure is to promote innovation,
internationality, cooperation and the transfer of knowledge
within Arvato.

At the end of April 2013, Bertelsmann placed 23.5 million
RTL Group shares at a price of €55.50 per share. The pro-
ceeds from the reduction of the shareholding will be used to
implement Bertelsmann’s growth strategy. The share capital of
RTL Group was admitted for trading on the Prime Standard
of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and in September 2013
was listed on the German MDAX index. In October 2013,
Bertelsmann placed an additional 2 million RTL Group shares,
which originated from the non-exercised over-allotment option,
at a price of €75.81 per share. Bertelsmann remains the clear
majority shareholder in RTL Group with a 75.1-percent stake
in share capital.

In June 2013, Bertelsmann announced that the operations of
the direct marketing company Inmediaone would be gradually
closed down and that it would cease trading in mid-2014 due
to a lack of economic prospects.

In mid-June 2013, Arvato completed the acquisition of Gothia
Financial Group and has since been in the process of merging
the existing financial services business of its subsidiary Arvato
Infoscore with that of Gothia. The merger will strengthen the
growth businesses in the area of Financial Services and will
help make Arvato's businesses more international.

On July 1, 2013, the Penguin Random House merger was
completed. Bertelsmann and Pearson had already announced
their intention to combine the activities of their respec-
tive book publishing companies, Random House (with the
exception of the German-language publishing business)
and Penguin Group, in October 2012. Bertelsmann holds a
53-percent interest in the new trade book publishing group
Penguin Random House, with Pearson holding 47 percent.
Penguin Random House comprises all of the publishing units
of Random House and the Penguin Group in the United States,
Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, India and South
Africa as well as the Random House publishers in Spain and
Latin America and the Penguin businesses in the Asian region
and Germany. Reviews by the authorities in several countries
around the world preceded the closing of the merger.

In August 2013, the cooperation between RTL Group and
CBS Studios International in the new company RTL CBS Asia
Entertainment Network and the joint launch of two pay-TV
channels in Southeast Asia were announced. The two chan-
nels will broadcast in English and local languages in several
Asian markets and will be transmitted in high-resolution HD
standard via cable, satellite and Internet TV.

In December 2013, the disposal of the Czech-Slovakian book
and publishing house Euromedia Group to the Czech invest-
ment firm Arraviet was agreed. The transaction includes

Revenue Development

Group revenues from continuing operations rose 1.8 percent
in financial year 2013 to €16.4 billion (previous year:
€16.1 billion). The strategic portfolio expansions through the
merger of Penguin and Random House as well as the full
takeover of BMG (Corporate Investments) and the acquisition
of Gothia (Arvato) resulted in increased revenues. Adjusted
for portfolio and exchange rate effects, the Group's organic
growth was -2.8 percent. The exchange rate effects were
-1.2 percent; portfolio and other effects were 5.8 percent. The
organic revenue decline is attributable to the extraordinarily
strong previous year at Random House, the weak European
advertising markets overall, the impact of structurally declin-
ing businesses and deliberately managed revenue develop-
ment at Arvato.

Revenues at RTL Group were down 1.9 percent to €5,889 mil-
lion (previous year: €6,002 million) in the reporting period. The
positive development of Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland and
RTL Nederland partially offset the decline at Fremantle Media.
As a result of the merger with Penguin on July 1, 2013,
and the acquisition of the remaining shares in Random
House Mondadori on January 1, 2013, revenues at Penguin
Random House were 23.9 percent above the previous year
at €2,655 million (previous year: €2,142 million). Adjusted for
these portfolio effects, organic revenues at Penguin Random
House declined as the previous year had been largely char-
acterized by the bestseller performance of the “Fifty Shades”
trilogy. Revenues at Gruner + Jahr were down 6.9 percent to
€2,065 million (previous year: €2,218 million). The lower rev-
enues are partly attributable to portfolio effects from the partial
closure of the business media publishing division and the sale
of G+J Poland. In addition, the advertising and circulation busi-
ness posted declining revenues particularly in France, Austria,

Spain and China. This is counteracted by revenue growth from
the digital businesses. Arvato’s revenues remained stable
at €4,414 million (previous year: €4,419 million). Financial
Services and the CRM and IT Services units showed posi-
tive development. By contrast, replication at Arvato posted a
fall in revenues due to the general declining market develop-
ment and the disposal of the replication activities in Brazil.
Impacted further by the structural decline of the print busi-
nesses, revenue at Be Printers declined by 7.5 percent to
€1,123 million (previous year: €1,214 million). Revenues at
Corporate Investments, despite declining revenues in the Club
and Direct Marketing activities, increased by 23.6 percent to
€582 million (previous year: €471 million) following the full
takeover of BMG.

There were minor changes in the geographical breakdown of
revenues from continuing operations compared to the previ-
ous year. The proportion of revenues generated in Germany
was 34.9 percent compared with 36.1 percent in the previous
year. The revenue share generated by France amounted to
15.4 percent (previous year: 15.8 percent). The share of total rev-
enues generated by the other European countries amounted to
25.5 percent compared with 24.9 percent in the previous year.
The revenue share generated by the United States increased to
17.3 percent (previous year: 16.3 percent) and the other coun-
tries achieved a revenue share of 6.9 percent (previous year:
6.9 percent). This means that the proportion of total revenues
attributable to countries other than Germany rose slightly to
65.1 percent (previous year: 63.9 percent), which is primarily
attributable to strategic portfolio expansions in financial year
2013. Year on year, there was only a slight change in the ratio
of the four revenue streams (own products and merchandise,
advertising, services, rights and licenses) to overall revenue.

Operating EBIT and Operating EBITDA

Bertelsmann achieved operating EBIT of €1,754 million in
financial year 2013 (previous year: €1,732 million). Return
on sales of 10.7 percent was again in the double-digit range
(previous year: 10.8 percent). The earnings reflected the posi-
tive overall business performance and the strategic portfolio
measures implemented in the reporting period. Core busi-
nesses were strengthened, growth platforms developed
and necessary consolidation steps introduced in structurally
declining business units.

RTL Group’s operating EBIT increased by 6.8 percent from
€1,065 million in the previous year to €1,137 million in 2013,
primarily as a result of the improved earnings contribu-
tions of Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland. Penguin Random
House achieved operating EBIT of €309 million compared
with €325 million in the previous year. The growth resulting
from the merger of Penguin and Random House virtually off-
sets the decline in earnings after the strong previous year.
At Gruner + Jahr, operating EBIT fell to €146 million (previ-
ous year: €168 million). The earnings decline is attributable
to falling advertising and circulation revenues particularly in
China, Austria and France, as well as to costs associated with
the accelerated digital transformation. Arvato generated an
operating result of €244 million (previous year: €244 million)
and benefited from improved performances in the CRM and
SCM units. This was contrasted by start-up costs for take-
overs as well as set-up costs for newly acquired customers.

Operating EBIT at Be Printers reduced to €41 million (previous
year: €58 million) as a result of the persistently declining print
market. Earnings from activities grouped under Corporate
Investments came to €-40 million (previous year: €-38 million).

Year on year, operating EBITDA from continuing operations
rose to €2,313 million. The increase of €103 million com-
pared with the previous year's figure of €2,210 million is pri-
marily attributable to RTL Group and Corporate Investments.
Operating EBITDA of Penguin Random House and Arvato
increased slightly year on year in each case. Meanwhile,
operating EBITDA of Gruner + Jahr and Be Printers declined.

Special Items

Special items primarily reflect the strategic measures imple-
mented in the reporting period. The majority of restructuring
expenses relate to structurally declining businesses, in par-
ticular with the imminent closure of the Prinovis location in
Itzehoe. The restructuring expenses also include costs for
the implementation of the new organizational structure of
Gruner + Jahr and Arvato as well as integration costs in con-
nection with the merger of Penguin and Random House. By
contrast, profit of €109 million was recorded from the revalu-
ation of the fair value after the takeover of the remaining BMG
shares as well as a write-up of €72 million on the fair value of
the participation at Atresmedia.

Special items in the reporting period totaled €-46 million
(previous year: €-405 million). They consist of impairments
and reversals on impairments totaling €44 million (previous
year: €-155 million), fair value remeasurement of investments
of €110 million (previous year: €18 million), capital gains of
€111 million (previous year: €12 million) and restructuring
expenses and other special items totaling €-297 million (previ-
ous year: €-288 million). In the reporting period, there were
adjustments to carrying amounts on assets held for sale in the
amount of €-14 million (previous year: €8 million).

EBIT

Adjusting operating EBIT for special items of €-46 million (pre-
vious year: €-405 million) resulted in an EBIT of €1,708 million.
The increase of €381 million from the previous year's figure
of €1,327 million is primarily attributable to the overall lower
burden from special items.

Group Profit or Loss

The year-on-year financial result changed from €-322 million
to €-361 million. The deviation is based on one-time costs of
€40 million for the early repayment of financial debt, which
in future will have a positive impact on the financial result.
The increased tax expenses of €-419 million (previous year:
€-393 million) largely resulted from the improved pre-tax
earnings. This produced after-tax earnings from continu-
ing operations of €928 million (previous year: €612 million).
The after-tax earnings from discontinued operations of
€-58 million (previous year: —) are non-cash follow-on effects
related to the disposal of the Direct Group businesses, which
were formerly shown as discontinued operations. Taking into
account the after-tax earnings from discontinued operations,
this results in a Group profit of €870 million (previous year:
€612 million). This corresponds to an increase of €258 million
compared with the same period in the previous year. The share
held by non-controlling interests was €372 million (previous

year: €135 million). The increase in non-controlling interests
compared with the previous year is primarily attributable to the
reduction of the RTL participation and the Penguin Random
House merger. The share of Group profit held by Bertelsmann
shareholders was €498 million (previous year: €477 million). At
the Annual General Meeting of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA, a
dividend payout of €180 million will be proposed for financial
year 2013 (previous year: €180 million).

Net Assets and Financial Position
Financial Guidelines

The primary objective of Bertelsmann’s financial policy is to
achieve a balance between financial security, return on equity
and growth. For this, Bertelsmann bases its financing policy
on the requirements of a “Baa1/BBB+” credit rating and the
associated qualitative and quantitative criteria. Credit ratings
and capital market transparency make a considerable contri-
bution to the Group's financial security and independence.

In accordance with the Group structure, the capital allocation
is made centrally by Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA, which pro-
vides the Group companies with liquidity and manages the
issuance of guarantees and letters of comfort for them. The
Group consists largely of a single financial unit, thereby opti-
mizing capital procurement and investment opportunities.

Bertelsmann utilizes a financial control system employing
quantitative financial targets concerning the Group’s eco-
nomic debt and, to a lesser extent, its capital structure. One
of the financial targets is a dynamic leverage factor calculated
as the ratio of economic debt to operating EBITDA and limited
to the defined maximum of 2.5. Economic debt is defined as
net financial debt plus provisions for pensions, profit participa-
tion capital and the net present value of operating leases. Like
operating EBITDA, economic debt is modified for calculation
purposes.

As of December 31, 2013, the Group had a leverage factor of
2.0 (December 31, 2012: 2.3). Despite a high level of invest-
ment activity during the reporting period, the net financial
debt at year-end fell by half to €636 million (previous year:
€1,218 million) thanks to proceeds from the placement of
RTL Group shares and a high level of operating cash flow. As
of December 31, 2013, pension provisions of €1,944 million
were also below the previous year’s level (December 31, 2012:
€2,146 million). This means that as of December 31, 2013,
economic debt was reduced to €4,178 million from €4,773 mil-
lion in the previous year.

Another financial target is the coverage ratio. This is calcu-
lated as the ratio of operating EBITDA (after modifications) to
financial result and is supposed to be above 4. In the report-
ing period the coverage ratio was 6.0 (previous year: 6.4). The
Group’s equity ratio was significantly above the self-imposed
minimum of 25 percent and increased to 40.7 percent
(December 31, 2012: 32.2 percent).

Financing Activities

In April 2013, Bertelsmann repaid a tranche of a US private
placement from 2003 of US$200 million on time. In addition,
the tranche of the US private placement falling due in 2015 for
the sum of US$200 million was repaid early in August 2013.
Both US private placements were issued by the US financing
company Bertelsmann U.S. Finance LLC, which in the report-
ing period was merged with Bertelsmann Inc., a US subsidiary
of Bertelsmann. Furthermore, in December 2013 Bertelsmann
repurchased parts of a bond falling due in October 2015 and
another bond falling due in September 2016 for the total nomi-
nal amount of €284 million as part of a public buyback offer
in December 2013. All repayments were made from existing
liquidity.

Rating

Bertelsmann has been rated by the rating agencies Moody's
and Standard & Poor's (S&P) since 2002. The agency ratings
facilitate access to the international capital markets and are
therefore a key element of Bertelsmann’s financial security.
Bertelsmann is rated by Moody's as “Baa1” (outlook: stable)
and by S&P as “BBB+” (outlook: stable). Both credit ratings
are in the investment grade category and meet Bertelsmann’s
target rating. Bertelsmann’s short-term credit quality rating is
“P-2" from Moody's and “A-2” from S&P.

Credit Facilities

The Bertelsmann Group also has access to liquidity via a syn-
dicated loan. This forms the backbone of the strategic credit
reserve, and Bertelsmann can utilize this to draw down up
to €1.2 billion of revolving funds in euros, US dollars and
pounds sterling. In June 2013, the syndicated loan previ-
ously with a term through to 2017 was extended for a
further year, namely until 2018. As in the previous year,
Bertelsmann did not make use of this credit facility in finan-
cial year 2013.

Cash Flow Statement

The total earnings before interest and taxes is the starting
parameter for preparing the Bertelsmann cash flow state-
ment. In the reporting period, Bertelsmann generated net
cash from operating activities of €1,785 million (previous year:
€1,876 million). The Group’s long-term operating free cash
flow adjusted for non-recurring items was €1,760 million (pre-
vious year: €1,861 million), and the cash conversion rate was
100 percent (previous year: 107 percent), within the target
corridor (see the section entitled “Value-Oriented Manage-
ment System”). At €-1,010 million, cash flow from investing
activities was significantly above the level for the previous year
(previous year: €-617 million). This included investments in
intangible assets and fixed and financial assets of €-808 million
(previous year: €-567 million). The purchase prices for consoli-
dated investments (net of acquired cash and cash equivalents)
increased to €-504 million (previous year: €-88 million), particu-
larly as a result of the strategic portfolio expansions made in

€373 million (previous year: €93 million). Cash flow from invest-
ing activities was €-657 million (previous year: €-382 million).
The outflow of €-1,188 million was attributable to the financial
debt of €676 million acquired as part of the acquisition activity
as well as early and scheduled repayments of financial debt.
This was offset by inflows from the placement of RTL Group
shares, which are included in the reported €1,410 million of the
item “Change in equity”. Dividends paid to the shareholders
of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA came to €-180 million (previ-
ous year: €-180 million). Dividends to non-controlling interests
and payments to partners in partnerships came to €-445 million
(previous year: €-213 million). The increase results from the
payment of special dividends by RTL Group in spring and sum-
mer 2013. As of December 31, 2013, Bertelsmann had cash
and cash equivalents of €2.7 billion (previous year: €2.7 billion).

Off-Balance-Sheet Liabilities

The off-balance-sheet liabilities include contingent liabilities and
other financial commitments, almost all of which result from
operating activities conducted by the divisions. Off-balance-
sheet liabilities increased year on year, primarily due to the
strategic portfolio expansions. The off-balance-sheet liabilities
in place as of December 31, 2013 had no significant negative
effects on the Group's net assets, financial position and results
of operation for the past or the future financial year.

Investments.

Total investments including financial debt acquired of €676 mil-
lion amounted to €1,988 million in financial year 2013, sig-
nificantly above the previous year’s figure of €655 million.
Investments according to the cash flow statement amounted
to €1,312 million (previous year: €655 million). As in previ-
ous years, the majority of the €289 million investment in
property, plant and equipment (previous year: €270 million)
stemmed from Arvato. Investments in intangible assets came
to €411 million (previous year: €177 million) and were primar-
ily attributable to BMG for the acquisition of music catalogs
and to RTL Group for investments in film rights. The sum of
€108 million was invested in financial assets (previous year:
€120 million). Purchase prices for consolidated investments
(less acquired cash and cash equivalents) totaled €504 million
in the reporting period (previous year: €88 million) and were
primarily attributable to the takeovers of BMG and Gothia.
The negative investments of Penguin Random House in the
amount of €-36 million (previous year: €53 million) can be
attributed to cash and cash equivalents acquired as a result of
the merger of Penguin and Random House.

Consolidated Balance Sheet

Total assets increased significantly to €21.4 billion as of
December 31, 2013 (previous year: €18.9 billion). The in-
crease is mainly attributable to the reduction in shares in
RTL Group, the merger of Penguin and Random House as
well as the takeovers of BMG and Gothia. These portfolio
changes led to an increase in intangible assets and equity.
Cash and cash equivalents of €2.7 billion remained at the
previous year's high level (previous year: €2.7 billion). The
income from the reduction in shares in RTL Group increased
equity to €8.7 billion (previous year: €6.1 billion). As a result
of this increase, the equity ratio increased from 32.2 per-
cent in the previous year to 40.7 percent. Equity attributable
to Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA shareholders increased to
€6.9 billion (previous year: €5.3 billion). Provisions for pen-
sions and similar obligations decreased from €2,146 mil-
lion in the previous year to €1,944 million. Gross financial
debt decreased from €3,876 million to €3,381 million as of

December 31, 2013 due to the partial early repayments of
long-term debt reported in the section “Financing Activities.”
Apart from that, the balance sheet structure remained largely
unchanged from the previous year.

Profit Participation Capital

Profit participation capital had a nominal value of €301 mil-
lion as of December 31, 2013, which is unchanged from
the previous year. If the effective interest method is
applied, the carrying amount of profit participation capi-
tal was €413 million as of December 31, 2013 (previous
year: €413 million). The 2001 profit participation certificates
(ISIN DE0005229942) account for 94 percent of notional
profit participation capital, while the 1992 profit partici-
pation certificates (ISIN DE0005229900) account for the
remaining 6 percent.

The 2001 profit participation certificates are officially listed
for trading on the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange. Their price is listed as a percentage of nominal
value. The lowest closing rate of the 2001 profit partici-
pation certificates in financial year 2013 was 244.00 percent in
January; their highest was 284.00 percent in November.

Under the terms and conditions of the 2001 profit partici-
pation certificates, the payout for each full financial year
is 15 percent of notional value, subject to the availabil-
ity of sufficient Group profit as well as profit at the level of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. These conditions were met in
the past financial year. Accordingly, a payout of 15 percent of
the notional value of the 2001 profit participation certificates
will be made for financial year 2013.

The 1992 profit participation certificates, approved for trad-
ing on the Regulated Market in Frankfurt, only have a limited
cash trade due to their low volume. Payouts on the 1992 profit
participation certificates are based on the Group's return on
total assets. As the return on total assets for financial year 2013
was 6.49 percent (previous year: 6.39 percent), the payout on
the 1992 profit participation certificates for financial year 2013
will be 7.49 percent of their notional value (previous year:
7.39 percent).

The payout distribution date for both profit participation certifi-
cates is expected to be on May 12, 2014. Under the terms and
conditions of the profit participation certificates, the auditors
appointed by Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA are responsible for
verifying whether amounts to be distributed have been calcu-
lated correctly. The auditors of both profit participation certifi-
cates provide confirmation of this.

Performance of the Group Divisions
RTL Group

Although advertising markets across Europe were mostly in
decline, Europe’s leading entertainment group RTL Group was
able to significantly increase its profitability in financial year 2013.
Revenues reached €5.9 billion after €6.0 billion in the previous
year, representing a 1.9 percent decrease. This revenue develop-
ment reflects robust core businesses despite negative currency
effects and lower revenues for the production arm Fremantle
Media. In operating EBIT, another record result by Mediengruppe
RTL Deutschland and the strong performance of the Dutch TV
channels more than offset the impact of the negative develop-
ment of advertising markets in many parts of Europe. Only the
German TV advertising market showed slight growth.

Operating EBIT increased by 6.8 percent to a new record level
of €1.1 billion (previous year: €1.1 billion). This pushed the
return on sales to 19.3 percent (previous year: 17.7 percent).
Operating EBITDA increased slightly to €1.3 billion (previous
year: €1.3 billion). At year-end, RTL Group had 11,589 employ-
ees (December 31, 2012: 11,931). RTL Group succeeded in
defending most of its leading positions in the audience markets.
In France, the Netherlands, Hungary and Croatia, RTL Group's
families of channels grew their share of the TV ad sales market.

Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland increased both its revenues
and earnings. RTL Television's flagship broadcaster remains
the clear market leader in the main target group. The French
Groupe M6 achieved lower revenues, partly because of the
declining advertising market. Operating EBIT declined due
to start-up losses for the new digital channel 6ter. Audience
shares remained largely stable despite the market entry of new
competitors. RTL Nederland grew its revenues and operating
EBIT despite a shrinking advertising market, and scored higher
viewer ratings.

The production arm Fremantle Media registered continued
global interest in its major talent shows and invested in the
development of new formats. Revenues fell mainly due to cur-
rency effects and because of the cancellation of formats in
individual territories. Operating EBIT was slightly down year
on year. In November, Fremantle Media acquired the Danish
production company Miso Film, which specializes in series
and TV movies.

In the growth market of Asia, RTL Group partnered with CBS
Studios International to initiate the establishment of two new
channels. The first channel, RTL CBS Entertainment HD, made
its debut in 2013 in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and the
Philippines. The launch of the second channel will follow in
the spring of 2014. In Croatia, RTL Hrvatska established a new
children’s channel, which went on air in January 2014 and has
scored excellent ratings from the start.

76 Financial Information Group Management Report

RTL Group's digital business also continued to be greatly ex-
panded. The Group acquired a majority stake in BroadbandTV,
one of the largest multichannel networks on YouTube, and also
invested in the leading online video network for fashion and
beauty StyleHaul, the German YouTube network Divimove,
and the Dutch video-on-demand provider Videoload. The
Group's various online platforms and mobile applications
recorded high growth rates.

RTL Group has been additionally listed on the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange since the end of April 2013. Bertelsmann reduced
its holdings and has since held 75.1 percent of the shares in
the company.

Penguin Random House

For Random House, 2013 was the year of the historic merger
of all its divisions outside Germany with Pearson's trade pub-
lishing division Penguin Group. The formation of Penguin
Random House was completed on July 1, and the multiyear
integration of the two units is now underway. Bertelsmann
holds 53 percent of the shares in the world’s largest trade
book publisher, while Pearson holds 47 percent.

This year-end consolidated revenue of €2.7 billion for the com-
bined company reflects a full year of Random House, includ-
ing Germany's Verlagsgruppe Random House, and a half-year
of the Penguin Group. Total sales were 23.9 percent above
Random House's previous year's revenue (€2.1 billion). Adjusted
for currency and portfolio effects, revenues decreased com-
pared with the record year 2012, which was dominated by the
exceptional success of the “Fifty Shades” trilogy. Operating
EBIT fell 4.9 percent from the high level of the previous year —
partly due to depreciations in connection with the initial inclu-
sion of intangible assets at Penguin — to €309 million (previous
year: €325 million). Return on sales came to 11.6 percent
(previous year: 15.2 percent). Operating EBITDA increased
to €363 million (previous year: €352 million). At the end of
the year, Penguin Random House had 11,838 employees
(December 31, 2012, Random House: 5,712).

Penguin Random House’s biggest new release was Dan
Brown's “Inferno,” selling almost six million copies in its
English-language territories in seven months. Other mega-
sellers included Sheryl Sandberg’s “Lean In,” “And The
Mountains Echoed” by Khaled Hosseini, “The Fault In Our
Stars” by John Green and John Grisham's “Sycamore Row.”
Demand for English-, German- and Spanish-language editions of
the “Fifty Shades” trilogy continued to be strong with more than
seven million print, digital and audiobook copies sold in 2013.

The US company placed 261 titles on the “New York Times”
hardcover and paperback bestseller lists from July to Decem-
ber, 27 of them at number one. During the same period,
Penguin Random House UK placed 14 number one titles
on the bestseller lists of the “Sunday Times.” In Germany,
Verlagsgruppe Random House attained major growth in its
digital publishing business, achieving first-time double-digit
percentage of overall sales revenues with e-books. The divi-
sion’s biggest-selling title of the year was “Die Analphabetin,
die rechnen konnte” by Jonas Jonasson. A solid business per-
formance in Latin America and a strong portfolio of Spanish-
language bestsellers offset the impact of the difficult economy
in Spain, where the publishing unit has operated under the
name Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial since November.
In India and South Africa, Penguin Random House completed
the purchase of their respective co-partners’ ownership stakes.

With new apps, the increasing integration of social media
into book marketing and growing e-book downloads, Penguin
Random House has advanced its leadership in the transfor-
mation to digital. During the reporting period, the Group sold
more than 100 million e-books worldwide, and more than
77,000 titles are now internationally available in digital form.

Many Penguin Random House authors received prestigious
literary awards in 2013, including Alice Munro, the winner of
the Nobel Prize in Literature. The Group’s authors also won
four Pulitzer Prizes, a National Book Award in the United
States, and for Verlagsgruppe Random House, the German
Book Prize.

Gruner + Jahr

At Gruner + Jahr, the financial year was shaped by a person-
nel, organizational and strategic realignment to transform the
existing printing and publishing company into a “house of
content” with high-quality print and digital offerings for spe-
cific target groups. On the commercial side, Gruner + Jahr
reported a significant fall in revenues and operating result
during the reporting period; this was against a backdrop of
declining ad sales revenues, the partial discontinuation of its
business media along with other disposals, increased invest-
ment in the digital business and a decline in the international
business. Revenues reached €2.1 billion after €2.2 billion
the previous year (-6.9 percent). Operating EBIT was down
by 13.1 percent to €146 million (previous year: €168 million).
Return on sales decreased to 7.1 percent (previous year:
7.6 percent). Operating EBITDA was €193 million against
€213 million in the previous year. At year-end, Gruner + Jahr
employed 10,819 people (December 31, 2012: 11,585). Since
April 2013, Gruner + Jahr has been jointly managed by Julia
Jakel (CEO), Stephan Schafer and Oliver Radtke.

G+J Germany managed to improve its result year on year.
Sales revenues dipped in line with market conditions but
adjusted for portfolio changes the advertising business
developed positively, bucking the market trend. In Germany
the business structures were fundamentally changed. With
its realignment along eight Communities of Interest, G+J
is resolutely focusing on the interests of its readers, users
and customers. For instance, its strong position in the
Living, Food and Family communities was expanded with
investments in digital offers such as the Home and Furniture
community Roomido, the online store for high-end foods
Delinero and the online store for baby and children’s cloth-
ing Tausendkind. “Chefkoch” and “Flow” enhanced the print
portfolio of the Food and Women communities with two
innovative new titles. G+J Media Sales added market share
in the ad sales market, and both G+J’s digital marketer EMS
and the performance marketer Ligatus recorded continued
dynamic growth.

Prisma Media's magazine business in France declined due to
difficult market conditions. The expansion of the digital busi-
ness was successfully advanced, including through targeted
acquisitions. For instance, the reporting period saw the
acquisition of the two digital ad sales houses Mob Value and
P Comme Performance.

Verlagsgruppe News in Austria declined, underperforming the
market mainly in the ad sales business. In the reporting year,
its activities in Southern Europe continued to be affected by
difficult macroeconomic conditions. The company sold off
its operations in Poland and parts of the operations in South-
eastern Europe.

78 Financial Information Group Management Report

Gruner + Jahr’s activities in China reported declines due to
a first-time reduction in the Chinese ad sales market. In the
United States, the offset printing company Brown Printing
saw a fall in revenues and earnings due to lower utilization.
The business of Dresdner Druck- und Verlagshaus was mostly
stable.

During the reporting period, G+J journalists and authors won
a variety of prestigious awards for their work; in Germany
alone, they won more than any other publisher.

Arvato

The international service provider Arvato delivered a robust busi-
ness performance in financial year 2013. Revenues remained
stable at €4.4 billion (previous year: €4.4 billion). Operating EBIT
remained stable at €244 million (previous year: €244 million).
Return on sales thus remained at 5.5 percent (previous year:
5.5 percent). Operating EBITDA increased to €401 million
(previous year: €391 million). There was a management
changeover at the top of Arvato: Achim Berg has led the group
as Chief Executive Officer since April 2013. A new organiza-
tional structure arranges the businesses by Solution Groups
and countries, and a central Key Account Management sys-
tem was introduced for major international clients. At year-end,
Arvato employed 66,410 people (December 31, 2012: 63,627).

During the reporting period Arvato registered significant
growth mainly at IT Services and supply chain management
solutions for international customers in the Internet, high-tech
and consumer goods sectors, as well as in China. Arvato’s
acquisition of Gothia Financial Group, completed in June
2013, advanced its internationalization and turned it into the
third-largest service provider in Europe in the rapidly growing
market for business information and financial services.

Operating EBIT also reflects upfront costs for acquisitions and
set-up costs for newly acquired customers in the supply chain
management and e-commerce businesses.

In the reporting period, the customer relationship manage-
ment business showed a positive development in Germany
and Spain, and declined slightly in France. In South America,
Asia and Africa, new offshore sites for customer communi-
cations solutions were established or expanded to increase
competitiveness.

Arvato’s Print Services asserted its position in a difficult
market environment. Revenues in Replication declined as
expected. In Brazil and China, Arvato sold holdings in replica-
tion factories.

The development of Arvato’s businesses varied from region
to region. For example, performance was satisfactory in the
European core countries given the difficult economic situa-
tion. In the UK, a major new government services client, the
Department for Transport, was acquired. The service activities
in Spain saw profitable growth despite the economic crisis.
Meanwhile, the services businesses in France were not quite
able to maintain the previous year's high levels. In the North
American market, the portfolio of customers and locations
was systematically culled to increase the profitability of the
businesses. In Turkey, Arvato’s services businesses grew
dynamically, and in China the company’s logistics network
was expanded considerably yet again.

Arvato won prestigious awards in various countries around
the world for its tailored customer solutions.

Be Printers

In 2013, Bertelsmann’s gravure and international offset print-
ing activities, grouped into Be Printers, generated revenues of
€1.1 billion in a difficult market environment, down 7.5 percent
from the previous year (€1.2 billion). Operating EBIT declined
by 29.3 percent to €41 million (previous year: €58 million),
and return on sales thus amounted to 3.7 percent (previous
year: 4.8 percent). Operating EBITDA decreased to €92 million
(previous year: €115 million). At year-end, Be Printers em-
ployed 6,201 people (December 31, 2012: 6,571).

Declining print runs characterized Be Printers’ printing opera-
tions in the reporting period, as did continuing price pressure
and high excess capacity in the industry. The group responded
with new offers as well as various programs to increase effi-
ciency and lower costs.

Specifically, the gravure division Prinovis realized savings
in personnel costs and materials purchasing. Provisions for
restructuring costs were formed for the planned closure of
the Itzehoe site in April 2014. As a special item, these are
not shown under operating EBIT. The fire at a gravure print-
ing press in Dresden led to restrictions on production; at the
same time, Prinovis received a compensation payment from
the machine's property insurance. As a special item, this is not
shown under operating EBIT. In the UK, a major customer cut
order volumes. Overall, revenues and earnings were down at
Prinovis. During the reporting period, several of Prinovis’ print
products and digital offers won industry awards for their high
quality.

Be Printers’ Southern European printing companies did busi-
ness in a difficult market environment that was further exac-
erbated by macroeconomic developments in Italy and Spain.
The units recorded declining volumes. Management coun-
tered this with measures to increase sales and cut costs, for
example, in the areas of procurement and IT. The merger of
the Italian and German calendar businesses also improved
productivity and competitiveness.

Be Printers Americas bucked the declining market develop-
ment and kept its earnings stable. Growing business with
clients outside the publishing industry — such as communi-
cations services for companies in the health-care sector —
cushioned the decline in revenues. In 2013, major existing
customers renewed their contracts with Be Printers Americas.

Corporate Investments/Corporate Center

In 2013, Corporate Investments, which includes all of
Bertelsmann’s other operating activities, recorded signifi-
cantly increased revenue of €582 million (previous year:
€471 million) and operating EBIT of €-40 million (previous
year: €-38 million). Operating EBITDA was €10 million com-
pared with €-29 million in the previous year. The acquisition
of full ownership of the BMG Music Rights subsidiary, com-
pleted in April 2013, helped to boost revenues. This was partly
offset by declining revenues in the Club and Direct Marketing
businesses. Operating EBIT reflects start-up losses, among
other things for business expansion in the education sector,
and a decline in earnings in the Club business. At year-end,
Corporate Investments had 4,342 employees (December 31,
2012: 4,289).

Jointly established by Bertelsmann and KKR, the music
rights company BMG has once again been fully owned by
Bertelsmann since the end of March 2013 and grew strongly
during the reporting period. BMG acquired several catalogs
of song and master rights: Primary Wave, Sanctuary, Mute
and Virgin/Famous. Numerous national and international
artists signed new contracts including Mick Jagger and
Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, Robbie Williams and
the Backstreet Boys. BMG expanded its presence in all major
music markets, including opening a branch in Canada.

In the reporting period, Bertelsmann invested in developing
its new line of business: education. The University Ventures
Fund, jointly established with other investors, expanded its
international portfolio of holdings. Bertelsmann also made
direct investments to increase its stake in Synergis Education,
a service provider that supports academic institutions in
establishing accredited online degree programs, and in the
innovative US online education provider University Now.

The Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments (BDMI) and
Bertelsmann Asia Investments (BAI) funds expanded their
portfolios. For instance, BDMI joined RTL Group in investing
in the online video network StyleHaul, which brought its hold-
ings to a total of 49 at year-end. BAI acquired five new hold-
ings — including providers of mobile payment services, car
purchasing and cloud computing — and divested from three
companies, realizing high capital gains in the process. The
remaining portfolio, consisting of 20 holdings, developed very
well. In India, two direct investments were made, including in
the real estate portal indiaproperty.com. In Brazil, investments
were also made in two online media start-ups.

Revenues in the Club business declined as planned in 2013.
The operational business of the direct marketing company
Inmediaone will be gradually phased out by mid-2014. The
dismantling of the German Club continued with store closures,

and the businesses in the Czech Republic and Slovakia were
sold to a strategic investor.

The Corporate Center department, which comprises all of the
Group's Corporate Centers around the world, controlled and
supported several large transactions in 2013, including the
merger of Penguin and Random House into the world’s lead-
ing trade book publishing group and the incremental place-
ment of RTL Group shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Its work during the year also focused on the organization
of a Management Meeting and “State of the Art Forum” in
Silicon Valley, as well as the global employee survey. In the
first half of 2013 the Bertelsmann Executive Board launched
the operational excellence program, which is designed to
monitor processes and structures in the financial, HR, IT and
procurement departments across the Group. The program will
support Group strategy by modernizing structures, improving
efficiency and creating uniform standards of quality. It will
be implemented in several stages over a period of up to five
years.

General Statement by the Company
Management on the Economic Situation

2013 was a successful financial year for Bertelsmann, in
which progress was made in all strategic priorities. Of the
existing businesses, the German television business in par-
ticular achieved solid growth. Despite the uneven develop-
ment of the European advertising markets and the structurally
declining businesses, Bertelsmann was able to fulfill its rev-
enue and earnings expectations. In 2013, Bertelsmann gen-
erated consolidated revenues of €16.4 billion, an increase of
1.8 percent. On an organic basis, adjusted for currency and
portfolio effects, consolidated revenues fell by 2.8 percent.
The organic revenue decline is attributable to the weak Euro-
pean advertising markets overall, the extraordinarily strong
previous year at Random House, the impact of structur-
ally declining businesses and deliberately managed revenue
development at Arvato. Taking into account the normalized
book publishing business, revenue development was in line
with expectations (outlook in Annual Report 2012: stable or
slightly declining). Operating EBIT of €1,754 million (previous
year: €1,732 million) was slightly above the previous year (out-
look in Annual Report 2012: moderately below the previous
year’s figure). Operating EBIT includes investments in digitiza-
tion projects and start-up losses for new businesses. Return
on sales achieved a solid level of earnings at 10.7 percent (out-
look in Annual Report 2012: at least 10 percent).

In 2013, the successful implementation of strategic measures
paved the way for Bertelsmann to become a faster-growing,
more digital and more international Group. Strengthening the
core businesses in the reporting period resulted in the expan-
sion of the families of channels at RTL Group, the merger
of Penguin and Random House and the new organizational
structures at Gruner + Jahr and Arvato. At the same time the
structurally declining businesses were scaled back. This is
shown in the initiated closure of the gravure printing location
at Itzehoe, the disposal of the replication business in Brazil
as well as the announcement that the activities of the direct
marketing company Inmediaone will be terminated. The digi-
tal transformation was driven forward through the expansion
of the nonlinear TV offerings at RTL Group, the increase in
e-book revenues at Penguin Random House and the specific
alignment of Gruner + Jahr Germany according to defined
Communities of Interest. The growth platforms were devel-
oped in particular through the acquisition of the financial ser-
vice provider Gothia, the full takeover of BMG and additional
investments in University Ventures. The presence in growth
regions was strengthened in particular by RTL Group's partici-
pation in RTL CBS Asia Entertainment Network in Southeast
Asia, the growth of Arvato China and through Bertelsmann
Asia Investments.

82 Financial Information Group Management Report

Bertelsmann’s net assets and financial position remain posi-
tive. The financial strength was improved as a result of the
proceeds generated from the reduction in the RTL share-
holding in the reporting period. In view of the cash and cash
equivalents available as of December 31, 2013, of €2.7 billion,
the liquidity situation is good. The ratings agencies Moody's
and S&P rated Bertelsmann as “Baa1” and “BBB+” respec-
tively and with a stable outlook. Taking into account the solid
liquidity and financing base as well as the positive business
performance, Bertelsmann considers that the Group's overall
financial situation is positive and thus provides a suitable start-
ing basis for further implementation of the strategic growth
targets.

Significant Events After the Balance Sheet Date

In January 2014, Arvato took over significant parts of Netrada
Group and combined the e-commerce businesses of both
companies. As a result of the merger, Arvato has become
one of the leading European service providers for integrated
e-commerce services and at the same time benefits from
Netrada’s strong position in the growing fashion and lifestyle
market segment. The range of services includes the develop-
ment and operation of web shops, financial services, transport
and logistics as well as customer service.

In February 2014, BMG acquired a 100-percent interest in the
Dutch music publishing company Talpa Music B.V. The music
company currently owns over 37,000 songs including many
electronic dance music titles. The company also represents
the publishing interests of various dance labels.

The bond due in January 2014 and the promissory note due in
February 2014 were repaid when these matured. Part of cash
and cash equivalents was used in this regard.

Non-Financial Performance Indicators
Employees

At the end of the financial year, the Group had 111,763
employees worldwide (previous year: 104,286). The increase
of 7,477 employees is attributable primarily to strategic port-
folio expansions. In 2013, there were 1,304 people (previous
year: 1,254) serving in trainee positions in Bertelsmann com-
panies in Germany.


--- Page 22 ---

Implementing and developing the partnership-based corpo-
rate culture is one of the top priorities of human resources
(HR). For this reason, in 2013 the HR strategy initiatives that
were agreed in the previous year were driven forward. For
example, the new executive remuneration structure was intro-
duced on other levels. The system that had previously been
dominated by financial objectives was extended to include
other objective criteria, including a number of qualitative cri-
teria. Thus, among other things, the quality of management
performance is included as a criterion for determining variable
remuneration.

The focus of HR work in 2013 was the global employee survey.
Once again, the survey achieved a record level of participation
at 86.9 percent. The results were broken down to the depart-
mental level and compiled into approximately 10,000 result
reports and were made available to executives. This ensures
that the results are worked on not only at divisional and Group
level but also at team and company level.

Bertelsmann aims to promote diversity at all levels of the com-
pany. The diversity conference, which took place for the first
time in February 2013, provided a forum for discussions about
the level of diversity within the Group. Together with interna-
tional executives from the Group, the conference developed
and discussed key work aspects and measures to strengthen
diversity.

In order to promote internationality and diversity within the
Group, the annual careers event “Talent Meets Bertelsmann”
was given an international focus. Over 450 people applied,
and 63 of these were invited to Berlin for three days to
exchange ideas with 80 company representatives, to receive
professional career coaching and to present the results of
their workshop to members of the Executive Board and the
GMC. Since 2012, two women have been on the Executive
Board of Bertelsmann Management SE, and the GMC has
15 members from seven countries — including six women.

In August 2013, “peoplenet” was introduced to make it easier
for employees to access further training measures worldwide.
Employees can use this online platform to find comprehensive
information about all relevant training and further education
programs and can apply for these directly on the system. At
the end of 2013, “peoplenet” was initially made available to
around 30,000 employees in Germany, and it will be extended
to other locations in 2014. In parallel, Bertelsmann University
and Bertelsmann Academy are continuously working on the
development of their courses in line with the new Group strat-
egy. For example, Bertelsmann University is largely respon-
sible for designing and implementing the Digital Excellence
Initiative in cooperation with Corporate Development.

Corporate Responsibility

Taking responsibility — for employees, for the quality of
media and services and for the impact the corporate activi-
ties have on society and the environment — is a key compo-
nent of Bertelsmann’s corporate culture. For decades, the
Bertelsmann Essentials have specified corporate responsibil-
ity as one of their main goals and as a basic value for all of the
company’s employees, executives and shareholders.

Since 1974, Bertelsmann has regularly published an account
of its commitment and activities in addition to the financial
performance targets. To satisfy the growing demands of its
stakeholders in relation to social and ecological topics, the
Group publishes relevant information and facts and figures
about corporate responsibility and compliance on its web-
site. Since 2008, Bertelsmann has been a member of the UN
Global Compact and, as part of the annual progress reporting,
provides information about the measures that have already
been realized and those that are planned. In accordance with
the partnership-based principle of delegating responsibility,
specific corporate responsibility projects are implemented in a
decentralized way in the individual divisions. Key action areas
are employee responsibility, promoting reading and media
literacy, aid and donation campaigns through the media,
responsibility for content, and environmental and climate pro-
tection.

Bertelsmann’s “be green” environmental initiative promotes
corporate responsibility in the areas of environment and
climate protection. With the support of the independent
ecological research institute IFEU, Bertelsmann produces a
regular carbon footprint report in accordance with the globally
recognized stipulations of the GHG protocol. This report was
drawn up again in 2013 and audited by the auditing firm PwC.
The carbon footprint report is an important component of the
further development of the corporate responsibility strategy
with the aim of ensuring that Bertelsmann as a company
will use resources in a more eco-friendly and efficient way in
order to remain competitive over the long term. On June 5,
2013, UN World Environment Day, the global “be green Day”
was held for the fourth time across the Group. Employees at
around 40 locations in 13 countries took part.

Innovations

Businesses traditionally invest in the research and develop-
ment of new products in order to ensure their long-term
competitiveness. The media sector has a similar imperative
to create innovative media content and media-related prod-
ucts and services in a rapidly changing environment. This
means that rather than traditional research and development

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2013 83


--- Page 23 ---

activities, for Bertelsmann, its unique power of innovation is
important. Long-term success of the Group depends heavily
on using flexible business models, investing in growth mar-
kets and integrating new technologies. Innovative expertise is
also a key driver of Bertelsmann’s organic growth.

Bertelsmann relies on innovation and growth in core opera-
tions and new business fields. The key factors of Bertelsmann’s
innovation management include continuously following
cross-industry trends and observing new markets. At a Group
level, Bertelsmann works with the divisions to continuously
identify and implement innovative business strategies. Along-
side the market-oriented activities, support is given to Group-
wide initiatives that actively promote knowledge transfer and
collaboration. At regular innovation forums, executives meet
with internal and external experts to examine relevant tech-
nological, economic and social trends and develop recom-
mendations for action for their own businesses. This form
of collaboration, network building and organized collective
knowledge transfer is essential to Bertelsmann in order to
turn business ideas and innovations into business reality. This
close link between centralized and decentralized elements of
innovation management allows Bertelsmann to play an active
role in shaping the rapidly transforming media business and
ensuring long-term success.

RTL Group's innovation management is focused on three core
topics: developing and acquiring new, high-quality TV formats;
using all digital distribution means; and expanding various
forms of marketing and monetization. Further developing
nonlinear and mobile TV services is particularly important.
Besides the popular ad-financed catch-up TV services such
as RTL Now in Germany and 6Play in France, the RTL Group
channels are also working to establish pay models in the on-
demand business. For example, RTL Nederland acquired the

ajority share of the leading Pay-Video-On-Demand service in
the Netherlands in June 2013. Furthermore, in spring 2014, in
conjunction with SBS and the Dutch public broadcasting ser-
vice, RTL Nederland will launch the platform NL Ziet, where
users can stream content from the three families of chan-
nels via a single contact point. RTL Group is also working
on securing a leading position on the video portal YouTube.
Here, the production subsidiary Fremantle Media and the
recently acquired majority stake in the multichannel network
BroadbandTV play a key role. Mediengruppe RTL Deutsch-
land is expanding its digital distribution through new agree-
ments governing the broadcasting of linear TV channels
via the online platforms Zattoo and Magine. The continued
development of online video advertising sales on all screen
and TV platforms is one of the key digital growth segments
for RTL Group. RTL Group offers advertisers a large number
of new interactive forms of advertising parallel to linear TV

84 Financial Information Group Management Report

use, for example, via M6 Connect or the dynamic integration
of advertising spots in closed TV services such as RTL Now
and Vox Now on “Select Video” from Kabel Deutschland.
Synergy Committees act as an organizational platform for
exchanging information and knowledge in the decentralized
RTL Group. These are made up of executives and experts from
the RTL Group's operating units and Corporate Center and
hold meetings several times a year.

The newly merged Penguin Random House brings together
and leverages the previously individual Penguin and Random
House innovative initiatives for the entire publishing pro-
cess on a global scale. Penguin Random House is constantly
exploring new ways to discover and nurture authors’ voices,
enhance the power of their writing, and spread their mes-
sages everywhere with traditional and developing content
platforms. As a leading content provider, the publisher offers
more than 77,000 e-books worldwide, and an increasing, wide
array of award-winning apps and format start-up partnerships.
Penguin Random House is rapidly expanding its social media
reach to intensify relationships with readers and its publisher
and author brands. Through its growing investments in virtual
information and service platforms, Penguin Random House
will continue to present its authors with tools and tutorials to
enhance their connectivity and discoverability.

Gruner + Jahr is expanding its publishing business along all
media-based platforms and value chains. This includes the
qualitative development of the existing portfolio, the launch
of new titles, the digital transformation of journalistic content
into new digital channels and the development and expan-
sion of complementary services offered in the Communities of
Interest prioritized by Gruner + Jahr. In advertising marketing,
the focus was on gaining additional market shares, expand-
ing cross-media marketing, the international roll-out of perfor-
mance marketing and expanding the mobile unit.

Arvato is aiming to become the best business partner for its
customers by being innovative, agile, flexible and international.
In order to increase its innovative power, Arvato adapted its
internal structures in 2013 and, in the future, will be organized
according to seven Solution Groups (CRM, SCM, Financial
Solutions, IT Solutions, Digital Marketing, Print Solutions and
Replication). These competence areas will be responsible for
the global development of Arvato in the respective business
segments. Their primary aim is to develop and market innova-
tive, integrated solutions. Arvato is also increasing its innova-
tive power by investing in new technologies and by taking
over companies in fast-growing service segments. In 2013,
for example, it acquired the international Gothia Financial
Group, which has an innovative service portfolio particularly
in the growing e-commerce services market.

Be Printers is developing and investing in print-related solu-
tions and products for its customers in order to generate new
business and strengthen the business relationship through
additional offers. In 2013, innovations in the digital solutions
sector and in the non-book business were developed fur-
ther. These primarily consist of the POS Marketing Terminal
(customer terminal for retailers) and print-based communi-
cation campaigns in traditional direct marketing. In addition,
Be Printers is continuously working on concepts for the fur-
ther development of print products, looking above all at the
interaction with digital media.

Risks and Opportunities

Risk Management System

The purpose of the Bertelsmann risk management system
(RMS) is the early identification and evaluation of as well as
response to internal and external risks. The internal control
system (ICS), an integral component of the RMS, controls
and monitors the risks that have been identified. The aim
of the RMS is to identify, at an early stage, material risks to
the Group so that countermeasures can be taken and con-
trols implemented. Risks are possible future developments or
events that could result in a negative deviation from outlook
or objective for Bertelsmann. In addition, risks can negatively
affect the achievement of the Group’s strategic, operational,
reporting-related and compliance-related objectives.

The risk management process is based on the international
accepted frameworks of the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO Enter-
prise Risk Management — Integrated Framework and Internal
Control — Integrated Framework, respectively) and is organized
in sub-processes of identification, assessment, management,
control and monitoring. A major element of risk identification
is the risk inventory that lists significant risks year by year, from
the profit center level upward, and then aggregates them step
by step at the division and Group levels. This ensures that risks
are registered where their impact would be felt. There is also
a Group-wide reassessment of critical risks every six months
and quarterly reporting even if no risk event occurs. Ad hoc
reporting requirements ensure that significant changes in
the risk situation during the course of the year are brought to
the attention of the Executive Board. The risks are compared
against risk response and control measures to determine the
so-called net risk. Both one-year and three-year risk assess-
ment horizons are applied to enable the timely implementa-
tion of risk management measures. The basis for determining
the main Group risks is the three-year period, similar to the
medium-term corporate planning. The risk, measured against

possible financial loss, is the product of the estimated nega-
tive impact on the free cash flow should the risk occur and
the estimated probability of occurrence. Risk monitoring is
conducted by Group management on an ongoing basis. The
RMS, along with its component ICS, is constantly undergoing
further development and is integrated into ongoing reporting
to the Bertelsmann Executive Board and Supervisory Board.
Corporate risk management committees and divisional risk
meetings are convened at regular intervals to ensure compli-
ance with statutory and internal requirements.

Under section 91 (2) of Germany's Stock Corporation Act
(AktG), the auditors inspect the risk early warning system
for its capacity to identify developments early on that could
threaten the existence of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA, then
report their findings to the Supervisory Board. Corporate Audit
conducts ongoing reviews of the adequacy and functional
capability of the RMS in the divisions of Penguin Random
House, Arvato and Be Printers as well as the Corporate
Investments and Corporate Center segments. The risk manage-
ment systems of RTL Group and Gruner + Jahr are evalu-
ated by the respective internal auditing departments of those
divisions and by external auditors. Any issues that are iden-
tified are promptly remedied through appropriate measures.
The Bertelsmann Executive Board defined the scope and
focus of the RMS based on the specific circumstances of the
company. However, even an appropriately designed and func-
tional RMS cannot guarantee with absolute certainty that risks
will be identified and controlled.

Accounting-Related Risk Management System
and Internal Control System

The objectives of the accounting-related RMS and the ICS are
to ensure that external and internal accounting is proper and
reliable in accordance with applicable laws and that informa-
tion is made available without delay. Reporting should also
present a true and fair view of Bertelsmann’s net assets, finan-
cial position and results of operation. The following statements
pertain to the consolidated financial statements (including the
“Notes” and “Management Report” sections), interim report-
ing and internal management reporting.

The ICS for the accounting process consists of the following
areas. The Group’s internal rules for accounting and the prepa-
ration of financial statements (e.g., IFRS manual, guidelines,
circulars) are made available without delay to all employees
involved in the accounting process. The consolidated financial
statements are prepared in a reporting system that is uniform
throughout the Group. Extensive automatic system controls
ensure the consistency of the data in the financial statements.
The system is subject to ongoing development through a
documented change process. Systematized processes for
coordinating intercompany transactions serve to prepare
the corresponding consolidation steps. Circumstances that
could lead to significant misinformation in the consolidated
financial statements are monitored centrally by employees of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and by RTL Group (for the pre-
consolidated subgroup), then verified by external experts as
required. Central contacts from Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
and the divisions are also in continuous contact with the local
subsidiaries to ensure IFRS-compliant accounting as well as
compliance with reporting deadlines and obligations. These
preventive measures are supplemented by specific controls
in the form of analyses by the Corporate Financial Reporting
department of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and RTL Group
(for the preconsolidated subgroup). The purpose of such
analyses is to identify any remaining inconsistencies. The
Group- and division-level controlling departments are also
integrated into the internal management reporting. Internal
and external reporting are reconciled during the quarterly
segment reconciliation process. The further aim in introduc-
ing a globally binding control framework for the decentralized
accounting processes is to achieve a standardized ICS format
at the level of the local accounting departments of all fully
consolidated Group companies. The findings of the external
auditors and Corporate Audit are promptly discussed with the
affected companies, and solutions are developed. An annual
self-assessment is conducted to establish a reporting of the
quality of the ICS in the key Group companies. The findings
are discussed in Audit and Finance Committee meetings at
the divisional level.

86 Financial Information Group Management Report

Corporate Audit and the internal auditing departments of
RTL Group and Gruner + Jahr evaluate the accounting-
related processes as part of their auditing work. As part of
the auditing process, the Group auditor also reports to the
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA Supervisory Board Audit and
Finance Committee about any significant vulnerabilities of the
accounting-related ICS that were identified during the audit
and the findings regarding the risk early warning system.

Major Risks to the Group

Bertelsmann is exposed to a variety of risks. The major risks
to Bertelsmann identified in the risk reporting are listed in
order of priority in the table below. In line with the level of
possible financial loss, the risks are classified as endanger-
ing, considerable, significant, moderate or low for the pur-
poses of risk tolerability. The risk inventory carried out did
not identify any risks that would be classified as considerable
or endangering.

Given the diversity of the core business fields in which
Bertelsmann is active and the corresponding diversity of risks
to which the various divisions are exposed, the key strategic
and operational risks to the Group identified below are broken
down by business segment. Integration risks from acquisitions
carried out and information technology risks were identified
as the primary risks and are therefore described separately.
This is followed by an outline of legal and regulatory risks and
financial market risks. These risks are largely managed at the
corporate level.

Strategic and Operational Risks

The development of the global economy in 2013 reflected
the moderate growth level of the previous year. In 2014, the
subdued global growth dynamic of recent years is expected
to accelerate slightly. Although uncertainty over economic
developments has eased somewhat, Bertelsmann’s business
development is still dogged by certain risks. Assuming the
continuing normalization of the overall economic situation,
Bertelsmann expects stable development of Group revenues
for 2014. In addition to the risk from economic development,
other significant Group risks include customer risks, the risks
from changes in the market environment, supplier relationship
risks and pricing and margin risks. How these risks develop
depends, among other things, to a large extent on changes
in customer behavior due to factors such as the digitization of
media, the development and implementation of products and
services by current and future competitors, bad debt losses as

I Existing risks

well as default and interference along the production chains
in individual sectors such as IT. Employee-related risks, the
integration risks associated with the Penguin Random House
merger and the audience and market share are moderate risks
for Bertelsmann.

The most important risks for RTL Group are a decrease in
audience and advertising market shares as well as risks arising
from changes in market environment and economic down-
turns. A decrease in audience shares could lead to decreasing
revenues. RTL Group actively monitors international market
changes and program trends. This is increasingly the case
in the digital world, where audiences generally have more
choice and market entry barriers are reduced. Higher com-
petition in program acquisition, ongoing audience fragmen-
tation and expansion of platform operators may also impact
RTL Group's ability to generate revenues. Furthermore, eco-
nomic development directly impacts the advertising market
and therefore RTL Group revenue. With a focus on developing
non-advertising revenue streams this risk is countered. Apart
from potential cost increases triggered by content suppli-
ers, the business can be impacted by the risk of losing key
suppliers of content and customers. To address these risks,
long-term contracts with major content providers are closed,
and active customer relationship management is established.
RTL Group's strategy is also to further diversify its business by
establishing complementary families of channels and utilizing
the opportunities presented by digitization.

The principle risk for Penguin Random House arises from the
merger of the two companies. As with any merger of this size,
the process of integrating the two companies, and in particular

the process of integrating the companies’ IT systems, creates
significant risks. Management has established work streams
to carry out the integration plan and is closely monitoring
its progress. Otherwise, the creation of the larger company
has increased the scale of, but has not significantly altered
the nature of, the risks that Random House faced prior to the
merger. The increase in the digital portion of the business
presents opportunities, but also creates challenges related to
pricing and customer margin. The overall market trend, espe-
cially toward declining physical sales in book stores, could
threaten the long-trend viability of certain customers and will
likely result in continued margin pressure. Also, higher paper
prices and general economic uncertainty continue to pose
risks. The risk minimization strategy includes credit insurance
to limit bad debt risks, long-term contracts with suppliers and
a flexible cost structure in response to economic downturns.
The continuing decline in store space of physical book retail-
ers will be partially mitigated by e-book and online sales of
physical books and further measures to improve the competi-
tive situation.

The risks from a changing market environment constitute
the greatest risk position for Gruner + Jahr. There is also the
particular risk that higher agency discounts in the German
advertising markets and the growing significance of digital
advertising will lead to falling margins. The aim is to reduce
risks through active customer management, including new
forms of offers. The risk of a deterioration of the overall market
environment and resulting falls in advertising and circulation
revenues remains. Countermeasures include cost savings and
reviewing individual titles. On the supplier side, there is still a
risk of increasing commissions being charged by individual

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2013 87


--- Page 27 ---

distributors. Furthermore, there is the risk of losing key cus-
tomers, for example as advertising customers could switch
to other media, coupled with the risk associated with upcom-
ing tenders in the client business. These are to be addressed
through targeted measures for key account customers as well
as marketing measures. Advertising restrictions discussed
at the EU level (e.g., car advertising) could lead to declining
advertising revenues.

Arvato sees itself particularly exposed to risks from customer
relationships, risks from a changing market environment
as well as risks from supplier relationships. The reorganiza-
tion in the form of a matrix and a clear division into Solution
Groups while simultaneously taking into account the regional
dimension will make it possible to target customers more
effectively and help to reduce these risks. The potential loss
of key customers is being counteracted through active key
account management, long-term contracts with flexible cost
structures and through integrated service elements. Offer-
ing key customers a successful bundle of services reduces
the risk of losing an entire service relationship. The markets
in which Arvato operates and that are characterized by over-
capacity (primarily replication) show sustained price pressure.
In other areas, competitors are following Arvato’s strategy by
expanding their value chains, which is increasing the level
of competition. New competitors entering the market could
intensify the competitive pressure and lead to lower margins.
By constantly developing the range of services, the aim is to
improve the competitive position and increase customer loy-
alty through integrated solutions together with a trend toward
higher value added. A worsening of the economic environ-
ment could result in declining revenues and thus lower mar-
gins, which would necessitate cost-cutting measures and
capacity downsizing. The broad diversification across cus-
tomers, sectors and regions helps to reduce this risk. On the
procurement side is the risk that the procured intermediate
products could be of inferior quality, leading to corresponding
subsequent costs. Increased procurement prices that cannot
be passed on to customers constitute further risks. Counter-
measures include agreeing long-term contracts and monitor-
ing the supplier market. The ongoing trend toward digitization
entails further risks for individual customer segments of
Arvato, particularly in the manufacturing and distribution of
physical media products. These risks are being addressed,
for example, by developing business priorities, which com-
prise digital services. Furthermore, business segments that
offer no strategic or economic prospects are being deliber-
ately scaled back. The handling of IT risks with sector-specific
requirements (data protection and data security requirements)
is an additional risk for Arvato as an international service pro-
vider. This risk is being reduced by introducing an Information

88 Financial Information Group Management Report

Security Management System based on the ISO 27001 stan-
dard, which is used to systematically identify and resolve
information security risks.

Customer risks, in particular the greater dependence on a
few major customers in structural terms, are the most signifi-
cant risks for Be Printers. There are also risks from the mar-
ket environment, which is characterized by shrinking markets
and overcapacity. Risks can arise from a continuing market
concentration leading to tougher price competition and lower
margins. Deterioration in the economic environment may
lead to declining circulations with a negative impact on earn-
ings. The same applies to the increasing spread of digital end
devices, which is resulting in a decline in printed media. There
are further risks on the supplier side associated with rising raw
material prices — particularly for paper — that cannot be passed
on to customers. The risk minimization strategy is based,
among other things, on flexible contractual arrangements,
particularly for key accounts. Other key elements of this strat-
egy include the agreement of price-adjustment clauses, opti-
mizing cost structures and making them more flexible as well
as ongoing market monitoring.

Corporate Investments essentially comprises the fund invest-
ments and BMG as well as the Group's remaining Club and
Direct Marketing activities. From a Group perspective, the
identified risks are of minor importance.

Finally, it should be noted that because of demographic
change a greater emphasis in the risk reporting is placed on
employee-related risks such as a shift in the age distribution
of the workforce, challenges in recruiting qualified personnel
and the departure of top executives. This risk applies to all
divisions. Countermeasures include further training measures
and health programs, increased recruiting measures as well
as interdivisional talent development.

Integration Risks from Acquisitions Carried Out

As well as organic growth, the Group’s development strategy
includes targeted acquisitions of promising businesses. These
types of acquisitions, such as in 2013 the merger of Penguin
Random House, the takeover of the remaining shares in BMG
and the acquisition of Gothia, present opportunities as well
as risks. Integration into the Group requires one-time costs
that are usually offset by increased benefits in the long term
thanks to synergy effects. In this context, there are risks in
that the integration costs may be higher than expected or the
predicted level of synergies may not materialize. The integra-
tion processes are therefore being permanently monitored by
management.


--- Page 28 ---

Information Technology Risks

For a global media company like Bertelsmann, the reliability
and security of information technology is crucial. This means
that the Group is now facing a wide range of IT risks. Chal-
lenges are constantly increasing as the business environ-
ment becomes more and more complex due to the increasing
networking and IT penetration of business processes, many
internal processes that are not yet standardized and poten-
tial external risks. In the future, this issue will be actively
addressed by the introduction of the Group-wide Information
Security Management System. The implementation of the
management system includes regular and structured monitor-
ing of compliance with the regulations as well as systematic
recording of information security risks and deriving appropri-
ate measures.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

Bertelsmann, with its worldwide operations, is always
exposed to a variety of legal and regulatory risks ranging from
litigation to varying interpretations of tax assessment criteria.
These risks are being continuously monitored by the relevant
departments within the Group.

In November 2008, RTL II filed legal actions against IP
Deutschland, a wholly owned subsidiary of RTL Group, and
Seven One Media (“SOM”) as a result of the proceedings in
2007 of the German Federal Cartel Office against the discount
scheme agreements (“share deals”) offered by IP Deutschland
and SOM. RTL II's claim is currently limited to access to infor-
mation on the basis of which the claimants want to prove that
they suffered damages from these discount schemes. The
court of first instance in Dusseldorf decided to order an expert
report.

At the end of January 2013, Kabel Deutschland (KDG)
appealed a decision of the German Federal Cartel Office to
settle a case in accordance with section 32b of the German
Act Against Restraints of Competition following commit-
ments of the channels of Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland to
broadcast digital channels in standard quality unencrypted
and to refrain from certain restrictions on the usage of digital
signals in standard quality. The preliminary oral proceeding is
scheduled for September 2014.

Foreign investments in media companies in the People’s
Republic of China are subject to restrictions. In order to com-
ply with local legal provisions, some of the Bertelsmann par-
ticipations in China are held by trustees. Bertelsmann has
agreements with these trustees with respect to the securing

of Bertelsmann’s rights. This type of structure is common for
investments in China and has been tolerated by the Chinese
authorities for many years. However, a basic risk exists that
it will not be possible to safeguard such structures through
Chinese courts if the People’s Republic should change its poli-
cies toward foreign investment and, for example, no longer
recognize offshore investments in general or in the media area
in particular. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that Chinese
authorities or courts in the future will interpret existing provi-
sions differently from the previous practice. In the event that
legal violations can be proven, in an extreme case, Bertelsmann
could be exposed to considerable fines and the revocation of
business licenses leading to immediate closure of participa-
tions in China. This would affect Arvato and Gruner + Jahr
companies as well as Bertelsmann Asia Investments (BAI).
In the past, however, such extreme measures by the Chinese
authorities have only been reported in exceptional cases.

Aside from the matters outlined above, no further significant
legal and regulatory risks to Bertelsmann are apparent at this
time.

Financial Market Risks

As an international corporation, Bertelsmann is exposed to
various forms of financial market risk, especially interest rate
and currency risks. These risks are largely controlled centrally
on the basis of guidelines established by the Executive Board.
Derivative financial instruments are used solely for hedging
purposes. Bertelsmann uses currency derivatives mainly to
hedge recorded and future transactions involving foreign cur-
rency risk. Some firm commitments denominated in foreign
currency are partially hedged when they are made, with the
hedged amount increasing over time. A number of subsid-
iaries are based outside the euro zone. The resulting transla-
tion risk is managed based on economic debt in relation to
operating EBITDA (leverage factor). Bertelsmann’s long-term
focus is on the maximum leverage factor permitted for the
Group. Foreign currency translation risks arising from net
investments in foreign entities are not hedged. Interest rate
derivatives are used centrally for the balanced management of
interest rate risk. The cash flow risk from interest rate changes
is centrally monitored and controlled as part of interest rate
management. The aim is to achieve a balanced ratio of dif-
ferent fixed interest rates by selecting appropriate maturity
periods for the originated financial assets and liabilities affect-
ing liquidity, and through the ongoing use of interest rate
derivatives. The liquidity risk is regularly monitored on the
basis of the planning calculation. The existing syndicated loan,

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2013 89


--- Page 29 ---

as well as appropriate liquidity provisions, form a sufficient
risk buffer for unplanned payments. Counterparty risks exist
in the Group in invested cash and cash equivalents and in the
default of a counterparty in derivatives transactions. Finan-
cial transactions and financial instruments are restricted to a
rigidly defined group of banks with an excellent credit rating.
Existing risks from investing cash and cash equivalents are
continuously monitored. Financial investments are generally
made on a short-term basis so that the investment volume
can be reduced if the credit rating changes (see also further
explanatory remarks on “Financial Risk Management” in
section 25 of the Notes).

Overall Risk

The overall risk position has increased year on year primarily
due to the increase in business volume through the Penguin
Random House merger. The risks arising from the process
of integrating the two companies are shown as an individual
risk. Risks from technological challenges that were included
in the top ten Group risks last year remain but they have
become less significant. The continuing digital transforma-
tion of businesses is already largely anticipating the techno-
logical changes so that the risks in this connection are being
increasingly reflected in other operating risks such as pricing
and margin risks. As a result of the diversification of Group
businesses, there are no concentration risks stemming from
dependency on individual business partners or products in
either procurement or sales. The Group’s financial position is
solid, with liquidity needs currently covered by existing liquid-
ity and available credit facilities.

No risks endangering Bertelsmann’s continued existence
were identified in financial year 2013, nor are any substan-
tial risks discernible from the current perspective that could
threaten the continued existence of the Group.

Opportunity Management System

An. efficient opportunity management system enables
Bertelsmann to secure its corporate success in the long term
and to exploit potential in an optimum way. Opportunities are
possible future developments or events that could result in a
positive deviation from outlook or objective for Bertelsmann.
The opportunity management system, like the RMS, is an
integral component of the business processes and company
decisions. During the planning process, the significant oppor-
tunities are determined each year, from the profit center level
upward, and then aggregated step by step at the division and
Group levels. By systematically recording them on several
reporting levels, opportunities that arise can be identified and

90 Financial Information Group Management Report

exploited at an early stage. This also creates an interdivisional
overview of Bertelsmann’s current opportunities. A review of
major changes in opportunities is conducted at divisional level
every six months. In addition, the largely decentralized opportu-
nity management system is coordinated by central departments
in the Group. The department of Business Development and
New Businesses continuously pursues strategic opportu-
nity potential and seeks to derive synergies through targeted
cooperation in the individual divisions. The interdivisional
experience transfer is reinforced by regular meetings of the
Group Management Committee.

Opportunities

While the opportunities associated with positive develop-
ment may be accompanied by corresponding risks, certain
risks are entered into in order to exploit potential opportu-
nities. This close link to the key Group risks offers strategic,
operational, legal, regulatory and financial opportunities for
Bertelsmann.

Strategic opportunities can be derived primarily from the
Group's four strategic priorities. Strengthening core busi-
nesses, driving forward the digital transformation, developing
growth platforms and expanding in growth regions consti-
tute the most important long-term growth opportunities for
Bertelsmann (see section “Strategy”). In particular, there are
general opportunities for exploiting synergies as a result of
the portfolio expansions. Furthermore, there is potential in
the existing divisions for efficiency improvements and the
possibility of more favorable economic development as well
as individual operational opportunities. For RTL Group, the TV
advertising markets in some core markets could develop bet-
ter than expected. The many different possible applications
for the increasingly digital means of distribution will allow
RTL Group to target their end customers and advertising
customers more effectively. At Penguin Random House, suc-
cessful debut publications, strong market growth and higher
e-book revenues provide further opportunities. Gruner + Jahr
has opportunities in international markets through new and
digital businesses. In the magazine business, growth may
be achieved particularly in Spain, China and India through
higher advertising revenues. At Arvato, the ongoing trend
toward outsourcing and the successful development of new
businesses are creating opportunities. Arvato could ben-
efit in particular from higher growth of SCM activities in the
e-commerce, high-tech and health-care segments and addi-
tional new business from the CRM Solution Group. There
are also opportunities for growth in the Solution Groups:
IT Solutions, Financial Solutions, Digital Marketing and Print
Solutions. The Be Printers print businesses, particularly in


--- Page 30 ---

Southern Europe, may decline less steeply through additional
volume and new customers. This would provide opportu-
nities from the targeted servicing of market segments that
are still growing. At Corporate Investments, there is potential
for growth thanks to lower restructuring costs in the Club and
Direct Marketing businesses. In addition, potential artist sign-
ings or music catalog takeovers could offer growth opportu-
nities for BMG. The current innovation efforts detailed in the
“Innovations” section offer further potential opportunities for
the individual divisions.

Other opportunities could arise from changes to the legal and
regulatory environment.

The financial opportunities are largely based on a favor-
able development of interest and exchange rates from
Bertelsmann’s point of view.

Outlook

Anticipated Overall Economic Development

Bertelsmann anticipates the economic conditions will develop
as follows in 2014. In the reporting period, the subdued global
growth dynamic of recent years is expected to accelerate
slightly. The Institute for the World Economy at the University
of Kiel (If) forecasts that the global economy will grow by
3.7 percent in real terms in 2014. The recovery based on the
gradually stabilizing economic conditions in Europe and the
ongoing course of recovery in the United States is being sup-
ported by the continuing expansive monetary policy. How-
ever, compared with the high level of previous years, fewer
growth stimuli for the global economy are expected from the
threshold countries.

For the United States, the IfW expects real growth of 2.3 per-
cent in 2014. According to the IfW forecast, the euro zone will
strengthen over the course of 2014 and achieve a real growth
rate of 0.9 percent. The European Central Bank estimates that
the economy in the euro zone will benefit from a recovery in
domestic demand and a gradual increase in the demand for
exports. Nonetheless, European economic development will
still be adversely affected by the consolidation measures of
indebted member states as well as by high unemployment. In
view of the clear upturn in the UK, real growth of 2.0 percent
is expected in 2014. The recovery of the euro zone will also
improve German economic development. For 2014, the IfW
expects real growth of 1.7 percent in Germany. Domestic
stimuli are playing a key role in the positive expectations.
Private consumption benefited from favorable employment
and income prospects, and investments are being driven by

the improving global economic environment and the easing
of uncertainty.

Anticipated Development in Relevant Markets

The worldwide media industry is primarily influenced by
global economic developments and the resulting growth
dynamic. The continued trend toward digitization of content
and distribution channels, changes in media usage and the
increasing influence of threshold countries will continue to
present risks and opportunities in the years to come. Through
the intended transformation of the Group portfolio in line with
the four strategic priorities, Bertelsmann expects to benefit to
an increasing extent from the resulting opportunities. Through
its businesses, Bertelsmann operates in a variety of differ-
ent markets and regions whose developments are subject to
a range of factors and do not respond in a linear fashion to
overall economic tendencies. The following takes into account
only those markets and regions that are large enough to be
relevant for forecasting purposes and whose expected devel-
opment can be appropriately aggregated and evaluated.

In 2014, a stable overall development in the TV advertising
markets in Germany and Benelux, declines in France and a
slight to moderate recovery in Southern and Eastern Europe
is expected. The English-, German- and Spanish-language
book markets are expected to show largely stable develop-
ment in 2014. In the magazine business, the advertising and
circulation markets in Germany, France, Spain and China in
2014 are expected to continue to decline. In 2014, the ser-
vices markets are expected to achieve growth similar to 2013,
and the storage media markets are expected to continue to
decline at the same rate as in the previous year. The European
print markets for magazines, catalogs and promotional mate-
rials and the print market for books in the United States are
expected to continue to decline in 2014.

Expected Performance

Despite the gradually easing uncertainty over economic devel-
opments, the forecasts are still subject to certain risks. The
following expectations are therefore based on the assumption
that the normalization of the overall economic situation will
continue, and that most of the forecast market developments
and the economic predictions of the research institutions will
be realized.

Bertelsmann’s business development will be determined by
the diversity of some of its businesses. The presence in dif-
ferent markets and regions reduces possible fluctuations and
has a stabilizing effect. For financial year 2014, Bertelsmann

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2013 91


--- Page 31 ---

anticipates that the positive business development will be
driven by the stable market expectations for the TV adver-
tising markets in Germany and Benelux, the stable book
markets and the continuously growing service markets. The
growth stimuli created in financial year 2013 through the
strategic portfolio expansions will have a positive impact on
Bertelsmann’s growth profile over the next few years. The
accelerated scaling back of structurally declining businesses —
in particular, print, replication, Club and Direct Marketing — will
also help to mitigate their negative impact.

In addition to the assumed market developments, the pre-
dicted economic developments in the geographic core markets
of Western Europe and the United States are the basis of the
expected business development. With the revenue and earn-
ings share within the euro zone expected to remain at around
75 percent, the extent of growth is based on the forecasted real
and nominal economic development. The IfW assumes that
GDP in the euro zone will increase by 2.2 percent in nominal
terms and by 0.9 percent in real terms in 2014. The OECD pre-
dicts that GDP in the euro zone will increase by 2.0 percent in
nominal terms and by 1.0 percent in real terms in 2014. In view
of these economic forecasts, Bertelsmann expects a stable
development of Group revenues for 2014. Taking into account
the strategic portfolio expansions made in the reporting period
but not included for the whole year as of December 31, 2013,
Bertelsmann expects a significant increase in Group revenues
in financial year 2014. Despite incurring start-up losses for
digitization projects and new businesses, Bertelsmann expects
stable to slightly increasing operating EBIT compared with
the previous year, which will more than offset the negative
impact of structurally declining businesses. As a result of the

92 Financial Information Group Management Report

strategic portfolio expansions in financial year 2013, which are
taken into account for the full year’s period for the first time
in 2014 as well as higher operating investments, Bertelsmann
anticipates a significant increase in the level of invested capital
in financial year 2014. Consequently, a low overall return on
investment and a strong fall in BVA are expected.

The revenues of Penguin Random House will be strongly
above the previous year’s figure as they are taken into account
for the full year’s period in the consolidated financial state-
ments for financial year 2014. Otherwise, the expected per-
formance of any individual unit of key significance for the
Bertelsmann Group is not expected to deviate significantly
from that of the Group.

Depending on how the economy develops, Bertelsmann does
not currently anticipate interest rate changes to have any
material impact on the average financing costs of medium-
to long-term financing. The liquidity situation in the forecast
period is expected to be sufficient.

These forecasts are based on Bertelsmann’s current business
strategy as outlined in the “Business and Economic Conditions”
section. In general, the forecasts reflect careful consideration
of risks and opportunities and are based on operational plan-
ning and the medium-term outlook for the corporate divisions.
