Dear Shareholder,

Banco Sabadell ended the year 2012, the 131st in its history, showing good income growth,
improved business margins and a substantially stronger liquidity position, having reinforced
its core capital and exceeded the levels of capital required to pass the stress tests carried
out on the Spanish financial sector. All of this was achieved despite an operating environment
characterised by continuing financial market turmoil, weak economic activity and, in Spain, a
financial industry undergoing a process of radical reform and root-and-branch restructuring.

In the first half of the year, the eurozone sovereign debt crisis had a particularly severe impact
on Spain and the fragmentation of capital markets highlighted the difficulties of the euro. The
action taken by the European authorities to tackle the crisis from the middle of the year onwards
brought about an improvement in the funding position of the systemic countries on the European
periphery. In particular, Europe decided to take more resolute steps towards economic, fiscal and
financial integration, while the European Central Bank launched a new programme of sovereign
bond purchases, thus effectively making itself a lender of last resort to the treasuries of the euro
zone’s more solvent countries.

On the economic front, global activity in 2012 was characterized by weakness in the eurozone
and particularly in Spain, although economies in the rest of the world moved in a more positive
direction. The Spanish economy struggled under the prevailing difficult financial conditions and
activity was further constrained by a tight fiscal policy and private sector deleveraging, causing
the economy to go into reverse again after having grown slightly in 2011.

In late June the Spanish authorities asked for external financial assistance for the banking
sector. In line with the promises made to obtain the assistance, the country’s financial sector has
been undergoing a major programme of reform and large-scale restructuring and recapitalization
under the supervision of the Spanish authorities and according to guidelines laid down by the
European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF.

Key conditions for restoring Spain’s banks to financial health were that banks should set
aside large amounts of provisions to cover their real estate assets and that, following an in-depth
external assessment, some banks would be recapitalized from public funds and their troubled
assets transferred to an asset management company (to be known as SAREB) whose capital
would largely be funded by the state through the Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (FROB).

Despite the difficulties facing the sector, Banco Sabadell was given a clean bill of health in
the stress tests carried out on the whole of the Spanish banking industry in 2012, being classed
among the most solvent of the systemic banks making up the Spanish financial system.

Our core capital was greatly strengthened during the year, with share capital increasing by
€3,092 million. Actions such as the exchange of Banco Sabadell preferred securities for ordinary
shares in January, the exchange of Banco CAM preferred and subordinated securities for Banco
Sabadell ordinary shares in June and July, and the capital-raising rights issue in March, brought
the core capital ratio up to 10.4%, and this at a time when we were absorbing the Banco CAM
balance-sheet.

Our liquidity position improved substantially in the course of the year thanks in large measure
to a high inflow of new customer accounts, allowing us to generate a positive funding gap of more
than €15,000 million in 2012 on the back of the demand for investment products.

Energetic balance-sheet management, careful setting of interest spreads and a strong
performance in winning new business made it possible to end the year with net interest income
up 21.5% and gross operating income up 18% on the year before. Profit before impairment
provisions was €1,289.9 million, a year-on-year increase of 4.8% with Banco CAM administrative
expenses included; on a like-for-like basis, however, recurring costs for 2012 were down 5.9% on
the year before.

Banco Sabadell’s net profit for the year 2012 was €81.9 million after setting aside in balance-
sheet strengthening and asset impairment provisions totalling €2,540.6 million — 142.2% more
than the previous year.

Once again Banco Sabadell was able to report a remarkable achievement in new customer
acquisition. With enrolments reaching 8,000 a week, the number of individual customers rose by
18.2% and business customers by 31.4% compared with the previous year.


--- Page 2 ---

After a year in which default rates in the banking system continued to rise, Banco Sabadell
ended 2012 with a loan loss ratio that remained below the industry average; the gap with respect to
the ratio for the banking industry as a whole has increased by a factor of 2.6 over the last two years.

The year 2012 saw the successful completion of merger and integration processes for four
entities: Banco CAM, Banco Urquijo and Banco Guipuzcoano in Spain, and Lydian Private Bank in
the USA. Once again the Banco Sabadell group demonstrated its proven ability to carry out such
processes alongside its ordinary activities without any impact on operating efficiency or service
quality, or disruption to the conduct of business.

The integration of Banco CAM was of particular significance in bringing about a transformative
leap for Banco Sabadell and positioning us as Spain’s fourth largest privately-owned banking
group. Total group assets increased by more than 60% and the group’s customer base doubled
to more than 5.5 million. The actions we have put in hand to ensure a successful relaunch of the
branch network under the new SabadellCAM brand name, and our determination to win back the
trust of customers of the former Banco CAM as soon as possible, have been key factors in kick-
starting a recovery in deposits and restoring market shares to their historic levels.

By the end of the year we had brought the integration of Banco CAM operations and systems
to a successful conclusion and thus fulfilled our ambitious work schedule to the letter.

With Banco Urquijo and Banco Guipuzcoano now merged into the organization we were able,
first, to position the SabadellUrquijo brand as the name to watch in private banking in Spain
and, second, to increase our potential for growth in the northern part of the country under the
SabadellGuipuzcoano banner.

In the USA we continued to make progress in growing our retail banking operation in Miami,
Florida: Sabadell United Bank. We completed the integration of Lydian Private Bank’s operations
and systems into those of Sabadell United Bank, strengthening its position and making it the
seventh largest local bank by deposits. We also opened a representative office in New York which
is proving to be a useful complement to our Miami-based operation.

This year we set up an Asset Management division, a special unit tasked with managing the
group’s real estate and doubtful assets. By so doing we put ourselves a step ahead of the rest of
the industry and became pioneers in creating a dedicated operating unit to respond effectively to
the needs generated by the real estate crisis.

Finally, in the last part of the year, we came to an agreement with Banco Mare Nostrum (BMN)
to purchase its branch banking business in Catalonia and Aragon; we hope to bring this to a
conclusion in the course of 2013.

This annual report contains accurate and detailed information on major developments
during year 2012 and on how the group has performed in the current highly complex economic
and financial environment. The data provided here reflects the soundness and the growth of
our ordinary operations and evidences the group’s capacity to generate positive results despite
the enormous efforts made to increase provisions while continuing to boost liquidity and add
strength to our balance-sheet.

This year Banco Sabadell prepared the ground for a progressive return to reasonable levels
of profitability after several years of setting aside very large amounts in provisioning expenses to
face the consequences of the economic crisis.

We laid the foundations for the Bank’s future development by absorbing organizations that
were unable to remain competitive on their own; they will now provide the group with a regional
foothold for business expansion in the coming years.

The professionalism of the Banco Sabadell group and the expertise it has shown in
managing the crisis give us reason to be optimistic about prospects for getting our earnings
back to normal levels.

—Macroeconomic Environment

The sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone worsened in the first half
of the year, with particularly virulent effects on countries like Spain
and Italy. The prevailing complex environment was reflected in an
increasingly fragmented capital market, highlighting the difficulties
of the single European currency. This coincided with a social and
political situation in Greece that continued to be especially critical,
giving rise to a significant risk to have to finally leave the euro. Two
general elections were required before the country was able to
establish a government, and Greece became the first developed
country since the Second World War to restructure its sovereign
debt, forcing private creditors to take a debt haircut.

The actions taken in response to the crisis by the European
authorities halfway through the year brought about a considerable
improvement in the situation, producing an incipient reversal

in the disintegration of the eurozone capital market and some
improvement in the funding position of the systemic countries

on the European periphery. Moreover, fears of a possible exit

by Greece were gradually allayed by the European authorities’
determination to keep the country within the single currency.

In Europe the decision was taken to move more resolutely towards
European integration. A road map was produced setting out the
basic building blocks of financial union, with proposals for greater
economic and fiscal integration being left for implementation in
2013. The first step in building this financial framework will be to
establish a single banking supervisor which will make it possible
for the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to recapitalize the
banks directly, thus breaking the link between financial risk and
sovereign risk.

On the fiscal front, another significant aspect was a certain
shift in the European stance on fiscal consolidation. In particular,
more importance was given to measures to correct fiscal
imbalances, and less on commitments to numerical targets, given
that these were being affected by the difficult economic conditions
then prevailing.

Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to
implement a new programme of bond purchases (outright
monetary transactions, OMT), linked to requests to the ESM by
countries in difficulty for a programme of financial assistance.
The bond purchases must consist mainly of short-dated
government bonds and will not be subject to any quantitative
limits. This decision brought about a fundamental change in the
sovereign debt crisis. By taking this step, the ECB was practically
guaranteeing that no systemic eurozone country would be frozen
out of the primary market for government debt, provided that the
conditionality attaching to the provision of financial assistance by
the ESF was fulfilled.

In late June the Spanish authorities made a request for external
financial assistance for the banking sector as part of their efforts
to restructure and recapitalize the country’s banks. The amount
of financial assistance could be as much as €100 billion and the
conditions on which it would be provided included: (i) determining
the capital requirements of each institution: (ii) recapitalizing,
restructuring and/or resolving the less viable banks; and (iii)
transferring the impaired assets of banks requiring government
support to an asset management company (known as SAREB).

Despite a more benign financial environment in the second half
of the year the global economy remained weak all through 2012,
especially in the eurozone and most particularly in countries on the
European periphery, with countries like Spain and Italy suffering the
consequences of tight credit conditions. In Spain, fiscal tightening
and private sector deleveraging also affected economic activity.

In the United States the economic environment was affected by
uncertainties caused by the difficulty in reaching an agreement over
the fiscal cliff. In Japan, the conflict with China over the Sendaku
islands deepened the economic gloom. The emerging economies
provided yet another headwind to global growth, with contagion from
other countries adding to the effects of domestic tightening in the
main economies as they strove for more balanced growth.

Against this background, the monetary policies of the world’s main
central banks remained highly accommodative, with large amounts
of liquidity being injected into the economy. In the USA, the Federal
Reserve continued its programme of asset purchases and took

a decision to make the setting of interest rates dependent on
numerical threshold levels of unemployment and inflation. The
ECB, in addition to its new bond purchasing programme (OMT)

and its second three-year funding operation, continued to provide
full allotment in its refinancing operations, relaxed its rating
requirements for collateral and reduced its key rate to historically
low levels (0.75%). This highly accommodative monetary policy and
the prevailing risk-adverse conditions ensured that government
bond yields in the core eurozone countries remained close to zero
in the second half of the year, and even entered negative territory
in some cases. The Bank of Japan expanded its unorthodox
monetary programmes, especially by increasing purchases of
government bonds. It also established an inflation target. Finally,
the Bank of England increased its holdings of assets acquired
under its programme of asset purchases and introduced further
unconventional measures (such as providing liquidity to banks
linked to their lending to the private sector).

In the long-term public debt markets US and German bond yields
remained at historically low levels thanks to their status as refuges
for the huge amounts of cash circulating in the market. Spanish
and Italian government debt remained under pressure throughout
the first half of the year, reaching levels which threatened to exclude
Spain and Italy (especially the former) from obtaining funding from
the capital markets,. The second half of the year, however, saw a
substantial improvement, especially after the ECB took a more
prominent role in addressing the sovereign debt crisis. Yields on
the debt of other peripheral countries ended the year at levels
considerably below those prevailing at the beginning of the year.
lreland benefited from expectations of possible restructuring as

a result of the government's bail-out plan for the financial system,
which would ease pressure on the public accounts in that country.
Greek debt found support in factors such as the reduced likelihood
of the country exiting the eurozone, the offer of more generous
bail-out terms, and the relative success of its debt repurchasing
programme. Finally, Portuguese debt benefited from Europe’s
support for its policy of fiscal tightening and subsequent easing.

On the currency markets the euro fell against the dollar on
uncertainties over the single currency. As the year progressed,
measures taken to address European instability and the Fed’s
decision to take further unconventional measures helped the euro
to regain lost ground and to finish the year higher against the dollar.
During the year the yen suffered two major bouts of weakness. The
currency fell between February and March in response to the Bank
of Japan’s more accommodating monetary stance, while in the final
part of the year it was undermined by worsening macroeconomic
data in Japan and the new government's interventionist approach.

Equity markets in the USA and most of the main eurozone
countries registered positive returns at the end of the year despite
the reverses suffered by European stocks in the second quarter
as a result of renewed financial instability in the region. Over the
year as a whole, the Euro Stoxx 50 index rose by 13.8%, while the
Spanish IBEX fell by 4.7%. In the USA, the S&P 500 index managed
to end the year with an 11.4% rise in euro terms.

—Share performance

Banco Sabadell's inclusion in the "zero group" of banks judged
most solvent in the stress tests conducted by consultancy Oliver
Wyman and the positive market reaction to the take-over of Banco
CAM were key factors driving an improved performance by Banco
Sabadell's share price.

In 2012 the share price was dragged down by the weak economic
environment and fears over the position of Spain's financial system,
especially in the early months of the year. Despite the challenging
conditions facing the sector, however, Banco Sabadell's capital-
raising exercise in March was very well received by the market. The
acquisition of Banco CAM was viewed in a very positive light and
enabled Banco Sabadell to consolidate its position as Spain's fourth
largest privately-owned banking group, increase its market share and
secure a more evenly balanced presence in the country.

From June onwards a number of factors helped Banco
Sabadell's share price to break away from the trend by its Spanish
industry peers. The published results of independent audits
carried out on the banking sector, plus the strengthening of Banco
Sabadell’s provisioning and the confirmation of its position as one
of the most solvent banks in the industry were all key contributors
to a stronger share price. This strength was particularly evident
in the months of June and August, when the share price rose
by 20% and 48% respectively. In the latter part of the year the
improved outlook for Spain and the positive assessment of Banco
Sabadell's heads of terms agreement with BMN to take over its
operations in Catalonia and Aragon provided further support for
the share price relative to its domestic market peers.

Banco Sabadell’s capital-raising actions in 2012 included three
new share issues in the months of January, March and July.

Early in December 2011 a decision was taken to make a
buyback offer to the holders of preferred securities issued by
different Banco Sabadell group undertakings and sold to private
individual investors. The preferred securities were to be exchanged
for ordinary shares of Banco Sabadell. The process was completed
on 3 January 2012 with the offer securing a 93.8% acceptance
rate, a clear sign of its popularity among the small investors who
were the main holders of the preferred securities. The result
was to increase the share capital of the Bank by the issue of
223,179,763 new shares (representing 13.83% of its ordinary
share capital). The offer was carried out for the dual purpose of
giving holders of preferred securities the opportunity to liquidate
their holdings and replace them with Banco Sabadell ordinary
shares, while at the same time reinforcing the structure of the
Bank’s capital overall.

An Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company was called
by the Board of Directors of Banco Sabadell to take place on 23
February 2012. The Meeting approved an increase in capital to
be paid in cash, subject to a right of preferential subscription
and to the possibility of the issue not being fully subscribed;
it authorized the Board of Directors to carry out the increase
in capital on any terms it considered expedient, except as
specifically determined by the Meeting.

The subscription period for taking up shares offered in the
increase in capital came to an end on 23 March 2012. The overall
nominal amount of the increase was €85,469,329.13 and the
overall effective amount was €902,556,116.88. The increase
was effected by the issue and allotment of 683,754,633 ordinary
shares, each with a nominal value of €0.125, of the same class
and series as those then in issue.

The main purpose of the increase in capital was to strengthen
the Bank's core capital (i.e. capital and reserves). Although the
Bank's capital resources were compliant with existing capital
adequacy requirements, the increase in capital enabled Banco
Sabadell to strengthen its share capital base and provided it with
additional high-quality capital resources should there ever be a
need to meet stricter capital requirements.

On 26 March trading in the new shares formally commenced
on the Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia stock exchanges via the
Spanish stock exchange’s electronic trading system [mercado
continuo].

At a meeting of the Board of Directors on 13 June 2012 the
Board, in the exercise of powers granted to it by a resolution of
the Annual General Meeting of 31 May 2012, made a decision
to increase the share capital of the Bank by issuing new shares
payable in cash; no right of preferential subscription would apply
to the issue, which was subject to the possibility of not being
fully subscribed. The issue was directed exclusively to all holders
of certain Banco CAM group issues of preferred securities and
subordinated debt willing to accept a public offer for sale of
existing shares, or subscribe for new shares, in Banco Sabadell.

At the end of the offer acceptance period on 27 July 2012
(which achieved a 95.7% acceptance rate), the total number
of shares of the Bank to be issued and sold as a result of the
application by holders of the preferred securities of acash sum
equivalent to 100% of the nominal value of the repurchased
preferred shares, was 678,194,488 (of which 22,000,000 were
treasury shares and 656,194,488 were new shares representing
22.21% of the ordinary share capital of the Bank resulting from
the offer). These new shares were admitted to trading on the stock
exchange's electronic trading system on 13 August 2012.

On the conclusion, on 20 July 2012, of the third period for
the voluntary conversion of mandatorily convertible subordinated
notes issue |/2009, at a meeting of the Board of Directors on 26
July 2012 the Board took a decision to increase the capital of the
Bank by issuing 693,247 new shares to provide funds for voluntary
conversions of the 2,898 subordinated notes comprising issue
1/2009. The new shares were admitted to trading on the electronic
trading system on 13 August 2012.

By 9 November 2012, the end of the second period for the
voluntary conversion of mandatorily convertible subordinated notes
Issue |/2010, issued to be offered in exchange for shares in Banco
Guipuzcoano, S.A. as part of a take-over offer by Banco Sabadell,
applications to convert had been received from a total of 814
noteholders holding 3,925,686 notes which, under the terms of the
issue, were equivalent in value to a total of 4,684,169 shares.

On 14 August 2012 the new shares were admitted to trading
on the Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia stock exchanges via the
electronic trading system [mercado continuo].

At the end of 2012 the number of Banco Sabadell ordinary
shares outstanding as a result of these capital-raising operations
was €2,959.55 million. Of the Bank’s overall shareholder base,
private investors accounted for 70.8% of the share capital, with
institutional investors holding the remaining 29.2%.

Active management of the balance sheet in terms of both
capital adequacy and risk exposure ensured that the surplus of
available capital resources over minimum capital requirements
was maintained. The Bank's capital position and its management
of that position are viewed positively by the market.

Balance sheet management

—A good inflow of new deposits and an active ALM policy
have substantially improved our liquidity position

—A major injection of capital has strengthened our
balance sheet

On 1 June 2012 Banco Sabadell completed the acquisition of
100% of the shares of Banco CAM. A few months later, on 5
December, the merger of Banco CAM by absorption into Banco
Sabadell was officially registered, although the effective date of the
merger for accounting purposes was 1 June 2012. The changes

in the group's financial data for the year 2012 compared with
2011 therefore reflect the wide-ranging impact of the integration of
Banco CAM data during the year.

At the end of 2012 the assets of the Banco Sabadell group
totalled €161,547.1 million, rising by €61,109.7 million compared
with total group assets at 31 December 2011. The annual
increase in percentage terms was 60.8%.

Gross loans and advances to customers excluding reverse
repos totalled €115,392.4 million at 31 December 2012, up from
€73,635.3 million at the close of 2011, a 56.7 % increase. Of the
various components of gross loans and advances, the "secured
loans" category showed the strongest growth, increasing by
€20,865.7 million (up 55.0%).

The loan loss ratio (bad and doubtful loans as a proportion of total
qualifying loans and advances) at the close of 2012 stood at
9.3% — a figure from which assets subject to the Banco CAM
Asset Protection Scheme were excluded. The ratio was again
below the average for the Spanish financial sector as a whole.

In 2012 the Banco Sabadell group saw the value of its investment
portfolio increase by 78.8% compared with the previous year to
reach a year-end total of €25,713.8 million.

Banco Sabadell's portfolio of fixed-income investments is held,
first, as part of its arrangements for macro-hedging the group's
on-balance sheet interest rate risk; second, as a source of interest
returns to boost net interest income, subject always to complying
strictly with the established limits for interest rate risk; and third,
as part of a treasury management strategy of investing cash
surpluses in the securities markets.

The Bank ensures that the credit quality of overall asset positions
held in its fixed-income portfolio is of the highest order and that it
invests in assets with the highest ratings awarded by rating agencies.

Liquidity management and funding

The group's funding policy continued to focus on attracting deposits
and other customer accounts through the branch network. This
strategy was of particular relevance in an operating environment
where the capital markets remained closed for a considerable part of
the year 2012 as the sovereign debt crisis became more acute and
spreads on Spanish government debt over the German Bund climbed
to unprecedented heights, causing widespread uncertainty among
investors in Spain's financial sector. However, the determination of
the European Central Bank (ECB) to ensure the survival of the euro
and its September announcement that it would support any eurozone
country that needed supporting, combined with the publication by
the Bank of Spain, in September, of the results of stress tests carried
out as part of the process of recapitalizing and restructuring of the
Spanish banking industry, caused confidence to return to the capital
markets. The last quarter of the year saw some stabilization of debt
issuance and a tentative reopening of the markets.


--- Page 20 ---

—Ratings awarded to Banco Sabadell debt securities

As far as its wholesale market funding activities were
concerned Banco Sabadell, like the rest of the banking sector, saw
its ratings downgraded by the three major rating agencies, very
largely in response to lower sovereign credit ratings on Spain.

In another development, the Bank completed arrangements
to have its debt rated by the DBRS credit rating agency, and on 31
December 2012 it gave notice that it would not be renewing its
contract with Fitch Ratings as a setter of credit ratings for the group.

The group has a number of short- and long-term funding
programmes in place, giving it a suitable diversity of funding
sources and an appropriate diversity of products, maturities
and investors. Its short-term funding arrangements include a
Spanish commercial paper ("pagaré") issuance programme with
an upper limit of €5,000 million and a Euro Commercial Paper
(ECP) programme with a nominal value of up to €3,500 million.
The commercial paper programme is aimed primarily at domestic
investors and the amount outstanding under the programme
increased during the year, mainly through sales to unqualified
investors. The balance outstanding at 31 December was €3,222
million. The group's ECP programme, aimed at global qualified
investors, saw a modest increase from December 2011, when
there had been no issues outstanding under the ECP programme.
The balance at 31 December 2012 was €37 million.

As part of its longer-term funding, in 2012 Banco Sabadell
issued bonds totalling €3,845 million under its nonparticipating
securities issuance programme, designed for qualified and non-
qualified investors. It also made two public issues of 3-year and
2-year mortgage covered bonds (cédulas hipotecarias) for total
amounts of €1,200 and €500 million, respectively; two issues
of covered bonds underwritten by the European Investment Bank
(EIB) for a total of €295 million with terms of between eight and ten
years, and five issues of straight bonds aimed at the general public
for a total of €1,850 million, with terms of between 12 months and
two years.

In addition to these sources of funds, the Bank holds
a reserve of liquid assets —cash and assets realizable in
the short-term— which would enable it to face any liquidity
contingency. In the course of 2012 Banco Sabadell continued
to strengthen its liquid asset base by generating a positive
funding gap between deposits and loans —more than €15,000
million in 2012— via its branch network, and also by adding new
eligible loans totalling more than €4,150 million to the assets
pledged as collateral under its liquidity facility with the Bank
of Spain. This was made possible, first, by the more relaxed
admissibility criteria for assets eligible as collateral in monetary
policy operations approved by the Bank of Spain on 9 February;

and, second, by the arrangement of a €1,916.1 million loan

to the fund set up by the Spanish government for the purpose
of regularizing payments to suppliers of local and regional
governments. At 31 December Banco Sabadell's eligible liquid
asset base comprised more than €17,500 million in cash and
cash equivalents.

At 31 December Banco Sabadell's net position with the ECB
totalled €23,650 million as a result of the ECB's 3-year liquidity
auctions of 22 December 2011 and 1 March 2012, in which
Banco Sabadell and Banco CAM participated and were allotted
amounts of €4,000 and €7,500 million and €6,000 and €6,150
million respectively.

Banco Sabadell's liquidity management policy seeks to ensure
that its lending can be financed at a reasonable cost and within
a reasonable time so that liquidity risk is kept to a minimum. Its
standard liquidity management procedures are as follows:

—Each year a funding plan is drawn up based on the funding
needs identified for each business unit and the amount to be
raised on the capital markets, spread over a range of long- and
short-term funding programmes.

—Regular checks are made to see that the funding plan is being
adhered to and any deviations from the plan are identified for
each business unit and the funding plan updated accordingly.

—The Bank's short-term commitments, treasury position and
future projections are reviewed periodically to ensure that the
Bank has sufficient liquidity to meet its financing needs in the
long and short term.

—Banco Sabadell regularly updates its liquidity contingency
plan to ensure that it has sufficient liquid assets available to
respond effectively to any liquidity stress scenario that could
arise. At the same time it assesses the quality of its portfolio
of liquid assets by studying the sensitivity of these assets to
different ratings downgrade scenarios.

Profit performance in 2012

Despite the challenging economic and financial conditions, the
Banco Sabadell group ended the year 2012 with a net attributable
profit of €81.9 million after net provisions for loan defaults,
securities revaluations and real estate writedowns amounting

to €2,540.6 million. In the year 2011, when the group's net
attributable profit was €231.9 million, net provisions were
significantly lower at €1,048.9 million.

—A dynamic ALM policy and solid growth in customer
numbers are driving income generation
—Exceptional profits of €2,541 million allocated

in 2012 to boost provisions


--- Page 22 ---

At the close of 2012, net interest income totalled €1,868.0

million, rising by 21.5% on the previous year's figure. The inflow

of income from Banco CAM after June 2012, together with careful
management of interest spreads and an increased contribution from
the group's fixed-income investments helped to offset the negative
effect of the higher cost of borrowing on the capital markets.

Dividends received amounted to €9.9 million, up 12.7%
on 2011's figure of €8.8 million. Profits of equity-accounted
undertakings, on the other hand, were down on the previous year,
partly as a result of the sale of a number of equity holdings (Banco
del Bajio, for example) that had been returning good results.

Net fee and commission income was €628.7 million,
increasing by €55.1 million (up 9.6%) on the year. Income
categories showing particularly good growth were credit card fees,
current account charges and charges for other services.

Net income from trading in 2012 was €546.2 million. Key
contributors to this result included profits of €270.3 million
on disposals of fixed-income assets available for sale, €166.3
million on buybacks of asset-backed securities and redemptions
of securities issued by the group, and €132.2 from trading in
securities. In 2011 net income from trading had included profits
of €139.0 from securities trading and €87.1 million on a debt-for-
equity swap offer in the first quarter of the year (the issue and sale
of 126 million Banco Sabadell shares as part of an offer to buy
back preferred securities and subordinated debt at a discount).

Other operating income and expenses showed a net outflow
of €142.5 million compared with a net inflow of €8.2 million the
previous year. A major expenditure item in 2012 was the group's
€220.3 million contribution to the Bank Deposit Guarantee Fund,
a far higher amount than the €29.8 million paid to the Fund in the
previous year.

Operating expenses for 2012 were €1,511.6 million, of which
€22.2 million were non-recurring. Recurring costs in 2012 were
down 5.9% on a like-for-like basis compared with 2011. The cost:
income ratio with non-recurring costs excluded was 50.3% at the
close of the year.

The resulting operating profit (before impairment and other
provisions) for the year was €1,289.9 million, up 4.8% on the
previous year.

Net provisions for loan losses totalled €1,405.7 million,

a sharp rise on the 2011 figure of €512.4 million. Additional
provisions of €1,134.9 million were also set aside to cover
impairment losses on real estate and financial assets.

Gains realized on asset disposals during the year totalled
€15.4 million. This included the profit from the sale of the Bank's
shareholding in Banco del Bajio. Profits on asset disposals in
2011, at €5.7 million, were considerably lower.

The group's income statement for 2012 includes an income
item of €933.3 million in negative goodwill arising on the
acquisition of Banco CAM.

After deducting income tax and the share of profits attributable
to non-controlling interests, this leaves a net attributable group
profit for the year of €81.9 million, down from €231.9 million in
2011. At the close of 2012 the Tier capital and core capital ratios
stood at 10.4%, both ratios having increased from their year-end
levels in 2011 (9.9% and 9.0% respectively).

Net interest income

Net interest income for the year 2012 totalled €1,868.0 million,
up by 21.5% on the figure for 2011. The increase was due very
largely to the merger of Banco CAM from June 2012. Average
loans and advances to customers were up 29.6% while average
customer deposits also grew, rising by 24.7%.

Interest receivable on loans and advances to customers was
up from 4.05% in 2011 to 4.11% in 2012, an increase of 6 basis
points. On the other hand, capital market funding costs rose by
139 basis points; this was due mainly to the impact of deferred
fair value adjustments to the values of securities acquired as a
result of the take-over of Banco CAM. The cost of deposits and
other customer funds increased by just 2 basis points from 2.04%
in 2011 to 2.06% in 2012.

Interest spreads showed an improvement despite a climate of
falling interest rates, with 3-month Euribor averaging 0.6% over the
year compared with 1.4% in 2011. Skilful management of deposit
and lending rates helped to offset this decline in interest rates, with
the result that interest spreads moved up 4 basis points, rising from
2.01% in 2011 to 2.05% in 2012. However, net interest income
diminished as a proportion of average total assets, falling from
1.6% in 2011 to 1.4% in 2012. This fall was a consequence of the
integration of Banco CAM data, which included a higher proportion of
non-performing assets.

Fees and commissions (net)

Net fee and commission income reached a year-end total of
€628.7 million, up 9.6% on the figure for 2011. This growth was to
a large extent due to the integration of Banco CAM data from June
2012 onwards.

Service-related fees and commissions were up 19.5%, with
credit card fees, payment order fees and other customer service
charges all showing good growth. Fees and commissions related
to loan and guarantee risks were also up on the year before, with
a 10.6% rise that was helped by similar upward shifts in loan-
related charges and in fees chargeable on avals and other bank
guarantees. Management fees on mutual funds and commissions
on sales of pension funds and insurance were down 14.1% overall
on the year, reflecting general market trends over the period.

General administrative expenses

Administrative expenses for the year 2012 were €1,511.6 million,
an increase of 32.0% on the previous year which reflected the
integration of administrative expenses for Banco CAM from June
2012 onwards. Of this €1,511.6 million, €22.2 million were
non-recurring expenses. Recurring expenses in 2012 were down
5.9% on a like-for-like basis compared with the previous year. In
particular, the various measures put in hand as part of the group's
operating efficiency programme, both in branch-level administrative
processes and other areas, resulted in a reduction of 3.9% in like-
for-like personnel expenses. Other recurring administrative costs,
again on a like-for-like basis, showed an even better result, falling by
9.3% compared with the figure for 2011.

—Acquisition
of Banco CAM


--- Page 28 ---

On 7 December 2011 Banco Sabadell made a successful bid for
Banco CAM in a competitive bidding process organized by the Fund
for Orderly Bank Restructuring (Spanish initials: FROB) following
the reorganization of the Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM).

The take-over deal was agreed on financial terms that
included risk limitation provisions. It had a strategic impact as it
substantially extended the Bank's existing franchise in Alicante,
Murcia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands.

The take-over arrangements were drawn up according to
parameters that were set out in the bidding conditions. A contract
containing a promise to carry out a sale and purchase of shares
was concluded by the FROB, the Deposit Guarantee Fund (Spanish
initials: F@D) and Banco Sabadell; and a protocol on the provision
of financial assistance for a restructuring of Banco CAM was
signed by Banco CAM, Banco Sabadell, the FROB and the FGD.

Once all required permissions had been obtained and the
Banco CAM restructuring plan had been approved by the European
Commission, the FGD increased its capital by €2,449 million in
addition to the €2,800 million it had already disbursed and Banco
Sabadell was then able to purchase 100% of the shares of Banco
CAM for the price of one euro.

As a result of the acquisition an Asset Protection Scheme (APS)
came into effect, as agreed in the protocol on financial assistance
for the restructuring of Banco CAM, with retroactive effect as from
31 July 2011. Under the APS, for a specified portfolio of assets
with a gross value of €24,660 million, the FGD would underwrite
80% of all losses on the portfolio for a period of ten years, once all
provisions made in respect of those assets had been absorbed.

—The integration of Banco CAM operations and
systems — one of 2012's major achievements

Banco Sabadell then gave an undertaking, as part of the
approval process, to carry out an integration plan drawn up by
FROB officials. This would involve the closure of 450 branches of
the combined undertaking and staff reductions of approximately
2,200 by 31 December 2013.

In December 2012 Banco CAM, S.A.U. was formally merged by
absorption into Banco de Sabadell; in the same month the process
of business systems integration was completed and the new
SabadellCAM brand was launched.

The SabadellCAM branches have been merged seamlessly with
the rest of the group. The results of the SabadellCAM campaign
in the last quarter of 2012 to generate new business were better
than expected, winning a total of 7,335 new customers and
securing €1,286 million in deposits and other funds.

The Banco CAM acquisition represented a transformative leap
for Banco Sabadell. It enabled the Bank to contemplate a future
that assures it of a place among Spain’s top banking groups, and
this at a crucial time when Spain’s financial system was subjected
to stress and under intense pressure to consolidate.

Banco Sabadell is at the head of Spain's fourth largest privately
owned banking group. The group offers a full range of banking
and financial services through its different financial institutions,
brands, subsidiaries and associates. The group's development
objectives are strongly focused on profitable growth and the
generation of shareholder value through a strategy of business
diversification based on high returns, efficiency and quality of
service together with a conservative risk profile, while maintaining
high standards of ethics and professional conduct combined with
sensitivity to stakeholders' interests.

The Bank has a business model that fosters long-term customer
relationships through constant efforts to promote customer loyalty
and by adopting an initiative-based, proactive approach. The Bank
offers a comprehensive range of products and services, competent,
highly qualified personnel, an IT platform with ample capacity to
support future growth and a relentless focus on quality. The group
has four main areas of business: Commercial Banking; Corporate
Banking and Global Businesses; Markets and Private Banking, and
BS America. It has seven regional divisions with full responsibility for
their areas, and several business-focused support teams.

Commercial Banking

Commercial Banking is the largest of the group's business lines. It
focuses on providing financial products and services to large and
medium-sized businesses, SMEs, retailers and sole proprietors,
professional groupings and other personal customers. Its high
degree of market specialization ensures that customers receive a
personalized service of the highest quality tailored to their needs,
whether from expert staff throughout its extensive branch network
or via other channels that support the customer relationship and
give access to remote banking services.

SabadellAtlantico, the group's flagship brand, operates in most
of the country’s regions except those served by other group brands,
namely: Asturias and Leon, an area served by the group's Banco
Herrero brand; the Basque Country, Navarre and La Rioja, where
the group is represented chiefly through its SabadellGuipuzcoano
network; and the Valencia and Murcia regions, once dominated
by the former Banco CAM, where the group’s brand is now
SabadellCAM. Its SabadellSolbank brand has the primary aim
of meeting the needs of Spanish-resident foreigners from other
European countries. It does this through a chain of specialist
branches operating only in the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands
and the country's southern and south-eastern mainland coastal
areas. Finally, ActivoBank is there to serve customers who prefer to
do their banking exclusively by telephone or online.

Corporate Banking and Global Businesses

Corporate Banking and Global Businesses offers a range of
products and services to large corporates and financial institutions
in Spain and abroad. Its activities embrace corporate banking,
structured finance, corporate finance, development capital,
international trade and consumer finance.


--- Page 32 ---

The Bank’s major clients are served by a team of expert
managers working from its offices in Madrid, Barcelona, London,
Paris and Miami. The group's business model in serving these
clients is based on a comprehensive offering of specialized
financing services and solutions, ranging from cash management
to more sophisticated, tailor-made solutions in such areas as
financing, treasury services and corporate finance.

In the area of structured finance Banco Sabadell has a team
that operates from offices in Madrid, Barcelona, the Basque
country, Miami and New York and has more than 20 years'
experience in originating and structuring deals, whether in the area
of corporate finance or project finance.

Sabadell Corporate Finance is a group subsidiary that
specializes in advising on mergers and acquisitions. It advises
corporate transactions such as company sales and acquisitions,
mergers and MBOs, assists companies in finding new or
replacement partners and provides independent value appraisals.

Banco Sabadell's development capital business focuses on
two main areas: taking temporary equity positions in non-financial
companies; and medium-term investments in energy projects, with
the accent on renewable forms of energy.

In its international business the Bank aims to be present
in the markets that are of most interest to companies actively
engaging in foreign trade. It does this by having a network of
foreign branches, subsidiaries and associates to support its
customers' operations in other countries; it also maintains
working arrangements with more than 2,800 correspondent
banks all over the world, thus providing customers with a further
assurance of genuinely global coverage.

Sabadell Fincom is a group subsidiary specializing in consumer
finance. Its principal business is providing point-of-sale finance for
the leasing or purchase of cars, computer equipment, domestic
appliances, health care accessories and other products.

Markets and Private Banking

Banco Sabadell's Markets and Private Banking division is made up
of several departments, namely SabadellUrquijo Banca Privada;
Investment, Products and Research; Treasury and Capital Markets;
Securities and custodian services; and Bancassurance. With a
service offering that includes research into investment alternatives,
market trading, active wealth management and custodian services,
the division covers all aspects of the investment process that are
regarded as critical by clients who rely on the Bank to manage their
savings.

Markets and Private Banking is well equipped to offer high
value products and services designed to secure the best possible
returns for customers, thanks to optimized investment and
investment management processes that depend on disciplined
analysis and professionalism of a high order.

Constant changes in the regulatory environment are a key
focus of attention for Markets and Private Banking, especially the
rules on investor protection and market transparency introduced
as a result of the European Financial Markets Directive (MiFID).
The Bank has a design and approval process for products and
services which ensures that the full range of offerings available

to customers more than meets their requirements in terms

of quality, returns and appropriateness to market conditions.
Moreover, the constant updating of procedures for investment risk
classification and customer risk profile assessment, coupled with
continuously evolving investment advice and monitoring tools and
methodologies, ensure a high degree of consistency across all
phases of the investment process.

BS America

The BS America operation comprises a number of business units,
associated undertakings and representative offices which together
provide financial services in the corporate banking, private banking
and commercial banking fields. The business is managed from
Miami, where Banco Sabadell has a full-service international
branch which has been in operation since 1993. In the course of
2012 the Bank opened a branch in New York which handles a large
part of the group's structured finance business.

During the year 2012 Banco Sabadell continued to pursue its
aim of consolidating its domestic banking operation in the state
of Florida through its subsidiary Sabadell United Bank. In June it
completed the work of integrating the IT systems of bank branches
acquired as a result of its acquisition of Lydian Private Bank, thus
further strengthening its local banking business in Florida. In the
same month it acquired the assets and liabilities of Banco CAM's
branch in Miami, which were then integrated with those of its
international full-service branch in that city. The Bank thus concluded
its fourth and fifth corporate actions in the state of Florida within a
five-year period that had already seen the acquisition of TransAtlantic
Bank in 2007, the take-over of BBVA's private banking business in
2008 and the purchase of Mellon United National Bank in 2010.

Banco Sabadell retained its interest in Banco BHD, a highly
regarded institution in the Dominican Republic. Its also maintains
representative offices in Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil and the
Dominican Republic for the convenience of customers in the
Americas region.

—Commercial Banking in 2012

In 2012, despite a highly complex operating environment, a major
promotional effort aimed at attracting new customers and deposits
through a strong local branch presence resulted in increased
market shares for the Bank.

Market segments

Companies, businesses, government and local authorities

A key aspect of the work of the Bank's branches in 2012, as
envisaged in the group's current 3-year strategic plan, was the
ongoing campaign to win new customers. During the year 72,981
companies were added as new customers of Banco Sabadell, a
number that was 31.4% up on the previous year's figure. In the
third quarter the SME and large corporate business segments saw
their shares in the division’s overall total reach unprecedented
heights, rising by 8.1% for both customer groups. Especially
noteworthy was the large corporate segment’s share in the total,
which rose to 70.6%, a clear sign of the added value afforded by
the possession of a network of dedicated business branches
which at the end of the year consisted of 71 branches covering
every part the country.

In the business customer segment, acquisition levels were
highly significant and increased the share of this customer group
by 6.5% compared with the previous year. A key element in new
business generation was the "Expansién Negocios" account,

a specially targeted product that was launched in 2010 and

remains fully competitive in terms of both services and cost and
is consequently highly effective as a marketing aid. To make
the management of this large number of new customers more
cost-effective, a customer education programme was put in hand
with the aim of helping customers to develop their multi-channel
abilities and thus enabling them to have more of their commonest
banking needs serviced remotely.

In its approach to public sector customers, the group finalized
a plan for engaging with the public sector which resulted in the
formation of a team of dedicated managers covering all parts
of the country. In 2012 positive results were achieved across
a range of business metrics including increases in customer
numbers and customer funds, which were up by 33.7% and
36.5% respectively compared with the previous year. Another
noteworthy aspect was Banco Sabadell's active participation in
mechanisms set up by the Spanish Government to finance the
country's regional governments and manage their payments
to suppliers: the Regional Liquidity Fund and the Fund for the
Financing of Payments to Suppliers.

All through 2012 the group waged an intense promotional
effort whose primary focus was on attracting deposits and
other funds. The success of this campaign meant that, despite
fierce competition within the banking industry and the prevailing
economic climate, customer funds grew by 9.6% year-on-year,
rising by €1,805.8 million in absolute terms. Key contributors to
this growth were commercial paper (pagarés) and term deposits,
especially the "Lider" 12-month deposit. Key products in the drive
to promote customer loyalty and increase cross-sale ratios were
business and store protection policies, with take-up rates rising by
29.6% compared with the previous year. In working capital finance
the group decided to anticipate new SEPA regulations due to come
into effect in 2014 by introducing two new products, B2B and Core
Direct Debits, which provide further safeguards for customers in
their business transactions. For another year more specialized
forms of financing such as factoring and "confirming" (discounted
payments of invoices presented by a customer's named suppliers),
particularly in cross-border transactions, provided customers with
additional solutions for their global collections and payments.

One area deserving of special mention is the group's firm
commitment to e-commerce. During the year a special unit
was set up to be a source of expertise with a mission to drive
innovation and give advice and support to business customers
entering the world of online selling.

Support of another kind was offered to customers in the
form of solutions to help them meet their funding and liquidity
requirements. During the year numerous agreements were made
with official agencies at central government and regional level,
under which the Bank was able to provide a total of €1,565.0
million in loan finance. A very similar area of business that
generated much activity during the year was the provision of
finance to businesses and sole traders under Official Credit
Institute-sponsored schemes, in which the Bank achieved a 12.2%
share, putting it in third place among participating banks and
improving its ranking by two notches compared with the previous
year. The ICO funding schemes with the highest take-up were ICO
Liquidez and ICO Inversion, with disbursements totalling €752.3
million and €557.8 million respectively. The Bank was also the


--- Page 36 ---

€'000

top provider of finance under the ICO Exportadores, ICO Garantia
SGR and ICO Emprendedores funding schemes, in which its shares
were 88.0%, 35.7% and 31.9% respectively.

The Bank also continued to work tirelessly to promote
international trade and offer guidance to businesses. As part of
this effort it organized a series of foreign trade seminars that were
attended by over 2,100 firms. The "Exportar para crecer" [Export
to grow] programme, an innovative combination of products and
training events designed to meet customers’ exporting needs, was
launched during the year. Activities of this kind confirmed Banco
Sabadell's position as a key supplier of services for foreign trade,
both to existing and potential customers. An indication of this was
the growth in its share of the export and import documentary credit
businesses compared with 2011, with year-end market shares of
24.3% and 14.1% respectively.

In 2012 Banco Sabadell was once again a leading provider of
medium- and long-term finance, especially in the areas of leasing,
sale-and-leaseback, marine finance and finance for expansion
and renewing plant and equipment. One indication of this was an
18.0% rise in the group's plant and equipment leasing business
with its focus on energy-efficiency, in which it was a major market
player. In the area of leasing, the launch of a special product for
franchises to help franchisees obtain access to credit was a
noteworthy development.

The last month of the year saw a further progress in
implementing the group’s policy of focusing on particular market
segments, with two highly targeted sales teams being set up:
one dedicated to businesses in market segments related to
the tourist/holiday industry, and one focused exclusively on
institutional clients.

Individual customers

The year 2012 was of special significance for the Bank's goal, as
set out in its current 3-year strategic plan, of perfecting its growth
strategy for the individual customer segment. Record figures for
customer growth were achieved for the second year in succession
as new customers reached a total of more than 338,800, an
increase of 18.2% on the figure for 2011. At the same time, the full
integration of the Banco CAM group, the market leader in serving
the needs of individual customers in the regions of Valencia and
Murcia, resulted in Banco CAM’s two million-strong customer base
being transferred to Banco Sabadell.

Another factor of critical importance in 2012 in attaining the
group's strategic goals of winning new customers and deepening
customer relationships was a major promotional effort across the
entire branch network; this was organized around a combination of
three pivotal themes: profile-raising actions, competitive products
and service quality.

Actions to raise the group's profile took the form of
investment in advertising campaigns in which the main emphasis
was on transmitting the group's values as a basis for building
long-term relationships.

In 2012 it was once again the "Cuenta Expansi6n" account
that had the star role in the Bank’s product offering and provided a
keynote for campaigns to generate new business and transaction
activity from a more sophisticated customer. Cuenta Expansion, a
product strongly promoted at branch level and well established in
the marketplace, proved once again to be highly competitive.

Finally and no less importantly, the group's determination to
grow without compromising its high standards of customer service
ensured that Banco Sabadell scored the lowest customer attrition
rate of any bank in 2012 (according to research by FRS Inmark
on the banking habits of the general public in Spain), despite
substantial increases in customer numbers.

A key event in the group's promotional efforts directed at the
personal banking (non-mass market) customer segment in 2012
was the launch of the "Cuenta Expansion Premium" account,
supplementing the standard Cuenta Expansion product with a
range of exclusive features for the personal banking customer.
At the same time, efforts to attract new funds to strengthen the
balance sheet were rewarded with a 4.7% increase in funding
from customers over the year.

For middle-income customers the “Cuenta Expansi6n”
provided the main hook on which to hang promotional activities
aimed at winning and retaining new customers looking for a
solution to their day-to-day banking needs. By the close of the
year 173,870 new accounts of this type had been opened, with
direct debit bill payments showing a 9.3% rise as of November.
Meanwhile, promotional campaigns aimed at growing on-
balance sheet funds succeeded in attracting a total of
€20,330.4 million in new funding by the end of the year, a figure
that was 17.8% higher than the year before.

In mortgage finance, a large part of the group's business
consisted of mortgage loans for purchases of properties owned
by the Bank or whose development it had financed. In 2012 these
loans accounted for 44.7% of the aggregate value of mortgage
loans granted, well above the 26.7% they represented in 2011.
The group's share of new home loans arranged during the year
increased by 57.2% (as of September), to 3.7%, compared with the
2.3% the year before.

In a context of lower consumer spending by households, the
group saw an increase in its short-term lending compared with
the previous year. This was driven partly by growth in the number
of drawdowns on pre-arranged overdraft facilities via online or
other remote channels, and partly by increased use of the "Linea
Expansion", a facility designed to provide cash advances to
households to fund day-to-day spending needs. The Bank also
continued to be a leading provider of funding for courses of study
at business schools such as IESE, ESADE or IE, a group which was


--- Page 38 ---

€'000

joined by EADA, LaSalle, AGAUR-ICF and other business schools
during the year.

The group's credit card business also saw significant growth,
with revenue increasing by 20.0% and the number of cards in use
by 63.0%, including figures for Banco CAM. The Bank’s share of the
EPOS market was up by 22.5% on the previous year, reaching 8.6%
by the end of 2012.

Anotable development in the group's services targeted at
Spain’s resident expatriate community, offered mainly through
the SabadellSolbank branches, was the success of the “Regular
Transfer Plan” exclusively for UK citizens who make up 43% of the
group’s foreign customers. The plan was launched in 2012 and is
designed to make it easier for British expatriates to have regular
automatic transfers sent from the UK to their accounts in Spain
without having to make special arrangements with their UK bank.
The strong take-up of the service among UK customers resulted in
a 473.8% increase in net income from the service compared with
2011. The number of customers in this market segment reached
a year-end total of 243,000, with assets under management in
excess of €5,009.7 million.

Finally ActivoBank, with more than 55,000 customers at the
close of the year, continued to focus on wealth management,
generating business volumes of more than €1,597.6 million. Its
key priority continued to be growing its balance sheet funds, which
were up 16.3% on 2011.

Banco Herrero

Banco Herrero saw its customer base increase by 32,361 in 2012,
a sign of the trust enjoyed by the brand within its regional market of
Asturias and Leon, as well as the popularity of its product offering
and the effectiveness of its branch sales personnel. Of these new
customers 28,571 were individuals and 3,790 were businesses,
confirming Banco Herrero's position as a key player within its
Asturias and Le6n base.

The rise in customers immediately translated into business
growth and boosted the inflow of funding which grew by more than
for all other competitors within the territory served by the Herrero
brand, rising by €588.1 million to a year-end total of €7,145.2
million, 9.0% more than at the end of 2011. This was helped by the
boost to confidence given to all the group’s customers on seeing
it being classed as one of the most resilient Spanish banks with
sufficient capital to outride the most adverse macroeconomic

scenarios, as was demonstrated by independent audits carried out
on Spain's leading financial institutions.

Aclear indication of Banco Sabadell's position as a key provider
of finance for business ventures is the active part it has played in
|CO-subsidized funding schemes in Asturias and Leon in the last few
years. In 2012 Banco Herrero was responsible for 35% and 20%,
within Asturias and Leén respectively, of the total amount made
available under the ICO scheme by all participating banks combined.
In some schemes, entrepreneur finance for example, Banco Herrero
saw its share rise to as much as 65% for Asturias and 24% for
Le6n. The group's aim of bringing financing solutions to businesses
was furthered by agreements made during the year with the
Asturian Enterprise Federation (FADE) and the Leon Entrepreneurs’
Federation (FELE). These resulted in the "Impulso" scheme under
which funds amounting to €300 million were released to support
business entrepreneurship in Asturias and Le6n.

Vigilance in the selection and monitoring of loans was once
again a key priority and the loan loss ratio, which stood at 3.8% at
the end of the year, was one of the lowest for the Spanish banking
industry as a whole.

Banco Herrero received awards which, for another year,
showed the high levels of appreciation and satisfaction with the
brand among customers and the wider community in Asturias
Leon. These included the Medal of Honour awarded by the
Humanitarios de San Martin, a local philanthropic organization,
and the Golden Apple prize from the Asturian Centre in Madrid.
Celebrations held in honour of the brand’s centenary were
brought to a brilliant climax at a recital given by soprano singer
Ainhoa Arteta at the Principe Felipe hall in Oviedo, before an
invited audience of 1,500 customers.

A significant event in 2012 was the second year of the
Alvarez-Margaride prize, the result of a joint initiative by Banco
Herrero and the APQ (Asturias Patria Querida) Association. The
prize is awarded to people, firms or organizations whose activities
show a long-standing connection with the Asturias region. On this
occasion the prize was won by Placido Arango Arias, an Asturian-
Mexican businessman.

Other activities in the cultural and social spheres included four
new exhibitions at the Banco Herrero Hall in Oviedo, organized
as part of an agreement between the bank and the Asturian
Government's Department of Culture. Each year the Banco Herrero
Foundation awards a prize to an economist below the age of 40
judged to have done outstanding work in the economic, business
or social arenas. This year the award went to Emilio J. Castilla, a
Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor whose research
field is meritocracy and human relations within corporations.

SabadellGuipuzcoano

May 2012 saw the merger and integration of Banco Guipuzcoano
within the Banco Sabadell group following the merger of the former
into the latter. As a result, all branches serving Guipuzcoano’s

home territory of the Basque Country, Navarre and La Rioja are now
operating under the SabadellGuipuzcoano name only. Responsibility
for managing these branches lies entirely with the group's Northern
Division in the Basque Country. As the single brand bedded in, a


--- Page 40 ---

rationalization plan for the Bank's branches in the region was put in
hand to merge two networks that had so far operated side-by-side,
with branches sharing a single location in many cases. A total of 42
branches were affected by the reorganization, which reduced this
number through mergers to a final 21.

The plan led to further reorganization of regional branches under
the SabadellGuipuzcoano umbrella. Subsequently another eight
branches, this time from the former Banco CAM network in the region,
were integrated, again as a result of mergers. The changes brought
the SabadellGuipuzcoano network to its current total of 129 branches
serving more than 125,000 customers and handling an overall
volume of business that accounts for approximately 6% of the total
business of the Banco Sabadell group.

The reorganization was accompanied by the introduction and
rolling out of Banco Sabadell management and business processes
and systems to all branches of the former Banco Guipuzcoano,
resulting in very substantial increases in new customer numbers
and in lending and deposit taking. Given the strategic importance
that customer service has for the Banco Sabadell group, the speed
with which the group's policies on quality were adopted by these
reorganized branches was nothing short of remarkable: as early
as the second quarter, they had already attained the same high
standards and quality indicators as the rest of the organization.

Another factor which has undoubtedly cemented links with
the local community in the region has been a sustained effort in
external communication and sponsorship, which has succeeded
in giving the Bank, and especially the SabadellGuipuzcoano brand,
a high degree of visibility and recognition. There is, in fact, a clear
perception in the market that SabadellGuipuzcoano combines the
strength of Banco Sabadell, as one of Spain's top-line banking
organizations, with the closeness and dedication to the local
market represented by the Banco Guipuzcoano brand identity.

Community-based actions in 2012 were numerous and
sustained and included cultural, social, business and sporting
events within the region. Business-related actions, for example,
included sponsoring a "Basque enterprise evening" which
underscored the Bank's commitment to Basque industry and
commerce, and the Guiptizcoa Chamber of Commerce trade
prizes. In the cultural domain, the Bank continued to support major
events such as the San Sebastian Music Festival, the Kursaal
Foundation's concert season and the International Gastronomy
Fair, also held in Guiptizcoa's main city of San Sebastian. Finally,
the Bank increased its sponsorship of local sporting events, the
most important of which was undoubtedly the Basque Country
Tour cycle race, a long-established, high-level competition. That
the event was able to continue this year was only possible thanks
to a last-minute agreement by the Bank to act as a sponsor, thus
assuring it of an enormous media impact.

SabadellCAM

For a large part of the year Banco Sabadell was engaged in the
challenging task of integrating Banco CAM without any loss of
focus on business priorities. On completion of the process in June
2012 and without waiting for full systems integration, the Bank
set in motion an action plan to relaunch Banco CAM as a business

sossoujsng dno

ZTOz Woday jenuuy jjepeqes ooueg

51


--- Page 41 ---

sossoujsng dno

ZTOz Woday jenuuy jjepeqes ooueg

52

with the aim of returning to the volume of deposits it had had in the
past and rebuilding confidence among its customers.

The actions put in hand to bring about the successful relaunch
were carried out in three areas or stages. The first of these was to
set up a new sales/marketing organization and bring in the former
Banco CAM sales team to staff it. The team's offices were reassigned
among the group's Commercial Banking regional divisions. Within
the SabadellCAM regional division (covering the area served by the
former Banco CAM), four area units were set up to manage the large
number of customers and branches in that region. In this phase of
the restructuring programme, two landmark events are particularly
worthy of mention. First, conferences were held in Alicante and Sant
Cugat del Vallés for 1,200 and 400 delegates respectively, at which
attendees were given presentations on the integration and the shared
enterprise on which they were about to embark.

The second key event in that first phase was an offer to Banco
CAM customers to exchange their holdings of preferred and
subordinated debt, which was rewarded with a 95% acceptance
by customers. This was the first major success in the take-over
project and demonstrated the capabilities of the Banco CAM sales
team, now fully integrated within the group.

In June a media campaign on the revitalized Banco CAM was
launched under the slogan “Aqui nos tienes, de nuevo” [“Here we
are again” ], with the clear objective of restoring Banco CAM to its
past eminence and rebuilding trust among its customers.

The aim behind the new SabadellCAM brand was to combine
Banco Sabadell's brand values with the wide recognition enjoyed
by Banco CAM within its traditional area of influence. This meant
retaining the differentiated identity of the Banco CAM brand and
perfectly fitted the group's multi-brand strategy. SabadellCAM is
now the principal name under which the group will operate in the
regions of Valencia and Murcia (along with the SabadellSolbank
branches in the main resort/expatriate areas).

Channels

Banco Sabadell is an industry leader in harnessing technology to
bring financial services to its customers. More and more customers
are talking about the Bank in blogs and on social networking sites,
where they can perform multiple interactions with a single click.
Moreover, customers can connect to networks anytime, anywhere.
They can move freely from one channel to another; at the same
time, there is no reason why the completion of any particular stage
in signing up for a product should take place on a particular channel.
For customers, therefore, it is vital that these different channels
(branch, online banking, smartphone, etc,) should be able to interact
with each other and respond to customers’ enquiries or needs in
a totally seamless way. Banco Sabadell is continually improving its
way of interacting with customers and broadening its range of multi-
channel services by adding convenient financial solutions, while
preserving the essence of its value proposition: quality of service.
Banco Sabadell’s ambition is to let customers experience a
new way of doing banking that not only embodies everything that
the new technologies have to offer but also, for those already using
them on a daily basis, avoids creating any distance or remoteness
between customer and bank.


--- Page 42 ---

Banco Sabadell is also working to enhance the day-to-day
experience of customers using these new channels and to make
the new channels work better with the traditional ones. The Bank's
aim is to convert its branches into a multi-channel network so that
employees and customers can interact in different ways; at the
same time, it is making banking easier and simpler, so that service
is what really makes the difference.

Branch network

Banco Sabadell ended the year with a total of 1,898 branches. Of
these, 901 were operating under the SabadellAtlantico name; 523
were trading under the SabadellCAM name in Valencia and Murcia;
179 made up the Banco Herrero network in Asturias and Le6n;
128 were SabadellGuipuzcoano branches in the Basque Country,
Navarre and La Rioja; 106 were SabadellSolbank branches,

12 were SabadellUrquijo, 2 were Corporate Banking branches

and 2 were ActivoBank customer service centres. The group's
international network comprised a further 45 offices.

Occupational groups and agent partners

Banking services targeted on professional and occupational
groupings and the use of agent partners and associates

continued to play a key role in winning customers in 2012, whether
individuals, retail establishments or professional practices. At the
close of the year a total of 1,625 partnership agreements were

in existence with professional associations and colleges with a
combined membership of over 1,309,126, of whom 358,960 were


--- Page 44 ---

already customers of the Bank. The business volumes associated
with this market amounted to more than €13,000 million.

Of particular significance was the signing up of 65,000
employees and senior managers of companies that were business
customers of the Bank, as well as more than 66,500 new
customers from the professions.

Banco Sabadell’s network of agent partners, particularly in the
role of “collaborating agent”, was once again a key channel for
winning new business. New customer introductions amounted to
over 18,000 at the end of the year. A noticeable tendency in 2012
was the increasing number of financial advisory firms ("EAFIS")
and financial agents joining the Bank's network of agent partners.

ATM network

In the course of the year a total of 89 million transactions (24.5
million of them on Banco Sabadell ATMs and 64.5 million on
SabadellCAM machines) were done on the group's network of
3,166 self-service cash machines.

The group continued the ATM modernization programme it
began in 2009. This included replacing a total of 294 machines
and installing another 8 mini cash machines for updating bank
books only; of these the group now has a total of 337 (including
329 belonging to the SabadellCAM network).

Work also continued to ensure maximum operational
availability of ATMs, including adjustments to monitoring systems
to trigger warning signals and remedial actions in the event of a

loss of communication. Measures were also taken to ensure that
machines were dispensing cash at all times.

Improvements were made to user help screens for the most
frequent types of transaction (cash withdrawals, updating bank
books and account balance enquiries) and five new screen
languages were added: Valencian, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish and
Norwegian (plus Russian and Arabic on Banco CAM machines).

The performance of ATMs was also upgraded with the addition
of new functionality for paying taxes and utility bills using barcode
readers and payments with debit or credit cards. A new "Instant
Money" service, which allows users to withdraw money without a
card, was also introduced.

Remote access channels

BS Online

At the end of 2012 more than 1,950,000 individual customers and
385,000 businesses had signed up for the group's online banking
service. The overall figure (which includes Banco CAM) was more
than 59% up on the year before. A total of 482 million transactions
were performed online, an annual increase of 37%.

The internetization rate (i.e. the number of transactions
done online as a proportion of the total), at 84.4%, showed a
considerable improvement compared with the previous year’s 81%,
and BS Online continued to contribute to improving the efficiency of
the Bank's service to its customers.

In service availability, BS Online was again among the four best
online banking services according to metrics produced by Eurobits,
the specialist online banking monitoring organization.

The year saw further action to improve security and fraud
prevention, including a new system for signing e-commerce
transactions and an expanded system for requesting a second
personal detail on a mobile phone when using online banking.
Work was also done to make transfers more user-friendly and to
simplify the viewing and sending of files of orders in business-to-
business transactions.

During the year work started on integrating the websites of
SabadellSolbank and SabadellGuipuzcoano into the main Sabadell
site, in line with group policy.

Banking on the move - BS Movil

The BS Movil mobile phone banking portal showed impressive
growth in the number of active users in 2012, ending the year with
a total of 360,900 users, an 182% increase. At the close of the
year more than 27% of active users of online banking were also
using their mobile phones to access the service.

The number of users of the SMS alerts service increased by
94%. SMS messages were received by more than 1,448,000 users
on their mobile phones and more than 27.4 million messages were
sent, an increase of 44% on the number sent the previous year.

In 2012 the Bank continued its strategy of developing
capabilities in native applications for phone terminals and tablets
running on key platforms such as iPhone, iPad, Android, BlackBerry
and Windows Phone.

This was accompanied by a massive expansion in the number of
new functions available on BS Movil. These included paying credit


--- Page 46 ---

card bills in instalments, loan repayments, cashback on bills paid
by direct debit, changes in personal details, regular payments into
pension and retirement plans, etc. Special facilities for business
users was also added, such as single and multiple signatures to
authorize transactions and applications to open an account with the
bank or sign up for online banking by mobile phone.

Branch Direct

The year 2012 saw further changes to Branch Direct to give ita
more sales-oriented role. Its focus will be from now on acquiring
new customers, signing up customers for remote banking services,
dealing with customer enquiries and building customer loyalty
across a variety of communication channels (telephone, e-mail,
social networking sites, etc.).

During the year Branch Direct received and handled more than
1,630,000 enquiries, 31% more than in the previous year. The
telephone helpline achieved a service level (calls answered as a
proportion of calls received) of 95.8% and a response rate (calls
answered in less than 20 seconds) of 80%.

Another innovation was the launch of a telephone banking
service for business users and, as the integration of Banco CAM
came to completion, the group-wide implementation of the Branch
Direct service model (24/7 availability, one-number access,
proactive contact with customers, etc.).

Social networking sites

During the year Banco Sabadell continued to make use of social
networking sites as 24-hour-a-day servicing and communication
channels.

This year @BancoSabadell, the only financial services company
in Spain with a verified Twitter account, completed its fifth year as
a Twitter user and ended the year with more than 40,000 followers.
on the social networking sites where it has a presence.

Use was made of the sites to provide ongoing support for sales
campaigns and media events such as the Open Banc Sabadell
tennis tournament and the group's “Seny”, “Relaciones” and
“Valores" campaigns.

2012 also saw the launch of a new Banco Sabadell Internet
television channel, bancosabadell.tv, offering a wide variety
of video content featuring news and features related to the
organization. It also joined a new social networking site, www.
pinterest.com/bancosabadell.

Banco Sabadell’s presence on the main social networking sites
can be viewed on socialmedia.bancsabadell.com.

Promotional campaigns

In 2012, as part of the Bank's strategic objective of winning new
customers and deepening customer relationships and to support
its marketing efforts, a number of advertising campaigns were
undertaken.

General profile-raising actions included a continuing campaign
on the theme of "conversations" —which garnered numerous
advertising industry awards in the course of the year— and the
launch of "Values", a campaign highlighting the attributes of trust,
truthfulness and communication as vital elements in building

lasting relationships with customers. These general themes were
reinforced by promotional initiatives run in particular areas or
regions. One of these was a campaign targeted on SabadellCAM's
home territory of Valencia and Murcia, where its "Here we are
again" slogan transmitted a powerful message of optimism.
Another campaign, confined to Catalonia and themed on the
Catalan word "seny" (shrewd good sense), featured celebrities
from different walks of life explaining what the word meant to
them. No less successful, and the ultimate example of locally
focused marketing, was a campaign celebrating the Catalan town
of Sabadell in 2012, Banco Sabadell’s 130th anniversary year. The
principal campaign event, a flashmob performance of Beethoven's
Ode to Joy, found its way into the top 20 viral ads for 2012.

—Corporate Banking and Global Businesses in 2012

Corporate Banking

Banco Sabadell was again one of the foremost banks actively
addressing this market segment, for which the loan loss ratio is
just 1.1%. Since these major corporate clients export a relatively
large share of their output and are therefore less exposed to local
business cycle and market conditions, activity in this segment
continued at a high level and enabled us to keep our business
growing in step with our clients. Thanks to the resilience of this
market segment, Corporate Banking was able to end the year with
a 19.1% rise in operating income, sufficient to absorb the increase
in provision charges compared with the previous year, which ended
with a net provision release. All this helped Corporate Banking to
keep its ROE for 2012 in double digits (14.1%).

—Strong revenue growth
—We opened an office in New York

In purely business terms, our key priorities continued to be
strengthening customer relationships and boosting income from fee-
earning services with lower capital usage, while continuing to apply
the same rigorous standards to the approval and renewal of loans.
Towards the end of the year a design was produced
for a restructured Corporate Banking division based on a
prior segmentation exercise. This will ensure that business
development and risk approval policies are more closely aligned
with the needs of each customer segment and more targeted on
core customers. The exercise will be carried out in coordination
with our Corporate Banking teams in Spain (Madrid and Barcelona)
along with those in Paris, London and Miami.

* Figures for 2012 include performance data for Banco CAM from June onwards.

Structured Finance

Banco Sabadell is one of Spain's foremost providers of structured
financing solutions and lead-managed many of the deals carried
out in Spain during the year, whether in the area of project finance,
corporate finance or acquisitions.

The organization has shown a remarkable capacity for
innovation and adapting to new circumstances in all markets and
product areas, and has constantly sought new financing solutions
for its customers.

A major event in 2012 was the launch of the Bank's
representative office in New York which, along with its Miami office
and its Sabadell United subsidiary, represents a further milestone
in the Banco Sabadell Americas project and confirms its role as
a market leader in loan syndications, especially in the renewable
energy field.

The acquisition of Banco CAM led to a significant increase in
structured finance deals, with a sizeable expansion in the number
of transactions involving other European countries.

Corporate Finance

In its capacity as an advisor of mergers and acquisitions, during
the year Banco Sabadell successfully completed six transactions
in the telecommunications engineering, motor vehicle component,
audiovisual services, mass-market packaging and renewable

‘sossousng dnoig

60

energy sectors. In two cases the transaction was international
in character and involved advising Spanish companies on the
acquisition of a foreign target. Another comprised the first take-
over offer for a company quoted on MAB, Spain's alternative
market for smaller companies, establishing the Bank as a major
player in finance deals of this type.

Development capital

Aurica XXI, S.C.R., S.A.

Aurica XXI (a company subject to the “simplified regime” for share
issues by venture capital companies) is the vehicle through which
Banco Sabadell supports the growth of well-managed non-financial
companies with strong, industry-leading positions and a good
presence in foreign markets, by providing short-term capital and
active assistance.

The year 2012 was a time for consolidation and for beginning
the process of divesting Aurica's existing equity portfolio, including
ComsaEmte.

Sinia Renovables, SCR, S.A.

Through its subsidiary Sinia Renovables (a company subject to the
“simplified regime” for share issues by venture capital companies),
Banco Sabadell takes temporary shareholdings in companies in
the renewable energy sector. The company also does investment
research in other renewable sources for electricity generation such
as solar, photovoltaic, CHP or mini-hydraulic power generation and
wind farm projects.

The year 2012 saw the commissioning of wind farms acquired the
year before while still under construction or at the development stage.
Energy production commenced at wind farms at Mirasierra (Palencia),
Sierra Sesndndez (Zamora) and Loma del Cap6n (Granada).

International trade

For the Bank's international trade business 2012 was another very
busy year, thanks in part to the growth in exporting. Transactions
were directly arranged with more than 252 correspondent banks

in five continents. The group secured cross-border business
amounting to some €1,545 million, retaining healthy market
shares in documentary credits received from its correspondent
banks, with shares of 16.2% in import documentation and 24.3%
in export documentary credits based on data for transactions
handled by SWIFT, with the share of documentary credits showing
an 84 basis point rise since the end of 2011.

The Bank's international branches continued to focus on, and
adapt their services for, markets of special interest to Spanish
companies actively engaging in foreign trade, whether in the
import/export field or as part of their foreign investment activities.
During the year the Polish office of the former Banco CAM was
absorbed into the Banco Sabadell international trade organization.


--- Page 50 ---

The Bank's Casablanca branch, the first to be opened by
a Spanish bank in Morocco, met all the targets set for it, thus
continuing the solid progress the branch has made since its
launch. It is ideally positioned to assist Moroccan businesses with
share-owning interests or trading links in Spain by providing them
with transaction banking and financial solutions of the first order.

Banco Sabadell has long been a pioneer in building a presence
in foreign markets. This is especially true of such key markets as
China (where it has three offices), India, Singapore, Turkey, the
United Arab Emirates and Algeria. Its foreign branches and offices
continue to bring significant added value to the international
operations of Spanish businesses.

Consumer finance: BanSabadell Fincom

Business activity at BanSabadell Fincom continued to expand in
2012, with increases over previous years in both net revenue and
operating income, the latter rising by as much as 12%.

It also made further progress in improving efficiency in
recovering debts, thus reducing loan delinquencies and ensuring
that 100% of doubtful loans were provided for.

During the year a total of 55,000 new loans were arranged
through 4,000 points of sale in all parts of the country. This new
business resulted in top-line revenues for 2012 of €257 million.

The company continued to deliver efficiency improvements
thanks to highly skilled personnel, upgraded technology tools, and
success in managing down operating costs. All this helped the
company to bring its cost:income ratio down to below 33%.

—Markets and Private Banking in 2012

SabadellUrquijo Banca Privada

A major milestone during the year 2012 was the integration of
Banco Urquijo into Sabadell Banca Privada under a single brand
name: “SabadellUrquijo Banca Privada”. Combining these two
business models has produced customer service benefits,
whether in the form of accessibility via the Banco Sabadell
branch network or through the specialist private banking branch
relationship, thus assuring customers of a totally personalized
approach across the full range of private banking services.

These changes, of a highly strategic nature, considerably
boosted Banco Sabadell's business effectiveness by
strengthening its position as a key player in serving high net-worth
individuals and managing large fortunes, as well as through the
synergies released by a simpler, leaner organizational structure.

The customer service team comprised 175 private bankers
working from 12 specialist private banking offices and 23
customer service centres located in 11 of the country's regions.
The office team was supplemented and supported by experts to
advise on investment, tax and wealth planning, so that customers

could be sure of tapping a wide range of expertise according to
their individual requirements.

The acquisition of Banco CAM in June 2012 resulted in the
private banking business of that organization being merged during
the year. The result was the addition of a professionally qualified
staff of 17 with a background in sales, business volumes of
€1,927 million and 3,800 customers.

The focus on specialization led to exclusive service offerings
being developed for specific customer segments such as
prominent people from the worlds of Sport and Entertainment
and Religious Organizations, or in business areas such as
company pension/retirement plans, with a considerable impact
on customers’ perceptions. Another new development was the
launch of Excellence, a programme whose aim is to systematize
the servicing of ultra-high net-worth clients and provide them with a
differentiated service tailored to their needs.

Top-line revenues for SabadellUrquijo were €25,378 million,
with a pre-tax profit of €12,686 million; the unit served a total of
28,749 customers.

For the unit 2012 was a year of consolidation in terms of
strategic positioning, brand profile and public image, providing a
platform from which the Markets and Private Banking team can
tackle the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

Investment, Products and Research

Banco Sabadell continued to focus on financial market analysis
and research to identify the right asset allocation strategies to


--- Page 52 ---

guide investment and product planning. The year 2012 saw a major
effort to ensure customers were provided with ample information
on key market developments, investment views and product
recommendations using a variety of new formats and channels.

The difficult macroeconomic environment generated
opportunities for investment in the financial markets that were
utilized to take positions in a range of investment instruments,
launch new capital growth and guaranteed return products, and
make direct recommendations to investors. These opportunities
included the high returns available on Spanish government debt
caused by uncertainty over the euro, excellent returns on corporate
bonds and attractive earnings from higher risk assets as risk
premiums gradually declined after the summer.

During the year the investment analysis unit continued
to strengthen its advisory services, whether in stock market
investments or in private sector debt. One consequence of this was
a yet wider coverage in its range of market strategy reports focusing
on sectors and geographic regions, companies quoted on the main
Spanish and European bourses and corporate bonds or securities
issued by central or regional government or other official agencies.

The group’s Investment Management business is carried on by
the units responsible for managing collective investment schemes
(CIS's), and combines investment management with the distribution
and operation of CIS's. It also manages investments on behalf other
Banco Sabadell businesses that hold portfolios of assets.

At the close of 2012 total assets under management by the
Spanish-domiciled mutual fund industry as a whole, including real
estate investment funds, totalled €126,529.6 million, 4.3% below
the figure for the year before. Net redemptions registered in 2012 by
mutual funds investing in financial assets totalled €10,273.8 million.

The volume of assets held in Spanish-domiciled mutual funds
under management by the Banco Sabadell group amounted to
€5,423.5 million at the close of the year. This was 4.4% above the
figure for the previous year and included the mutual funds added
as a result of the integration of Banco CAM.

The group’s offering of guaranteed return funds continued to
be very actively promoted during the year and return guarantees
were issued in respect of six guaranteed funds totalling €616.1
million at 31 December 2012. Guaranteed funds as a whole
accounted for €2,370.8 million worth of assets at the close
of the year. The proportion of assets held in guaranteed funds
increased relative to the total value of financial assets under
management in funds subject to Spanish jurisdiction, rising to
53.4% from 48.3% the year before.

Sabadell BS Inmobiliario Fil, a real estate fund launched in
early 2004, ended the year with assets of €980.2 million and
17,163 fundholders, the latter increasing by 4.7% on the previous
year. The fund remains an industry leader for collective investment
in real estate assets on the Spanish market.

In 2012 Banco Sabadell mutual funds earned a number
of accolades and distinctions. Five mutual funds managed
by Sabadell Inversion were reviewed and had their Silver fund
gradings confirmed by mutual fund rating agency and analysts
Standard and Poor's Capital IQ Fund Research. Four of the funds
were also awarded the coveted Five-Year Long Term Grading
for consistently high returns over the last five years. Sabadell
Inversion is the only fund manager subject to Spanish jurisdiction
that can boast a high quality grading from Standard & Poor's
Capital IQ Fund Research.

During the year a total of 23 mutual funds and three
investment companies (OEICs) were added to the range of
investment vehicles as a result of the merger of Banco CAM.
There were 10 mergers in which 11 funds were absorbed by
others with the same investment objectives, having regard always
to investors' best interests. One OEIC was also merged. Two
fixed-return guaranteed funds were set up and registered with the
securities market regulator (CNMV). By the end of the year the
number of Spanish-jurisdiction collective investment schemes
stood at 269 with management split between BanSabadell
Inversion, S.A., S.G.1.1.C. Sociedad Unipersonal (101 mutual
funds, one real estate fund and one OEIC) and Urquijo Gestion,
S.A., S.G.I.1.C. Sociedad Unipersonal (166 OEICs or SICAVs).

Treasury and Capital Markets

In 2012, despite the prevailing difficult economic climate good
levels of activity were maintained and ensured that financial
targets were met. Low interest rates and reduced needs for long-
term financing, combined with increasing export activity by our
customers, led to changes in the product mix, with currency and
exchange rate management products experiencing rising demand
at the expense of hedging and structured investment products. In
2012, as in the year before, a significant contribution was made
by fixed-income products, especially securities designed for retail
investors. These included securities issued by the group itself.
Banco Sabadell was able to continue raising funds in the
capital markets, even though the bond markets remained
inaccessible for long periods of time to a majority of Spanish
issuers. As an issuer in the primary fixed-income market, however,
Banco Sabadell not only further strengthened its position as a lead
manager of issues for the wholesale and retail markets, but also


--- Page 54 ---

participated in buyback offers for securitization and subordinated
debt issues.

The group’s market trading activities included notable
successes in portfolio management, despite movements in the
spreads on peripheral European debt; at the same time it was
deeply engaged in liquidity management in view of the shut-down
in capital market issuances. However, 2012 was also a year of
consolidation and reduced dependence on external sources in
the generation of financial products.

Bancassurance

—Bancassurance — a dependable, growing business

At 31 December 2012, the total volume of savings under
management by Bancassurance was €8,537.9 million. Issued
premiums totalling €774.8 million.

As a result of the 2012 merger of Banco CAM, Banco
Sabadell's insurance and pensions business is structured into
three joint ventures:

—BanSabadell Vida, BanSabadell Pensiones and BanSabadell
Seguros Generales, which since 2008 have been operating as
joint ventures in partnership with the Zurich insurance group.

—Mediterrdneo Vida, in partnership with the Aegon insurance
group.

—NMediterraneo Seguros Diversos, in partnership with Caser.

Another undertaking, Mediterraneo Mediaci6n, distributes
insurance written by the former Banco CAM.

Bancassurance made a profit before distribution
commissions, exceptional items and taxes of €164.1 million and
a net profit of €62.3 million.

BanSabadell Vida

Total premium income in life insurance for the year 2012 was
€551.2 million, placing BanSabadell Vida in ninth position in
the league table of Spanish life offices according to recent data
published by ICEA, a research organization for the insurance and
pension industries.

In protection-only life insurance, premium income totalled
€95.5 million, up 6% on the year-end figure for 2011. With
demand for mortgage payment protection policies continuing to
decline, positive trends included new high-selling offerings for
businesses and the growth in the Life Care range of free-standing
life policies, which generated €38.6 in premium income, an
annual increase of 21%.

BanSabadell Vida savings/life insurance products ended the
year with total savings under management of €5,555.0 million.

This ranks BanSabadell Vida as the Spanish life industry's 11th
largest provider according to recent data from ICEA.

BanSabadell Vida posted a profit before sale commissions,
exceptional items and taxes of €127.9 million. The net profit
€53.3 million.

BanSabadell Pensiones

Funds under management by BanSabadell Pensiones reached
a year-end total of €2,679.1 million. Of these funds, €1,681.1
million related to individual and group pension plans —up by 12%
on 2011— and €998.0 million originated from company schemes.
These totals rank BanSabadell Pensiones in tenth place in
the industry as a whole according to recent data from Inverco, an
investment and pension fund association.
BanSabadell Pensiones posted a profit before commissions and
tax of €17.9 million. The net profit for the year was €4.9 million.

BanSabadell Seguros Generales

Premium income for the group's general insurance provider in
2012 was €80.4 million. Sales of non-linked policies did especially
well, with premium income for these products increasing by 9%.

The company reported a profit before sales commissions,
exceptional items and tax of €18.3 million for 2012, with a net
profit of €4.1 million.

BanSabadell Prevision, EPSV

BanSabadell Previsi6n, a voluntary social insurance society,
distributes pension/retirement plans within the Basque Country
and is held in high regard by branch personnel and by customers.

In 2012 the society held savings under management totalling
€303.8 million, a volume increase of 4%.

Mediterraneo Vida

The company's insurance operations in 2012 generated premium
income of €252.4 million, of which €34.9 million were life-with-
protection policies.

In the life-with-savings business the company ended the year
with total provisions of €1,847.1 million.

In its pension fund business, funds under management by
Mediterraneo Vida in 2012 reached a year-end total of €834.1
million. Of this amount €288.9 million related to individual and group

Its profit before sales commissions and tax was €74.6 million
and its net profit to €42.0 million.

and Mediterraneo Seguros Diversos in the insurance and pensions
businesses. It also acts as a broker to companies outside the
group in the insurance field.

The company reported brokered premium income of €304.5
million for 2012.

The profit for the year before commissions and tax was €27.8
million and the profit after tax as €4.2 million.

Securities and custodian services

Following the integration of Ibersecurities from 2010 onwards,
Banco Sabadell further secured its position as a key player in
the Spanish securities market, taking 6.3% of the market in
2012. This was a 35% increase in market share and propelled
Banco Sabadell from seventh to fourth largest Spanish stock
market member firm by trading volume in 2012. This result was
achieved after a successful period of business restructuring and
rebalancing. Banco Sabadell thus showed its capacity to adjust
to and cater for the needs of the market in a highly complex
environment in which the securities brokerage business underwent
a period of radical change.

In its stock broking activities, despite falling asset values
and a fall-off in corporate transactions (in both number and size),
business targets were achieved and prior year performance
levels were exceeded.

—BS America in 2012

—Lydian Private Bank integration completed

Banco Sabadell handled business volumes in excess of USD

clients, including project finance, to products for individual
customers and a full range of the products and services commonly
required by business and professional people and by companies of
all sizes.

Banc Sabadell Miami Branch

At the close of the year Banco Sabadell's operating branch in
Miami had more than USD 2,773 million in deposits and funds
under management. The value of securities under management
for clients was up 11%. Loans and advances were up 3% and
reached USD 1,280 million as the bank sought to meet the needs
of international corporations by arranging facilities to provide
medium- and long-term working capital finance.

In 2012 Banco Sabadell's Miami branch continued to
develop its project finance business in the energy sector,
closing two new project finance deals for wind farms, two for
solar energy and one for gas. All projects financed in 2012 were
located in the USA and Mexico.

In June it acquired the assets and liabilities of the Miami
branch of the former Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo.

Sabadell United Bank

—lIn the second quarter Sabadell United Bank earned a
5-star rating, the highest grade awarded by the independent
US bank rating organization, Bauer Financial

In the course of 2012 Sabadell United Bank completed the
operations and systems integration of Lydian Private Bank, a
Florida-based undertaking that was acquired in 2011 in a take-over
supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
The take-over carried the guarantee of an asset protection scheme
under which the FDIC agreed to absorb 80% of the losses due to
any impairment of specified loans acquired in the transaction.

The integration resulted in the six branches of Lydian Private
Bank being added to the chain of Sabadell United Bank, which
ended the year with a total of 23 branches. The latter's position in
the state of Florida was thus considerably strengthened, especially
on the west coast (Tampa, Sarasota and Naples), making it the
seventh largest local bank by deposits.

In the course of 2012 Sabadell United Bank embarked on a
programme to raise awareness of the brand in the different markets
it serves. The campaign was directed primarily at business and
professional people and also high net-worth individuals, for whom
it is a provider of private banking and wealth management services
through Sabadell Bank & Trust, its wealth management division.

In the area of Corporate Banking Sabadell United Bank
expanded its business during the year through increases in its


--- Page 58 ---

syndicated loans to large corporate clients as well as project
finance deals in the energy and infrastructure sectors, helping
to further its aim of diversifying its loan portfolio and bringing in
valuable new business for the organization.

As 2012 drew to a close, Sabadell United Bank was managing
assets of some USD 3,725 million, with deposits close to USD
3,200 million and loans and advances approaching USD 2,200
million. It was serving more than 45,000 customers. Sabadell
United Bank reported a net profit for 2012 of USD 30 million.

Sabadell Securities

Sabadell Securities USA Inc., an SEC-registered investment
consultancy, operates as a stock broker and advisor to securities
market investors. The business is both a complement to anda
strengthening factor in the BS America strategy.

Sabadell Securities provides investment and wealth
management services to commercial banking customers as
well as personal banking, corporate banking and private banking
clients. Its business strategy is based on meeting customers’
financial needs by providing advice on capital market investments.

Sabadell Securities is a member of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities Investor
Protection Corporation (SIPC). It uses the services of Pershing
LLC, a Bank of New York Mellon subsidiary, for clearing, custody
and administrative services.

Centro Financiero BHD

Banco Sabadell holds a 20% equity interest in Centro Financiero
BHD, the second largest privately-owned financial services group
in the Dominican Republic. It comprises Banco BHD and nine other
subsidiaries providing stockbroking, insurance, pension funds,
fiduciary services and mutual funds.

Banco BHD is itself the Republic's second largest privately-
owned bank. As of November 2012 it accounted for 15.0% of
the total assets of the country's banking system. In December
2012 Fitch Ratings affirmed its AA— (dom) rating with a stable
outlook for long-term debt denominated in local currency; this is
the highest rating assigned by the agency to any Dominican bank.
It also confirmed its F1+ (dom) rating for the bank's short-term
debt, a level that is reserved for institutions with the highest
levels of solvency and liquidity.

At the close of 2012 Banco BHD's total assets stood at
121,805 million Dominican pesos. Loans and advances were
67,169 million pesos and customer accounts were 97,549 million.
Banco BHD's net worth amounted to 12,926 million pesos and
it posted a net profit of 3,155 million pesos. Banco BHD has 95
domestic branches and up-to-date online and telephone banking
channels. It is a provider of financial services to more than 450,000

Asset Management

—Once again Banco Sabadell was ahead of its
peers — by creating a fully dedicated real estate unit

From an early stage in the crisis Banco Sabadell took timely action
to expand its capabilities in the debt recovery and real estate
areas. Solvia, the company tasked with managing the group's real
estate assets, boasts a wealth of expertise in every aspect of the
property development cycle.

In a context of real estate market contraction and falling
property sales, in June 2012 Banco Sabadell's asset management
division adopted a fresh approach by setting up a system to
ensure maximum scalability of its processes for the management
of real estate and non-performing assets and provide it with a
comprehensive picture of asset portfolios and their associated
costs from a real estate, financial and risk management
perspective.

Further reasons for this action were provided by the take-over of
Banco CAM, which demanded increased efforts to make sure our
management capabilities were appropriate to the nature and type
of Banco CAM's real estate holdings, and by regulatory changes in
2012 that could lead to real estate assets being segregated away
from financial institutions.

Sales of real estate properties topped €2,200 million in 2012,
exceeding sales targets for the year and at the same time reducing
the group's exposure to the real estate sector.

BancSabadell d'Andorra

BancSabadell d’Andorra was set up in the principality of Andorra in
the year 2000. Banco Sabadell holds a majority interest. The rest
of the share capital is spread among a large number of minority
shareholders. It remains the only bank in Andorra with a major
bank as a key shareholder and this, combined with the sizeable
number of private Andorran shareholders, clearly differentiates
Banc Sabadell d'Andorra from its competitors in the principality.
The bank's target customers are medium and high-income
individuals and larger companies operating in the principality. Its
share of the domestic market is estimated at about 10%.

Its business falls into two well-defined areas: private banking
and commercial banking. At the close of 2012 business volumes
in both these areas were in the region of €1,300 million, with
loans and advances of €415 million and a profit for the year of
€6.6 million. The ROE was 11.5% and the liquidity ratio, according
to criteria laid down by the principality's supervisory body, the


--- Page 60 ---

Andorran National Finance Institute, was 77% (the legal minimum
is 40%). The loan loss ratio was 0.8%. Shareholders' equity at 31.
December 2012 totalled over €60 million, double the bank's initial
share capital, while the capital adequacy ratio was 19%, well above
the legal minimum of 10%.

— Operations

—The integration of Banco CAM operations and systems was
successfully completed at a faster-than-expected pace

In 2012 the Bank’s efforts were focused on the group’s 3-year
master plan, known as CREA. This focus on transforming the
group’s operating and business processes has given the Bank
the tools it needs to increase productivity and accommodate the
anticipated growth in customer numbers while maintaining the
high-quality service that is the group’s hallmark.

The CREA programme was being implemented simultaneously
with merger and integration processes completed in the course
of 2012 (Banco Urquijo, Banco Guipuzcoano, Lydian Bank and
Banco CAM).

Operational and organization change

Over the year the Bank continued to implement its “operations
factory” programme —designed to reduce the administrative
workload at branches— by consolidating the role of its Regional
Administrative Centre (RAC) in San Sebastian and opening a new
RAC in Alicante.

All through the year the group's RACs in Madrid, Barcelona,
Oviedo and San Sebastian were processing 94% of its service-
related operations and 88% of its loan-related operations.

Central processing of loan and other risks at RACs was in
operation for 85% of the group's branches and should come on
stream for the remaining branches within the first quarter of 2013.

The year saw yet more business processes —enrolments of
customers acquired as a result of "associate banking" arrangements,
for example— being transferred to operations factories, thus freeing
up additional working time for group branches.

In aggregate the RACs, together with the Superdex centres
responsible for processing international payments and the Global
Service Centre which handles more specialized transactions, are
processing more than 407,000 transactions every month. These
processing centres are facilitating future expansion by providing a
platform with the capacity to accommodate the group's strategies
for growth.

The business transformation programme resulted in a number
of other initiatives to increase sales efficiency and sharpen the
focus on sales throughout the organization, while ensuring that the
Bank retained its leadership in service quality.

In 2012, for example, there was further enhancement of the
group’s capabilities in digitization and of service-related workflows
based on more efficient technologies and processes.

--- Page 64 ---

Development work also continued on the group’s current
system of sales incentives, helping to make branches more
sales-oriented.

During the year roll-out continued of the new Proteo 3.0
corporate desktop, giving users a single platform from which to
access a full set of applications, procedures and information for
everyday use by branches; this not only helped to make branches
more sales-oriented but created an operating and business
environment that was considerably more user-friendly.

Another development on the sales front was the launch of a
number of training programmes to improve sales and marketing
skills. These emphasize personal development and rely ona
workforce that is committed to and motivated by change.

Technology

As the year 2012 came to an end the roll-out was completed

of the new virtualized banking platform across the Bank's
branches, including recently integrated branches operating under
the SabadellCAM brand. Roll-out of the workplace virtualization
programme for central service buildings will start in 2013, and will
allow workplace desktops to be accessed from any terminal or
even from a mobile device.

The year also saw a programme of transformation and
optimization actions being implemented which enabled the Bank
to confidently undertake the operations integration of Banco CAM,
involving an amount of data similar in size to that of the Bank.
One of the programme's most visible manifestations was the new
Data Processing Centre (DPC) housed within the Bank's central
service building in Sant Cugat del Vallés (Barcelona). This modern
facility was constructed in accordance with the highest standards
of innovation and energy efficiency and offers unrivalled system
availability, with annual downtime not exceeding ninety minutes.

The programme of IT systems transformation and optimization
carried out in 2012 places the Bank at the forefront of technological
innovation with state-of-the-art equipment giving it the capability to
handle another nine operational integration exercises.

Cost management

During the year the group's cost approval and management system
continued in operation and resulted in costs being 9.3% lower, ona
like-for-like basis, than those initially estimated.

Integration processes

The year 2012 saw the successful completion of four merger and
integration processes, Banco Urquijo, Banco Guipuzcoano, Lydian
Bank and Banco CAM.

Once again the Bank demonstrated its ability to undertake
operational mergers and integrations while continuing its ordinary
activities and without any change in its levels of operating efficiency
or loss in service quality or of focus in the carrying on of business.

The Bank also showed itself to be a banking industry leader in
carrying out successful integrations.

—Human Resources

Composition of group employees

At the end of the year the Banco Sabadell group was employing
a total of 15,596 employees, an increase of 4,921 on the year
before. The average age of employees was 42.36 years and the
average length of service was 16.99 years. The gender split was
49.5% men and 50.5% women.

Employee training

The Bank continued its policy of providing training for all group
employees, achieving high levels of participation —with 90.63% of
employees undertaking some form of training— and dedication. A
total of 372,142.83 training hours were completed, an average of
24.75 hours per employee.

The practice was repeated of using in-house trainers, of whom
there are currently 88 in post.

In 2012 priority was given, first and foremost, to rolling out
job-related training across the entire branch network, with 3,500
employees (about 60% of the total) taking part; and second, to
the "Laude" programme, an arrangement with the University of
Barcelona under which group employees taking in-service training
courses can have their achievement recognized by the award of a
university qualification. The fourth and fifth courses of this type,
both held in 2012, resulted in 116 newly qualified employees, 59%
more than in 2011. Thirteen of the employees who completed one
of these courses did so with a "cum laude" distinction.

Human resources development

In the area of training for senior managers, the year saw further
refinements being made to training methodologies to support the
Bank's "strategic leadership" concept and all activities planned
as part of an intensive programme of executive training that
began in 2010 were fully realized. One key aspect of this training
was the involvement of the Bank's most senior executives in the
continuation of the Management Development Programme, which
was attended by 189 people.

Group level training programmes carried out in 2012 were a
response to the strategic aims of the CREA plan. A priority aim
was training for branch personnel in selling roles. This included
the design of business development strategies by sales managers
and training in sales orientation for employees in customer-facing
roles. The programmes were attended by 302 branch employees.

--- Page 66 ---

A repeat of the "Corporate Management Programme" was also
held and was taken by 64 new middle managers. The aim of the
course was to develop leadership skills within this employee group.

Integration of Banco Urquijo and Banco Guipuzcoano

In May 2012 Banco Urquijo SBP S.A. and Banco Guipuzcoano, S.A.
were merged by absorption into Banco Sabadell. Both mergers
were effected by the dissolution but not liquidation of Banco
Urquijo SBP S.A. and Banco Guipuzcoano, S.A. and the transfer of
their assets and liabilities en bloc to Banco Sabadell by universal
succession. As a result Banco Sabadell was substituted in all
rights and obligations of the merged undertakings generally and
without any reservation or limitation whatsoever.

This decision was taken in response to organizational and
productivity needs and to benefit from synergies from the merged
entities. The mergers proved to be beneficial for the combined
entity and put it in a better position to compete in the marketplace.

With regard to the employees of the merged undertakings, Banco
Sabadell was substituted in all rights and obligations pertaining
to the employment, wages and salaries, social security and other
matters related to the welfare of the employees concerned.

Banco CAM

In the area of personnel management, the integration of Banco
CAM was notable for being conducted in a spirit of constructive
dialogue between the Bank and employee representatives, with the
result that agreement was reached in all key areas of negotiation.

On 15 June 2012, with the aim of reaching a settlement on the
status of Banco CAM employees, Banco Sabadell and employee
representatives concluded an Agreement on terms of employment
and subrogation for all employees of the merged entity.

On 9 October 2012 Banco Sabadell and employee
representatives completed the consultation stage in a redundancy
procedure that had been initiated by Banco CAM. The consultation
ended with an agreement under which the employment of 1,250
employees would be terminated.

As part of the redundancy arrangements, the Bank offered all
employees facing redundancy an ambitious and innovative welfare
package that aimed to set a new standard in socially responsible
behaviour and included measures to reduce impacts on people
and prevent destruction of employment. With the same end in view,
an employment and personal support centre was made available
to all Banco CAM employees, provided by an external organization
that offered counselling to employees on any aspect related to
their future job prospects with Banco Sabadell.

To speed the integration of Banco CAM a successful training
programme was carried out in which more than 364,000 hours'
training was provided to 4,410 employees at Banco CAM branches
— an average of 83 hours' training per employee and a take-up rate
of 94%. The training was rated as "good" or "very good" by 92% of
trainees. A significant role in the training programme was played by
staff members from Banco Sabadell's own branches. In all, 554 of
the Bank's employees were involved, 443 of them as operations
support instructors in the first two weeks post-integration.

Assistance in mapping out the management structure
that would result from the merger was provided by the group's
Organization and Management Unit with the help of state-of-the-art
HR tools and techniques.

— Quality Management

For Banco Sabadell, quality is not just a strategic option; rather, itis a
whole approach to doing business, whether in delivering value to its
stakeholders or in the execution of each and every process forming
a part of that business. This natural affinity with excellence helps to
strengthen the Bank's capabilities in all areas, transforming threats
into strengths and challenges into opportunities for the future.

Consequently the Bank evaluates its activities according to
standards and benchmarks whose purpose is to ensure that its
management approaches are right, and sets itself new goals
based on continual self-criticism.

A key benchmark against which to compare and improve
management practices is the European Foundation for Quality
Management (EFQM) excellence model, on which the Bank
is independently assessed every two years. The most recent
assessment, carried out in October 2012, resulted in the Bank’s
EFQM Gold Seal (+500 points) being renewed with a score of over
600 points being awarded under EFQM’s very demanding standards.

Banco Sabadell continues to be the only Spanish lending
institution with 100% of its financial operations certified to the ISO
9001 standard, providing further proof of its customer-focused and
rigorous approach to process management. In 2012 it passed the
annual review required for the renewal of its certificate.

The Bank also had its "Madrid Excelente" quality mark renewed
for another three years after successfully completing the required
quality audit.

Quality in customer service

Quality in customer service has traditionally been one of the key
drivers of our strategic planning and a distinctive feature of our
positioning in the market.

To make this possible, the Bank uses a set of indicators that
enables it to identify areas for improvement as they develop, both
throughout the whole organization and for each individual branch,
thus providing it with an “instrument panel” to keep track of its
progress in meeting annual targets.


--- Page 68 ---

Key quality indicators include the following:

—Objective quality audits. These use the “mystery shopper”
technique to evaluate the quality achieved by branches in such
areas as courtesy, knowledge, understanding of the customer’s
needs, giving clear explanations, and the quality of information
provided. Audits are carried out on all branches by rotation.

—Industry benchmarking of quality metrics. The quality of
service offered by the Bank’s branches is benchmarked
against that of other lending institutions. Here again the
“mystery shopper” system is used; the quality surveys are
performed by an independent firm of assessors — a guarantee
of the consistency and transparency of assessment process.

—Perceived quality surveys. These are carried out continuously
throughout the year and are based on customer samples. The
large number of responses collected means that the results
are statistically relevant for every one of the Bank's branches.
The surveys are of three types:

—General surveys: These are carried out on random samples
of customers, and use questionnaires adapted for each
customer segment.

—Surveys conducted among new customers to measure their
perceptions as compared with their initial expectations,
once they have had the opportunity to become familiar with
how the Bank and their branch operate.

—Surveys of customers using online banking and other
remote channels. These focus on the aspects of quality
most relevant to those channels.

—Customer claims and complaints. This is one of the indicators
that are of most value in making our processes more efficient
as it gives us precise information on aspects that have given
rise to customer dissatisfaction and therefore require prompt
attention. This information relates to claims and complaints
made through either of the channels provided by the Bank to
customers and users of its services: the Customer Service
Department and the Customer and Stakeholder Ombudsman. In
every year since 2002, Banco Sabadell has been the Bank with
the lowest ratio of complaints made to the Bank of Spain as a
proportion of total revenue. The latest report produced by the
Bank of Spain's complaints department, which for the last two
years has not provided numbers of complaints as a proportion
of gross revenue, shows a total of 82 complaints for Banco
Sabadell. This is far below the numbers reported for other large
and medium-sized banks, and ranks Banco Sabadell in 18th
position based on complaint numbers alone — a much better
position than the size of its turnover would lead one to expect.
This year the Bank of Spain's complaints department published
a list of the 10 banks that had given rise to the most complaints
actually considered. The fact that Banco Sabadell is absent
from that list gives a fair idea of where it might be on a list of
banks ranked according to their complaints-to-revenue ratios
which would, according to internal estimates, once again show
Banco Sabadell as having one of the lowest complaint ratios.

Moreover, since the integration of Banco Guipuzcoano into the
group in April 2011, the data have been reconstructed to include
all group brands within the score for the group as a whole.

** The survey provider has changed its scoring method and this has been applied retrospectively for comparabililty with prior year data. Consequently the values shown for 2009 do not

match those shown in the annual report for that year.

In addition to the above indicators, Banco Sabadell makes use
of other sources of information to obtain further insights into its
quality performance.

According to a market survey on the financial behaviour of
individual bank customers in Spain in 2012, carried out by financial
consultancy FRS Inmark on the top 10 banks by customer numbers,
the Banco Sabadell group (excluding the branches acquired along
with Banco CAM) showed the highest average scores for customer
satisfaction and recommendations (here, the "top two box"
numbers, i.e. the proportion of respondents entering a score of 6
or 7 ona scale from 1 to 7). The research was carried out between
March and July on a nationwide sample of 12,000 people aged 18
or over and living in towns with more than 2,000 inhabitants.

According to FRS Inmark, of the various banks included in the
survey Banco Sabadell (excluding Banco CAM) not only scored
highest in customer satisfaction and recommendations, but also
showed the highest proportional gain in new customers and the
highest proportion of customers increasing their transaction
activity with their bank.

Qualis Prizes for Excellence

Established by the Bank in 2002, the Qualis Prizes for Excellence
are awarded to people and groups of people who have been
particularly noted for the excellence of their work during the year.

The prizes presented in 2012 were those awarded for
performance in 2011. Of particular interest this year were the
prizes for the best bank branches as examples of successful
teamwork, and the Qualis Prizes — Gold category, which are given in
recognition of a person’s track record.

Branches selected for best branch awards were: La Finca
business park in Pozuelo de Alarc6n; Leioa; Ibi; Conil de la
Frontera, and the business branch in Santander. The Qualis Gold
prize was awarded to Miquel Costa Sampere, General Manager of
BS Fincom.

Employee engagement for improvement and innovation

To encourage employee engagement a special web site for Banco
Sabadell group employees, BS Idea, has been set up on the
corporate Intranet.

The site provides a simple and user-friendly way for employees
to use their creativity and to put forward suggestions for
improvements in working methods or additions to the range of
products and services.

A major advantage of this system is its transparency:
employees’ ideas are immediately visible to all other employees
and can be voted on, improved upon or enriched with further
opinions and ideas. This helps to establish priorities for
implementation, since the number of votes in favour of an idea
gives an excellent indication of the benefits that it could bring to
the organization.

In 2012 a total of 2,891 people posted messages on the site
and 1,650 ideas were put forward.

One of the undertakings given to the Eurogroup in July 2012 in
order to obtain the financial assistance requested by the Spanish
government to restructure and recapitalize the Spanish banking
industry, as set out in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)

of 20 July 2012 between the government and the European
authorities, was that a thorough and detailed exercise would be
carried out to estimate the banking industry's capital requirements.
This exercise included a series of stress tests to be performed on
each bank.

—For Banco Sabadell the results of the 2012 stress tests
on Spain's banking system were totally satisfactory

and showed conclusively that the Bank would not need
recapitalizing to face an adverse economic scenario

The purpose of the stress tests was to evaluate the banks'
resilience to an extremely adverse and highly unlikely
macroeconomic setting, so as to put to rest any possible fears
investors might have that some losses on the banks' loan books
had not been adequately recognized.

For the banks in general, and for Banco Sabadell in particular,
the exercise involved the following blocks of work:

—An ad-hoc independent audit to review the carrying values
of loan assets on the balance sheet, including any possible
misstatements of loans and refinancings.
—An in-depth appraisal of real estate assets based on valuations
by external and independent valuers.
—A stress test exercise carried out by an independent
consultancy firm (Oliver Wyman) under the assumption of
an extremely adverse scenario, to provide a highly granular
analysis of possible losses on banks' loan portfolios.
—An in-depth review of the bank's business plans according
to conservative principles to measure its capacity to absorb
hypothetical losses under particularly adverse scenarios. —Capital surpluses or shortfalls
under adverse scenarios (€Mn.)

From the results of the exercise the banks' capital needs were +46,154

finally determined. Banks were classified into groups as follows: eee eeee ks

—Group 0: banks for which no capital shortfall had been identified.

—Group 1: banks in which the Fund for Orderly Bank
Restructuring (FROB) had already taken a shareholding at the
time of the test.

—Group 2: banks that were found to have a capital shortfall in
the stress test and would be unable to fund the shortfall from
private sources or without state assistance.

—Group 3: banks found to have a capital shortfall in the stress test
but with reliable recapitalization plans in place that would enable
them to fund the shortfall without seeking state assistance. Group 0 Group 1 Group 2 Group 3

--- Page 74 ---

In the case of the Banco Sabadell group, the results of the stress
test were entirely satisfactory since the Bank was classified in
the “zero group” of banks for which no capital shortfall had been
estimated under the assumptions used in the test.

Specifically, Banco Sabadell was found to have a capital
surplus of €3,321 million (4.7% of its risk-weighted assets) under
the base scenario, and a capital surplus of €915 million under the
adverse scenario (1.4% of its risk-weighted assets).

The chief categories of risk inherent in the business of
Banco Sabadell and its group are credit risk, market risk and
operational risk.

The accurate and efficient management and control of risk
is critical to realizing the aim of maximizing shareholder value
while ensuring an appropriate degree of financial strength. The
management and control of risk comprises a broad framework
of principles, policies, procedures and advanced evaluation
methodologies, integrated within an efficient decision-making
structure. These are fully and clearly set out in the Annual
Accounts, the Report of the Directors, the Report on Corporate
Governance and the Basel II Pillar 3 Disclosure document, all of
which can be found on the group's web site.

as

Banco Sabadell complies with guidelines drawn up under the Basel
Capital Accord, a fundamental principle of which is that a bank’s
capital requirements should be more closely related to risks
actually incurred, based on internal risk measurement models
which have been independently validated.

Banco Sabadell has supervisory approval for the use of its own
internal models for companies, real estate developers, specialized
financing, retailers and sole proprietors, mortgage loans, personal
loans, personal credit and credit cards, in estimating its regulatory
capital requirements.

Based on the risk metrics provided by these new
methodologies, Banco Sabadell has a consolidated system in
place for measuring risk.

The assessment of risk in terms of an allocated capital
requirement means that risk can be related to return, from
individual customer up to business unit level. The group has
an analytical “risk-adjusted return on capital” system in place
which provides this assessment and includes it as part of the
transaction pricing process.

—Credit risk

Credit risk is the possibility that losses may be incurred as a result
of borrowers failing to meet their obligations or through losses in
value due simply to deterioration in borrower quality.

Approval, monitoring and recovery

To maximize the business opportunities provided by each customer
and to guarantee an appropriate degree of security, responsibility
for monitoring risks is shared between the relationship manager
and the risk analyst, who are thus able to obtain a comprehensive
view of each customer’s individual circumstances.

The Board of Directors delegates powers and discretions to
the Risk Control Committee, which then sub-delegates authority at
each level. The addition of controls on these authority thresholds
to loan approval management systems ensures that the powers
delegated at each level are appropriate to the expected loss
estimates for all loan applications by business customers.

By analysing indicators and early warning alerts, and by
conducting regular credit rating reviews, the quality of a risk can be
constantly monitored in an integrated way.

The establishment of effective processes for managing
existing risk exposures also benefits the process of managing
past due accounts, since the early identification of probable
default cases ensures that measures can be taken proactively.
With an early warning system, the quality of a risk can be
monitored in an integrated way and risks transferred to recovery
specialists who are best equipped to determine the most
suitable type of recovery procedure in each case. Risks above
a certain limit are grouped into categories according to their
expected loss ratios, so that they can be treated in the most
suitable way. Alerts are managed by the account manager and
the risk manager and are supplemented by the experience of the
account that comes from direct contact with the customer.

Credit rating

Credit risk exposures to corporate customers, real estate
developers, specialized financing projects, retailers and sole
proprietors, financial institutions and countries are assessed
according to a system of credit ratings based on predictive factors
and internal estimates of the probability of default. The rating
model is reviewed each year on the basis of an analysis of actual
default data.

Each rating score is assigned an anticipated default rate which
allows consistent comparisons to be made across segments and
with the ratings of independent rating agencies, according to a
master scale.

Credit scoring

Credit risk exposures to individual customers are classified
by means of scoring systems which make use of quantitative
modelling based on historical data to identify key predictive
factors. Two types of scoring are used:

—Behavioural scoring: a system in which all customers are
automatically classified according to their transaction histories
and data for each product taken. It is used primarily for such
purposes as granting loans, setting limits on authorized
overdrafts, targeting sales campaigns, and for tracking and
segmenting in claim and/or recovery procedures.

—Application scoring: this is used to evaluate applications for
personal loans, mortgage loans and credit cards. When full
details of the application have been entered, the system
generates a result based on the estimated borrowing capacity
and financial position of the applicant and the quality of any
security or collateral.

Country risk

This is the risk associated with the debts of a country analysed as
aclass on the basis of factors other than credit risk. It manifests
itself when a borrower is unable to meet its foreign currency
liabilities to external creditors because the country will not allow

access to, or transfers to be made in, that currency, or where a
recovery action against the borrower would fail for reasons of
sovereignty.

An overall exposure limit is set for each country, which applies
across the whole group. Country limits are approved by the Risk
Control Committee and are constantly monitored to ensure that
any deterioration in the political, economic or social situation in a
country can be detected in good time. The rating for each country
provides an additional guide, both when setting limits and in
monitoring them once set.

Credit risk in market trading

Credit risk due to market operations arises from trading in financial
instruments, whether in spot transactions, where the amount

at risk is comparable to the nominal value of the transaction, or
transactions in derivative instruments not traded on organized
markets, where in the great majority of cases the transaction
amount is below the notional value (counterparty risk).

Banco Sabadell has a system in place for assessing and
managing these risks which allows compliance with approved
limits to be monitored and controlled in real time.

In addition, to mitigate exposure to counterparty risk Banco
Sabadell maintains a solid base of collateral agreements —Credit
Support Annexes (CSAs) or Global Master Repurchase Agreements
(GMRAs)— negotiated with key counterparties. The collateral
provisions of these agreements mean that exposure to such
counterparties is significantly reduced.

—Market risk

Discretionary market risk

Discretionary market risk arises from the possibility of loss

in the value of financial asset positions due to variations in

any of the factors affecting market risk (stock prices, interest
rates, exchange rates or credit spreads). It arises primarily from
treasury and capital market positions which can be managed by
using other financial instruments.

Discretionary market risk is measured by the VaR (Value
at Risk) method, which allows the risks on different types of
financial market transaction to be analysed as a single class. VaR
provides an estimate of the anticipated potential maximum loss
on a position that would result from an adverse, but possible,
movement in any of the market risk factors that have been
identified. This estimate is expressed in money terms and is
calculated at a specified date, to a specified confidence level
and for a specified time horizon. The estimate takes account of
different levels of market risk factors.

VaR limits are approved by the Risk Control Committee and
are assigned on a top-down basis, with the overall limit being
divided into sub-limits for different business units and risk
factors. These sub-limits are further subdivided successively
down to individual portfolio level. Apart from VaR limits, other
types of limit are used. These include sensitivity limits, nominal
value limits and stop-loss limits, which complement the view of
risk provided by VaR techniques.

Market risk is monitored on a daily basis and reports on current
risk levels and on compliance with the limits assigned to each
unit are sent to the risk control functions. This makes it possible
to track changes in exposure levels resulting from changes in the
market prices and volatilities of financial instruments.

The reliability of the VaR methodology is validated by
backtesting techniques which are used to verify that the VaR
estimates are within a specified confidence level.

The following graph shows the movement of the 1-day VaR for
trading operations by the group's treasury market operations in the
year 2012 at a 99% confidence level.

Risk control techniques of this kind are supplemented by

special simulation exercises and extreme market scenarios
("stress testing"), the purpose of which is to analyse different
macroeconomic scenarios and their possible impact on the trading
portfolio. The following table shows a stress analysis of this kind
for the most significant portfolio (equity securities).

Structural interest rate and liquidity risk

Structural risk arises from ongoing customer-based commercial
and corporate banking operations and is divided into interest rate
risk and liquidity risk. Management of structural risk seeks to
ensure stability at the margin by maintaining appropriate levels of
liquidity and capital strength.

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is caused by changes, as reflected in the position

or the slope of the yield curve, in the interest rates to which
asset, liability and off-balance sheet positions are linked. Gaps or

2012

mismatches arise between these items because of differences in
repricing and maturity dates so that rate changes affect them at
different times; this in turn affects the robustness and stability of
results.

The management of interest rate risk focuses on overall
financial exposure for the group as a whole and involves proposing
alternative business or hedging strategies that will meet business
objectives and are appropriate to market conditions and within the
exposure limits that apply across the group.

A number of methodologies are used to measure interest rate
risk. These include measuring the sensitivity of net interest income
to changes in interest rates over a one-year horizon. This is done
by means of static (gap analysis) or dynamic (simulation) tests
based, in the latter case, on different assumptions of balance
sheet growth and changes in the slope of the yield curve.

Another technique used is to measure the sensitivity of
shareholders’ equity to changes in interest rates by duration gap
analysis. This measures the effect of interest rate changes over a
longer time horizon.

The sensitivity of net interest income and shareholders' equity
to a 100 basis point change in interest rates for the years 2011
and 2012 is illustrated in the following diagram.

Liquidity risk

This can be defined as the possibility of the Bank’s being unable

to meet payment commitments, even if only temporarily, due to a
lack of liquid assets or of its being unable to access the markets to
refinance debts at a reasonable cost.

Liquidity risk may be caused by external factors such as a
financial market downturn, a systemic crisis or reputational issues,
or internally, by an excessive concentration of maturing liabilities.

Banco Sabadell keeps a close watch on day-to-day changes in
its liquid asset position and holds a diversified portfolio of such
assets. It also carries out projections to anticipate future needs.

In addition, liquidity gap analysis is used to manage
foreseeable mismatches between cash inflows and outflows over
a medium-term horizon. Systematic checks are made to verify that
the group's ability to raise funds on the capital markets is sufficient
to satisfy its requirements in the medium and long term.

The group maintains a number of active funding programmes to
raise finance on the medium- and long-term capital markets. Short-
term commercial paper issuance programmes further diversify
its sources of funds. It is also an issuer of covered bonds and is
active in developing new sources of finance such as asset-backed
securities, which provide a further instrument for the management
of liquidity risk.

The Bank carries out regular liquidity stress testing to enable
it to assess inflows and outflows of funds and the impact of these
flows on its cash position under different scenarios.

Based on this analytical framework, the Bank has a contingency
plan in place to deal with unexpected scenarios that could cause
an immediate funding requirement. Another type of liquidity stress
test that is carried out is to analyse the impacts that changes in
market prices may have on the collateral deposited, whether in
the futures and options markets or under collateral agreements

92

(CSAs and GMRaAs). A range of different market risk scenarios are
studied and the effects of these on liquidity, individually and in
combination, are analysed.

The contingency plan is constantly being updated and identifies
the Bank's assets that are most readily convertible to cash in
the short term; it also sets out action plans should it become
necessary to raise additional cash.

—Operational risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate

or failed internal processes, people and systems or from
unforeseen external events. Banco Sabadell pays particular
attention to operational risk and has implemented a management,
measurement and oversight framework that fulfils the conditions
necessary to opt for the use of an advanced model for calculating
regulatory capital charges for operational risk.

Management of operational risk is decentralized and devolved
to process managers throughout the organization. The full range
of group processes is identified on a corporate process map,
thus facilitating the compiling of information in a way that reflects
the structure of the organization. The group has a specialized
central unit to manage operational risk, whose main functions
are to coordinate, supervise and drive forward the identification,
assessment and management of risks by process managers in
line with Banco Sabadell's process-based approach.

The Board of Directors and senior managers play a direct,
hands-on role in managing operational risk by approving the
management framework and its implementation as proposed by
an Operational Risk Committee made up of senior managers from
different functional areas of the company; they also ensure that
regular audits are carried out on the management strategy being
applied, the reliability of the information being reported, and the
internal validation tests required by the operational risk model.
Management of operational risk is divided into two action areas:

The first action area is based on an analysis in which all
processes and any associated risks that involve potential losses
are identified, leading to a qualitative evaluation of the risks and
their associated control mechanisms. This is done by process
managers in conjunction with the central operational risk unit.
This result is an assessment that allows future exposures to be
recognized as expected and unexpected losses, tendencies to be
anticipated and mitigating action to be taken in an informed way.

This is supplemented by a system for identifying, monitoring and
actively managing risk through the use of key risk indicators. These
can be used to trigger alerts in response to increases in exposure,
identify the causes of that exposure and measure the effectiveness
of the controls in place and any improvements that are made.

Care is taken to ensure that all processes identified as critical
are protected by specific business continuity plans in the event of
a service failure.

The operational risks identified are also assessed from the point
of view of their reputational implications, should an incident occur.


--- Page 82 ---

The second action area is based on experience. It consists of
maintaining a database of all losses that occur in the organization.
This provides a store of information of actual operational risk
events for each business line and the causes of those events, so
that risks can be acted upon and minimized. This loss information
is also of use in measuring the extent to which estimates of
potential loss are consistent with reality, both in terms of severity
and frequency, so that loss exposure estimates are constantly
being updated and improved in this way.

The database contains historical records of actual losses
resulting from operational risk going back to 2002. It is continually
updated as information is received on losses and also on
recoveries, whether resulting from the Bank's own efforts or from
insurance provision.

—Compliance risk

The direct impacts of regulatory nonconformance and loss of
prestige in the eyes of regulators, markets, employees, customers.
and the media have given rise to a vital need for effective
management of compliance risk. Compliance risk may mean
exposure to legal or administrative penalties, significant financial
loss or loss of reputation as a result of infringements of laws,
regulations, internal policies and codes of conduct applicable to
banking.

To cover against this risk the group has adopted a system
of regulatory compliance that is centrally managed within the
parent company, with some functions being devolved to domestic
and foreign subsidiaries and branches abroad. This is a flexible,
risk-focused approach which can be easily adapted to changes
in group strategy as they occur; it also makes use of synergies,
especially in cases involving complex global impacts requiring
technology solutions. The main challenge with this approach is
to achieve a uniform level of regulatory compliance across the
group by establishing minimum standards that must be observed
regardless of the type of business or the country where the
business is located.

The group uses a special methodology to ensure continued
progress in compliance management. This comprises six main
areas:

—A technology solution to integrate compliance within the
group's operating processes so as to ensure high levels of
efficiency as well as total and permanent conformance with
legal requirements.

—Continuous training/instruction for relevant staff through an
annual training programme to raise awareness, highlight and
explain compliance issues of particular sensitivity or involving
the greatest risk.

—Clear procedures to ensure that all persons concerned know
how to act in any situation.

—Swift and effective channels of communication.

—Monitoring and control to ensure compliance with legal
and regulatory requirements.

—The involvement of Compliance in all approvals of new
rules and procedures, in the production or offering of new
investment products, and in the work of identifying newly
introduced regulations and verifying that the changes required
by those regulations are properly implemented. This enhanced
role ensures that the group's operations are in conformity with
all regulatory requirements.

The Banco Sabadell group has an effective control infrastructure
in all areas where a compliance risk may be present, such as
prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism,
market abuse, internal codes of conduct and investor protection
legislation (MiFID). Key actions implemented in 2012 included the
following:


--- Page 84 ---

—Improved systems for identifying transactions giving rise to
suspicions of money laundering.

—Progress in implementing remediation plans to comply with
the requirements imposed by Spain's anti-money laundering
legislation.

—Introducing checks on the business activities of account
holders via an automatic link-up to the database of the General
Treasury of the Social Security system.

—Improving investor protection by implementing a new system to
evaluate the appropriateness of investments.

—Developing a tool for detecting possible market abuse practices.
—Strengthening the mechanisms for monitoring compliance with the
group's Internal Code of Conduct for trading on the stock market.

—Implementing measures to bring greater transparency to all
dealings with customers, particularly in the areas of marketing
and contract terms.

—Making the rule of criminal liability for unlawful conduct
applicable on a group-wide basis.

—NMonitoring and actively participating in the Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act (FATCA) project.

—Extending the group's regulatory compliance system to Banco CAM.

—Introduction

This report on the work of the Audit and Control Committee in
2012 is addressed to shareholders of Banco de Sabadell S.A.
It was signed off by the Committee at its meeting of 23 January
2013 and was submitted to the Board of Directors of Banco de
Sabadell S.A. for approval at its meeting on 24 January 2013.

The Committee is regulated by Article 59 bis of the Articles
of Association and Article 13 of the Regulations of the Board of
Directors of Banco de Sabadell S.A.; it also has its own rules of
organization and procedure which are published on the group
website (www.grupobancosabadell.com).

This regulatory structure ensures that the Audit and Control
Committee is compliant with the reporting requirements laid
down by Law 44/2002 of 22 November on Measures to Reform
the Financial System and later amendments, and incorporates
the main recommendations on the working of audit committees
contained in the Unified Code on Corporate Governance approved
by the CNMV in 2006.

As required by the Bank's articles and other regulations, the
Committee consists of a maximum of five Directors appointed
by the Board, one of whom is appointed by the Board to chair the
Committee. The chairperson may continue to perform that office
for a maximum of four years and cannot be re-appointed for at
least one year after the end of their four-year term. Additional
Directors may be appointed to attend meetings without the right
to vote in order to fill a vacancy on the Committee or replace a
member who is indisposed.

The Board also appoints a Secretary to the Committee, who
cannot be a Director. The Secretary takes minutes of every
meeting and these are approved at the end of the meeting itself
or at the next following meeting. A report of each meeting of the
Committee is read out at the immediately following meeting of the
Board of Directors.

As of 31 December 2012 the members of the Audit and Control
Committee were as follows:

As prescribed by its rules of procedure, all directors on the Audit
and Control Committee are non-executive, independent directors
and have the knowledge and experience required to perform the
duties assigned to the Committee by the Board of Directors.

The Audit and Control Committee meets as often as necessary
and in any event not less than every three months. The Committee
may request the attendance at its meetings of such executives,
including executive Directors, as it sees fit. It may also seek
assistance from independent advisors in carrying out its duties.

This report summarizes the range of activities carried out by
the Audit and Control Committee in the course of the six meetings
that it held during the year 2012, from which it can be seen that
the Committee discharged the duties assigned to it in its rules of
procedure by the Board of Directors of Banco de Sabadell, S.A.
within its main areas of responsibility.

Together with the publication of an annual report on Corporate
Governance and the information available on the group’s website,
the distribution of this report at the Annual General Meeting
underlines once again Banco Sabadell's commitment to providing

24/1988), as well as the consolidated legislation on companies
[Texto Refundido de la Ley de Sociedades Anénimas] as amended
by Royal Legislative Decree 1564/1989 to comply with EU law.

—Activities

Six meetings were held by the Audit and Control Committee in
2012 in accordance with the regulatory structure described above.
Four of these meetings were ordinary or routine in character,

while two were ad hoc meetings to discuss matters of special
interest. Meetings were regularly attended by the Comptroller
General (a member of the Board) and the head of Internal Audit.
Meetings were also attended by the Chief Financial Officer when
the business on the agenda included pre-publication reviews of
quarterly and half-yearly trading and financial reports, and by other
group senior executives when the nature of the business on the
agenda made their attendance desirable.

The Committee also maintained regular contacts with the
external auditors to keep itself informed of progress in the auditing
of the accounts.

These contacts and attendances ensured that the Committee
was able to obtain all the information it required to perform the
tasks delegated to it by the Board of Directors within its main
areas of responsibility, as follows:

Functions related to financial reporting, risk management
and internal control

The Committee carried out a review to verify that banking or
accounting best practice was being applied at all levels of the
organization. On the basis of reports from the External Auditor,
Internal Audit or the Comptroller General, the Committee satisfied
itself that suitable steps were being taken at General Manager
level and by other senior executive functions to ensure that the
group's main risks were being appropriately identified, measured
and controlled.

Supervision of internal controls on the group’s
offshore operations

The Committee paid particular attention to overseeing the system
of internal controls over the group's offshore operations. This
was in response to the Bank of Spain's "Banking Supervision
Memorandum" for 2003 setting out recommendations on the


--- Page 94 ---

policies of banks and other lenders on the use of offshore
locations to expand their overseas operations. In carrying out

this responsibility the Committee reviewed the findings of audits
carried out by official regulators, audit reports prepared by the
Audit Department, the results of audits carried out by units with
local internal audit functions and auditors' reports prepared
during the year 2011 on the accounts of subsidiaries with offshore
operations.

As a result of its review the Committee was able to conclude
that group operations conducted through offshore establishments
were being reduced and that adequate systems were in place
to ensure that offshore establishments were subject to internal
control by the parent company as required by the group's policy
on discontinuing any operations likely to give rise to legal or
reputational risks. A report on this area of the Committee's
supervisory duties was submitted to the Board of Directors on 28
March 2012.

Risk management and control systems

During the year the Committee reviewed the group's risk
management systems as described in reports prepared by the
Risk, Finance and Internal Audit departments.

To meet the group's market disclosure obligations and other
requirements set out in the Bank of Spain's Circular 4/2014
(the "Solvency Circular"), at its meeting on 24 April 2012 the
Committee reviewed the contents of the document entitled "Basel
ll — Pillar 3 Disclosures" dated 31 December 2011, based on an
Internal Audit report provided for the purpose. At that meeting
it also examined information concerning the group's qualifying
capital resources and its capital adequacy position, and discussed
their compliance with the Solvency Circular and the objectives
set out in the group's risk management policies. The Committee
also carried out a detailed review of all financial data relied on as
a basis for the group's conservative risk profile in the different
categories of risk for which disclosure was required: credit and
dilution risk, market risk in the trading book, operational risk,
specific data on equity investments and equity instruments not
included in the trading book, and interest rate risk on non-trading
positions.

With regard to the organization-wide implementation of
internal ratings-based (IRB) credit risk assessment models, the
Committee reviewed the findings of internal audits carried out on
these models at the request of the Bank of Spain's Supervision
Department. These audits enabled the Committee to keep itself
informed of the action being taken to comply with requirements
specified by the Bank of Spain in its approval notices for the use of
Basel Il risk assessment models.

From reports provided to it by Internal Audit during the year, the
Committee was also able to observe the significant progress being
made by the group in developing and rolling out advanced systems
for the management and measurement of operational risk and for
the control of market and counterparty risk.

The Committee also reviewed the results of the stress tests
conducted by Oliver Wyman, which were published in September.
These tests were carried out to determine the capital requirements

of the principal banks in the Spanish banking industry by analysing
the quality of their assets and the individual resilience they
showed to a stressed macroeconomic scenario. The test results
enabled the Committee to observe that Banco Sabadell is solidly
positioned within the "zero group" of banks for which no capital
shortfall was identified.

At its 23 January 2013 meeting the Committee reviewed a
report presented by the Risk Department on risk governance,
management and control systems for the year 2012, and reached
the conclusion that these systems were appropriate to the group's
risk profile.

Internal controls over the preparation and presentation
of regulatory financial information

In 2011 the Audit and Control Committee had approved Internal
Audit's strategic plan for 2011-2013 setting out a detailed
programme for the supervision of the group's system of internal
control over financial reporting (ICFR). The plan provides for the
carrying out of tests on areas considered to be of key importance
within the group and the completion of tests in all areas within the
three years covered by the plan, with the exception of certain areas
or processes considered to be of especial significance; these
include critical controls of period-end closing procedures, reviews
of judgements and estimates and general controls on reporting
systems subject to evaluation on an annual basis.

In the course of 2012 the reports provided by Internal Audit on
the ICFR evaluation tests were presented and were reviewed by
members of the Audit and Control Committee; any weaknesses
identified in the reports were evaluated and the action plans
proposed for correcting them were approved.

A favourable opinion on the ICFR was also expressed by the
External Auditor (PricewaterhouseCoopers) in a report dated 30
January 2012 on the accounts for the year to 31 December 2011.

Functions related to auditing

The Committee's functions in relation to the auditing of accounts
include making recommendations to the Board regarding

the appointment of auditors and reviewing their terms of
engagement. At its meeting of 24 January 2012 the Committee
reviewed group policy on the engagement of auditors and, on
the basis of its review, recommended to the Board that the firm
of PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores, S.L. be re-appointed as
auditors of the Bank's individual and consolidated accounts for
the year 2012. The Board of Directors resolved to submit the
Committee's recommendation to the Annual General Meeting
of 31 May 2012 and the appointment was duly approved by the
General Meeting.

With regard to auditor remuneration, the Committee reviewed
and approved the auditor's fees for 2012. Details of fees paid to
auditors can be found in the annual accounts for the year.

To comply with auditor independence requirements, the Audit
and Control Committee reviewed the main non-auditing services
provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2012. These related


--- Page 96 ---

primarily to the production of reports required by the regulatory
authorities, which this year included reports on the protection

of customer assets as required by the CNMV's Circular 5/2009

of 25 November, the annual report of the external advisor on
anti-money laundering practices, and the Auditor's report on
information concerning the system of internal controls on financial
reporting by quoted companies. The auditors also undertook tasks
related to the production of comfort letters and special reports

on the proforma consolidated financial position at 31 December
2011 and advised on the preparation and compiling of financial
information for inclusion in prospectuses for the increase in

the capital of Banco de Sabadell, S.A. in March 2012. Advisory
services were also rendered, principally in relation to the impacts
of regulatory changes on treasury and capital market operations
and the design of a process model, management procedures and
reporting systems for the Asset Management division to facilitate
the sale of real estate assets. All these tasks were undertaken

in conformity with the independence requirements of the
Consolidated Text of the Law on the Auditing of Accounts issued by
Royal Legislative Decree 1/2011 and Law 44/2002 on Measures
to Reform the Financial System. No activities were undertaken that
would be incompatible with the auditing function.

To verify the group's compliance with statutory limits on
concentrations of auditing business, the Committee reviewed the
proportional share of the fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers
by the group in the firm's total annual revenue. The share was
less than 0.02% of the total for the PricewaterhouseCoopers
worldwide organization, and less than 0.87% of the total for its
Spanish organization. From information provided by the auditors,
the Committee also reviewed the procedures and tools used by
the firm to ensure compliance with the auditor independence
requirements. Written confirmation of the firm's independence
with respect to the Banco Sabadell group was received by the
Committee on 23 January 2013. Based on the results of its
enquiries, the Committee submitted a report to the Board of
Directors, before the Auditor's report on the accounts had been
issued, giving a favourable opinion on compliance with the auditor
independence requirement and concluding that all work for
which auditors had been engaged satisfied the independence
requirements of the Consolidated Text of the Law on the Auditing of
Accounts issued by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2011.

The Committee remained in contact with the Auditor constantly
throughout the year to ensure that it was kept informed of any
significant accounting or financial reporting issues arising in the
course of the Auditor’s work.

In the area of external supervision and regulation, the
external auditors reported to the Committee, at its meeting on 19
December 2012, on the provisions of Law 8/2012 (implementing
Royal Legislative Decree 18/2012) on the revaluation and sale
of real estate assets, and of Law 9/2012 (implementing Royal
Legislative Decree 24/2012) on the restructuring and resolution
of credit institutions, with further implementing provisions under
Law 1559/2012. The Committee also received a report on the
requirement that financial institutions prepare recovery plans
setting out different crisis scenarios along with details of warning
indicators and measures to respond to such scenarios, the
estimation of impacts and an operational and reporting plan.

As part of the Committee's oversight of the auditors'
performance of their terms of engagement, at its meeting of 23
July 2012 the auditors reported on the results of their review of the
summary consolidated accounts for the first half of 2012, giving
the accounts a clean bill of health.

At the same meeting the auditors presented to the Committee,
for submission by the Directors to the Annual General Meeting, the
results of their review of the merged balance sheet and statement
of changes in equity for Banco de Sabadell, S.A. and Banco CAM,
S.A.U. prepared specially to meet the requirements applicable to
corporate mergers under the Consolidated Text of the Law on Public
Limited Companies [Texto Refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de
Capital] approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010, and by
reason of the proposed merger of Banco Sabadell and Banco CAM,
in which the latter would be absorbed by the former.

The auditor also presented to the Committee, at its meeting
on 23 January 2013, the findings of its review of the individual and
consolidated annual accounts for the year 2012. As in previous
years, the opinion expressed by the auditor on the accounts was
that they presented a true and fair view, in all material respects,
of the consolidated financial position of the Bank and the group
and of the results of their operations and their cash flows for
the year as required by applicable financial reporting standards
and regulations and, in particular, the accounting principles and
practices embodied therein.

Functions related to trading and financial reports

In the course of the year the Committee paid particular attention to
reviewing the Company's accounts and its quarterly and half-yearly
trading and financial reports as well as other information disclosed
to the market, including the share prospectus, before they were
released for publication.

At its meeting of 28 March 2012 the Committee reviewed and
reported favourably on the share prospectus of Banco de Sabadell
S.A. to be filed with the National Stock Market Commission
(CNMV) in accordance with EU Commission Regulation (EC)
809/2004 of 29 April 2004 which came into effect on 18
July 2005, implementing Directive 2003/71/EC as regards
information contained in prospectuses as well as the format,
incorporation by reference and publication of such prospectuses
and dissemination of advertisements.

At the Committee's meetings of 24 April, 23 July and 23
October 2012 and 23 January 2013, the Committee reported
favourably on the quarterly financial statements for the periods
ending on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December
2012 respectively, prior to the their being approved by the Board of
Directors and released to the markets.

At its 23 July meeting the Committee reported favourably on
the summary consolidated half-year financial statements of the
Banco Sabadell group for filing with the National Stock Market
Commission (CNMV), finding them to have been prepared and
presented in conformity with IAS 34 on Interim Financial Reporting
as incorporated into IFRS-EU, with the detailed disclosure
requirements specified by the CNMV in its Circular 1/2008 of 30
January, and with article 12 of Royal Decree 1362/2007.


--- Page 98 ---

In undertaking this work the Committee received documents
and held meetings with the Comptroller General, the Chief
Financial Officer and the Auditor to satisfy itself that the applicable
accounting principles had been properly applied.

Functions related to the work of Internal Audit

One of the Committee's tasks is to approve the plans and
methodologies of the Internal Audit department and assess the
extent to which the department's plans are being followed and its
recommendations are being implemented. This responsibility was
met largely through the approval and oversight of the Internal Audit
Year Plan.

The work of Internal Audit in 2012 consisted mainly of
conducting a review, according to the principles underlying the
strategic internal auditing plan for 2011-2013, of the group's
internal control systems to mitigate any financial risk, credit
risk, operational risk or accounting or regulatory risk to which its
operations are exposed. At the Committee's meeting of 23 July
2012 an internal audit plan for Banco CAM for the period June
to December 2012 (drawn up according to the Banco Sabadell
method), was presented to the Committee. The plan was primarily
concerned with processes for managing credit risk, operational risk
and liquidity risk. The plan also included a review of the integration
of Banco CAM systems onto the group's IT platform and certain
other mandatory audits related to compliance.

The implementation of the Internal Audit plan resulted in the
production of over 400 audit reports and the main findings of
these reports, along with replies from senior management to the
recommendations contained in the reports, were evaluated by the
Committee.

All meetings held by the Committee were attended by the
Comptroller General and the head of Internal Audit. The following
reports were presented:

—A report on the main internal auditing results for the fourth
quarter of 2011, at the meeting of 24 January 2012.

—A summary of Internal Audit's annual report on its activities
in 2011 and its proposed plan of activities for 2012, at the
meeting of 24 January 2012.

—A report on the main internal auditing results for the first
quarter of 2012, at the meeting of 24 April 2012.

—A report on the main internal auditing results for the second
quarter of 2012, at the meeting of 23 July 2012.

—A report on the main Internal Audit results for the third quarter
of 2012, at the meeting of 23 October 2012.

The Committee kept itself fully informed of progress in
implementing the recommendations of previous audit reports and
each meeting included the presentation of a report on the Audit
Department's monitoring of the group “instrument panel” of key
quality indicators.

Functions related to compliance with legal and regulatory
requirements on Corporate Governance

One aspect of the Committee's work in the area of corporate
governance was to review reports prepared by the Comptroller
General and Internal Audit on compliance with applicable laws,
internal Company rules and regulatory requirements.

To comply with the requirements of Royal Decree 217/2008 for
regular reviews of compliance with the EU Directive on Markets in
Financial Instruments (MiFID) by investment services companies,
the Audit and Control Committee received information specifically
related to the implementation of MiFID rules by the Banco Sabadell
group, based on an internal audit report prepared for the purpose.

In addition, as required by the CNMV in its Circular 5/2009 of
25 November, the Committee reviewed the Auditor's annual report
on the protection of customer assets held or managed by Banco de
Sabadell, S.A., Banco Guipuzcoano, S.A., Banco Urquijo Sabadell
Banca Privada, S.A., Banco CAM, S.A.U. and Gestidn de Activos
del Mediterraneo, Sociedad de Valores, S.A., from the point of view
of the adequacy of arrangements made by these undertakings to
comply with customer asset protection requirements. The findings
of these reports were satisfactory and no gaps or significant
weaknesses were identified in relation to the existence and
appropriateness of internal asset protection systems in any of the
undertakings.

In accordance with the requirements on the revaluation and
disposal of real estate assets held by financial companies, under
Royal Legislative Decree 18/2012, the Committee reviewed
the Banco Sabadell group's plan of action to comply with these
requirements, approved by the Executive Committee of the Bank of
Spain according to a communication dated 27 June 2012.

Corporate Governance

At its meeting of 24 January 2012 the Committee decided to
recommend that the Board of Directors give its approval to a report on
the structure and practice of Corporate Governance at Banco Sabadell
that had been submitted by the Executive Committee in 2011.

At its meeting of 23 July 2012 the Committee approved

Self-evaluation

Following Corporate Governance guidelines, the members of the
Audit and Control Committee carried out a self-evaluation and
submitted a report containing an assessment of the Committee's
performance to the Board of Directors for consideration at its
meeting of 19 December. The report found that the Committee had
fully and properly discharged the responsibilities entrusted to it in
its rules of procedure by the Board of Directors of the Bank.

Reports from supervisory authorities

During the year the Committee was briefed on the main points
of reports put out by supervisory authorities in Spain and other
countries in which the group operates. From the information
provided the Committee was able to satisfy itself that the
recommendations of the supervisory authorities were being fully
implemented.

—Conclusion

The activities described in this report ensured that the Audit and
Control Committee was able fully to discharge the duties assigned
to it in its rules of procedure by the Board of Directors of Banco de
Sabadell, S.A., within its main areas of responsibility.

As a result of its review and oversight of reports received during
the year from the Comptroller General, the Chief Financial Officer,
Internal Audit and the external auditor, the Committee was able to
conclude that the annual accounts to be signed off by the Board
of Directors provide a true and fair view of the assets and financial
position of Banco Sabadell and the results of its operations, and
contain all information necessary for their comprehension.

The Committee has, in addition, verified that all business,
financial and legal risks to which Banco de Sabadell S.A. and
its subsidiary undertakings may be exposed are clearly and
straightforwardly explained in the annual accounts and the report
of the Directors. Finally, it has reviewed the contents of the

—Report on Directors' remuneration by the Board of Directors
of Banco de Sabadell, S.A., following a recommendation from
the Nomination and Remuneration Committee

1—Introduction

This report was drafted by the Board of Directors of Banco de
Sabadell, S.A. on a recommendation of the Nomination and
Remuneration Committee, to comply with article 61 ter of the
Securities Market Act 24/1998, of 28 July, as amended by the
Sustainable Economy Act 2/2011, of 4 March, which requires that
the report be distributed and submitted to a consultative vote as a
separate item of the agenda of the Annual General Meeting.

Broadly speaking, Banco Sabadell's remuneration policy has been
based on combining the principles of compensation for hard work,
responsibility and professional track record with the desire to align
value creation, shareholder interests, and prudent risk management.

Banco Sabadell has drawn up a remuneration policy for the
members of the Board in accordance with the applicable legislation,
having regard for recommendations from the Committee of
European Banking Supervisors and in accordance with the Articles
of Association and the Regulations of the Board of Directors.

The policy also complies with the recommendations of
the Spanish National Securities Commission’s Unified Good
Governance Code for Listed Companies of 22 May 2006, and
specifically with recommendations 8 and 35 to 39.

Articles 217, 218 and 219 of the Companies Act [Ley
de Sociedades de Capital] sets out basic rules for director
remuneration and expressly states that remuneration must be
fixed in the Articles of Association.

Article 81 of Banco Sabadell's Articles of Association states
that director remuneration will consist of a share in the profits
not exceeding 3% of the company's net profit, and the Board is
empowered to set the annual remuneration of its Board members
and its distribution among the Board members within this limit.
Article 22 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors states that
directors will be entitled to remuneration set by the Board of Directors
in accordance with the Articles of Association and recommendations
from the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.

In the case of directors who also perform executive functions,
Article 81 establishes that, subject to approval by the General
Shareholders' Meeting, those directors may also participate in
incentive schemes approved for Bank executives consisting of
payments in the form of shares, stock options or remuneration
linked to the share price. At all events, remuneration for executive
functions will align with the general principles of the Bank, and the
criteria of deferral and payment in shares established for Senior
Management will apply to them.

of the Board of Directors, the executive directors, the Bank's
senior management, and for systems under which the Board
shares in the company's profits. It also advises on the directors’

6—Anticipated directors’ remuneration for 2013

In view of the economic circumstances and pressure on the
financial system, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee
has recommended to the Board of Directors that remuneration for
all members of the Board for non-executive functions be reduced
by 15% in 2013.

7—Executive directors' remuneration for performing
executive functions

A Broadly speaking, and in particular as regards executive
functions, remuneration at Banco Sabadell is seen as a
value-creating factor by which to attract and retain the best
professionals, and should include a competitively-structured
remuneration package which, in certain cases, should include
a variable remuneration component that is linked to specific
objectives aligned with shareholders’ interests.

B The principles of the remuneration policy for executive
directors who perform executive functions are as follows:

a Executive directors receive fixed and variable remuneration
corresponding to their specific post. A suitable balance has
been established between the fixed and variable components
of remuneration.

b The criteria as to performance and attainment of set
objectives which determine fixed and variable remuneration
components are the same as for the Bank's senior managers,
and seek to provide overall remuneration that is competitive
according to comparable market parameters and in which
variable remuneration accounts for a significant portion.

c Variable remuneration is based on a range of factors, in
particular professional performance, and is not determined
simply by the general performance of the markets or sectors in
which the entity operates or other similar circumstances.

d Remuneration policy conforms to the business strategy and to
the Bank's long-term objectives, values and interests, in line
with the principles that govern customer and investor protection.

e The evaluation combines the Bank's individual and
consolidated results, having regard for current and future
risks associated with earnings as well as the cost of capital
employed and the required liquidity.

f Standard conditions in these types of relationships were taken
into consideration when drafting contracts, and the terms
were set in accordance with prevailing market standards.

g The remuneration system is complementary to the incentive plan
for executives of Banco Sabadell, the conditions of which were
approved by the General Meeting on 25 March 2010.

C Executive Directors
In 2012, the executive directors of Banco Sabadell were:
— Josep Oliu Creus, Chairman.
— Jaume Guardiola Romojaro, Managing Director.
— José Luis Negro Rodriguez, Director and Comptroller-General
(appointed on 31 May 2012).


--- Page 110 ---

D Fixed remuneration for 2012
Fixed remuneration for executive directors was set on the
basis of their maximum level of responsibility and rewards
their contribution in each position they hold and their executive
and leadership skills. Comparable situations in the market
were taken into consideration to calculate the remuneration.
Fixed remuneration includes the pay elements established by
the various agreements that apply to all employees of the Bank.
Fixed remuneration in 2012 amounted to €1,301,269 for
Josep Oliu Creus, €846,083 for Jaime Guardiola Romojaro
and €366,668 for José Luis Negro Rodriguez, from the date on
which the latter was appointed to the Board of Directors.
The Managing Director also received a fixed annual
amount of €400,000.

E Variable remuneration paid in 2012
Variable remuneration in 2012, calculated as a function of
2011 earnings, was paid in February 2012. In accordance with
the rules established by Royal Decree 771/2001, of 3 June:

a 50% of variable remuneration was paid in the form of Banco
Sabadell shares.

b At the same time, 50% of total variable remuneration has been
deferred, and is expected to be paid in three equal parts in the
next three years.

c 50% of each payment is received in the form of Banco
Sabadell shares.

d The shares delivered have a vesting period of one year as from
the delivery date.

The Chairman's variable remuneration was set by the
Nomination and Remuneration Committee, based on an
objective benchmark, i.e. earnings, and other relevant aspects
such as management performance in the year. This resulted in
a payment of €182,500.

The Managing Director's variable remuneration has been
fixed by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee based on
the group's earnings; however, a set of objectives, each with a
different weighting, has been established, including: earnings,
net increase in customer numbers, liquidity gap and demand
account market share, resulting ina payment of €172,274.

Under the variable remuneration payment system
described above, 36,726 Banco Sabadell shares were
delivered to the Chairman, and 34,783 to the Managing
Director.

F Pension commitments
Contributions in respect of pension commitments were
provided through insurance policies in the amount of
€985,636.91 for Josep Oliu Creus and €1,385,719.00 for
Jaime Guardiola Romojaro. Additionally, each of them received
contributions to their pension plans in the amount of €762.08.

G Multi-year variable remuneration system
The remuneration system also includes an incentive scheme
for all Banco Sabadell executives, the terms of which were
approved by the Annual General Meeting on 25 March 2010.
Under the terms of the scheme, known as Stock

Appreciation Rights 2010-2013, the Chairman has been
assigned 2,600,000 rights, the Managing Director 2,000,000
rights, and the Comptroller-General 800,000 rights. However,
according to the scheme terms as currently drafted, no rights
has vested as of the date of this report.

H Other benefits
During the year the following amounts were recognised
remuneration in kind: €28,727 for the Chairman,
€9,211 for the Managing Director, and €5,429 for the
Comptroller-General.

8—Anticipated remuneration payable to executive directors
in 2013 for performing executive functions

The remuneration policy envisaged for executive directors in 2013
will be based on the general principles established by Banco
Sabadell and detailed in this report.

The variable remuneration for 2012 and the first one-third
instalment of variable remuneration for 2011 will be paid in 2013.

The implementation of the system to pay variable remuneration
for 2012 in options on Banco Sabadell shares will be submitted to
the Annual General Meeting for approval in 2013. With this system,
which does not involve additional remuneration, executive directors
may receive 100% of their variable remuneration for the discharge
of duties in 2012 in the form of stock options with a three-year
vesting period, which fully complies with all legal and corporate
governance requirements in connection with the deferral of variable
remuneration and payment in the form of equity instruments.

Under this system, 100% of the variable remuneration received
by executive directors in 2013 will be linked to share performance
in the coming years.

—Corporate
social
responsibility


--- Page 114 ---

Banco Sabadell has adopted a set of principles on corporate
social responsibility which apply across the organization and to all
areas of its business. They are manifested through policies and
initiatives pursued both nationally and internationally.

The Bank’s compliance, CSR and Corporate Governance
department is responsible for coordinating policy on social
responsibility once it has been approved by the Board of Directors.

In an adverse economic and social environment accompanied
by large-scale financial sector restructuring, the group showed its
ability to carry out a coherent corporate social responsibility policy
which identifies and prevents or mitigates possible social impacts
and creates shared value for stakeholders.

For a large part of the year 2012 Banco Sabadell was
meeting the challenge of integrating Banco CAM, during which it
demonstrated that its key values of transparency, truthfulness and
trust were paramount.

—A member of the SECE company’s Corporate Social
Responsibility External Committee

Banco Sabadell reports on its economic, social and environmental
performance in its Annual Report on Corporate Social
Responsibility, following the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3.4
international guidelines and supplement on the financial services
sector. Once again, the report was verified by external auditors and
received the maximum rating of A+ from the GRI.

Some of the year’s most significant CRS highlights are
briefly described below. These are set out in more detail in the
2012 Report on Corporate Social Responsibility. The report
is available to stakeholders on the corporate website (www.
grupobancosabadell.com), together with the Report on Corporate
Governance for 2012.

Promoting economic growth

Banco Sabadell acquitted itself satisfactorily in the independent
audits carried out in 2012 by consultancy firm Oliver Wyman on
Spain’s leading financial institutions to establish their capital
requirements in an adverse economic scenario. The Bank was,
classed in group O which included all institutions that already
held capital resources sufficient to weather the most adverse
macroeconomic conditions and were shown to be creditworthy.

Each year Banco Sabadell supports subsidized funding
schemes sponsored by the Official Credit Institute as well as the
principal schemes promoted by Spain’s autonomous regions. It
also maintains agreements with a majority of the country’s Credit
Guarantee Societies (Sociedades de Garantia Reciproca) whose
purpose is to provide guarantees to SMEs to enable them to
obtain finance.

In 2012 Banco Sabadell took the third largest share of funding
disbursed under the ICO-funded schemes, with 12.2% of the total.

Financial services and sustainability

Banco Sabadell and the European Investment Bank have signed
an agreement with the aim of injecting funding amounting to

€400 million into SMEs. The agreement includes a prohibition on
financing for sectors or activities that are unethical or which, for
example, have negative environmental impacts, are engaged in the
manufacture of weapons or are in violation of people’s rights or
whose activities are merely financial in character.

During the year, Banco Sabadell provided more than €643
million for structured finance deals. In 2012 a total of 17 deals
incorporating the Ecuador Principles were concluded, of which 88%
were in the field of renewable energy.

Banco Sabadell offers a number of socially responsible
investments:

—Sabadell BS Inversion Etica y Solidaria, Fl, an ethical
mutual fund


--- Page 116 ---

—Urquijo Cooperaci6n, SICAV
—Plan de Pensiones Etico y Solidario, an ethical pension plan
—BS Ahorro Futuro

A long-term relationship

Once it had officially registered the acquisition of Banco CAM,
Banco Sabadell set in motion action plans to rebuild trust among
customers of the former saving bank and to raise standards of
quality and service to the levels required by Banco Sabadell. This
resulted in the holding of face-to-face meetings with individual
customers at SabadellCAM branches to discuss their concerns.

The Bank also offered to holders of preferred shares and
subordinated notes issued by Banco CAM the option of exchanging
these for securities that were more liquid and better suited to the
current regulatory and trading environment.

Financial education

Banco Sabadell is providing its customers with the knowledge and
tools they need to manage their finances and is constantly working
to offer them financial solutions to meet their needs.

For the third year in succession, Banco Sabadell organized
a drawing competition for children, named “What's money for?”
The competition was open to boys and girls between the ages of
O and 13 years wishing to put their skills to use. The Bank set up
a website providing materials and games to help children learn
the value of money and the importance of saving. A new feature
of the competition this year was an instruction guide written
with the help of teachers and educational theorists. The guide
contained material to help turn the questions that young children
ask about money into opportunities for learning and discussion
between parent and child.

Banco Sabadell set up an online “Personal Finance” service to
help people organize and manage their household affairs.

A self-help programme entitled “Exportar para crecer” (Export
to Grow) was launched by Banco Sabadell in partnership with
business schools, associations and other organizations, with
the aim of helping SMEs and other companies to become more
international as a way out of the crisis. The programme offers
a variety of learning sources and channels: a practical guide to
foreign trade, seminars, video sessions, knowledge nuggets,
practical examples of SMEs going international, etc. (www.
bancsabadell.tv/servicios).

People are key

The enthusiasm, dedication, professionalism and capacity for work
shown by Banco Sabadell employees were key to the successful
integration of Banco CAM.

At the end of the year the group was employing a total of
15,596 employees, of whom 50.5% were women.

Leadership and training

In 2012 the Bank concentrated on providing leadership and other
training programmes for top group executives and supporting
employees of the newly acquired Banco CAM as they became
integrated into the organization. This included:

—An expanded management and leadership training programme
for senior managers, prospective heads of department and
newly-appointed managers in Central Services divisions.

—A repeat of the LAUDE programme, an arrangement under
which Bank employees completing in-service training courses
are awarded academic qualifications from the University of
Barcelona’s Institute for Continuous Training (IL3-University
of Barcelona). These qualifications are in accordance with the
European Education Area framework.

—A special learning platform set up to support employees of
the former Banco CAM throughout the process of integration
and to ensure that they acquired the knowledge and skills they
needed to work as employees of the group.

—A first series of lectures given at the new Central Services
building, opened in June 2012, on the theme of “Business and
Values”. Speakers included key names from the corporate and
academic worlds and eminent senior citizens.

Minimizing social impact and improving employment prospects

To minimize the social impact of staff reductions required by the
European Commission in connection with the acquisition of Banco
CAM, Banco Sabadell launched a re-employment plan to help
employees taking voluntary redundancy or affected by collective
dismissal to find alternative work. This included providing former
employees with counselling to improve their chances of finding
employment and, at the same time, offering them credit on
favourable terms, one year’s rent-free use of office space or
business premises, and vocational guidance.

The plan also included action to revitalize business in areas where
the numbers of people leaving Banco CAM were greatest and to
generate employment through the promotion of business initiatives.

Equality and integration

The committee responsible for monitoring the group’s Equality
Plan, made up of employee and management representatives,
meets twice a year to review progress in implementing the Equality
Plan, which was signed in 2010.

To make businesses more aware of women’s potential in senior
managerial roles, Banco Sabadell is working with the Alumni
Association of the ESADE Business School in organizing training
sessions under the title “The Women and Leadership Forum”.

Premises and the environment

In 2012 Banco Sabadell opened a new office building at the Banco
Sabadell Centre in Sant Cugat del Vallés. The new building is an
extension to the group’s main corporate headquarters which was
awarded the LEED-NC (New Construction) Gold Certificate v. 2.2.
According to the performance data required for certification, the new
building is approximately 23% more efficient in energy consumption
and 65% in water usage compared with a standard building of the
same type.

Banco Sabadell has six buildings certified to the ISO 14001
standard.

Social commitment

Banco Sabadell promotes community-based programmes
and cultural activities or events through the Banco Sabadell
Foundation, the Banco Herrero Foundation and the Banco Sabadell
Sponsorship Committee. In 2012, the Bank invested €3,841,821
million in community projects and cultural activities.

Full information on the group's Foundations and annual award
schemes is provided in the “Society” section of the group website.
Some key awards include:

—The Fundacion Herrero Prize (ninth year) awarded to Dr
Emilio J Castilla for research into organizational aspects of
work and employment.

—The Banco Sabadell Prize for Biomedical Research (Seventh
year) in recognition of the work of Dr Ben Lehner, aged 33, for
what the jury described as his “brilliant and original contribution
to the understanding and prediction of how genetic mutations
lead to phenotypic changes and cause disease”.

—The UPF Emprén Prize (fourth year) awarded by the Pompeu
Fabra University’s Social Council and the Banco Sabadell
Foundation. The prize rewards undergraduates who display
initiative and business talent; in 2012 the prize was won by the
MyVoicer project, a portable text reader for the blind.
