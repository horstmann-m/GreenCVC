Dear Shareholder,

Banco Sabadell ended the year 2012, the 131st in its history, showing good income growth,
improved business margins and a substantially stronger liquidity position, having reinforced
its core capital and exceeded the levels of capital required to pass the stress tests carried
out on the Spanish financial sector. All of this was achieved despite an operating environment
characterised by continuing financial market turmoil, weak economic activity and, in Spain, a
financial industry undergoing a process of radical reform and root-and-branch restructuring.

In the first half of the year, the eurozone sovereign debt crisis had a particularly severe impact
on Spain and the fragmentation of capital markets highlighted the difficulties of the euro. The
action taken by the European authorities to tackle the crisis from the middle of the year onwards
brought about an improvement in the funding position of the systemic countries on the European
periphery. In particular, Europe decided to take more resolute steps towards economic, fiscal and
financial integration, while the European Central Bank launched a new programme of sovereign
bond purchases, thus effectively making itself a lender of last resort to the treasuries of the euro
zone’s more solvent countries.

On the economic front, global activity in 2012 was characterized by weakness in the eurozone
and particularly in Spain, although economies in the rest of the world moved in a more positive
direction. The Spanish economy struggled under the prevailing difficult financial conditions and
activity was further constrained by a tight fiscal policy and private sector deleveraging, causing
the economy to go into reverse again after having grown slightly in 2011.

In late June the Spanish authorities asked for external financial assistance for the banking
sector. In line with the promises made to obtain the assistance, the country’s financial sector has
been undergoing a major programme of reform and large-scale restructuring and recapitalization
under the supervision of the Spanish authorities and according to guidelines laid down by the
European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF.

Key conditions for restoring Spain’s banks to financial health were that banks should set
aside large amounts of provisions to cover their real estate assets and that, following an in-depth
external assessment, some banks would be recapitalized from public funds and their troubled
assets transferred to an asset management company (to be known as SAREB) whose capital
would largely be funded by the state through the Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (FROB).

Despite the difficulties facing the sector, Banco Sabadell was given a clean bill of health in
the stress tests carried out on the whole of the Spanish banking industry in 2012, being classed
among the most solvent of the systemic banks making up the Spanish financial system.

Our core capital was greatly strengthened during the year, with share capital increasing by
€3,092 million. Actions such as the exchange of Banco Sabadell preferred securities for ordinary
shares in January, the exchange of Banco CAM preferred and subordinated securities for Banco
Sabadell ordinary shares in June and July, and the capital-raising rights issue in March, brought
the core capital ratio up to 10.4%, and this at a time when we were absorbing the Banco CAM
balance-sheet.

Our liquidity position improved substantially in the course of the year thanks in large measure
to a high inflow of new customer accounts, allowing us to generate a positive funding gap of more
than €15,000 million in 2012 on the back of the demand for investment products.

Energetic balance-sheet management, careful setting of interest spreads and a strong
performance in winning new business made it possible to end the year with net interest income
up 21.5% and gross operating income up 18% on the year before. Profit before impairment
provisions was €1,289.9 million, a year-on-year increase of 4.8% with Banco CAM administrative
expenses included; on a like-for-like basis, however, recurring costs for 2012 were down 5.9% on
the year before.

Banco Sabadell’s net profit for the year 2012 was €81.9 million after setting aside in balance-
sheet strengthening and asset impairment provisions totalling €2,540.6 million — 142.2% more
than the previous year.

Once again Banco Sabadell was able to report a remarkable achievement in new customer
acquisition. With enrolments reaching 8,000 a week, the number of individual customers rose by
18.2% and business customers by 31.4% compared with the previous year.


--- Page 2 ---

After a year in which default rates in the banking system continued to rise, Banco Sabadell
ended 2012 with a loan loss ratio that remained below the industry average; the gap with respect to
the ratio for the banking industry as a whole has increased by a factor of 2.6 over the last two years.

The year 2012 saw the successful completion of merger and integration processes for four
entities: Banco CAM, Banco Urquijo and Banco Guipuzcoano in Spain, and Lydian Private Bank in
the USA. Once again the Banco Sabadell group demonstrated its proven ability to carry out such
processes alongside its ordinary activities without any impact on operating efficiency or service
quality, or disruption to the conduct of business.

The integration of Banco CAM was of particular significance in bringing about a transformative
leap for Banco Sabadell and positioning us as Spain’s fourth largest privately-owned banking
group. Total group assets increased by more than 60% and the group’s customer base doubled
to more than 5.5 million. The actions we have put in hand to ensure a successful relaunch of the
branch network under the new SabadellCAM brand name, and our determination to win back the
trust of customers of the former Banco CAM as soon as possible, have been key factors in kick-
starting a recovery in deposits and restoring market shares to their historic levels.

By the end of the year we had brought the integration of Banco CAM operations and systems
to a successful conclusion and thus fulfilled our ambitious work schedule to the letter.

With Banco Urquijo and Banco Guipuzcoano now merged into the organization we were able,
first, to position the SabadellUrquijo brand as the name to watch in private banking in Spain
and, second, to increase our potential for growth in the northern part of the country under the
SabadellGuipuzcoano banner.

In the USA we continued to make progress in growing our retail banking operation in Miami,
Florida: Sabadell United Bank. We completed the integration of Lydian Private Bank’s operations
and systems into those of Sabadell United Bank, strengthening its position and making it the
seventh largest local bank by deposits. We also opened a representative office in New York which
is proving to be a useful complement to our Miami-based operation.

This year we set up an Asset Management division, a special unit tasked with managing the
group’s real estate and doubtful assets. By so doing we put ourselves a step ahead of the rest of
the industry and became pioneers in creating a dedicated operating unit to respond effectively to
the needs generated by the real estate crisis.

Finally, in the last part of the year, we came to an agreement with Banco Mare Nostrum (BMN)
to purchase its branch banking business in Catalonia and Aragon; we hope to bring this to a
conclusion in the course of 2013.

This annual report contains accurate and detailed information on major developments
during year 2012 and on how the group has performed in the current highly complex economic
and financial environment. The data provided here reflects the soundness and the growth of
our ordinary operations and evidences the group’s capacity to generate positive results despite
the enormous efforts made to increase provisions while continuing to boost liquidity and add
strength to our balance-sheet.

This year Banco Sabadell prepared the ground for a progressive return to reasonable levels
of profitability after several years of setting aside very large amounts in provisioning expenses to
face the consequences of the economic crisis.

We laid the foundations for the Bank’s future development by absorbing organizations that
were unable to remain competitive on their own; they will now provide the group with a regional
foothold for business expansion in the coming years.

The professionalism of the Banco Sabadell group and the expertise it has shown in
managing the crisis give us reason to be optimistic about prospects for getting our earnings
back to normal levels.

—Macroeconomic Environment

The sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone worsened in the first half
of the year, with particularly virulent effects on countries like Spain
and Italy. The prevailing complex environment was reflected in an
increasingly fragmented capital market, highlighting the difficulties
of the single European currency. This coincided with a social and
political situation in Greece that continued to be especially critical,
giving rise to a significant risk to have to finally leave the euro. Two
general elections were required before the country was able to
establish a government, and Greece became the first developed
country since the Second World War to restructure its sovereign
debt, forcing private creditors to take a debt haircut.

The actions taken in response to the crisis by the European
authorities halfway through the year brought about a considerable
improvement in the situation, producing an incipient reversal

in the disintegration of the eurozone capital market and some
improvement in the funding position of the systemic countries

on the European periphery. Moreover, fears of a possible exit

by Greece were gradually allayed by the European authorities’
determination to keep the country within the single currency.

In Europe the decision was taken to move more resolutely towards
European integration. A road map was produced setting out the
basic building blocks of financial union, with proposals for greater
economic and fiscal integration being left for implementation in
2013. The first step in building this financial framework will be to
establish a single banking supervisor which will make it possible
for the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to recapitalize the
banks directly, thus breaking the link between financial risk and
sovereign risk.

On the fiscal front, another significant aspect was a certain
shift in the European stance on fiscal consolidation. In particular,
more importance was given to measures to correct fiscal
imbalances, and less on commitments to numerical targets, given
that these were being affected by the difficult economic conditions
then prevailing.

Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to
implement a new programme of bond purchases (outright
monetary transactions, OMT), linked to requests to the ESM by
countries in difficulty for a programme of financial assistance.
The bond purchases must consist mainly of short-dated
government bonds and will not be subject to any quantitative
limits. This decision brought about a fundamental change in the
sovereign debt crisis. By taking this step, the ECB was practically
guaranteeing that no systemic eurozone country would be frozen
out of the primary market for government debt, provided that the
conditionality attaching to the provision of financial assistance by
the ESF was fulfilled.

In late June the Spanish authorities made a request for external
financial assistance for the banking sector as part of their efforts
to restructure and recapitalize the country’s banks. The amount
of financial assistance could be as much as €100 billion and the
conditions on which it would be provided included: (i) determining
the capital requirements of each institution: (ii) recapitalizing,
restructuring and/or resolving the less viable banks; and (iii)
transferring the impaired assets of banks requiring government
support to an asset management company (known as SAREB).

Despite a more benign financial environment in the second half
of the year the global economy remained weak all through 2012,
especially in the eurozone and most particularly in countries on the
European periphery, with countries like Spain and Italy suffering the
consequences of tight credit conditions. In Spain, fiscal tightening
and private sector deleveraging also affected economic activity.

In the United States the economic environment was affected by
uncertainties caused by the difficulty in reaching an agreement over
the fiscal cliff. In Japan, the conflict with China over the Sendaku
islands deepened the economic gloom. The emerging economies
provided yet another headwind to global growth, with contagion from
other countries adding to the effects of domestic tightening in the
main economies as they strove for more balanced growth.

Against this background, the monetary policies of the world’s main
central banks remained highly accommodative, with large amounts
of liquidity being injected into the economy. In the USA, the Federal
Reserve continued its programme of asset purchases and took

a decision to make the setting of interest rates dependent on
numerical threshold levels of unemployment and inflation. The
ECB, in addition to its new bond purchasing programme (OMT)

and its second three-year funding operation, continued to provide
full allotment in its refinancing operations, relaxed its rating
requirements for collateral and reduced its key rate to historically
low levels (0.75%). This highly accommodative monetary policy and
the prevailing risk-adverse conditions ensured that government
bond yields in the core eurozone countries remained close to zero
in the second half of the year, and even entered negative territory
in some cases. The Bank of Japan expanded its unorthodox
monetary programmes, especially by increasing purchases of
government bonds. It also established an inflation target. Finally,
the Bank of England increased its holdings of assets acquired
under its programme of asset purchases and introduced further
unconventional measures (such as providing liquidity to banks
linked to their lending to the private sector).

In the long-term public debt markets US and German bond yields
remained at historically low levels thanks to their status as refuges
for the huge amounts of cash circulating in the market. Spanish
and Italian government debt remained under pressure throughout
the first half of the year, reaching levels which threatened to exclude
Spain and Italy (especially the former) from obtaining funding from
the capital markets,. The second half of the year, however, saw a
substantial improvement, especially after the ECB took a more
prominent role in addressing the sovereign debt crisis. Yields on
the debt of other peripheral countries ended the year at levels
considerably below those prevailing at the beginning of the year.
lreland benefited from expectations of possible restructuring as

a result of the government's bail-out plan for the financial system,
which would ease pressure on the public accounts in that country.
Greek debt found support in factors such as the reduced likelihood
of the country exiting the eurozone, the offer of more generous
bail-out terms, and the relative success of its debt repurchasing
programme. Finally, Portuguese debt benefited from Europe’s
support for its policy of fiscal tightening and subsequent easing.

On the currency markets the euro fell against the dollar on
uncertainties over the single currency. As the year progressed,
measures taken to address European instability and the Fed’s
decision to take further unconventional measures helped the euro
to regain lost ground and to finish the year higher against the dollar.
During the year the yen suffered two major bouts of weakness. The
currency fell between February and March in response to the Bank
of Japan’s more accommodating monetary stance, while in the final
part of the year it was undermined by worsening macroeconomic
data in Japan and the new government's interventionist approach.

Equity markets in the USA and most of the main eurozone
countries registered positive returns at the end of the year despite
the reverses suffered by European stocks in the second quarter
as a result of renewed financial instability in the region. Over the
year as a whole, the Euro Stoxx 50 index rose by 13.8%, while the
Spanish IBEX fell by 4.7%. In the USA, the S&P 500 index managed
to end the year with an 11.4% rise in euro terms.

—Share performance

Banco Sabadell's inclusion in the "zero group" of banks judged
most solvent in the stress tests conducted by consultancy Oliver
Wyman and the positive market reaction to the take-over of Banco
CAM were key factors driving an improved performance by Banco
Sabadell's share price.

In 2012 the share price was dragged down by the weak economic
environment and fears over the position of Spain's financial system,
especially in the early months of the year. Despite the challenging
conditions facing the sector, however, Banco Sabadell's capital-
raising exercise in March was very well received by the market. The
acquisition of Banco CAM was viewed in a very positive light and
enabled Banco Sabadell to consolidate its position as Spain's fourth
largest privately-owned banking group, increase its market share and
secure a more evenly balanced presence in the country.

From June onwards a number of factors helped Banco
Sabadell's share price to break away from the trend by its Spanish
industry peers. The published results of independent audits
carried out on the banking sector, plus the strengthening of Banco
Sabadell’s provisioning and the confirmation of its position as one
of the most solvent banks in the industry were all key contributors
to a stronger share price. This strength was particularly evident
in the months of June and August, when the share price rose
by 20% and 48% respectively. In the latter part of the year the
improved outlook for Spain and the positive assessment of Banco
Sabadell's heads of terms agreement with BMN to take over its
operations in Catalonia and Aragon provided further support for
the share price relative to its domestic market peers.

Banco Sabadell’s capital-raising actions in 2012 included three
new share issues in the months of January, March and July.

Early in December 2011 a decision was taken to make a
buyback offer to the holders of preferred securities issued by
different Banco Sabadell group undertakings and sold to private
individual investors. The preferred securities were to be exchanged
for ordinary shares of Banco Sabadell. The process was completed
on 3 January 2012 with the offer securing a 93.8% acceptance
rate, a clear sign of its popularity among the small investors who
were the main holders of the preferred securities. The result
was to increase the share capital of the Bank by the issue of
223,179,763 new shares (representing 13.83% of its ordinary
share capital). The offer was carried out for the dual purpose of
giving holders of preferred securities the opportunity to liquidate
their holdings and replace them with Banco Sabadell ordinary
shares, while at the same time reinforcing the structure of the
Bank’s capital overall.

An Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company was called
by the Board of Directors of Banco Sabadell to take place on 23
February 2012. The Meeting approved an increase in capital to
be paid in cash, subject to a right of preferential subscription
and to the possibility of the issue not being fully subscribed;
it authorized the Board of Directors to carry out the increase
in capital on any terms it considered expedient, except as
specifically determined by the Meeting.

The subscription period for taking up shares offered in the
increase in capital came to an end on 23 March 2012. The overall
nominal amount of the increase was €85,469,329.13 and the
overall effective amount was €902,556,116.88. The increase
was effected by the issue and allotment of 683,754,633 ordinary
shares, each with a nominal value of €0.125, of the same class
and series as those then in issue.

The main purpose of the increase in capital was to strengthen
the Bank's core capital (i.e. capital and reserves). Although the
Bank's capital resources were compliant with existing capital
adequacy requirements, the increase in capital enabled Banco
Sabadell to strengthen its share capital base and provided it with
additional high-quality capital resources should there ever be a
need to meet stricter capital requirements.

On 26 March trading in the new shares formally commenced
on the Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia stock exchanges via the
Spanish stock exchange’s electronic trading system [mercado
continuo].

At a meeting of the Board of Directors on 13 June 2012 the
Board, in the exercise of powers granted to it by a resolution of
the Annual General Meeting of 31 May 2012, made a decision
to increase the share capital of the Bank by issuing new shares
payable in cash; no right of preferential subscription would apply
to the issue, which was subject to the possibility of not being
fully subscribed. The issue was directed exclusively to all holders
of certain Banco CAM group issues of preferred securities and
subordinated debt willing to accept a public offer for sale of
existing shares, or subscribe for new shares, in Banco Sabadell.

At the end of the offer acceptance period on 27 July 2012
(which achieved a 95.7% acceptance rate), the total number
of shares of the Bank to be issued and sold as a result of the
application by holders of the preferred securities of acash sum
equivalent to 100% of the nominal value of the repurchased
preferred shares, was 678,194,488 (of which 22,000,000 were
treasury shares and 656,194,488 were new shares representing
22.21% of the ordinary share capital of the Bank resulting from
the offer). These new shares were admitted to trading on the stock
exchange's electronic trading system on 13 August 2012.

On the conclusion, on 20 July 2012, of the third period for
the voluntary conversion of mandatorily convertible subordinated
notes issue |/2009, at a meeting of the Board of Directors on 26
July 2012 the Board took a decision to increase the capital of the
Bank by issuing 693,247 new shares to provide funds for voluntary
conversions of the 2,898 subordinated notes comprising issue
1/2009. The new shares were admitted to trading on the electronic
trading system on 13 August 2012.

By 9 November 2012, the end of the second period for the
voluntary conversion of mandatorily convertible subordinated notes
Issue |/2010, issued to be offered in exchange for shares in Banco
Guipuzcoano, S.A. as part of a take-over offer by Banco Sabadell,
applications to convert had been received from a total of 814
noteholders holding 3,925,686 notes which, under the terms of the
issue, were equivalent in value to a total of 4,684,169 shares.

On 14 August 2012 the new shares were admitted to trading
on the Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia stock exchanges via the
electronic trading system [mercado continuo].

At the end of 2012 the number of Banco Sabadell ordinary
shares outstanding as a result of these capital-raising operations
was €2,959.55 million. Of the Bank’s overall shareholder base,
private investors accounted for 70.8% of the share capital, with
institutional investors holding the remaining 29.2%.

Active management of the balance sheet in terms of both
capital adequacy and risk exposure ensured that the surplus of
available capital resources over minimum capital requirements
was maintained. The Bank's capital position and its management
of that position are viewed positively by the market.

Balance sheet management

—A good inflow of new deposits and an active ALM policy
have substantially improved our liquidity position

—A major injection of capital has strengthened our
balance sheet

On 1 June 2012 Banco Sabadell completed the acquisition of
100% of the shares of Banco CAM. A few months later, on 5
December, the merger of Banco CAM by absorption into Banco
Sabadell was officially registered, although the effective date of the
merger for accounting purposes was 1 June 2012. The changes

in the group's financial data for the year 2012 compared with
2011 therefore reflect the wide-ranging impact of the integration of
Banco CAM data during the year.

At the end of 2012 the assets of the Banco Sabadell group
totalled €161,547.1 million, rising by €61,109.7 million compared
with total group assets at 31 December 2011. The annual
increase in percentage terms was 60.8%.

Gross loans and advances to customers excluding reverse
repos totalled €115,392.4 million at 31 December 2012, up from
€73,635.3 million at the close of 2011, a 56.7 % increase. Of the
various components of gross loans and advances, the "secured
loans" category showed the strongest growth, increasing by
€20,865.7 million (up 55.0%).

The loan loss ratio (bad and doubtful loans as a proportion of total
qualifying loans and advances) at the close of 2012 stood at
9.3% — a figure from which assets subject to the Banco CAM
Asset Protection Scheme were excluded. The ratio was again
below the average for the Spanish financial sector as a whole.

In 2012 the Banco Sabadell group saw the value of its investment
portfolio increase by 78.8% compared with the previous year to
reach a year-end total of €25,713.8 million.

Banco Sabadell's portfolio of fixed-income investments is held,
first, as part of its arrangements for macro-hedging the group's
on-balance sheet interest rate risk; second, as a source of interest
returns to boost net interest income, subject always to complying
strictly with the established limits for interest rate risk; and third,
as part of a treasury management strategy of investing cash
surpluses in the securities markets.

The Bank ensures that the credit quality of overall asset positions
held in its fixed-income portfolio is of the highest order and that it
invests in assets with the highest ratings awarded by rating agencies.

Liquidity management and funding

The group's funding policy continued to focus on attracting deposits
and other customer accounts through the branch network. This
strategy was of particular relevance in an operating environment
where the capital markets remained closed for a considerable part of
the year 2012 as the sovereign debt crisis became more acute and
spreads on Spanish government debt over the German Bund climbed
to unprecedented heights, causing widespread uncertainty among
investors in Spain's financial sector. However, the determination of
the European Central Bank (ECB) to ensure the survival of the euro
and its September announcement that it would support any eurozone
country that needed supporting, combined with the publication by
the Bank of Spain, in September, of the results of stress tests carried
out as part of the process of recapitalizing and restructuring of the
Spanish banking industry, caused confidence to return to the capital
markets. The last quarter of the year saw some stabilization of debt
issuance and a tentative reopening of the markets.


--- Page 20 ---

—Ratings awarded to Banco Sabadell debt securities

As far as its wholesale market funding activities were
concerned Banco Sabadell, like the rest of the banking sector, saw
its ratings downgraded by the three major rating agencies, very
largely in response to lower sovereign credit ratings on Spain.

In another development, the Bank completed arrangements
to have its debt rated by the DBRS credit rating agency, and on 31
December 2012 it gave notice that it would not be renewing its
contract with Fitch Ratings as a setter of credit ratings for the group.

The group has a number of short- and long-term funding
programmes in place, giving it a suitable diversity of funding
sources and an appropriate diversity of products, maturities
and investors. Its short-term funding arrangements include a
Spanish commercial paper ("pagaré") issuance programme with
an upper limit of €5,000 million and a Euro Commercial Paper
(ECP) programme with a nominal value of up to €3,500 million.
The commercial paper programme is aimed primarily at domestic
investors and the amount outstanding under the programme
increased during the year, mainly through sales to unqualified
investors. The balance outstanding at 31 December was €3,222
million. The group's ECP programme, aimed at global qualified
investors, saw a modest increase from December 2011, when
there had been no issues outstanding under the ECP programme.
The balance at 31 December 2012 was €37 million.

As part of its longer-term funding, in 2012 Banco Sabadell
issued bonds totalling €3,845 million under its nonparticipating
securities issuance programme, designed for qualified and non-
qualified investors. It also made two public issues of 3-year and
2-year mortgage covered bonds (cédulas hipotecarias) for total
amounts of €1,200 and €500 million, respectively; two issues
of covered bonds underwritten by the European Investment Bank
(EIB) for a total of €295 million with terms of between eight and ten
years, and five issues of straight bonds aimed at the general public
for a total of €1,850 million, with terms of between 12 months and
two years.

In addition to these sources of funds, the Bank holds
a reserve of liquid assets —cash and assets realizable in
the short-term— which would enable it to face any liquidity
contingency. In the course of 2012 Banco Sabadell continued
to strengthen its liquid asset base by generating a positive
funding gap between deposits and loans —more than €15,000
million in 2012— via its branch network, and also by adding new
eligible loans totalling more than €4,150 million to the assets
pledged as collateral under its liquidity facility with the Bank
of Spain. This was made possible, first, by the more relaxed
admissibility criteria for assets eligible as collateral in monetary
policy operations approved by the Bank of Spain on 9 February;

and, second, by the arrangement of a €1,916.1 million loan

to the fund set up by the Spanish government for the purpose
of regularizing payments to suppliers of local and regional
governments. At 31 December Banco Sabadell's eligible liquid
asset base comprised more than €17,500 million in cash and
cash equivalents.

At 31 December Banco Sabadell's net position with the ECB
totalled €23,650 million as a result of the ECB's 3-year liquidity
auctions of 22 December 2011 and 1 March 2012, in which
Banco Sabadell and Banco CAM participated and were allotted
amounts of €4,000 and €7,500 million and €6,000 and €6,150
million respectively.

Banco Sabadell's liquidity management policy seeks to ensure
that its lending can be financed at a reasonable cost and within
a reasonable time so that liquidity risk is kept to a minimum. Its
standard liquidity management procedures are as follows:

—Each year a funding plan is drawn up based on the funding
needs identified for each business unit and the amount to be
raised on the capital markets, spread over a range of long- and
short-term funding programmes.

—Regular checks are made to see that the funding plan is being
adhered to and any deviations from the plan are identified for
each business unit and the funding plan updated accordingly.

—The Bank's short-term commitments, treasury position and
future projections are reviewed periodically to ensure that the
Bank has sufficient liquidity to meet its financing needs in the
long and short term.

—Banco Sabadell regularly updates its liquidity contingency
plan to ensure that it has sufficient liquid assets available to
respond effectively to any liquidity stress scenario that could
arise. At the same time it assesses the quality of its portfolio
of liquid assets by studying the sensitivity of these assets to
different ratings downgrade scenarios.

Profit performance in 2012

Despite the challenging economic and financial conditions, the
Banco Sabadell group ended the year 2012 with a net attributable
profit of €81.9 million after net provisions for loan defaults,
securities revaluations and real estate writedowns amounting

to €2,540.6 million. In the year 2011, when the group's net
attributable profit was €231.9 million, net provisions were
significantly lower at €1,048.9 million.

—A dynamic ALM policy and solid growth in customer
numbers are driving income generation
—Exceptional profits of €2,541 million allocated

in 2012 to boost provisions


--- Page 22 ---

At the close of 2012, net interest income totalled €1,868.0

million, rising by 21.5% on the previous year's figure. The inflow

of income from Banco CAM after June 2012, together with careful
management of interest spreads and an increased contribution from
the group's fixed-income investments helped to offset the negative
effect of the higher cost of borrowing on the capital markets.

Dividends received amounted to €9.9 million, up 12.7%
on 2011's figure of €8.8 million. Profits of equity-accounted
undertakings, on the other hand, were down on the previous year,
partly as a result of the sale of a number of equity holdings (Banco
del Bajio, for example) that had been returning good results.

Net fee and commission income was €628.7 million,
increasing by €55.1 million (up 9.6%) on the year. Income
categories showing particularly good growth were credit card fees,
current account charges and charges for other services.

Net income from trading in 2012 was €546.2 million. Key
contributors to this result included profits of €270.3 million
on disposals of fixed-income assets available for sale, €166.3
million on buybacks of asset-backed securities and redemptions
of securities issued by the group, and €132.2 from trading in
securities. In 2011 net income from trading had included profits
of €139.0 from securities trading and €87.1 million on a debt-for-
equity swap offer in the first quarter of the year (the issue and sale
of 126 million Banco Sabadell shares as part of an offer to buy
back preferred securities and subordinated debt at a discount).

Other operating income and expenses showed a net outflow
of €142.5 million compared with a net inflow of €8.2 million the
previous year. A major expenditure item in 2012 was the group's
€220.3 million contribution to the Bank Deposit Guarantee Fund,
a far higher amount than the €29.8 million paid to the Fund in the
previous year.

Operating expenses for 2012 were €1,511.6 million, of which
€22.2 million were non-recurring. Recurring costs in 2012 were
down 5.9% on a like-for-like basis compared with 2011. The cost:
income ratio with non-recurring costs excluded was 50.3% at the
close of the year.

The resulting operating profit (before impairment and other
provisions) for the year was €1,289.9 million, up 4.8% on the
previous year.

Net provisions for loan losses totalled €1,405.7 million,

a sharp rise on the 2011 figure of €512.4 million. Additional
provisions of €1,134.9 million were also set aside to cover
impairment losses on real estate and financial assets.

Gains realized on asset disposals during the year totalled
€15.4 million. This included the profit from the sale of the Bank's
shareholding in Banco del Bajio. Profits on asset disposals in
2011, at €5.7 million, were considerably lower.

The group's income statement for 2012 includes an income
item of €933.3 million in negative goodwill arising on the
acquisition of Banco CAM.

After deducting income tax and the share of profits attributable
to non-controlling interests, this leaves a net attributable group
profit for the year of €81.9 million, down from €231.9 million in
2011. At the close of 2012 the Tier capital and core capital ratios
stood at 10.4%, both ratios having increased from their year-end
levels in 2011 (9.9% and 9.0% respectively).

Net interest income

Net interest income for the year 2012 totalled €1,868.0 million,
up by 21.5% on the figure for 2011. The increase was due very
largely to the merger of Banco CAM from June 2012. Average
loans and advances to customers were up 29.6% while average
customer deposits also grew, rising by 24.7%.

Interest receivable on loans and advances to customers was
up from 4.05% in 2011 to 4.11% in 2012, an increase of 6 basis
points. On the other hand, capital market funding costs rose by
139 basis points; this was due mainly to the impact of deferred
fair value adjustments to the values of securities acquired as a
result of the take-over of Banco CAM. The cost of deposits and
other customer funds increased by just 2 basis points from 2.04%
in 2011 to 2.06% in 2012.

Interest spreads showed an improvement despite a climate of
falling interest rates, with 3-month Euribor averaging 0.6% over the
year compared with 1.4% in 2011. Skilful management of deposit
and lending rates helped to offset this decline in interest rates, with
the result that interest spreads moved up 4 basis points, rising from
2.01% in 2011 to 2.05% in 2012. However, net interest income
diminished as a proportion of average total assets, falling from
1.6% in 2011 to 1.4% in 2012. This fall was a consequence of the
integration of Banco CAM data, which included a higher proportion of
non-performing assets.

Fees and commissions (net)

Net fee and commission income reached a year-end total of
€628.7 million, up 9.6% on the figure for 2011. This growth was to
a large extent due to the integration of Banco CAM data from June
2012 onwards.

Service-related fees and commissions were up 19.5%, with
credit card fees, payment order fees and other customer service
charges all showing good growth. Fees and commissions related
to loan and guarantee risks were also up on the year before, with
a 10.6% rise that was helped by similar upward shifts in loan-
related charges and in fees chargeable on avals and other bank
guarantees. Management fees on mutual funds and commissions
on sales of pension funds and insurance were down 14.1% overall
on the year, reflecting general market trends over the period.

General administrative expenses

Administrative expenses for the year 2012 were €1,511.6 million,
an increase of 32.0% on the previous year which reflected the
integration of administrative expenses for Banco CAM from June
2012 onwards. Of this €1,511.6 million, €22.2 million were
non-recurring expenses. Recurring expenses in 2012 were down
5.9% on a like-for-like basis compared with the previous year. In
particular, the various measures put in hand as part of the group's
operating efficiency programme, both in branch-level administrative
processes and other areas, resulted in a reduction of 3.9% in like-
for-like personnel expenses. Other recurring administrative costs,
again on a like-for-like basis, showed an even better result, falling by
9.3% compared with the figure for 2011.

—Acquisition
of Banco CAM


--- Page 28 ---

On 7 December 2011 Banco Sabadell made a successful bid for
Banco CAM in a competitive bidding process organized by the Fund
for Orderly Bank Restructuring (Spanish initials: FROB) following
the reorganization of the Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM).

The take-over deal was agreed on financial terms that
included risk limitation provisions. It had a strategic impact as it
substantially extended the Bank's existing franchise in Alicante,
Murcia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands.

The take-over arrangements were drawn up according to
parameters that were set out in the bidding conditions. A contract
containing a promise to carry out a sale and purchase of shares
was concluded by the FROB, the Deposit Guarantee Fund (Spanish
initials: F@D) and Banco Sabadell; and a protocol on the provision
of financial assistance for a restructuring of Banco CAM was
signed by Banco CAM, Banco Sabadell, the FROB and the FGD.

Once all required permissions had been obtained and the
Banco CAM restructuring plan had been approved by the European
Commission, the FGD increased its capital by €2,449 million in
addition to the €2,800 million it had already disbursed and Banco
Sabadell was then able to purchase 100% of the shares of Banco
CAM for the price of one euro.

As a result of the acquisition an Asset Protection Scheme (APS)
came into effect, as agreed in the protocol on financial assistance
for the restructuring of Banco CAM, with retroactive effect as from
31 July 2011. Under the APS, for a specified portfolio of assets
with a gross value of €24,660 million, the FGD would underwrite
80% of all losses on the portfolio for a period of ten years, once all
provisions made in respect of those assets had been absorbed.

—The integration of Banco CAM operations and
systems — one of 2012's major achievements

Banco Sabadell then gave an undertaking, as part of the
approval process, to carry out an integration plan drawn up by
FROB officials. This would involve the closure of 450 branches of
the combined undertaking and staff reductions of approximately
2,200 by 31 December 2013.

In December 2012 Banco CAM, S.A.U. was formally merged by
absorption into Banco de Sabadell; in the same month the process
of business systems integration was completed and the new
SabadellCAM brand was launched.

The SabadellCAM branches have been merged seamlessly with
the rest of the group. The results of the SabadellCAM campaign
in the last quarter of 2012 to generate new business were better
than expected, winning a total of 7,335 new customers and
securing €1,286 million in deposits and other funds.

The Banco CAM acquisition represented a transformative leap
for Banco Sabadell. It enabled the Bank to contemplate a future
that assures it of a place among Spain’s top banking groups, and
this at a crucial time when Spain’s financial system was subjected
to stress and under intense pressure to consolidate.

Banco Sabadell is at the head of Spain's fourth largest privately
owned banking group. The group offers a full range of banking
and financial services through its different financial institutions,
brands, subsidiaries and associates. The group's development
objectives are strongly focused on profitable growth and the
generation of shareholder value through a strategy of business
diversification based on high returns, efficiency and quality of
service together with a conservative risk profile, while maintaining
high standards of ethics and professional conduct combined with
sensitivity to stakeholders' interests.

The Bank has a business model that fosters long-term customer
relationships through constant efforts to promote customer loyalty
and by adopting an initiative-based, proactive approach. The Bank
offers a comprehensive range of products and services, competent,
highly qualified personnel, an IT platform with ample capacity to
support future growth and a relentless focus on quality. The group
has four main areas of business: Commercial Banking; Corporate
Banking and Global Businesses; Markets and Private Banking, and
BS America. It has seven regional divisions with full responsibility for
their areas, and several business-focused support teams.

Commercial Banking

Commercial Banking is the largest of the group's business lines. It
focuses on providing financial products and services to large and
medium-sized businesses, SMEs, retailers and sole proprietors,
professional groupings and other personal customers. Its high
degree of market specialization ensures that customers receive a
personalized service of the highest quality tailored to their needs,
whether from expert staff throughout its extensive branch network
or via other channels that support the customer relationship and
give access to remote banking services.

SabadellAtlantico, the group's flagship brand, operates in most
of the country’s regions except those served by other group brands,
namely: Asturias and Leon, an area served by the group's Banco
Herrero brand; the Basque Country, Navarre and La Rioja, where
the group is represented chiefly through its SabadellGuipuzcoano
network; and the Valencia and Murcia regions, once dominated
by the former Banco CAM, where the group’s brand is now
SabadellCAM. Its SabadellSolbank brand has the primary aim
of meeting the needs of Spanish-resident foreigners from other
European countries. It does this through a chain of specialist
branches operating only in the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands
and the country's southern and south-eastern mainland coastal
areas. Finally, ActivoBank is there to serve customers who prefer to
do their banking exclusively by telephone or online.

Corporate Banking and Global Businesses

Corporate Banking and Global Businesses offers a range of
products and services to large corporates and financial institutions
in Spain and abroad. Its activities embrace corporate banking,
structured finance, corporate finance, development capital,
international trade and consumer finance.


--- Page 32 ---

The Bank’s major clients are served by a team of expert
managers working from its offices in Madrid, Barcelona, London,
Paris and Miami. The group's business model in serving these
clients is based on a comprehensive offering of specialized
financing services and solutions, ranging from cash management
to more sophisticated, tailor-made solutions in such areas as
financing, treasury services and corporate finance.

In the area of structured finance Banco Sabadell has a team
that operates from offices in Madrid, Barcelona, the Basque
country, Miami and New York and has more than 20 years'
experience in originating and structuring deals, whether in the area
of corporate finance or project finance.

Sabadell Corporate Finance is a group subsidiary that
specializes in advising on mergers and acquisitions. It advises
corporate transactions such as company sales and acquisitions,
mergers and MBOs, assists companies in finding new or
replacement partners and provides independent value appraisals.

Banco Sabadell's development capital business focuses on
two main areas: taking temporary equity positions in non-financial
companies; and medium-term investments in energy projects, with
the accent on renewable forms of energy.

In its international business the Bank aims to be present
in the markets that are of most interest to companies actively
engaging in foreign trade. It does this by having a network of
foreign branches, subsidiaries and associates to support its
customers' operations in other countries; it also maintains
working arrangements with more than 2,800 correspondent
banks all over the world, thus providing customers with a further
assurance of genuinely global coverage.

Sabadell Fincom is a group subsidiary specializing in consumer
finance. Its principal business is providing point-of-sale finance for
the leasing or purchase of cars, computer equipment, domestic
appliances, health care accessories and other products.

Markets and Private Banking

Banco Sabadell's Markets and Private Banking division is made up
of several departments, namely SabadellUrquijo Banca Privada;
Investment, Products and Research; Treasury and Capital Markets;
Securities and custodian services; and Bancassurance. With a
service offering that includes research into investment alternatives,
market trading, active wealth management and custodian services,
the division covers all aspects of the investment process that are
regarded as critical by clients who rely on the Bank to manage their
savings.

Markets and Private Banking is well equipped to offer high
value products and services designed to secure the best possible
returns for customers, thanks to optimized investment and
investment management processes that depend on disciplined
analysis and professionalism of a high order.

Constant changes in the regulatory environment are a key
focus of attention for Markets and Private Banking, especially the
rules on investor protection and market transparency introduced
as a result of the European Financial Markets Directive (MiFID).
The Bank has a design and approval process for products and
services which ensures that the full range of offerings available

to customers more than meets their requirements in terms

of quality, returns and appropriateness to market conditions.
Moreover, the constant updating of procedures for investment risk
classification and customer risk profile assessment, coupled with
continuously evolving investment advice and monitoring tools and
methodologies, ensure a high degree of consistency across all
phases of the investment process.

BS America

The BS America operation comprises a number of business units,
associated undertakings and representative offices which together
provide financial services in the corporate banking, private banking
and commercial banking fields. The business is managed from
Miami, where Banco Sabadell has a full-service international
branch which has been in operation since 1993. In the course of
2012 the Bank opened a branch in New York which handles a large
part of the group's structured finance business.

During the year 2012 Banco Sabadell continued to pursue its
aim of consolidating its domestic banking operation in the state
of Florida through its subsidiary Sabadell United Bank. In June it
completed the work of integrating the IT systems of bank branches
acquired as a result of its acquisition of Lydian Private Bank, thus
further strengthening its local banking business in Florida. In the
same month it acquired the assets and liabilities of Banco CAM's
branch in Miami, which were then integrated with those of its
international full-service branch in that city. The Bank thus concluded
its fourth and fifth corporate actions in the state of Florida within a
five-year period that had already seen the acquisition of TransAtlantic
Bank in 2007, the take-over of BBVA's private banking business in
2008 and the purchase of Mellon United National Bank in 2010.

Banco Sabadell retained its interest in Banco BHD, a highly
regarded institution in the Dominican Republic. Its also maintains
representative offices in Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil and the
Dominican Republic for the convenience of customers in the
Americas region.

—Commercial Banking in 2012

In 2012, despite a highly complex operating environment, a major
promotional effort aimed at attracting new customers and deposits
through a strong local branch presence resulted in increased
market shares for the Bank.

Market segments

Companies, businesses, government and local authorities

A key aspect of the work of the Bank's branches in 2012, as
envisaged in the group's current 3-year strategic plan, was the
ongoing campaign to win new customers. During the year 72,981
companies were added as new customers of Banco Sabadell, a
number that was 31.4% up on the previous year's figure. In the
third quarter the SME and large corporate business segments saw
their shares in the division’s overall total reach unprecedented
heights, rising by 8.1% for both customer groups. Especially
noteworthy was the large corporate segment’s share in the total,
which rose to 70.6%, a clear sign of the added value afforded by
the possession of a network of dedicated business branches
which at the end of the year consisted of 71 branches covering
every part the country.

In the business customer segment, acquisition levels were
highly significant and increased the share of this customer group
by 6.5% compared with the previous year. A key element in new
business generation was the "Expansién Negocios" account,

remains fully competitive in terms of both services and cost and
is consequently highly effective as a marketing aid. To make
the management of this large number of new customers more
cost-effective, a customer education programme was put in hand
with the aim of helping customers to develop their multi-channel
abilities and thus enabling them to have more of their commonest
banking needs serviced remotely.

In its approach to public sector customers, the group finalized
a plan for engaging with the public sector which resulted in the
formation of a team of dedicated managers covering all parts
of the country. In 2012 positive results were achieved across
a range of business metrics including increases in customer
numbers and customer funds, which were up by 33.7% and
36.5% respectively compared with the previous year. Another
noteworthy aspect was Banco Sabadell's active participation in
mechanisms set up by the Spanish Government to finance the
country's regional governments and manage their payments
to suppliers: the Regional Liquidity Fund and the Fund for the
Financing of Payments to Suppliers.

All through 2012 the group waged an intense promotional
effort whose primary focus was on attracting deposits and
other funds. The success of this campaign meant that, despite
fierce competition within the banking industry and the prevailing
economic climate, customer funds grew by 9.6% year-on-year,
rising by €1,805.8 million in absolute terms. Key contributors to
this growth were commercial paper (pagarés) and term deposits,
especially the "Lider" 12-month deposit. Key products in the drive
to promote customer loyalty and increase cross-sale ratios were
business and store protection policies, with take-up rates rising by
29.6% compared with the previous year. In working capital finance
the group decided to anticipate new SEPA regulations due to come
into effect in 2014 by introducing two new products, B2B and Core
Direct Debits, which provide further safeguards for customers in
their business transactions. For another year more specialized
forms of financing such as factoring and "confirming" (discounted
payments of invoices presented by a customer's named suppliers),
particularly in cross-border transactions, provided customers with
additional solutions for their global collections and payments.

One area deserving of special mention is the group's firm
commitment to e-commerce. During the year a special unit
was set up to be a source of expertise with a mission to drive
innovation and give advice and support to business customers
entering the world of online selling.

Support of another kind was offered to customers in the
form of solutions to help them meet their funding and liquidity
requirements. During the year numerous agreements were made
with official agencies at central government and regional level,
under which the Bank was able to provide a total of €1,565.0
million in loan finance. A very similar area of business that
generated much activity during the year was the provision of
finance to businesses and sole traders under Official Credit
Institute-sponsored schemes, in which the Bank achieved a 12.2%
share, putting it in third place among participating banks and
improving its ranking by two notches compared with the previous
year. The ICO funding schemes with the highest take-up were ICO
Liquidez and ICO Inversion, with disbursements totalling €752.3
million and €557.8 million respectively. The Bank was also the

top provider of finance under the ICO Exportadores, ICO Garantia
SGR and ICO Emprendedores funding schemes, in which its shares
were 88.0%, 35.7% and 31.9% respectively.

The Bank also continued to work tirelessly to promote
international trade and offer guidance to businesses. As part of
this effort it organized a series of foreign trade seminars that were
attended by over 2,100 firms. The "Exportar para crecer" [Export
to grow] programme, an innovative combination of products and
training events designed to meet customers’ exporting needs, was
launched during the year. Activities of this kind confirmed Banco
Sabadell's position as a key supplier of services for foreign trade,
both to existing and potential customers. An indication of this was
the growth in its share of the export and import documentary credit
businesses compared with 2011, with year-end market shares of
24.3% and 14.1% respectively.

In 2012 Banco Sabadell was once again a leading provider of
medium- and long-term finance, especially in the areas of leasing,
sale-and-leaseback, marine finance and finance for expansion
and renewing plant and equipment. One indication of this was an
18.0% rise in the group's plant and equipment leasing business
with its focus on energy-efficiency, in which it was a major market
player. In the area of leasing, the launch of a special product for
franchises to help franchisees obtain access to credit was a
noteworthy development.

The last month of the year saw a further progress in
implementing the group’s policy of focusing on particular market
segments, with two highly targeted sales teams being set up:
one dedicated to businesses in market segments related to
the tourist/holiday industry, and one focused exclusively on
institutional clients.

Individual customers

The year 2012 was of special significance for the Bank's goal, as
set out in its current 3-year strategic plan, of perfecting its growth
strategy for the individual customer segment. Record figures for
customer growth were achieved for the second year in succession
as new customers reached a total of more than 338,800, an
increase of 18.2% on the figure for 2011. At the same time, the full
integration of the Banco CAM group, the market leader in serving
the needs of individual customers in the regions of Valencia and
Murcia, resulted in Banco CAM’s two million-strong customer base
being transferred to Banco Sabadell.
