Financial performance and position Sustainability

The Hafslund restructuring was concluded in the fourth quarter
and the new business structure is in place. Together with our new
colleagues from Hafslund, we have updated the strategies for both
our Consumer Solutions and City Solutions divisions. We have now
set the path forward and will be working together on implementing
the strategy. We target annual synergies of EUR 15-20 million by
the end of 2020.

In line with our strategy, we are not only focusing on taking
part in the European power sector consolidation, we are also
investing in new renewable generation and targeting a gigawatt-
scale portfolio of wind and solar power. In January 2018 we
commissioned Russia’s first industrial wind power site with
a capacity of 35 MW. In addition, we have recently started the
implementation of other wind power plants in the Nordics and
Russia and invested in solar power in Russia, and commissioned
our largest solar power plant in India.

In the fourth quarter our performance improvement was broad-
based, with comparable operating profit increasing in all operative
segments. The Generation, City Solutions and Russia segments
continued to perform well, while the Consumer Solutions segment
continues to be under pressure due to the tight competitive
situation. The acquisitions of Ekokem and Hafslund are already
impacting our results positively, further strengthened by our
continued Fortum-wide focus on efficiency. We have now reached
the targeted EUR 100 million savings in fixed costs announced in
2016. The cost savings have enabled us to invest in new ventures
for the future. Going forward we will continue to focus on cost
efficiency and investment prioritisation.

Sustainability and safety continue to be very important
for us at Fortum. 2017 was a challenging year in terms of
occupational safety. We did not reach our targets for lost workday
injury frequency, especially for contractors. This was a clear
disappointment, even though we succeeded in reducing the number
of severe accidents to only one. We continue to be committed to
keeping our promise to provide a safe workplace for all. In 2017, our
CO: emissions decreased slightly. Our specific emissions remained
at the same level as the previous year and continue to be at a low
level compared to other European power producers.

Risk management

Fortum share and shareholders

As the strategy implementation and capital redeployment
continues, our dividend payment capability will be further
strengthened. Fortum’s Board of Directors is proposing an
unchanged dividend of EUR 1.10 per share for the calendar year
2017. Our ambition is to pay a stable, sustainable and over time
increasing dividend now and in the future, and given the prevailing
market conditions, our goal is to avoid a temporary dividend cut.

Uniper investment

In September 2017, Fortum announced it had signed a transaction
agreement with E.ON under which E.ON had the right to decide

to tender its 46.65% shareholding in Uniper SE into Fortum’s
public takeover offer. In November, Fortum launched a voluntary
public takeover offer to all Uniper shareholders at a total value of
EUR 22 per share implying a premium of 36% to the price prior to
intense market speculation on a potential transaction at the end of
May. The offer is subject to competition and regulatory approvals.
Already in October 2017, Fortum received approval from the US
competition authorities. Fortum expects to finalise the transaction
in mid-2018.

The investment in Uniper delivers on Fortum’s previously
announced capital redeployment strategy and investment
criteria. Uniper’s businesses are well aligned with Fortum’s core
competencies, are close to Fortum’s home markets and are highly
cash generative. Fortum expects the investment to deliver an
attractive return that will support the company in accelerating
the development and implementation of sustainable energy
technologies, without sacrificing a competitive dividend.

The offer will be financed with existing cash resources and
committed credit facilities, with Barclays Bank PLC originally
underwriting 100% of the credit facilities, including ongoing
liquidity requirements. In October the credit facilities were
syndicated to selected relationship banks of Fortum. Dividends
received from the stake in Uniper will contribute to a stable and
sustainable dividend for Fortum’s shareholders. Fortum will
account for Uniper as an associated company unless control
according to IFRS is attained; as such, EBITDA and cash flow
contribution, as well as the EPS effect on Fortum’s results, will

aap

depend on the final outcome of the offer. As a result of this
transaction, Fortum’s leverage will rise above our given guidance
for net debt/EBITDA level of around 2.5x. Over time however,
Fortum expects its cash generation in combination with the
dividend from Uniper to reduce this level towards the stated target.
In January 2018, Fortum announced that shareholders
representing 46.93% of the shares in Uniper had accepted the
offer during the initial acceptance period, including E.ON. Uniper
shareholders who have not tendered their shares to the offer within
the initial acceptance period can still tender during the additional
acceptance period that began on 20 January 2018 and ending on
2 February 2018. Fortum expects to publish the total amount of
shares tendered on 7 February 2018.

Hafslund transaction
On 26 April 2017, Fortum and the City of Oslo entered into an
agreement to restructure their ownership in Hafslund ASA, one of
the largest listed power groups in the Nordic region. On 4 August
2017, Fortum concluded the restructuring of the ownership in
Hafslund. Fortum sold its 34.1% stake in Hafslund ASA to the
City of Oslo, acquired 100% of Hafslund Markets AS and 50.0% of
Hafslund Varme AS (renamed as Fortum Oslo Varme AS) including
the City of Oslo’s waste-to-energy company Klemetsrudanlegget
AS (renamed as Fortum Oslo Varme KEA AS), and 10% of Hafslund
Produksjon Holding AS.

The total debt-free price of the acquisitions was
EUR 940 million. The combined net cash investment of the
transactions, including the dividend received in May 2017, was
EUR 230 million. Fortum booked a one-time tax-free sales gain in
its 2017 results, totalling EUR 324 million, which corresponds to
EUR 0.36 earnings per share. Transaction costs of EUR 4 million
for the acquisitions were included in Items affecting
comparability. The acquired businesses were consolidated into
Fortum Group from 1 August 2017.

For further information see} Note 5 Segment reporting,

In 2017, sales were EUR 4,520 (3,632) million. The increase was
mainly due to the strengthening Russian rouble and the
consolidation of Ekokem, Hafslund and DUON. Comparable
EBITDA totalled EUR 1,275 (1,015) million. Comparable operating
profit totalled EUR 811 (644) million. Comparable operating profit
was positively impacted by the consolidation of Hafslund, higher
achieved power prices, lower real estate and capacity taxes in
Swedish nuclear and hydro power plants and by improved result in
the Russian operations. Operating profit totalled EUR 1,158 (633)
million. Fortum’s operating profit for the period was impacted by
items affecting comparability of EUR 347 (-11) million, including
updated provisions, sales gains, transaction costs and the IFRS
accounting treatment (IAS 39) of derivatives mainly used for
hedging, as well as nuclear fund adjustments (p Note 5). The sales
gains include a one-time tax-free sales gain of EUR 324 million
from the divestment of the 34.1% stake in Hafslund ASA
(Note 38).

In 2017, Fortum reached the targeted EUR 100 million savings
in fixed costs announced in 2016. At the same time, the cost
spend has been shifted to businesses under development and new
ventures.

The share of profit from associates and joint ventures was
EUR 148 (131) million, of which Hafslund represented
EUR 39 (51) million, TGC-1 EUR 32 (38) million and Fortum Varme
EUR 66 (66) million. The share of profit from Hafslund is based on
the company’s published fourth-quarter 2016 and January-June
2017 interim reports. The share of profit from TGC-1 is based on the
company’s published fourth-quarter 2016 and January-September

2017 interim reports (» Note 18). Due to the restructuring of
Hafslund and the divestment of Fortum’s 34.1% share in the
company, Fortum will no longer have share of profits from
Hafslund ASA.

Net finance costs amounted to EUR 195 (169) million,
including costs relating to financing arrangements for the Uniper
transaction.

Profit before income taxes was EUR 1,111 (595) million.

Taxes for the period totalled EUR 229 (90) million. The effective
income tax rate according to the income statement was 20.6%
(15.2%). The comparable effective income tax rate, excluding the
impact of the share of profit from associated companies and joint
ventures as well as non-taxable capital gains and other major
one-time income tax effects, was 18.8% (20.0%) (Note 12).

The profit for the period was EUR 882 (504) million. Earnings
per share were EUR 0.98 (0.56), of which EUR -0.14 per share was
related to a Swedish income tax case and EUR 0.38 (-0.02) per share
was related to items affecting comparability (} Note 6 and
»Note 36).

Cash flow
In 2017, net cash from operating activities increased by
EUR 372 million to EUR 993 (621) million, due to a EUR 260 million
increase in comparable EBITDA, a EUR 193 million decrease in
realised foreign exchange gains and losses, a EUR 133 million
decrease in income taxes paid and a EUR 183 decrease in working
capital compared to the previous year. The foreign exchange gains
and losses of EUR -83 (110) million relate to the rollover of foreign
exchange contract hedging loans to Russian and Swedish
subsidiaries. In June 2016, Fortum paid income taxes in Sweden
totalling EUR 127 million regarding an ongoing tax dispute. The
change in working capital in 2017 was EUR 81 (-102) million. The
biggest impact was the effect of the daily cash settlements for
futures in Nasdaq OMX Commodities Europe
() Additional cash flow information).

Investments excluding acquisitions increased by EUR 58 million
to EUR 657 (599) million compared to the previous year.
Acquisition of shares amounted to EUR 972 (695) million mainly

Market conditions

Nordic countries
According to preliminary statistics, electricity consumption in the
Nordic countries was 392 (390) terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2017.

At the beginning of 2017, the Nordic water reservoirs were
at 75 TWh, which is 8 TWh below the long-term average and 23
TWh lower compared to the previous year. At the end of 2017,
the reservoirs were 86 TWh, which is 3 TWh above the long-
term average and 11 TWh higher compared to the previous year.
Precipitation in the Nordics, was clearly above the normal level both
in the fourth quarter and during the full year 2017.

The average system spot price in Nord Pool for the year 2017 was
EUR 29.4 (26.9) per MWh, and the average area price in Finland was
EUR 33.2 (32.4) per MWh and EUR 31.2 (29.2) per MWh in Sweden

(SE3, Stockholm). The main driver for the price increase was the
clearly higher marginal cost of coal condensing power, which has
contributed to stronger continental prices and increased exports
from the Nordics.

In Germany, the average spot price in 2017 increased to
EUR 34.2 (29.0) per MWh.

The market price of CO: emission allowances (EUA) increased
from EUR 6.5 per tonne at the beginning of the year to EUR 8.2 per
tonne at the end of 2017.

Russia

Fortum operates both in the Tyumen and Khanty-Mansiysk area
of Western Siberia, where industrial production is dominated by
the oil and gas industries, and in the Chelyabinsk area of the Urals,
which is dominated by the metal industry. The Russian market is
divided in two price zones and Fortum operates in the First Price
Zone.

Russian electricity consumption in 2017 was 1,035 (1,027)
TWh and the corresponding figure for the First Price Zone was
799 (787) TWh.

In 2017, the average electricity spot price, excluding capacity
price, was unchanged at RUB 1,204 (1,204) per MWh in the First
Price Zone.

European business environment
and carbon market

Revision of the EU ETS approved
After two and a half years of legislative processing the revision of
the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) for the period 2021-2030
was adopted in December. The new rules will increase the annual
emission reduction target of the ETS from the current 1.74% to
2.2%. From the carbon market balance and pricing perspective the
essential improvement is the strengthening of the Market Stability
Reserve (MSR), including a temporary doubling of the intake rate
from 12% to 24% during 2019-2023 and cancellation of allowances
from the reserve from 2023 onwards. In addition, the new directive
includes a provision for voluntary cancellation of allowances from
the market.

However, the agreed setup is not yet in line with the Paris
Climate Agreement and meets only the lower end of the EU 2050
goal to reduce emissions by 80-95% by 2050.

Swedish hydropower legislation
In June, the Swedish Government released a proposal on revision
of hydro legislation including changes in the Environmental
Act. This is a follow-up of the Swedish energy agreement done
in summer 2016 and includes adjustments to meet requirements
based on the EU Water Framework Directive. The aim is to
mitigate environmental impacts and facilitate more efficient
power production. According to the proposal, environmental
permits for hydropower should be revised during a 20-year period
in accordance with a national plan for prioritisation. The Ministry
of Environment aims to have the revised legislation in place in
March 2018.

Fortum emphasises the need to reform the Swedish system
for hydro management. However, the proposal fails in ensuring
a fair balance between environmental improvements and power
production and a reasonable level of legal certainty.

The energy agreement requires hydro power companies to
carry the full cost of environmental improvements. The largest
hydro power companies are planning a joint fund in order to

secure financing for the improvements. The fund is expected to
be in operation from July 2018 provided that the revision of hydro
legislation has been completed.

Swedish nuclear waste fund fee approved

In December, the Swedish Government decided on the waste fund
fees for the period 2018-2020. The fees are based on a new structure
with a calculated lifetime of 50 years and on parts of the funds
capital being invested in shares.

Swedish nuclear and hydro taxes adopted

In May, the Swedish Parliament adopted the proposed changes of
nuclear and hydropower taxation in accordance with the energy
agreement from June 2016. Starting from 1 July 2017, the tax on
installed effect in nuclear reactors decreased by 90%, from SEK
14,770/MW/month to SEK 1,500/MW/month, and on 1 January
2018 the tax was abolished. The hydropower real-estate tax will be
reduced from 2.8% to 0.5% in four steps by 2020.

Development of Nordic energy cooperation
Development of regional energy cooperation in the Nordic

context moved forward in 2017. Following the June 2017 report by
independent investigator Jorma Ollila, the Nordic energy ministers
discussed the report in their annual meeting in November.

They agreed on next-step actions to implement these proposals,
including a proposal to establish a Nordic electricity market

forum comprising various actors in the sector to discuss topics
particularly related to development of the Nordic regional power
market.

customer business or other purchases.

2) Power plants are often built jointly with other power producers, and owners
purchase electricity at cost including interest cost and production taxes. The share
of profit/loss is mainly IFRS adjustments (e.g. accounting for nuclear-related assets
and liabilities) and depreciations on fair-value adjustments from historical

ions (b Note 18).

In 2017, the Generation segment’s total power generation in
the Nordic countries was 44.2 (45.3) TWh. CO,-free production
accounted for 99% (99%) of the total production.

Comparable EBITDA increased to EUR 603 (527) million.
Comparable operating profit improved to EUR 478 (417) million.
The increase was mainly related to the higher achieved power
price, and lower real-estate and capacity taxes in Swedish hydro
and nuclear power plants, and was partly offset by lower nuclear
production volumes resulting from the closure of Oskarshamn 1
and lower nuclear availability.

Operating profit clearly increased to EUR 501 (338) million and
was positively affected by EUR 23 (-79) million of the IFRS
accounting treatment (IAS 39) of derivatives mainly used for
hedging Fortum’s power production, updated provisions, and by
nuclear fund adjustments (> Note 5).

Consumer Solutions comprises electricity and gas retail businesses

in the Nordics and Poland, including the customer service, invoicing
and debt collection business. Fortum is the largest electricity retail
business in the Nordics, with approximately 2.5 million customers
across different brands in Finland, Sweden, Norway and Poland. The
business provides electricity and related value-added products as well

On 4 August 2017, Fortum concluded the restructuring of its
ownership in Hafslund. Hafslund Markets has been consolidated
into the results of Consumer Solutions as of 1 August 2017

Electricity and gas sales volumes totalled 24.4 (14.8) TWh. The
total customer base at the end of the period was 2.49 (1.36) million.

Sales increased to EUR 1,097 (668) million, mainly due to the
consolidation of Polish DUON and Hafslund.

Comparable EBITDA amounted to EUR 57 (55) million
and comparable operating profit was EUR 41 (48) million. The
consolidation of Hafslund had a positive effect of EUR 22 million
on the comparable EBITDA and EUR 13 million on the comparable
operating profit. The result improvement was offset by the lower
average margin in electricity and gas products and higher costs
arising from the increased focus and spend on the development of
new digital services. The renegotiated invoicing service agreements
for external distribution companies also had a negative impact on
the results.

Fortum share and shareholders

After the completion of the multi-year investment programme

in March 2016, Fortum’s total capacity in Russia amounts to

4,794 MW, including 35 MW of solar power acquired at the end of
2017. The generation capacity built after the year 2007 amounts

to 2,333 MW. Under the Russian Capacity Supply Agreement (CSA
— “new capacity”) this capacity entitles Fortum to guaranteed
payments for approximately ten years after the commissioning of
each new unit. The received capacity payments vary depending on
age, location, type and size of the plant, as well as on seasonality
and availability. The CSA payments can also vary somewhat on an
annual basis, as they are linked to Russian Government long-term
bonds with eight to ten years maturity.

In March 2017, the System Administrator of the wholesale
market published its annual data which is the basis for the CSA
payment calculation. These components comprise among others
the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), the consumer
price index (CPI) and re-examination of earnings from the
electricity-only (spot) market (done every three and six years
after commissioning ofa unit). Fortum’s CSA payment for 2017
was revised upwards to compensate for lower earnings from the
electricity-only market. In addition, certain power plants were
entitled to higher CSA payments when entering into the seven-
to-ten year time period of generation. The increase of the CSA
payment was somewhat offset by lower Government bond rates and
consumer price index (CPI).

Fortum’s Russian capacity generation, totalling 2,461 MW, was
allowed to participate in the Competitive Capacity Selection (CCS
—“old capacity”) for 2017. All Fortum plants offered in the auction
were selected. Fortum has obtained forced mode status for 195 MW

ofits capacity, i.e. it receives higher-rate capacity payments.

In 2017, the Russia segment’s power sales volumes amounted
to 30.5 (29.5) TWh and heat sales volumes totalled 19.8 (20.7)
TWh. The power volumes increased due to commissioning of the
Chelyabinsk GRES unit 3.

43>

Sales increased to EUR 1,101 (896) million, mainly supported
by the strengthening of the Russian rouble, higher received CSA
payments, the change in the heat supply scheme in Tyumen and
commissioning of the Chelyabinsk GRES unit 3.

The Russia segment’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 438 (312)
million and the comparable operating profit was EUR 296 (191)
million. The Russian rouble had a positive effect of EUR 31 million.
The commissioning of the new unit, higher received CSA payments,
higher power volumes, as well as improved bad-debt collections
also affected the results positively.

Operating profit was EUR 295 (226) million, including sales
gains of EUR 0 (35) million (p Note 5).

The share of profits from associated companies and joint
ventures totalled EUR 31 (38) million (} Note 18).

Russia

On 27 April 2017, Fortum and RUSNANO, a Russian state-owned
development company, signed a 50/50 investment partnership
(joint venture) in order to secure the possibility ofa Russian
Capacity Supply Agreement (CSA) wind portfolio. In June,

1,000 MW of the bids of the Fortum-RUSNANO wind investment
fund were selected in the Russian renewable energy auction. The
bids were for projects to be commissioned during 2018-2022
witha price corresponding to approximately EUR 115-135 per
MWh. The projects will be covered by CSA fora period of 15 years.
The investment decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis
within the total mandate of the wind investment fund. Fortum’s
equity stake in the wind investment fund totals a maximum of
RUB 15 billion (currently approximately EUR 220 million). The
amount is to be invested over time (approx. 5 years), subject to
separate investment decisions. The investment fund has selected
Vestas as the supplier of wind turbines in Russia. In October 2017,

the wind investment fund made an investment decision on the first
50-MW wind farm. The wind farm is expected to start production
during the first half of 2019.

In November 2017, Fortum completed the replacement
investment at the Chelyabinsk GRES power plant. The new
combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) unit with 247.5 MW of
electricity generation capacity and 174 MW of heat capacity started
commercial operation. The new turbine replaces the previous eight
turbine generators in the power plant. This unit is not within the
scope of the previously completed larger investment programme
and consequently receives Competitive Capacity Selection (CCS)
payments. Fortum’s Chelyabinsk GRES site has electricity generation
capacity of 742 MW and heat production capacity of 988 MW.

On 30 November 2017, Fortum signed an agreement to
acquire three solar power companies from Hevel Group, Russia’s
largest integrated solar power company. The transaction was
closed in December 2017. All three power plants are operational
with a total capacity of 35 MW. The plants will receive Capacity
Supply Agreement (CSA) payments for approximately 15 years
after commissioning at an average CSA price corresponding to
approximately EUR 430/MWh. The plants were commissioned
in 2016 and 2017. Hevel Group will provide operation and
maintenance services for all three power plants.

Other
In January 2017, Fortum finalised the acquisition of three wind
power projects from the Norwegian company Nordkraft. The
transaction consists of the Nygardsfjellet wind farm, which is
already operational, as well as the fully-permitted Anstadblaheia and
Sorfjord projects. The wind farms are expected to be commissioned
in 2018 and 2019. When built, the total installed capacity of the three
wind farms will be approximately 170 MW. On 29 September 2017,
Fortum announced the decision to invest in the Sorfjord wind farm in
northern Norway. The Sorfjord wind park will have 23 wind turbines
with a total capacity of 97 megawatts. The wind turbines for Sorfjord
will be delivered by Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy.

In March 2017, Fortum commissioned the 70-MW solar plant
at Bhadla solar park in Rajasthan, India and in December 2017

Key drivers and risks
Fortum’s financial results are exposed to a number of economic,
strategic, political, financial and operational risks.

One of the key factors influencing Fortum’s business
performance is the wholesale price of electricity in the Nordic
region. The key drivers behind the wholesale price development in
the Nordic region are the supply-demand balance, the prices of fuel
and CO; emission allowances, and the hydrological situation.

The world economy has recently been growing at an increasing
pace. The overall economic growth impacts commodity and CO;
emission allowance prices, which has an effect on the Nordic
wholesale price of electricity. In Fortum’s Russian business, the key
drivers are economic growth, the rouble exchange rate, regulation
around the heat business, and the further development of the
electricity and capacity markets. In all regions, fuel prices and power
plantavailability also impact profitability. In addition, increased
volatility in exchange rates due to financial turbulence could have
both translation and transaction effects on Fortum’s financials,
especially through the Russian rouble and Swedish krona.

In the Nordic countries, the regulatory and fiscal environment
for the energy and environmental management sectors has also
added risks for companies. The main strategic risk is that the
regulatory and market environment develops in a way that we
have not been able to foresee and prepare for. In response to these
uncertainties, Fortum has analysed and assessed a number of
future energy market and regulation scenarios, including the
impact of these on different generation forms and technologies.
Asa result, Fortum’s strategy was renewed in 2016 to include
broadening the base of revenues and diversification into new
businesses, technologies and markets. The environmental
management business is based on the framework and
opportunities created by environmental regulation. Being able to
respond to customer needs created by the tightening regulation is a
key success factor.

review and > Note 3 Financial risk management.

Outlook

Nordic market

Electricity is expected to continue to gain a higher share of total
energy consumption. Electricity demand in the Nordic countries
is expected to grow by approximately 0.5% on average, while the
growth rate for the next few years will largely be determined by
macroeconomic developments in Europe, and especially in the
Nordic countries.

The price of oil and coal in 2017, was on a clearly higher
level compared to the previous year. The price of CO2 emission
allowances (EUA) also increased during the fourth quarter of 2017.
The price of electricity for the upcoming 12 months decreased in
the Nordics due to a stronger hydrological balance but increased in
Germany due to higher fuel prices.

Late in January 2018, the forward quotation for coal (ICE
Rotterdam) for the remainder of 2018 was around USD 88 per
tonne and the market price for CO; emission allowances for 2018
around EUR 8.90 per tonne. The Nordic system electricity forward
price at Nasdaq Commodities for the remainder of 2018 was
around EUR 27 per MWh and for 2019 around EUR 26 per MWh.
In Germany, the electricity forward price for the remainder of 2018
and 2019 was around EUR 35 per MWh. Nordic water reservoirs
were about 2 TWh below the long-term average, and were 7 TWh
higher than a year earlier.

Generation

‘The Generation segment's achieved Nordic power price typically
depends on such factors as hedge ratios, hedge prices, spot

prices, availability and utilisation of Fortum’s flexible production
portfolio, and currency fluctuations. Excluding the potential effects
from changes in the power generation mix, a 1 EUR/MWh change
in the Generation segment’s Nordic power sales achieved price

will result in an approximately EUR 45 million change in Fortum’s
annual comparable operating profit. Achieved power price includes
also the results of optimization of Fortum’s hydro and nuclear

production as well as operations in the physical and financial
commodity markets.

Asa result of the nuclear stress tests in the EU, the Swedish
Radiation Safety Authority (SSM) has decided on new regulations
for Swedish nuclear reactors. For the operators, this means that
safety investments should be in place no later than 2020.

The process to review the Swedish nuclear waste fees is done ina
three-year cycle. The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management
Co (SKB) has updated the new technical plan including earlier
shut down of some nuclear plants for the SSM to review. The final
decision on the new nuclear waste fees for years 2018-2020 was
made by the Swedish Government in December 2017 and was in
line with SSM’s proposal to the Government. On 25 October 2017,
the Swedish Parliament decided on changes in the legal framework
impacting calculations of nuclear waste fees and the investment
of the nuclear waste fund. In the revised legal framework the
assumed operating time for calculating the waste fee is 50 years, as
opposed to the previous assumption of 40 years. The fund is now
also allowed to invest in other financial instruments in addition to
bonds. Based on these changes the annual waste fees for Fortum
will increase by approximately EUR 8 million.

On 3 July 2017, Fortum announced the decision by the
Administrative Court in Stockholm, Sweden, related to Fortum
Sverige AB’s hydro production-related real-estate tax assessments
for the years 2009-2014. The Court decided in Fortum’s favour. The
disputed amount for the five years was a total of SEK 508 million
(EUR 52 million). Fortum will book the tax income (subject to
income tax) only after the legal decision has entered into force.
Hydropower plants have been subject to a real-estate tax rate that
has resulted in an approximately 12 times higher real-estate tax per
kWh compared to any other production, due to different tax rates
and different valuation factors. The tax authority has appealed the
decision.

In October 2016, the Swedish Energy Agency presented a
concrete proposal on how to increase the production of renewable
electricity by 18 TWh in 2020-2030 within the electricity certificate

q7>

system, as part of the Energy Agreement. In April 2017, the Swedish
Government decided that the increase will be carried out ina linear
manner.

In September 2016, the Swedish Government presented the
budget proposal for the coming years. One of the key elements was
the proposal that the taxation of different energy production forms
should be more equal, and the tax burden of nuclear and hydro
should be taken to the level of other production technologies. The
budget states that the nuclear capacity tax will be reduced to 1,500
SEK/MW per month from 1 July 2017 and abolished on 1 January
2018. Asa result, the tax for Fortum decreased by EUR 32 million
due to the tax decrease and by another EUR 5 million due to the
premature closure of Oskarshamn 1 in the middle of the year. In
2017, the capacity tax was EUR 52 million. In 2018, there is no
capacity tax. As stated in the Government’s budget, the hydropower
real-estate tax will decrease from 2.8% to 0.5%; the tax will be
reduced in four steps: in January 2017 to 2.2%; in January 2018 to
1.6%; in January 2019 to 1.0%; and in January 2020 to 0.5%. In 2017,
the tax for Fortum decreased by EUR 20 million to EUR 95 million.
In addition to the decrease in the tax rate, the hydropower real-
estate tax values, which are linked to electricity prices, will be
updated in 2019. The real-estate tax values are updated every six
years. With the current low electricity prices, the tax values in
2019 would be clearly lower than today. The process for renewing
existing hydro permits will also be reformed.

In 2015, the Swedish OKG AB decided to permanently
discontinue electricity production at Oskarshamn’s nuclear plant
units 1 and 2. Unit 1 was shut down on 17 June 2017, approximately
2weeks earlier than planned, and unit 2 has been out of operation
since June 2013. The closing processes for both units are estimated
to take several years.

City Solutions

In City Solutions, stable growth, cash flow and earnings are
achieved through investments in new plants and through
acquisitions. Fuel cost, availability, flexibility and efficiency as
well as gate fees are key drivers in profitability, but also the power
supply/demand balance, electricity price and the weather affect
profitability.

In May 2016, the Finnish Government decided to increase
the tax on heating fuels by EUR 90 million annually from 2017
onwards. The negative impact on Fortum is estimated to be
approximately EUR 5 million per year.

The development of acquired business operations of Fortum
Oslo Varme is estimated to require integration-related one-time
costs and increased investments over the coming years. The
realisation of cost synergies are estimated to gradually start
materialising from 2019 onwards with targeted annual synergies of
EUR 5-10 million expected to be achieved by the end of 2020.

Consumer Solutions

After the acquisition of Hafslund Markets in August, a new business
strategy for Consumer Solutions, was approved by the Fortum
Board of Directors in December. The strategic objective is to
establish Consumer Solutions as the leading consumer business in
the Nordics, with a customer-centric multi-brand structure.

Competition in the Nordic electricity retail market is expected
to remain challenging, with continued pressure on sales margins
and increasing customer churn. To counter the market challenges
and create a solid foundation for competitive operations, Consumer
Solutions will increase its resources and cost spend on developing
new digital services for consumers.

The combined Hafslund Markets and Fortum Markets business,
while largely complementary, have identified synergy potential, in
terms of both revenue and costs. The short-term priority will be on
achieving identified revenue synergies by leveraging established
best practices and providing additional products and services to
the whole customer base. The realisation of cost synergies will

start materialising once the integration of Hafslund Markets is
completed, expected from 2019, with cost synergy realisation
gradually increasing over the coming years, and targeted annual
synergies of approximately EUR 10 million to be achieved by the
end of 2020.

Russia

The Russia segment’s new capacity generation built after 2007
under the Russian Capacity Supply Agreement (CSA) has been a

key driver for earnings growth in Russia, as it receives considerably
higher capacity payments than the old capacity. Fortum will receive
guaranteed capacity payments for a period of approximately

10 years from the commissioning ofa plant. The received CSA
payment will vary depending on the age, location, size and type of
the plants, as well as on seasonality and availability. CSA payments
can vary somewhat annually because they are linked to Russian
Government long-term bonds with 8 to 10 years maturity. In
addition, the regulator will review the earnings from the electricity-
only market three and six years after the commissioning of a unit
and could revise the CSA payments accordingly. Furthermore, the
level of the CSA payments increases starting from the seventh year
of the 10-year period.

InJune 2017, 1,000 MW of the bids of the 50/50-owned Fortum-
RUSNANO wind investment fund were selected in the Russian
wind auction. The bids are for projects to be commissioned during
the years 2018-2022 with a price corresponding to approximately
EUR 115-135 per MWh. The projects will be covered by CSA fora
period of 15 years.

The long-term Competitive Capacity Selection (CCS) for the
years 2017-2019 was held at the end of 2015, the CCS for the year
2020 in September 2016, and the CCS for the year 2021 in September
2017. All Fortum plants offered in the auction were selected. Fortum
also obtained forced mode status, i.e. it receives payments for the
capacity at a higher rate for some of the “old capacity”. For the years
2017-2019, forced mode status was obtained for 195 MW; for the
year 2020, 175 MW, and for the year 2021, 105 MW.

dis >

In December 2017, Fortum acquired three solar power
companies from Hevel Group, Russia’s largest integrated solar
power company. All three power plants are operational and
will receive CSA payments for approximately 15 years after
commissioning at an average CSA price corresponding to
approximately EUR 430/MWh. The plants were commissioned in
2016 and 2017.

Fortum’s Ulyanovsk wind farm is listed in the registry of
capacity as of January 2018. The 35 MW power plant is Russia's first
industrial wind park. Itwill receive CSA payments fora guaranteed
period of 15 years.

The Russian gas price increased by 3.9% in July 2017 and the
increase of the annual average gas price for 2017 was 2.0%.

Capital expenditure and divestments
Fortum currently estimates its capital expenditure, including
maintenance but excluding acquisitions, to be in the range of
EUR 600-700 million in 2018 most of which is related to hydro
and CHP capacity as well as new investments in renewables.
The maintenance capital expenditure in 2018 is estimated

at approximately EUR 300 million, well below the level of
depreciation.

not in Fortum’s favour. Fortum has appealed the decisions. If

the decisions remain in force despite the appeal, the negative
impact on the net profit would be approximately EUR 28 million
(approximately SEK 273 million). Fortum has not made a provision
for this, as, based on legal analysis, the EU Commission’s view
and supporting legal opinions, the cases should be ruled in
Fortum’s favour. The assessments concern the loans given in 2013
by Fortum’s Dutch financing company to Fortum’s subsidiaries

in Sweden. The interest income for these loans was taxed in the
Netherlands. The Swedish tax authority considers just over a half
of the interest relating to each loan as deductible, i.e. deriving from
business needs. The rest of the interest is seen as non-deductible.
The decisions are based on the changes in the Swedish tax
regulation in 2013.

On 30 June 2017, the Court of Appeal in Stockholm, Sweden,
ruled against Fortum related to Fortum’s income tax assessments in
Sweden for the years 2009-2012. Due to the decision of the Court of
Appeal, Fortum booked a tax cost of 1,175 MSEK (EUR 123 million)
in the second-quarter 2017 results. The booking did not have any
cash flow effect for Fortum, as the additional taxes and interest
have already been paid in 2016. The case concerns Fortum’s right to
deduct intra-group interest expenses in Sweden in the years 2009—
2012. Fortum restructured its operations and reallocated loans in
2004-2005 to secure future operations. Fortum does not agree with
the Court’s decision and had applied for the right to appeal from the
Supreme Administrative Court.

Business model

Fortum’s business activities cover the production and sales

of electricity and heat, waste-to-energy and circular economy
solutions as well as energy-sector expert services and various
consumer solutions. Fortum is the third largest power generator
and the largest electricity retailer in the Nordic countries. Globally,
the company is one of the leading heat producers. As two thirds of
Fortum’s power production is hydro and nuclear, it is also among
the lowest-emitting generators in Europe.

Fortum’s ambition is to increase its CO2-free power generation.
The company also has generation capacity based on fossil fuels,
located mainly in Russia, and it has worked to increase its efficiency
and reduce its specific emissions. Fortum is focusing on increasing
its solar and wind power capacity heavily over the coming years.

With core operations in 10 countries, Fortum employs a diverse
team of close to 9,000 energy-sector professionals. Fortum has 128
hydro power plants as well as 26 CHP (combined heat and power),
condensing and nuclear power plants. Globally, the company
supplies heat in 22 cities and towns and has five main waste
treatment facilities. Fortum’s key markets are the Nordic and Baltic
countries, Russia, Poland and India.

can have adverse effects on the environment and the safety and
security of employees, contractors and neighbouring societies. Key
sustainability risks are presented in the Risk management part in
the Operating and financial review. Climate change and the need
for decarbonisation and resource efficiency is changing energy
industry in a profound way and these changes also create new
business opportunities for Fortum.

Sustainability governance and policies

Sustainability management at Fortum is strategy-driven and is
based on the company’s Values, the Code of Conduct, the Supplier
Code of Conduct, the Sustainability Policy and other Group policies
and their specifying instructions. As sustainability is an integral
part of Fortum’s strategy, the highest decision making of these
issues falls on the duties of the Board of Directors, who share joint
responsibility on sustainability matters.

Fortum Executive Management decides on the sustainability
approach and Group-level sustainability targets that guide annual
planning. The targets are ultimately approved by Fortum’s Board
of Directors. Fortum’s line management is responsible for the
implementation of the Group's policies and instructions and for
day-to-day sustainability management. Realisation of the safety
targets is a part of Fortum’s short-term incentive system.

Fortum is a participant of the UN Global Compact initiative and
the UN Caring for Climate initiative. Fortum respects and supports
the International Bill of Human Rights, the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the core conventions
of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Additionally,
Fortum recognises in its operations the UN Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights, the statutes of the OECD Guidelines
for Multinational Enterprises, the International Chamber of

Financial performance and position Sustainability

Economic responsibility

Fortum’s goal is to achieve excellent financial performance in
strategically selected core areas through strong competence
and responsible ways of operating. Fortum measures financial
performance with return on capital employed (target: at least
10%) and capital structure (target: comparable net debt/EBITDA
around 2.5).

Fortum is a significant economic actor in its operating
countries. The most significant direct monetary flows of Fortum’s
operations come from revenue from customers, procurements
of goods and services from suppliers, compensation to lenders,
dividends to shareholders, growth and maintenance investments,
employee wages and salaries, and taxes paid. In 2017, investments
in COz-free production were EUR 375 (270) million.

Fortum supports social development and wellbeing in its
operating countries by e.g. paying taxes. The tax benefits Fortum
produces to society include not only corporate income taxes
but also several other taxes. In 2017, Fortum’s taxes borne were
EUR 445 (365) million. Fortum publishes its tax footprint annually.

Targets for reputation and customer satisfaction are monitored
annually. In the One Fortum Survey in 2017 company reputation
among key stakeholders was 72.3 (72.5) points (on a scale of 1-100)
and exceeded the target of 70.7 points. The stakeholder groups
selected for the One Fortum Survey differ between the years 2016
and 2017. The reference value for the 2017 target-setting (70.7) is
the reputation index (69.7) given by the same stakeholder groups in
2016. The Group target (70-74 points) for customer satisfaction was
achieved among all business areas, but not in retail electricity sales.
The Recycling and Waste Solutions unit was not part of the One
Fortum survey in 2017.

Fortum’s total purchasing volume in 2017 was EUR 3.2 (2.5)
billion and Fortum had about 16,000 suppliers of goods and
services. Fortum expects its business partners to act responsibly
and to comply with the Fortum Code of Conduct and the Fortum.
Supplier Code of Conduct. Fortum assesses the performance of its
business partners with supplier qualification and supplier audits.
In 2017, Fortum audited a total of 11 (13) suppliers in China, India,
Russia, Slovenia, Estonia and Finland. Most of the non-compliances

Risk management

Fortum share and shareholders

identified in the audits in 2017 were related to occupational safety,
working hours and remuneration.

Environmental responsibility

Fortum’s Group-level environmental targets are related to CO.
emissions, energy efficiency, and major environmental, health and
safety (EHS) incidents.

The Group Sustainability Policy together with the Minimum
Requirements for EHS Management steer Fortum’s environmental
management. Investments, acquisitions and divestments are
assessed based on the sustainability assessment criteria defined
in the Group’s Investment Manual. Operational-level activities
follow the requirements set forth in the ISO 14001 environmental
management standard, and 99.8% (99.9%) of Fortum’s power and
heat production worldwide has ISO 14001 certification.

Circular economy

Fortum’s aim is to promote resource efficiency improvements and
the transition towards a more extensive circular economy. Resource
efficiency and maximising the added value of waste and biomass
are key priorities in the environmental approach, as defined in the
Group Sustainability Policy.

In 2017, Fortum received a total of 1.2 million tonnes of non-
hazardous waste and 640,000 tonnes of hazardous waste from
customers. As much of the waste stream as possible is recycled,
recovered or reused. Waste that is unsuitable for recycling or reuse
as a material is incinerated in Fortum’s waste-to-energy plants in
the Nordic countries and Lithuania.

Sustainable energy production
Fortum’s energy production is primarily based on carbon dioxide-
free hydropower and nuclear power and on energy-efficient
combined heat and power (CHP). In line with the strategy, Fortum.
is targeting a gigawatt-scale solar and wind portfolio.

In 2017, Fortum’s power generation was 73.2 (73.1) TWh and
heat production 28.6 (27.8) TWh. 61% (62%) of the total power
generation was CO;-free. In the EU area, 96% (96%) of the power

4 22>

generation was CO,-free. In 2017, Fortum built and acquired
294 MW of renewable, carbon-free production.

The main fuels that Fortum uses to produce electricity and heat
are natural gas, nuclear fuel, coal, waste-derived fuels and biomass
fuels. The most significant fuel was natural gas, which accounted
for 62% (62%) of the total fuel consumption. The next highest fuel
use was uranium 21% (23%). Coal accounted for 10% (10%) of the
total fuel use, and waste-derived fuels and biomass fuels 3% (2%)
and 3% (3%), respectively. Russia accounted for 99% of the use of
natural gas and 51% of the use of coal.

Climate change mitigation

Fortum expects the concern about climate change to increase

the demand for low-carbon production and energy-efficient
solutions and products. Fortum aims to mitigate climate change by
investing in CO,-free energy production and by improving energy
and resource efficiency. Fortum is also adapting its operations to
climate change in production planning and in the assessment of
growth projects and investments.

In 2017, Fortum’s direct CO, emissions were 18.3 (18.6) Mt. 84%
(83%) of CO, emissions originated from Russian power plants.
Direct CO: emissions decreased due to the reduction in condensing
power production. Of the total CO, emissions, 2.3 (2.7) Mt were
within the EU’s emissions trading scheme (ETS). The estimate for
Fortum’s free emission allowances is 1.0 (1.0) Mt.

Emissions subject to ETS 2.3 2.7 21
Free emissions allowances 1.0 1.0 13
Emissions in Russia 15.4 15.5 17.0

Fortum’s specific carbon dioxide emissions from total energy
production remained at the same level and were 184 (184) g/kWh.
The specific CO emissions from total energy production asa five-
year average were at 188 (188) g/kWh, which is better than Fortum’s
Group target of 200 g/kWh.

Decreasing environmental impact

Emissions into air

Fortum’s activities cause various emissions to air. In addition to
carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions, these include flue-gas emissions
such as sulphur dioxide (SO.), nitrogen oxide (NO,) and particle
emissions. All power plants operate in compliance with their air
emission limits.

Fortum share and shareholders

Water withdrawal

Fortum uses large volumes of water at various types of power plants
and in district heat networks. In most cases, power plants do not
consume water — the water is discharged back to the same water
system from where it was withdrawn. Fortum withdrew a total of
2,100 (2,100) million m? of water in power and heat production;
94% of this amount was used as cooling water.

Radioactive waste

In 2017, 23.4 (19.6) tonnes of spent nuclear fuel was removed from
Loviisa power plant’s reactors in Finland. High-level radioactive
spent fuel is stored in an interim storage at the Loviisa power
plant site. The final disposal of the high-level radioactive waste is
scheduled to begin at Olkiluoto in Eurajoki in the first half of

the 2020s.

Biodiversity

Fortum’s main impacts on biodiversity are related to hydropower
production. Fuel procurement and flue-gas emissions may also have
a negative impact on biodiversity. On the other hand, increasing
CO,-free production mitigates the biodiversity loss caused by
climate change. Fortum’s Biodiversity Manual, revised in 2017,
defines the company’s approach in biodiversity management.

Environmental incidents

Fortum’s target is fewer than 21 major EHS incidents annually.
Major EHS incidents are monitored, reported and investigated,
and corrective actions are implemented. In 2017, there were 20
(22) major EHS (environmental, health and safety) incidents in
Fortum’s operations. There were 10 (11) environmental incidents,
out of which eight were spills. Fortum paid fines totalling RUB
8,000 (EUR 121) for the permit violation involving exceeding the
wastewater emission limit in Russia. The major EHS incidents did
not have significant environmental impacts.

4 23>

Social responsibility

Fortum’s social responsibility targets are related to the secure
supply of electricity and heat for customers, operational and
occupational safety as well as employee wellbeing.

Employees

‘The Group Human Resources Policy is based on the company’s
Values, Leadership Principles and Code of Conduct. The HR Policy
guides the daily work in the company, and the implementation

of the policy is followed up regularly through the employee
engagement survey, the annual performance and development
discussions, as well as other feedback practices.

Fortum’s operations are mainly based in the Nordic countries,
Russia, Poland and the Baltic Rim area. The total number of
employees at the end of 2017 was 8,785 (8,108). The number of
employees increased mainly due to the acquisition of Hafslund.

Occupational safety
For Fortum, excellence in safety is the foundation of the company’s
business and an absolute prerequisite for efficient and interruption-
free production. Fortum strives to be a safe workplace for the
employees and for the contractors and service providers who work
for the company. The Group Sustainability Policy, the Minimum
Requirements for EHS Management and more detailed Group-
level EHS manuals steer the work. A certified OHSAS 18001 safety
management system covers 98.4% (99.9%) of Fortum’s power and
heat production worldwide.

2017 was a challenging year in terms of occupational safety. Only
the total recordable incident frequency (TRIE) for own employees
and the number of severe accidents met the set target level.

Risk management

Fortum share and shareholders

The TRIF for Fortum employees was 1.8 (1.9) per one million
working hours, which is better than the target (< 2.5). The lost-
workday injury frequency (LWIE) for own personnel was 1.2 (1.0),
which did not meet the set target level (<1.0).

The lost workday injury frequency (LWIE) for contractors
continues to be Fortum’s main challenge. The LWIF for contractors
per million working hours was 4.2 (3.0), and Fortum did not achieve
the target of <3.5. The same challenge applies to the combined
LWIF (own employees and contractors): the result was 2.4 (1.8),
exceeding the target of 1.9.

In 2018, Fortum will implement new tools to assess contractor
safety performance as part of the supplier qualification process
and will also evaluate their safety practices in a more systematic
manner during work. Fortum will also introduce external safety
training for both the management level and key individuals leading
safety work as well as the most challenging business areas.

In 2017, as in 2016, there were no accidents leading to a fatality
in the company’s operations.

Open leadership, personnel development and wellbeing
In late 2017, Fortum launched the company’s revised Values and
new Leadership Principles. The Open Leadership framework
supports cooperation across units and aims to create an
environment that fosters innovation, flexibility and agility.

ForCare, Fortum’s programme for overall wellbeing at work,
aims to promote health, safety, employee work capacity and work
community functionality. As part of ForCare, the Energise Your
Day wellbeing programme was launched in several new operating
countries in 2017. The percentage of sickness-related absences
excluding DUON and Hafslund was 2.2 (2.3), which is better than
the target level of <2.3. The percentage of sickness-related absences
for Hafslund was 3.0.

Respect for human rights

Fortum’s goal is to operate in accordance with the UN Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights, and to apply these
principles in own operations as well as in country and partner risk
assessments and supplier audits.

2p

A sustainability assessment, including a human rights
evaluation, is carried out for investment projects — especially in new
operating areas — and also for new countries where Fortum plans to
expand the sales of products and services. In 2017, 15 (28) of these
assessments were made.

In 2017, there were no grievances related to human rights filed
through Fortum’s formal grievance channels, nor were there any
grievances carried over from the previous year.

Society
An uninterrupted and reliable energy supply is critical for society
to function. With planned preventive maintenance and condition
monitoring, Fortum ensures that the power plants operate reliably
to produce the electricity and heat customers need. The energy
availability of the company’s CHP plants in 2017 was, on average,
96.1%; the target was above 95%.

Fortum’s operations impact the local communities where
the power plants are located, and the company engages in many
kinds of collaboration with local stakeholders. Fortum’s Policy for
Sponsoring and Donations was revised in late 2017. According to
the policy Fortum’s sponsoring will focus on wellbeing of children
and youth, renewable energy projects, R&D and innovations
supporting Fortum’s strategy, recycling, recovery and reutilization.
The company also does significant collaboration with different
research and development projects, particularly with Nordic
universities. In 2017, Fortum’s support for activities promoting
the common good totalled about EUR 4.9 (2.9) million. The grants
awarded by Fortum Foundation were about EUR 696,000 (675,000).
Fortum Foundation is not part of Fortum Group.

Risk management

Risk management framework and objectives
Fortum’s Risk Management framework is comprised of the Group
Risk Policy and supporting documents. The Group Risk Policy
includes an overview of Fortum’s risk management systems
consisting of the general principles of risk management and the
main features of the risk management process. The objective of the
risk management systems are to;

+ support the development of the Group strategy,

+ support strategy execution,

+ support the achievement of agreed targets within acceptable
risk levels so that the Group’s ability to meet financial
commitments is not compromised,

+ ensure the understanding of material risks and uncertainties
affecting Fortum, and

+ support the prevention of accidents that can have a severe effect
on the health and safety of employees or third parties, and from
incidents that can have a material impact on Fortum’s assets,
reputation or the environment.

Risk management organisation

The main principle is that risks are managed at source meaning
that each Division, Development Unit and Corporate Function
Head is responsible for managing risks that arise within their
business operations. However, in order to take advantage of
synergies, certain risks are managed centrally. For example,
Group Treasury is responsible for managing financial risks and
cyber and information security risks are managed by Corporate
Security. The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) is responsible

for monitoring the efficiency of the company’s risk management
systems and for annually reviewing the Group Risk Policy and the
material risks and uncertainties. Corporate Risk Management, a
function headed by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reporting to the
CFO, provides instructions and tools which support the Group in
running an efficient risk management process. Corporate Risk
Management is responsible for assessing and reporting maturity of

management and that risks are monitored and followed-up ina
prudent manner. The main features of risk management process
consist of event identification, risk assessment, risk response and
risk control. Identification is carried out according to a structured
process and risks are assessed in terms of impact and likelihood
according to a Group-common methodology. Impact is assessed
not only in monetary terms, but also in terms of health and safety,
the environment and reputation. Risk owners, responsible for
implementing actions to respond to the risk, are defined by the
business and operational management. Risk responses can be to
avoid, mitigate, transfer or absorb the risk. Risk control processes,
which include monitoring and reporting of risks, are designed
to support compliance with approved instructions, manuals
and guidelines and to ensure that risk exposures remain within
approved limits and mandates.

Risk factors

Strategic risks

The main strategic risk is that the regulatory and market
environment develops in way that we have not been able to
foresee and prepare for. Future energy market and regulation
scenarios, including the impact of these to Fortum’s business, are

to, in the long-term, broaden the base of revenues and diversify into
new businesses, technologies and markets.

Risks which could hinder Fortum in executing this strategy
are continuously assessed, monitored and reported as part of the
strategy work. These risks include an inability to identify and carry
out successful investments and acquisitions with the related project
and integration risks, inability to manage and respond to changes
in energy policy and the regulatory environment, and inability to
manage and respond to changes in technology.

Investment and acquisition risks

Fortum’s strategy includes growth of operations in new businesses,

technologies and geographies, and any future investment or

acquisition, including partnerships, entails risk such as:

+ increased overall operating complexity and requirements for
management, personnel and other resources,

+ the need to understand the value drivers and their uncertainties
in investments or potential acquisition targets,

+ the need to understand and manage new markets with different
cultural and compliance requirements,

+ the need to understand and manage risks related to
sustainability and safety issues.

These risks are managed as part of the investment process which
includes requirements for risk identification and assessment and
action plans before investment decisions are made, and also sets
requirements to follow-up risks in projects and acquisitions.

Energy policy and regulation risks

The energy business is heavily influenced by national and EU-
level energy policies and regulations, and Fortum’s strategy has
been developed based on scenarios of the future development of
the regulatory environment in both existing and potential new
businesses and market areas. The overall complexity and possible
regulatory changes in Fortum’s various operating countries pose
arisk ifwe are not able to anticipate, identify and manage those
changes efficiently.

report Quarterly financial information

Fortum maintains an active dialogue with the bodies involved in
the development of laws and regulations in order to manage these
risks and proactively contribute to the development of the energy
policy and regulatory framework.

Nordic/EU
Fortum’s strategy in the power sector is based on a market-driven
development, which would mean more interconnections and
competition supported by increasing policy harmonization. Even
if the Nordic power market has a long tradition of harmonization,
national policies vary considerably when it comes to e.g. taxation,
permitting, subsidies and market model meaning that we have

to manage risks related to both EU regulation and national

regulation. Potential risks related to the future energy and climate

policy framework include;

+ The development towards integrated, flexible and dynamic
power market hampered by increasing policy costs and
uncoordinated national mechanisms,

+ Overlapping national carbon policies diluting the EU ETS and
carbon price despite the ETS reform,

+ Increasing cost burden for hydro power in Finland, driven
by fish obligations, grid costs and real estate taxation and
unbalanced implementation of the EU Water Framework
directive in Sweden, potentially leading to lower production
volumes,

+ Sustainability requirements for forest biomass leading to
reduced availability and increasing costs,

+ Implementation of national waste incineration taxes or other
measures due to opposition to incineration hampers the
competitiveness of waste-to-energy,

+ Substantial retroactive changes and/or discontinuation of
prevailing CHP support schemes in Baltic countries and
Poland or deteriorating competitiveness of CHP due to fuel tax
increases,

+ Emergence of windfall tax discussions following possible
positive electricity and carbon price development.

Financial performance and position Sustainability

The inter-linkage of these issues as well as national measures such
as taxation create uncertainty and changes in policies in one area
could undermine the effects of policy changes in other areas.

Russia

Russia is exposed to political, economic and social uncertainties
and risks resulting from changes in regulation, legislation,
economic and social upheaval and other similar factors. The
current economic sanctions may be enlarged and/or extended
having direct and indirect impacts on the business environment.
The main policy-related risks in Russia are linked to the
development of the whole energy sector, part of which, like the
wholesale power market, is liberalised while other parts, like
gas, heat, and retail electricity, are not. The wholesale power
market deregulation in Russia has been implemented toa large
extent according to original plans. However, regulated sectors are
inherently always exposed to a risk of regulatory changes which
could affect Fortum’s operations.

Technology risks

Fortum’s strategy includes developing or acquiring new
technologies, as well as digitalizing the business. Fortum’s R&D
and innovation activities focus on the development of the energy
system towards a future solar economy. Fortum is, for example,
developing circular economy, bio-economy and other renewable
energy concepts as well as innovative solutions for its customers.
New technologies expose Fortum to risks related to intellectual
property rights, data privacy and viability of technologies.
Technology risks are managed primarily through developing a
diversified portfolio of projects consisting of different technologies.

Sustainability risks

Corporate social responsibility and sustainable development
are integral parts of Fortum’s strategy. Fortum gives balanced
consideration to economic, environmental and social
responsibility. Changes to laws, regulations and the business
environment can pose a risk if not identified and managed

effectively and the same applies to changes in views of our main

stakeholders. In order to identify and manage these risks, Fortum
endorses a number of international voluntary charters, standards
and guidelines in the area of sustainability, conducts stakeholder
surveys annually and has defined internal policies and instructions

Environmental, health and safety and social risks
Operating power and heat generation plants, circular economy
services and waste management involves use, storage and
transportation of fuels and materials that can have adverse effects
on the environment and expose personnel, contractors and third
parties to safety risks. Assessment of environmental risks and
preparedness to operate in exceptional and emergency situations
follows legislative requirements as well as the requirements in
the environmental management standard (ISO 14001). The same
approach, based on the requirements in the operational health
and safety standard (OHSAS 18001), applies to risks related

to occupational health and safety and actions in emergency
situations.

Environmental, health and safety (EHS) risks as well as social
risks related to Fortum’s supply chain are evaluated through
supplier qualification, internal and external audits and risk
assessments including partner and country risk assessment.
Corrective and preventive actions are implemented when necessary.
EHS related risks together with social risks arising in investments
are evaluated in accordance with Fortum’s Investment manual.
Environmental risks and liabilities in relation to past actions have
been assessed and provisions have been made for future remedial
costs.

Fortum’s operations are exposed to physical risks caused by
climate change, including changes in weather patterns that could
alter energy demand and, for instance, hydropower production
volumes. Higher precipitation and temperatures may affect
hydropower production, dam safety, and also bioenergy supply

aap

and availability. Fortum adapts its operations to the changing
climate and takes it into consideration, for example, in
production and maintenance planning and in evaluating growth
and investment projects.

Tax risk

Fortum operates in a number of countries and is therefore
exposed to changes in taxation and how tax authorities interpret
tax laws. Changes in the international fiscal environment have
created a tax environment that is leading to new or increased
taxes and new interpretations of existing tax laws which has
decreased the predictability and visibility around how our
operations are taxed.

Fortum’s tax policy aims to identify simple and cost-efficient
solutions to manage taxes in a sustainable manner. Fortum’s
tax policy is based ona principle that tax is a consequence of
business and that compliance with tax rules and legislation and
transparency result in a correct tax contribution. This policy
leaves no room for artificial or other aggressive solutions.
Fortum is continuously following the development of tax related
issues and their impact on the Group and maintains an active
dialogue with tax authorities in unclear cases. Tax-related issues
are communicated openly both internally and externally and
Fortum’s tax footprint is published annually.

ince risks

Business ethics and compli
Fortum’s operations are subject to laws, rules and regulations
set forth by the relevant authorities, exchanges, and other
regulatory bodies in all markets in which Fortum operates.
Fortum’s ability to operate in certain countries may be affected
by future changes to local laws and regulations.

Fortum Code of Conduct enhances the understanding of
the importance of business ethics for all Fortum employees,
contractors and partners. Prevention of corruption is one of
the Code of Conduct’s focus areas. Fortum has procedures for
anti-corruption including prevention, oversight, reporting
and enforcement based on the requirements prescribed in
international legislation. Fortum’s supplier code of conduct sets

sustainability requirements for suppliers of goods and services. The
Supplier Code of Conduct is based on the principles of the United
Nations Global Compact and is divided into four sections: business
principles including anti-corruption, human rights, labour
standards and environment.

Fortum systematically identifies, assesses, mitigates and
reports compliance risks including risks related to sustainability
and business ethics. Internal controls are implemented to prevent
the possibilities of unauthorised activities or non-compliance with
Group policies and instructions.

Financial & commodity market risks

Commodity market and fuel risks

Fortum’s business is exposed to fluctuations in prices and
availability of commodities used in the production and sales of
energy products. The main exposure is toward electricity prices and
volumes, prices of emissions and prices and availability of fuels.
Fortum hedges its exposure to commodity market risks in
accordance with annually approved Hedging Guidelines, Strategies
and Mandates. For further information on hedge ratios, exposures,
sensitivities and outstanding derivatives contracts, see > Note 3
Financial risk management.

Electricity price and volume risks

In competitive markets, such as in the Nordic region, the wholesale
price of electricity is determined as the balance between supply
and demand. The short-term factors affecting electricity prices and
volumes on the Nordic market include hydrological conditions,
temperature, CO» allowance prices, fuel prices, economic
development and the import/export situation.

Electricity price risks are hedged by entering into electricity
derivatives contracts, primarily on the Nasdaq Commodities
power exchange. Hedging strategies are continuously evaluated as
electricity and other commodity market prices, the hydrological
balance and other relevant parameters change. Hedging of the
Generation segment’s power sales is performed in EUR ona
Nordic level covering both Finland and Sweden, and the currency

Risk management

Fortum share and shareholders

component of these hedges in the Swedish entity is currently not
hedged. In Russia, electricity prices and capacity sales are the main
sources of market risk. The electricity price is highly correlated
with the gas price and exposure is mitigated through the use of
fixed-price bilateral agreements. In India, the electricity price
received from solar production are fixed through long term power-
purchasing agreements.

Emission and environmental value risks

The European Union has established an emissions trading

scheme to reduce the amount of CO: emissions. In addition to

the emissions trading scheme, there are other trading schemes in
environmental values in place in Sweden, Norway and Poland. Part
of Fortum’s power and heat generation is subject to requirements of
these schemes. There is currently no trading scheme in Russia for
emissions or other environmental values.

The main factor influencing the prices of CO2 allowances and
other environmental values is the supply and demand balance.
Fortum hedges its exposure to these prices and volumes through
the use of CO, futures and environmental certificates.

Fuel price and volume risks
Power and heat generation requires use of fuels that are purchased
on global or local markets. The main fuels used by Fortum are
natural gas, uranium, coal, various biomass-based fuels and waste.
The main risk factor for fuels that are traded on global markets such
as coal and natural gas, is the uncertainty in price. Prices are largely
affected by demand and supply imbalances that can be caused by,
for example, increased demand growth in developing countries,
natural disasters or supply constraints in countries experiencing
political or social unrest. For fuels traded on local markets, such
as bio-fuels, the volume risk in terms of availability of the raw
material of appropriate quality is more significant as there may be
a limited number of suppliers. Due to the sanctions and economic
development in Russia, the risks related to imported fuels from
Russia have increased.

In the Nordic market, exposure to fuel prices is limited due to
Fortum’s flexible generation capacity which allows for switching

42>

between different fuels according to prevailing market conditions.
In some cases, the fuel price risk can be transferred to the
customer. The remaining exposure to fuel price risk is mitigated
through fixed-price physical delivery contracts or derivative
contracts. The main fuel source for heat and power generation in
Russia is natural gas. Natural gas prices are partially regulated, so
the price risk exposure is limited.

Liquidity and refinancing risks

Fortum’s business is capital intensive and there is a regular need

to raise financing. Fortum maintains a diversified financing
structure in terms of debt maturity profile, debt instruments and
geographical markets. Liquidity and refinancing risks are managed
through a combination of cash positions and committed credit
facility agreements with its core banks. The credit risk of cash
positions has been mitigated by diversifying the deposits to high-
credit quality financial institutions and issuers of corporate debt.
In relation to the offer for Uniper shares, Fortum has commitments
from 10 relationship banks to provide credit facilities at the request
of Fortum in an aggregate amount of up to EUR 12,000 million.

Currency and interest rate risks
Fortum’s debt portfolio consists of interest-bearing liabilities
and derivatives ona fixed- and floating-rate basis with differing
maturity profiles. Fortum manages the duration of the debt
portfolio through use of different types of financing contracts and
interest rate derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps.
Fortum’s currency exposures are divided into transaction
exposures (foreign exchange exposures relating to contracted cash
flows and balance sheet items where changes in exchange rates
will have an impact on earnings and cash flows) and translation
exposure (foreign exchange exposure that arises when profits and
balance sheets in foreign entities are consolidated at the Group
level). The main principle is that material transaction exposures
should be hedged while translation exposures are not hedged, or
are hedged selectively. An exception is the Generation segment’s
hedging of power sales in Sweden where the currency component is
currently not hedged. The main translation exposures toward the

EUR/RUB, EUR/SEK and EUR/NOK are monitored continuously.
Changes in these currency rates affect Fortum’s profit level and
equity when translating results and net assets to euros.

Counterparty risks

Fortum is exposed to counterparty risk whenever there is a
contractual arrangement with an external counterparty including
customers, suppliers, partners, banks, clearing houses and trading
counterparties.

Credit risk exposures relating to financial derivative
instruments are often volatile. The majority of commodity
derivatives are cleared through exchanges such as Nasdaq OMX
commodities. The trend toward more use of futures contracts
instead of forward contracts is decreasing the credit exposure
toward clearing houses. Derivatives contracts are also entered into
directly with external counterparties and such contracts are limited
to high-credit-quality counterparties active on the financial or
commodity markets.

Due to the financing needs and management of liquidity,
Fortum has counterparty credit exposure to a number of banks
and financial institutions. The majority of the exposure is toward
Fortum’s key relationship banks, which are highly creditworthy
institutions, but also includes exposure to the Russian financial
sector in terms of deposits with financial institutions as well as
to banks that provide guarantees for suppliers and contracting
parties. Deposits in Russia have been concentrated to the most
creditworthy state-owned or controlled banks.

Credit risk exposures relating to customers is spread across
awide range of industrial counterparties, small businesses and
private individuals over a range of geographic regions. The majority
of exposure is to the Nordic market, Poland and Russia. The risk of
non-payment in the electricity and heat sales business in Russia is
higher than in the Nordic market. In order to manage counterparty
credit risk, Fortum has routines and processes to identify, assess
and control exposure. Credit checks are performed before entering
into commercial obligations and exposure limits are set for larger
individual counterparties. Creditworthiness is monitored through
the use of internal and external sources so that mitigating actions

Risk management

Fortum share and shareholders

can be taken when needed. Mitigating actions include demanding
collateral, such as guarantees, managing payment terms and
contract length, and the use of netting agreements.

Operational risks

Operational risks are defined as the negative effects resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes, systems or equipment, or
from external events. Process-related risks are assessed and controls
for the most relevant risks are defined and implemented as part of
the internal controls framework. Equipment and system risks are
primarily managed through monitoring and maintenance planning.
In addition, all Fortum’s industrial assets are covered by a Group
Master Policy covering property damage and business interruption
risks which mitigates the impact of internal and external events.

Operational risks at production facilities

Combined heat and power (CHP) and recycling and waste
CHP production and the recycling and waste business involve

the use, storage and transportation of fuels and waste (including
hazardous waste). Leakage and contamination of the surrounding
environment could lead to clean-up costs and third-party liabilities.
An explosion or fire at a facility could cause damages to the plant or
third-parties and lead to possible business interruption. These risks
are mitigated by condition monitoring, preventive maintenance
and other operational improvements as well as competence
development of personnel operating the plants. Requirements

for waste are clearly specified and samples are tested for selected
incoming waste deliveries. Risks in large CHP projects are
mitigated through contract structures and insurance coverage.

Hydro power

Operational events at hydro power generation facilities can lead
to physical damages, business interruptions, and third- party
liabilities. A long-term program is in place for improving the
surveillance of the condition of dams and for securing the
discharge capacity in extreme flood situations. In Sweden, third-
party liabilities from dam failures are strictly the plant owner's

42>

responsibility. Together with other hydro power producers, Fortum
hasa shared dam liability insurance program in place that covers
Swedish dam failure liabilities up to SEK 10,000 million.

Nuclear power

Fortum owns the Loviisa nuclear power plant, and has minority
interests in two Finnish and two Swedish nuclear power
companies. At the Loviisa power plant, the assessment and
improvement of nuclear safety is a continuous process performed
under the supervision of the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority
of Finland (STUK).

Third-party liability relating to nuclear accidents is strictly the
plant operator's responsibility and must be covered by insurance.
As the operator of the Loviisa power plant, Fortum has a statutory
liability insurance policy of 600M SDR (Special Drawing Right) and
the same type of insurance policies are in place for the operators
where Fortum has a minority interest.

Cyber and information security risks

Fortum’s business operations are dependent on well-functioning IT
and information management systems and processes. Due to the
nature of the business, large amounts of data are processed, often
in real-time, and used for decision-making and in internal and
external communication and reporting. Securing information and
availability of the systems are essential for Fortum. Cyber security
risks, including risks related to information, industrial control
systems (ICS), digitalization and privacy, are managed centrally
by Corporate Security. Group instructions and procedures set
requirements for managing and mitigating cyber security risks.

General Data Protection Regulation will become applicable
on 25th of May 2018. The regulation contains a number of
requirements related to processing personal data. Therefore,
Fortum has established a Group-wide program to ensure the
fulfilment of the requirements.

IT functions in the business, support functions and outsourcing
partners are responsible for identifying and mitigating operational
IT security related risks as well as managing IT security incidents.
IT functions are also responsible for IT service continuity.

Authorisations from the Annual General Meeting 2017

In 2017, the Annual General Meeting decided to authorise the Board of Directors to decide on the
repurchase and disposal of the company's own shares up to a maximum number of 20,000,000 shares,
which corresponds to approximately 2.25% ofall the shares in the company. The authorisation is
effective for a period of 18 months from the resolution of the General Meeting. The authorisation had not
been used by the end of 2017.

Dividend policy

The dividend policy ensures that shareholders receive a fair remuneration for their entrusted capital,
supported by the company’s long-term strategy that aims at increasing earnings per share and thereby
the dividend. When proposing the dividend, the Board of Directors looks at a range of factors, including
the macro environment, balance sheet strength as well as future investment plans. Fortum Corporation’s
target is to paya stable, sustainable and over time increasing dividend, in the range of 50-80% of
earnings per share, excluding one-offitems.

Dividend distribution proposal

The distributable funds of Fortum Corporation as at 31 December 2017 amounted to

EUR 5,170,240,554.04 including the profit of the financial period 2017 of EUR 932,525,770.24. The
company’s liquidity is good and the dividend proposed by the Board of Directors will not compromise
the company’s liquidity.

The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 1.10 per share
be paid for 2017.

Based on the number of registered shares as at 1 February 2018 the total amount of dividend proposed
to be paid is EUR 977,203,749.50. The Board of Directors proposes that the remaining part of the
distributable funds will be retained in shareholders’ equity.
