Bertelsmann Printing Group unites Bertelsmann’s printing
activities. They include all the Group's gravure, offset
and book printing companies in Germany, the United
Kingdom and the United States. In addition, various
digital marketing services are offered, such as data-driven
multichannel marketing. Bertelsmann Printing Group
also includes the storage media producer Sonopress, the
specialty printer Topac and the multichannel marketing
platform DeutschlandCard.

Bertelsmann Education Group comprises Bertelsmann’s
education activities. The digital education and service
offerings are primarily in the healthcare sector and in the area
of in-company training and development as well as in the
university education area. The education activities include
the online education provider Relias, the US university
Alliant and venture fund investments.

Bertelsmann Investments comprises Bertelsmann's global
start-up investments. The activities are focused on the
strategic growth markets of Brazil, China, India and the United
States. Investments are largely made through the funds
Bertelsmann Brazil Investments (BBI), Bertelsmann Asia
Investments (BAI), Bertelsmann India Investments (BII) and
Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments (BDMI).

Regulatory Environment

Bertelsmann has television and radio operations in several
European countries that are subject to regulation. In Germany,
for example, the media is subject to oversight by the Com-
mission on Concentration in the Media. Bertelsmann Group
companies occupy leading market positions in many lines of
business, and may therefore have limited potential for growth
through acquisition due to antitrust legislation. Moreover,
some education activities are subject to regulatory provisions
of government authorities and accreditation bodies. Some
of the financial services activities are subject to banking
supervision regulations.

Because its profit participation certificates and bonds
are publicly listed, Bertelsmann is required to comply with
capital market regulations applicable to publicly traded
companies.

Shareholder Structure
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is a capital market-oriented but
unlisted company limited by shares. Three foundations

(Bertelsmann Stiftung, Reinhard Mohn Stiftung and BVG-Stiftung)
indirectly hold 80.9 percent of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA

6 Financial Information Combined Management Report

shares, with the remaining 19.1 percent held indirectly by
the Mohn family. Bertelsmann Verwaltungsgesellschaft
(BVG) controls all voting rights at the General Meeting of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and Bertelsmann Management SE
(general partner).

Strategy

Bertelsmann’s strategic focus is on a fast-growing, digital,
international and diversified Group portfolio. Businesses in
which Bertelsmann invests should have long-term stable
growth, global reach, sustainable business models, high
market-entry barriers and scalability. At the beginning of
2021, Bertelsmann defined a Group-wide growth initiative
and presented the new strategic growth priorities necessary
for that: national media champions, global content, global
services, online education and investment portfolio. Further
developing the strategy in this way is necessary to meet
new challenges, such as growing competition from US tech
platforms. The Group aims to grow in both existing and new
lines of business through organic initiatives and acquisitions.
The following topics form the basis for the successful
implementation of the strategy: tech & data, upskilling,
cooperation and alliances. Substantial progress was made
in the implementation of the new strategic priorities in the
2021 financial year.

The announced mergers of Groupe M6 and Groupe TF1 in
France, of RTL Nederland and Talpa in the Netherlands, as
well as the completed combination of RTL Deutschland and
the German magazine businesses and brands of Gruner +
Jahr, which was implemented in early 2022, will serve to
create national media champions in the European markets.
RTL Group initiated further consolidation steps with the
announced disposals of RTL Belgium and RTL Croatia. The
streaming services RTL+ in Germany and Videoland in the
Netherlands recorded continued substantial increases in
paying subscribers. RTL Deutschland further reinforced its
market position through the full acquisition of Super RTL, and
Gruner + Jahr sold its French subsidiary Prisma Media to the
French media group Vivendi.

Bertelsmann also invested in the expansion of the global
content business. The production company Fremantle
announced several acquisitions and stake increases, and
established the Global Factual unit in order to expand the
business in high-end documentaries. Penguin Random
House achieved creative and business successes, for
example with “How to Avoid Climate Disaster” by Bill Gates


--- Page 4 ---

and “Atlas of the Heart” by Brené Brown. BMG signed
global superstars such as Bryan Adams, Santana and
Johnny Marr, and — with the acquisition of the rock
band Motley Crile’s music catalogue — effected the
single biggest catalog acquisition since the company
was founded in 2008. In March, BMG also entered into
a strategic partnership with the private equity firm KKR
for the acquisition of major music rights packages. In
October, BMG also announced the acquisition of an
extensive portfolio of Tina Turner rights.

Global services were also further expanded. The customer
experience company Majorel recorded strong organic
growth. To support its dynamic development, Majorel
entered the capital market with its flotation on Euronext
Amsterdam. Arvato Supply Chain Solutions invested in the
expansion and automation of its global network of locations.
Arvato Financial Solutions also grew organically, in particular
with its range of “purchase on account” services. Arvato
Systems won various business awards, underscoring both
the company’s expertise and its market reputation as a
partner in digital transformation.

Bertelsmann Education Group benefited from continued
high demand for the digital education and training provision
of Relias and Alliant. Furthermore, Bertelsmann Education
Group, together with Bertelsmann, continued with the digital
training campaign #50000Chances, Bertelsmann’‘s response
to the skills shortage in the areas of cloud, data and artificial
intelligence.

Bertelsmann further expanded its global investment portfolio
and made around 100 new and follow-up investments during
the reporting period. As of the end of 2021, Bertelsmann
Investments held a total of 290 investments through
its four international funds. In Brazil, the acquisition of
25 percent of the capital shares and 46 percent of the
voting rights in the listed education company Afya was
completed. During the reporting period, Bertelsmann
Investments also participated in a new financing round
for Shiprocket, an Indian e-commerce service provider
whose business has grown strongly during the corona-
virus pandemic. At the same time, Bertelsmann Invest-
ments realized profits from full and partial disposals
of companies, among them Eruditus, a global provider of
executive education.

Bertelsmann is continually developing its strategy.
Compliance with and achievement of the strategic devel-
opment priorities are examined by the Executive Board
and at the divisional level, through regular meetings of

the Strategy and Business Committees and as part of the
annual Strategic Planning Dialogue between the Execu-
tive Board and the Supervisory Board. In addition, relevant
markets and the competitive environment are analyzed on
an ongoing basis in order to draw conclusions concern-
ing the further development of the Group's strategy. The
Executive Board is also supported by the Group Manage-
ment Committee (GMC) on issues of corporate strategy and
development. This Committee is composed of executives
representing key businesses, countries and regions, and
select Group-wide functions.

The Group's content-based and entrepreneurial creativity is
also very important for the implementation of its strategy.
Bertelsmann will therefore continue to
creative core of its businesses. Simultaneously, innovation
competence is very important for Bertelsmann and is a key
strategic component (see the section “Innovations”).

invest in the

Value-Oriented Management System

Bertelsmann’s primary objective is continuous growth of the
company’s value through a sustained increase in profitability
with efficient capital investment at the same time. To manage
the Group, Bertelsmann has been using a value-oriented
management system for many years, which focuses on
revenues, operating earnings and optimal capital investment.
For formal reasons, Bertelsmann makes a distinction between
strictly defined and broadly defined operational performance
indicators.

Strictly defined operational performance _ indicators,
including revenues, operating EBITDA and Bertelsmann
Value Added (BVA), are used to directly assess cur-
rent business performance and are correspondingly
used in the outlook. BVA is used primarily for man-
agement at the Group level, whereas revenues and
operating EBITDA, above all, are more meaningful
performance indicators for the divisions. As distinguished
from strictly defined performance indicators, broader per-
formance indicators are also used and are partially derived
from the above-mentioned indicators or are strongly influ-
enced by them. These include the EBITDA margin and the
cash conversion rate. The financial management system,
with defined internal financing targets, is also part of
the broadly defined value-oriented management system.
Details of the expected development of performance indi-
cators used in the broader sense are provided at best as
additional information and are not included in the outlook.

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2021 7


--- Page 5 ---

To explain the business performance, and to control and
manage the Group, Bertelsmann uses additional alternative
performance measures that are not defined in accordance
with IFRS (more details are given in the section “Alternative
Performance Measures”).

Strictly Defined Operational Performance Indicators

To control and manage the Group, Bertelsmann uses rev-
enues, operating EBITDA and BVA as performance indicators.
Revenue is used as a growth indicator of businesses. In the
financial year 2021, Group revenues rose by 8.1 percent to
€18.7 billion (previous year: €17.3 billion). Organic growth
was 11.4 percent, after an organic decline of 1.7 percent in
the previous year.

A key performance indicator for measuring the profitability of
the Group and the divisions is operating EBITDA. Operating
EBITDA rose during the reporting period by 3.1 percent to
€3,241 million (previous year: €3,143 million).

Bertelsmann uses BVA for assessing the profitability of
operations and return on invested capital. BVA measures
the profit realized above and beyond the appropriate
return on invested capital. At €474 million, BVA in the
financial year 2021 was below the previous year’s figure of
€355 million.

Broadly Defined Performance Indicators

To assess business development, other performance
indicators are used that are partially derived from reve-
nues and operating EBITDA or are strongly influenced by
these figures.

The cash conversion rate serves as a measure of cash
generated from business activities, which should be between
90 percent and 100 percent as a long-term average. In the
financial year 2021, the cash conversion rate was 107 percent
(previous year: 118 percent).

The EBITDA margin is used as an additional criterion for
assessing business performance. In the financial year 2021,
the EBITDA margin was 17.3 percent, slightly below the
previous year's figure of 18.2 percent.

Bertelsmann’s financial management system is defined by
the internal financial targets outlined in the section “Net

8 Financial Information Combined Management Report

Assets and Financial Position.” These financing principles are
pursued in the management of the Group and are included
in the broadly defined value-oriented management system.

The non-financial performance indicators (employees, cor-
porate responsibility and similar topics) are not included in
the broadly defined value-oriented management system. As
they can still only be measured to a limited extent, it is not
possible to make any clear quantifiable statements concern-
ing interrelated effects and value increases. For this reason,
the non-financial performance indicators have not yet been
used for the management of the Group but are gaining in
relevance for Bertelsmann’s businesses.

Non-Financial Performance Indicators

The following section refers to the non-financial performance
indicators at Bertelsmann. For more information about the
organization, management and key topics of corporate
responsibility, including additional information on employee
concerns, please refer to the section “Combined Non-Financial
Statement.”

Employees

Bertelsmann’s employees are the most important key for the
company’s long-term success. At the end of the financial
year 2021, Bertelsmann employed 145,027 members of staff
worldwide. Thanks to their creativity and entrepreneurial
spirit, the company is able to continuously develop further.
This is underlined by the results of the Group-wide 2021
employee survey, in which the indices for “Creativity” and
“Entrepreneurship” showed an improvement.

Further information and employee-related non-financial
performance indicators are presented in the “Employee
Matters” section (Combined Non-Financial Statement).

Innovations

Businesses invest in the research and development of
new products in order to ensure their long-term com-
petitiveness. Bertelsmann has a similar imperative to
create innovative media content, media-related prod-
ucts, and services and educational offerings in a rapidly
changing environment. Instead of conventional research

Bertelsmann views the
company’s own power as_ particularly
important for business development. The long-term
success of the Group depends heavily on product
innovations, investing in growth markets and integrating
new technologies. Furthermore, innovative expertise is
very important for strategy implementation.

and development activities,

innovative

Bertelsmann relies on innovation and growth in core opera-
tions and new business fields. The key success factors of
Bertelsmann’s innovation management include continu-
ously following cross-industry trends and observing new
markets. At the Group level, Bertelsmann works with the
divisions to continuously identify and implement innovative
business strategies. Alongside market-oriented activities,
support is given to Group-wide initiatives that actively pro-
mote knowledge transfer and collaboration. Furthermore,
cooperation is being expanded among the divisions.

Innovations at RTL Group focus on three core topics: con-
tinuously developing new, high-quality video content; using
all digital distribution channels; and better monetization of
RTL Group's audience reach by personalization, recommen-
dations and addressing target groups. In 2021, RTL Group
launched a new identity and design for its core brand RTL.
The comprehensive redesign and repositioning was initi-
ated to strengthen RTL as Europe's leading entertainment
brand — standing for positive entertainment and indepen-
dent journalism, as well as inspiration, energy and attitude.
Within this project, the German streaming service TV Now
was rebranded to RTL+. Furthermore, RTL Group announced
the expansion of RTL+ over the course of 2022 into a cross-
media entertainment service, comprising video, music, pod-
casts, audio books and e-magazines, which will be a unique
selling proposition in the German-speaking market. Another
innovative focus point is addressable TV advertising, which
combines the broad reach of linear TV with targeted digital
advertising. In October 2021, RTL Group and Amobee, a
global leader of advertising technologies, announced the
formation of TechAlliance. This comprehensive cooperation
will be a joint sales and services company for the ad-tech
solutions of Amobee and Smartclip, which is part of
RTL Deutschland. The planned TechAlliance will be the first
European-wide offering for programmatic access to address-
able TV advertising.

Innovations at Penguin Random House have been driven by
investments in distribution and supply chains, consumer

marketing engagement and the advancement of the com-
pany’s Diversity, Equity & Inclusion goals. Its lead US distri-
bution facility installed Goods-to-Person, an automated
material-handling system to provide dense storage, picking
efficiencies and customer- and publisher-support enhance-
ments. Its US Consumer Marketing team launched an inter-
nally developed proprietary tool, Today's Top Books, to mine
web-wide data to promote the top five Penguin Random
House titles to share daily with subscribers of the Penguin
Random House platform. In 2021, Penguin Random House
Audio introduced Ahab, a global online casting platform, to
better enable audiobook-, video game-, documentary-, pod-
cast- and visual-content creators to find multicultural actors
to hire. Penguin Random House UK began its Next Editors
Program, an 18-month action-training session for Black,
Asian, Latin American and other minority ethnic individuals,
who are currently underrepresented in editorial roles, to
develop the skills and expertise to become book-publishing
editors.

Innovations at Gruner + Jahr in the past financial year mainly
consisted of developing and expanding numerous new
journalistic formats. A partnership between Gruner + Jahr
and RTL Deutschland resulted in the successful TV series
“Faking Hitler,” which was based on the podcast of the
same name about the forged Hitler diaries, as well as crime
documentaries such as “Der Maskenmann,” which was
produced by Stern Crime and Vox. Stern, in partnership
with the broadcasters RTL and ntv, launched the podcast
“heute wichtig,” and Vox and Stern worked together on a
long-term documentary on the aftermath of the flood disaster
in the Ahr valley. In 2021, Gruner + Jahr also expanded the
successful personality magazines segment and launched
the home and lifestyle magazine “Guidos Deko Queen.” The
magazine is accompanied by a new TV show of the same
name on Vox.

Innovation at BMG is based on its distinctive market posi-
tioning and unique structure, operating the traditionally
separate music publishing, recordings, and other service
areas off the same integrated global platform. Innovation
is focused on delivering its core values of service, fair-
ness and transparency. Notable developments in 2021
included the launch of a new global benefits program on
the company’s myBMG app, offering discounts and value-
added services to its songwriter and producer clients,
and a partnership with Google Cloud to enhance service
to artists and songwriters to build a scalable, global

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2021 9

infrastructure. The strategic expansion of BMG’s service
offering included further acquisitions in live events in
Germany and the international expansion of BMG'’s artist
management partner, Shelter Music Group.

Innovations at Arvato are geared towards further optimizing
existing services, and towards developing and implementing
new customer solutions. Arvato Supply Chain Solutions,
as part of its digitalization strategy, made major invest-
ments in cutting-edge automation technology and the
expansion of its cloud infrastructure. Arvato Financial
Solutions developed a pioneering fintech solution for the
auto industry. The basic idea behind this new offering is to
bring the subscription model into the world of carsharing,
with a view to doing the same with other digital busi-
ness models in the future. The IT service provider Arvato
Systems considerably expanded its expertise in the areas of
cloud computing, artificial intelligence and IT security, and
enhanced its service portfolio in these innovation fields.
In addition, Majorel entered into a partnership with
OmniBot, thereby further expanding its range of services
in the field of automated customer interaction in a
targeted way.

Innovations at Bertelsmann Printing Group centered on
further developing existing processes with new technolo-
gies and digital solutions, and expanding its portfolio of
products and services. Mohn Media invested in optimizing
processes and procedures. At GGP Media, an existing
web service for customers from the publishing industry
was expanded into a smart platform for collaborations
between printers, publishers and agencies, and participant
communication in the multichannel marketing platform
DeutschlandCard was further digitalized and enhanced
with gamification elements.

Innovations at Bertelsmann Education Group mainly
consisted of developing digital, technology-based and
customized education offerings. For example, in the
healthcare sector, Relias employs health experts (including
doctors, nurses and therapists) to continue developing
teaching content and platforms for training skills specific
to clinic and nursing home personnel. Another important
focus was the development of additional support services
for customers looking to recruit nursing home personnel.
In the university education segment, Alliant used data
science and advanced analytics to develop new services
for students.

Report on Economic Position

Corporate Environment
Overall Economic Developments

In 2021, global economic development was once again driven
largely by the coronavirus pandemic. Real gross domestic
product (GDP) rose 5.9 percent, after falling 3.5 percent in
2020. However, the strong upturn was accompanied in many
countries by price rises and supply bottlenecks.

In the euro area, economic growth was particularly strong
in the summer. Overall, real GDP rose 5.2 percent in 2021,
after falling 6.6 percent in the previous year. However, rising
infection rates around the end of the year made necessary the
reintroduction of temporary containment measures.

The fourth wave of infections has again affected Germany's
economic recovery recently. Real GDP rose 2.9 percent in
2021 compared to a decrease of 4.6 percent in the previ-
ous year. The French economy recovered far more strongly.
Real GDP rose 7.0 percent in 2021, after a decline of
8.0 percent in the previous year. The economy of the
United Kingdom also enjoyed a strong recovery. Real GDP
rose by 7.5 percent compared to a reduction of 9.4 percent
in the previous year.

The economy of the United States also recovered from the
effects of the coronavirus pandemic, although the pace of the
recovery also slowed towards the end of the year. Real GDP
rose 5.7 percent, after falling 3.4 percent in the previous year.

Developments in Relevant Markets

The following analysis focuses on markets and regions that
are of a sufficient size and are strategically important from a
Group perspective.

The German TV advertising market grew significantly in 2021
and the TV advertising markets in France, the Netherlands
and Hungary, and the streaming markets in Germany and the
Netherlands showed strong growth.

The markets for printed books showed positive development
overall in 2021. There was strong growth in revenue for printed
books in the United States and in the Spanish-language
market, while the British and German markets each showed


--- Page 8 ---

moderate growth. After noticeable growth in the previous
year, revenues from e-books were down moderately in the
United States and strongly in the United Kingdom. In contrast,
revenues from digital audiobooks continued to grow strongly
in both countries.

In 2021, the German magazine market was characterized by
stable print advertising revenues and moderately declining
circulation revenues, while the relevant digital market recorded
strong growth.

The global music market recorded significant growth in the
publishing market segment in 2021, and strong growth in the
recordings market segment.

The service markets relevant for Arvato — customer experi-
ence solutions, supply chain solutions and IT solutions —
were characterized by significant to strong growth, while the
market for financial services recorded a moderate decline
largely due to regulatory changes.

In 2021, the European printing markets recorded stable
development in the offset business and moderate declines
in the gravure printing business. The North American book
printing market grew strongly.

In 2021, the education markets in the United States exhibited
significant to strong growth in the market segments where
Bertelsmann is involved — namely, training in healthcare and
university education.

Significant Events in the Financial Year

In April 2021, RTL Group sold the interest held in its subsid-
iary SpotX to the US ad-tech company Magnite. RTL Group
received a cash payment of US$640 million and 12.4 million
shares of Magnite stock.

In early May 2021, Nuria Cabuti, CEO of the Spanish-
language book publishing group Penguin Random House Grupo
Editorial, was appointed to the Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
Supervisory Board effective June 1, 2021. She will be a
member of this oversight board in her role as representative
of the Bertelsmann executives. In this capacity, Nuria Cabuti
succeeds lan Hudson, who stepped down from the Super-
visory Board after leaving the Group in March 2020.

In May 2021, Groupe TF1, Groupe M6, Groupe Bouygues and
RTL Group announced the signing of agreements to immedi-
ately begin exclusive negotiations for the merger of Groupe
TF1 and Groupe M6. The planned business combination was
unanimously approved by each of the boards of directors of
the four affected groups. In July 2021, after favorable opin-
ions had been issued by the French employee representative
bodies, Groupe Bouygues and RTL Group signed agreements
relating to the merger. The closing of the transaction is sub-
ject to the approval of the relevant authorities and the extra-
ordinary general meetings of Groupe TF1 and Groupe M6,
respectively. The transaction is expected to close by the
beginning of 2023.

Effective May 31, 2021, Gruner + Jahr sold its interest held in
its French subsidiary Prisma Media to the French media group
Vivendi.

In June 2021, RTL Group announced plans to merge its
channels and connected media businesses in the Netherlands
with Talpa Network into a national media group. Talpa Network
will contribute television, radio, print, digital, e-commerce and
other assets, and will receive in return a 30 percent stake in
the expanded company RTL Nederland. RTL Group will hold
the remaining 70 percent of the merged group and exercise
control over the expanded RTL Nederland. The transaction is
subject to the approval of antitrust authorities. The transaction
is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2022.

Also in June 2021, RTL Group announced the planned sale
of its Belgian family of channels RTL Belgium to the Belgian
media companies DPG Media and Groupe Rossel. The sale is
subject to the approval of the responsible antitrust authorities.
The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022.

In July 2021, RTL Deutschland acquired the remaining
50 percent of the shares in Super RTL (RTL Disney Fernsehen
GmbH & Co. KG). RTL Group's shareholding in Super RTL is
now 100 percent. The acquisition of the full interest in Super
RTL is in line with RTL Group's consolidation strategy and
supports the growth plan for the RTL streaming service RTL+.

The takeover of Gruner + Jahr’s German magazine busi-
nesses and brands by RTL Deutschland was announced on
August 6, 2021. Merging these two companies forms a
national cross-media champion in the areas of television,
streaming, magazines, radio and digital media. The trans-
action closed on January 1, 2022. As of the beginning of

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2021 a


--- Page 9 ---

the financial year 2022, Gruner + Jahr is no longer reported
as an independent division. The remaining Gruner + Jahr
activities will be assigned to the Bertelsmann Investments
division in the future. This does not affect the reported figures
in the 2021 Annual Report.

In early August 2021, Bertelsmann also completed the
acquisition of shares in the Brazilian education company
Afya, thereby further expanding its global education busi-
ness. The Group acquired 25 percent of the shares and
46 percent of the voting rights in Afya. The listed company is
a leading provider of medical education and training in Brazil.
Bertelsmann acquired the shares from Crescera Educacional Il,
a fund launched by Crescera Capital in 2014 together with
Bertelsmann as the lead investor.

In early September 2021, the global customer experience
company Majorel announced its intention to enter the capital
market through a private placement. The company’s shares
were traded on Euronext Amsterdam for the first time on
September 24, 2021. After the private placement of some of
its shares, Bertelsmann holds almost 40 percent of Majorel
shares, and thereby remains an important strategic share-
holder, along with Saham Group. The company will also
continue to be consolidated by Bertelsmann.

In September 2021, Fremantle, RTL Group's production
business, sold its stake in the mobile videogames company
Ludia Inc. to the US company Jam City for €144 million net of
cash disposed of.

Penguin Random House's acquisition of the book pub-
lisher Simon & Schuster from Paramount Global (formerly
ViacomCBS), which was announced at the end of 2020, is still
pending approval by the antitrust authorities. On November 2,
2021, the Department of Justice filed a suit in the US District
Court for the District of Columbia in Washington DC to block
the transaction, citing concerns about monopsony relating to
the acquisition of author rights.

In November 2021, Dominik Asam, CFO and member
of the Executive Committee at the aircraft manufacturer
Airbus SE, was appointed to the Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
Supervisory Board, effective January 1, 2022.

Results of Operations
Revenue Development

Group revenues increased in the financial year 2021 by

8.1 percent to €18.7 billion (previous year: €17.3 billion).
In addition to the recovery of the advertising-financed

2 Financial Information Combined Management Report

businesses, the positive performance of the book publish-
ing and services businesses was a key factor in this strong
revenue growth. Adjusted by exchange rate, portfolio and
other effects, the Group's organic growth was 11.4 percent.

Revenues at RTL Group recovered from the levels of the
previous year, which was defined by the effects of the corona-
virus pandemic, rising 10.3 percent to €6,637 million (previ-
ous year: €6,017 million). Organic growth was 13.5 percent.
The sustained recovery of TV advertising markets and the
growth businesses of content production and streaming were
important contributing factors in this growth. Revenues at
Penguin Random House rose 6.0 percent to €4,030 million
(previous year: €3,802 million). Organic growth was
7.3 percent. Revenue increases were recorded in all territories.
Gruner + Jahr recorded a 7.4 percent drop in revenues to
€1,051 million (previous year: €1,135 million), due primarily to
portfolio effects. Organic growth, in contrast, was positive at
13.1 percent. The advertising and circulation business
in print and digital recovered from the effects of the coronavirus
pandemic. Moreover, AppLike Group and Territory in particu-
lar recorded strong revenue growth. BMG revenues rose
10.1 percent to €663 million (previous year: €602 million).
Organic growth was 10.6 percent. Organic revenue growth
was evident both in the label and in the recording business.
Revenues at Arvato grew by 14.9 percent to €5,035 million
(previous year: €4,382 million). Organic growth was
16.8 percent. This increase in revenues was due in particular to
the positive business performance of the customer experi-
ence company Majorel and of Supply Chain Solutions.
Bertelsmann Printing Group revenues were down 3.1 percent
to €1,319 million (previous year: €1,362 million). The organic
decline was 5.5 percent. The decline is mainly down to the
closure of the gravure printing site in Nuremberg and the
general decline in the gravure and offset printing business.
Revenues at Bertelsmann Education Group declined by
6.0 percent to €283 million (previous year: €301 million)

due to portfolio and exchange-rate adjustments. Organic
growth was 6.4 percent. The investments of Bertelsmann
Investments are generally not consolidated, so revenue is not
usually reported for this division.

There were slight changes in the geographical breakdown
of revenues compared to the previous year. The share of
revenues generated in Germany was 30.6 percent compared
to 30.9 percent in the previous year. The revenue share
generated by France amounted to 11.0 percent (previous
year: 11.9 percent). In the United Kingdom, the revenue
share was 7.0 percent (previous year: 6.5 percent). The share
of total revenues generated by the other European countries
was 20.6 percent, compared to 19.3 percent in the previ-
ous year. The revenue share generated by the United States
was 23.3 percent (previous year: 24.8 percent), and the other
countries achieved a revenue share of 7.5 percent (previ-
ous year: 6.6 percent). This means that the share of total
revenues generated by foreign business rose slightly to
69.4 percent (previous year: 69.1 percent). Year on year,
there was a slight change in the ratio of the four revenue
sources (own products and merchandise, services, adver-
tising, rights and licenses) to overall revenue.

Operating EBITDA

Bertelsmann achieved a record operating EBITDA of
€3,241 million in the financial year 2021 (previous year:
€3,143 million). The previous-year period included high capital
gains from real-estate transactions. Despite that, the Group
recorded a 3.1 percent increase in earnings. Strong earnings
growth in the TV and production business, in the book
publishing business as well as in the service businesses of
Majorel and Arvato Supply Chain Solutions more than offset
ongoing expenditure on expanding the streaming area at
RTL Group. At 17.3 percent, the EBITDA margin reached
a high level once again (previous year: 18.2 percent).

Operating EBITDA at RTL Group improved on the previous
year, rising 24.1 percent to €1,361 million (previous year:
€1,097 million). This rise was primarily driven by a strong
recovery in the TV advertising markets and positive busi-
ness performance by Fremantle’s global content production
business. Operating EBITDA at Penguin Random House rose
by 9.2 percent to €755 million (previous year: €691 million),
thanks in particular to continued growth in the US business
as well as the sustained growth in audio. Operating EBITDA

at Gruner + Jahr was 5.9 percent higher at €134 million
(previous year: €127 million). The AppLike Group as well as
the advertising and sales business in particular recorded a
positive earnings performance. At BMG, operating EBITDA
grew 5.4 percent to €144 million (previous year: €137 million)
as the company profited from continued strong growth in
music streaming. Arvato recorded an operating EBITDA of
€825 million (previous year: €662 million). This increase of
24.6 percent primarily reflects continued strong earnings
growth at the customer experience company Majorel and in
the Supply Chain Solutions business area. Operating EBITDA
at Bertelsmann Printing Group rose 9.7 percent to €60 million
(previous year: €55 million). At Bertelsmann Education Group,
operating EBITDA was down 2.6 percent to €86 million
(previous year: €89 million) primarily as a result of exchange
rate effects. The investments of Bertelsmann Investments
are generally not consolidated, so operating earnings are not
usually reported for this division.

Special Items

Special items in the financial year 2021 totaled €963 million
compared to €51 million in the previous year. They consist of
impairments or reversals of impairment losses on invest-
ments accounted for using the equity method amounting to

Group Profit

The financial result was €-352 million, compared with the pre-
vious year’s amount of €-339 million. The income tax expense
increased to €-662 million compared to €-478 million in the
previous year. The change is attributable to improved earnings
before tax, among other factors. This resulted in an increase
in Group profit to €2,310 million (previous year: €1,459 mil-
lion). The share of Group profit attributable to non-controlling
interests came to €510 million (previous year: €307 million).
The share of Group profit attributable to Bertelsmann share-
holders was €1,800 million (previous year: €1,152 million).
For the financial year 2021, a dividend payout of €220 million
(previous year: €180 million) will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA.

Net Assets and Financial Position
Financing Guidelines

The primary objective of Bertelsmann’s financial policy is to
achieve a balance between financial security, return on equity
and growth. For this purpose, Bertelsmann bases its financ-
ing policy on the requirements of a “Baa1/BBB+” credit rating
and the associated qualitative and quantitative criteria. Credit
ratings and capital market transparency make a consider-
able contribution to the company’s financial security and
independence.

In accordance with the Group structure, the capital alloca-
tion is made centrally by Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA, which
provides the Group companies with liquidity and manages
the issuance of guarantees and letters of comfort for them.
The Group consists largely of a single financial unit, thereby
optimizing the raising of capital and investment opportuni-
ties.

Bertelsmann utilizes a financial control system employ-

ing quantitative financial targets concerning the Group's

economic debt and, to a lesser extent, its capital structure.
One of the financial targets is a dynamic leverage factor limited
to the defined maximum of 2.5. As of December 31, 2021,
the leverage factor was 1.3, which was below the previous
year's level (December 31, 2020: 1.9). This was mainly a result
of the decrease in economic debt.

As of December 31, 2021, economic debt decreased to
€3,475 million compared to €5,207 million in the previous
year, due to a significant decrease in net financial debt to
€959 million (December 31, 2020: €2,055 million). As of
December 31, 2021, recognized lease liabilities were
€1,356 million (December 31, 2020: €1,355 million). Provi-
sions for pensions and similar obligations were down to
€1,474 million as of December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020:
€2,009 million). In addition to a higher discount rate, the
main reason for the decrease is a voluntary addition of
€200 million to the plan assets managed in trust by
Bertelsmann Pension Trust eV.

Another financial target is the (interest) coverage ratio. This is
calculated as the ratio of operating EBITDA, used to determine
the leverage factor, to financial result, and should exceed four.
In the reporting period, the coverage ratio was 8.3 (previous
year: 8.3). The Group’s equity ratio increased to 42.8 percent
(December 31, 2020: 36.1 percent), which remains signifi-
cantly above the self-imposed minimum of 25 percent.

Financing Activities

The available liquidity was used to repay various financing
instruments ahead of schedule in the financial year 2021.
At the start of 2021, a €100 million variable interest promissory
note due in April 2023 and a €500 million bond due in
May 2021 were terminated and repaid early. Furthermore,
parts of bonds due in August 2022, October 2024 and
September 2025 totaling a nominal €428 million were repaid
ahead of schedule as part of a public repurchase offer in
May 2021. In June 2021, the revolving syndicated credit
facility was extended for a further year, until 2026.

Rating

Bertelsmann has been rated by the rating agencies Moody's
and Standard & Poor's (S&P) since 2002. The issuer ratings
facilitate access to the international capital markets and are
therefore a key element of Bertelsmann’s financial security.
Bertelsmann is rated by Moody's as “Baa2” (outlook:
stable) and by S&P as “BBB” (outlook: stable). Both credit
ratings are in the investment-grade category. Bertelsmann’s
short-term credit quality rating is “P 2” from Moody's and
“A 2" from S&P.

Credit Facilities

In addition to available liquidity, the Bertelsmann Group
has access to a syndicated credit facility with 15 banks.
This credit facility that was unutilized as of December 31,
2021, forms the backbone of the strategic credit reserve;
Bertelsmann can utilize this with a term until 2026 to draw
up to €1.2 billion of revolving funds in euros, US dollars and
pounds sterling.

Cash Flow Statement

During the reporting period, cash flow from operating
activities was generated in the amount of €1,792 million
(previous year: €2,995 million). The sustainable oper-
ating free cash flow, adjusted for special effects, was
€2,457 million (previous year: €2,571 million), and the
cash conversion rate was 107 percent (previous year:
118 percent); see also the section “Broadly Defined Perfor-
mance Indicators.” The cash flow from investing activities

was €-267 million (previous year: €-263 million). Of that
amount, €-1,699 million (previous year: €-879 million) was
attributable to investments in intangible assets, property,
plant and equipment, and financial assets. Purchase price
payments for consolidated investments (less acquired cash
and cash equivalents) were €-255 million (previous year:
€-41 million). Payments from the sales of subsidiaries
and other business units as well as of other non-current
assets were €1,687 million (previous year: €657 million).
The increase in payments represents in particular the
disposal of SpotX as well as the disposals of Prisma
Media and Ludia. The cash flow from financing activi-
ties was €-1,667 million (previous year: €330 million).
The deviation is primarily due to the repayments stated
in the section “Financing Activities.” Dividend payments
to Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA shareholders totaled
€-180 million, after the dividend payment was suspended
in the previous financial year due to the coronavirus pan-
demic. Dividends paid to non-controlling interests and
other payments to shareholders amounted to €-230 million
(previous year: €-10 million). As of December 31, 2021,
Bertelsmann had cash and cash equivalents of €4.6 billion
(previous year: €4.6 billion).

Off-Balance-Sheet Liabilities

The off-balance-sheet liabilities include contingent liabilities
and other financial commitments, almost all of which result
from operating activities conducted by the divisions. The
off-balance-sheet liabilities increased compared with the
previous year. The off-balance-sheet liabilities existing as of
December 31, 2021, had no significant negative effects on

Investments

Total investments, including acquired financial debt of €7 million
(previous year: €54 million), amounted to €1,961 million in the
financial year 2021 (previous year: €974 million). Investments
according to the cash flow statement amounted to
€1,954 million (previous year: €920 million). As in previous
years, the majority of the €327 million investments in property,
plant and equipment (previous year: €350 million) stemmed
from Arvato. Investments in intangible assets came to
€482 million (previous year: €313 million) and were primarily
attributable to RTL Group for investments in film rights and
to BMG for the acquisition of music catalogs. The sum of
€890 million was invested in financial assets (previous year:
€216 million). This includes in particular the investments in
start-ups of Bertelsmann Investments and the investment in
Afya. Purchase price payments for consolidated investments

(less acquired cash and cash equivalents) totaled €255 million
(previous year: €41 million) and relates, among others, to the
full acquisition of Super RTL.

Balance Sheet

Total assets increased to €31.7 billion as of December 31,
2021 (previous year: €29.7 billion). Cash and cash equiva-
lents totaled €4.6 billion (previous year: €4.6 billion). Equity
increased to €13.6 billion (previous year: €10.7 billion). This
resulted in an equity ratio of 42.8 percent (previous year:
36.1 percent). Equity attributable to Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA shareholders was €11.6 billion (previous year:
€9.1 billion). Provisions for pensions and similar obligations
dropped to €1,474 million (previous year: €2,009 million).
Gross financial debt totaled €5,604 million compared to
€6,626 million as of December 31, 2020. Apart from that, the
balance sheet structure remained largely unchanged from
the previous year.

Profit Participation Capital

Profit participation capital had a par value of €301 million as
of December 31, 2021, which is unchanged from the previous
year. If the effective interest method is applied, the carrying
amount of profit participation capital was €413 million as of
December 31, 2021 (previous year: €413 million). The 2001
profit participation certificates (ISIN DE0005229942) account
for 94 percent of par value of profit participation capital, while
the 1992 profit participation certificates (ISIN DE0005229900)
account for the remaining 6 percent.

The 2001 profit participation certificates are officially listed
for trading on the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt Stock

Exchange. Their price is listed as a percentage of par
value. The lowest closing rate of the 2001 profit partici-
pation certificates during the 2021 financial year was
325.00 percent in January; their highest was 365.00 percent
in December.

Under the terms and conditions of the 2001 profit partici-
pation certificates, the payout for each full financial year is
15 percent of par value, subject to the availability of sufficient
Group profit and net income at the level of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA. These conditions were met in the past financial
year. Accordingly, a payout of 15 percent of the par value of
the 2001 profit participation certificates will also be made
for the financial year 2021.

The 1992 profit participation certificates, approved for
trading on the Regulated Market in Frankfurt, only have a
limited liquid trading on the stock exchange due to their
low volume. Payouts on the 1992 profit participation
certificates are based on the Group's return on total
assets. Because the return on total assets for the financial
year 2021 was 9.88 percent (previous year: 7.65 percent),
the payout on the 1992 profit participation certificates for
the financial year 2021 will be 10.88 percent of their par
value (previous year: 8.65 percent).

The payout distribution date for both profit participation
certificates is expected to be May 10, 2022. Under the terms
and conditions of the profit participation certificates, the
auditors appointed by Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA are
responsible for verifying whether amounts to be distributed
have been calculated correctly. The auditors of both profit
participation certificates provide confirmation of this.

Performance of the Group Divisions
RTL Group

RTL Group recorded a very positive business performance.
The recovery of the advertising markets, a strong production
business and continued growth in the strategically important
streaming segment led to double-digit revenue growth. The
group also strongly increased its operating result. At the same
time, RTL Group made progress in building national cross-
media champions in Europe.

RTL Group’s revenues increased by 10.3 percent to €6.6 billion
in 2021 (previous year: €6.0 billion), and operating EBITDA
by 24.1 percent to €1.36 billion (previous year: €1.1 billion).
Organic sales growth was 13.5 percent year on year and
3.9 percent compared with the pre-pandemic level of 2019.
The EBITDA margin reached 20.5 percent, compared with
18.2 percent in the previous year.

RTL Group agreed several far-reaching consolidation moves
during the reporting period, with the aim of creating national
cross-media champions that can compete with global
technology platforms. In May 2021, RTL Group and Groupe
Bouygues agreed to merge the activities of Groupe TF1
and Groupe M6. In June, RTL Group and Talpa Network
announced plans to merge their broadcasting and media
businesses in the Netherlands. That same month, RTL Group
signed a definitive agreement to sell RTL Belgium to the
Belgian media companies DPG Media and Groupe Rossel. The
transactions are subject to reviews by the relevant authorities.
In July, RTL Deutschland acquired all remaining shares in
Super RTL, Germany's leading children’s channel. In August,
RTL Group announced that RTL Deutschland had reached
an agreement with Bertelsmann to acquire Gruner + Jahr’s
German publishing businesses and brands. The cooperation
was further strengthened in the months that followed,
culminating in the completion of the combination to form the
enlarged RTL Deutschland entity on January 1, 2022.

The streaming services RTL+ (formerly TV Now) in Germany
and Videoland in the Netherlands together recorded 3.8 million
paying subscribers at the end of the year, 73.8 percent
more than a year earlier. Streaming revenues increased by
30.9 percent to €223 million (previous year: €170 million).

Groupe M6 and RTL Nederland increased their audience
shares as their information and entertainment programs
scored high ratings. The combined audience share of RTL
Deutschland’s channels decreased slightly, partly because the
popular European soccer championship was broadcast by the
public broadcasters in the summer.

RTL Group increased its shareholding in several production
companies in 2021. Fremantle also expanded its position in

20 Financial Information Combined Management Report

the Scandinavian market with the acquisition of 12 production
companies from Nordic Entertainment Group. RTL Group
generated a high capital gain from the sale of SpotX to the
US ad tech company Magnite. The mobile video games
subsidiary Ludia was sold to the US company Jam City.

Fremantle strongly increased its revenues during the reporting
period, fueled in part by the delivery of the high-end drama
series “American Gods” (third season) to Amazon Prime
and “The Mosquito Coast” to Apple TV+, as well as the film
production “The Hand of God” for Netflix that was nominated
for an Oscar. Fremantle also expanded its global production
business with a new unit for high-end documentaries.

Penguin Random House

Penguin Random House increased its revenues and operating
result in 2021, thanks to numerous successful new releases,
robust backlist sales and continued high demand for digital
audiobooks. Penguin Random House generated €4.0 billion
in revenues during the reporting year, up 6.0 percent from the
previous year's €3.8 billion. Operating EBITDA rose 9.2 percent
to €755 million (previous year: €691 million). The EBITDA margin
increased to 18.7 percent (previous year: 18.2 percent).

The year's best-selling books included backlist titles such as
“Atomic Habits” by James Clear, with more than 3.5 million copies
sold by its English-language and German publishers across
all formats, “Greenlights” by Matthew McConaughey, which
sold nearly two million additional copies in print, e-book and
audiobook, and “A Promised Land,” the first volume of Barack
Obama's presidential memoirs. The most popular new publica-
tions included “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster” by Bill Gates
and three volumes of poetry by Amanda Gorman, which together
sold more than one million copies following the poet's high-
profile reading at the inauguration of US President Joe Biden.

Penguin Random House publishers each placed numerous
titles on the bestseller lists of the “New York Times” in the
United States, the “Sunday Times” in the United Kingdom and
“Spiegel” in Germany. The publishing group established new
publishing imprints in several markets.

In May, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)
approved Penguin Random House's proposed acquisition of
Simon & Schuster; a US Department of Justice challenge to the
deal is scheduled to be heard in the US federal court during
the financial year 2022.

The book group continued its investments in distribution and ful-
fill ment logistics in 2021. This enabled Penguin Random House
to meet rising demand for its titles despite significant pandemic-
related production and delivery bottlenecks, while at the same
time offering more efficient delivery times to book retailers.
Penguin Random House also advanced the capturing of con-
sumer data in order to expand its direct-to-consumer marketing.

Penguin Random House US enjoyed a successful publishing
and business year. Its biggest bestseller was “Atomic Habits”
by James Clear, published in 2018; new releases such as “The
Judge’s List” by John Grisham, “The 1619 Project” created by
Nikole Hannah-Jones and the New York Times Magazine, and
“Go Tell the Bees That | Am Gone” by Diana Gabaldon also
achieved high sales.

In the British book market, Penguin Random House UK was
successful with titles such as “The Thursday Murder Club”
and “The Man Who Died Twice” by Richard Osman,

“The Very Hungry Caterpillar” by Eric Carle and, again,
“Atomic Habits” by James Clear. Penguin Random House
Grupo Editorial benefited from continued growth in online sales
and a strong backlist catalog. Top titles included “El Italiano” by
Arturo Pérez-Reverte and “De Ninguna Parte” by Julia Navarro.
The Spanish-language publishing group founded Penguin Kids,
and also strengthened its position in the children’s and
young adult book segment with the acquisition of the Molino
publishing house. It merged its Portuguese publishing activities
with Editora 20/20 to form the new Penguin Random House
Grupo Editorial Portugal.

In the German-speaking countries, Penguin Random House
Verlagsgruppe maintained its leading market position;
online sales in particular increased. Best-selling titles in their
respective categories were “Uber Menschen” by Juli Zeh (fiction
hardcover), “Das Kind in Dir muss Heimat finden” by Stefanie
Stahl (nonfiction paperback) and “Der Gesang der Flusskrebse”
by Delia Owens (fiction paperback).

Gruner + Jahr

Gruner + Jahr had a successful year. Revenues declined by
7.4 percent to €1.05 billion (previous year: €1.14 billion),
mainly as a result of the divestment of Prisma Media in France.
Operating EBITDA increased by 5.9 percent to €134 million
(previous year: €127 million). The EBITDA margin improved
to 12.7 percent (previous year: 11.2 percent). The business
achieved strong organic growth in its revenues and earnings.

This positive business performance was driven by a significant
year-on-year recovery in Gruner + Jahr’s advertising business,
as well as strong revenue and earnings growth at the AppLike
Group and high investment income at the Spiegel Group. The
share contributed by the digital businesses to total revenues
in Germany rose to over 50 percent. Territory contributed to
this success with strong revenue and earnings growth, as did
DDV Mediengruppe.

As a member of the Bertelsmann Content Alliance,
Gruner + Jahr was involved in the development of numerous
new content formats. For example, "Stern," RTL and ntv
launched the weekday podcast “heute wichtig” (“important
today”). Vox and Stern are working together on a long-term
report on the consequences of the flood disaster in the
Ahr Valley. Gruner + Jahr also became involved in the content
alliance initiative “JAhr zur Wahrheit” for independent
journalism.

In August 2021, it was announced that RTL Deutschland would
take over Gruner + Jahr’s German magazine businesses and
brands. The transaction was completed on January 1, 2022.
Gruner + Jahr’s other activities, such as Territory, the AppLike
Group, the DDV Media Group and the stake in the Spiegel
Group, will remain with Bertelsmann and will be assigned to
the Bertelsmann Investments division from now on.

BMG

Bertelsmann’s music subsidiary BMG increased both its
revenues and its operating result in 2021. Its label business
in particular recorded dynamic operational growth, but it
also significantly expanded its publishing business. Overall,
BMG increased its revenues by 10.1 percent to €663 million
(previous year: €602 million). In the label business, BMG
benefited from high revenues from music streaming and
strong physical music sales, while in the publishing business,
growing digital revenues more than offset the pandemic-
related decline in revenues from the live sector. BMG’s
operating EBITDA was €144 million, up by 5.4 percent over
the previous year (€137 million). The EBITDA margin was
21.7 percent (previous year: 22.7 percent). The revenue share
contributed by the digital businesses to BMG’s total revenue
increased to 63 percent (previous year: 60 percent).

In March 2021, BMG and the private equity firm KKR joined
forces with a view to acquiring major music rights packages.
Initial deals included the acquisition of rights from rock band
ZZ Top and R&B star John Legend. BMG also independently
acquired an extensive portfolio of rights from Tina Turner, one
of the most popular artists in pop music history, and the entire
music catalog of US rock band Motley Crile. For BMG, this
was the largest single catalog acquisition since its founding
in 2008.

In the label business, BMG released successful new works
by AJR, Billy Idol, Carlos Santana, Duran Duran, Garbage,
Iron Maiden, Jason Aldean, KSI, Pat Metheny and
Van Morrison, among others. Catalogue highlights included
releases by Mick Fleetwood & Friends, Motdrhead,
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, and Buena Vista Social Club.
BMG signed new recording contracts with artists including
5 Seconds of Summer, Bryan Adams, Carlos Santana, JLS,
Maxwell, Duran Duran and No Angels.

In the publishing business, DJ Khaled, Iron Maiden, Inhaler
and RAF Camora released new albums that soared to number
one in various markets. BMG songwriter Tyron Hapi co-wrote
“Astronaut in the Ocean” (with Masked Wolf), the most-
used song in 2021 on TikTok and Shazam. Singer/songwriter
Diane Warren won a Golden Globe for Best Original Song for
“lo Si (Seen),” while songwriter and producer D'Mile won an
Academy Award for Best Original Song for “Fight for You”
(with H.E.R.) and a Grammy Award for Song of the Year for
“| Can't Breathe” (with H.E.R). Alongside D'Mile, Scorpions,
John Legend and the Juice WRLD Estate renewed their
long-term publishing contracts; Max Giesinger added a
publishing deal to his label contract.

BMG entered into a long-term, exclusive agreement with
Netflix to manage the video streaming service’s music

publishing rights for all countries outside the United States.
It also announced a partnership with online gaming platform
Roblox to open up the platform to develop opportunities
for BMG artists and songwriters. BMG expanded into live
music by acquiring KARO, the concert agency that organizes
Germany's renowned Taubertal Festival.

The Bertelsmann music subsidiary continued to advocate for
fairness and transparency in the music industry, e.g., for more
justice in the streaming business. The Black Music Action
Coalition lauded BMG in the inaugural “Music Industry Action
Report Card” for its initiative to review the contractual terms
of Black artists in acquired music catalogs and to correct
unequal payments.

Arvato

Bertelsmann’s services activities, which are combined in the
Arvato division, once again saw a very gratifying business
performance in 2021. The main drivers were the logistics
businesses, which benefited from booming e-commerce
businesses, and the global customer experience company
Majorel, which expanded its business relationships with
global Internet customers in particular. Arvato's growing
IT businesses also contributed to the positive business
performance. Against this backdrop, Arvato grew its
revenues by 14.9 percent to €5.0 billion (previous year:
€4.4 billion). Operating EBITDA reached a new record,
increasing by 24.6 percent to €825 million (previous year:
€662 million).

Arvato Supply Chain Solutions’ logistics services businesses
grew profitably in fiscal year 2021, especially internationally.
In Asia and in Spain, Arvato Supply Chain Solutions increased
its revenues by 40 percent, and in the United States, Poland,
the United Kingdom, Russia and Turkey by around 30 percent.
The Solution Group continued to benefit from the accelerated
shift in global trade towards e-commerce. To keep up with
this dynamic growth, Arvato Supply Chain Solutions further
strengthened its global network of locations by establishing
new distribution centers and expanding existing ones in
Europe and the United States. Based on its strong market
position, the Solution Group invested extensively in state-
of-the-art automation technology and the expansion of its
cloud infrastructure. In addition, Arvato SCS | DIGITAL, a new
operating unit with nearly 300 employees, was established
to drive the digitalization strategy and systematically develop
new digital solutions and products for customers at all levels
of collaboration.

Revenues from Arvato’s financial services businesses
declined slightly in the period under review. This is mainly due
to a change in the portfolio, relating to the sale of 60 percent
of the risk management business to the information
services provider Experian in 2020. By contrast, the “Pay after
Delivery” business saw a positive business performance
and grew in fiscal year 2021. Arvato Financial Solutions’
operating result was additionally impacted by government
regulations in the receivables management business in its
core market of Germany.

The IT services provider Arvato Systems grew strongly in
fiscal year 2021 with new customers, primarily from the
public sector, and existing customers in particular from
the healthcare sector. It further developed its business
with proprietary products and platforms and_ strongly
expanded the cloud business. The intensification of strategic
partnerships with major international software and Internet
groups contributed to this. As IT security plays an important

24 Financial Information Combined Management Report

role, Arvato Systems became a member of the Microsoft
Intelligent Security Association (MISA) in 2021, to be able to
deploy security solutions for customers even more rapidly.
Arvato Systems won various business awards during the
reporting period, which underscored both the company’s
expertise and its market perception as a partner for the
transformation to digital.

The global experience company Majorel
noticeably increased both its revenue and operating result
during the 2021 financial year. This development was
driven by the strong growth with global Internet clients and
continued growth with existing clients while also winning
new clients. A private placement of approximately 20 percent
of the Company's share capital to institutional investors
was completed in September 2021. The Company's shares
were subsequently listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock
exchange on September 24, 2021.

Bertelsmann Printing Group

Besides declining rotogravure and offset markets, Bertelsmann
Printing Group (BPG) also faced significant price increases for
paper, production materials and energy over the past financial
year, particularly in the second half of the year. Its replication,
letterpress and direct marketing businesses developed
positively. Due to the closure of Prinovis’s rotogravure printing
site in Nuremberg and the structurally declining rotogravure
and offset printing business, revenues were down 3.1 percent
year on year to €1.32 billion (previous year: €1.36 billion).
Operating EBITDA increased by 9.7 percent to €60 million
(previous year: €55 million). At 4.5 percent, the division's
EBITDA margin was also above the previous year’s level.

The German print businesses declined overall in fiscal year
2021. This was mainly due to the closure of the rotogravure
printing site in Nuremberg and other market-related declines
in sales at Prinovis and at Europe’s leading offset printing
company, Mohn Media. Mohn Media was able to partially
compensate for lower capacity utilization, particularly in the
catalog and brochure segment, as well as the considerable
increase in raw material prices, thanks to comprehensive cost-
cutting measures and higher revenues for used materials,
among other things. GGP Media, a printing company that
specializes in the production of books, was able to consolidate
its leading market position thanks to high demand in the
softcover and hardcover segments and grew profitably in
financial year 2021.

The direct marketing and digital businesses in Germany,
Austria and Switzerland improved their overall revenues
and earnings year on year. DeutschlandCard's business in
particular saw strong growth, mainly due to the acquisition of
several new partners and the further digitization of subscriber
communications. Dialog’s multichannel marketing businesses
and Campaign's campaign-management services achieved a
significant to strong improvement in revenues, while earnings
remained stable.

International print activities demonstrated a_ variable
performance in the past financial year. While Prinovis in the
United Kingdom made capacity adjustments during the year
due to the loss of a customer, BPG's letterpress activities
in the United States grew overall. The book printing sites
in Fairfield and Martinsburg, which were acquired at the end
of 2020, were integrated as planned. In addition, organizational
structures were standardized, processes were optimized
along integrated value chains and investments in modern
production facilities promise to bring a performance boost for
major publishing customers in the future.

The replication and packaging specialists at BPG performed
very well in a market that continued to decline, and were

able to increase revenues strongly, particularly through the
acquisition of a major entertainment customer. The business
with sustainable packaging solutions for the food industry
also grew.

Bertelsmann Education Group

The Bertelsmann Education Group achieved organic growth
in 2021 but, taking portfolio and exchange rate effects into
account, recorded a decline in revenues. The operating result
dipped slightly due to exchange rate effects; adjusted for
these effects, the previous year's level was reached despite
increased investments in technology and product improve-
ments. Both Relias, the e-learning provider specializing in
healthcare training and continuing education, and Alliant
International University, with its growing range of online
courses, benefited from rising demand — partly in the context
of the coronavirus pandemic.

Bertelsmann’s education businesses generated total revenues
of €283 million (previous year: €301 million, -6.0 percent).
The decline is due to the divestment of the US university
services provider HotChalk at the end of 2020; organically,
the Bertelsmann Education Group grew by 6.4 percent
in the year under review. Operating EBITDA amounted to
€86 million, down 2.6 percent from the previous year's
figure of €89 million. The EBITDA margin was again high at
30.6 percent (previous year: 29.5 percent).

Relias is increasingly focusing on digitized, cloud-based and
data-driven educational formats to strengthen its market
leadership in training and continuing education for healthcare
professionals in the United States. The company expanded
its investments in tech innovations as well as the product
portfolio accordingly in 2021. For example, in view of acute
staff shortages in nursing and eldercare in the United States,
a “Home Health Aide Certification Program” was developed
that quickly and efficiently qualifies people for home care
based on new online learning methods. In November, Relias
added a training series to its program that helps hospitals
manage more efficiently the entire revenue cycle, from initial
patient encounters to claims management. The company
also continued to offer free COVID-19 prevention courses
worldwide.

Alliant International University, which specializes in psychology
and education, recorded an increase in student numbers. It
continued to expand its online course offerings in 2021, with
about half of all students taking online courses. The university
received an eight-year accreditation reaffirmation from the
WASC Senior College and University Commission in March,
confirming the high quality of its degree programs.

The online continuing education platform Udacity, in which
Bertelsmann owns a significant stake, expanded its course
offerings to include cybersecurity programs, among other
things, in order to meet the growing demand from companies
and government agencies for qualified specialists in this field.

26 Financial Information Combined Management Report

Bertelsmann again offered 15,000 scholarships for Udacity
courses in the areas of cloud, data and Al as part of its
three-year #50000Chances program to counter the short-
age of IT specialists. In response, 47,300 applications from
190 countries were received in the reporting year.

Bertelsmann Investments

Bertelsmann Investments (BI) expanded its start-up and fund
network in 2021 to 290 active investments with a total of
57 new and 42 follow-on investments, and realized several
exits. EBIT reached a new record at €316 million (previous
year: €1 million), mainly due to capital gains and strong
increases in the value of the holdings.

Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments (BDMI) made
31 new investments and 11 follow-on investments, including
in Rally Rd, a blockchain-based trading platform for trading
shares in collectibles, and in Infinite Objects, a non-fungible
token (NFT)-based video printing provider. BDMI also made
seven follow-on investments. The New York City-based fund
recorded successful exits with the sale of its holdings in
the portfolio companies Vimeo, a leading video creation
platform, and Barkbox, a Nasdaq-listed e-commerce platform
for dog owners.

Bertelsmann Asia Investments (BAI) made 22
investments in fiscal year 2021, including in Innovusion, the
leading developer of technology for laser-based distance
sensors in autonomous driving vehicles, the NFT platform
TR Lab and the crypto trading platform Babel Finance.
BAI also invested in the pharmatech platform NeoX and
in Yahaha, an open-source video game platform. Four
BAI portfolio companies went public: Linklogis, Dingdong
Fresh, NetEase Cloud Music and SF Intra-City. BAl made
follow-on investments in 23 companies, including Stori, the
leading digital bank in Latin America.

new

During the reporting period, Bertelsmann India Investments
(Bll) made an investment in Skeps, an innovative blockchain-
based lending platform for merchants and lenders. BIl also
continued to focus on strengthening its portfolio by making
follow-on investments in seven of its portfolio companies. These
included Shiprocket, which helps small businesses manage and
track their end-to-end logistics processes. Following another
profitable partial exit, BIl retains a stake in the executive
education company Eruditus, which has now reached a valuation
of around €2.7 billion.

In Brazil, Bertelsmann completed the acquisition of 25 percent
of the capital shares and 46 percent of the voting rights in the
listed education company Afya. Afya is a leading provider of
medical education and training in Brazil. Bertelsmann acquired
the shares from Crescera Educacional Il, a fund launched in 2014
by Crescera Capital with Bertelsmann as the main investor. Afya
will be further expanded together with the Esteves founding
family, which holds 24 percent of the shares and 45 percent of
the voting rights, and the company’s successful management
team. The dynamic development of the Brazilian venture capital
market is reflected in the increase in value of BBI’s investments
in Monashees Capital V and Redpoint Eventures.

Bertelsmann Investments (BI) invested in four more funds,
including another fund from the Berlin-based venture capital firm
Greenfield One, the Cathay Africlnvest Innovation Fund and TIDE
Africa Fund II focusing on Africa, and the Vertex Growth Fund II
focusing on Southeast Asia.

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2021 27

General Statement by Company Management
on the Economic Situation

In the financial year 2021, Bertelsmann recorded successful
business development and exceeded the revenue and profit
levels of the period before the outbreak of the coronavirus
pandemic. Its strong financial performance with new record
results puts Bertelsmann in a position to invest substantial
funds in further growth in the future.

Group revenues in the reporting period rose strongly by
8.1 percent to €18.7 billion from €17.3 billion in the previous
year, thereby exceeding expectations (forecast in the 2020
Annual Report: moderate increase in revenues). Organic
revenue growth was 11.4 percent. At €3,241 million, operating
EBITDA was 3.1 percent above the previous year's high level
of €3,143 million, which also included high capital gains from
real-estate transactions (forecast in the 2020 Annual Report:
sharp decline in operating EBITDA). Without the capital gains
from real-estate transactions recorded in the previous year,
there would have been a strong rise in operating EBITDA
(forecast in the 2020 Annual Report: stable development). The
significant positive divergence from the projected earnings
development is attributable to the swifter recovery of
advertising markets and the more positive development of
the book publishing and services businesses. At €474 million,
the BVA used for Group management was strongly above the
previous year's figure of €355 million (forecast in the 2020
Annual Report: strongly declining BVA). The development
reflects the significant improvement in the operating profit.
The operating earnings of RTL Group grew strongly as the
European TV advertising markets recovered as expected
(forecast in the 2020 Annual Report: earnings strongly above
the previous year's figure).

In 2021, Bertelsmann set the course for a Group-wide growth
initiative. The five new strategic priorities were presented at
the beginning of the year: National Media Champions, Global
Content, Global Services, Online Education and Investments.
The Bertelsmann businesses defined their respective growth
ambitions and function as drivers of a Group-wide surge in
growth. In terms of the strategy’s implementation so far, the
planned mergers of Groupe M6 and Groupe TF1 in France,
and of RTL Nederland and Talpa in the Netherlands, as well
as the combination of RTL Deutschland and the German
magazine businesses and brands of Gruner + Jahr, which
was completed in early 2022, will create national cross-
media champions in Europe. As of the end of the 2021
financial year, the streaming services RTL+ in Germany and
Videoland in the Netherlands alone had 3.8 million paying
subscribers, representing growth of almost 74 percent.

28 Financial Information Combined Management Report

Furthermore, acquisitions in the book publishing and
TV production business have helped to expand Bertels-
mann's global content businesses and drive forward BMG
and KKR’s collaboration for purchasing music catalogs. The
global services business was further strengthened through
the consistent implementation of the growth strategy.
This involved acquisitions as well as establishing additional
locations. In 2021, Majorel acquired the CX consultancy
firm Junokai, one of the leading independent customer
experience consulting companies in the DACH region.
The US book printing business was also strengthened.
The online education division saw significant expansion
with the acquisition of shares in the Brazilian education
company Afya. Meanwhile, Bertelsmann Investments
continued to invest in young companies and funds around
the world.

Net assets and financial position remain strong. At 1.3, the
leverage factor in the reporting period was below the previous
year’s level (December 31, 2020: 1.9). As of December 31, 2021,
the cash and cash equivalents were reported at €4.6 billion
(December 31, 2020: €4.6 billion). The rating agencies Moody's
and S&P currently rate Bertelsmann as “Baa2” and “BBB,”
respectively, with a stable outlook.

Alternative Performance Measures

In this Combined Management Report, the following Alternative
Performance Measures, which are not defined in accordance
with IFRS, are used to explain the results of operations and/
or net assets and financial position. These should not be
considered in isolation but as complementary information
for evaluating Bertelsmann’‘s business situation, and they
are differentiated in terms of strictly defined and broadly
defined key performance indicators, in the same way as in the
value-oriented management system.

Organic Revenue Growth

The organic growth is calculated by adjusting the
reported revenue growth for the impact of exchange rate
effects, corporate acquisitions and disposals, as well as
other effects. When determining the exchange rate effects,
the functional currency that is valid in the respective country
is used. The other effects include changes in methods and
presentation, for example.

Operating EBITDA

Operating EBITDA is determined as earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation, amortization, and impairment losses and reversals
of impairment losses, and is adjusted for special items. The
adjustments for special items serve to determine a sustainable
operating result that could be repeated under normal economic
circumstances and is not affected by special factors or structural
distortions. These special items primarily include impairment losses
and reversals of impairment losses, fair value measurements,
restructuring expenses and/or results from disposals of invest-
ments. This means operating EBITDA is a meaningful performance
indicator. Not included in the special items are disposal effects of
real estate transactions. To preclude a double adjustment, amorti-
zation/depreciation, impairment and reversals already included in
the special items are eliminated by means of a correction.

BVA

BVA measures the profit realized above and beyond the
appropriate return on invested capital. This form of value

orientation is reflected in strategic investment and portfolio
planning and in the management of operations and, together
with qualitative criteria, provides the basis for measuring the
variable portion of management remuneration. BVA is used
for control essentially at the Group level. BVA is calculated as
the difference between net operating profit after tax (NOPAT)
and the cost of capital. NOPAT is calculated on the basis of
operating EBITDA. The NOPAT figure used to calculate BVA
is determined by deducting depreciation and amortization,
provided that they are not included in special items, and a flat
30 percent tax. Cost of capital is the product of the weighted
average cost of capital (WACC) and the average level of capital
invested. The uniform WACC after taxes is 8 percent. The
average invested capital is calculated quarterly on the basis
of the Group's operating assets less non-interest-bearing
operating liabilities. BVA is determined without taking into
account the Bertelsmann Investments division, since business
performance is represented primarily on the basis of EBIT.
Accordingly, the method does not include a NOPAT contribution
from this division. To maintain consistency, the invested
capital will be adjusted for the Bertelsmann Investment
division; hence, capital costs will be neutralized.

Cash Conversion Rate

The cash conversion rate serves as a measure of cash
generated from business activities and is calculated as the ratio
of operating free cash flow to operating EBIT. The operating
free cash flow is determined on the basis of the cash flow from
operating activities as reported in the consolidated cash flow

statement, whereby the impact of paid income taxes and
the change in provisions for pensions and similar obligations
on cash flow from operating activities is offset. Operating
free cash flow is also reduced by investments in intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment as well as lease
payments, and increased by proceeds from the sale of non-
current assets. Further adjustments are made to ensure an
allocation of capital flows to the relevant periods, and to offset
the impact of payment flows resulting from special items on
the operating free cash flow in a way that is methodically
consistent with operating EBITDA. Operating EBITDA is used
to calculate operating EBIT by deducting amortization and
depreciation, provided that these are not included in special
items. The Group aims to maintain a cash conversion rate of
90 percent to 100 percent as a long-term average.

current and non-current financial debt, minus cash and

debt less the 50 percent par value component of the hybrid
bonds and investments in a special fund of 2021 that can be
converted into cash at short notice (see also section “Minority
Stakes and Other Financial Assets” in the Notes), plus
provisions for pensions, profit participation capital and lease
liabilities. In calculating economic debt, the hybrid bonds are
taken into account only at 50 percent, as both bonds are
classified by the rating agencies as 50 percent equity.
Economic debt is modified for the purposes of calculating the
leverage factor.

Leverage Factor

One of the financial targets is a dynamic leverage factor
calculated as the ratio of economic debt to operating EBITDA;
this factor should not regularly exceed the defined maximum
of 2.5. In determining the leverage factor, the economic debt

management that corresponds to the Group's structure. The
modifications in regard to the economic debt largely relate to
cash and cash equivalents, which are tied up in the Group,
while the modifications in regard to the operating EBITDA

conservative than the figure that would be obtained using only
the items recognized in the balance sheet.

Significant Events after the Balance Sheet Date

In November 2021, Majorel signed an agreement for
the acquisition of 80 percent of the shares in Mayen
Telekomtnikasyon Hizmetleri A.S., a company based in Turkey.
An advance payment of €58 million was already made as of
December 31, 2021. The acquisition date is January 1, 2022.

In January 2022, parts of bonds due in August 2022, October
2024, September 2025 and April 2026 in a total nominal
amount of €146 million were repaid early as part of a public
repurchase offer.

Also in January 2022, RTL Group sold its stake in the US

advertising technology company VideoAmp. RTL Group
held 8.57 percent of the company’s shares, which it sold for

US$104 million in cash. The transaction was carried out as
a share buyback by VideoAmp.

In February 2022, RTL Group announced that it had signed
a definitive agreement for the sale of its Croatian business,
RTL Croatia, to Central European Media Enterprises (CME).
In addition to the purchase price of €50 million, RTL Group
also receives payments through a long-term brand licensing
agreement with CME. The sale is subject to the approval
of the responsible antitrust authorities. The transaction is
expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.

In March 2022, Bertelsmann announced that it had entered
into a term sheet with the main co-investors, the Esteves
family and NRE Capital Ventures Ltd., regarding the offer to
acquire 6 million additional Class B shares of the investment
in Afya Ltd. held by the Bertelsmann Investments division as
an associate. The binding offer, the acceptance of which by
Bertelsmann is subject to due diligence and approval by the
relevant boards, is based on a price per share of US$26.90
and is valid until April 15, 2022.

In March 2022, Fremantle acquired 70 percent of Lux Vide,
Italy's leading independent television production company.
The acquisition of Lux Vide forms part of Fremantle’s
wider international growth strategy to invest in premium
production companies, content creators and talent from
around the world — developing and securing original formats
and unmissable IP. The transaction will be accounted for
as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3. At
the time the Consolidated Financial Statements were
prepared, the purchase price allocation was at a very
preliminary stage.

Risks and Opportunities

Risk Management System

The purpose of the Bertelsmann risk management system
(RMS) is the early identification and evaluation of, as well as
response to, internal and external risks. The internal control
system (ICS), an integral component of the RMS, monitors
the effectiveness of the risk response measures that have
been implemented. The aim of the RMS is to identify, at an
early stage, material risks to the Group so that risk response
measures can be taken and controls implemented. Risks
are possible future developments or events that could
result in a negative deviation from the outlook or objectives
for Bertelsmann. In addition, risks can negatively affect the
achievement of the Group’s strategic, operational, reporting
and compliance-related objectives and its reputation.

The risk management process is based on the internationally
accepted frameworks of the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO Enter-
prise Risk Management — Integrated Framework and Internal
Control — Integrated Framework, respectively) and is orga-
nized in the subprocesses of identification, assessment,
response, control, communication and monitoring. A major
element of risk identification is a risk inventory that lists sig-
nificant risks year by year, from the profit-center level upward.
These risks are aggregated step by step at the division and
Group levels. This ensures that risks are registered where their
impact would be felt. There is also a Group-wide reassessment
of critical risks every six months, and quarterly reporting in
case the risk situation has changed. Ad hoc reporting require-
ments ensure that significant changes in the risk situation
during the course of the year are brought to the attention of
the Executive Board. The risks are compared to risk response
and control measures to determine the net risk position. Both
one- and three-year risk assessment horizons are applied to
enable the timely implementation of risk response measures.
The basis for determining the main Group risks is the three-
year period, similar to medium-term corporate planning.
Risk assessment is the product of the estimated negative
impact on Group free cash flow should the risk occur, and
the estimated probability of occurrence. Risk monitoring is
conducted by Group management on an ongoing basis. The
RMS, along with its component ICS, is constantly undergoing
further development and is integrated into ongoing reporting
to the Bertelsmann Executive Board and Supervisory Board.
Corporate Risk Management Committee meetings are con-
vened at regular intervals to ensure compliance with statutory
and internal requirements.

32 Financial Information Combined Management Report

The Group auditor inspects the risk early-warning system
for its capacity to identify developments early on that could
threaten the existence of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA accord-
ing to section 91(2) of Germany's Stock Corporation Act
(AktG), and then reports the findings to the Supervisory Board
of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. Corporate Audit conducts
ongoing reviews of the adequacy and functional capability of
the RMS in all divisions apart from RTL Group and Majorel.
The RMS of RTL Group and of Majorel is evaluated by the
respective internal auditing department and by the external
auditor. Any issues that are identified are promptly remedied
through appropriate measures. The Bertelsmann Executive
Board defined the scope and focus of the RMS based on the
specific circumstances of the company. However, even an
appropriately designed and functional RMS cannot guarantee
with absolute certainty that risks will be identified and
controlled.

Accounting-Related Risk Management System and Internal
Control System

The objectives of the accounting-related RMS and ICS are
to ensure that external and internal accounting are proper
and reliable in accordance with applicable laws, and that
information is made available without delay to the various
recipients. Reporting should also present a true and fair
view of Bertelsmann’s net assets, financial position and
results of operations. The following statements pertain to the
Consolidated Financial Statements (including the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the
Combined Management Report), interim reporting and
internal management reporting.

The ICS for the accounting process consists of the following
areas. The Group’s internal rules for accounting and the
preparation of financial statements (e.g., IFRS manual,
guidelines and circulars) are made available without delay
to all employees involved in the accounting process. The
Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in a report-
ing system that is uniform throughout the Group. Extensive
automatic system controls ensure the consistency of the
data in the financial statements. The system is subject
to ongoing development through a documented change
process. Systematized processes for coordinating intercom-
pany transactions serve to prepare the corresponding con-
solidation steps. Circumstances that could lead to significant
misinformation in the Consolidated Financial Statements
are monitored centrally by employees of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA, and then verified by external experts as required.


--- Page 30 ---

Central contact persons from Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
and the divisions are also in continuous contact with local
subsidiaries to ensure IFRS-compliant accounting as well as
compliance with reporting deadlines and obligations. These
preventive measures are supplemented by specific controls in
the form of automated and manual analyses by the Corporate
Financial Reporting department of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA. The purpose of such analyses is to identify any
remaining inconsistencies. The controlling departments at
the Group and division levels are also integrated into the
internal management reporting. Internal and external report-
ing are reconciled during the segment reconciliation pro-
cess. The further aim in introducing a globally binding control
framework for the decentralized accounting processes is to
achieve a standardized ICS format at the level of the local
accounting departments of all fully consolidated Group
companies. The findings of the external auditors, Corporate
Audit and the internal auditing departments of RTL Group
and Majorel are promptly discussed with the affected com-
panies, and solutions are developed. An annual self-assess-
ment is conducted to establish reporting on the quality of
the ICS in the key fully consolidated Group companies. The
findings are discussed at the divisional level. Like the RMS,
each ICS cannot guarantee with absolute certainty that
significant misinformation in the accounting process can be
prevented or identified.

Corporate Audit and the internal auditing departments of
RTL Group and Majorel evaluate the accounting-related

processes as part of their auditing work. As part of the auditing
process, the Group auditor also reports to the Audit and
Finance Committee of the Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
Supervisory Board about any significant vulnerabilities of the
accounting-related ICS that were identified during the audit,
and the findings regarding the risk early-warning system.

Major Risks to the Group

Bertelsmann is exposed to a variety of risks. The major risks to
Bertelsmann identified in the risk reporting are listed in order
of priority in the table below. In line with the level of possible
financial loss, the risks are classified as low, moderate,
significant, considerable or endangering. The risk inventory
carried out did not identify any risks that would be classified as
considerable or endangering. The determination of risk-bearing
capacity at Group level using a Monte Carlo simulation also
shows that no endangering situation can be identified since
there is sufficient liquidity to cover risk.

Given the diversity of the businesses in which Bertelsmann
is active, and the corresponding diversity of risks to which
the various divisions are exposed, the key strategic and
operational risks to the Group that have been identified are
specified below. Risks from acquisitions were identified as
higher-level risks, and are therefore described separately. This is
followed by an outline of legal and regulatory risks, information
security risks and financial market risks. These risks are largely
managed at the corporate level.

Strategic and Operational Risks

The global economy recovered after the pandemic-driven
downturn in the previous year. Real gross domestic product
(GDP) rose 5.5 percent, after falling 3.5 percent in 2020.
In 2021, global economic development was once again
driven largely by the coronavirus pandemic. However, the
strong upturn was accompanied in many countries by price
increases and supply bottlenecks. Continued economic
recovery is subject to a particularly high degree of uncertainty.
The future course of the pandemic, ongoing supply bottle-
necks and inflation, which has risen sharply, are key factors that
could dampen economic activity. The negative effects on the
global economy arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine
and the resulting continued increase of the geopolitical
tension are not yet foreseeable. Bertelsmann’s business
development is also subject to other macroeconomic risks.
Brexit has resulted in continued economic challenges for
individual businesses. Bertelsmann has been observing and
analyzing the exit process since 2016, and will take targeted
measures to mitigate risk for the affected businesses. Even
though the negative effect of the coronavirus pandemic on
Bertelsmann’s businesses in 2021 was less significant than
expected, especially as regards the advertising-financed busi-
nesses of RTL Group and Gruner + Jahr, there is ongoing
uncertainty regarding the impact of new developments in the
coronavirus pandemic. In addition, the structural decline in
the printing businesses continues. The printing and services
businesses in particular are significantly affected by rising
staff and material costs. It is largely possible to transfer this
upwards pressure on prices, but only with a time delay in
some cases. Additional cost measures will be required in
individual divisions as part of the offsetting measures. In the
short and medium term, negative economic developments,
legal and regulatory risks, a changing market environment,
supplier and customer risks, reduced audience and market
shares, and drops in prices and margins all represent signifi-
cant Group risks. How these risks develop depends to a large
extent on changes in customer behavior due to factors such
as the continued digitalization, the development and imple-
mentation of products and services by competitors, bad debt
losses, and default and interference along the production
chains in individual sectors. Information security and financial
market risks represent moderate risks for Bertelsmann.
Risks related to employees are classified as low in the three-
year period under review. The information security risks
integrated into the overview of key Group risks for the first
time replace the risks from technological change. The risks
from technological change are still classified as low.

34 Financial Information Combined Management Report

A substantial risk for RTL Group is the dependency of
advertising markets on the economic situation. If the
it may
accelerated decline in the advertising market, with direct

coronavirus pandemic continues, lead to an
effects on RTL Group earnings. RTL Group responds to such
economic downturns with ongoing monitoring of market
development, planning various scenarios and strict cost
control. Furthermore, RTL Group aims to secure advertising
revenue through the active expansion of addressable TV and
to widen its earning base by finding sources of income that
are not dependent on advertising. Increasing competition
and constant change, particularly in the digital environment,
are resulting in a stronger fragmentation of RTL Group's
markets as audiences increasingly use non-linear TV products
amid a growing number of streaming services. The possible
risks of this for RTL Group are decreasing audience and
advertising market shares of its advertising-financed channels
with possible negative effects on TV advertising revenues.
To counter these risks, RTL Group is continuously revising
and developing the channel and program strategies. By
establishing leading positions locally in the streaming market,
in some cases with strategic partners, RTL Group counters
risks stemming from the growing use of non-linear services.
Increasing competition in the area of program acquisition and
TV production, and the growing dependence on individual
production companies, coupled with the risk of potential cost
increases, could also impact RTL Group's ability to generate
revenues. This risk is being reduced by expanding the share
of in-house productions in the program — in particular of local
content. To reduce the risk of customer losses, advertising
packages with cooperation partners are offered, as well as
pursuing the basic aim of establishing long-term customer
relationships.

The possibility of shifting business models and market
conditions significant Penguin
Random House. Due to the changing retail landscape,

constitute risks for
another risk is declining sales volumes in brick-and-mortar
book retail. Penguin Random House is addressing these risks
by supporting brick-and-mortar retailing, increasing online
sales of physical books and audiobooks, and continuously
examining alternative selling and marketing options. Any risks
of bad debt loss are being limited through debtor management,
and in some cases through credit insurance. In the area of
procurement and supply chains, rising costs for raw materials
and energy, and operational challenges at commissioned
printers also represent risks. These risks are countered through
ongoing cost management and by continually prioritizing and
securing additional printing capacities. In addition to the risk


--- Page 32 ---

of cost increases, Penguin Random House is finding itself
exposed to general economic risks that could lead to lower
sales. The risks are addressed through careful management of
supplier relationships and innovative marketing activities, and
by maintaining a flexible cost structure that allows for a quick
response in the event of an economic downturn.

Risks that affect BMG concern the client portfolio, in particular
contract extensions with artists and authors as well as
contractual relationships with business partners concerning
digital and physical distribution as well as film, TV, advertising
and live concerts. There are also risks resulting from corporate
growth, especially for business integration and scaling
of the technical platform and organization. Market risks,
especially changes in the market environment with increased
competitive pressures, are addressed through high revenue
diversification resulting from a fragmented client and catalog
base, both in regional and segment terms. Furthermore,
measures for minimizing risk include contractual protection
clauses to secure advance payments made, the realization of
prepayments received and minimum revenue guarantees.

Arvato sees itself as particularly exposed to risks from
customer and supplier relationships. The risk of loss of key
customers is being countered through contracts offering
comprehensive service packages with simultaneously flexible
cost structures. On the supplier side, there are risks associated
with the availability of services. Countermeasures include
an active exchange with existing suppliers and entering into
long-term framework agreements. New competitors entering
the market could intensify the competitive pressure and lead
to lower margins. By developing the range of services, the aim
is to improve the competitive position and increase customer
loyalty through integrated solutions. Moreover, new legislation
could have a negative impact on business models. This
risk is mitigated by observing legislative developments and
adjusting business processes. A worsening of the economic
environment could result in declining revenues and thus lower
margins, which would necessitate cost-cutting measures and
capacity downsizing. Broad diversification across regions and
sectors helps to reduce this risk.

For Bertelsmann Printing Group, the most significant risks
are possible further capacity adjustments, made necessary
by a deterioration in market development and existing or
growing overcapacities in the print market. Other significant
risks on the supplier side include the growing shortage of
raw materials caused by supply bottlenecks as well as
rising prices for raw materials, especially paper and energy.

The loss of customers also represents an additional risk.
In addition, price and margin pressures result from the
market environment, which is characterized by overcapacity.
Furthermore, deterioration in the economic environment
may also lead to declining circulations or even product
discontinuation. Digital substitution was given a lasting
boost by the coronavirus pandemic, and this constitutes
another factor in the decline in circulations and the number
of pages per issue, in particular in the magazine and catalog
print segments. Risk minimization strategies are based, in
particular, on the expansion of innovative print and marketing
services, ongoing initiatives to sign up large customers and
constantly optimizing cost structures and processes. Rising
factor costs are to be gradually offset by higher prices for
printing services.

For Bertelsmann Education Group, increasing competition
from existing training providers and the possible market
entry of new providers, particularly in the US healthcare
market, could lead to growing price and margin pressure
and to reduced new customer acquisition, and negatively
impact the planned growth targets. These risks are being
countered in particular through strategic partnerships, long-
term customer agreements, targeted customer retention
measures and an expansion of the product portfolio.

The key risks for Bertelsmann Investments consist of
falling portfolio valuations and a lack of exit opportunities.
These risks are being addressed through a standardized
investment process and the continuous monitoring of
investments.

The increasing pace of change in the markets, accelerated
even more by the coronavirus pandemic, and in Bertelsmann’s
business segments means employees will need to be
more willing and able to adapt in the future. There are also
continuing demographic risks that impact the recruitment,
development and retention of talent as a result of shifts in
the age distribution of the workforce. The pandemic has also
resulted in a skills shortage in many operational business
areas, and suitable measures, in particular customized
training opportunities, comprehensive health programs,
competitive remuneration and flexible working models, are
required to counteract this shortage. Bertelsmann is also
enhancing its talent management by digitalizing recruiting
processes and measures, and making it easier for employees
to switch jobs within the Group by harmonizing processes
and structures.

Acquisition-Related Risks

The Group strategy focuses on acquisitions of businesses as
well as organic growth. The risk of potential mistakes when
selecting investments and allocating investment funds is
limited by means of strict investment criteria and processes.
Acquisitions present both opportunities and risks. For example,
integration into the Group requires one-time costs that are
usually offset by increased benefits in the long term, thanks
to synergy effects. The risks here are that the integration
costs may be higher than expected or the predicted level of
synergies may not materialize. The integration processes are
therefore being monitored by management on an ongoing
basis.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

Bertelsmann, with its worldwide operations, is exposed to a
variety of legal and regulatory risks concerning, for example,
litigation or varying interpretations of tax assessment criteria.
Bertelsmann has television and radio operations in several
European countries that are subject to regulation. In
Germany, for example, the media is subject to oversight by
the Commission on Concentration in the Media. Moreover,
education activities are subject to regulatory provisions of
government authorities and accreditation bodies. Some of the
financial services activities are subject to banking supervision
regulations. Bertelsmann Group companies occupy leading
market positions in many lines of business, and may there-
fore have limited potential for growth through acquisition due
to antitrust legislation. Other risks include litigation relating
to company acquisitions and disposals, as well as increased
data protection regulations leading to growing challenges,
especially for data-based business models. These risks are
being continuously monitored by the relevant divisions within
the Group.

Several subsidiaries of RTL Group are being sued by the
broadcaster RTL 2 Fernsehen GmbH & Co KG and its sales
house El Cartel Media GmbH & Co KG before the regional
court in Dusseldorf, Germany, seeking disclosure of infor-
mation to substantiate a possible claim for damages. The
proceedings follow the imposition of a fine in 2007 by the
German Federal Cartel Office for abuse of market dominance
with regard to discount scheme agreements (share deals)
granted by AD Alliance GmbH (former IP Deutschland GmbH)
and SevenOne Media GmbH to media agencies. The German
Federal Cartel Office argued that these discounts would
foreclose small broadcasters from the advertising market.

36 Financial Information Combined Management Report

In 2014, the district court of Dusseldorf decided to order an
expert report. The expert concluded in February 2018 that
the likelihood of damages cannot be proven with certainty.
In July 2018, RTL 2 Fernsehen GmbH & Co KG filed a motion
claiming that the expert was not impartial, with the aim
of getting the court to obtain a new expert opinion.
AD Alliance GmbH has rejected the motion of lack of impartiality
as unfounded. In May 2019, the court announced it would
give the expert the opportunity to comment on the motion of
lack of impartiality. Because the expert died in February 2020,
an expert opinion was not submitted. The court stated that it
would appoint a new expert. It is expected that the process
of appointing a new expert and the preparation of the expert
opinion will take two to three years. It could ultimately take 15
to 20 years after filing (2008) for a final judgment to be handed
down. The court case will continue. Similar proceedings from
other small broadcasters, initiated in different courts, were
unsuccessful or have been withdrawn.

In June 2016, the main competitors of Fun Radio alleged that
the radio station influenced in its favor a survey conducted by
the Médiamétrie Institute to determine audience market share.
It was claimed that a host on the morning show encouraged
his listeners to vote for Fun Radio in this survey. In response to
these allegations, Médiamétrie decided to remove Fun Radio
from its surveys. Following a legal procedure initiated by Fun
Radio, Médiamétrie was required to reinstate Fun Radio in the
audience results surveys as of September 2016. Nevertheless,
Médiamétrie decided to lower Fun Radio's audience results in
its published surveys, alleging the existence of a “halo effect.”
Following a procedure initiated by Fun Radio, a judicial expert
was appointed in December 2017 to examine Médiamétrie’s
assessment of the alleged halo effect. In September 2019,
the judicial expert issued his final report, which confirmed
the halo effect but assessed that Fun Radio's results were
overcorrected. As of September 2017, Médiamétrie has again
published the full audience results for Fun Radio. In parallel
to the above procedure, in December 2016, the main com-
petitors of Fun Radio also filed a claim for damages, claiming
unfair competition, but this procedure was suspended until
the expert report was presented, and was restarted in the first
quarter of 2020. In the meantime, four of the six claimants
withdrew their claim from the proceedings. Negotiations on
a settlement with the two remaining claimants failed in late
July 2020. For this reason, the court case will continue.

On February 22, 2018, the Spanish Competition Authority
(CNMC) communicated to Atresmedia the opening of a
proceeding for sanctions in relation to possible practices

restricting competition prohibited by article 1 of the Spanish
Competition Act. On February 6, 2019, the CNMC notified
the Statement of Objections in which it assumes proven that
specific commercial practices by Atresmedia are restrictive of
competition. On May 28, 2019, the department of the com-
petition authority responsible for the investigation submitted
a proposal for a decision that included a proposed fine of
€49.2 million. Atresmedia submitted its observations on the
proposed decision on June 28, 2019. On November 12, 2019,
the CNMC Board announced its decision and imposed a fine
of €38.2 million. On January 10, 2020, Atresmedia filed an
application for judicial review against the decision with the
competent court. On October 21, 2020, the court entered a
judgment regarding the appeal filed by Atresmedia against the
CNMC on November 12, 2019. The court accepted the appeal
filed by Atresmedia for temporary suspension of payment of
fines, subject to security to be paid within two months. The
court denied the petition filed by Atresmedia requesting that it
be released from the obligation of complying with the CNMC
order. The order requests discontinuation of certain business
practices. The court argued that compliance with the order
was in the public interest and served to restore competition
in this sector. Atresmedia is researching with external legal
advisors whether it should appeal against the court's judg-
ment on the CNMC order. The prospects of success are per-
ceived to be very slim. Furthermore, the Spanish association
Forta is assessing whether it should also file for damages due
to lost profit as a result of the sales practices of Atresmedia
and Mediaset Espana. Atresmedia remains convinced that
the decision made by the CNMC is not sufficiently justified
and expects a positive outcome. The prospects of success are
based, inter alia, on the outdated definition of the advertising
market used by the CNMC.

In November 2020, Penguin Random House announced the
acquisition of the book publisher Simon & Schuster from the
media company Paramount Global (formerly ViacomCBS).
The transaction is subject to the approval of the antitrust
authorities. In the event that the acquisition is completely
prohibited or if the termination date is reached, Penguin
Random House has contractually agreed to payment of a
regulatory termination fee of US$200 million to Paramount
Global. On November 2, 2021, the Department of Justice
filed a suit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia
in Washington DC to block the transaction, citing concerns
about monopsony relating to the acquisition of author rights.
Bertelsmann has hired experienced litigation attorneys and
argues that the Department of Justice’s reasons for blocking
the deal are unfounded.

The year 2021 demonstrated how quickly the investment envi-
ronment in China can change. This became apparent from the
more consistent enforcement of antitrust and data protection
regulations, especially with regard to the tech giants. At the
same time, the Chinese government is tackling what it sees as
undesirable social developments by implementing regulatory
interventions, e.g., in the areas of education and fintech. This is
influencing the focus of BAI’s investment activities, the growth
expectations of the businesses and possible exit channels with
regard to the existing portfolio. Possible exit timings may gener-
ally be pushed back. Foreign direct investments in the People’s
Republic of China are also subject to regulatory restrictions.
To satisfy local requirements, some of Bertelsmann’s activities
in China are held by trustees (“variable interest entities” (VIE)).
These are standard market practice for investments in China
and are only rarely subject to judicial disputes. However,
there is a certain risk that it will not be possible to safeguard
VIE structures through the courts, particularly if the People’s
Republic changes its policies or if courts and authorities
change their case law or administrative practice toward invest-
ments by foreigners (particularly in respect to VIE structures).
The latest press releases point to a more restrictive policy, in
particular in data-intensive business areas. Tensions between
the United States and China could also have an adverse effect
on BAI's portfolio of listed companies and on the exit channel
of the US IPO. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable
Act (HFCAA) came into effect on December 18, 2020. The Act
directs the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
to prohibit the trading of shares in companies on US stock
exchanges if these companies’ annual financial statements
have, for three successive years, not been audited by auditing
firms who are themselves subject to oversight by the US Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The HFCAA
also requires non-US issuers whose auditors are not subject
to inspection by the PCAOB to disclose ownership and control
by non-US governmental entities, and to identify Chinese
Communist Party officials on their boards of directors. Because
the HFCAA allows for a period of three years for a delisting, the
Chinese issuers have to develop an action plan by no later than
2024 if no compromise is reached between the United States
and China in the meantime. Bertelsmann lawyers and external
legal counsel are working closely with the Group legal depart-
ment to follow further developments in order to anticipate legal
and economic consequences early on. This affects companies
within BMG, Arvato and most investments by BAI.

Aside from the matters outlined above, no further significant
legal and regulatory risks to Bertelsmann are apparent at this
time.

Information Security Risks

The ability to provide information in a timely, complete and
confidential way, and to process it without disruptions, is
crucial to Bertelsmann's success, and it continues to grow
is addressing the operating
environment, which is made tougher by cyber threats, at the

in importance. Bertelsmann

management level by operating a Group-wide Information
Security Management System (ISMS, based on ISO 27001).
The ISMS's goal is the structured management of cyber risks
and the monitoring of compliance with minimum Group
standards. In order to have access to cutting-edge cyber
in regular
operations and emergencies, Bertelsmann — in addition to

security technologies and specialist expertise

providing and further developing its own resources — also
uses a network of external partners, and is an active member
of the German Cyber Security Organization (Deutsche Cyber-
Sicherheitsorganisation: DCSO). Furthermore, Bertelsmann
addresses the increased risk with specific measures that directly
increase resilience in cyber security — for example, by supporting
the activities of Security Operations Centers and authentication
technologies. An indicative assessment of information security
risks was conducted in the 2021 financial year on the basis of
the method used to assess operative Group risks. The results
indicate that information security risks are moderate, analogous
to the categorization of major Group risks.

Financial Market Risks

As_an_ international corporation, Bertelsmann is exposed
to various forms of financial market risk, especially interest
rate and currency risks. These risks are primarily monitored
centrally by the Finance Department on the basis of guidelines
set up by the Executive Board. Derivative financial instruments
are used solely for hedging purposes. Currency derivatives are
primarily used to hedge future obligations that are subject to a
foreign currency risk. Some firm commitments denominated
in foreign currency are partially hedged when they are made,
with the hedged amount being adapted over time. A number
of subsidiaries are based outside the eurozone. The resulting
translation risk to the leverage factor (ratio of economic debt
to operating EBITDA) is managed by aligning the leverage
factors for the main currencies USD and GBP in the long term
with the maximum permitted for the Group. Foreign currency
translation risks arising from net investments in foreign
entities are not hedged. The cash flow risk from interest
rate changes is centrally monitored and controlled as part of
interest rate management. The aim is to achieve a balanced
ratio of different fixed-interest rates through the selection of

38 Financial Information Combined Management Report

appropriate maturity periods for the originated financial assets
and liabilities affecting liquidity, and through the ongoing
use of interest rate derivatives. The liquidity risk is regularly
monitored on the basis of the budget planning. The syndicated
loan and appropriate liquidity provisions form a sufficient risk
buffer for unplanned payments. Counterparty risks exist in
the Group in respect to invested cash and cash equivalents,
as well as in case a counterparty to derivative transactions
defaults. Transactions involving money market securities and
other financial instruments are exclusively conducted with a
defined group of banks with high credit ratings. Within the
guidelines, a risk limit specified by the Executive Board has
been issued for financial assets and derivatives for each
counterparty. Compliance with this limit is regularly monitored
by the Finance Department. The guidelines concerning the
investment of cash and cash equivalents are continuously
monitored and extended if necessary. Financial investments
are made ona short-term basis, so that the investment volume
can be reduced if the credit rating changes. Financial market
risks remain at a moderate level. The setup of a strategic and
anticipatory liquidity reserve in the wake of the coronavirus
pandemic creates increased interest rate risks related to
investing the liquidity.

General Statement on the Risk Situation

The risks identified in the 2021 financial year are not
endangering. Neither are there any substantial discernible
risks that could threaten the existence of the Group.

The overall risk situation is slightly above the previous year's
level. Due to continuing uncertainty regarding the impact
of further developments in the pandemic and of increased
inflation, risks arising from economic development continue
to represent the main challenge. Legal and regulatory risks,
risks arising from a changing market environment, supplier
and customer risks, the possible loss of audience and market
share at RTL Group, and pricing and margin risks constitute
other key challenges. However, as a result of the diversification
of Group businesses, there are no concentration risks
stemming from dependency on individual business partners
or products in either procurement or sales. The Group's
financial position is solid, with liquidity needs covered by
existing liquidity and available credit facilities.

Opportunity Management System

An efficient opportunity management system enables
Bertelsmann to secure its corporate success in the long term,


--- Page 36 ---

and to exploit potential in an optimal way. Opportunities are
possible future developments or events that could result
in a positive deviation from the outlook or objectives for
Bertelsmann. The opportunity management system is, like
the RMS, an integral component of business processes
and company decisions. During the strategy and planning
process, significant opportunities are determined each year
from the profit-center level upward, and then aggregated step
by step at the division and Group levels. By systematically
recording them on several reporting levels, opportunities that
arise can be identified and exploited at an early stage. This also
creates an interdivisional overview of Bertelsmann’s current
opportunities. A review of major changes in opportunities is
conducted at the division level every six months. In addition,
the largely decentralized opportunity management system is
coordinated by central departments in the Group in order to
derive synergies through targeted cooperation in the individual
divisions. The interdivisional experience transfer is reinforced
by regular meetings of the GMC.

Opportunities

While the above-mentioned opportunities associated with
positive development may be accompanied by corresponding
risks, certain risks are entered into in order to be able to
exploit potential opportunities. This link to the key Group risks
offers strategic, operational, legal, regulatory and financial
opportunities for Bertelsmann.

Strategic opportunities can be derived primarily from the
Group's further strategic development (see the section
“Strategy”). In particular, there are opportunities in some cases
for exploiting synergies as a result of the strategic portfolio
expansions. There are individual operating opportunities in
the individual divisions, in addition to the possibility of more
favorable economic development.

For RTL Group, a better-than-expected development of the
advertising and streaming markets, as well as higher audience
and advertising market shares, are major opportunities. The
increasing digitalization and fragmentation of the media
landscape are opening up opportunities. Professionally pro-
duced content can be distributed across multiple platforms
nationally and internationally. New revenue streams could be
generated by exploiting existing TV content across different
platforms, and by creating native digital content. Also, the
increased presence in the digital sector provides opportunities
for online video advertising sales on all devices and platforms,
and growing subscriber-based revenues in the on-demand

business. Other opportunities can be found in target-group
marketing of the Group's own inventory (addressable
advertising) and advertising technology products for third
parties. In addition, more widespread use of new technologies
such as UHD/4K could lead to greater revenue growth in the
distribution business.

For the trade publishing group Penguin Random House,
opportunities lie in signing new authors and new book
projects. The publishing group is well positioned to invest
in new markets and content around the world, and to offer
its products to the widest possible readership. In general,
the digital evolution transforming book markets offers the
potential for new product development, and broader and more
efficient marketing channels as well as better accessibility
to the backlist. Digital audiobooks are experiencing growth
worldwide, while new technologies could make books more
appealing and bring book content to wider audiences. New
online tools and platforms are expanding opportunities for
author engagement with readers.

BMG's focus is on growth through signing new contracts
with artists and authors, especially the acquisition of music
rights and the monetization thereof. Furthermore, the
growing international market penetration of subscription-
based streaming services offers opportunities to expand the
recorded-music and music-publishing markets as well as a
significantly expanded monetization basis, e.g., in the areas of
gaming, fitness and self-help apps.

At Arvato, strategic partnerships and major projects can
provide additional opportunities for acquiring new customers.
The global e-commerce market is expected to continue
its dynamic growth over the next few years. Arvato could
participate in this growth through further business expansion,
particularly with Majorel, Supply Chain Solutions and Financial
Solutions. Further growth opportunities from ongoing
digitalization lie in the development of innovative IP-based
and multi-cloud-based IT services.

Bertelsmann Printing Group businesses may decline less
steeply through additional
new customers. Furthermore,
the market could result in an additional strengthening of
Bertelsmann Printing Group’s own competitive position.

volumes from existing and
increased consolidation in

In particular, a further shift from traditional classroom-based
delivery methods toward online and skill-based training offers
further growth opportunities for the education business.

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2021 39


--- Page 37 ---

The growing skills shortage in the fields of healthcare,
technology and education also offers opportunities for organic
growth for Bertelsmann Education Group. For example, Relias
in the United States has the potential to grow more rapidly
than expected through additional offerings for hospitals in the
area of recruiting and workforce management.

For Bertelsmann Investments fund activities, there is the
opportunity to realize higher-than-expected profits thanks
to increasing portfolio valuations or through the disposal of
investments.
The current innovation efforts detailed in the section
“Innovations” offer further potential opportunities for the
individual divisions.

Other opportunities could arise from changes to the legal and
regulatory environment.

The financial opportunities are largely based on a favorable
development of interest and exchange rates from
Bertelsmann’s point of view.

Outlook

Anticipated Overall Economic Development

Bertelsmann anticipates that economic conditions will
develop as follows in 2022. The coronavirus pandemic and
supply chain bottlenecks will determine the development
of the global economy over the forecast period. Despite
the momentum of the global economic upturn, there are
still significant risks in 2022. A slower-than-expected rise in
vaccination rates and the spread of virus mutations could
lead to further outbreaks around the world. Any containment
measures introduced by countries in response would slow
growth. In its outlook from December 2021, the Institute
for the World Economy (IfWV) in Kiel estimates that global
production will increase by 4.5 percent in 2022, compared
to a rise of 5.9 percent in 2021. The above stated eco-
nomic expectations for the year 2022 are based on a stable
geopolitical environment.

The economic recovery in the eurozone is expected to
progress further. The IfW estimates real economic growth
of 3.5 percent in 2022. The IfW expects Germany's GDP
to grow by 4.0 percent in real terms. The growth rate in
France is expected to be 2.9 percent in real terms. For the

40 Financial Information Combined Management Report

United Kingdom, GDP is expected to rise by 4.5 percent in
real terms in 2022. Positive growth rates are also expected
once again in the United States. The forecast for 2022 is real
economic growth of 4.4 percent.

The current geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe could slow
down the global economic recovery and negatively affect the
business performance of Bertelsmann.

Anticipated Development in Relevant Markets

The worldwide media industry is primarily influenced by
global economic developments and the resulting growth
dynamic. The continued trend toward digitalization of content
and distribution channels, changes in media usage and the
increasing influence of emerging economies will continue to
present risks and opportunities in the years to come. With
its strategic focus, Bertelsmann expects to benefit to an
increasing extent from the resulting opportunities. Through
its businesses, Bertelsmann operates in a variety of different
markets and regions whose developments are subject to a
range of factors and that do not respond in a linear fashion to
overall economic tendencies. The following takes into account
only those markets and regions that are large enough to be
relevant for forecasting purposes and whose expected
development can be appropriately aggregated and evaluated,
or that are strategically important from a Group perspective.

In 2022, the TV advertising markets in Germany and France
are expected to be stable, while significant growth is
expected in Hungary and a slight decline in the Netherlands.
The streaming markets in Germany and the Netherlands are
expected to continue growing strongly. The book markets
are expected to remain stable overall. In the relevant music
market, the publishing market segment is expected to
grow strongly, while significant growth is projected for
the recordings market segment. The services markets are
predicted to show significant growth in 2022. The European
printing markets are expected to record a moderate (offset)
to strong (gravure) decline, while the book printing market in
North America is expected to remain stable. Overall, sustained
moderate to strong growth is anticipated for the relevant US
education markets.

Expected Business Development
The following assessments are subject to a particularly high

degree of uncertainty. It is not possible to predict the direction
of the pandemic and of the geopolitical tensions in Eastern


--- Page 38 ---

Europe and their economic consequences, therefore making
it hard to sufficiently predict the future. This unpredictability is
currently a challenge when trying to assess the effects on the
markets relevant to Bertelsmann and the anticipated overall
economic situation. In addition, geopolitical crises, national
deficits, currency turbulence or the introduction of higher tariffs
as a result of rising protectionist tendencies could interfere
with economic performance. The resulting developments
could also adversely affect the overall economic situation,
which is a key factor influencing Bertelsmann’s business
performance. Accordingly, the following expectations are
based on the assumption of a continued recovery in the overall
economic situation, and an assumption that most of the
forecasted market developments and economic predictions
of the research institutions will be realized.

For the financial year 2022, Bertelsmann anticipates that
business development will be driven by a further normalization
of the European TV advertising markets and by stable book
markets, as well as by growing service, music and online
education markets. The growth stimuli created through
strategic portfolio expansions will continue to have a positive
impact on Bertelsmann’s growth profile.

In addition to the assumed market developments, the pre-
dicted economic developments in the geographic core
markets of Western Europe and the United States are the
basis of the expected business development. With revenue
and earnings share within the eurozone currently expected
at around two-thirds, the range of growth is above all based
on the forecasted economic development in this economic
zone. The IfW therefore predicts that GDP in the eurozone will
increase by 3.5 percent in real terms, while the International
Monetary Fund expects growth of 3.9 percent for 2022. In
view of these economic expectations and assuming that infec-
tion rates do not rise again, Bertelsmann expects revenues to
show a moderate increase in the financial year 2022. In view
of start-up losses regarding the expansion of the streaming
business at RTL Group, the operating EBITDA is forecast to
decline moderately in the financial year 2022. Without these
start-up losses, a stable development is expected. BVA is
expected to drop sharply but to be clearly positive once again
in the financial year 2022, due to the start-up losses
mentioned above. These expectations are based on
operational planning for the financial year 2022 and on the
exchange rates as of November 2021.

RTL Group revenues will grow, among other factors, after
taking over Gruner + Jahr’s publishing activities, and are

expected to strongly increase compared to the previous
year. Otherwise, the expected performance of any individual
division of key significance for the Bertelsmann Group is not
expected to deviate significantly from that of the Group.

Depending on how the economy develops, Bertelsmann does
not currently anticipate interest rate changes to have any
material impact on the average financing costs of medium-
to long-term financing. The liquidity situation in the forecast
period is expected to be sufficient.

These forecasts are based on Bertelsmann’s business
strategy, as outlined in the section “Corporate Profile.” As of
January 1, 2022, Gruner + Jahr is no longer reported as
an independent division. The publishing activities will be
part of the RTL Group division in the future. The remaining
Gruner + Jahr activities will be assigned to the Bertelsmann
Investments division in the future. In general, the forecasts
reflect careful consideration of risks and opportunities.
All statements concerning potential future economic and
business developments represent opinions advanced on the
basis of the information that is currently available. Should
underlying assumptions fail to apply and/or further risks arise,
actual results may differ from those expected. Accordingly, no
assurances can be provided concerning the accuracy of such
statements.

as the definition and further development of group strategy,
capital allocation, financing and management. There are also
service functions for individual divisions within the Corporate
Center. Furthermore, it is the controlling company of the tax
group for most of the domestic subsidiaries. The position of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is essentially determined by the
business success of the Bertelsmann Group.

Results of Operations of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA

The results of operations of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA are
significantly affected by the amount of income from other
participations, due to Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA’s role as
the parent company of the Bertelsmann Group. The decrease
in net income to €356 million (previous year: €435 million) is
primarily attributable to the drop in other operating income
and in income from participations. In contrast to this, the
reduction in taxes on income had a positive impact on the
development in net income.

The decrease in other operating income is attributable to the
proceeds from the disposal of a plot of land and a building in
the previous year as well as the reduction in foreign currency
gains. This development was partly offset by the rise in
reversals of write-downs of shares in affiliated companies
and by the reversals of loss allowances on receivables.
The €60 million in reversals in the reporting year relates to
shares in RM Hamburg Holding GmbH, Hamburg (formerly:
Gruner + Jahr GmbH, Hamburg) and results from the agreed

42 Financial Information Combined Management Report

sale of significant parts of the business and of the shares
held in subsidiaries to RTL Deutschland. The increase of
€16 million in other operating expenses is largely attributable
to an increase in currency losses and expenses arising from
guarantee agreements. This was offset by the reduction of
loss allowances on receivables.

Income from other participations is primarily affected by
the amount of income from a profit and loss transfer
agreement with Bertelsmann Capital Holding GmbH,
Gutersloh. As a result of the collection of dividends, the
amount of income coming from the profit and loss transfer
agreement with this company rose by €406 million. The
decrease in income coming from the profit and loss transfer
agreements of other subsidiaries exceeds this increase,
with the result that income from investments were
€174 million lower than in the previous year. The income
from investments was lower in the 2021 financial year as a
result of a restructuring subsidy paid to a subsidiary. In the
previous year, the income coming from the profit and loss
transfer agreements of other subsidiaries was influenced by
positive effects from a corporate transaction and sales of
buildings.

Taxes on income decreased in the financial year 2021 as a
result of the tax group's lower taxable income.

Net Assets and Financial Position of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA

The total assets of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA amounted to
€25,879 million, compared to €25,513 million in the previous
year. A high ratio of equity (40 percent) and long-term
financial assets (72 percent) to total assets continues to
characterize net assets and financial position.

The increase in long-term financial assets concerns investments
in affiliated companies (€706 million) and investment securities
(€242 million). Investments in affiliated companies increased
due to contributions to Bertelsmann Capital Holding GmbH,
GUtersloh, in the amount of €648 million, and the reversal
of impairments of shares in RM Hamburg Holding GmbH,
Hamburg (formerly: Gruner + Jahr GmbH, Hamburg). The
addition to investment securities relates to €100 million of
securities in a special fund serving as a liquidity investment.
The increase in receivables and other assets is largely related to
financing extended to affiliated companies. The €2,255 million
reduction in cash and cash equivalents is largely attributable to
measures taken in the liquidity portfolio. Funds amounting to
€1,029 million were invested in securities held as current assets.

Equity increased by €356 million as a result of the net income
of the reporting year, minus the dividend of €180 million paid
out for the financial year 2020. Bonds and obligations have
decreased by €1,028 million due to the repurchase of bonds
and the repayment of bonds and obligations. The increase
in liabilities to affiliated companies from €7,601 million to
€8,917 million is attrioutable to the increase in the amount of
cash and cash equivalents that were deposited by subsidiaries
with Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA.

Risks and Opportunities for Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA

As Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is largely linked to the
Bertelsmann Group companies, among other things through
financing and guarantee commitments, as well as through
direct and indirect investments in the subsidiaries, the situ-
ation of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA in terms of risks and
opportunities is primarily dependent on the risks and oppor-
tunities of the Bertelsmann Group. In this respect, the state-
ments made by corporate management concerning the overall
assessment of the risks and opportunities also constitute a
summary of the risks and opportunities of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA (see the section “Risks and Opportunities”).

As the parent company of the Bertelsmann Group,
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA receives from its subsidiaries
dividend distributions and income or expenses from profit
and loss transfer agreements, as well as income from services
provided to its subsidiaries. Consequently, the performance
of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is primarily determined by
the business performance of the Bertelsmann Group (see the
section “Outlook”). Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA expects its
results for the financial year 2022 to allow a dividend payment
at the same level as the dividend for the reporting period.

Dependent Company Report (Statement in accordance with
Section 312 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG))

The Executive Board of Bertelsmann Management SE, as gen-
eral partner of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA, has submitted a
voluntary report to the Supervisory Board of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA in accordance with sections 278 (3) and 312 (1) of
the German Stock Corporation Act, in which it outlines its rela-
tionships with affiliated companies for the financial year 2021.
The Executive Board hereby declares that Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA received adequate consideration in return for each
and every legal transaction under the circumstances known at
the time the transactions were undertaken.

Combined Non-Financial Statement

The following information relates to Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
and the Bertelsmann Group (“Bertelsmann”) with its incorpo-
rated, fully consolidated subsidiaries (“subsidiaries”) in accor-
dance with sections 315b and 315c of the HGB, in conjunction
with sections 289b to 289e of the HGB. Bertelsmann operates
in the core business fields of media, services and education
in around 50 countries (see the section “Corporate Profile”).
These are set forth in the corporate constitution as well as in
the Bertelsmann Essentials “Creativity & Entrepreneurship.” In
its corporate responsibility management, Bertelsmann pursues
the goal of reconciling commercial interests with social and
environmental concerns, within the Group and beyond.

When preparing its combined non-financial statement,
Bertelsmann follows the Standards (2016) of the Global
Reporting Initiative (102 and 103). In addition, voluntary reporting
based on the GRI Standards (2016, 2018; in accordance: Core
option) is published in the middle of the financial year.

Company Principles and Guidelines

The prerequisites for a corporate culture in which employees,
management and shareholders work together success-
fully, respectfully and in a spirit of trust are common
goals and shared values. These are set forth in the corporate
constitution as well as in the Bertelsmann Essentials “Creativity &
Entrepreneurship.” Furthermore, the Bertelsmann Code of
Conduct — as a binding guideline — defines minimum standards
for ethical and lawful conduct within the company and toward
business partners and the public. The Bertelsmann Supplier
Code of Conduct sets out the mandatory minimum requirements
for business partners in their relationship with Bertelsmann.

Bertelsmann’s actions are also determined by external guide-
lines. The company uses as guidance the recommendations
of the German Corporate Governance Code for good and
responsible corporate governance and largely follows the
OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Bertelsmann
is committed to the principles of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, the United Nations Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights, and the International Labor
Organization core labor standards. As a participant in the
United Nations Global Compact, Bertelsmann supports the
UN's Agenda 2030 for sustainable development.

Corporate Responsibility Management
Organization

The advisory body for the management and _ strategic
development of corporate responsibility (CR) at Bertelsmann
is the CR Council. The CR Council consists of executives from
the corporate divisions and the Chief Human Resources Officer
of Bertelsmann, who chairs the advisory body. The CR Council
focuses on the further development of group-wide CR priorities
in line with the corporate strategy, anchoring corporate respon-
sibility more strongly in the corporate divisions and the cross-
divisional coordination of CR activities within the Group.

At the Group level, the Corporate Responsibility department
coordinates and supports the work of the CR Council in
close cooperation with other Group functions. Within the
Bertelsmann corporate structure, the local management teams
are responsible for implementing corporate responsibility
through specific measures. The corporate divisions and
companies have their own structures and processes in place
for this, in accordance with local requirements.

Topics

To identify thematic CR priorities, Bertelsmann carries
out regular CR relevance analyses. For each analysis,
the company conducts a survey of external and internal
stakeholders as regards non-financial topics selected
in advance: the external stakeholders estimate the
impact of Bertelsmann’s business activity on the non-
financial topics, while the internal stakeholders assess
their business relevance. This process serves to identify
CR priorities that are necessary for understanding the
business development, the business performance, the
position of the Group and the impact of its activity on
employees, society and the environment. The CR priorities
are analyzed within the company boundaries, unless
otherwise stated. In 2021, the Bertelsmann Executive
Board adopted the new CR relevance matrix with eight
CR priorities (creative/editorial independence & freedom
of expression; content responsibility; fair working
conditions; diversity, equity & inclusion; health & well-
being; learning; responsibility in the supply chain;
and climate change). The Bertelsmann CR Program
(2021-2023) adopted on this basis includes individual
working programs for every CR priority. Their content and
relevance for the 2021 financial year is explained elsewhere
in this non-financial statement.

Non-financial topics, including their performance indicators,
are increasingly important for Bertelsmann’s businesses,
but have not yet been incorporated into the Group's
value-oriented management system (see the section “Value-
Oriented Management System”).

Risks

A number of risks are associated with the CR priorities
relevant for Bertelsmann. These risks can arise from the
company’s own business activities or from its business
relationships, and can affect the company or its environment
and stakeholders.

For the non-financial matters defined in the German
Commercial Code — employee and social matters, respect
for human rights, anti-corruption and bribery matters, and
environmental matters — no significant risks that were very
likely to have serious negative effects, either individually or
collectively, were identifiable as part of the 2021 reporting.
For more information on the relevant risks, please see the
section “Risks and Opportunities.”

Employee Matters

Motivated employees are the most important resource for
Bertelsmann’s success, and they are essential for creativity
and entrepreneurship. This corporate identity — anchored in
the corporate constitution and the Bertelsmann Essentials —
is the basis for the Executive Board guidelines on HR work.
Supplementary regulations are specified in the Bertelsmann
Code of Conduct. The Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO)
of Bertelsmann is responsible for employee matters. The main
focus of his work throughout the Group includes setting
the strategic HR agenda, aligning management and talent
development with the Group's strategic growth priorities,
the re- and upskilling activities of Bertelsmann University in
the tech & data field, standardizing and providing IT support
for HR processes, and continually developing corporate
responsibility and the corporate culture.

The CHRO heads the HR Committee, which is the corporate
committee responsible for international HR matters at
Bertelsmann. Its members are the heads of HR at the
corporate divisions, who report to the CHRO, as well as
head managers of the corporate HR department.

Fair Working Conditions

Strategy implementation and operational responsibility are for
the most part delegated to the divisions and companies, in
accordance with the subsidiarity principle. With that in mind,
Bertelsmann sees it as its responsibility to ensure fair working
conditions and a safe and healthy working environment for
employees. The Supplier Code of Conduct contains standards
for Bertelsmann’s business partners stipulating that they
adhere to the statutory regulations on fair working conditions
and provide a framework that allows their employees to speak
up freely and without fear of retaliation.

At Bertelsmann, remuneration issues are an integral part
of fair working conditions. The compensation system is
designed to ensure that remuneration is driven by market,
function and performance considerations, taking into account
business-specific characteristics. Numerous domestic and
foreign subsidiaries have operational/divisional success and
profit-sharing models adapted to local requirements. In 2021,
a total of €88 million was distributed as part of such participa-
tion schemes globally.

Continual dialogue between employees and company
management at Bertelsmann represents another key

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2021 45


--- Page 43 ---

element for fair working conditions. Employees are involved
in the development and improvement of working conditions
through standardized HR interview tools (performance and
development dialogue, agreements on objectives, team
talk), as well as international employee surveys. Although
Bertelsmann, as a media company, is free to determine
its political direction as defined in the German “Works
Constitutions Act” (Tendenzschutz) and therefore is not
subject to statutory co-determination in the Supervisory
Board, the company nevertheless makes four positions
on the Supervisory Board of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
available to employees on a voluntary basis. Three of
these are leading works council members of German
Group companies. Since June 1, 2021, Nuria Cabuti, CEO
of Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial, has been a
member of the Supervisory Board in her capacity as Chair of
the international Bertelsmann Management Representative
Committee. In addition, managers, general workforce,
employees with disabilities and trainees all have platforms
for exchanging ideas, advancing topics and voicing their
concerns. The Bertelsmann Group Dialogue Conference is an
event where the CEO, CHRO and members of the Corporate
Works Council from the Group divisions in Germany can
exchange ideas.

Other elements of the topic “Fair Working Conditions” — such
as respecting human rights, including antidiscrimination;
diversity, equity & inclusion; health & well-being (including
protecting the health of employees in the continuing
coronavirus pandemic); and learning — are discussed
elsewhere in this non-financial statement.

In 2021, the company defined strategic objectives relating
to fair working conditions, and developed measures from
those, as part of the Bertelsmann CR Program (2021-2023).
These include the further development of a Group-wide
management approach to fair working conditions and
respecting human rights, the continuous advancement of
knowledge on these topics and the further development
of processes for identifying risks concerning human rights
issues.

Among. the important were the
communication of the revised Bertelsmann Code of
Conduct and the international employee survey, which was
conducted according to schedule. Driven by the coronavirus
crisis, flexible working models acquired greater importance. As
a result, Bertelsmann developed and communicated a Group-
wide stance on new work, and put in place a cross-divisional
exchange format.

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)

Diversity and differences in the workforce are prerequisites
for creativity, innovation and Bertelsmann’s long-term
business success. This conviction is conveyed
Bertelsmann Essentials and in the new DEI policy. In that
policy, the Bertelsmann Executive Board emphasizes its aim
of further increasing diversity of staff at all levels and in every
respect, and of creating general conditions that foster a sense
of appreciation, belonging and inclusion among employees.

in the

The DEI strategy and the working program developed within
the Bertelsmann CR Program (2021-2023) are implemented
by the Corporate Responsibility department with support from
a Group-wide working group and from other working groups
in the corporate divisions. The focus in 2021 was on the
following dimensions: gender, disabilities, and sexual orienta-
tion and identity. Some divisions also set their own additional
priorities.

On December 31, 2021, the genders were almost evenly
distributed across the entire staff (54 percent women,
previous year: 54 percent; 46 percent men, previous year:
46 percent). The Group Management Committee was com-
prised of 18 members (previous year: 18), of which five were
women (previous year: six). Two additional female execu-
tives will be appointed to the Group Management Committee
effective March 1, 2022. Bertelsmann had also set itself the
target of raising the ratio of women in top and senior manage-
ment across all corporate divisions to one-third by the end
of 2021. While the proportion of female executives in senior
management was unchanged from the previous year,
Bertelsmann did further increase the ratio in top manage-
ment. That figure is now 30 percent in both target groups (see
table below). Furthermore, the targeted proportion of women
in the talent pools was set at one-third for the top and senior
management pool and 50 percent for the career development
pool. These target figures were met in all three pool cohorts
in 2021. The Supervisory Board and the Executive Board are
notified annually of progress in regard to these targets.

In 2021, the company defined strategic objectives relating
to DEI as part of the Bertelsmann CR Program (2021-2023).
These include the greater involvement of the Executive Board
and top management into DEI engagement, the strategic
further development of Diversity Management into Diversity,
Equity & Inclusion Management, the professionalization of
the governance structures for DEI in the corporate divisions,
and awareness raising and competence development in
relation to DEI.

The Bertelsmann Executive Board’s new DEI policy was
communicated in this context. In addition, a number of anti-
racism measures have been implemented in the company.
These included Group-wide training sessions and awareness-
raising communication. The Bertelsmann Action Plan for
Inclusion 2019-2024 aims to improve participation for
employees with disabilities in the German Bertelsmann
companies. The second annual evaluation can be viewed on
the Bertelsmann website: www.bertelsmann.com/disability-
and-inclusion. Furthermore, the first-ever Group Inclusion
Agreement, covering all Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA opera-
tions and group companies in Germany, was concluded.
The LGBTIO+ employee network “be.queer” has advanced
international collaboration with the LGBITQ+ networks in the
corporate divisions. For example, Pride Month was marked
with Group-wide activities. The Bertelsmann website provides
an overview of the DEI measures at Bertelsmann and in the
corporate divisions at www.bertelsmann.com/diversity.

Health & Well-being

Bertelsmann aims to create a health-promoting working
environment and conditions for avoiding occupational health
risks.

In 2021, the topic “Health & Well-being” was confirmed as
a Group-wide CR priority, defined as a Group-wide focus
of the CHRO and further developed as part of the
Bertelsmann CR Program (2021-2023). The Corporate
Responsibility department is responsible for developing and
implementing the Group-wide Health & Well-being strategy.
Working with an international and cross-divisional working
group, the department defines the strategic framework for
health-related topics.

Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the focus in 2021
remained the immediate health protection of all employees
around the world. One focus of efforts to prevent infections
was vaccination against the coronavirus and the development
of the necessary infrastructure in the corporate divisions

(depending on the respective regional legal regulations).
All employees in Germany received a vaccination offer
via the regional company doctors. Vaccination centers
for employees and their families were also established
in the Gltersloh area and in Cologne. Further prevention
and protection measures, e.g., working from home and
the provision of masks, disinfectants and coronavirus test
kits, were continued in accordance with basic regulatory
conditions. All of these measures were accompanied by
numerous support programs for maintaining mental and
physical health as well as extensive internal communication
activities.

In addition to the strategic and organizational further
development of the Health & Well-being topic and the
management of the coronavirus crisis, two other relevant
areas were defined as part of the Bertelsmann CR Program
(2021-2023). These include the empowerment of executives
to create a healthy and safe working environment and
corporate culture; and the support of employees to adopt
healthy working habits and lifestyle, with measures also
being taken to enhance individual resilience.

On the level of measures, the focus in 2021 was initially on
strategic and organizational anchoring. In response to the
employee survey results pertaining to health, communication
materials were provided and workshops held with “Health
Working Groups” of the German corporate divisions.

Learning

Bertelsmann aims to empower employees at all levels to
adapt to the challenges of a quickly changing environ-
ment and to continuously learn from and with one another.
The topic of learning (“upskilling”) was highlighted as an
important enabler in Bertelsmann’s new strategy framework.
Furthermore, great importance is attached to an open learn-
ing culture that embraces experimentation as an element
of creativity in the Bertelsmann Essentials.

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2021 47


--- Page 45 ---

The Chief Learning Officer is responsible for the Group's
learning strategy, which is implemented by Bertelsmann
University and in Germany by the Bertelsmann vocational
college. The HR Committee regularly discusses and agrees on
aspects of this learning strategy, and supports its implementa-
tion in the corporate divisions. These aspects complement the
central focus areas for learning with individual training initia-
tives. Employees around the world are thereby given access
to central and division-specific training courses, and to more
than 15,000 freely accessible online courses by LinkedIn
Learning and almost 2,000 online courses by CreativeLive.

In 2021, the company defined strategic objectives relating
to this topic as part of the Bertelsmann CR Program
(2021-2023). These include developing a re- and upskilling
approach, empowering and networking managers to facilitate
the future-oriented design of the Bertelsmann transformation,
expanding the offerings on business-critical competencies
for all employees (e.g., tech & data) and promoting a learning
culture.

With regard to measures, a target-actual analysis of tech &
data roles was carried out in 2021 to identify qualification
gaps. In addition, the company launched the digital pro-
gram series “Be-Ready” for top executives with a focus on
“Strategy in the Transformation.” The three-year Udacity
technology scholarship program was continued for the
third year, providing 50,000 scholarships for which both
Bertelsmann employees and external candidates are
eligible to apply. A new tech & data offering was also added
to the Group-wide digital peer-to-peer learning format “Your
Campus.”

Social Matters
Creative /Editorial Independence & Freedom of Expression

Free and critical thinking as well as exchange of varying
opinions are prerequisites for creativity. Bertelsmann stands
for editorial and journalistic independence in its content
businesses, as well as for freedom of the press and artistic
license. The company publishes a wide variety of opinions
and positions. These basic principles for business activities are
therefore also set forth in the Bertelsmann Code of Conduct.
Bertelsmann aims to ensure this creative/editorial indepen-
dence in two directions. Inside the company, it means that our
management does not attempt to influence the decisions of
artists, authors, editors and program managers, or to restrict
their freedom. To the outside, this means that both content

48 Financial Information Combined Management Report

managers and company managers comply with existing laws
regarding the separation of editorial content and commercial
advertising and do not capitulate to political or economic
influence in their coverage. In accordance with the
Bertelsmann “Editor-in-Chief Principle,” editorial decisions

are the sole responsibility of the content managers.

In order to share ideas and best practices, a regular exchange
also takes place in a cross-divisional working group between
the representatives of the Bertelsmann corporate divisions
that produce content.

In 2021, the company defined strategic objectives relating to
this topic as part of the Bertelsmann CR Program (2021-2023).
These
continuously developing high-quality news reporting output

include guaranteeing the safety of journalists,

and creating an environment that supports creative/editorial
independence and that reflects a diversity of perspectives and
differences of people and their opinions, ideas and stories.

Measures derived from this and already implemented in 2021
include a “Violence against Journalists” checklist, which was
developed by RTL Deutschland. The list is intended to help
to minimize the risk of violence in the run-up to and during
filming, and to find the right contact person. Under the title
“JAhr zur Wahrheit. Weil's stimmen muss” (roughly: “Y[ear
of Yes to truth. Because it has to be true”), the companies in
the Bertelsmann Content Alliance are advocating journalistic
integrity, quality and responsibility, and campaigning against
conspiracy theories and the manipulation of minds, with a
cross-divisional marketing campaign on the radio, on TV and
in print.

In addition, a variety of organizational measures were
continued to safeguard editorial and artistic independence
in the editorial and creative departments. Here the focus is
primarily on complying with the “Editor-in-Chief Principle,”
such as duties of care and respect for privacy, and dealing with
the representation of violence and the protection of minors.

Content Responsibility

Content responsibility at Bertelsmann means reflecting on
the repercussions of content production and distribution, to
protect the rights and interests of media users, customers
and third parties as far as possible. Overriding principles
and guidelines of media ethics are set by national and inter-
national laws governing the press, broadcasting and multi-
media. These are underpinned by voluntary commitments to
external guidelines, such as the ethics codes of national press


--- Page 46 ---

councils, and within the company by the Bertelsmann Code of
Conduct. In accordance with these principles and guidelines,
Bertelsmann’s editorial staff are committed to, among other
things, “respecting privacy and the responsible treatment of
information, opinion and images.” As a result, the company
expects careful research, high-quality reporting and transpar-
ency in case of errors — because thorough journalistic work is
more important than ever in the face of online disinformation
(“fake news”). Cross-divisional verification teams provide their
expertise in discerning between authentic and manipulated
photos and videos, or those taken out of context.

Furthermore, the issue of content responsibility is anchored in
various ways in the divisions, companies and editorial depart-
ments. In accordance with the “Editor-in-Chief Principle,” the
responsibility for media content lies solely with the managers
in the editorial teams and creative departments.

In 2021, the company defined strategic objectives relating to
content responsibility as part of the Bertelsmann CR Program
(2021-2023). These include expanding coverage of socio-
political topics, ensuring complete youth media protection
in streaming services and digital provision, and developing
guidelines for publishing content.

On the level of measures, RTL launched its “Klima Update”
(“Climate Update”) program, which examines the topic in all its
various facets. Furthermore, the news channel “ntv” covered
the United Nations Climate Change Conference with a
series titled “Wie schaffen wir Klimawandel” (“How can we
manage climate change?”), with on-location reporting and an
extensive schedule of special programs. The Gruner + Jahr
magazine “Geo” is increasingly anchoring sustainability in its
core business and is adapting operations and work processes
accordingly. Among other topics, “Geo” covered all aspects of
climate and species protection, as well as future technologies,
in its “Nature and Sustainability” section, and it also launched
“Wer wird Visionar?” (“Who wants to be a visionary?”), a pod-
cast casting show searching for the best sustainable ideas
Germany has to offer. Under the umbrella of the Bertelsmann
Content Alliance and under the motto “Damit es auch morgen
noch lauft” (“Making sure things will still work tomorrow”),
RTL Deutschland, UFA, RTL Radio Deutschland, the Penguin
Random House publishing group and Gruner + Jahr put the
spotlight on water as a resource as part of the “Packen wir's
an” (“Let's get to grips with it”) themed week launched in
October 2021.

The company shoulders a special responsibility when
creating and distributing content for children and teenagers,

who experience their living environment as digital natives. In
the area of youth media protection, content is monitored in
accordance with different restrictions for each medium and
region to see if it could adversely affect the development of
children or young people. If there are any such indications,
various restrictions come into force, such as broadcasting
time restrictions or content and/or product labels. Through
voluntary labeling systems, Bertelsmann divisions and com-
panies sometimes go beyond the existing EU and national
regulations, particularly in the area of audiovisual media. In
addition, Bertelsmann companies are active in child and youth
media protection organizations.

Respect for Human Rights

Bertelsmann is committed to respecting and protecting human
rights within the company and in its supply chains. This stance
is anchored in the Code of Conduct and is expressed through
the voluntary commitment to external guidelines, e.g., the
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Free &
Equal principles of the United Nations or the OECD Guidelines
for Multinational Enterprises. The goal is to minimize the risk
of human rights violations and discrimination to the greatest
possible extent.

For this reason, the Bertelsmann Executive Board established
an Integrity & Compliance program and appointed a Corporate
Compliance Committee (CCC). The CCC submits an annual
Compliance Report to the Bertelsmann Executive Board
and the Audit and Finance Committee. The CCC chair is the
head of the Corporate Legal Department. The Integrity &
Compliance (I&C) department is responsible for implementing
the topic, and is subordinated to the CCC in the organization.
l&C supports the CCC in fulfilling its tasks and makes sugges-
tions for necessary improvements to the I&C program. I&C
ensures that employees worldwide are made aware of the key
legal provisions and internal company guidelines, including
those concerning respect for human rights.

Bertelsmann is aware that its responsibility for human rights
also goes beyond its own business operations. Respect for
human rights within the supply chain is also expressly stipu-
lated by the Bertelsmann Code of Conduct and the Supplier
Code of Conduct. This includes a ban on coercive and child
labor, the reaffirmation of the right to freedom of association
and the right to engage in collective bargaining, and a ban on
discrimination and intimidation. When it comes to business
partners, the Supplier Code of Conduct also stipulates that

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2021 49


--- Page 47 ---

Bertelsmann does not tolerate discrimination because of any
characteristic specified under applicable antidiscrimination
law or company policy. Infringements of these principles can
be reported by Bertelsmann employees and third parties by
using the existing compliance management systems.

With regard to measures, Code of Conduct training sessions
were also held in 2021 to raise awareness and deepen the
general understanding of the issue of human rights among
employees. In this context, measures to sensitize employees
to the issue of antidiscrimination were also taken across the
Group, and employees were advised of their rights. Contact
persons for the German “General Equal Treatment Act”
(AGG) have also been appointed at locations in Germany and
employees informed of their rights through various channels.
In addition, in 2021 individual subsidiaries and Bertelsmann
itself issued statements in accordance with the “UK Modern
Slavery Act” condemning all forms of modern slavery, coercive
and child labor, and exploitation and discrimination, and pre-
senting measures to prevent these human rights violations.
The company also initiated the revision of the Supplier Code
of Conduct to fulfil human-rights due diligence obligations in
supply chains. The findings of the Bertelsmann Compliance
Risk Analysis of 2021 show that the risks of human rights
violations and discrimination are minimized to the greatest
extent possible in view of the measures that have been taken.

Anti-Corruption and Bribery Matters

Bertelsmann actively combats corruption. As a participant in
the United Nations Global Compact, the company is committed
to taking a stance against all types of corruption, among
other things. A key priority of the Bertelsmann Executive
Board is to effectively counteract corruption within the
organization. The goal is to reduce the risk of corruption to the
greatest possible extent.

The I&C department, reporting to the CCC (see the section
on “Respect for Human Rights”), continuously develops the
Group's corruption prevention measures internationally.

Both the Bertelsmann Code of Conduct and the Executive
Board Guideline on anti-corruption and integrity expressly
prohibit all forms of corruption and bribery. This prohibition
also applies to all third parties that work for, with or on behalf
of Bertelsmann, as stipulated in the Supplier Code of Conduct.
Along with instructions for dealing with officials, and guide-
lines for the granting or accepting of gifts in the context of

50 Financial Information Combined Management Report

business relations, the Anti-Corruption and Integrity Executive
Board Guideline prescribes appropriate due diligence
processes in dealing with third parties. A due diligence
review is carried out for each individual risk profile through a
corresponding risk classification. The general business partner
risk and the supply chain risk are assessed annually as part
of the Bertelsmann Compliance Risk Analysis. The Anti-
Corruption and Integrity Executive Board Guideline also
describes the channels for reporting suspected violations
and seeking advice, as well as other prevention and control
measures. The Executive Board guideline for dealing with
alleged compliance violations anchors an obligation to report
suspected violations of the prohibition of corruption to the
Bertelsmann Corporate Center.

The most important measures in 2021 included publishing a new
Code of Conduct as well as designing a new Code of Conduct
training program that will be rolled out in 2022. Furthermore,
training on the topic of “Anti-Corruption & Integrity” was
provided to relevant employees across the Group and the
corruption risk outlined in the annual compliance report to the
Executive Board. The findings of the Bertelsmann Compliance
Risk Analysis of 2021 show that the measures taken minimize
the risk of corruption to the greatest extent possible.

Environmental Matters

Bertelsmann aspires to become climate-neutral by 2030. The
Group aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions
generated atits own sites due to business travel by its employees
and in the manufacture of its products by 2030, and to offset
all remaining emissions. The Group-wide target of cutting
recorded greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent compared
to 2018 was validated in 2021 by the Science Based Targets
initiative (SBTi). According to SBTi, the targeted reduction is in
line with the Paris Climate Agreement's 1.5°C target.

In 2021, on the basis of the “Bertelsmann Climate Neutral
2030” climate strategy, individual targets were established for
media and services divisions and for the education division,
and relevant measures identified. The achievement of these
division-specific targets is discussed as part of annual strategy
meetings between Executive Board members and divisional
heads. Group-wide guidelines constitute the framework for
environmental and climate protection as well as energy and
paper procurement. The “be green” working group with
representatives from the corporate divisions again provided
a platform for cross-divisional exchange on environmental

They are also used when processing ESG ratings.

On December 31, 2021, the number of sites using green
electricity was 181, a significant rise of 100 on the previous
year's figure of 81. The ongoing conversion of electricity
procurement to renewable energies using certificates of origin
led to a decrease in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope
1 and 2 combined, measured in carbon dioxide equivalents
CO,¢).

In 2021, further data was collected from suppliers and
business partners for the quantification of indirect Scope 3
emissions. Next to data gathering from paper manufacturers
and print service providers, the focus was on the analysis of
film productions and digital sources of CO, emissions.

Further Group-wide environmental key figures are published
in the second quarter of 2022 on the Bertelsmann website at
https://www.bertelsmann.com/environmental.

In addition to the climate strategy “Bertelsmann Climate
Neutral 2030,” the company defined additional strategic
objectives, and developed measures from those, as part of
the Bertelsmann CR Program (2021-2023). These objectives
include strengthening the governance for climate and
environmental protection, and further developing environ-
mental planning and reporting. In addition, the company
intends to increase the share of renewable energy (green

electricity, photovoltaics), implement new mobility concepts,
and advance energy efficiency, by the development of “Green IT”
and the measurement of the digital footprint. Emissions from
the print and digital products supply chain are to be reduced
in a joint effort with business partners.

EU Taxonomy

For the financial year 2021, the Group’s EU Taxonomy reporting
relates to the environmental objectives “Climate Change
Mitigation” and “Climate Change Adaptation.” This includes
information on the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible economic
activities in revenues, investments (CapEx) and operating
expenses (OpEx). For the group-wide implementation of the EU
Taxonomy requirements, Bertelsmann established a working
group consisting of the Corporate Responsibility, Corporate
Financial Reporting and Accounting departments, as well as
Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Together with the
divisions, the working group defined the eligible revenues,
CapEx and OpEx according to the EU Taxonomy. If revenues,
CapEx and OpEx can be assigned to both environmental
objectives “Climate Change Mitigation” and “Climate Change
Adaptation,” they are allocated in full to the environmental
target “Climate Change Mitigation” in the first reporting period.

Bertelsmann is a media, services and education company
that operates with a variety of business models in around
50 countries (see the section “Corporate Profile”). Bertelsmann’s
CO, emissions in the financial year 2021 were 18.2 tons of
CO,e per €1 million turnover (Scope 1 and 2). The company is
pursuing a reduction target of 50 percent by 2030 compared
to 2018, which has been validated by the SBTi (see the section
“Environmental Matters”).

So far, the company’s economic activities have been covered
by the EU Taxonomy to a limited extent.

With regard to the “Climate Change Mitigation” environmental
objective, Bertelsmann therefore reports solely on the “Data
processing, hosting and related activities” and “Data-based
solutions for greenhouse gas emissions reductions” of the
corporate division Arvato.

Regarding the “Climate Change Adaptation” environmental
objective, the following economic activities are classified as
relevant for Bertelsmann according to the EU Taxonomy:
“Broadcasting activities, in particular radio and television
broadcasting”; “Education”; “Production, distribution and
sale of films and television programs”; and “Music
publishing.” These economic activities relate to the corporate
divisions RTL Group, BMG and Bertelsmann Education
Group. The extent to which they can make a substantial
contribution to climate change adaptation is currently still
interpreted differently by users. The company therefore
chose not to report these economic activities in terms of
the EU Taxonomy in the financial year 2021. Bertelsmann
will observe the further specification of the EU Taxonomy
requirements on an ongoing basis.

Revenues: The basis for the revenues are the reported
revenues in the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with IFRS 15. The total Taxonomy-eligible revenues
in the 2021 financial year were €135 million (0.7 percent of
Group revenues), thereof €125 million for “Data processing,
hosting and related activities” and €10 million for “Data-driven
solutions for greenhouse gas emissions reductions.”

CapEx: Investments comprise the additions to intangible
assets, property, plant and equipment, and _right-of-use
assets. Bertelsmann invests in modernizing and improving
energy efficiency at its sites. In this context, investments
were made, e.g., in photovoltaic systems and in electric
vehicle charging stations.

For the financial year 2021, Bertelsmann reports material
individual investments that were made by subsidiaries
with Taxonomy-eligible investment activities. Like turnover,
investments in music, film and broadcasting rights in the
amount of €308 million are not classified as Taxonomy-
eligible. Furthermore, purchase of assets through business
combinations are not reported because the acquired assets
primarily consist of brand names and customer relationships,
which cannot be classified as sustainable under the EU
Taxonomy.

In the financial year 2021, total Taxonomy-eligible investments
of €58 million (7.3 percent of Group investments in intangible
assets without goodwill and property, plant and equipment)
largely involved investments in buildings (€27 million) and
data centers (€14 million). Investments in building usage
rights amounted to €185 million.

52 Financial Information Combined Management Report

OpEx: For the financial year 2021, as with CapEx reporting,
the company lists only operating repair and maintenance
expenditures (including maintenance expenses for
Taxonomy-eligible software) and expenditures arising from
short-term leases that were incurred at subsidiaries with
Taxonomy-eligible expenditures. Other expenses regarding
the day-to-day operation of property, plant and equipment are
not included in the operating expenses.

The Taxonomy-eligible operating expenses totaled €25 million
in the 2021 financial year (10 percent of Group-wide repair
and maintenance costs, and expenditures arising from short-
term leases).
