BILLERUDKORSNAS

A FIRST YEAR

—and a real step forward

When I look back over the first year of
BillerudKorsnis, I have to say I am pleased
with what we have achieved. Our expectations
of the new company were high and yet they
were exceeded on several fronts — in particular
the way we implemented the first and most
extensive phase of the integration. In other
respects things have been tougher, not least
dealing with the combination of a strong
Swedish krona and the continued weakness
of the European economy.

SMOOTH INTEGRATION
The teamwork within every section of the
company, at every level, is working exceed-
ingly well. We have thus raised our target
for synergies and savings from the acquisition
of Korsnas to SEK 530 million and we are
now confident of reaching that in 2014, a
year earlier than originally thought. All this
points to an organisation that is ready for
the task ahead and committed to delivering.
‘The integration is made up of many
sub-projects, each with their own objectives,
timeframes and project managers. Most of

these projects are delivering beyond expecta-
tions. I must say I am extremely proud of
the energy in the company and the fantastic
work that is being put into creating a strong
company for the long term. Naturally, there
is still much to do, and during 2014 we will
see a continued emphasis on integration,
alongside an increased focus on production
performance. In 2013 we unfortunately
experienced a few too many production-
related problems, but we have taken steps to
rectify this and these issues will be high on
the agenda over the next year.

SUSTAINABLE VALUE CREATION
BillerudKorsnis is built for sustainable
development for the future, to deliver
considerable value to customers and share-
holders. The acquisition of Korsnas and
UPM's packaging paper business in 2012
doubled sales and the company is now
stronger than ever. We have reduced our
exposure to the cyclical pulp market, we
have cut our relative exposure to foreign
currency fluctuations, we have a much

broader product portfolio and we have a
significantly higher share of sales in the
consumer segment, 75%. All this paves the
way for much greater stability and should
also be able to ensure strong cash flow over
time. Given this, I believe the results for
2013 do not truly reflect what the company
is capable of in the future. The operating
profit for the year was SEK 1 113 million,
based on sales of SEK 19 533 million.

DIFFERING TRENDS FOR THE THREE
BUSINESS AREAS

The Consumer Board business area is
characterised by long-standing customer
relations, high stability and a low dependence
on the economic cycle. Despite some
production problems, the business area
delivered a high and stable margin for 2013
of 8%. I expect this to continue over coming
years, having laid the foundations in 2013
by signing long-term agreements with all our
major customers in liquid packaging board.

BILLERUDKORSNAS

Our smart primary fibre-based
packaging solutions offer customers
sustainable alternatives, and the switch
away from non-renewable materials such
as plastic and metal is only in its infancy.

The Containerboard business area also
maintained a positive trend. Focusing on
customer value has brought greater stability
and margins over time — the margin for 2013
was 10% — and despite increasing competi-
tion, I believe we will be able to continue
defending our positions in this area.

‘The Packaging Paper business area has
experienced a tough market position, with
sizeable capacity being added to an already
weak market. A substantial weakening of
order books and a poorer product mix
resulted in a historically low margin of 4%
for 2013. It is highly likely to take a few
quarters for conditions to significantly
improve for the business area.

STRATEGIC GROWTH WITH
PROFITABILITY

BillerudKorsnis has set its sights on profitable
growth. The overall target is to achieve
organic sales growth of 15-20% by 2018.
The Consumer Board business area is to
grow by 4-5% per year, based on our long-
term customer relations. This will require
investments in both capacity and product
development. Within Containerboard, the
strategy is to continue developing products
and customer value and thus generate
growth of 2-4% per year in parallel with
strong long-term margins.

In Packaging Paper, we need to be more
selective when it comes to markets and
investments in quality and product develop-
ment. The market is growing by 0-4% per
year depending on the segment, and our
strategy is to focus on and develop profitable
growth segments and gradually withdraw

from less attractive areas in order to grow
with the market.

When we are able to strengthen the
balance sheet as planned, this will bring
opportunities for further acquisitions,
although that is a matter for the future.
In 2014 the focus will be on increased
margins and ensuring growth.

TARGETED INVESTMENTS

The ambition is to keep the pace of invest-
ment at around the same level as depreciation
and amortisation, in order that the balance
sheet does not expand. In order to pursue a
return on capital employed of 13%, we only
implement investments that offer this level
of return, and we are also conducting a
project to free up working capital. In the long
term I believe that, coupled with profitable
growth, this will drive the return up to the
target level.

WE CHALLENGE CONVENTIONS
Over the year, we expanded our resources in
research and development by 60% and
launched a whole new innovation organisa-
tion in the form of the New Business Lab.
Our aim is clear — we will challenge con-
ventional materials, conventional solutions
and, not least, plastics. We will drive and
lead the trend towards renewable materials
and solutions for the smart packaging of the
future. By investing in new technology, new
materials and continuous environmental
improvements, we are able to offer the best
value for brand owners and converters,
while also future-proofing the company.

STRONGER PRESENCE IN

GROWTH MARKETS

Our strategy expresses a need to look beyond
our traditional market of Europe. Although
there is a certain amount of growth to be
found in Europe, we are focusing on markets
with higher growth rates. In 2013 we opened
new sales offices in Bangkok and Singapore
to serve the South-East Asian markets, and
we strengthened the sales force in USA

to cover the markets of North and South
America. We also increased staff numbers in
Dubai to provide a better service for our
customers in the Middle East.

In August we acquired the remaining
70% of shares in US company Paccess, this
in order to strengthen our position in China
and our standing with American and
European brand owners. We are confident in
our ability to continue developing Paccess as
a platform initially for Containerboard,

hla

and then also for other business areas. The
acquisition of Paccess enables us to offer
global brand owners with manufacturing in
Asia quality-assured packaging solutions for
the whole region.

Our markets are growing by an average
of 3-4% per year. This trend is being driven
by rapid urbanisation around the world,
increasing prosperity, new consumption
patterns and greater environmental awareness.
All this offers huge opportunities for our own
growth. Our smart primary fibre-based
packaging solutions offer customers sustain-
able alternatives, and the switch away from
non-renewable materials such as plastic and
metal is only in its infancy. We contribute
to a sustainable everyday life for our
customers and for millions of consumers
around the world, day in day out.

INNOVATION IS OUR PASSION
Innovation is and will remain our driving
force. Sustainability is our guiding light.

BILLERUDKORSNAS

We look forward towards the materials and
solutions of tomorrow, we help our customers
with smart solutions that work, and we
build an open and creative environment,
within a large network of customers,
machine manufacturers, researchers and
specialists of various kinds. This is our way of
future-proofing BillerudKorsnas, attracting
the best employees and delivering value for
our customers and shareholders.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

The Board and CEO of BillerudKorsnas AB (publ), corporate identity number 556025-5001, herewith
submit the annual report and the consolidated annual accounts for the 2013 financial year.

BillerudKorsnas’ operating profit improved in 2013 to SEK 1 113
million. This was SEK 624 million, or 128%, higher than in 2012.
‘The increase was due primarily to the acquisitions of Korsnis and
UPM’s packaging business in Pietarsaari and Tervasaari in 2012.
BillerudKorsnas Corporate Governance Report appears on pages

54-63.

Market

BillerudKorsnis offers the global packaging market innovative and
sustainable products and services. The Group has a leading position
in primary fibre-based packaging paper and cartonboard. The trend
for the packaging market remains positive in the long term, primarily
due to increased globalisation, greater prosperity and changes in
consumption patterns. In addition to packaging materials, Billerud-
Korsnis sells long-fibre pulp, Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft
(NBSK), which is not used in its own production. BillerudKorsnis’
customers are primarily in Europe, although more and more deliveries
are going to other parts of the world.

During 2013 operations were divided into the three business areas:
Packaging Paper, Consumer Board and Containerboard.

Packaging Paper corresponds to the former business area Packaging
& Speciality Paper business area. Consumer Board includes the liquid
and packaging board business that were part of the Korsnis acquisition,
together with the Cup Stock and liquid board products previously
included in Packaging Boards business area. Containerboard corre-
sponds to the previous business area of Packaging Boards excluding
Cup Stock and liquid packaging board. Beginning on 29 November
in 2012 White Top Liner was added, which was part of the Korsnis
acquisition, to the business area.

Order levels were normal during the year, and relatively stable
for the businesses areas of Consumer Board and Containerboard.
Prices in local currency were lower than in the preceding year. A less
favourable currency situation resulted in further deterioration in
prices in SEK. For further market information, see the relevant
business area section.

In 2013, BillerudKorsnis’ total sales volume amounted to
2.591 000 tonnes, an increase of 63% from the previous year.

‘The increase was primarily attributable to the two acquisitions
made during 2012.

of the two acquisitions that were carried out in 2012. An operating
margin of 6% (5) was recorded.

Net financial items totalled SEK —285 million (-87). Profit
before tax was SEK 828 million and estimated tax SEK -142 million.

Earnings per operating segment

BillerudKorsnas applies IFRS 8 Operating Segments. BillerudKorsnis’
operating segments in accordance with IFRS 8 have been identified
and reflect its three business areas: Packaging Paper, Consumer
Board and Containerboard. See Accounting policies on page 28.

Packaging Paper

Packaging Paper offers premium-quality kraft and sack paper, as well
as functional solutions for many applications, including packaging for
foodstuffs, industrial purposes, medical applications and carrier bags,
for customers with exacting requirements.

‘The business area also sells any surplus of pulp that BillerudKorsnas
does not use in its own production. The business area Packaging Paper
both purchases and sells pulp at market price. As of 1 August 2013,
the business area's net exposure in market pulp is estimated to average
approximately 150 ktonnes annually. The business area's largest markets
are Europe and Asia.

Operating profit fell by SEK 68 million to SEK 284 million compared
with 2012. The decrease was primarily due to the negative impact of
the extensive rebuilding in Skarblacka during the third and fourth
quarters of 2013. The rebuilding had a negative earnings impact of
SEK 219 million in the third and fourth quarters. The negative effect
of a poorer foreign exchange situation was offset by higher prices in
local currency. Profit for 2013 was positively impacted compared
with the previous year because the business in Finland acquired in
June 2012 had an impact on the entire year.

Market Development
Orders received for white sack paper were lower than normal for the
year. Orders received were normal for other product families. The
prices in local currency were higher than the previous year. During
the last quarter they fell slightly as a result of new market capacity.
The market for NBSK pulp improved steadily throughout the
year. Prices in Europe rose to approximately USD 910 per tonne at
year-end, compared with approximately USD 810 per tonne at the
beginning of the year.

BILLERUDKORSNAS ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Consumer Board

The Consumer Board business area develops and markets high-quality
cartonboard used in packaging for beverages, yoghurt, refrigerated and
frozen food products and other consumer goods. Smart solutions

in function, design and material selection add further value for the
customer. Europe is the largest market.

Consumer Board has been a new business area in the Group since 29
November 2012. The business area includes the liquid and packaging
board activities that were part of the Korsnis acquisition, together
with the sales of the Cup Stock and liquid board products that were
previously included in the Containerboard business areas (formerly
Packaging Boards).

Operating profit was SEK 557 million for full-year 2013. A
comparison with 2012 would not be meaningful given that the
business area was formed on 29 November 2012.

Market Development

Orders received for liquid and packaging board were stable and
satisfactory during the year with normal seasonal variations. Prices
in local currency were stable, compared with the preceding year.

Containerboard

The Containerboard business area offers corrugated board raw material
that provides light but strong packaging for demanding transportation
uses and primary packaging. An important part of the offering is
consultation for packaging optimisation and efficient logistical flows.
‘The business area also includes Paccess, which strengthens Billerud-
Korsnas’ position in offering packaging solutions to brand owners
and is the next step in challenging conventional packaging.

At the start of the fourth quarter 2012, the Packaging Boards
business area was renamed. Containerboard. On 29 November 2012,
the business area incorporated the White Top Liner business, part of
the Korsniis acquisition. At the same time, sales of the Cup Stock
and liquid board products were transferred to the Consumer Board
business area.

due to more favourable price trends in local currency and the contribu-
tion by White Top Liner. Paccess reported strong sales growth and
improved gross margin.

BILLERUDKORSNAS

Market Development
‘The order situation was stable during most of the year. Sales prices in
local currency was also stable during the year.

Investments and capital employed

Gross investments including company acquisitions amounted to
SEK 1 268 million (9 913) in 2013. The reduction from the previous
year was due to the acquisition of the two paper machines in Finland
in June 2012 and the merger with Korsnas in November 2012.

In late 2013, the board approved the initial investments in greater
capacity in Frévi and Gavle in line with the company’s growth plans
in the attractive liquid packaging board market.

BillerudKorsnis’ capital employed at 31 December 2013 totalled
SEK 17 607 million (17 530). Return on capital employed, calculated
over the past 12-month period, amounted to 6% (8). If the effects of
currency hedging are excluded, return on capital employed was 6% (5).
Return on equity after tax was 7% (13).

Cash Flow and Financial Position

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS, SUMMARY

SEKm (positive figure indicates reduction in debt) 2013 2012

Net financial items, taxes, etc. —401 12
Cash flow from operating activiti 1845 1002

Operating cash flow 655 50

Cash flow from operating activities in 2013 amounted to SEK 1 845
million (1 002) and the operating cash flow was SEK 655 million
(50). The reason was a higher operating surplus due to the total
business having growth through acquisitions.

Net interest-bearing debt on 31 December 2013 was SEK 7 691
million (8 096). The Group’s net debt/equity ratio at the end of the
period was 0.78 (0.86). BillerudKorsnas’ financial target for its net
debt/equity ratio is that it shall be less than 0.90.

Note 14 presents the effect of reporting BillerudKorsnis’ share of
Bomhus Energi AB's income, expenses, assets and liabilities according
to IFRS 11, which will take place from January 1, 2014. If the new
policy had been applied in 2013, the net debt/equity ratio would
have increased to a multiple of 0.85.

Significant risks and uncertainties
BillerudKorsnas’ products are generally dependent on the business
cycle, in terms of both price development and potential sales volumes.
The Group is exposed to currency fluctuations, since most revenues
are invoiced in foreign currency, while a large part of operating
expenses are in SEK.

For a more detailed description of risks and a sensitivity analysis,
see pages 21-26.

Taxes

The Group’s effective tax rate is estimated at about 22-23% normally.
Effective 1 January 2013, Sweden's statutory tax rate was reduced
from 26.3% to 22.0%. The tax rate in Finland was lowered from
24.5% to 20% as of 1 January 2014. The tax rate in the foreign
subsidiaries is on average somewhat higher than the Swedish tax rate.
‘The tax expense for 2013 is estimated at SEK 142 million, equivalent
to a tax rate of 17.2%. The low tax rate is due primarily to the

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

additional impact of the tax reduction in Sweden as of 1 January
2013 (SEK -17 million), and reversal of a previous tax provision
that had not been realized (SEK -13 million).

Parent company

The parent company BillerudKorsnis AB includes the Gruvén
production unit, the sales organisation for the Nordic market and
markets outside Europe, and the head office functions.

Net sales for 2013 amounted to SEK 3 816 million (4 160).
Operating profit totalled SEK 205 million (203).

‘The parent company hedges both its own and the Group’s net
currency flows. The parent company’s earnings include the results of
these hedging measures. This result amounted to SEK 12 million
(142) in 2013.

In 2013, investments in property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets excluding shares totalled SEK 136 million (160). The
average number of employees was 948 (941). Cash and bank balances
and short-term investments amounted to SEK 292 million (556).

Environment and permit issues

BillerudKorsnis has six operations in Sweden, two in Finland and
one in the UK that require permits under environmental legislation.
These permits apply to the production of pulp and paper. Billerud-
Korsnis has all official permits necessary to conduct operations at the
volumes produced in 2013. The environmental impact of operations
is mainly in the form of emissions to air and water and the creation
of waste and noise.

BillerudKorsnis’ Swedish production units have been awarded
emission rights for carbon dioxide within the EU. The allocation for
both the five-year period that began in 2008 and the eight-year
period that began in 2013 exceeds total projected emissions.

Completed long-term incentive programme (LTIP 2010)
The AGM 2010 resolved to introduce a long-term incentive programme
(LTIP 2010) for BillerudKorsnas for 2010-2012. In accordance with
the programme, 218 202 rights fell due, including the effect of the
completed preferential rights issue. 75% of the performance targets
for the programme were met. Dilution of outstanding shares was less
than 0.1%. The total cost of the programme was expensed on an
ongoing basis in 2010-2013.

Long-term incentive programme (LTIP 2011)

The 2011 AGM approved the introduction of a long-term incentive
programme (LTIP 2011) for BillerudKorsnas and in that connection
a transfer of its own holding of its own shares. The purpose of LTIP
2011 is partly to increase BillerudKorsnis’ ability to retain its best
talents for critical leadership positions, and partly to encourage those
participating into greater efforts, by linking their interests and view-
points with those of the shareholders. The programme extends to no
more than 20 senior executives and other key people in the Billerud-
Korsnas Group. LTIP 2011 has a term of three years starting in 2011
and the outcome depends on meeting different financial and share
price performance requirements that are deemed to be of great
significance in terms of the future development of the Group. To
participate in LTIP 2011, a person must own BillerudKorsnis shares
referred to as “saving shares”. Following a three-year vesting period
that begins on the date the agreement for LTIP 2011 is entered into
and ends when BillerudKorsnis releases its interim report for the
first quarter of 2014, those participating will be allocated at no

Korsnis shares provided that certain criteria are met. For both rights,
the participant must remain throughout the vesting period an
employee of the BillerudKorsnas Group and must not sell his/her
saving shares. The rights are personal and cannot be transferred or
pledged. They do not entitle shareholder rights and no adjustment
for dividend is made. For the rights to performance shares, additional
financial performance targets must be met. The requirements are
based on: (a) BillerudKorsnis’ average operating margin for the
period 2011-2013 in absolute terms; (b) BillerudKorsnis’ operating
margin in relation to that of a benchmark group consisting of
specially selected listed Nordic companies for the same period; (c)
BillerudKorsnas’ total return for the period 2011-2013 in comparison
with that of a benchmark group consisting of listed Nordic companies.
The performance requirements (a) and (c) give shares on a straight-
line basis between minimum and maximum levels, while performance
requirement (b) involves a digital procedure.

On 31 December 2013 LTIP 2011 comprised 18 259 saving
shares in total, which entails the allocation of in total no more than
91 295 BillerudKorsnas shares. Moreover LTIP 2011 consists of an
additional 64 000 BillerudKorsnis shares that are related to shares
that can be transferred by BillerudKorsnis for the purpose of covering
certain payments, chiefly social fees. Thus the maximum number of
BillerudKorsniis shares included in LTIP 2011 is 155 295, representing
about 0.1% of the total number of BillerudKorsnas shares outstanding
and number of votes outstanding.

‘The cost of LTIP 2011 is estimated at about SEK 5 million,
including SEK 2 million in social fees. The maximum cost of
LTIP 2011 based on the above assumptions is estimated at about
SEK 11 million, including SEK 7 million in social fees. In 2013,
SEK 2 million was charged to operating profit.

For further details of LTIP 2011, see the press release dated
30 March 2011 and the documents for the 2011 AGM, which are
available on the BillerudKorsnis website.

Long-term incentive programme (LTIP 2012)

The 2012 AGM approved the introduction of a long-term incentive
programme (LTIP 2012) for BillerudKorsnis and in that connection
a transfer of its own holding of its own shares. The purpose of LTIP
2012 is partly to increase BillerudKorsnis’ ability to retain its best
talents for critical leadership positions, and partly to encourage those
participating into greater efforts, by linking their interests and view-
points with those of the shareholders. The programme extends to no
more than 20 senior executives and other key people in the Billerud-
Korsnis Group. LTIP 2012 has a term of three years starting in 2012
and the outcome depends on meeting different financial and share
price performance requirements that are deemed to be of great sig-
nificance in terms of the future development of the Group. To par-
ticipate in LTIP 2012, a person must own BillerudKorsnis shares
referred to as “saving shares”. Following a three-year vesting period
that begins on the date the agreement for LTIP 2012 is entered into
and ends when BillerudKorsnis releases its interim report for the first
quarter of 2015, those participating will be allocated at no charge
one right to matching shares and three rights to performance shares for
each saving share. These rights entitle holders to BillerudKorsnis
shares provided that certain criteria are met. For both rights, the par-
ticipant must remain throughout the vesting period an employee of
the BillerudKorsnas Group and must not sell his/her saving shares.
The rights are personal and cannot be transferred or pledged. They
do not entitle shareholder rights and no adjustment for dividend is
made. For the rights to performance shares, additional financial per-
formance targets must be met. The requirements are based on: (a)

BILLERUDKORSNAS ANNUAL REPORT 2013

BillerudKorsnés’ average operating margin for the period 2012-2014
in absolute terms; (b) BillerudKorsnas’ operating margin in relation
to that of a benchmark group consisting of specially selected listed
Nordic companies for the same period; (c) BillerudKorsnas’ total
return for the period 2012-2014 in comparison with that of a bench-
mark group consisting of listed Nordic companies. The performance
requirements (a) and (c) give shares on a straight-line basis between
minimum and maximum levels, while performance requirement (b)
involves a digital procedure.

On 31 December 2013, LTIP 2012 comprised 44 214 saving
shares in total, which entails the allocation of in total no more than
221 070 BillerudKorsnas shares. Moreover LTIP 2012 consists of an
additional 57 000 BillerudKorsnis shares that are related to shares
that can be transferred by BillerudKorsnis for the purpose of cover-
ing certain payments, chiefly social fees. Thus the maximum number
of BillerudKorsnis shares included in LTIP 2012 is 278 070, repre-
senting about 0.1% of the total number of BillerudKorsnas shares
outstanding and number of votes outstanding.

Based on a theoretical assumption of an annual 20% increase in
share price, from SEK 46.8 when the programme started, and a
vesting period of three years, the cost of LTIP 2012 is estimated at
about SEK 8 million, including social fees of SEK 4 million. The
maximum cost of LTIP 2012 based on the above assumptions is
estimated at about SEK 22 million, including SEK 15 million in
social fees. In 2013, SEK 4 million was charged to operating profit.

For further details of LTIP 2012, see the press release dated
2 April 2012, as well as the documents for the 2012 AGM, which
are available on the BillerudKorsnis website.

Long-term incentive programme (LTIP 2013)

The 2013 AGM approved the introduction of a long-term incentive
programme (LTIP 2011) for BillerudKorsniis and in that connection
a transfer of its own holding of its own shares. The purpose of LTIP
2013 is partly to increase BillerudKorsnis’ ability to retain its best
talents for critical leadership positions, and partly to encourage those
participating into greater efforts, by linking their interests and view-
points with those of the shareholders. The programme extends to no
more than 25 senior executives and other key people in the Billerud-
Korsnis Group. LTIP 2013 has a term of three years starting in 2013
and the outcome depends on meeting different financial and share
price performance requirements that are deemed to be of great sig-
nificance in terms of the future development of the Group. To par-
ticipate in LTIP 2013, a person must own BillerudKorsnis shares
referred to as “saving shares”. Following a three-year vesting period
that begins on the date the agreement for LTIP 2013 is entered into
and ends when BillerudKorsnis releases its interim report for the first
quarter of 2016, those participating will be allocated at no charge
one right to matching shares and three rights to performance shares
for each saving share. These rights entitle holders to BillerudKorsnas
shares provided that certain criteria are met. For both rights, the par-
ticipant must remain throughout the vesting period an employee of
the BillerudKorsnas Group and must not sell his/her saving shares.
The rights are personal and cannot be transferred or pledged. They do
not entitle shareholder rights and no adjustment for dividend is
made. For the rights to performance shares, additional financial per-
formance targets must be met. The requirements are based on: (a)

requirements (a) and (c) give shares on a straight-line basis between
minimum and maximum levels, while performance requirement (b)
involves a digital procedure.

On 31 December 2013, LTIP 2013 comprised 63 959 saving
shares in total, which entails the allocation of in total no more than
289 304 BillerudKorsnas shares. Moreover LTIP 2013 consists of an
additional 76 000 BillerudKorsnis shares that are related to shares
that can be transferred by BillerudKorsnis for the purpose of covering
certain payments, chiefly social fees. Thus the maximum number of
BillerudKorsnas shares included in LTIP 2013 is 331 836, representing
about 0.2% of the total number of BillerudKorsnas shares outstanding
and number of votes outstanding.

Based on a theoretical assumption of an annual 12% increase in
share price, from SEK 60.50 when the programme started, and a
vesting period of three years, the cost of LTIP 2013 is estimated at
about SEK 10 million, including social fees of SEK 4 million. The
maximum cost of LTIP 2013 based on the above assumptions is
estimated at about SEK 33 million, including SEK 21 million in
social fees. In 2013, SEK 2 million was charged to operating profit.

For further details of LTIP 2013, see the press release dated
30 March 2013 and the documents for the 2013 AGM, which are
available on the BillerudKorsnis website.

Product and process development

‘The costs of product and process development, to the extent attributable
to research activities, are charged to profit in the year that they arise.
In the past year, such costs accounted for approximately 0.3% of
BillerudKorsnis’ operating costs.

Seasonal factors

BillerudKorsnas’ business is to a relatively limited extent subject to
seasonal fluctuations. Periodical maintenance shutdowns have the
largest impact, as each production unit halts production for around
one week. The loss of production results in somewhat lower deliveries
over an extended period before, during and after the shutdown.
BillerudKorsnas’ costs are relatively stable throughout the year.
Fixed costs are slightly lower in the summer, however, due to fewer
maintenance projects. Energy costs are slightly higher in the winter
because of higher energy consumption and normally higher energy
prices, especially for electricity.

Maintenance shutdowns

In addition to ongoing maintenance during production, Billerud-
Korsnis’ production units normally also require more extensive
maintenance at some point during the year. In order to carry out
maintenance, production of pulp and paper is stopped in what are
known as maintenance shutdowns. The principal items of cost in a
maintenance shutdown are loss of volume arising from the shutdown
and fixed costs, mainly costs of maintenance and overtime work, as
well as a certain portion of variable costs including higher consump-
tion of electricity and wood when production is restarted. The effects
of shutdowns on earnings vary depending on the extent of measures
carried out, their nature and the actual length of the shutdown.

‘The estimated cost of shutdown is an assessment of the impact on
earnings of a normal shutdown, compared to a quarter during which
no periodic maintenance shutdown takes place.

Maintenance shutdowns at Beetham, Rockhammar and Tervasaari do not have a significant
effect on BillerudKorsnas’ total earnings.

Previously some of the costs were capitalized and written off until the
next maintenance shutdown. As of 1 January 2013 all costs associated
with maintenance stops will be expensed.

Early in the fourth quarter, production resumed in Skarblacka
after an environmental and energy investment had been completed
in connection with the annual maintenance shutdown.

Other seasonal effects

A considerable share of volumes for BillerudKorsnas Flute® are used
for packaging for exporting fruit from the Mediterranean area.
Demand by this group of customers varies with the fruit export
season and is ordinarily highest in September—March. A considerable
share of BillerudKorsnas’ sack paper and QuickFill® sack paper goes
to packaging for cement and building materials The demand for
building materials in Europe is generally higher in May—October.

Financing

On 31 December 2013 interest-bearing loans amounted to SEK 7 532
million (8 105). Of this amount, utilisation of the syndicated credit
facility (maximum: SEK 5 500 million) accounted for SEK 813 million
(3 110), bond loans for SEK 1 644 million (675), utilisation of
BillerudKorsnas’ commercial paper programme (maximum: SEK

3 000 million) for SEK 2 457 million (671) and other interest-bearing
liabilities for SEK 2 618 million (3 649).

In 2013 the Group established a bond programme for Medium
Term Notes (MTN) with a facility of SEK 5 000 million — two
five-year bonds totalling SEK 1 500 million were issued in March.
The commercial paper programme facility increased from SEK 1 500
million to SEK 3 000 million. The syndicated credit facility runs
until November 2015.

Financial targets
In November 2012 BillerudKorsnas’ Board of Directors established
the following long-term financial targets:

© Over an economic cycle, the operating margin shall exceed 10%.

© Over an economic cycle, the return on capital employed shall
exceed 13%.

© The net debt/equity ratio should be less than 0.9.

© Over an economic cycle, the dividend shall average out at 50%
of net profit.

BILLERUDKORSNAS ANNUAL REPORT 2013

The targets focus on long-term growth. The operating margin target
creates greater transparency in governance and a better link between
internal operational financial targets and those communicated externally.

The BillerudKorsnas share
‘The share capital of BillerudKorsnis AB is represented by 208 219 834
ordinary shares, of which 1 500 145 are owned by BillerudKorsnas AB.
Each share carries an entitlement to one vote at the AGM. Transfer
of shares is not restricted by law or by the Company’s articles of
association. The 2013 Annual General Meeting (AGM) authorised
the Board of Directors to decide as to any transfer of shares held by
the Company, hold in order to cover the allocation during the
approved long-term incentive programs.

‘The largest shareholder, Frapag Beteiligungsholding AG, owned
31 300 000 shares, corresponding to 15.19% of shares in the market.
No other shareholder owned 10% or more of the total number of
shares on 31 December 2013. The Company knows of no agreements
between shareholders that may restrict the right to transfer shares.
Appointment and dismissal of Board members, and changes to
the articles of association, are subject to approval by the AGM.
Agreements exist between the Company, other Group companies and
senior executives that entail compensation if they were to resign, be
dismissed without reasonable grounds or if their employment were to
end due to a public bid to acquire shares in the Company. These
agreements are described in note 24. Agreements between the Com-
pany and other employees that regulate their own resignation or dis-
missal by the Company accord with normal labour market practice.

Guidelines for remuneration to senior executives
‘The Board proposes that the 2014 AGM approve the following guide-
lines for remuneration to senior executives. Senior management
includes the CEO and other members of the Senior Management Team.
BillerudKorsnis shall apply market-related remuneration levels
and employment terms that are appropriate in order to recruit and
retain a management team that has the high level of competence and
capacity to achieve set goals. Remuneration forms shall motivate
Group management to do its utmost in the best interests of the
Company’s shareholders. Remuneration may be in the form of fixed or
variable salary, long-term incentive programmes and other benefits
such as company car and pension. Fixed and variable salary shall be
determined in relation to expertise, area of responsibility and per-
formance. Variable remuneration is paid depending on actual results
compared to explicit targets, up to a maximum percentage of a fixed
annual salary that may vary between 30% and 70%. However, variable
salary shall be paid only if the Company makes an operating profit.
Long-term incentive programmes at the Company shall primarily be
linked to certain predetermined financial and share price performance
requirements. The programmes shall ensure long-term commitment
to the development of the Company and shall be implemented on
commercial terms. Long-term incentive programmes shall have a term
of at least three years. For further details of the existing long-term
incentive programmes adopted by the 2011, 2012 and 2013 AGMs,
see the Company’s website and the sections “Long-term incentive
programme (LTIP 2011)”, “Long-term incentive programme
(LTIP 2012)” and “Long-term incentive programme (LTIP 2013)”.
Pension benefits shall either be defined-benefit or defined-
contribution plans and will normally give a pension entitlement
after age 65. In certain cases, the age may be reduced but never lower
than 62. Notice of termination is normally 6-12 months, and if
the Company gives notice, severance pay shall be a maximum of 12
months’ salary.

Remuneration and other employment terms for the CEO are
prepared by the remuneration committee and ruled on by the Board.
Remuneration and other employment terms for members of the
Senior Management Team are determined by the CEO following
approval by the remuneration committee.

The Board of Directors of BillerudKorsnis is entitled to deviate
from these guidelines if there is good reason in individual cases.

Risk management in parent company
For a description of the Group's risk management, see the section
titled “Risk management and sensitivity analysis”. The description
applies, where appropriate, to both the Group and parent company.
Specific differences concerning the parent company receive comment
under this heading.

For an understanding of the risk exposure in the parent company,
the following should be taken into account.

Customer credit

‘The parent company’s accounts receivable represent more than 90%
of the Group's accounts receivable, because a large share of the
production units accounts receivable are taken over by the parent
company after invoicing and the monies collected by the parent
company. However, the risk of any bad debts remains with the
invoicing company. Of total provision within the Group for doubtful
accounts receivable in 2013, SEK 3 million (6) was attributable to
the parent company.

Exchange-rate exposure

All forward foreign exchange contracts for the Swedish operations
are taken out by the parent company, while the exposure to payment
flows in foreign currency is borne by all the Swedish production
units. Exposure for the parent company is thus lower than that of
the forward contracts signed. This applies up to the invoicing date,
because the parent company takes over the accounts receivable for
the Swedish production units. At year-end 2013, foreign exchange
contracts not yet recognised in profit/loss totalled a nominal

SEK 3 721 million (2 679) and all foreign exchange contracts will
be recognised in profit/loss in 2014.

Interest rate risk

The Group's borrowing is conducted primarily via the parent
company and accounted for 82% of the Group's total borrowing on
31 December 2013. As a result, the parent company has largely the
same exposure to changes in interest rates as the Group. All interest
derivatives are attributable to the parent company.

Costs

Energy

The parent company is the contracted party in all electricity hedging
contracts, which are based on electricity consumption at the six Swedish
production facilities. The parent company’s exposure is therefore less
than the total hedged amounts. However, when the contract is settled,
any profit or loss on the contract is distributed in proportion to

the forecast consumption of each production unit. Consequently
the parent company’s earnings are only affected by the amount
corresponding to the parent company’s (Gruvén production unit)
electricity consumption. During 2013, the Company had no electricity
hedging contracts.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Proposed allocation of profit

As shown on page 52 of this annual report, non-restricted equity in
the parent company, BillerudKorsnas AB, amounted to SEK 5 334
million on 31 December 2013.

According to BillerudKorsnis’ financial targets, the dividend shall
equal 50% of the net earnings per share over a business cycle and the
net debt/equity ratio shall be less than 0.90 over a business cycle. At
the end of 2013, the Company’s net debt/equity ratio was 0.78, 0.08
lower than at the end of 2012. BillerudKorsnis’ Board of Directors
proposes that, of the earnings per share of SEK 3.24, SEK 2.25 per
share be paid to shareholders and that the remaining amount be
carried forward.

Events after the close of the financial year
No events that materially affect the company’s financial position
have occurred after the the close of the financial year.

Outlook

© The outlook for all business areas appears to be stable for the first
quarter of 2014. For the remainder of 2014, the market outlook
for the business areas of Packaging Paper and Containerboard is
more uncertain.

© Prices in local currency are anticipated to stay on current level
for the next quarter for all business areas. Business areas
Containerboard and Packaging Paper are anticipating some
pressure on prices in local currency beyond the first quarter.

© Wood prices during the first half of 2014 are expected to remain
at the same level as at the end of 2013.

© The target of approximately SEK 530 million in annual synergies
and savings is unchanged and is expected to be reached by the
end of 2014.
