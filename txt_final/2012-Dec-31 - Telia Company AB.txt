TeliaSonera Annual Report 2012

> Introduction

TeliaSonera in brief

Communication the easy way

TeliaSonera has its roots in the Nordic telecom market and holds strong positions
in the Nordic and Baltic countries, Eurasia and Spain. Our core business is to
create better communication opportunities for people and businesses through
mobile and broadband communication services.

TeliaSonera creates a
world with better opportunities

We help people communicate with family, friends and
business contacts in an easy, efficient and environ-
mentally friendly way. We do this by providing high
quality telecommunication services in the Nordic and
Baltic countries, the emerging markets of Eurasia,
including Russia and Turkey, and in Spain. Our ambition
is to be a leading operator in all our markets, by
providing the best customer experience, high-quality
networks and cost-efficient operations.

We are an international group

We have majority-owned operations from the Nordics
to Nepal, with more than 71 million subscriptions at
year-end 2012 as well as almost 112 million subscrip-
tions in our associated companies, mainly in Russia
and Turkey. We are also the leading European whole-
sale provider with a wholly-owned international carrier
network.

We want to help our
customers get connected
We offer high-quality services such as mobile

broadband via 4G, digital home and fiber services
to ensure we can meet future demands.

We are organized into
three business areas

Mobility Services, Broadband Services and Eurasia are
our three business areas. In the Nordic and Baltic re-
gions we provide mobile and fixed line services includ-
ing TV. In Eurasia and Spain we offer mobile services.

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2012

> Introduction

The year in brief

2012 — an eventful year

e We continued the roll-out of both fiber as well as 4G
and extended our TV offerings, by for example intro-
ducing HBO and Play+. Reduced dataroaming prices
were brought to new destinations and Spotify was

launched in several markets.

© We initiated an efficiency program that will lead
to cost reductions of SEK 2 billion net over the
coming two years, including personnel reductions
net of 2,000 employees in the Nordics and Baltics.
At the same time, we see a need to recruit new

competence.

© We partnered with the Danish Institute for Human
Rights (DIHR) to define and support an internal
assessment of risks that could potentially lead to
involvement in human rights violations. In particular,
freedom of expression and privacy are growing in
importance for companies across the ICT sector.

© We successfully managed to settle a long standing

ownership dispute in Russian MegaFon and

completed an initial public offering of the company
by the end of the year. It is amazing that our invest-
ment of a mere SEK 1.2 billion since the company’s
inception in 1994 has grown to around SEK 55 billion
including dividends, sale of shares and the value of

our remaining 25 percent ownership.

e We successfully completed an initial public offering
of Kazakh Kcell during the fall and decided to divest

Norwegian NextGentTel.

e We were accused of bribery and money laundering
in connection with our investments in Uzbekistan
in 2007 and 2010. The Board appointed an external
investigation that could neither prove nor completely
reject the accusations. The investigation complained
of deficiencies in the implementation of the deal and
that the company violated its own ethical guidelines.
In a statement, the Board agreed in the criticism, and

shared the same.

Our financial position is solid and at year-end free
cash flow was record high and we delivered the
second highest earnings per share, at SEK 4.59,
since the merger between Telia and Sonera in 2002.

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2012

> Introduction

Letter from the CEO

Dear shareholders,

The year of 2012 was a strong one, both financially and operationally. We delivered a
good profit, despite a downturn in the global economy. We resolved the ownership
conflict at MegaFon, which has dragged on for many years, and carried out stock-
market flotations that helped to produce a strong cash flow. At the same time, some

of our investments in Eurasia were criticized.

Second best result in ten years

We have a lot to be proud of. Despite an uncertain and
troubling macroeconomic climate, last year we suc-
ceeded in achieving our second best result in the ten
years that have elapsed since Telia and Sonera merged.
Amidst the global economic downturn, we managed
to consolidate and strengthen our position. All opera-
tions in Business area Eurasia reported higher sales,
generating growth of 14 percent. This compensated for
slightly lower sales in the Mobility Services and Broad-
band Services business areas.

Since the merger in 2002, TeliaSonera has delivered
dividends totaling SEK 117 billion. This corresponds
to SEK 26 per share, excluding share buy-backs. The
number of subscriptions has risen from 19 million to
nearly 71 million in our majority-owned businesses
and to a total of 183 million if we include businesses in
which we hold a minority stake.

High pressure for change and strong
pressure on prices

The customers’ appetite for bandwidth is more or less
unlimited. In practically every home and in just about
every workplace, the need for mobile and fixed data
communications is growing, as new services and com-
munication tools enter everyday use.

Ten years ago, telephones were used exclusively for
voice calls and texting. In the workplace, e-mail was
the only form of electronic communication, and the
computer was the only terminal connected to the inter-
net. In the evening, all the family got together around
the same TV.

Today, every member of the family uses broadband
services via their own computer, smartphone or tablet.
Businesses and organizations communicate with
customers and personnel via apps, social media, video-
conferencing and Twitter.

In 2012, mobile data traffic on TeliaSonera’s network
expanded by nearly 80 percent. That is a very substan-
tial increase but income is not keeping pace, rising by
only a little over 20 percent. Our income from mobile
voice calls fell by 10 percent, while the volume re-
mained largely unchanged.

Dealing with pressure on prices and constantly rising
demand for capacity, while coping with falling income
from voice calls, will be the major challenge for Telia-
Sonera and the industry as a whole. We will meet this
challenge in three ways:

We will continue to invest in our networks and
services in order to always have the market’s most
attractive offerings. We will introduce a new pricing
structure that better reflects our customers’ patterns of
consumption and we will reduce our costs.

In 2012, we invested nearly SEK 16 billion in infra-
structure, licenses for mobile network and fiber. We
have now launched 4G in all the Nordic and Baltic
markets, as well as in several countries in Eurasia. In
2013, we will continue to expand our 4G networks. No
other company is investing more in infrastructure in
Sweden than TeliaSonera.

We will carry on developing new applications and
services with the leading players in the market. Dur-
ing the year, we were the first Nordic operator to sign
an agreement with the USA TV channel HBO, which
offers new series the day after showing in the USA. We
partnered with Samsung in developing IPTV technology
enabling our customers to watch TV without a set-top
box.

In 2012, we embarked on a program aimed at sav-
ings of SEK 2 billion. The savings will be achieved partly
by introducing new, more efficient ways of working and
partly by exploiting the benefits of new technology.

The high pressure for change in the industry is nota
negative factor; it is an opportunity to develop competi-
tiveness. TeliaSonera possesses a unique combination
of business volume, financial strength, expertise and

along-term perspective. We are one of the biggest
telecom operators in Europe. We have a very strong
balance sheet. We have expert personnel and a long
tradition of being at the cutting edge of technology.

Successful stockmarket flotations

During the year, we succeeded in resolving the dead-
locked ownership situation at MegaFon, a situation
that had lasted for many years. Now that we have clear
ownership conditions and have floated the company
on the London and Moscow stockmarkets, we have
achieved our aim of transparent direct ownership of
Russia’s second-largest mobile operator. Our invest-
ment of SEK 1.2 billion since the company was formed
in 1994 has yielded around SEK 55 billion, an outstand-
ingly good return.

In line with the strategy of increasing the level of
ownership in our core holdings, we acquired a minor-
ity stake in Kcell, our biggest operator in Eurasia, early
in the year. Just before year-end, we also fulfilled our
commitment to float the company in London and Al-
maty, Kazakhstan stock exchanges.

The flotations contributed to a record-high cash flow,
which was used primarily to reduce our indebtedness.
In addition, we were able to maintain an unchanged divi-
dend of SEK 2.85 per share. This is in an era when many
operators are cutting, or opting not to pay, dividend.

Eurasia — growth but criticism too

TeliaSonera’s seven companies in Eurasia remain our
engines of growth, with high margins and four times as
many subscriptions today as in 2007.

Through our presence in Eurasia, we are generating
growth for our shareholders, but even more important
are the opportunities that our services create in the
countries where we have set up business. Few tools
are better for economic and personal development
than access to the internet and mobile telephony. They
enable people to communicate with each other and
the outside world in a way that was not possible a few
years ago, and they open up previously closed socie-
ties to the outside world. Our contribution is through
our investment in important infrastructure, and through
provision of communication services at affordable
prices to the vast majority of the population.

In September, allegations were made in the media
that TeliaSonera had been involved in bribery during
establishment of operations in Uzbekistan in 2007. The
Board of Directors immediately ordered an exter-
nal investigation by help of the lawfirm Mannheimer
Swartling. The findings, presented on February 1, this
year, showed no evidence to support the allegations of
criminal activity. On the other hand, the company was
criticized for the way in which the investments had been
made.

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2012

> Introduction

In a statement made on presentation of the report, the
Board of Directors agreed with the conclusions.

The Office of the Prosecutor General at Sweden’s
National Anti-Corruption Unit initiated a preliminary
investigation in September that is still in progress.

The task of living up to the expectations the outside
world places on us is not something that an organiza-
tion such as TeliaSonera can complete at a stroke. It is
acontinuously ongoing process. A series of measures
to bolster our work on sustainability have been ongoing
during the last years.

For example, we have developed our processes and
tightened our risk assessment procedures in connec-
tion with new investments. We have also included sus-
tainability risks into our decision-making procedures.
Counterparty risks and frameworks for evaluation are
analyzed both by ourselves and by qualified independ-
ent experts.

In association with other leading international
telecom companies, we have drafted principles lay-
ing down how we can respect the right to freedom of
expression and integrity. By working together, and with
the Global Network Initiative (GNI), we will be better
able to safeguard fundamental rights.

We have also, with the support of the Danish Institute
for Human rights (DIHR), analyzed which areas we
need to improve in, if we are to live up to the UN Decla-
ration on Human Rights.

In 2013, we will maintain a close focus on sustain-

“We have a lot to be proud of. Despite an
uncertain and troubling macroeconomic
climate, last year we succeded in achiev-

ing our second best result in the ten years
that have elapsed since Telia and Sonera
merged.”

ability issues. In January, we adopted environmental
targets for the whole group for the first time. Our ambi-
tion is, by no later than 2020, to cut our carbon dioxide
emissions and our energy consumption by 20 percent
per subscription from current levels. In February, we
signed up to The Global Compact, which embraces the
UN’s Principles on Human Rights, Labor Law and the
Environment etc.

Issues relating to sustainability, business ethics and
responsibility will be a natural part of everything we do.
The knowledge and experience we have now acquired
at great cost will further sharpen our focus on a sus-
tainable and ethical approach to business throughout
the organization.

We are proud to be driving development of the com-
munication society in a way that will enable even more
people to communicate with each other.

Services, TeliaSonera Holding and Corporate functions,
which are all reported collectively. TeliaSonera’s corpo-
rate functions are Communications, Finance (including
M8A and Procurement), Human Resources, IT, Legal
Affairs and Internal Audit.

In this Report, comparative figures are provided in
parentheses following the operational and financial re-
sults and refer to the same item in the full year of 2011,
unless otherwise stated.

Mission, Vision and Strategy

Vision and strategy - Making it possible
Customers value the freedom and flexibility to do more and get
closer via the internet. TeliaSonera provides network access and

telecommunication services that enable people and businesses
to achieve what's important to them. Seeing the big picture is
important, but the little details are just as essential in meeting
customers’ needs.

Mission — to provide network access and
telecommunication services

TeliaSonera’s mission is to help people and companies
communicate in an easy, efficient and environmen-
tally friendly way, by providing network access and
telecommunication services. Our focus is to deliver a
world-class customer experience, while ensuring the
quality of our networks and maintaining a cost efficient
structure. TeliaSonera is an international group with a
global strategy, but wherever we operate we act as a
local company.

Our focus areas

+ Providing world-class customer experience
+ High quality networks

+ Driving cost efficiency

Vision — to contribute to a world with better
opportunities

TeliaSonera is a world-class service company, recog-
nized as an industry leader. We are proud pioneers of
the telecom industry, a position we have gained by be-
ing innovative, reliable and customer friendly. Wherever
we operate, we act in a responsible way, based ona
firm set of values and business principles. Our services
form a major part of people’s daily lives — for business,
education and pleasure.

Shared values

+ Add value

+ Show respect

+ Make it happen

Strategy — a world-class customer experience
Today communication services are an integral part of
people’s daily lives. Since the arrival of smartphones
and tablets, we rely increasingly on digital communica-
tion for social and business interaction. A trend which
will only grow stronger in the coming years. Communi-
cation services have moved from being expensive and
exclusive to being available, affordable and personal.
Our ambition is to translate our strategy to provide a
world-class customer experience, industry leading net-
work quality and to have a competitive cost structure.

We believe that our industry is faced with three main

challenges:

1.Introducing new business models to rebalance pric-
ing towards data

2.Fixed-mobile convergence and bundling of services

3.Development of value-added services linked to the
core business

Rising to the challenges

We are leading the move towards pricing that better
reflects how customers use their devices. Convergence
is a growing part of our offering, for example giving
customers access to their subscribed TV channels via
computers and mobile devices, bringing video services
such as HBO and Netflix to mobile devices, and inte-
grating Spotify into mobile and TV services.

While maintaining our primary role as an enabler and
access provider, we create added value for private and
business customers through services such as cloud
storage and virtual meetings. The focus here is on ap-
plications closely linked to network access, and that
reduce churn and increase data traffic in our networks.

Data traffic per customer is increasing

Our strategy is based on growth in data traffic beyond

what would be expected from new customers coming

into the network, and an unlimited demand for band-
width. This has two major consequences:

+ Established fixed networks remain competitive, with
strong growth in new services such as IPTV and
video-on-demand

+ The pricing model will evolve. We will move from a
voice-based model to a focus on charging for ac-
cess, usage and speed


--- Page 10 ---

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2012

> Board of Directors’ Report

Our promise

We want our networks and services to be firmly based on cus-

tomer needs. This is our promise to customers:

+ High quality networks, ensuring our services are reliable in
terms of coverage, speed and up-time

+ Aworld-class experience, with services that look and feel
great and are easy to use

+ Abusiness-to-business product portfolio that gives custom-
ers competitive advantage

+ Early implementation of new technology and services

+ Efficient operations with the benefits of economies of scale

Risks and Risk Management

TeliaSonera operates in several geographic markets
and with a broad range of products and services in the
highly competitive and regulated telecommunications
industry. In addition, certain TeliaSonera markets are
highly challenging when it comes to corruption and
violations of human rights. As a result, TeliaSonera is
subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Telia-
Sonera has defined risk as anything that could have a
material adverse effect on the achievement of TeliaSon-
era’s goals. Risks can be threats, uncertainties or lost
opportunities relating to TeliaSonera’s current or future
operations or activities.

TeliaSonera has an established risk management
framework in place to regularly identify, analyze, as-
sess, and report business, financial and sustainability
risks and uncertainties, and to mitigate such risks when
appropriate. Risk management is an integral part of
TeliaSonera’s business planning process and monitor-
ing of business performance. Main risks relate to in-
dustry and market conditions, operations and strategic
activities, associated companies and joint ventures,
sustainability, ownership of TeliaSonera shares, finan-
cial management and financial reporting.

Risks and uncertainties related to business, sustain-
ability and shareholder issues are described in Note
C35, key sources of estimation uncertainty in Note
C2 and financial risks in Note C27 to the consolidated
financial statements. TeliaSonera’s enterprise risk
management, governance and process as well as inter-
nal controls over financial reporting are described in
the Corporate Governance Statement.

Sustainability reporting
TeliaSonera annually reports its sustainability performance
in the Sustainability Report. As of 2012, the external auditors
submitted a review report on the Sustainability Report. Telia-
Sonera applies the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines for
reporting on sustainability including the telecommunications
sector supplement pilot. The report is intended to respond
to internal and external stakeholders’ interest for informa-
tion and request for increased transparency regarding the
sustainability work. Internally, TeliaSonera uses the Sustain-
ability Report to collect, highlight and share information
about best practices across the group. The TeliaSonera
Sustainability Report is available at:

Significant events

In February, the first 4G smartphone from Samsung

was launched. TeliaSonera currently has more than

400,000 4G dongle and smartphone users in the Nor-

dic and Baltic countries. TeliaSonera estimates that in

five years an average smartphone user will use more
than 3 Gigabyte of data monthly, compared to around

0.5 Gigabyte today.

In June, TeliaSonera launched the first commercial
4G services in Azerbaijan and in November TeliaSonera
launched the first commercial 4G services in Moldova.
TeliaSonera was the first operator in the world to com-
mercially launch 4G in 2009 and currently offers 4G
services in 9 countries; Sweden, Finland, Norway,
Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Azerbaijan and
Moldova. TeliaSonera has also made 4G live connec-
tions in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and continues to
roll out superfast mobile internet everywhere, to the

In July, TeliaSonera announced that it had engaged
the Danish Institute for Human Rights to support and
review its human rights impact assessment. Together,
DIHR and TeliaSonera developed a tool tailored to Telia-
Sonera and the human rights risk profile of the telecom
sector. It includes freedom of expression and privacy
issues and is benchmarked on the United Nations’
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
DIHR will also assess TeliaSonera’s consequential miti-
gation plan in 2013. Other ongoing sustainability activi-
ties initiated in 2012 included, but were not limited to:

+ TeliaSonera, a founding member of the ‘Industry Dia-
logue’, counting eleven leading telecom companies,
active participant in defining common principles for
respecting privacy and freedom of expression; and

+ Strengthening of anti-corruption processes and sup-
ply chain management.

In September, TeliaSonera confirmed that the Swedish

Prosecuting Authorities had initiated an investigation

regarding TeliaSonera’s investments in Uzbekistan

and, in October, TeliaSonera assigned Mannheimer

Swartling, one of Sweden’s most respected law firms,

to lead an external review of these investments. Telia-

Sonera’s net exposure in Uzbekistan is approximately

SEK 6 billion. Mannheimer Swartling presented its

review report on February 1, 2013 (see section “Signifi-

cant Events after Year-End 2012”).

In the third quarter of 2012, TeliaSonera announced its
intention to fundamentally change the business by sim-
plifying the way of working. These efficiency measures,
including personnel reductions net of 2,000 employ-
ees, will lower the cost base by SEK 2 billion net over
the coming two years.

In November, the Swedish Parliament decided ona
reduction of the corporate income tax in Sweden from
26.3 percent to 22.0 percent, which will have a positive
effect on TeliaSonera’s overall tax position. A one-time
SEK 1,225 million net release of deferred tax liabilities
was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the
group’s effective tax rate going forward will be reduced
by approximately 1.5 percentage points to around 20
percent, based on current earnings distribution.

In November, Telia in Sweden was the first Nordic
operator to include HBO in its TV offering. This means
that Telia’s close to 600,000 TV customers can watch
new episodes of HBO’s series, subtitled in Swedish,
one day after world premiere. The service also includes
all past seasons of classic HBO series and a selection
of library movies and is available on multiple devices,
on TV, also in HD quality, as well as computers, smart-
phones and tablets. In late December, the HBO service
was also launched in Finland. The goal is to extend the
offering also to Norway and Denmark.

In 2012, some notable business area milestones
were reached:

+ Mobility Services passed the 20 million subscription
mark in the third quarter;

+ Broadband Services’ revenues from IP services
surpassed revenues from traditional services during
the year; and

+ Eurasia passed the 40 million subscription mark in
the third quarter.

In 2012, TeliaSonera made a number of targeted acqui-

sitions and divestitures (see section “Acquisitions and

Divestitures” for further information).

In 2012, TeliaSonera in line with its funding strategy
of diversification and increasing the duration of the debt
portfolio issued a number of bonds under its existing
EUR 11 billion EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) pro-
gram:

+ In February, a 12-year Eurobond of EUR 750 million
with a coupon at 3.625 percent;

+ In August, a 15-year Eurobond of EUR 500 million
with a coupon at 3.000 percent; and

+ In December, a 30-year Benchmark bond in the
Sterling market of GBP 400 million with a coupon at
4.375 percent.

In 2012, the following changes in TeliaSonera Group

Management were made:

+ In April, Robert Andersson was appointed President

and Chief Executive Officer of Sonera in Finland and

member of TeliaSonera Group Management; and

In September, Tero Kivisaari was appointed President

of business area Mobility Services. In addition, he

continued his position as President of business area

Eurasia until February 6, 2013 (see section “Signifi-

cant Events after Year-End 2012”).

Net sales increased 0.1 percent to SEK 104,898 million
(104,804). Net sales in local currencies and excluding
acquisitions increased 1.2 percent (2.6). The negative
effect of exchange rate fluctuations was 1.1 percent
(4.2). Growth was driven by continuing positive devel-
opment in Eurasia, while other positive contributions
from Nordic and Baltic mobile equipment sales, Yoigo
in Spain and the international carrier operations did not
compensate for the slow-down in other areas.

Over the year, the net sales growth rate, in local cur-

The addressable cost base, in local currencies and ex-
cluding acquisitions, decreased 0.3 percent compared
to last year, with increases in Eurasia offset mainly by
decreases in Mobility Services, but to some extent also
by decreases in Broadband Services and Corporate
functions.

Personnel expenses, in local currencies and exclud-
ing acquisitions, increased 0.3 percent compared to
2011. Despite increases in both Broadband Services
and Mobility Services, the decrease in Corporate func-
tions kept the overall level flattish with small increases
in Eurasia.

Marketing expenses, in local currencies and exclud-
ing acquisitions, declined 8.4 percent, with the key
driver being reduced equipment subsidies in Mobility
Services. Other costs, such as facility costs, IT, travel
and consultants, increased.

Amortization, depreciation and impairment losses
increased 54.9 percent to SEK 20,542 million (13,263),
where 2012 included goodwill impairment charges of
SEK 7,534 million related to Mobility Services’ opera-
tions in Norway and Lithuania, and Broadband Ser-
vices’ operations in Norway. Amortization and depre-
ciation excluding non-recurring items decreased 1.7
percent to SEK 12,977 million (13, 197). In local curren-
cies and excluding acquisitions, the decrease was 0.6
percent.

Other operating income and expenses, net, was
negative at SEK 675 million (positive 774).

Non-recurring items

Non-recurring items affecting operating income totaled
SEK -282 million (- 170), mainly related to the sale

of shares in MegaFon which resulted in a net capital
gain of SEK 8,391 million and to goodwill impairment
charges in Mobility Services Norway and Lithuania of
SEK -5,984 million and in Broadband Services Norway
of SEK -1,550 million. Restructuring charges, mainly
related to staff redundancy costs, amounted to SEK
-917 million (-934).

Earnings

EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, decreased 3.1
percent to SEK 36,059 million (37,222). The decrease
in local currencies and excluding acquisitions was 2.4
percent. The main reasons were loss of high-margin
service revenue in Mobility Services and net sales
volume decrease in Broadband Services, partly offset
by the net sales increase in Eurasia. The EBITDA margin
declined to 34.4 percent (35.5).

Operating income, excluding non-recurring items,
decreased 4.4 percent to SEK 28,570 million (29,889)
mainly due to the EBITDA drop and lower income from
associated companies which, excluding non-recurring
items, decreased 6.4 percent to SEK 5,488 million
(5,864). Income from associates was negatively im-
pacted by currency fluctuations, while higher underly-
ing results from operations in Turkcell compensated for
the negative effects of a changed capital structure and
lower effective ownership in MegaFon. The operating
margin, excluding non-recurring items, decreased to
27.2 percent (28.5).

Financial net, taxes and non-controlling interests
Financial items totaled SEK -3,806 million (-2,848). Net
interest expenses increased to SEK -3,069 million
(-2,419) due to higher average indebtedness. Financial
items were also negatively impacted by exchange rate
effects related to the operations in Eurasia.

Income taxes decreased to SEK 3,314 million
(5,753). The effective tax rate was 13.6 percent (21.4).
Following the Swedish Parliament decision in Novem-
ber 2012 to reduce the corporate income tax in Sweden
from 26.3 percent to 22.0 percent, a one-time SEK
1,225 million net release of deferred tax liabilities was
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012. The effective
tax rate going forward is expected to be around 20
percent.

Mainly as a result of increased shareholdings in Kcell
in Kazakhstan and TEO LT in Lithuania during the year,
net income attributable to non-controlling interests in
subsidiaries decreased to SEK 1,282 million (2,731)
of which SEK 1,042 million (2,420) was related to the
operations in Eurasia and SEK 197 million (262) to LMT
and TEO.

in network capacity, coverage and modernization, and
increased investments in fiber roll-out, while invest-
ments in telecom and frequency licenses declined
significantly. CAPEX, excluding license and spectrum
fees, amounted to SEK 15,333 million (14,701) and the

billion. Additional goodwill from business combinations
was SEK 1.2 billion. Other intangible assets decreased
by SEK 1.0 billion to SEK 14.1 billion. Capital expen-
ditures (CAPEX) in other intangible assets were SEK
2.2 billion and amortization SEK 2.7 billion. Currency
effects impacted negatively by SEK 0.5 billion.

Property, plant and equipment increased by SEK
1.4 billion through CAPEX of SEK 13.5 billion and
decreased due to negative exchange rate differences
of SEK 2.1 billion. Depreciation and impairment losses
were SEK 10.3 billion.

Financial assets comprise investments in associated
companies, deferred tax assets and other non-current
assets. The carrying value of associated companies
decreased to SEK 29.4 billion (46.3). Mainly as a result
of the transactions related to OAO MegaFon in Russia,
the value declined by dividends received, in total SEK
12.5 billion, and through the effects of lower effective
shareholdings, totaling SEK 10.7 billion, partly offset by
income from the companies of SEK 5.8 billion. Currency
effects had a limited positive impact of SEK 0.4 billion.

Deferred tax assets decreased from utilization of tax
losses and deferred tax liabilities (included in Provi-
sions) declined as a result of the transactions related
to MegaFon. The enacted Swedish corporate income
tax rate cut as of 2013 resulted in a one-off net release
of deferred tax liabilities of SEK 1.2 billion. Allin all,
the net deferred tax liability of SEK 5.3 billion in 2011
decreased to SEK 4.0 billion at year-end 2012.

Other non-current assets include a SEK 5,675 mil-
lion (0) receivable on AF Telecom, representing the
not yet paid consideration for the sale of shares in the
associated company OAO Telecominvest in Russia. The
current portion of the not yet paid consideration was
SEK 1,884 million (0).

Net working capital (inventories and non-interest-
bearing receivables, less non-interest-bearing liabilities
and excluding foreign exchange rate derivatives and
accrued interest) was SEK 0.1 billion (-0.2).

Total equity declined 7.8 percent to SEK 113.4 billion
(122.9). Shareholders’ equity decreased to SEK 109.4
billion (115.6), positively impacted by net income of
SEK 19.9 billion (18.3) and negatively by dividends of
SEK 12.3 billion (12.3), the effects of transactions with
other owners in subsidiaries and associated companies
totaling SEK 11.0 billion (0) and negative exchange rate
differences of SEK 2.6 billion (5.2). Equity attributable
to non-controlling interests decreased to SEK 4.0 bil-
lion (7.4), impacted by the effects of increased share-
holdings in Kcell in Kazakhstan and TEO LT in Lithuania.
Dividends to non-controlling interests were SEK 3.1
billion (2.0).

Total gross borrowings increased, with a shift towards
long-term borrowings totaling SEK 82.2 billion (68.1).
Short-term borrowings were SEK 9.4 billion (11.7). Posi-
tively impacted by proceeds from the MegaFon-related
transactions, cash and cash equivalents more than
doubled, ending at SEK 29.8 billion. As a result, net debt
decreased from SEK 65.0 billion to SEK 59.4 billion.

related notes to the consolidated financial statements
for further details.

Pension obligations

As of 2013, TeliaSonera’s accounting for pension
obligations will change following the implementation of
certain IFRS amendments (IAS 19). Among a number of
changes impacting TeliaSonera, the most significant is
the elimination of the “corridor approach.” As a result,
historical accumulated actuarial gains and losses will
increase recognized pension liabilities and decrease
shareholders’ equity. Future re-measurements (includ-
ing actuarial gains and losses) will not be deferred, but
immediately impact shareholders’ equity through other
comprehensive income (OCI). Further, the expected
return on plan assets affecting net income should not be
assessed separately, but equal the rate used to discount
pension obligations. As of 2013, TeliaSonera has chosen
to classify these interest components as financial items
in the statement of comprehensive income. In summary,
the estimated impact of applying the provisions of the
revised IAS 19 already in 2012 was as follows.

Credit facilities

TeliaSonera believes that its bank credit facilities and
open-market financing programs are sufficient for the
present liquidity requirements. At year-end, Telia-
Sonera’s surplus liquidity (short-term investments

and cash and bank) totaled SEK 30.0 billion (12.7). In
addition, the total available unutilized amount under
committed bank credit facilities as well as overdraft and
short-term credit facilities at year-end was SEK 11.3
billion (17.7).

TeliaSonera retained its good credit ratings. In the
spring, Moody’s Investors Service changed the outlook
from negative back to stable for its credit rating on
TeliaSonera AB of A3 for long-term borrowings and
Prime-2 for short-term borrowings. Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services confirmed its rating of A- for long-
term borrowings and A2 for short-term borrowings,
with a stable outlook.

DEBT PORTFOLIO MATURITY SCHEDULE - 2013 AND ONWARDS

TeliaSonera generally seeks to arrange its financ-
ing through the parent company TeliaSonera AB. The
primary means of external borrowing are described in
Notes C21 and C27 to the consolidated financial state-
ments. In 2012, TeliaSonera AB issued some SEK 19.9
billion equivalent in the debt capital markets under its
EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) program. Most of the
new funding was denominated in EUR and GBP and
most of it was issued on a long-term basis. At year-end,
the average time to maturity of TeliaSonera AB’s overall
debt portfolio was approximately 7.9 years.

At the end of 2012, TeliaSonera AB had no Commer-
cial Papers outstanding.

Cash flow

Transactions related to the associated company OAO
MegaFon contributed to a more than doubled free cash

dividends from associated companies increasing to
SEK 12.5 billion (0.1), of which MegaFon contributing
SEK 11.7 billion net of taxes (0). Lower cash inflow from
underlying operations was compensated for mainly by
lower tax payments and a positive impact from changes
in working capital. However, cash flow from changes in
working capital remained negative at SEK -1.2 billion
(-1.8).

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2012

> Board of Directors’ Report

Cash CAPEX (cash used in capital expenditures)
decreased by SEK 2.4 billion or 13.7 percent, primar-
ily due to lower investments in telecom and frequency
licenses. As a result, free cash flow (cash flow from
operating activities less capital expenditures) increased
to a total of SEK 23.7 billion (9.4).

Cash flow from other investing activities, total-
ing SEK 8.8 billion (1.6), consists of acquisitions and
divestments, changes in loans receivable and in short
term investments, and repayments from or additional
contributions to pension funds. The improvement in
2012 was mainly due to the MegaFon-related transac-
tions, generating proceeds totaling SEK 9.2 billion from
the divestment of the shares in OAO Telecominvest
in April and from the reduction in ownership to 25.2
percent (35.6) in the November IPO. Cash paid for ac-
quisitions was SEK 0.6 billion (0.3), and net cash used
for granting loans was SEK 0.2 billion (0.5).

Cash outflow from financing activities in 2012, total-
ing SEK 15.2 billion (13.3), included dividends paid to
shareholders of the parent company of SEK 12.3 billion
(12.3) and to non-controlling interests of SEK 3.9 bil-
lion (2.5). Transactions with non-controlling interests
in 2012 resulted in a net outflow of SEK 8.8 billion, of
which the transactions related to Kcell in Kazakhstan,
i.e. acquisition of 49 percent in January and divestment
of 25 percent in the December IPO, and to TEO LT in
Lithuania net totaled SEK 7.9 billion. Net inflow from
new borrowings was SEK 11.9 billion (12.5). In 2011,
payment for repurchased treasury shares had a nega-
tive impact of SEK 10.0 billion.

See Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and
related notes to the consolidated financial statements
for further details.

Outlook for 2013

The growth in net sales in local currencies and exclud-
ing acquisitions is expected to be flat. Currency fluctua-
tions may have a material impact on reported figures in
Swedish krona.

The EBITDA margin, excluding non-recurring items,
is expected to increase slightly compared to last year
(2012: 34.4 percent).

The CAPEX-to-sales ratio is expected to be approxi-
mately 14 percent, excluding license and spectrum
fees (2012: 14.6 percent).

Efficiency Measures

As announced in the third quarter of 2012, efficiency
measures including personnel reductions net of 2,000
employees, will lower the cost base by SEK 2 billion net
over the coming two years, of which approximately SEK
0.2 billion was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012.

In 2013, the addressable cost base, excluding
Mobility Services Spain, is expected to be reduced
to SEK 26.3 billion in local currencies and excluding
acquisitions (addressable cost base excluding Mobility
Services Spain 2012: SEK 27.1 billion). In 2014, it will be
lowered to SEK 25.3 billion.

During 2013, 1,800 employees in the Nordics and
Baltics will be effected (total number of employees
2012: 27,838 of which 22,537 in the Nordics and
Baltics). These efficiency measures will be completed
by early 2014 at the latest. Total cost for these reduc-
tions in 2013 is estimated to SEK 1.7 billion. At the same
time, TeliaSonera sees a need to recruit new compe-
tence.

Ordinary Dividend to Shareholders

For 2012, the Board of Directors proposes to the An-
nual General Meeting (AGM) an ordinary dividend of
SEK 2.85 (2.85) per share, totaling SEK 12,341 million
(12,341), or 62 percent (68) of net income attributable
to owners of the parent company.

* Pay-out ratio for 2012 according to the Board of Directors’ dividend proposal

According to its dividend policy, TeliaSonera shall target
a solid investment grade long-term credit rating (A- to
BBB+) to secure the company’s strategically important
financial flexibility for investments in future growth, both
organically and by acquisitions. The ordinary dividend
shall be at least 50 percent of net income attribut-

able to owners of the parent company. In addition,

excess capital shall be returned to shareholders after

the Board of Directors has taken into consideration

Chapter 18 Section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act, to

assess whether the proposed dividend is justified. The

Board of Directors assesses that:

+ The parent company’s restricted equity and the
group’s total equity attributable to the shareholders
of the parent company, after the distribution of profits
in accordance with the proposal, will be sufficient in
relation to the scope of the parent company’s and the
group’s business.

+ The proposed dividend does not jeopardize the
parent company’s or the group’s ability to make
the investments that are considered necessary. The
proposal is consistent with the established cash flow
forecast under which the parent company and the
group are expected to manage unexpected events
and temporary variations in cash flows to a reason-
able extent.

The full statement by the Board of Directors on the
same will be included in the AGM documents. See also

Proposal for Share Repurchase
Authorization

In order to provide TeliaSonera with an additional in-
strument to adjust the company’s capital structure, the
Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General
Meeting resolve to authorize the Board of Directors to
repurchase a maximum of 10 percent of the company’s
total number of outstanding shares, with the intention
of cancelling repurchased shares.

TeliaSonera Share

The TeliaSonera share is listed on NASDAQ OMX Stock-
holm and Helsinki. In 2012, the share price in Stock-
holm declined 5.8 percent, to SEK 44.06. During the
same period, the OMX Stockholm 30 Index rose 11.8
percent and the STOXX 600 Telecommunications Index
declined 10.7 percent.

At year-end 2012, TeliaSonera’s market capitaliza-
tion was SEK 190.8 billion. Besides NASDAQ OMX
Stockholm and Helsinki, the share was traded at other
platforms with the major trading volumes at BATS Chi-X
CXE and Boat xoff.

Holdings outside Sweden and Finland increased
from 18.2 percent to 22.4 percent and TeliaSonera had
553,631 shareholders at the end of the year, of which
two shareholders held more than 10 percent of the

As of December 31, 2012, TeliaSonera’s issued and
outstanding share capital totaled SEK 13,856,271,299
distributed among 4,330,084,781 shares. All issued
shares have been paid in full and carry equal rights to
vote and participate in the assets of the company. At
the general meeting of shareholders, each shareholder
is entitled to vote for the total number of shares she or
he owns or represents. Each share is entitled to one
vote. TeliaSonera holds no own shares. As of Decem-
ber 31, 2012, TeliaSonera’s Finnish pension fund held
0.01 percent of the company’s shares and votes.

There are no provisions in either the Swedish leg-
islation or in TeliaSonera AB’s Articles of Association
that would limit the possibility to transfer TeliaSonera
shares. TeliaSonera is not aware of any agreements
between major shareholders of the company regarding
the TeliaSonera shares.

The Board of Directors does not currently have any
authorization by the general meeting of shareholders to
issue new shares but has the authorization to repur-
chase a maximum of 10 percent of the company’s total
number of outstanding shares.

In case of a change of control in TeliaSonera AB, the
company could have to repay certain loans at short
notice, since some of TeliaSonera’s financing agree-
ments contain customary change-of-control clauses.

21

These clauses generally also contain other conditions

including, for example, that the change of control has

to cause a negative change in TeliaSonera’s credit rat-
ing in order to be effective.

Business Area Development in 2012

Market development

The year was characterized by a continuous increase in
data traffic. Customer demand for bandwidth appears
to be unlimited. At the same time, the willingness to pay
for voice traffic is decreasing and the whole industry

is struggling with the challenge to capitalize from the
increase in data traffic to compensate for lost voice
revenue. During the year, 4G was established as one

of the key enablers to allow data growth to continue


--- Page 20 ---

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2012

> Board of Directors’ Report

while maintaining a pleasant customer experience with
sufficient data speed. Price wars occurred in several
markets during the year, putting pressure on margins.

After the successful launch of 4G tablets before
Christmas 2011, the first 4G smartphone from Sam-
sung was launched in February 2012. At the end of the
year, in Sweden, 4G handsets represented around 10
percent of all handsets sold.

In the second quarter of 2012, TT-Netveerket, the
network-sharing joint venture with Telenor was estab-
lished in Denmark and secured 800 MHz frequencies
which will allow further roll-out of the 4G network.

Net sales

Interconni
Bal inbound roamin
wholesale revenu

Net sales in local currencies and excluding acquisi-
tions were unchanged. In reported currency, net sales
decreased 1.8 percent to SEK 50,637 million (51,556).
The negative effect of exchange rate fluctuations was
1.9 percent. The number of subscriptions increased 5.2
percent and passed 20 million while prices generally
declined, leaving billed revenues more or less flat (+0.5
percent). Also interconnect rate reductions contributed
to the net sales decrease.

Only the operations in Sweden and Spain grew
during the year. In Sweden, growth came from both
service revenues and equipment sales. Data volume
conversion to revenues was in decline during the year
but stabilized towards the end of the year.

Strong net intake of 668,000 subscriptions, an
increase in the subscriber base of 22.0 percent, gener-
ated growth in Spain. Market conditions in Denmark
continued to be challenging and although the sub-
scriber base increased, an ARPU decline caused falling
net sales.

Earnings

EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, decreased
7.4 percent in local currencies and excluding acquisi-
tions. In reported currency, EBITDA, excluding non-
recurring items, declined 8.5 percent to SEK 14,689
million (16,053). The EBITDA margin decreased to 29.0
percent (31.1).

The EBITDA decline was strongest in Finland and
Norway, where both markets saw falling service
revenue volumes. In Finland, the service margin was
strengthened whereas in Norway, also the service mar-

22

gin declined however compensated for by decreasing
addressable costs. Spain continued to improve both
gross margin and EBITDA. Denmark had a challenging
year with net sales losses which was compensated for
by improved equipment margins and reduced ad-
dressable costs, but still the EBITDA development was
negative.

Operating income, excluding non-recurring items,
declined to SEK 10,400 million (11,322), mainly due to
the negative EBITDA development. Amortization and
depreciation was lower than previous year in Norway
and the Baltic countries, as investment levels were
adjusted to the deteriorating market conditions.

Non-recurring items amounted to SEK -6,200 mil-
lion (-200), primarily comprising goodwill impairment
charges in the Norwegian operations related to the
substantial goodwill amount originating from the acqui:
sition of NetCom ASA in 2000, and the current assess-
ment of the achievable long-term return on investment.
Towards the end of the year, non-recurring charges
related to the cost savings program increased.

CAPEX

CAPEX decreased to SEK 4,496 million (6,742) and
the CAPEX-to-sales ratio to 8.9 percent (13.1). CAPEX,
excluding licenses and spectrum fees, amounted to
SEK 4,397 million (4,468) and the CAPEX-to-sales
was flat at 8.7 percent (8.7). Cash flow, measured as
EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, minus CAPEX,
increased to SEK 10,193 million (9,311).

Market development

Customers continue to move from traditional to IP-
based services and during the year, revenues from IP
services surpassed traditional revenues. In Sweden,
TV ARPU (average revenue per user) and broadband
ARPU increased more than 5 percent in 2012.

In August, TeliaSonera and Samsung launched a
Smart TV solution, unique in terms of easy to use and
customer friendly, as it does not require any external
set-top-box. The Smart TV solution was launched in
Estonia in late 2012 and will be launched in Sweden and
Finland during 2013. In 2012, TeliaSonera also signed
an agreement with HBO Nordic enabling TeliaSonera’s
TV customers to see a number of the world’s best TV
series the day after the US premiere of each episode.
At year-end, half of TeliaSonera’s Swedish consumer
broadband customers were also using the TV service.

TeliaSonera continues to invest in fiber network roll-
out, and during the year almost 200,000 new homes
were connected to the fiber network. In Sweden, four
out of ten single-dwelling households being offered
TeliaSonera’s services sign up for them. Roll-out will be
selective to ensure a good return on investment. By the
end of 2014, TeliaSonera aims to expand the coverage
by fiber to 2.3 million connected homes in the Nordic
and Baltic countries, of which almost 1 million in Swe-
den. Currently, the average TeliaSonera fiber customer
in Sweden uses two services.

In December, TeliaSonera decided that its subsidiary
in Norway, NextGenTel, did not constitute the appropri-
ate platform to compete successfully in the Norwegian
broadband market and that other parts of the business
would be prioritized. As a result of the divestment,
TeliaSonera recognized a goodwill write-down of SEK
1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Net sales

Net sales in local currencies and excluding acquisitions
decreased 1.7 percent. In reported currency, net sales
decreased 2.6 percent to SEK 35,723 million (36,677).
The negative effect of exchange rate fluctuations was
1.1 percent and the positive effect of acquisitions and
disposals was 0.2 percent.

The number of broadband subscriptions rose above
2.5 million, an increase of 51,000 during the year. The
change in mix from traditional services to IP based
services results in both net sales and margin pressure.
Sweden and Finland stand for the largest part of the
decline. The number of TV subscriptions increased by
155,000 to 1.3 million, of which 0.6 million in Sweden.
Total fixed-voice subscriptions decreased by 673,000
to 3.6 million, offset by an increase of VoIP subscrip-
tions of 137,000, to 0.7 million.

Earnings

EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, decreased
7.8 percent in local currencies and excluding acquisi-
tions. In reported currency, EBITDA, excluding non-
recurring items, declined 8.4 percent to SEK 10,953
million (11,961). The EBITDA margin decreased to 30.7
percent (32.6).

The EBITDA decline was strongest in Sweden, down
by 8.9 percent, as the net sales and gross margin
decrease following the unfavorable product mix shift
could not be met by lower addressable costs. In local
currency excluding acquisitions, Norway, Denmark,
Lithuania and International Carrier managed to improve
EBITDA. Finland lost 14.3 percent of the 2011 EBITDA
as a consequence of both lower net sales and lower
gross margins.

Operating income decreased to SEK 4,003 million
(6,582). A large part of the decline was caused by the
write-down of goodwill related to NextGenTel. Operat-
ing income, excluding non-recurring items, was SEK
6,191 million (7,168), in line with the EBITDA decline.
Due to the fiber investments, amortization and depre-
ciation was slightly higher than previous year.

CAPEX

CAPEX increased to SEK 5,445 million (5,263) and the
CAPEX-to-sales ratio increased to 15.2 percent (14.3).
About SEK 1.7 billion was spent on fiber investments.
Cash flow, measured as EBITDA, excluding non-re-

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2012

> Board of Directors’ Report

Market development
The number of subscriptions in the consolidated opera-
tions reached 40 million during the third quarter 2012.
All markets grew in local currencies.

In order to meet the increasing demand for mo-
bile data services in Kazakhstan, TeliaSonera signed
an agreement to acquire valuable frequencies in the
2.5/2.6 GHz band, which are compatible for use with
WiMax and other mobile data transmission technolo-
gies, during the fourth quarter. In addition, TeliaSonera
agreed to make an indirect minority investment in
KazTransCom, a listed company that owns, among
other businesses, a fiber optics network in Kazakhstan.

The market conditions in Uzbekistan changed signifi-
cantly during the second half of the year. The competi-
tor MTS lost its license which caused a massive inflow
of former MTS customers, both to Ucell and to the
other remaining player. It is unclear for how long these
market conditions will be maintained.

As expected, mobile data growth has continued ata
high rate. During the year, data revenues increased 46
percent and data volumes by some 300 percent.

Net sales

Net sales in local currencies and excluding acquisitions
increased 13.5 percent. In reported currency, net sales
increased 13.9 percent to SEK 19,731 million (17,330).
The positive effect of exchange rate fluctuations was
0.4 percent.

In Kazakhstan, the largest market in the business
area, sales increased by 1.8 percent in local currency.
Growth was generated by continued strong increase in
the subscriber base by 2.6 million to 13.5 million and
increased usage. The reduction in average revenue per
user as a result of price pressure on voice and data ser-
vices was compensated for by the increase in subscrip-
tions and a 38 percent growth in minutes of use. The
main three mobile operators in Kazakhstan have agreed
ona 15 percent annual reduction in interconnect prices
for the coming three years.

In Azerbaijan, net sales increased 9.4 percent in
local currency despite relatively small growth in the
customer base as minutes of use increased 36 percent.
Azercell has successfully launched several new offers
to promote and increase mobile data penetration and
data revenues represented 9 percent of total revenues
in the fourth quarter.

In Uzbekistan, the new market situation where the
competitor MTS lost its license resulted in high inflow of
new customers during the second half of the year. Rev-
enue grew 44.1 percent in local currency, as customer
growth was 23 percent and average revenue per user
increased at the same time.

In Nepal, net sales in local currency increased 51.3
percent to the equivalent of SEK 2,716 million (1,916)
as a result of the higher subscription base which in-
creased 32 percent and an increase in average revenue
per user.

Earnings

EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, increased 12.7
percent in local currencies and excluding acquisitions.
In reported currency, EBITDA, excluding non-recurring
items, increased 12.7 percent to SEK 9,976 million
(8,850). The EBITDA margin was 50.6 percent (51.1).
The growth in EBITDA, in local currencies, was mainly
driven by increased net sales in Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan
and Nepal. In Kazakhstan, gross margin was under
pressure due to high interconnect costs. Uzbekistan
and Nepal were negatively impacted by taxes and fees
introduced during the year.

Operating income, excluding non-recurring items,
increased to SEK 12,340 million (11,842). The EBITDA
improvement was offset by increased amortization and
depreciation, mainly in Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan.
Income from associates decreased, mainly due to
lower income from MegaFon as a consequence of the
changed capital structure of the company and cur-
rency effects, in combination with reduced ownership.
Turkcell showed steady improvement.

Non-recurring items totaled SEK 8,289 million (750),
of which SEK 8,391 million related to the MegaFon
transactions during the year.

CAPEX

CAPEX increased to SEK 4,739 million (4,538) and

the CAPEX-to-sales ratio decreased to 24.0 percent
(26.2). CAPEX, excluding licenses and spectrum fees,
was SEK 4,486 million (4,129) and the CAPEX-to-sales
ratio 22.7 percent (23.8). CAPEX was used to improve
capacity and coverage, and particularly to support

the rapid growth in Uzbekistan and Nepal. Cash flow,
measured as EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items,
minus CAPEX, increased to SEK 5,237 million (4,312).

reported currency, net sales decreased to SEK 3,799

Legal and administrative proceedings

In its normal course of business, TeliaSonera is involved
in a number of legal proceedings. These proceedings
primarily involve claims arising out of commercial law
issues and matters relating to telecommunications reg-
ulations and competition law. For further information,
see Note C30 to the consolidated financial statements.

Innovation, Research and Development

Innovation, research and development (R&D) activi-
ties are performed to ensure TeliaSonera’s pioneer-
ing position in the telecom industry as well as support
future profitable growth and cost efficiency. The main
focus is on developing the core network access and
telecommunication service solutions. To support the
core business, value-added services are facilitated in
partnership with leading brands and players to enhance
the offerings to various customer segments.

A key tool for innovation is partnership with external
actors. The possibility to leverage such a partnership by
investing in the partner was re-introduced in 2012 and
two investments were made. The innovation and R&D
activities strive to develop high-quality and innovative
services, products and systems that offer a world-
class user experience. Customer focus, cooperation
with partners and innovation clusters, open standards,
integration of third party solutions, holistic approach
and business models are specifically considered in the
innovation and R&D work.

The key focus for innovation and R&D during 2012
has been world-class network quality in mobile and
fiber, mobile data development, substantially improved
business support systems and to strengthen TeliaSon-
era’s market leadership. OTT (over-the-top) commu-
nication and video solutions in combination with the
ever-growing use of data has increased the attention
on new solutions and business models to rebalance the
revenues from voice to data. The consumer portfo-
lio is developed with new functionality and services
regarding digital home, IPTV, media and applications.
The business portfolio is being further developed with
emphasis on cloud-based services, applications and
net-based communication solutions, where TeliaSon-
era intends to continue to explore opportunities to work
closely with partners. TeliaSonera is also working with
partners to develop the M2M (machine-to-machine)
area to facilitate new useful services.

As of December 31, 2012, TeliaSonera had 446 pat-
ent “families” and 2,628 patents and patent applica-
tions, none of which, individually, is material to its busi-
ness. TeliaSonera has increased the efforts regarding
commercialization of the patent portfolio.

In 2012, TeliaSonera incurred R&D expenses of SEK
385 million (508).

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2012

Environment

TeliaSonera is committed to environmental respon-
sibility. The work is guided by TeliaSonera’s Code of
Ethics and Conduct which serves as an overall policy
document, also covering the majority-owned subsidiar-
ies. Annually, TeliaSonera also publicly reports on its
environmental performance in a separate Sustainability
Report.

‘The TeliaSonera Sustainability Report is available at:
www.teliasonera.com/Sustainability-Report

(Information on the TeliaSonera website does not form
part of this Report)

The environmental impact from TeliaSonera’s opera-
tions is mainly associated with energy utilization and
material usage. Customers demand 24/7 mobile and
internet connectivity and even if using cutting-edge
technology, the energy consumption required to
meet this demand and to run the operations currently
represent the greatest part of TeliaSonera’s calculated
carbon footprint. One permanent priority is to continu-
ously strive to find more energy-efficient solutions for
networks and data centers. With 2012 as the base year,
group common targets are:
+ To reduce carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions by 20 per-
cent per subscription equivalent by 2020; and
+ To increase energy efficiency (measured as kWh
electricity purchased in operations) by 20 percent by

2020.

The progress on the targets will be reported to Group
Management bi-annually.

TeliaSonera’s operations also generate waste of
various kinds, including hazardous waste, electronic
equipment, networks devices and cables, and waste
from office premises. Technology shifts currently
represent a considerable challenge in terms of waste
management, particularly in relation to the handling of
disused poles, which contain hazardous substances,
and to the recycling of valuable copper cables.

TeliaSonera’s indirect environmental impacts include
various ways in which customers can use TeliaSonera’s
services to reduce their CO, emissions. Other indirect
environmental impacts related to TeliaSonera’s value
chain include activities such as the manufacturing of
the equipment and devices used by customers and
TeliaSonera’s own network equipment, as well as the
end-of-life treatment of these products.

Asa minimum, TeliaSonera companies shall comply
with local legal requirements wherever they operate.
TeliaSonera in Sweden does not conduct any opera-
tions subject to environmental permits from authori-
ties according to the Swedish Environmental Code,
Chapter 9.

Remuneration to Executive Management

Proposed remuneration policy for executive
management 2013

The Board of Directors’ proposal for the remuneration
policy for executive management, to be adopted at the
Annual General Meeting on April 3, 2013, is as follows.

Remuneration principles

TeliaSonera’s objective is to offer remuneration levels
and other employment conditions required to attract,
retain and motivate high caliber executives needed to
maintain the success of the business. Remuneration
should be built upon a total reward approach allowing
for a market relevant — but not market leading — and
cost effective executive remuneration based on the fol-
lowing compensation components.

1. Base salary

2. Pension

3. Other benefits

Remuneration structure

Base salary

The base salary should reflect the competence re-
quired in the position and the responsibility, complexity
and the business contribution of the executive. The
base salary should also reflect the performance of the
executive and consequently be individual and differen-
tiated.

Pension
Pension and other retirement benefits should be based
on the defined contribution method.

Other benefits

The termination period may be up to six months when
given by the executive and up to 12 months when given
by the employer (in relation to the CEO six months). In
case of termination given by the employer, the execu-
tive may be entitled to a severance payment of up to 12
months (in relation to the CEO 24 months). The sever-
ance payment shall not constitute a basis for calcula-
tion of vacation pay or pension benefits and shall be
reduced should the executive be entitled to pay from a
new employment or from conducting his own business
during the period under which the severance is payable
to the executive.

The executive may be entitled to a company car
benefit, health care provisions, travel insurance, etc. in
accordance with local labor market practice.

The Board of Directors is allowed to make minor
deviations on an individual basis from the principles
stated above.

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2012

> Board of Directors’ Report

Long-term variable pay program

The Annual General Meeting held on April 3, 2012,
decided to launch a long-term variable pay program
which includes approximately 100 key employees. This
program is not available for the members of Group
Management. A long-term variable pay program should
ensure long-term sustainability of the company, secure
a joint interest in increased shareholder value and
provide an alignment between key employees and the
shareholders by sharing risks and rewards of the Telia-
Sonera share price.

The program rewards performance measured over a
minimum of a three year period, is capped to a maxi-
mum of 37.5 percent of the annual base salary and is
equity based (invested and delivered in TeliaSonera
shares with the ambition that the employees should re-
main shareholders also after vesting). A prerequisite for
payout from such a program is the continuous employ-
ment at the end of the performance period. The pro-
gram measures performance over a 3-year period in
relation to Earnings Per Share (EPS, weight 50 percent)
and Total Shareholder Return (TSR, weight 50 percent)
compared to a corresponding TSR development of a
pre-defined peer-group of companies. The program
may be annually repeated. In 2011, an equal program
was launched for approximately 90 key employees. The
prevalence of a long-term variable pay program is sub-
ject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting. For
more information, see Note C32 to the consolidated
financial statements.

October 2012, presented its review of TeliaSonera’s
investments in Uzbekistan. MSA did not find any
substance to the allegations that TeliaSonera com-
mitted bribery or participated in money laundering
in connection with these investments but directed
serious criticism at TeliaSonera for shortcomings in
the investment process and that the internal controls
were not sufficient.

On the same day, TeliaSonera’s Board of Directors
issued a statement, concluding that the investments
were not carried out in a satisfactory manner and that
the Board concurred with and shared MSA's criti-
cism. The Board also stated that it wants to increase
its efforts in developing principles and processes that
respect human rights and protect the company from
corruption. The goal is to ensure that TeliaSonera’s
anti-corruption efforts attain high standards and
stand up to a stringent international comparison.

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2012

Corporate Governance Statement

Introduction and Compliance

This Corporate Governance Statement has been
adopted by the Board of Directors at its meeting on
March 6, 2013. It presents an overview of TeliaSonera’s
corporate governance model and includes the Board’s
description of the internal control environment and risk
management regarding financial reporting.

The 2012 Corporate Governance Statement has
been prepared according to the Swedish Corporate
Governance Code and the Swedish Annual Reports Act
and has been audited by the external auditors.

Itis the opinion of the Board of Directors that
TeliaSonera has complied with the Swedish Corporate
Governance Code during 2012. However, with respect
to Section 8.1 of the Code, the annual evaluation of
the work of the Board of Directors was performed by
the Nomination Committee and not the Board itself.
Further, there has been no infringement of applicable
stock exchange rules and no breach of good practice
on the securities market reported by the NASDAQ OMX
Stockholm’s Disciplinary Committee or the Swedish
Securities Council.

TeliaSonera’s strategy means that the company
does business in some of the world’s most challeng-
ing markets when it comes to corruption and violations
of human rights. The importance of a zero tolerance
across the entire organization for corruption and
human rights abuses can therefore not be underesti-
mated. In 2012, a large part of the work of the Board
of Directors and Group Management was devoted to
sharpening the focus on these sustainability risk issues
and significant new measures were implemented and
announced.

In addition, development work in corporate govern-
ance during 2012 primarily focused on risk manage-
ment related to IT risks and on improved financial
reporting processes, in particular as regards process
harmonization and cash-flow reporting.

Governance Code is available at:

training session focused on the accounting for financial
and hedging transactions, and transactions related to
mergers and acquisitions. The Committee was also

year period as well as yearly operational and financial
targets.

communicate in an easy, efficient and environmen-
tally friendly way, by providing network access and
telecommunication services. Our focus is to deliver a
world-class customer experience, while ensuring the

35

Strategy — a world class customer experience
Today communication services are an integral part of
people’s daily lives. Since the arrival of smartphones
and tablets, we rely increasingly on digital communica-
tion for social and business interaction. A trend which
will only grow stronger in the coming years. Communi-
cation services have moved from being expensive and
exclusive to being available, affordable and personal.
Our ambition is to translate our strategy to provide a
world-class customer experience, industry leading net-
work quality and to have a competitive cost structure.

Operational and financial targets

Operational and financial targets are set for the group
as a whole and for each business area, business unit
and multi market operations.

Setting the boundaries for how we act

The Board of Directors sets the boundaries on how
the employees shall act. Key elements in setting the
boundaries are shared values, code of ethics and
conduct, group policies, organizational structure and
delegation of obligations and authority.

Shared values — making us stronger together
TeliaSonera’s shared values — “Add value,” “Show re-
spect” and “Make it happen” — shape the way we work
every day.

Add value

We are customer focused and business minded. Inno-
vation and pioneering are important aspects of our her-
itage and culture. By collaborating in teams and across
borders, we share knowledge and use our resources.
efficiently. We take ownership, follow up and give feed-
back to ensure that we foster simple and sustainable
solutions that deliver value for our customers.

Show respect

We demonstrate trust, courage and integrity in every-
thing we do. We place a high value on our employees’
knowledge and diversity, and share the responsibility
for creating a good working climate. We treat others
the way we want to be treated; in a professional and
fair manner. We carefully protect customer privacy and
network integrity, and always act in the best interests of
our customers and our company.

Make it happen

We constantly make decisions to drive development
and change; planning and fast implementation are
crucial to our business. We make the best use of our
employees’ competence and commitment to maintain
a dynamic business climate where everyone contrib-
utes. We make it easy and rewarding to do business
with us, and always deliver on our promises.

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2012

> Corporate Governance Statement

Sustainability

TeliaSonera strives for sustainability throughout the
value chain, and aims to be fully accountable to the
stakeholders. The term sustainability is used as an um-
brella term covering all efforts to realize economic as
well as environmental and social sustainability through
responsible business operations.

TeliaSonera’s sustainability work involves ensuring
environmental and social sustainability along the sup-
ply chain, taking care of the well-being of the employ-
ees, reducing own carbon footprint and those of the
customers, respecting human rights, complying with
ethical business practices in all markets, improving
the protection of customer privacy, protecting children
online, and supporting research related to exposure to
electromagnetic fields.

Managing sustainability opportunities and risks is an
integral part of TeliaSonera’s operations and one of the
main risk areas within the enterprise risk management
framework. Since 2012, compliance with sustainability-
related requirements, as well as sustainability risk man-
agementis a permanent item on the Audit Committee
agenda. TeliaSonera aims to ensure that the sustain-
ability management practices are constantly updated
on present and future issues and developments, and
that the stakeholders can play a proactive role.

Code of ethics and conduct

Sustainability work is guided by the TeliaSonera Code
of Ethics and Conduct, which serves as an overall
policy document. The Code defines how TeliaSonera’s
employees should interact with different stakeholders,
including customers, business partners, competitors,
co-workers, shareholders, governments and regulatory
bodies, as well as local communities wherever Telia-
Sonera operates. The policy document covers all enti-
ties in which TeliaSonera holds more than a 50 percent
ownership and is available in 21 languages.

In order to continue the implementation efforts
which started in 2011 and to further ensure full compli-
ance with the Code, a related e-learning tool has been
created and the roll-out will start in 2013. The training
tool focuses on anti-corruption and human rights.

The TeliaSonera Code of Ethics and Conduct is available at:
www.teliasonera.com/Code-of-Ethics

(Information on the TeliaSonera website does not form part of
this Statement)

Policies on anti-corruption and supply chain conduct
TeliaSonera has a Clear position against corruption, and
prioritizes anti-corruption work. In 2012, TeliaSonera
prepared a new group policy on anti-corruption, which
is due to be finalized by early 2013. In order to further
develop anti-corruption practices, cooperation with
Transparency International was initiated, with the aim of
reaching a best-practice international standard.

To ensure sustainability in the supply chain, the
TeliaSonera Supplier Code defines the conduct ex-
pected from suppliers in relation to protecting human
and labor rights, promoting occupational health and
safety, environmental management and ethical busi-
ness practices. The conduct rules are mandatory to
major suppliers.

The TeliaSonera Supplier Code is available at:
wwww.teliasonera.com/Supplier-Code

(Information on the TeliaSonera website does not form part of
this Statement)

Sustainability reporting

TeliaSonera annually reports its sustainability perfor-
mance in the Sustainability Report. As of 2012, the
external auditors submitted a review report on the
Sustainability Report. TeliaSonera applies the Global
Reporting Initiative guidelines for reporting on sus-
tainability including the telecommunications sector
supplement pilot. The report is intended to respond to
internal and external stakeholders’ interest for informa-
tion and request for increased transparency regarding
the sustainability work. Internally, TeliaSonera uses the
Sustainability Report to collect, highlight and share
information about best practices across the group.

Whistle-blower process

The Board of Directors has established a process which
enables employees to anonymously report violations

in accounting, reporting or internal controls, as well as
non-compliance with the TeliaSonera Code of Ethics
and Conduct, a so called whistle-blower process. The
employees’ whistle-blower tool is based on an intranet
solution.

Sonera’s financial reporting or if you suspect any misconduct

The business area comprises mobile operations in Ka-
zakhstan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Georgia,
Moldova and Nepal. The business area is also respon-
sible for developing TeliaSonera’s shareholdings in
Russian MegaFon and Turkish Turkcell.

Head office functions

The head office functions assist the CEO in setting the
framework for the activities of the business areas and
provide the business areas with process development
support and common platforms within the areas com-
munication, finance (including M&A and procurement),
human resources, IT and legal affairs.

Delegation of obligations and authority

The CEO has issued a delegation of obligations and
authority, which defines the obligations imposed on the
heads of business areas, including the heads of sales
division Business Services and TeliaSonera Finland,
and corporate functions, and within which limits they
may make decisions.

Follow-up of our performance

Performance follow-up is essential in order to be able
to take corrective measures and plan for the future.
Performance follow-up is performed on organizational
units as well as on an individual level.

Business reviews

The CEO sets goals for the operations based on the
decisions of the Board of Directors. To ensure per-
formance, managers have annual targets for their
particular operations. The planning of the business is
documented in annual operating plans and the follow-
up is conducted on a monthly basis, complemented
with forecasts and quarterly business review meetings
on business unit and business area levels. The business
review meetings are held as physical meetings and
include financial and business reviews for the report-
ing period and forecast period, risks and operations
performance metrics on network quality and customer

service levels. At the business area review meetings,
the CEO, CFO, Group Controller and selected mem-
bers of Group Management attend in addition to the
respective business area management.

The Board of Directors receives reports on operation-
al performance on a monthly basis and at each regular
Board meeting, the group’s operational and financial
performance is presented in detail by the CEO and the
CFO. The business area heads also regularly present
their view on the business development to the Board.

Performance management

In order to outperform competition and reach challeng-

ing goals, TeliaSonera is developing a high perfor-

mance company culture. Setting individual objec-

tives linked to strategic business goals and providing

frequent feedback are crucial activities for managers

at all levels. TeliaSonera has established a group-wide

performance management model currently valid for the

five highest management levels in the organization.
The model, which aims to focus on TeliaSonera’s

business objectives and to cascade them into the dif-

ferent business areas, is designed to:

+ Help managers to set and cascade business objec-
tives

+ Review individual performance

+ Develop and reward high performance

+ Address poor performance

In TeliaSonera, performance is not only about what you
achieve but also how you achieve your objectives, i.e.
what kind of competences and behaviors the employee
applies in order to reach results. A group-wide compe-
tency framework is established that outlines successful
leadership competences for different roles and levels.
The framework offers support to leaders when provid-
ing feedback to individuals on performance and on
which competences to develop. In order to establish
shared principles and expectations on competences
and behaviors, TeliaSonera’s shared values are used as
a platform for the evaluation of preferred behaviors.

TeliaSonera’s performance management process is
annual. The year starts with setting objectives and ends
with a performance evaluation. Consequence manage-
ment is applied, which means that high performance is
rewarded and poor performance addressed. Perfor-
mance has a direct impact on compensation as well as
career- and development opportunities.

The Board of Directors’ Remuneration Committee
reviews the individual performance of Group Manage-
ment members on a yearly basis.

Enterprise Risk Management

Integrated risk management and governance

Risk management is an integral part of the group’s
operational activities, business planning process and
monitoring of business performance. Risks that may
pose a threat to achieving business objectives are
identified, and measures are implemented to mitigate
and monitor the identified risks. The aim is not only to
focus on negative risks, but also to acknowledge that
successful risk management is essential for grasping
business opportunities and growth.

The roles and responsibilities for operational risk
management, monitoring and compliance as well as

+ The line organization has the ownership, responsibil-
ity and accountability for assessing, controlling and
mitigating risks

The Risk Management Committee facilitates and
monitors the implementation of effective risk man-
agement practices within the operations as well as
sets the reporting requirements and coordinates
compliance assessments throughout the group

The group internal audit function provides independ-
ent assurance on effective corporate governance,
internal controls and risk management procedures
External parties, such as the external auditors and
regulatory bodies provide assurance in relation to
specific objectives and requirements, e.g. on the
information presented in the consolidated financial
statements or reported to the Swedish Financial
Supervisory Authority

According to the TeliaSonera Risk Management Policy,
all TeliaSonera employees are responsible for acknowl-
edging the risks that are taken as part of the daily work.
Line management is responsible for implementing

risk management in the ordinary line organization. To
support line management, and enable a consistent risk
view throughout the group, the risk management work
has been divided into three function-based risk areas
which are:

+ Business and Finance —- Group CFO

+ Sustainability - Head of Group Communications

+ IT and Security —- Group ClO

The function-based risk areas are responsible for
deciding on how to manage risks, i.e. issuing guide-
lines regarding identification, mitigation, execution and
reporting. The risk areas are also responsible for moni-
toring risks as well as monitoring compliance assess-
ments and reporting to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO).

The CRO is responsible for coordinating and moni-
toring the risk management processes in the group,
monitoring the compliance with the group policy for
risk management and reporting to Group Management
and the Board of Directors. The CRO coordinates the
work through the Risk Management Committee with
members from Group Legal Affairs, Corporate Security,
Sustainability and Group Internal Audit.

Risk management process

The main components of the risk management process
are risk assessment, risk treatment and continuous
monitoring. Formal procedures and processes are es-
tablished within each function-based risk area and line
management is responsible for follow-up on the agreed
upon and reported risk treatment activities.

Compliance evaluations and assessments shall be con-

ment in order to ensure that all employees are aware

of and take steps to comply with the relevant require-

ments. Compliance means conforming to both external

and internal requirements such as the applicable legis-
lation, commitments to international norms and internal
policies, instructions and guidelines.

In 2012, the function-based risk areas and the Risk

Management Committee amongst others:

+ Conducted group-wide risk assessments to establish
a baseline for further compliance work, e.g. Human
Rights Impact Assessments

+ Initiated work to strengthen the compliance efforts,
e.g. deciding on coordination of vendor audits and
assessments

The objective of the continuous risk management pro-
cess is to regularly assess, treat and monitor business/
finance, sustainability and IT/security risks that may
harm the achievement of TeliaSonera’s objectives. The
line organization is responsible for assessing, mitigat-
ing and reporting risks. The reporting and follow-up is
facilitated by each risk area. Quarterly, the CRO con-
solidates risk reporting to Group Management and the
Board of Directors. The consolidated report is divided
into Financial, Business, Country, Legal and Regula-
tory, and Sustainability risks.

Business & Finance

Aprocess exists to regularly identify business and
financial risks that could lead to material misstatements
of financial information. The risks are reported by each
subentity and presented in quarterly business review
meetings.

Sustainability

The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for
sustainability issues and the TeliaSonera Code of Ethics
and Conduct. In operational terms, management at all
levels is responsible for putting the Code into practice.
At TeliaSonera group level, sustainability issues are the
responsibility of the Head of Group Communications,
who is amember of TeliaSonera Group Management.
Function-related activities are managed by the Head of
Sustainability, who reports to the Head of Group Com-
munications.

Sustainability risk management is integrated with
the line organization. A sustainability risk is an event,
uncertainty or threat scenario that might harm Telia-
Sonera’s goal to be economically, environmentally and
socially responsible throughout the business opera-
tions. The risks are related to failing to e.g. respect hu-
man rights, apply ethical business behavior, take care
of the well-being of the employees, ensure customer
privacy and freedom of expression as well as protect
children online.

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2012

> Corporate Governance Statement

Issues related to human rights, such as lawful intercep-
tion, network shutdowns, content-blocking, per-

sonal data-storing, government relations and license
agreements, pose a high risk to the telecom industry.
TeliaSonera is one of the initiators of an industry dia-
logue established among telecoms companies for the
purpose of developing guiding principles for actions to
be taken when their operations might be used for viola-
tions of freedom of expression and privacy.

Risks may also arise from merger and acquisition
(M&A) activities and the supply chain. To mitigate risks
arising from M&A activities, TeliaSonera has devel-
oped sustainability-related due diligence work, e.g. by
improving risk assessments in relation to countries and
potential business partners. The TeliaSonera Supplier
Code governs sustainability work and acting in the sup-
ply chain. To improve quality and efficiency of assuring
adherence to the Code, TeliaSonera in 2012 engaged
in the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) scheme for the ICT
sector.

Sustainability risk management is prioritized within
three sub-risk areas: Privacy and Freedom of Expres-
sion, Anti-corruption and Supply Chain. In 2013, the
risk and compliance work will focus on improvements
within all three areas.

IT & Security

Within IT and security, potential risks and threats are
continuously identified and mitigated to ensure that
TeliaSonera’s business strategies and objectives are
not jeopardized due to security and IT risks.

The risk and security work aims to control, facili-
tate and implement well-balanced security measures
throughout the operations. In TeliaSonera, security
measures are characterized by appropriate security
and risk awareness, prevention, preparedness, and the
ability to respond to, and recover from, incidents and
changes in the environment. Products, services, and
key strategic and operational processes must continu-
ously, throughout their life cycles, undergo thorough
analysis to identify risks and threats affecting the busi-
ness. The analysis aims to guide decision making and
ensure proper implementation of measures to meet
compliance and balance risk exposure.

Details about risks and uncertainties

Risks and uncertainties related to business, sustain-
ability and shareholder issues are further described in
Note C35 and financial risks in Note C27 to the consoli-
dated financial statements.

Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

In accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and
the Swedish Corporate Governance Code, the Board
of Directors is responsible for internal controls over
financial reporting. The Board continually reviews the
performance of internal controls and initiates activities
to foster continuous improvement of internal controls.

40

TeliaSonera’s risk management framework includes
internal controls over financial reporting, and is in line
with the COSO framework for internal controls. It con-
sists of interrelated areas, which are control environ-
ment, risk assessment, control activities, information
and communication, and monitoring.

Internal control is an integral part of TeliaSonera’s
corporate governance and enterprise risk management
which involves the Board of Directors, executive man-
agement and other employees. It is a process which
includes methods and processes to:

+ Safeguard the group’s assets

+ Ensure the reliability and correctness of financial
reporting

+ Secure compliance with applicable legislation and
guidelines

+ Ensure that objectives are met and continuous im-
provement of operational efficiency

The objective for TeliaSonera’s financial reporting is to
be in line with the highest professional standards and to
be full, fair, accurate, punctual and understandable.

Control environment
The most essential parts of TeliaSonera’s control
environment are the group policies. Management at
all levels is responsible for ensuring that group poli-
cies and requirements are implemented and applied.
Group-wide controls exist and are reviewed on an an-
nual basis. The purpose of the group-wide controls is to
ensure that the organization complies with Delegation
of obligation and authority, financial policies and the
reporting framework.
Management at each business unit or corporate
function is responsible for ensuring that:
+ Monthly and quarterly financial statements comply
with TeliaSonera’s accounting policies
+ Financial reports are delivered on time
+ Sufficient internal controls exist and are performed
+ Required reconciliations are properly done
+ Material business and financial risks are identified
and reported

The TeliaSonera financial shared services unit supports
harmonized and standardized financial accounting pro-
cesses and controls across large wholly-owned units.

Risk assessment

TeliaSonera has a risk based approach towards internal
controls over financial reporting. As described in sec-
tion “Enterprise Risk Management,” the management
of risks relating to the financial reporting is incorpo-
rated in the risk management framework, risk area
Business & Finance. As such, assessment and man-
agement of risks that may result in inaccurate finan-
cial reporting is a natural part of the daily work. Risk
assessments are performed both from a top-down and
bottom-up perspective.

TeliaSonera Annual Report 2012

> Corporate Governance Statement

Control activities

All business processes across TeliaSonera include
controls regarding the initiation, approval, recording
and accounting of financial transactions. Major pro-
cesses, including related risks and key controls (also IT
controls), are described and documented in a common
and structured way. Controls are either automated or
manual and designed to ensure that necessary actions
are taken to either prevent or detect material errors

or misstatements and to safeguard the assets of the
company. Controls for the recognition, measurement
and disclosure of financial information are included in
the financial closing and reporting process, including
controls for IT applications used for accounting and
reporting.

Information and communication

Instructions, guidelines and requirements regarding
accounting and reporting as well as performing internal
controls are made accessible to all relevant employees
through the use of TeliaSonera’s regular internal com-
munication channels. In recent years, staff at group
level has also significantly increased internal training
activities to ensure harmonization within important
areas such as revenue recognition, distinction between
capital and operating expenditure, etc.

Business operations performance metrics are
reported monthly and the results for all entities are
shared with all business unit managers and their man-
agement teams. The sharing gives a good opportunity
for benchmark and learning within the group.

TeliaSonera promotes an open, honest and trans-
parent flow of information, especially regarding the per-
formance of internal controls. Control performers are
encouraged to disclose any problems concerning their
controls in the monthly reporting, so that any problem
can be taken care of before it, possibly, causes errors
or misstatements.

Monitoring of control activities
TeliaSonera has implemented a structured monthly
process for the monitoring of the performance of
internal controls. This process includes all major busi-
ness units, business areas and corporate functions and
consists of a self-assessment of the performance of all
controls in the group. A risk-based testing of key con-
trols is carried out on behalf of management in order to
assess the quality of the internal controls.

The results of the monitoring and testing activities
are communicated to all relevant business units as
well as to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee
receives reports directly from both external and internal
auditors. The reports are discussed and follow-up
observations are made by the committee. Both the
external and internal auditors are represented at the
committee meetings. At least once a year, the entire
Board of Directors meets with the external auditors, in
part without the presence of management.

a

Control Activities in Business Operations

The purpose of internal controls over business opera-
tions is to monitor and support the development within
TeliaSonera’s corporate strategic focus areas. The
monitoring of business operations performance is
supported by defined metrics measurements; the Six
Sigma framework. The metrics measure, amongst oth-
ers, performance in networks and customers’ experi-
ence with TeliaSonera.

Monthly, the Board of Directors receives a summary
of metrics measures by business unit.

Six Sigma is a systematic problem solving methodol-
ogy that utilizes a broad set of statistical tools to meas-
ure, analyze and improve a company’s operational
performance, practices and systems. Lean Six Sigma
focuses on identifying waste and defects in opera-
tions by means of statistical analysis. It also focuses on
finding out and removing the root causes of problems.
At the end of 2012, TeliaSonera had altogether more
than 60 certified Six Sigma black belts and 370 green
belts. During 2012, 13 green belt courses and 1 black
belt course were arranged and as a result 93 new green
belts and 4 new black belts were certified.

IT Governance Approach

The TeliaSonera IT strategy was further developed
during 2012. The IT strategy stipulates how IT shall en-
able business success, in particular when addressing
business demand for improved customer experience,
business growth, cost efficiency and the One TeliaSon-
era approach.

IT supply is managed through four strategic focus
areas, as follows:
+ Improve customer experience
+ Provide agile and speedy IT services
+ Improve operational efficiency
+ One IT service company

IT Governance stipulates the governing bodies with
their roles and responsibilities in TeliaSonera, enabling
one common decision and efficient communication.

operations are an important part of the audit scope,
including on-site reviews with focus on revenue assur-
ance, processes and governance.

annual audit scope. The audit scope determines the
priorities and is also aligned with the business plan and
strategy in order to consider the overall business objec-
tives and risks. The audit scope is approved by the
Audit Committee and presented to the external auditors
on an annual basis. The detailed internal audit assign-
ments, within the audit scope, are defined on a quarter-
ly basis. The quarterly audit assignments are discussed
with the external auditors in order to identify areas for
mutual reliance and to avoid duplicate work.

The Head of Group Internal Audit reports adminis-
tratively to the CEO and CFO, and in addition, function-
based also to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.
