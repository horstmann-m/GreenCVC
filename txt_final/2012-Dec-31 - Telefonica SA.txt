2012 Consolidated Management Report

Financial results

The Telefonica Group is one of the world's leading mobile and fixed communications services providers.
Its strategy is to become a leader in the new digital world and transform the possibilities it brings into
reality.

Against this backdrop and with the aim of reinforcing its growth story, actively participating in the digital
world and capturing the most of the opportunities afforded by its scale and industrial alliances, in
September 2011 a new organizational structure was approved. This new structure, which was fully
operational in 2012, is as follows:

This new organization bolsters the Telefonica Group's place in the digital world, enabling it to tap any
growth opportunities arising in this environment, drive innovation, strengthen the product and services
portfolio and maximize the advantages afforded by its large customer bases in an increasingly connected
world. In addition, the creation of a Global Resources operating unit aims to ensure the profitability and
sustainability of the business by leveraging economies of scale and driving Telefonica's transformation
into a fully global group.

Telefonica Europe's and Telefonica Latin America's objective is to shore up the results of the business and
generate sustainable growth through available capacity, backed by the Global Corporation. The two
differentiated segments are as follows: (i) Telefonica Europe, which now includes Telefonica Spain as well
as the operations already forming part of the Telefonica Europe segment before; and (ii) Telefonica Latin
America. Group's results of 2011 and 2010 have been restated to reflect this organizational structure,
wothout any impact on consolidated figures.

The Telefonica Group's growth strategy for the next few years is geared towards:
. Improving the customer experience to continue increasing the number of accesses.
. Promoting growth:

- Boosting the penetration of smartphones in all markets to accelerate the growth of mobile data,
unlocking the value of its increased usage.

- Defending the competitive position in the wireline business with a focus on broadband, offering
faster speeds, bundled offers and full IP voice and video services.

- Leveraging growth opportunities arising in an increasingly digital environment: e.g. video, OTT,
financial services, cloud computing, eHealth and media.

. Continuing efforts to transform the Group's operating model:

- Increasing network capacity in the markets where we operate through technological advances
and acquisitions of spectrum.

- Accelerating the transformation primarily through the systems area.
- Proceeding towards becoming an international digital and online service provider group.
. Maximizing economies of scale to boost efficiency.

The Telefonica Group has operations in Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic, Ireland
and Slovakia in Europe, as well as Brazil, Mexico, several countries in Central America, Venezuela,
Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Ecuador in Latin America.

Telefonica has an industrial alliance with Telecom Italia, S.p.A. and a strategic alliance with China Unicom,
in which the Group holds a 5% stake. In addition, the “Partners Program” was created in 2011 in line with
the objective of unlocking the value of Telefonica's scale. Three operators have signed up for this program
(Bouygues, Etisalat and Sunrise). This initiative makes a host of services available to selected operators
under commercial terms that allow the partners to leverage on Telefénica's scale and to cooperate in key
business areas (e.g. roaming, services to multinationals, procurement, handsets, etc.)

2012 highlights

The Group's total accesses rose 3.0% year-on-year, to nearly 316 million at the 2012 year end, driven by
access growth in Latin America (5.5% year-on-year).

Telefonica Latin America's revenues rose 5.5% year-on-year and 6.7% in 2012 stripping out exchange
rate differences and hyperinflationary adjustments in Venezuela, underpinned by growth in the customer
base. The quality of the customer base itself has also improved, with a growing weight of contract and
smartphone customers.

Mobile data revenues continued to drive growth in 2012, drawing heavily from the steep rise in non-SMS
data revenues.

OIBDA in 2012 amounted to 21,231 million euros, with reported growth of 5.1%, affected by the
recognition of 2,671 million euros of restructuring expenses at Telefonica Spain in 2011 and the 527
million euros write-down made by the Telefonica Group against its stake in Telefonica Ireland in 2012,
due to the slowdown in activities in the prevailing market uncertainty.

The Telefonica Group's strategy is predicated on capturing growth in its markets and especially on
attracting high-value customers.

This strategy led to a 3.0% increase in total accesses, to nearly 316 million at the 2012 year end, driven
primarily by contract, mobile broadband and fixed broadband customers. Accesses in Telefonica Latin
America (67% of total) were particularly noteworthy, rising 5.5% compared to the December 2011 figure,
despite the disconnection of inactive customers in Brazil (1.6 million accesses) and the implementation of
more restrictive criteria concerning both new connections and disconnections. Total accesses in
Telefonica Europe dropped 1.9% year-on-year, due to the disconnection of 2.0 million inactive mobile
accesses in Spain in the first quarter of 2012.

Mobile broadband accesses stood at 52.8 million at December 2012, reflecting a solid 38% year-on-
year increase and representing 21% of mobile accesses (up 5 p.p. year-on-year).

At December 31, 2012, the Telefonica Group holds significant direct and indirect stakes (of over 5% in all
cases) in listed telecommunications companies other than in those in which it has control. These
companies are China Unicom and Telecom Italia, S.p.A.

Year ended December 31, 2012 compared with year ended December 31, 2011

The year 2012 was a key year in the transformation of Telefonica. Throughout the year, a number of
initiatives were undertaken aimed at helping the Company begin growing again. Telefonica Latin America
surpassed Telefonica Europe in revenues for the first time, continuing to be one of the group's two main
levers of growth, along with mobile data revenues. In Telefonica Europe, there has been a recovery in
sales activity in certain markets owing to the success of tariffs that have been launched, especially
“Movistar Fusion" in Spain, which reflect an improvement of its competitive position across different
markets, even though revenues of Telefonica Europe fell 6.5% with respect to 2011.

In view of the sale of the Atento Group in the fourth quarter of 2012, the results of that business area
were deconsolidated from the Telefonica Group as from the end of November 2012. This had an impact
on the year-on-year comparison of Telefonica's economic results in reporting terms.

OIBDA was also impacted by the 527 million euros write-down the Telefonica Group made against its
stake in Telefonica Ireland.

Revenues: Revenues for 2012 stood at 62,356 million euros, which represented a decrease of 0.8% on
the 2011 figure. This decrease was due to less favorable conditions in some markets, and the prevailing
economic situation, in which competition is steeper and regulatory changes have had adverse impacts.
The exchange rate differences and the effect of hyperinflation in Venezuela contributed 0.1 p.p. to
change in revenues; when stripping out this impact, the fall was 0.9% in 2012.

The Company's strong diversification continues to be a key differential for the Group in the current
market situation, as reflected by the revenues structure. In this regard, revenues showed solid growth in
Telefonica Latin America (up 5.5% year-on-year) and accounted for 49% of consolidated revenues (up

Telefnica,S.A. 203


--- Page 6 ---

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

2.9 p.p. compared to 2011), outperforming those of Telefonica Europe (48% of the Group's total and
down 6.5% year-on-year). Telefonica Spain's contribution to consolidated revenues decreased to 24%.

The decline in revenue compared to the year-ago figure was caused by the lower average revenue per
access for the Group, mainly due to lower average revenue per mobile access in Spain and the UK, and the
overall fall in average revenue per fixed access in the Group, which undermined the growth in accesses.
Revenues were hit hard by cuts to interconnection rates, which had a drag of approximately 1.1 p.p. on
overall revenue growth.

In terms of services, mobile data revenue continued to be the largest growth driver in 2012 (up 12.8%
year-on-year), accounting for over 34% of mobile service revenues in the period (31% in 2011). Non-SMS
data revenue climbed 24.1% year-on-year, raising its share of total data revenue by 5 p.p. to 57%.

Other income: Other income comprises the gains on disposals of assets, 782 million euros in 2012 (down
5.0% year-on-year). In 2012, other income primarily reflects: i) sales of non-strategic towers, with an
impact of 643 million euros on Other income (and OIBDA), primarily in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Spain and
Peru; ii) the sale of software applications (gains of 39 million euros; 18 million euros recognized in
Telefonica Spain); and iii) the fourth-quarter sales of the Atento Group (gains of 61 million euros), Rumbo
(gains of 27 million euros) and Hispasat (partial sale, gains of 26 million euros). In 2011, this caption
mainly reflected: i) the positive impact derived from the partial reduction of the Group's economic
exposure in Portugal Telecom (184 million euros); and ii) the sale of non-strategic towers (541 million
euros).

Total expenses, which include supplies, personnel expenses and other expenses (mainly external
services and taxes other than corporate income tax) stood at 43,448 million euros, down 2.9% on the
2011 figure. These expenses were affected by exchange rate differences and hyperinflation adjustments
(0.3 p.p.); when stripping out this impact, expenses were down 3.2%. The year-on-year variation reported
is also affected by the provision for restructuring expenses in Spain, made in the third quarter of 2011
(2,671 million euros). The year-on-year reduction in expenses is primarily explained by the absence of
similar restructuring charges in 2012 and lower commercial expenditure, especially in Spain, as a result of
anew commercial model in place from the end of 2011.

* Supply costs amounted to 18,074 million euros in 2012, down 1.0% on 2011, reflecting the
lower mobile interconnection costs and lower handset consumption in Spain resulting from the
new policy doing away with subsidies and the lower volume of handset upgrades.

¢ Personnel expenses were 8,569 million euros, down 22.7% on 2011. The year-on-year variation
was affected by the provision for personnel restructuring in Spain, mentioned above. When
stripping out the impact of this provision, which amounted to 2,671 million euros, personnel
expenses were 1.9% higher than in 2011, reflecting the adjustments for inflation in certain Latin
American countries.

The average headcount was 272,598 employees, 13,547 less than the 2011 average. The
decrease mainly reflects the sale of Atento in the fourth quarter of 2012. When stripping out the
Atento business, Telefénica's average headcount was 131,468 employees, 2,480 less than in
2011.

* Other expenses rose 9.1% year-on-year to 16,805 million euros. This increase was primarily
driven by the increase in external services caused by higher customer service costs, and network
and systems costs as well as the 527 million euros write-down of the Telefonica Group made
against its stake in Telefonica Ireland and by the capital loss (97 million euros) generated on the
sale of China Unicom shares.

OIBDA stood at 21,231 million euros, up 5.1% from 2011. When stripping out the negative impact of
exchange rate differences and hyperinflationary adjustments (0.3 p.p.), OIBDA grew by 5.4%. The OIBDA

Telefonica,S.A. 204


--- Page 7 ---

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

margin for 2012 was 34.0%, posting a year-on-year erosion of revenues that was not offset by cost
savings.

In terms of geographic segments, Telefonica Latin America had the largest contribution to consolidated
OIBDA (52.3%, down 1.6 p.p. compared to December 2011). Telefonica Europe accounts for less than
50%.

Depreciation and amortization rose by 2.8% year-on-year, to 10,433 million euros. This variation was
primarily due to amortization of new spectrum licenses acquired in Germany, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico
and Venezuela, and to the overall increase in fixed assets. Total depreciation and amortization charges
derived from purchase price allocation processes stood at 962 million euros in 2012 (down 14.1% year-
on-year).

Operating income in 2012 amounted to 10,798 million euros, a reported increase of 7.3%, helped by a
5.1% increase in OIBDA and hurt partially by a 2.8% increase in depreciation and amortization.

The share of profit (loss) of associates in 2012 reflects a loss of 1,275 million euros (vs. a loss of 635
million euros in 2011), primarily due to the write-down of Telco, S.p.A.'s investment in Telecom Italia and
the recovery of all the operating synergies considered at the time of this investment, with a net impact of
-1,355 million euros in 2012 and -662 million euros in 2011.

Net financial expense in 2012 totaled 3,659 million euros, 24.4% more than in 2011. This increase is
due to two effects: first, an increase in average cost of net debt primarily due to the increase in average
net debt (up 3.3% to a total of 58,187 million euros), the rise in credit spreads and the need to enhance
liquidity (with very low returns compared to the cost of the debt) as a result of the financial market crises;
and, secondly, to the increase in net exchange differences caused by the decline in estimated value of the
Venezuelan bolivar. In spite of the increase in credit costs, the Group's average cost of gross financial debt
held steady at 4.7%. Stripping out net exchange rate differences, such expenses implied an average cost
of net debt of 5.37% in 2012.

Corporate income tax in 2012 amounted to 1,461 million euros, implying an effect tax rate of 24.9%
over the 5,864 million euros of profit before tax, lower than statutory rates, mainly due to the recognition
of tax credits in several countries.

Profit attributable to non-controlling interests reduced net profit by 475 million euros in 2012, and
primarily reflects the share of Telefonica Brazil, Telefonica Czech Republic and Telefénica Germany's
profits attributable to non-controlling interests. The year-on-year variation (a decrease of 39.5%) was
due to reversal in the fourth quarter of 2011 of deferred tax liabilities recognized on the Vivo purchase
price allocation (1,288 million euros) as a result of the change in the tax value of certain assets acquired.

In all, the consolidated profit of 2012 amounted to 3,928 million euros (down 27.3% year on year).

Year ended December 31, 2011 compared with year ended December 31, 2010

Consolidated results in 2011 reflect the impact of consolidation of 100% of Vivo since October 1, 2010
(50% prior to that date).

Revenues: Revenues rose 3.5% in 2011, to 62,837 million euros. The full consolidation of Vivo had an
impact of 2,396 million euros. Exchange rates and the impact of hyperinflation in Venezuela subtracted -
0.7 p.p. from revenue growth in the year. Excluding both impacts, revenues are in line with those of the
prior year, with Latin America as the region with the highest contribution to revenues (46%) as well as to
its growth.

Overall revenue growth was driven by the growth of accesses, as average revenue per access for the
Group declined due to decreases in average revenue per mobile access in Europe and widespread

Telefonica,S.A. 205


--- Page 8 ---

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

decreases in the fixed line voice business. Excluding the impact of declines in interconnection tariffs,
revenue growth was slightly more than 1 p.p. higher.

Other income: Other income totaled 2,107 million euros and reflects gains on disposals of non-strategic
assets in the year, mainly in Latin America, in the amount of 541 million euros, and the positive impact
derived from the partial reduction of the Group's economic exposure from its stake in Portugal Telecom
(184 million euros). The variation in other income compared to 2010 is primarily due to the 2010
recognition of a capital gain of 3,797 million euros arising from the remeasurement of the previously held
investment in Brasilcel. Other income in 2010 also reflects gains on disposals of non-strategic assets and
the sale of Manx, for 260 million euros and 61 million euros, respectively. Other income in 2011 also
reflects the impact of lower ancillary income.

Total expenses, which include supplies, personnel expenses and other expenses (mainly external
services and taxes other than corporate income tax), were 44,734 million euros in 2011, up 9.6%
compared to 2010. The increase reflects the impact of full consolidation of Vivo from October 2010,
which amounted to 1,574 million euros, and the increase in personnel expenses due to the recognition in
2011 of 2,671 million euros of restructuring costs related to the labor force reduction plan approved by
the Group in Spain. In 2010, personnel expenses included 658 million euros of costs from the
restructuring of workforces of several Group companies. Also in 2010, 400 million euros of firm
commitments were recognized in relation to Telefonica Foundation's social program.

Excluding the aforementioned effects, total expenses slightly exceeded revenue growth due to:

* Supply and external services related to stronger commercial activity following the increasing
adoption of smartphones in all regions, which implies higher handset costs in Latin America due to
greater levels of commercial activity and to higher spending on 3G network deployment. However,
total supplies were offset by lower mobile interconnection expenses.

¢ Personnel expenses related to the increased headcount levels in Brazil and wage growth linked to
higher inflation in some of the region's markets.

¢ Increase in other expenses caused by higher customer service costs, higher commercial expenses
due to increased commercial activity and higher spending on 3G network deployment.

As a result of the above, OIBDA in 2011 decreased approximately 22% to 20,210 million euros from
25,777 million euros in 2010.

Depreciation and amortization increased by 9.1% in 2011, reflecting both the full consolidation of Vivo
and the amortization of assets in Vivo's purchase price allocation (336 million euros in 2011 compared to
84 million euros in 2010).

Operating income fell by approximately 39% to 10,064 million euros in 2011 from 16,474 million euros
in 2010. Excluding foreign exchange rate effects and the consideration of Venezuela as a
hyperinflationary economy, operating income would have decreased by 38% in the year.

The share of profit (loss) of associates reflects a loss of 635 million euros in 2011, compared to a profit
of 76 million euros in 2010. The variation is due to the impact of the valuation adjustment made by Telco,
S.p.A. to its stake in Telecom Italia, coupled with the impact of operational synergies considered in the
investment made in this company and the deconsolidation of Portugal Telecom.

Net financial expenses for 2011 increased by 11% year-on-year to 2,941 million euros, primarily a
result of the 13% rise in average financial debt, to a total of 56,351 million euros. This implied an average
cost of debt of 5.22% which, adjusting for exchange rate differences, fell to below 5% (4.91%). Net
financial debt increased by 711 million euros in the year to 56,304 million euros at December 31, 2011.
Foreign exchange gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased financial expenses
by 29 million euros.

Telefonica,S.A. 206

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

Corporate income tax in 2011 totaled 301 million euros (3,829 million euros in 2010), on a profit before
tax of 6,488 million euros. In 2011, deferred tax liabilities recognized in the Vivo purchase price allocation
of 1,288 million euros (952 million euros in profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent)
were reversed as a result of the change in the tax value of certain assets upon the merger of Telesp and
Vivo in October 2011, as they became tax deductible under Brazilian tax regulations.

Profit attributable to non-controlling interests reduced net profit by 784 million euros in 2011. This was
mainly due to non-controlling interests’ share in the profits of Telefonica Brazil (864 million euros), which
was affected by the exchange of Telesp shares for Vivo Participacgoes, and Telefonica Czech Republic
shares (95 million euros). These impacts more than offset the non-controlling interests’ share of losses of
Telefonica Telecom in Colombia.

As a result of all of the factors noted above, consolidated net profit for 2011 declined 46.9% to 5,403
million euros compared with 10,167 million euros in 2010.

As the preceding charts show, the Telefonica Group has high geographic diversification, with Telefonica
Europe (including Spain) and Telefonica Latin America showing similar shares in 2012. Spain and Brazil
are the largest single contributors to OIBDA in the Group, and also to revenues , followed by the UK,
Germany, Venezuela, Argentina and Chile. Together, these countries accounted for 87% of OIBDA and
81% of Group revenue in 2012 (83% of OIBDA and 82% of revenue in 2011 and 72% of OIBDA and 81%
of revenue in 2010, respectively), and are therefore those on which our discussion of segment results is
focused

Contribution to growth by country

(Excludes the effects of exchange reates and hyperinflation in Venezuela)

In the charts included below, we disclose the contribution to growth by country and segment excluding
the effects of exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela. It is the contribution to consolidated
growth of Revenues and OIBDA of main countries and segments, for 2011 and 2012. By way of
explanation the negative 3.7% of Telefénica Spain in 2012 means that Telefonica Spain's drop in
revenues caused a -3.7 p.p. decrease in total consolidated revenues in 2012, and the addition of all
countries’ contribution shown in the graph equals total group revenues drop in 2012 (-0.9% excluding the
impact of exchange rates).

(1) Internal estimates

Key trends in the mobile business

* Mobile accesses stood at 176.6 million, up 6.2% year-on-year, despite the disconnection of 1.6
million inactive pre-pay accesses in Brazil and the implementation of more restrictive criteria
concerning both new connections and disconnections in several countries in the region.

* Mobile broadband accesses soared 67.5% (down from 114% in 2011), representing 15% of the
region's total accesses, helping drive overall growth in revenues.

* The contract customer base grew 12.1% year-on-year and represented 22% of the total mobile
accesses in Latin America, in line with the growth strategy laid down for the region.

* Traffic in Telefonica Latin America grew 16% from 2011 to 2012, outperforming the growth of
accesses.

* — ARPU fell slightly (-0.2% year-on-year) despite the significant negative impact derived from the
reduction of mobile termination rates. Outgoing ARPU increased by 3.1% year-on-year reflecting
the Company's focus on maximizing customer value.

* Both OIBDA and the OIBDA margin for both years reflect the sale of non-strategic towers: 583 million
euros in 2012, and 541 million euros in 2011. The increase in expenses more than offset this impact.

Key trends in the fixed line business

* Broadband accesses grew 7.5% year-on-year, to 8.4 million, with a net addition of 586 thousand in
2012.

* Pay TV accesses were up 7.5% in 2012, to 2.4 million, with a net add of 169 thousand accesses in the
year.

* — Accesses in the fixed telephony business stood at 24.2 million, for year-on-year growth of 0.8%. This
increase primarily derives from the launch of convergent service offers and the rise in market share in
this service, thanks to "fixed wireless" technology.

2012 results

Telefonica Latin America represented 49% of consolidated revenue (up 2.9 p.p. compared to 2011) and
52.3% of consolidated OIBDA (a 1.6 p.p. decrease compared to 2011). The segment contributed 3.1 p.p.
to the year-on-year variation in the Group's revenues stripping out the impact of exchange rates, mainly
due to Venezuela's, Argentina's and Brazil's contribution.

* Telefonica Latin America reported a 5.5% year-on-year increase in revenue to 30,520 million euros
in 2012, despite the negative impact (-1.2 p.p.) of exchange rate differences and hyperinflationary
adjustments in Venezuela. These figures reflect the strong mobile service revenues generated in the
year 2012 (up 11.4%), despite the negative impact of regulations.

The mobile broadband business posted a 24.1% rise in mobile data revenues compared to 2011,
accounting for 29% of mobile services revenues (up 3 p.p. year-on-year). The increase in connectivity
revenues underpinned growth in non-SMS data revenues (up 32.9% in the year, accounting for 57%
of data revenues, up 4 p.p. year-on-year).

Revenues from handset sales increased by 17.9% to 1,661.4 million euros.

Brazil has shored up its role as the main regional market, accounting for 45% of the region's revenues
in 2012.

Revenue in the fixed line business was hit by the drop in fixed lines, which outweighed the growth in
broadband and TV, with lower ARPUs due to intense commercial activity.

¢ Total expenses in 2012 were 20,577 million euros, an increase of 6.8%. Exchange rate differences
and hyperinflation had an impact on total expenses of 322 million euros. Stripping out this impact,
the increase would have been 8.2%.

Expenses for supplies were 7,670 million euros, up 2.8%, due mainly to increased demand
for terminals related to the larger share of Smartphone sale, to higher content, digital and
data services costs and higher site lease costs for the deployment of towers and due to our
sale and leaseback of certain towers.

Personnel expenses rose 13.5% to 2,908 million euros, driven mostly by increases in
certain countries in the area with high inflation.

Other expenses rose 8.3% year-on-year to 9,999 million euros, driven by larger growth in
commercial activity and increased spending on customer services.

¢  OIBDA was 11,103 million euros in 2012, for reported year-on-year growth of 2.0% (up 1.1 p.p. when
stripping out the effect of exchange rate differences and hyperinflation in Venezuela). The OIBDA
margin was 36.4% for the year, down 1.3 p.p. compared to 2011.

* Both OIBDA and the OIBDA margin for 2011 and 2012 reflect the sale of non-strategic
towers: 583 million euros in 2012, and 541 million euros in 2011.

* — In 2012 a number of factors (integration expenses, brand changes and reversal of provisions
in Brazil, service interruptions in Argentina, retroactive impact of the new Venezuela labor
law, etc.) brought OIBDA down by 42 million euros.

* Following a contractual change in the handset sales model in Chile, as from the fourth
quarter of 2012, OIBDA is affected by the new accounting treatment given for revenues and
expenses formerly linked to a mobile handset sales model involving lease without charge,
with a negative impact of 22 million euros in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

2011 results

Telefonica Latin America represented 46% of consolidated revenue and 54% of consolidated OIBDA in
2011. It was also the largest contributor (6.3 p.p.) to revenue growth in the year. At the OIBDA level, the
contribution declined 10.2 p.p. due to the recognition of 3,797 million euros in 2010, derived from the re-
measurement of our previously held investment in VIVO at its fair value at the date of our acquisition of
the 50% of Brasilcel held by Portugal Telecom.

¢ Telefonica Latin America reported a 13.6% increase in revenue in 2011, to 28,941 million euros,
despite the negative impact (-1.6 p.p.) of exchange rate differences and hyperinflation in Venezuela.
Results for this region are also impacted by the full consolidation of Vivo since October 2010. When
excluding Mexico, which was affected by the performance of pre-pay revenues and the sharp
reduction in mobile termination rates, revenue growth was strong in the region. As shown herein, the
growth in the mobile business was driven by significant increases in both the customer base and
mobile ARPU in virtually all countries. Revenue in the fixed line business was hit by the drop in fixed
lines, which outweighed the growth in broadband and TV, with lower ARPUs due to significant
competitive pressures.

Finally, revenue trends indicate higher growth in mobile service revenues due to the Group's efforts
to boost commercial activity (e.g. increased spending by content and service providers, increased
cost of high-end handsets, etc.) in a bid to tap the growth potential of the market despite the
negative short-term impact on commercial expenses.

Brazil represented 49% of total revenue in Latin America in 2011, reinforcing its status as the
region's leading market and the main driver of Telefonica's organic revenue growth in Latin America.

¢ Total expenses amounted to 19,258 million euros, 15% higher than in 2010. In 2010, total expenses
were 16,677 million euros, although this would increase by 1,638 million euros if we added 50% of
VIVO from January to September for purposes of comparison with 2011.

In addition, 2010 included one-off costs from the restructuring of workforces of 410 million euros.
Foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation contributed 261 million euros to total expenses. Like-for-
like (i.e. stripping out these impacts), total expenses increased by 5.8%. The increase compared to
2010 was mainly the result of increased commercial activity than in the same period a year earlier,
aimed at boosting the Company's future revenue growth.

Expenses in supplies rose in line with market trends, driven by growth of the new businesses,
higher expenditure on content providers, circuits, sites and tower sales; and handsets costs, due
to the growing weight of high-end handsets, such as smartphones.

Personnel expenses rose as the result of the internalization of contractors in Brazil and higher
inflation in some Latin American economies.

The increase in other expenses was due to efforts to maintain high quality and customer
service, which leads to larger fees and commissions, higher network and systems costs, larger
energy costs related to both new sites and network deployment.

*  OIBDA for Telefonica Latin America fell 20.1% in 2011 to 10,890 million euros, affected by:

¢ The consolidation of the remaining 50% of Vivo, which would have added nearly 900 million
euros had this taken place at the beginning of 2010.

¢ Foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in Venezuela, which reduced OIBDA in Latin America
by 128 million euros.

¢ The recognition in 2010 of a 3,797 million euros gain deriving from the remeasurement of the
previously held investment in Vivo at its fair value at the date of our acquisition of the 50% of
Brasilcel previously held by Portugal Telecom.

¢ The recognition in 2010 of non-recurring restructuring charges of 410 million euros.

Excluding these effects, OIBDA for Telefonica Latin America was virtually flat in 2011, as revenue
growth was offset by the increased commercial activity (larger share of high-end handsets), and
efforts to enhance quality —affecting network and system costs- and customer service.

The Brazilian telecommunications market continues to grow, particularly in mobile and broadband data.
In this setting, the company's operations in Brazil performed well. We continue to hold leading market
positions in terms of mobile accesses and revenues based on internal estimates, although the share of
fixed broadband accesses has eroded due to aggressive commercial efforts by competitors.

During the year, several new sales efforts were launched in the mobile segment, continually repositioning
consumer plans in order to boost the market share in data services and voice traffic, as well as in the fixed
business, rolling out convergent services and developing fixed wireless technology outside Sao Paulo.
This technology is currently in place in the country's main metropolitan regions. In the television
segment, the company launched the IPTV pay TV service in October and the OTT "Vivo Play" service (on
demand video) in December 2012. The company also rolled out a 200 Mb fixed broadband offer through
the fiber network, a notable market milestone.

2012 results

* Revenues amounted to 13,618 million euros in 2012, for year-on-year growth of 2.3% in local
currency. Revenues from the mobile business came in at 8,573 million euros for the year, up 9.4% in
local currency compared to 2011, where service revenues close at 9.7% in local currency compared
to 2011 thanks to the good evolution of the outgoing revenues boosted by the average customer
base growth and the growing weight in data revenues. This is partially offset by the incoming
revenue fall (and consequent ARPU decrease) affected by the negative impact of the lower mobile
termination rates. Additionally, our customer base in Brazil suffered a drop due to the disconnection
in the second quarter of 1.6 million inactive prepay mobile accesses in Brazil.

The fixed business reported revenues of 5,045 million euros, down 7.8% in local currency due to lower
retail fixed-mobile rates and to steep competition in the fixed broadband and pay TV businesses.

¢  OIBDA stood at 5,161 million euros in 2012, up 4.8% in local currency driven by mobile revenues
growth, offset by fixed voice revenues drop as well as expenses growth due to higher personnel costs
coming from the internalization of contractors and workforce restructuring expenses and the
increase of external services costs, associated to a higher commercial activity. On the other hand,
OIBDA was positively affected by the recognition of 445 million euros in other income derived from
the sale of non-strategic assets, compared to 187 million euros in 2011. The overall OIBDA margin
was 37.9%, a0.9 p.p. improvement on 2012.

* — The consolidation of the additional 50% of Vivo since October 2010, which affected period-to-
period comparisons.

¢ — The full consolidation of TVA from June 2011, with retroactive effects from January 1, 2011. TVA
contributed 81 million euros to revenue and 22 million euros to OIBDA in 2011.

In addition, following the transfer of the long-distance license from Telesp to Vivo in the last quarter
of 2011, long-distance revenues were reclassified such that long-distance revenues arising in the
mobile network are attributed to the mobile business and those from the fixed network to the fixed
line business, and shown net of eliminations. This has no impact at the consolidated level, but affects
the year-on-year comparability of the mobile and fixed line businesses.

Like-for-like mobile service revenues (i.e. including the impacts in both years) were 10.6% higher in
2011, in line with the growth in our customer base, with ARPU falling 3.6% due to aggressive
commercial activity in the region. Data business revenues, representing 24% of service revenues,
reflected a solid performance and became a key driver of the company's future growth.

In the fixed line business, revenue adjusted, reduced by the transfer of the long-distance license,
decreased by 1.4% in local currency. Growth in broadband (11% in local currency) and TV (45% in
local currency, but not comparable due to the addition of TVA) was insufficient to offset the decline
in the traditional voice business, mainly because of the loss of open lines (not bundled or pre-pay or
controlled usage).

OIBDA: OIBDA in Brazil amounted to 5,302 million euros in 2011, and, as with revenues, is not
comparable to prior year results due to the impact of consolidation of the additional 50% stake in
Vivo since October 2010. The contribution to OIBDA in the first nine months of 2010 would be
approximately 900 million euros. Excluding this impact and the 60 million euros recognized in 2010
for workforce restructuring expenses, the OIBDA margin would be similar in 2011 and 2010. OIBDA
also includes proceeds from the disposal of non-strategic assets of 186 million euros in 2011 and 117
million euros in 2010.

2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

In 2012, based on internal estimates, Telefonica Argentina maintained its market leadership,
underpinned by a benchmark services portfolio with integrated fixed and mobile broadband bundles and
added value services. The company applies a segmented approach in order to cover the diverse needs of
its customer base. The key feature of the mobile business in 2012 was the heavy across-the-board
increase in the mobile broadband service. In the fixed line business, the company retained its market
leadership in both fixed line and broadband accesses in terms of market shares, based on internal
estimates, maintaining growth in the number of lines, unlike the other operations in the region.

The financial results in Argentina for the year were negatively affected by compensation paid to
customers in respect of a software outage in Movistar's national network equipment, which affected
service on April 2, 2012. In addition, results were also adversely affected by the heavy storm that hit the
northern part of Buenos Aires on April 4, 2012.

* Revenues: Service revenues from the mobile business grew sharply in 2012 (19.0% excluding
foreign exchange rate effects), reflecting higher usage levels, driven by data usage and growth in the
customer base. Data revenues are the main lever for growth (33.5%, excluding exchange rate
differences).

* Revenues: Growth in mobile service revenues (12.9% in local currency) was driven by a base of
higher value customers, as seen in the increase in ARPU and the weight of the contract segment.
Mobile data ARPU growth was driven by both the positive performance of SMS and the higher

number of customers with data rates.

Telefonica maintained its position as one of the leaders in the Chilean telecommunications market,
strengthening its competitive advantage through an integrated and unique service offer, despite the stiff
market competition. In 2012, Telefonica Chile's commercial activity was negatively affected by the
nationwide introduction of number portability, in both the mobile and the fixed businesses.

During the year, the company promoted mobile broadband and high-speed fixed broadband, both in
VDSL and fiber optic technology, and continually enhanced its offers through bundled services. In late
2012, the company launched the new IPTV platform, following an alliance with Microsoft that made it
possible to bundle broadband services and improve its television offers.

underpinned by broadband and new services revenues (52% of revenues and up 10.9% in local

OIBDA: OIBDA dropped 7.3% in local currency in local currency despite revenues are increasing 3.3%
due to a higher commercial activity in the mobile business with the start-up of portability, which
results in higher growth in supplies, content and interconnection expenses plus the negative effect in
other revenues of the sale of towers (32 million euros compared to 50.1 million euros in 2011). In
addition, following a contractual change in the handset sales model in Chile, OIBDA is affected by the
negative effect of the new accounting treatment applicable to revenues and expenses formerly
linked to a mobile handset sales model involving lease without charge that was previously accounted
as Capex (negative impact of 22 million euros, all included in the last quarter of the year).

2011 results

Revenues: Mobile revenues rose 10.1% in local currency to 1,399 million euros in 2011, fuelled by the
strong growth in service revenues. Service revenues increased by 8.9% in local currency, as a result of
the growth in the customer base, offsetting the downtrend in ARPU caused by the drop in usage from
pre-pay customers. Data revenues also had a positive performance, with a 34% increase in the year in
local currency, representing 19% of total service revenues.

Fixed line revenues in Chile remained stable with respect to 2010, with the 12.3% increase in Internet,
TV and content revenues offsetting the 8% decrease in local currency in traditional business
revenues.

OIBDA: OIBDA decreased 5.5% in local currency, partly due to the recognition in 2010 of damage
compensation received on insurance contracts following earthquake damage in February 2010 and
gains from the disposal of non-strategic assets (15 million euros) in 2010. Gains on the sale of non-
strategic assets in 2011 amounted to 50 million euros OIBDA for the year was also impacted by the
24% increase in supply costs (excluding foreign exchange rate effects) caused by higher
interconnection costs from increased traffic and greater equipment costs resulting from the increased
commercial activity in the mobile business attributable to purchases of high-end handsets.

The company launched its "Zero Prepayment" campaign in the latter part of the year, allowing customers
to call any fixed or mobile operator in Mexico, the US or Canada for 0.85 Mexican pesos/minute. This
campaign was a milestone in the strategy to reduce rates within the "call anywhere" plans, rolled out
following the drastic reduction in interconnection rates in the first half of 2011. In addition, through the
year the company unveiled new data plans aimed at boosting the mobile broadband business. These
plans include the LTE launch, with Movistar being the first operator to offer this service in Mexico. All
these efforts reflect the companu's strategic focus on innovation and quality of service.

It should also be noted that in the second half of 2012 the agreement on national roaming with lusacell
came into effect, significantly reinforcing the coverage and capacity of the services that both companies
provide (lusacell and Telefonica Méviles México).

* Revenues amounted to 1,596 million euros in 2012, for 0.4% growth year-on-year in local currency.
Mobile service revenues remained stable compared to 2011 in local currency amounting to 1,416
million euros in 2012 thanks to an increase in data revenues, despite an estimated negative impact
of 64 million euros from the lower interconnection rates approved by the regulatory authorities in
the second quarter of 2011. Data revenues climbed 15.0% from 2011 to 2012, despite the 54%
reduction in SMS interconnection rates in September 2012. Data revenues account for 33% of
mobile service revenues (up 4 p.p. year-on-year). Non-SMS data revenues rose 61.8% year-on-year,
accounting for 39% of data revenues (up 11 p.p. compared to 2011).

* OIBDA: OIBDA was 432 million euros in 2012 (down 26.1% year-on-year in local currency), for an
OIBDA margin of 27.0%, strongly impacted by the sale of non-strategic towers in 2011, which
amounted to 240 million euros compared with the year-on-year comparison to 77 million euros for
tower sales in 2012. Stripping out this effect, OIBDA grew 6.5%, slightly over revenue evolution. It is
important to highlight the interconnection rates reduction which negatively impacted OIBDA by 14
million euros. Such rate reduction is more than offset by a higher level of efficiency coming from the

Telefonica,S.A. 223


--- Page 26 ---

lusacell roaming agreement and higher commercial efficiency. For 2012, OIBDA margin was 27.0%,
due to the gradual improvement in margin throughout the year.

2011 results

* Revenues: Service revenues decreased by 13.3% in local currency to 1,387 million euros, principally
as the result of the aforementioned reductions in interconnection tariffs and the impact of lower
revenue from outgoing traffic in the pre-pay segment attributable to decreased usage. These changes
prompted the Company to launch new commercial offers in the second half of the year.

* OIBDA: The decrease in OIBDA was caused by increased costs associated with the Companu's overall
commercial repositioning efforts and 3G network deployment, as well as the impact of the
interconnection tariff reductions described above. The 2011 decrease in OIBDA was partially offset by
the sale of non-strategic assets, which resulted in a gain 240 million euros.

2012 results

¢ In 2012, revenues amounted to 2,400 million euros, up 4.6% year-on-year in local currency, due to
growth in both the mobile and fixed businesses.

Revenues in the mobile business (up 6.9%) were driven by voice and data revenues, with a year-on-
year rise of 44.8% despite adverse regulatory impacts which affected fixed-mobile calls (due to a
decrease in the regulated retail rate) and the mobile interconnection rate cuts in October 2011 and
2012. On the other hand, handset revenues fall by 4.4% year-on-year. Revenues from the fixed
business totaled 1,226 million euros in 2012, up 1.5% on the prior year. As in 2011, broadband and
new services revenues were the primary growth drivers, with a year-on-year rise of 12.9%, offsetting
a sharp decline in voice revenues.

* OIBDA stood at 909 million euros in 2012 (up 7.1% year-on-year), mainly explained by the good
revenue performance, partially offset by higher commercial costs driven by the increased commercial
activity relating to higher-value customers, higher taxes related to the canon for the usage of radio
electric spectrum and also the personnel expenses increase related to the employee participation of
the company results (employees get a percentage of net income of the company). This OIBDA growth
is positively affected by the recognition in 2012 of 23 million euros gains from the sale of non-
strategic assets, compared to gains of 2 million euros in the fourth quarter of 2011. Finally the OIBDA
margin places at 37.9% (up 0.9 p.p. compared to 2011).

2011 results

* Overall, the business performed well, resulting in a 6% increase in revenue in local currency despite
the reduction in interconnection rates in the mobile network in October, 2011. The increase in
revenue was due to the strong performance by the mobile business and the maintenance of the
traditional fixed telephony business.

* OIBDA is not comparable to the prior year due to the recognition in 2010 of gains from the sale of
non-strategic assets (39 million euros) and workforce restructuring expenses (23 million euros).

The year 2012 has meant a significant milestone in the development of Telefénica's operations in
Colombia after the Telefonica Méviles Colombia, S.A. and Colombia Telecomunicaciones S.A. merger
(completed at the end of June 2012), through which the company brought all of its operations in the
country (fixed and mobile services) together under the Movistar brand. Telefonica shored up the
integrated sale of products, bundling fixed and mobile services, while maintaining its focus on higher-
value customers.

Telefonica Colombia reported 14.1 million accesses at the 2012 year end, for a year-on-year growth of
2.7%.

2012 results

Revenues totaled 1,765 million euros in 2012 (year-on-year growth of 1.6% in local currency),
thanks to the strong performance of the mobile business, despite lower ARPU and the reduction in
mobile termination rates. The fixed business reported revenues of 695 million euros, down -4.7% in
local currency due to a lower number of accesses, the increase of competition in an already highly
competitive environment and the reduction in termination rates.

OIBDA was 607 million euros at the 2012 year end, up 1.0% compared to the prior year as a result of
higher revenues (up 1.6% year-on-year) and operating expenses decreasing 2.2% year-on-year,
thanks to the efficiency measures applied by the business operator in Colombia, which were mainly
reflected in lower personnel and subcontract expenses. Supply costs also fell year-on-year due to the
reduction in termination rates. These were offset by the year-on-year comparison affected by
recognition of gains on the sale of non-strategic towers of 2 million euros in 2012 and 25 million
euros in 2011.

2011 results

Solid business growth resulted in a 4.5% increase in revenues in local currency, underpinned by
strong revenues from the mobile business.

OIBDA increased by 14.2% in 2011 and was impacted by sales of non-strategic assets during 2011
(25 million euros) and 2010 (71 million euros). The comparability at the OIBDA level was also
impacted by the recognition in 2010 of 85 million euros of non-recurring workforce restructuring
expenses, bad debts provisions, and third-party claims.

Following reorganization of the Telefonica Group in September 2011, two segments (business units) were
defined in the Group. One of these segments is Telefonica Europe, which includes operations in Spain as
well as those in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Ireland.

Telefonica Europe operators have aimed to set the groundwork for future growth in 2012 by leveraging
the success of their sales efforts (e.g. “Movistar Fusion” in Spain) and the greater efficiencies derived from

Telefonica,S.A. 228


--- Page 31 ---

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

the transformation initiatives rolled out during the year. These initiatives focus on improving resource
allocation, costs and strategic investing.

All these efforts have allowed Telefonica Europe to stabilize in 2012, by containing operating costs in
several areas despite the pressure on revenues caused by declines in usage, the adverse economic
environment, strong market competition and lower mobile interconnection and roaming rates.

Key trends in the mobile business

* Mobile accesses stood at 70.6 million, a year-on-year decrease of 2.5%. This figure was strongly
affected by the disconnection of 2.0 million inactive accesses in Telefonica Spain in the first
quarter of 2012. Growth in mobile accesses was especially strong in Germany in 2012 (up 5.0%),
with 19.3 million customers, and to alesser extent in the United Kingdom (up 3.1%), with 22.9
million customers.

¢ Solid sales efforts translated into a growth in mobile contract customers of 1.9%. These
customers accounted for 60% of the total mobile customer base at the 2012 year end (up 2 p.p.
compared to the prior year).

¢ Mobile broadband accesses increased 16% to 25.5 million, representing 36% of the region's
total accesses and driving growth in revenues.

¢ ARPUs of some European operators (mainly Spain and the UK) are under heavy pressure,
affected by interconnection rates cuts, an adverse economic backdrop (with waning
consumption) and, in some cases, decreases in prices amid fierce competitive pressure.

Key trends in the fixed line business

¢ Retail fixed line broadband accesses stood at 9.6 million, a year-on-year decrease of 1.1%.
Nevertheless, this trend reversed in the fourth quarter of 2012 as these accesses increased,
when net adds were obtained as a consequence of the launch of "Movistar Fusion,” a convergent
product in Telefonica Spain

e Fixed telephone accesses were down 1.9% year-on-year, to 15.8 million at December 2012.

Telefonica Europe represents 48% of the Group's 2012 revenues and OIBDA. Its revenues decreased by
6.5% in 2012, contributing -4.0 p.p. to the year-on-year variation in the Group's revenues, excluding
foreign exchange rate effects, primarily due to lower revenues in Telefonica Spain (contributing -3.7 p.p.).
In addition, at 2012 year end, the Group recorded a 527 million euros write-down in the value of its stake
in Telefonica Ireland in Telefonica Europe's OIBDA and in 2011, and the Group recognized personnel
restructuring expenses of 2,591 million euros in Telefonica Spain's OIBDA.

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

Telefonica Europe posted revenues of 29,995 million euros in 2012, down 6.5% on the 2011 figure
(down 7.8% excluding foreign exchange rate effects). The year-on-year decrease in Telefonica
Europe's revenues is primarily due to revenue trends in Telefonica Spain, which dropped 13.2% from
2011, to 14,985 million euros in 2012. This reduction in revenues mainly reflects lower accesses and
ARPU in the different services, all within an adverse and highly-competitive macroeconomic
environment.

At Telefonica Spain, revenues in the fixed line business plunged 10.2%. This reduction was
primarily due to lower revenues from traditional accesses (caused by the loss of accesses), the
16.7% decrease in voice services revenues (affected by the growing weight of flat-rate plans and
traffic packages) and the 13.8% drop in retail broadband revenues (12.2% year-on-year decrease in
broadband ARPU, affected by customer migration to new rates). Revenues from the mobile
business fell 16.6% on the 2011 figure. This reduction reflects the 16.8% drop in mobile service
revenues (chiefly pressured by trends in ARPU and the reduction in interconnection rates effective as
from April and October, and in roaming rates, effective as from July). Telefonica Spain accounted for
50% of Europe’s revenue.

In the rest of Telefonica Europe's operations, revenues rose 1% year-on-year, driven by growth in
revenues in Germany, but undermined by reduction to interconnection and roaming rates.

The mobile strategy, based on boosting mobile broadband penetration and limited use data rates,
was the main factor to promote revenue growth. As a result of this strategy, total data revenue
increased 5.8% in 2012 and represented 41% of mobile service revenue (up 5 p.p. compared to
2011). The growth in data revenue is primarily due to the 18.6% increase in non-P2P SMS revenues,
which represented 58% of total data revenues in 2012.

Total expenses at Telefonica Europe amounted to 20,465 million euros, down 12.7% on the previous
year, affected by the recognition in 2011 of 2,591 million euros of restructuring expenses in
Telefonica Spain, which affected the variance in personnel expenses. This impact represented 11 p.p.
of the year-on-year decline. Excluding this effect, operating expenses would have fallen 1.8% year-
on-year.

¢ Supplies expenses decreased 4.6% year-on-year in 2012 to 9,821 million euros, mainly driven
by lower interconnection costs, and, to a lesser extent, lower supplies, due to a new commercial
strategy of subsidies in Spain.

¢ Personnel expenses amounted to 3,497 million euros in the year, a decline of 45.4% compared
with 2011, mainly due to the provision included in Spain mentioned above. Excluding this impact
personnel expenses decreased by 8.9% year-on-year in 2012 mainly on the back of the increase
of company savings related to the restructuring plan in Spain.

¢ Other expenses were 7,147 million euros and increased by 6.1% as a consequence of including
the 527 million euros write-down in the value of Telefénica’s stake in Telefénica Ireland, due to
the slowdown in activities in the prevailing market uncertainty. Excluding this impact, other
expenses would have dropped by -1.8% reflecting the higher commercial efficiency delivered by
the leaner business model.

OIBDA in Telefonica Europe stood at 10,244 million euros in 2012, up 10.4% year-on-year (9.5%
when stripping out exchange rate differences). The 2012 figure includes the 527 million euros write-
down of the Group's stake in Telefonica Ireland, while 2011 OIBDA reflects workforce restructuring
expenses in Telefonica Spain in the amount of 2,591 million euros. OIBDA performance is also
affected by pressures on revenues (including the impact of lower regulatory interconnection rates),
partially offset by costs savings generated from the efficiency initiatives implemented throughout
the Group.

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

2011 results

In 2011, Telefonica Europe represented 51% of the Group's revenues, and 46% of OIBDA. Telefonica
Europe dragged -2.7 p.p. to Group's revenue growth on a constant euros basis. The main contributor to
this negative contribution to Group revenues was Telefonica Spain, which contributed 2.4 p.p. to the
Group's revenue drop. Reported OIBDA of Telefonica Europe showed a 26% year-on-year decline, but, it is
important to highlight that OIBDA for 2011 reflected workforce restructuring expenses of 2,591 million
euros in Telefonica Spain, while the 2010 figure included workforce restructuring expenses of 202 million
euros for Telefonica Spain and 320 million euros for other Telefonica Europe operations (recognized
under personnel expenses). The aforementioned impacts contribute to the year-on-year decrease by -17
p.p. Excluding these effects, the year-on-year decrease in Telefonica Europe's OIBDA would be 9.2%,
primarily derived from the 13% year-on-year decline in Telefonica Spain (excluding restructuring
expenses).

* Revenues (32,066 million euros at December 2011) were down 4.9% on 2010, mainly reflecting the
drop in Telefonica Spain's revenues.

In 2011, Telefonica Spain's revenue fell 7.7% to 17,269 million euros, pulled down by lower ARPU in
the various services and lower accesses, amid waning consumption and stronger pressure on prices.

Telefonica's Spain revenues in the fixed line business decreased by 6.8% year-on-year, mostly
because of lower revenues from traditional accesses, voice services and retail broadband. Also,
Telefonica's Spain revenues from mobile services were down 10.0%, primarily reflecting a 10%
drop in ARPU following the reduction in interconnection rates, lower consumption, and pressure
on retail prices.

In the rest of Telefonica Europe's operations, revenues were down 1.5%, primarily due to lower
interconnection rates. These decreased, coupled with the impact of exchange rates, adversely
affected revenues. Excluding these effects, revenues would have increased by 2.1%.

In Telefonica Europe, revenues from mobile data continued to grow steadily, up 10.4% year-on-
year. At December 2011, these revenues accounted for 35.7% of mobile service revenues (up 5.4
p.p. compared to the year-ago figure). This upward trend was underpinned by the solid year-on-
year growth in non-SMS data revenues, which rose 29.3% over the course of 2011, to account
for 51.8% of total data revenues (up 7.6 p.p. year-on-year). The mobile data strategy, focusing
on expanding the Group's market share in mobile broadband and on limited-use data rates, was a
key factor to this performance.

* Total expenses at Telefonica Europe amounted to 23,432 million euros, up 7.6% on the previous
year, affected by the recognition of 2,591 million euros of restructuring expenses in Telefonica Spain.
This impact, recognized in personnel expenses, accounted for 12 p.p. of the increase.

¢ Supplies expenses decreased 2.9% year-on-year in 2011 to 10,294 million euros, mainly driven
by lower interconnection costs.

* Personnel expenses amounted to 6,400 million euros in the year, an increase of 49.8%
compared with 2010, mainly due to the provision included in Spain mentioned above. Excluding
this impact personnel expenses decreased by 10.8% year-on-year in 2011.

¢ Other expenses amounted to 6,738 million euros and decreased by 2.2% as a consequence of
lower customer Service costs.

¢  OIBDA stood at 9,278 million euros at December 2011, representing a reported year-on-year
decrease of 26.0%. OIBDA was primarily affected by:

Telefonica,S.A. 231

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

. Workforce reduction expenses in Spain (2,591 million euros in the third quarter of 2011, and
202 million euros in the fourth quarter of 2010).

. Restructuring expenses in other European countries, primarily in respect of personnel
restructuring (320 million euros in the second half of 2010).

Reported OIBDA of Telefonica Europe showed a 26.0% year-on-year decline, with the two
aforementioned impacts accounting for -17 p.p. of the variance. The year-on-year decline in OIBDA
was also due to pressure on revenues (including the impact of lower regulatory interconnection
rates) and to the higher commercial expenditure generated on the launch of new high-end
smartphones in the last quarter of 2011, among other sales efforts.

Telefonica Spain continued with the transformation strategy rolled out in the second half of 2011. This
strategy has led to major changes in the sales and operating model, beginning with improvements to the
value proposition and service quality at year-end 2011 through the launch of a new rates portfolio, taken
up by a wide percentage of the customer base by December 2012. In March 2012, the Company rolled
out a new handset sales model, focused on building customer loyalty and phasing out subsidies to attract

customers. This generated considerable savings in sales costs, as did the greater efficiencies derived from
the lower personnel expenses, among others.

In October 2012, Telefonica Spain furthered this strategic approach with the launch of “Movistar Fusi6n,"
a convergent product that bundles all home communications needs in a single product, at an attractive
price, and features unique services such as fiber optics and special TV content. The launch of the "Fusion"
product marked a change in the Company's sales focus, towards growth in high-value services. This
allowed the Company to recover a net add in fixed broadband, and enabled a net add in fiber, while
boosting smartphone adoption.

All these measures have strongly contributed to the higher customer satisfaction reached in 2012 based
on internal estimates, as well as to the lower number of customer claims and decreased churn, a
fundamental aspect of the improvement in sales activity.

Moreover, despite the strong investment for the roll-out of fiber, the 2012 investment was lower than
that made in 2011, due to the greater efficiency derived from the quality increase, the lower churn, the
streamlining of systems and the focus on prioritizing the development of new services.

* In 2012, revenues totaled 14,985 million euros (down 13.2% year-on-year), primarily reflecting
lower accesses and the lower ARPU across different services in a highly-competitive and adverse
macroeconomic environment.

Revenues in the fixed line business amounted to 9,541 million euros in 2012, a year-on-year
decrease of 10.2%. This reduction was primarily due to lower revenues from traditional accesses
(down 9.3% caused by the loss of accesses), a 16.7% decrease in voice services revenues (affected
by the growing weight of flat-rate plans and traffic packages) and a 13.8% drop in retail broadband
revenues (a 12.2% year-on-year decrease in effective broadband ARPU, affected by customer
migration to new rates).

Revenues from the mobile business totaled 6,453 million euros in 2012, down 16.6% on the 2011
figure. This reduction reflects a 16.8% drop in mobile service revenues (due to negative trends in
ARPU and the reduction in interconnection rates effective as from April and October, and in roaming
rates, effective as from July).

Mobile data revenues were down 4.6% year-on-year, despite the steady growth in non-SMS
revenues (up 8.2% from 2011), accounting for 85% of total data revenues (up 10 p.p. year-on-year).
The trends in these revenues primarily reflect the lower SMS revenues, the higher weight of fixed-
rate data plans, driven in the last quarter by the "Fusion" product, and by the migration of customers

Telefnica,S.A. 233

with USB modems toward more affordable multi-device options. In addition, data revenues continue
to be affected by the shift in the Premium SMS sales strategy in November 2011 (70% year-on-year
decrease in Premium SMS revenues in 2012).

Mobile traffic dropped 9% from 2011 to 2012, as customers reduced their usage in line with the
general contraction of household spending in an adverse macroeconomic environment.

Total ARPU for 2012 was down 7.1% year-on-year. The 2011 ARPU figure is not comparable to
2012 ARPU, as in 2012 it is affected by the disconnection of 2.0 million inactive mobile accesses in
the first quarter of 2012. Therefore, in comparable terms, the year on year decrease would have been
-14.9%, due to lower usage by customers, lower prices in the new rates portfolio, and reduction in
interconnection rates. Voice ARPU decreased 20.0% from 2011 to 2012, while data ARPU fell 0.4%,
the latter accounting for 31% of total ARPU. The growth in connectivity revenues, included in data
ARPU was not sufficient to completely offset the lower SMS revenues.

quarter of 2011 (2,591 million euros). Excluding such impact, the year-on-year decrease would be
11.1% due to the year-on-year decrease in revenues, partially offset by the sharp reduction of
commercial expenses through the new model eliminating subsidies and also personnel expenses
savings as a result of the workforce reduction plan approved in 2011.

2011 results

In 2011 the Spanish market was shaped by the economic downturn, with declines in the principal
macroeconomic indicators in the latter months of the year, and a fiercely competitive environment with
intense commercial pressure.

At the end of 2011, Telefonica Spain managed a total of 47.1 million accesses, nearly the same as in 2010
(-a 1% decline) despite heavy pressure from competitors. Against this backdrop, Telefonica Spain's
market share fell slightly.

Fixed broadband Internet accesses fell 2.0% in 2011 as our commercial strategy focused more on “value”
amid stiff competition, with a slowdown in promotional activity in certain months of the year before the
September launch of a new ADSL offer boosted activity and net adds in the latter part of the year.

Telefonica Spain took a number of steps during the course of the year focused on reducing its operating
costs (primarily the labor force reduction plan) and improving its competitive position. At the end of the
third quarter, the company launched its new services catalog, which promotes customer exclusivity by
offering cross discounts for customers whose entire telecommunications spend is with Movistar. The
company also completed the repositioning of its commercial offerings in the fourth quarter of 2011 with
the launch of new mobile rates for contract customers. The new rates combine voice, data and SMS
offerings, increasing value to customers by eliminating the voice rate structure that varied depending on

time of call and call destination and include unlimited SMS in all data tariffs. Rates are now structured by
usage in corresponding to the amount each customer wishes to spend. Also, in the fourth quarter of
2011, voice tariffs were streamlined for pre-pay customers with a highly competitive and flexible offer.

In the fixed line business, in the third quarter of 2011, Telefonica launched 10 mega ADSL with value-
added services at 24.90 euros per month, while in the fourth quarter of the year it enhanced its offerings
with a basic ADSL plan at 19.90 euros per month (excluding value-added services and fixed-to-mobile
calls). Value-added services packages enjoyed greater adoption during the year.

* Revenues fell 7.7% in 2011 to 17,269 million euros, pulled down by lower ARPU in the various
services and lower accesses amid waning consumption and stronger pricing pressure.

Revenues in the fixed line business decreased by 6.8% to 10,624 million euros, mostly because of
declines in revenues from traditional access of 10.6% (7% fall in accesses and lower amounts
recognized from universal service) a decrease in revenues from voice services of 9.0% (due to
reduction in traffic carried and the increasing weight of flat rates) and a 10.1% decrease in revenues
from retail broadband services (10.2% decrease in effective broadband ARPU due to lower effective
prices from the promotions carried out and the new prices launched in the latter part of the year).

Revenues from the mobile business decreased by 9.4% in 2011 to 7,739 million euros, due mainly
to the 10.0% fall in mobile service revenues (due to a 10% drop in ARPU -explained below- and
among a slightly reduced customer base).

Mobile traffic continued to reflect lower customer usage, falling 4.3% in 2011.

Total ARPU fell 10.2% in 2011 to 22.9 euros, undermined by a 15.7% fall in voice ARPU because of
the interconnection rates cuts, lower usage and downward pressure on retail prices. Conversely, data
ARPU rose 9.9% in 2011, representing 26% of total ARPU (+5 p.p.), fuelled by the rapid growth of
mobile broadband.

Non-P2P SMS revenues continue to be the biggest growth driver in the data business, increasing by
24.1% in 2011 and representing 75% of total data revenue (+8 p.p.). Data revenue had a solid
increase of 10.9% in 2011.

* — OIBDA in 2011 amounted to 5,095 million euros, down 40.2% from 2010 due to the negative impact
of expenses related to the labor force reduction plan. Excluding the workforce restructuring expenses
recognized (2,591 million euros in the third quarter of 2011 and 202 million euros in the fourth
quarter of 2010), OIBDA would have decreased by 12% in 2011, mostly due to the decline in
revenues.

In 2012, Telefonica UK had high commercial activity, thanks to the ongoing success of its "On&On"
smartphone rates. This has led to a solid net add in contract customers, shoring up the segmented data
rates strategy and contributing to keep churn extremely low.

Telefonica UK has prepared the commercial launch of 4G services in 2013, through a network sharing
agreement with Vodafone. This agreement is expected to shore up the current network collaboration,
expand coverage, and set the bases for the 4G network.

As aresult of the commercial strategy, in late 2012, Telefonica UK had a total of 23.8 million accesses (up
3.5% year-on-year), primarily drawing from the greater mobile customer base. This customer base grew
3.1% over the course of the year, standing at 22.9 million in December 2012. The contract segment is the
main lever for growth (up 8.8% year-on-year). In addition, the weight of contract customers raised 3 p.p.
from 2011 to 2012, accounting for 52% of mobile accesses. The steady demand for smartphones
increased the penetration of these handsets to 45% at the end of 2012, up from 38% the year before.

The company's strong operating performance in 2012, with solid net adds, is reflected in its financial
statements, with growth in revenues and higher year-on-year growth in OIBDA (see explanation of 2011
results for Germany). Telefonica Germany reported favorable trends in the OIBDA margin and growing
revenues, despite the new cuts in termination rates established in December 2012. As a result, the
company remains the third-largest integrated operator in the German market based on our internal
estimates of market share.

Telefonica Germany continues to gear its investment toward LTE mobile technology, with a view to
meeting future growth and ensuring one of the most advanced VDSL platforms in the country.

Telefonica Germany achieved a 3.6% increase in accesses in 2012, fuelled by 5.0% growth in mobile
accesses on the back of a 9.5% larger contact customer base. This strong contract customer net add
reflects the strong demand for integrated data mobile rates (“O2 Blue" rates").

Demand for smartphones remained strong in the year, raising mobile broadband penetration by 6 p.p. to
26% at December 31, 2012. This reflects the success of the "My Handy" handset distribution model, with
an increase in the number of pre-pay customers using smartphone handsets, as the unit cost of these
handsets is beginning to become attractive for those customers.

Revenue: Total revenue rose 3.5% year-on-year to 5,213 million euros, primarily due to strong
mobile revenues. Mobile services revenues increased by 7.0% year-on-year in 2012, drawing from
the expanded contract customer base and the success of limited-use data rates. As a result, the
30.7% year-on-year growth in non-P2P SMS data revenues continued to drive total data revenues.
Mobile data revenues were up 16.1% compared to 2011, representing 44% of mobile service
revenues (up 3 p.p. year-on-year).

Revenue from the fixed line service fell 4.4% from 2011 to 2012, due mainly to the decrease in fixed
broadband accesses.

Total ARPU was up 0.9% in the year. Voice ARPU decreased 5% year-on-year; however, this
decrease was offset by the strong data ARPU (up 9.3% compared to 2011), drawing from the greater
share in mobile broadband and the increased adoption of integrated rates among the customer base.

Revenues: Total revenue rose 4.3% in 2011 to 5,035 million euros. Revenues for 2010 included the
results of HanseNet as of mid-February 2010, while 2011 results included them for the full year.
Excluding this impact, revenue would have increased by 1.6% during 2011.

revenue growth (49%) was a key driver of revenue, leveraging the increasing penetration of
smartphones and the adoption of limited use data rates.

Total ARPU fell 7.8% in the year due to the sharp reduction in interconnection rates in December
2010. This impact accounted for 6.2 p.p. of the decrease. Excluding this impact, total ARPU would
have only declined 1.6% mainly due to the weak performance of the pre-pay segment. Regulatory
changes affected voice ARPU, with an 18.5% drop in the year. This was partly offset by the good
performance of data ARPU (up 13.2%) thanks to increasing mobile broadband penetration and
strong adoption of limited use data rates.

Mobile traffic increased 10% in 2011 due to growth in the customer base and an overall increase in
usage.

OIBDA increased 29.1% to 1,219 million euros in 2011. Excluding the impact of the consolidation of
HanseNet results from February 2010 and for 12 months in 2011 and the 202 million euros of
restructuring provisions recognized in 2010, OIBDA in 2011 would have increased by 4.9% primarily
due to higher revenues and efficiency gains achieved through the restructuring plan and other
efficiencies, which offset the increase in commercial costs.

Accesses in the Czech Republic increased 1.6% in 2012 due to growth in mobile and fixed broadband
accesses. The total mobile customer base rose 2.9% year-on-year, to 5.1 million customers at December
31, 2012. This increase was driven by the steady growth in the contract segment (up 4.7% from 2011),
which accounts for 63% of the total base (up 1 p.p. year-on-year). In Slovakia, the number of accesses

continued to rise, largely underpinned by the contract segment.

In respect of the 2012 performance of the fixed line telephone business:

- Fixed line telephone accesses stood at 1.5 million at the 2012 year end, for a net loss of 82
thousand customers during the course of the year.

- Retail broadband accesses continue to rise (up 7.1% year-on-year), to 899 thousand at December
31, 2012 (annual net add of 60 thousand accesses). VDSL continues to gain strength, with 260

thousand customers subscribing to this service (32% of the residential xDSL customer base).

- The number of pay TV customers reached 141 thousand at the 2012 year end (up 4.3% from

2011).

2012 results

Revenues in the Czech Republic and Slovakia amounted to 2,010 million euros, for a year-on-year
decrease of 3.7% in local currency. Mobile service revenues amounted to 1,097 million euros (down
2.4% year-on-year, in local currency), primarily reflecting weaker consumption across all segments
and the lower mobile interconnection rates (which accounted for 3.4 p.p. of the year-on-year
decline). When stripping out the impact of these rates cuts, mobile service revenues rose 1.0% from
2011 to 2012.

In Slovakia, revenue growth remained solid (up 22.1% compared to 2011), amounting to 192 million
euros.

Fixed line telephone revenues totaled 851 million euros (a 5.4% decrease from 2011), primarily due
to pressures on fixed ARPU.

OIBDA totaled 832 million euros, down 8.7% on 2011 in local currency. Pressure on revenues is the
main reason for this drop, as operating costs are nearly flat year on year despite customer base
growth and expansion of business activities. Efficiency measures have been implemented in both
commercial and non-commercial areas of its operations, with personnel expenses declining
significantly as a consequence of headcount reduction (excluding restructuring costs).

2011 results

Revenues in the Czech Republic and Slovakia amounted to 2,130 million euros, for a year-on-year
decrease of 3%. In Slovakia, growth in the customer base led to higher revenues in 2011.

OIBDA totaled 931 million euros in 2011, affected by major efficiency initiatives, sales of non-
strategic assets and wide margins in Slovakia, which resulted in a smaller decrease in OIBDA than in
revenue in the year.

Share price performance

The main European markets were severely affected by the performance of the debt markets in 2012. During
the first half of the year, rising risk premiums of countries in Southern Europe drove the Ibex 35 index down
to its lowest level since March 2003 on July 24, 2012, after the Spanish risk premium reached 627.7 points,
situating the Spanish ten-year bond yield at 7.5%. Despite this, during the latter half of the year, decisions
taken by the European Union and the statements of the Chairman of the ECB led to a gradual reduction in
the risk premium and the equities markets rebounded, ending 2012 with gains across Europe: EStoxx-
50 +13.8%; DAX +29.1%; CAC-40 +15.2%; FTSE-100 +5.8% and FTSEMIB: +7.8).

The Spanish ten-year bond yield closed 2012 at 5.2% (5.0% at year-end 2011), while the spread
compared to the German bond was 388.7 basis points (317.0 basis points at year-end 2011). This was
reflected in the performance of the Spanish stock market which, despite gains in the second half of the
year (+37% from lows in July), posted losses for the third consecutive year. The Ibex-35 index contracted
by 4.7% in 2012 affected by the euro zone crisis, the rising risk premium and doubts surrounding the
health of the financial sector.

Against this backdrop, Telefonica shares dropped by 23.9% (10.19 euros per share at year-end 2012),
having performed more poorly than the sector in Europe (-10.7%). Other European operators also
suffered declining share prices during the year: KPN: -59.8%; France Telecom: -31.3%; Telecom Italia: -
17.8%; PT: -15.8; Vodafone: -13.7%; Deutsche Telekom: -3,0%. The total return on Telefénica shares in
2012 was -17.8% (including the dividends distributed throughout 2012).

At the 2011 year end, Telefonica featured among the world's ten largest telecommunications company
by market cap (46,375 million euros).

Daily trading volume in Telefonica shares on Spain's continuous market was 42.9 million shares in 2012
(56.4 million shares in 2011).

Research, Development and Innovation

Telefonica remains firmly committed to technological innovation as an essential tool for achieving
competitive advantages, anticipating market trends and differentiating its products. By introducing new
technologies and developing new products and business processes, we seek to become a more effective,
efficient and customer-oriented Group.

Telefonica has developed an open innovation model for the management of technological innovation to
boost the application of technical research in the development of new commercial products and services.
Telefonica focuses on certain applied research and development (R&D) priorities that are aligned with its
strategy. Open innovation initiatives driving this model include the creation of a venture capital fund and
involvement in business collaboration forums, among others. The model also promotes the use of
knowledge developed at technology centers, universities and start-ups, among other sources, and
encourages innovation in conjunction with other agents (e.g. customers, universities, public
administrations, suppliers, content providers and other companies), making them “technological
partners.” Telefonica believes it cannot rely solely on acquired technology to differentiate its products
from those of its competitors and to improve its market positioning. It is also important to encourage
R&D initiatives in an effort to achieve this differentiation and make inroads in other innovation activities.
The Group's R&D policy is geared towards:

¢ developing new products and services in order to win market share;

* boosting customer loyalty;

¢ increasing revenue;

* enhancing innovation management;

¢ improving business practices;

* increasing the quality of infrastructure services to improve customer service and reduce costs;
* promoting global products;

* supporting open innovation; and

* creating value from the technology generated.

In 2012, the technological innovation projects undertaken focused on sustainable innovation, process
efficiency, creation of new revenue streams, customer satisfaction, consolidation of operations in new
markets and technological leadership.

Technical innovation activities are a key part of Telefonica's strategy of creating value through latest-
generation network communications and services.

In 2012, projects were undertaken to promote greater access to information technology, new services
focused on new internet business models, advanced user interfaces, mobile television and other
broadband services. These initiatives, among others, were undertaken based on our objective of rapidly
identifying emerging technologies that could have a relevant impact on our businesses and pilot testing
these technologies in new services, applications and platform prototypes.

Most of our R&D activities are carried out by Telefonica Investigacion y Desarrollo, S.A.U. (Telefonica I+D),
a wholly-owned subsidiary, which works mainly for the lines of business. In its operations, Telefonica I+D
receives the assistance of other companies and universities. Telefonica I+D's mission is centered on
enhancing the Company's competitive positioning by leveraging technological innovation and product
development. Telefonica I1+D undertakes experimental and applied research and new product

development with the overriding goal of broadening the range of services offered and reducing operating
costs.

Telefénica |+D's technological innovation activities focus on certain areas:

Telefonica |+D's works on new networks, primarily in collaboration with Telefonica's Global Resources
team. These activities are related with new radio access technologies (LTE-Advanced); network
virtualization technologies, in line with the technology trend known as software defined networks (SDN);
and network optimization and zero touch developments making networks more flexible and moldable
and able to adapt dynamically to new digital consumer and service requirements.

R&D activities to develop new products and services are conducted as part of Telefénica Digital's
strategy. Indeed, Telefonica I+D' forms the foundations of Telefonica Digital's Product Development &
Innovation Department. These activities include the following:

* Natural P2P communication of the future, using the Internet, Web 2.0 and smartphones.

* Video and multimedia services (combining text, audio, images and video) offering a user experience in
all connected devices.

¢ Advanced solutions in emerging ITC businesses such as e-health, and remote patient support or
monitoring.

* M2M (machine-to-machine) service management associated with energy efficiency and mobility.

¢ Making use of user communication profiles to exploit opportunities to operate different products and
business models (marketing campaigns, target marketing, contextual services, churn reduction, cross-
selling, etc.)

Telefénica |+D's also boasts scientific work groups with a more medium- to long-term focus and aim to
look into opportunities relating to new networks and services and solutions to the technological
challenges that arise.

At December 31, 2012, Telefonica |+D had 667 employees (653 employees in 2011).

Total I+D expense for 2012 amounted to 1,071 million euros, up 9% from the 983 million euros incurred
in 2011 (797 million euros in 2010). This expense represents 1.7%, 1.6% and 1.3% of the Group's
consolidated revenue for 2012,2011 and 2010, respectively. These figures were calculated using
guidelines of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Using these and
other guidelines, there are R&D costs that, due to the length of projects and/or accounting classifications,
are not entirely included in the consolidated statement of financial position.

In 2012, Telefonica registered 87 patents (95 patents in 2011), 78 of which were registered with the
Spanish Patent and Trademark Office and (OEPM for its initials in Spanish) and nine with the United
States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Of the patents pending with the OEPM, 45 are Spanish (ES)
applications, 29 European (EP) applications, and four international (PCT) applications.

maturity of the first edition of the Global Employee Share Plan (GESP). In December 2012, the second
phase of the GESP started, and 116,443 treasury shares were earmarked to meet the demand for shares
of employees that have adhered to this plan.

The sales for 2011 included 371 million euros in respect of the Strategic Partnership Agreement with
China Unicom.

Also in 2011, following the end of the third phase of the Performance Share Plan, a total of 2,446,104
treasury shares were added, corresponding to two derivative financial instruments arranged by the
Company to meet its obligations to deliver treasury shares to managers and executives. A net 2,900,189
shares (33 million euros) was finally delivered. The fourth phase expired on June 30, 2012, with no shares
being awarded.

At December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, Telefonica held 178 million, 190 million and 160 million purchase
options on treasury shares, subject to physical settlement.

The Company also has a derivative financial instrument on approximately 28 million Telefonica shares,
subject to net settlement, recognized under “Current financial assets” of the accompanying consolidated
statement of financial position (26 million euros recognized under “Current interest-bearing debt”).

Risks and uncertainties facing the company

The Telefonica Group's business is conditioned by a series of intrinsic risk factors that affect exclusively
the Group, as well as a series of external factors that are common to businesses of the same sector. The
main risks and uncertainties facing the Company which could affect its business, financial position and
results, are as follows:

Group-related risks
Country risk (investments in Latin America)

At December 31, 2012, approximately 48.9% of the Telefonica Group's revenue (approximately 49.6% of
its assets) is generated by the Latin American segment (primarily in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Chile
and Peru); 78.3% of those assets are generated in countries classified as investment grade (Brazil, Chile,
Peru, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay and Panama) by some of the credit rating agencies. The Telefonica
business is especially sensitive to any of the risks related to Latin America described in this section,
particularly if they affect or arise in Brazil, which at December 31, 2012 accounted for 50.6% of assets
and 44.6% of revenue from Latin American operations.

The Group's investments and operations in Latin America could be affected by a series of risks related to
economic, political and social factors in these countries, collectively denominated “country risk,”
including risks related to the following:

* government regulation or administrative polices may change unexpectedly, including changes
that modify the terms and conditions of licenses and concessions and their renewal (or delay
their approvals) which could negatively affect the Group's interests in such countries;

¢ the effects of inflation, currency depreciation or currency restrictions and other restraints on
transfer of funds may be imposed. For example, in Venezuela, the official US Dollar to Bolivar
fuerte exchange rate is established by the Central Bank of Venezuela and the Minister of Finance.
Additionally, the acquisition of foreign currencies by Venezuelan companies to pay foreign debt
or dividends is subject to the pre-authorization of the relevant Venezuelan authorities;

* governments may expropriate or nationalize assets or increase their participation in the
economy and companies; and

* economic downturns, political instability and civil disturbances may negatively affect the
Telefonica Group's operations in such countries.

Foreign currency and interest rate risk

The Telefonica Group's business is exposed to various types of market risks, above all the impact of
changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates.

At December 31, 2012, 23% of the Group's net debt was at floating rates, while 20% was denominated in
a currency other than the euro.

To illustrate the sensitivity of financial expenses to a change in short-term interest rates at December 31,
2012: (i) a 100 basis points increase in interest rates in all currencies in which Telefonica has a financial
position at that date would lead to an increase in financial expenses of 96 million euros, (ii) whereas a 100
basis points decrease in interest rates in all currencies except the euro, dollar and the pound sterling, in
order to avoid negative rates, would lead to a reduction in financial expenses of 36 million euros. These
calculations were made assuming a constant currency and balance position equivalent to the position at
that date and bearing in mind the derivative financial instruments arranged.

Telefnica,S.A. 251


--- Page 54 ---

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

As for the impact on the income statement, specifically exchange gains and losses in the financial result
at December 31, 2012, the impact of a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate would be 159
million euros (assuming a constant currency position with an impact on profit or loss at that date
including derivative instruments arranged and that Latin American currencies would fall against the US
dollar and the rest of the currencies against the euro by 10%).

The Telefonica Group uses a variety of strategies to manage this risk, mainly through the use of financial
derivatives, which themselves are also exposed to risk, including counterparty risk. Furthermore, the
Group's risk management strategies may not achieve the desired effect, which could adversely affect the
Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Dependence on external sources of financing

The performance, expansion and improvement of networks, the development and distribution of the
Telefonica Group's services and products, as well as the development and implementation of new
technologies or the renewal of licenses require a substantial amount of financing.

The performance of financial markets in terms of liquidity, cost of credit, access and volatility, continues
to be overshadowed by persisting uncertainty regarding certain factors such as the pace of economic
recovery, the health of the international banking system or the concerns regarding the burgeoning
deficits of some European countries. The worsening international financial market conditions caused by
some of these factors could make it more difficult and more expensive to refinance existing financial debt
(at December 31, 2012, gross maturities in 2013, including the net position in derivative financial
instruments, certain current payables and expected early redemptions amounted to around 10,074
million euros, or 9,574 million euros should Telefonica elect not to exercise expected early redemptions,
and in 2014 to 7,850 million euros) or arrange new debt if necessary, and more difficult and costly to
raise funds from our shareholders.

Furthermore, obtaining financing on the international capital markets could also be restricted (in terms of
access and cost) if Telefonica's credit ratings are revised downwards, either due to lower solvency or
operating performance, or as a result of a downgrade in the rating for Spanish sovereign risk by rating
agencies. Any of these situations could have a negative impact on our ability to honor our debts.

Moreover, market conditions could make it harder to renew existing undrawn bilateral credit lines, 18% of
which, at December 31, 2012, initially mature prior to December 31, 2013.

Risks related to the Company's industry
Current global economic situation

The Telefonica Group's business is impacted by general economic conditions in each of the countries in
which it operates. The uncertainty about whether economic recovery will continue may negatively affect
the level of demand from existing and prospective customers, as customers may no longer deem critical
the services offered by the Group. The main macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse impact
on consumption and, accordingly, demand for our services and the Telefonica Group's results include the
dearth of credit as banks adjust their balance sheets, trends in the labor market, further erosion of
consumer confidence, with an immediate increase in saving rates, or needs for greater fiscal adjustment,
which would undermine household income levels. This risk is higher in Europe, but less relevant in other
countries where the Telefonica Group operates.

Similarly, the sovereign debt crisis in certain euro-area countries and rating downgrades in some of these
countries should be taken into account. Any further deterioration in sovereign debt markets or greater
restrictions on credit in the banking sector could have an adverse impact on Telefénica's ability to raise
financing and/or obtain liquidity. This could have a negative effect on the Group's business, financial

Telefnica,S.A. 252

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, there could be other possible follow-on effects
from the economic crisis on the Group's business, including insolvency of key customers or suppliers.

Lastly, in Latin America, the exchange rate risk in Venezuela (as reflected by the recent currency
devaluation in February 2013) and Argentina (with a constant devaluation of the Argentinean peso
against U.S. dollar) exists in relation to the negative impact any unexpected weakening in their currencies
could have on cash flows from these countries. On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte was
devalued from 4.3 bolivar fuertes per U.S. dollar to 6.3 bolivar fuertes per U.S. dollar. The exchange-rate
situation of the Bolivar fuerte affects the estimates made by the Group of the net asset value of the
foreign currency position related to investments in Venezuela, which translates to an approximate pre-
tax loss of 438 million euros on the 2012 financial statements.

Highly regulated markets

As a multinational telecommunications company that operates in regulated markets, the Telefonica
Group is subject to different laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it provides services
and in which supranational regulators such as the European Union and national, state, regional and local
authorities intervene to varying degrees and as appropriate. This regulation is strict in the countries in
which the Company holds a significant market power position.

In Europe, wholesale mobile network termination rates came down in 2011. There were considerable
reductions in many of the countries where the Group operates, notably in the UK (with a final reduction
scheduled for 2015 and a decrease in prices of over 83% compared to the end of 2010) and Germany
(cuts of over 50% since December 2010). In Spain, the schedule for reducing mobile call termination rates
came into play on April 16, 2012, and the target price (1.09 euros) will be attained in July 2013, with a
decrease of approximately 75% in wholesale prices. Other countries where rates will fall as from 2012 are
the Czech Republic (slightly more than 49%), Ireland (approximately 72%) and Slovakia (approximately
58%).

Other services with regulated prices in Europe include call roaming, SMS and data services. The European
Parliament and Council has approved the new Roaming Ill regulation which replaces all previous
regulations. The objective of this Regulation is to set maximum prices for voice and SMS retail and
wholesale services between July 2012 and July 2014, which will then be progressively reduced. It also
regulates retail and wholesale data roaming charges for the first time.

Additionally, according to Roaming III, from July 2014, mobile operators would be forced to separate the
sale of roaming services from their domestic services. This would allow users to choose a different
operator for calls made in other Member States. Lastly, in relation to net neutrality, the new European
regulatory framework establishes as a general principle the importance of ensuring European citizens
have free internet access. Nevertheless, regulators could also adopt at any time measures or additional
requirements to reduce roaming prices and fixed and/or mobile termination rates, and force Telefonica to
provide third-party access to its networks.

Moreover, in Latin America there is tendency to review —and reduce— mobile network termination rates.
For instance, reductions of 61% and 60% have been approved in Mexico and Chile, respectively. In Brazil,
in October 2011, the regulator (Anatel) approved the fixed-mobile rate adjustment regulation, which
entails a gradual reduction of these rates through to 2014 by applying a CPl-factor, which results in a
reduction of approximately 29% in 2012-2014. The absolute decrease in public rates must be passed on
to mobile interconnection rates (VU-M). In addition, there is a trend towards reductions in termination
rates in Peru, Venezuela and Colombia.

The new regulatory principles established in Europe's common regulatory framework, adopted in 2009
and transposed in the national legislation of each Member State in which Telefonica operated during
2011 and 2012 could result in increased regulatory pressure on the local competitive environment.
Specifically, this framework supports the possibility of national regulators, in specific cases and under

Telefonica,S.A. 253

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

exceptional conditions, establishing the functional separation between the wholesale and retail
businesses of operators with significant market power and vertically integrated operators, whereby they
would be required to offer equal wholesale terms to third-party operators that acquire these products.

The recommendation on the application of the European regulatory policy to next-generation broadband
networks drawn up by the European Commission (EC) could also play a key role in the incentives for
operators to invest in net fixed broadband networks in the short-term and medium-term, thus affecting
the outlook for the business and competition in this market segment. Nonetheless, the EC is currently
drafting respective recommendations on cost accounting and non-discrimination, and it is expected that
these recommendations, which will affect the earlier recommendation, will be approved in mid-2013.
According to statements by Commissioner Kroes, initial evaluations are that the Commission could make
the regulation for new generation networks more flexible in exchange for stricter measures on new
operators concerning non-discrimination.

Meanwhile, as the Group provides most of its services under licenses, authorizations or concessions, it is
vulnerable to economic fines for serious breaches and, ultimately, revocation or failure to renew these
licenses, authorizations or concessions or the granting of new licenses to competitors for the provisions
of services in a specific market.

The Telefonica Group pursues their renewal to the extent provided by the contractual conditions, though
it cannot guarantee that it will always complete this process successfully or under the most beneficial
terms for the Group. In many cases it must satisfy certain obligations, including, among others, minimum
specified quality standards, service and coverage conditions and capital investment. Failure to comply
with these obligations could result in fines or even revocation or forfeiture of the license, authorization or
concession.

Additionally, the Telefonica Group could be affected by regulatory actions carried out by antitrust of
competition authorities. These authorizations could prohibit certain actions, such as new acquisitions or
specific practices, create obligations or lead to heavy fines. Any such measures implemented by the
competition authorities could results in economic and/or reputational loss for the Group, in addition to a
loss of market share and/or in harm to the future growth of certain businesses.

Highly competitive markets and markets subject to constant technological development

The Telefonica Group operates in markets that are highly competitive and subject to constant
technological development. Therefore, it is subject to the effects of actions by competitors in these
markets and its ability to anticipate and adapt to constant technological changes taking place in the
industry.

To compete effectively, the Telefonica Group needs to successfully market its products and services and
respond to both commercial actions by competitors and other competitive factors affecting these
markets, anticipating and adapting promptly to technological changes, changes in consumer preferences
and general economic, political and social conditions. Failure to do so appropriately could have an adverse
impact on the Group's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

New products and technologies arise constantly, while the development of existing products and
technologies can render obsolete the products and services the Telefonica Group offers and the
technology it uses. This means that Telefénica must invest in the development of new products,
technology and services so it can continue to compete effectively with current or future competitors, and
which may result in the decrease of the Group's revenue margins. In this respect, margins from traditional
voice and data business are shrinking, while new sources of revenues are deriving from mobile internet
and connectivity services that are being launched. Research and development costs amounted to 1,071
million euros and 983 million euros in 2012 and 2011, respectively, representing 1.7% and 1.6% of the
Group's consolidated revenue, respectively.

Telefonica,S.A. 254

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

One technology that telecommunications operators, including Telefonica (in Spain and Latin America),
are focused on is the new FTTx-type network, which offers broadband access using optical fiber with
superior services, e.g. internet speed of up to 100mb or HD television services. However, substantial
investment is required to deploy these networks, which entails fully or partially substituting copper loop
access with optic fiber. As things stand today, scant demand for the capabilities offered by these new
networks to end users could make it difficult to quantify the return on investment and justify the high
investment.

In addition, many of the aforementioned works directed to network upgrade and to offer new products or
services are not entirely under the Telefonica Group's control and could be constrained by applicable
regulation.

Limitations on spectrum capacity could be costly and curtail growth.

Telefonica’s mobile operations in a number of countries may rely on the availability of spectrum. The
Company's failure to obtain sufficient or appropriate spectrum capacity or its capacity to assume the
related costs, could have an adverse impact on the quality on the launching and provision of new services
and on the Companys ability to maintain the quality of existing services, which may adversely affect the
Group's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows

In 2012, Telefonica Ireland invested 127 million euros to obtain spectrum in the 800, 900 and 1800 MHz
bands. On February 20, 2013, Telefonica UK was granted two blocks of 10 MHz in the 800 MHz spectrum
band for the rollout of a nationwide 4G network, total investment was of approximately 645 million
euros. Meanwhile, in 2012, an investment was made in spectrum capacity in Nicaragua amounting to 5
million euros. In Brazil, Vivo was awarded a block of band with “X” of 2500 MHz (20+20 MHz), including
the 450 MHz band in certain states in 2012. In Venezuela, in August 2012, a concession agreement was
signed between Telefonica Venezuela and the regulator for the additional 20 MHz in the 1900 MHz
frequency that had been granted to this company. Also in August 2012, Telefonica Moviles Chile, S.A. was
awarded radiofrequencies for 4G technology. As regards new spectrum allocations in the countries where
the Telefonica Group operates, in 2013 we are expecting auctions to take place in Slovakia, Colombia and
Uruguay.

Supplier failures

As a mobile and fixed telephony operator and provider of telecommunications services and products, the
Telefonica Group, like other companies in the industry, depends upon a small number of major suppliers
for essential products and services, mainly network infrastructure and mobile handsets. Telefonica Group
depends on 13 handset suppliers and five network infrastructure suppliers, which together accounted for
80% of orders in 2012. These suppliers may, among other things, extend delivery times, raise prices and
limit supply due to their own shortages and business requirements.

If these suppliers fail to deliver products and services to the Telefonica Group on a timely basis, it could
jeopardize network deployment and expansion plans, which in some cases could adversely affect the
Telefonica Group's ability to satisfy its license terms and requirements or have an adverse impact on the
Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Risks associated with unforeseen network interruptions

Unanticipated network interruptions as a result of system failures, including those due to network,
hardware or software or cyber-attacks, which affect the quality of or cause an interruption in the
Telefonica Group's service, could lead to customer dissatisfaction, reduced revenues and traffic, costly
repairs, penalties or other measures imposed by regulatory authorities and could harm the Telefonica
Group's reputation.

Telefonica,S.A. 255


--- Page 58 ---

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

Telefonica attempts to mitigate these risks through a number of measures, including backup systems
and protective systems such as firewalls, virus scanners and other physical and logical security. However,
these measures are not always effective. Although the Telefonica Group has insurance policies to cover
this type of incidents and risks, these policies may not be sufficient to cover all possible monetary losses,
although the claims and loss in revenue caused by service interruptions to date have been covered by
these policies.

Electromagnetic radio emissions and possible health risks

Currently, there is significant public concern regarding alleged potential effects of electromagnetic fields,
emitted by mobile telephones and base stations, on human health. This social concern has caused certain
governments and administrations to take measures that have hindered the deployment of the
infrastructures necessary to ensure quality of service and affected the deployment criteria of new
networks.

In May 2011, the specialized cancer research body of the World Health Organization (IARC) classified the
electromagnetic fields in mobile telephony as “possibly carcinogenic,” a classification which also includes
products such as coffee and pickled foods. The World Health Organization subsequently indicated, in its
fact sheet no. 193 published in June 2011, that to date it cannot be confirmed that the use of a mobile
telephone has adverse effects on health.

The most recent official study (to the best of our knowledge), published in 2012 by Advisory Group on
Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR), concludes that there are not convincing evidences showing that mobile
phone technologies cause adverse effects in the health of individuals. It cannot be certain that future
reports and medical studies establish a link between the electromagnetic signals or emissions of radio
frequencies and health problems.

Irrespective of the scientific evidence that may be obtained and even though the Telefonica Group has
considered these risks and has an action plan for the various countries in which it provides services to
ensure compliance with codes of good practice and relevant regulations, this concern, may affect the
capacity to capture or retain customers, discourage the use of mobile telephones, or lead to legal costs
and other expenses.

Society's worries about radiofrequency emissions could reduce the use of mobile telephones, which could
cause the public authorities to implement measures restricting where transmitters and cell sites can be
located and how they operate, and the use of our mobile devices, telephones and other products using
mobile technology. This could lead to the Company being unable to expand or improve its mobile
network. Furthermore, if any relevant authorities request that the thresholds of exposure to
electromagnetic fields be reduced, the Company may have to invest in reconstructing its network to
comply with these guidelines.

The adoption of new measures by governments or administrations or other regulatory interventions in
this respect that may also arise in the future may adversely affect the Group's business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Risk of asset impairment

The Telefonica Group reviews on an annual basis, or more frequently when the circumstances require it,
the value of assets and cash-generating units, to assess whether their carrying values can be supported
by the future expected cash flows, including, in some cases synergies allowed for in acquisition cost.
Potential changes in the regulatory, business, economic or political environment may result in the need
to introduce changes to estimates made and recognize impairment losses in goodwill, intangible assets or
fixed assets.

Telefonica,S.A. 256


--- Page 59 ---

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

Although the recognition of impairments of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and
financial assets results in a non-cash charge on the income statement, it could adversely affect the
results of the Telefonica Group's operations. In this respect, the Telefonica Group has experienced
impairment losses on certain of its investments, affecting the results of the year in which they were
made. In 2012, an impairment loss was recognized on the stake in Telco, S.p.A. which, coupled with the
impact of the recovery of all the operational synergies considered at the time of the investment and the
profit contribution for the year, resulted in a negative impact of 1,277 million euros. In 2012, an
impairment loss in goodwill was recognized amounting to 414 million euros for Telefonica operations in
Ireland which, combined with the write-off of the intangible asset associated with the customer portfolio
allocated to this market, resulted in a negative impact of 527 million euros.

Risks associated with internet

Our internet access and hosting services may involve us in civil liability for illegal or illicit use of the
internet. In addition, Telefonica, like all telecommunications services providers, may be held liable for the
loss, release or inappropriate modification of the customer data stored on its services or carried by its
networks

In most countries in which Telefonica operates, the provision of its internet access and hosting services
(including the operation of websites with shelf-generated content) are regulated under a limited liability
regime applicable to the content that it makes available to the public as a technical service provider,
particularly content protected by copyright or similar laws. However, regulatory changes have been
introduced imposing additional obligations on access providers (such as. blocking access to a website) as
part of the struggle against some illegal or illicit uses of the internet, notably in Europe.

Other risks
Litigation and other legal proceedings

Telefonica and Telefonica Group companies are party to lawsuits and other legal proceedings in the
ordinary course of their businesses, the financial outcome of which is unpredictable. An adverse outcome
or settlement in these or other proceedings could result in significant costs and may have a material
adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Telefonica,S.A. 257

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

Trend evolution

Telefonica is an integrated diversified telecommunications group that offers a wide range of services,
mainly in Europe and Latin America. Its core business is the provision of fixed and mobile telephony,
broadband, internet, data, pay TV and value added services, among others. The Group's operations in 25
countries, managed through a regional organization geared towards certain businesses in global units,
enable it to leverage the strong local positioning, as well as the advantages afforded by the scale, two
features that have been reinforced by the opportunities arising from the Group's holdings in and strategic
alliances with China Unicom and Telecom Italia.

As a multinational telecommunications company that operates in regulated markets, Telefonica is
subject to different laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it provides services.
Telefonica expects the regulatory landscape to continue to change in Europe as a consequence of the
revised regulations resulting from the implementation of the review of the common regulatory
framework currently in place in the European Union. In addition, Telefonica may also face pressure from
regulatory initiatives in some European countries regarding tariffs, the reform of rights of spectrum use
and allocation, issues related to the quality of service, and the regulatory treatment of new broadband
infrastructure deployments.

Telefonica faces intense competition in the vast majority of the markets it operates in, and is therefore
subject to the effects of actions taken by its competitors. The intensity of the competition may deepen,
which could have an impact on tariff structures, consumption, market share and commercial activity and
negatively affect the number of customers, revenues and profitability.

However, Telefonica believes that it is in a strong competitive position in most of the markets where it
operates, which it expects to help enable it to continue taking advantage of the growth opportunities that
arise in these markets, such as by boosting both fixed and mobile broadband services and by furthering
the development of services beyond connectivity, information technology services and related
businesses. In this respect, Telefonica seeks to lead the industry by anticipating trends in the new digital
environment.

Telefonica embarked on a restructuring in September 2011 with the aim of reinforcing its growth story,
actively participating in the digital world and capturing the most of the opportunities afforded by its scale
and industrial alliances. This new organization gave rise to two cross-cutting areas, Telefonica Digital and
Telefonica Global Resources, in addition to the Telefonica Europe and Telefonica Latin America business
segments. This structure should bolster Telefénica’s place in the digital world, enabling it to tap any
growth opportunities arising in this environment, drive innovation, strengthen the product and services
portfolio and maximize the advantages afforded by its global customer bases in an increasingly
connected world. In addition, the creation of a Global Resources operating unit ensures the profitability
and sustainability of the business by leveraging economies of scale and driving Telefonica's
transformation into a fully global company. Telefonica Europe's and Telefonica Latin America’s objective
is to shore up the results of the business and generate sustainable growth through available capacity,
backed by the Global Corporation.

In Europe, customers remain at the core of the Group's strategy and management priorities in the region
in order to provide a high level of customer satisfaction with our services. With the objective of offering
our customers the best value, we aim to boost the mobile broadband services, adding new products and
services to our current services. In such a competitive market such as presently prevails, we will dedicate
our efforts on reinforcing our market positioning. Another objective in coming years is to improve
operating efficiency, for which we are rolling out several local and regional initiatives, such as network
sharing agreements, with the support of Telefonica Global Resources.

In Telefonica Europe, in Spain, a transformation strategy was kicked off half way through 2011 to
improve the Company's competitive position in the market and boost the efficiency of its business

Telefonica,S.A. 258

Selefonica 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements

model. This strategy has led to major changes in the sales and operating model, such as improvements to
the value proposition and service quality by the end of 2011 through the launch of a new tariff portfolio,
the elimination of subsidies to attract customers in March 2012, and the launch of Movistar Fusién
(convergent offer meeting all home communication needs). Telefonica will continue to focus on service
quality, improving the effectiveness of campaigns in the sales channel, and further increasing network
quality and characteristics (by developing fiber optics). The aim of this strategy is to boost customer
satisfaction by offering them a portfolio of products and services that best meets their communication
needs.

In Latin America, Telefonica’s strategy is based on a regional model that captures growth and efficiency
of scale without losing sight of the local management of the client. Telefonica expects the mobile
business to continue to play a fundamental role as an engine of regional growth. That is why we will
continue to improve the capacity and coverage of our networks, adapting our distribution channel to
enhance the quality of our offerings both in voice and data in order to keep and attract high-value
customers. Regarding the fixed telephony business, we will encourage the increase of broadband speed
and expand the supply of bundled services. Meanwhile, we will further advance efficiency, in operational
and commercial terms, and attempt to achieve further synergies by implementing global, regional and
local projects.

In summary, in the context of intense competition and regulatory pressure on pricing, Telefonica aims to
continue strengthening its business model to make it more efficient and capture the synergies arising
from the integrated approach of businesses, processes and technologies, while focusing even more on
the client and staying ahead of trends in the new digital world.
