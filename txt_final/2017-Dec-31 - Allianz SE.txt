BUSINESS OPERATIONS

Allianz Group structure

Allianz SE and its subsidiaries (the Allianz Group) offer property-
casualty insurance, life/health insurance, and asset management
products and services in over 70 countries, with the largest of our
operations located in Europe. The Allianz Group insures 88.0 million
customers. Allianz SE, the parent company of the Allianz Group, has
its headquarters in Munich, Germany.

The Allianz Group's structure reflects both our business segments
and geographical regions. Business activities are organized by prod-
uct and type of service, based on how these are strategically man-
aged: insurance activities, asset management activities, and corpo-
rate and other activities. Due to differences in the nature of products,
risks, and capital allocation, insurance activities are further divided
into property-casualty and life/health categories. In accordance with
the responsibilities of the Board of Management, each of the insur-
ance categories is grouped into regional reportable segments. Cor-
porate and other activities are divided into three different reportable
segments in order to differentiate between the respective products,
risks, and capital allocation. In 2017, the Allianz Group had 14 re-
portable segments.

Insurance operations

We offer a wide range of property-casualty and life/health insurance
products to both retail and corporate customers. For the Property-
Casualty business segment, these include motor, accident, property,
general liability, travel insurance and assistance services; the
Life/Health business segment offers savings and investment-oriented
products in addition to life and health insurance. We are the leading
property-casualty insurer worldwide and rank among the top five in
the life/health insurance business*. Our key markets (in terms of pre-
miums) for both property-casualty and life/health are Germany,
France, Italy, and the United States.

{For further information on organizational changes, please refer to the Executive Summary of 2017 Results,

Most of our insurance markets are served by local Allianz com-
panies. However, some business lines — such as Allianz Global Corpo-
rate & Specialty (AGCS), Allianz Partners (AP) (formerly Allianz
Worldwide Partners) and Credit Insurance — are run globally.

Asset Management

Our two major investment management businesses, PIMCO and
AllianzGl, operate under Allianz Asset Management (AAM). We are
one of the largest asset managers in the world that actively manage
assets. Our offerings cover a wide range of equity, fixed income, and
alternative investment products and solutions. Our core markets here
are the United States, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom,
and the Asia-Pacific region.

Corporate and Other

The Corporate and Other business segment's activities include the
management and support of the Allianz Group’s businesses through
its central holding functions, as well as Banking and Alternative In-
vestments.

HOLDING & TREASURY

Holding & Treasury manages and supports the Group’s businesses
through its strategy, risk, corporate finance, treasury, financial report-
ing, controlling, communication, legal, human resources, technology,
and other functions.

BANKING

Our banking operations, which place a primary focus on retail clients,
support our insurance business and complement the products we
offer in Germany, Italy, France, and Bulgaria. The sale of Olden-
burgische Landesbank AG was closed on 7 February 2018. Hence, we
now no longer have banking operations in Germany.

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS

Alternative Investments provides global alternative investment man-
agement services in the private equity, real estate, renewable energy,
and infrastructure sectors, mostly on behalf of our insurance opera-
tions.

BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
Allianz SE has a divisional Board structure based on functional and
business responsibilities. Business-related divisions reflect our busi-
ness segments Property-Casualty, Life/Health, Asset Management,
and Corporate and Other. In 2017 they were overseen by five Board
members. The remaining four divisions (i.e. Chairman of the Board of
Management, Finance, Investments, and Operations?) focus on
Group functions, along with business-related responsibilities.

For further information on Board of Management members and
their responsibilities, please refer to Mandates of the Members of the
Board of Management on () page 10.

TARGET SETTING AND MONITORING

The Allianz Group steers its operating entities and business segments
via an integrated management and control process. It begins with
the definition of a business-specific strategy and goals, which are
discussed and agreed upon between the Holding and operating
entities. Based on this strategy, our operating entities prepare three-
year plans which are then aggregated to form the financial plans for
the business divisions and for the Allianz Group as a whole. This plan
also forms the basis for our capital management. The Supervisory
Board approves the plan and sets corresponding targets for the
Board of Management. The performance-based remuneration of the
Board of Management is linked to short-term, mid-term, and long-
term targets to ensure effectiveness and emphasize sustainability. For
further details about our remuneration structure, including target
setting and performance assessment, please refer to the Remunera-

We continuously monitor our business performance against
these targets through monthly reviews — which cover key operational
and financial metrics — to ensure we can move quickly and take ap-
propriate measures in the event of negative developments. The Alli-
anz Group uses operating profit and net income as key financial
performance indicators across all its business segments. Other indica-
tors include segment-specific figures, such as the combined ratio for
Property-Casualty, return on equity? for Life/Health, and the cost-
income ratio for Asset Management. To steer and control new busi-
ness in our business segments Property-Casualty and Life/Health, we
use Return on Risk Capital (RoRC). We also use new business margins
for Life/Health. For a comprehensive view of our business segment
refer to the chapters from

Besides performance steering, we also have a risk steering pro-
cess in place, which is described in the Risk and Opportunity Report

Non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs) are mainly used
for the sustainability assessment that we conduct when determining

Our Corporate Responsibility approach

Allianz seeks to position itself as the world’s most trusted financial
services provider and a global sustainability leader. As such, we strive
to create sustainable economic value through a long-term approach
to corporate governance, social responsibility, and environmental
stewardship.

In 2017, we took the leading position among all rated insurance
companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) ranking,
scoring 87 out of 100 points. The DJS! ranks companies according to
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria, assessing their
strategy and performance.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE
Strong corporate governance is pivotal to our sustainability approach
and features among our most important material issues.

Established in 2012, the Group ESG Board is the highest govern-
ing body for sustainability-related issues. It consists of three Allianz SE
Board members and several department heads. They meet quarterly
and are responsible for ensuring ESG integration across all business
lines as well as all core processes dealing with insurance and invest-
ment decisions. Key topics of focus in 2017 included implementation
of the recommendations of the Taskforce of Climate-related Financial
Disclosures and development of a more systematic approach to
investor engagement.

The Group ESG Board is in charge of corporate responsibility and
climate-related topics, and leads on associated stakeholder en-
gagement. Functional departments provide regular updates on
sustainability issues directly to the Group ESG Board.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY APPROACH
We want our stakeholders to know that Allianz is a financially solid
and trustworthy company that embraces sustainable business as
good business. To achieve this, we also need to understand our
stakeholders’ needs and concerns, which is why we engage with a
broad range of social and political players and organizations. The
insight they provide enables us to focus our Corporate Responsibility
strategy, activities, and reporting on the right areas.

We organize our Corporate Responsibility strategy around three
focus areas in which we address the relevant material issues that our
stakeholders perceive as vital for business success and sustainability:

Low-carbon economy: supporting renewable energy and decarbon-
ization through our investments; providing sustainable insurance
solutions; reducing our environmental footprint.

Social inclusion: supporting the social inclusion of children and
youth through our Future Generations program; developing solutions

for customers in emerging markets; promoting diversity and wellbe-
ing among our employees.

Business integration: integrating environmental, social, and govern-
ance (ESG) issues across our investment and insurance businesses;
building trust through transparency, responsible sales, and data
privacy.

For reporting purposes, we organize our approach around Allianz’s
five key roles as a sustainable insurer, responsible investor, trusted
company, attractive employer, and committed corporate citizen.

Allianz SE and Allianz Group comply with the legal requirements to
provide a non-financial statement and a non-financial Group state-

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

Economic environment 20171

In terms of real economic growth, 2017 has been the best year for the
global economy since 2011. Around the globe, many countries expe-
rienced a fairly strong cyclical upswing. Two factors drove much of
last year’s positive development: the comeback of global trade and
the expansionary credit cycle. In the United States, economic momen-
tum increased in the course of 2017. Given the upturn in business
investment as well as the rebound in exports, economic activity was
on a broader footing than it had been in 2016. All in all, the U.S.
economy expanded by about 2.3%. With an increase of 2.5%, growth
in the Eurozone was slightly stronger than in the United States. The
recovery gained more breadth both in terms of countries and de-
mand components. The German economy expanded by 2.5% (in
calendar-adjusted terms), increasingly supported by rising investment
activity. In the emerging markets, growth finally reaccelerated in
2017, not least owing to continued stabilization in former recession
countries such as Brazil and Russia. Overall, the global economy
grew by an estimated 3.2%, considerably stronger than in 2016, when
global output rose by 2.6%.

World economy and financial markets appeared to overlook the
elevated global political uncertainties, at least in part. Stock market
volatility was low. On the monetary policy front, in October the Euro-
pean Central Bank announced that it would extend its monthly bond
purchasing program at least until the end of September 2018. In the
United States, the Federal Reserve continued to normalize its mone-
tary policy stance. It increased the federal funds rate range three
times by 25 basis points, bringing it to 125% — 1.5%. Moreover, in
October the Federal Reserve started a balance sheet normalization
program. Yields on 10-year German government bonds reached
04% at year-end 2017, 20 basis points higher than at the end of
2016. Spreads on Eurozone government bonds ended the year more
or less unchanged — with two major exceptions, Greece and Portugal,
where bond spreads tightened substantially. The performance of
major stock markets was clearly positive around the globe, with a
number of indices reaching new all-time highs. Supported by improv-
ing economic conditions in the Eurozone, the Euro appreciated con-
siderably against the U.S. Dollar in the course of 2017. The U.S. Dollar-
to-Euro exchange rate was 1.20 at year-end (end of 2016: 1.05).

Business environment 2017 for the insurance
industry

2017 was a mixed year for the insurance industry. On the one hand,
the global economy gained momentum, supporting top-line growth
across almost all regions and business lines. On the other hand, inter-
est rates remained low, putting relentless pressure on investment
returns. Above all, however, 2017 was a year of extreme natural
catastrophes: Insured losses from natural catastrophes reached a
new peak, almost tripling the previous year’s figure. Losses were

Environment was final. Also, please note that the information provided inthis chapter is based on our estimates.

C_ Group Management Report

heavily concentrated in North America, however, where we experi-
enced hurricanes (both in the United States and the Caribbean),
wildfires in the United States, and earthquakes in Mexico, while in
other regions, notably Asia and Europe, losses from natural catastro-
phes were less severe.

At the same time, the deep transformation of the business envi-
ronment, much of which is driven by the digital revolution, continued
unabatedly. For the insurance industry, it brings enormous challenges
but also new opportunities. While overhauling the current business
model requires sizeable resources, new technologies have helped
insurers achieve quantum leaps in terms of customer centricity, prod-
uct accessibility, and ease of doing business. Moreover, harnessing
new technologies expanded the scope of insurance solutions offered
to a wider range of threats, from cyber-attacks to health protection in
emerging countries.

In the property-casualty sector, premium growth accelerated slightly
in almost all markets, reflecting the broad-based recovery of the
global economy. This general uptick in growth did not, however,
change the growth differentials between regions: While Western
Europe lagged, Emerging Asia powered ahead, with the two biggest
markets, China and India, registering double-digit growth. Overall
and at a global scale, premiums rose by an estimated 5% in 2017,
after a 4% gain in 2016 (in nominal terms and adjusted for foreign
currency translation effects). Global industry profitability declined in
2017, mainly due to the large losses from natural catastrophes expe-
rienced in the United States; but soft underwriting conditions in many
business lines and low investment yields did not help either.

In the life sector, performance in the different regions was more
mixed. While, for example, the U.S. market had to cope with lower
premium growth, growth in Western Europe was on the up (albeit
from a low base). Emerging markets, too, showed diverging growth
trends: Eastern Europe experienced a rebound, Latin America a de-
cline. Meanwhile, Emerging Asia remained unfazed and simply con-
tinued to show double-digit growth, with China leading the pack,
clocking premium growth of around 20%. Government policies boost-
ing demand played a quite significant role in this growth story. Over-
all and at a global scale, premiums rose by an estimated 5% in 2017
(in nominal terms and adjusted for foreign currency translation ef-
fects). Global industry profitability remained challenging as the low
yield environment continued in 2017. On the other hand, market
volatility was generally low and stock markets performed very well.
Against this backdrop, insurers aligned their business model in several
ways: by reallocating assets (towards riskier and/or less liquid asset
classes), restructuring insurance portfolios (towards less capital inten-
sive business lines) and through in-force management actions (such
as life book disposals).

‘C_ Group Management Report

Business environment 2017 for the asset
management industry

As the global economy continued growing, 2017 also was an excel-
lent year for equity markets. Leading indices showed a very strong
performance. Especially U.S. equities rallied toward year-end, fueled
by the anticipation of a corporate tax reform.

The global fixed-income market also enjoyed strong returns in
2017, driven by the U.S. bond market. The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank
continued to gradually move away from its accommodative mone-
tary policy and increased the federal funds rate in three steps. At the
same time, the difference between short- and longer-dated USS.
Treasury yields declined significantly. In Europe, yields for 10-year
German government bonds increased slightly in the course of the
year, while the European Central Bank maintained its accommoda-
tive monetary policy.

The favorable developments in global capital markets also stim-
ulated fund flows in the asset management industry. This was par-
ticularly true for the United States, where the long-term inflows for the
year strongly outweighed the outflows. Taxable bond funds — both
actively and passively managed - profited most from these U.S. net
inflows, reflecting a shift from equities into fixed-income products.
Strong net inflows were also recorded for international equities in the
United States (both active and passive). Finally, U.S. equities also saw
net inflows — largely due to passively managed funds, while actively
managed equities experienced net outflows for the year. Overall,
investor preference continued to show a trend towards passive prod-
ucts in 2017; active managers, however, did well in several market
segments. In Europe, long-term net flows for 2017 reached a record
high. In Germany, net inflows to mutual funds mainly went into multi-
asset funds, followed by fixed-income products and equities.

Earnings summary

MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF 2017 RESULTS

Our total revenues increased by 5.0% on an internal basis’, com-
pared to 2016. A large part of the increase came from our Life/Health
business segment; it was due to both stronger sales of capital-
efficient products in Germany and higher unit-linked premiums in Italy
and Taiwan. Internal premium growth in our Property-Casualty busi-
ness segment was largely driven by Allianz Partners, Germany, and
Brazil. Revenue growth in our Asset Management business segment
was driven by higher third-party assets under management (AuM)
driven fees.

Our operating investment result decreased by € 1,352 mn to
€ 23,923 mn, mainly due to lower realized gains on debt securities.
This was partly offset by lower impairments.

Our operating profit increased by 0.4% compared to 2016 and
was in the upper half of our 2017 target range. Our Asset Manage-
ment business segment saw a strong increase in operating profit,
mostly due to higher AuM-driven fees thanks to third-party net in-
flows. The operating profit in our Life/Health business segment in-
creased due to a number of factors, including an improved technical
margin in France and higher unit-linked management fees in Italy.
The operating result in our Corporate and Other business segment
also improved across all three reportable segments. Our Property-

Casualty business segment experienced higher claims from natural
catastrophes, resulting in a decline in operating profit. A lower in-
vestment result also contributed to the decrease.

Our non-operating result decreased by €306mn to a loss of
€949 mn. Non-operating realized gains (net) declined as a result of
portfolio rebalancing actions in 2016. Impairments decreased as the
prior year had included impairment losses on the South Korean

cludes the recognition of a liability in connection with the expected
loss from the sale of Oldenburgische Landesbank AG””.

Income taxes decreased by € 144 mn to € 2,941 mn, mostly due
to tax benefits related to previous years and a lower valuation al-
lowance of deferred tax assets. These effects were partly offset by a
one-time expense that resulted from the revaluation of deferred
taxes following U.S. tax reform. The effective tax rate fell to 29.0%
(2016: 29.6%).

The lower non-operating result could only be partly offset by the
lower income taxes, resulting in an overall decrease in net income.

2017, Allianz SE purchased approximately 16.8 million own shares as
part of its share-buy-back program announced in February 2017 with
a total volume of € 3.0 bn.? Over the same period, our Solvency Il
capitalization ratio increased to 229% (includes share buy-back).

RECENT ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES
Effective 1 January 2017, the Allianz Group reorganized the structure
of its insurance activities to reflect the changes in the Board of Man-
agement responsibilities. The former reportable segment Asia Pacific
was allocated to the reportable segment Western & Southern Eu-
rope, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific. Any previously reported infor-
mation has been adjusted to reflect this change in reportable seg-
ments.

In addition, there were some minor reallocations between the
reportable segments.

10_As of 31 December 2017, all requirements were stil fulfilled to present Oldenburgische Landesbank AG, Oldenburg,
allocated to the reportable segment Banking (Corporate and Other) as a aisposal group clasiied as held for sole. The
closing of the transaction was nearly completed as of 31 December 2017. Therefore, an impairment and a lablty of
£€ 238 mn were recognized in connection with the expected loss from the sale ofthe Oldenburgische Landesbank AG
The Allianz shares in Oldenburgische Landesbank AG were transferred to the buyer on 7 February 2018. For further
information, please refer to nate 3 to the consolidated financial statements

Gross premiums written®

On a nominal basis, we recorded an increase in gross premiums
written compared to the previous year.

This includes unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of
€ 693 mn’ and positive (de)consolidation effects of € 225 mn. On an
internal basis, our premiums went up 2.3%, driven by a positive price
effect of 1.2% and a positive volume effect of 1.1%.

The following operations contributed positively to internal growth:

Allianz Partners: Gross premiums grew to € 4,608 mn — an in-
crease of 10.8% on an internal basis. It was driven by our U.S. travel
business and our health insurance business in Dubai.

Germany: Gross premiums amounted to € 10,074 mn. This inter-
nal growth of 1.7% was mainly due to positive price effects in our
motor and commercial property insurance business.

Brazil: Gross premiums went up 16.8% on an internal basis and
reached € 1,029 mn. This was mainly driven by our motor insurance
business.

Spain: Gross premiums increased to € 2,376 mn — up 4.4% on an
internal basis. This was driven by positive volume and price effects
across the portfolio.

The following operations weighed on internal growth:

Turkey: Gross premiums decreased to € 1,222 mn. This decrease
- 11.2% on an internal basis — largely resulted from our strategic
reduction in market share in the motor third-party liability insurance
business following a regulatory change.

Italy: Gross premiums amounted to € 4,512 mn. The decline of
13% on an internal basis resulted from unfavorable price effects in
our motor insurance business.

The decrease in operating profit was mainly driven by the fact that
our underwriting result suffered from higher losses from natural ca-
tastrophes. Furthermore, our investment result declined mainly due to
negative foreign currency translation effects net of hedging.

The underwriting result decrease was driven by an increase in
losses from natural catastrophes such as the storms Harvey, Maria,
and Irma in the third quarter, and the California wildfires in the fourth
quarter of 2017. A lower contribution from run-off compared to the
previous year also aggravated this development. As a consequence
our combined ratio deteriorated by 0.9 percentage points to 95.2%.

Our accident year loss ratio? was 70.6% — a 0.5 percentage point
deterioration compared to the previous year. This was driven by an
increase in losses from natural catastrophes from €689mn to
€1,111 mn, representing an adverse impact on our combined ratio,
which increased from 1.5 percentage points in 2016 to 2.4 percent-
age points in 2017.

‘C_ Group Management Report

Excluding losses from natural catastrophes, our accident year loss
ratio improved by 0.4 percentage points to 68.2%. This was predomi-
nantly due to profitability improvements across the Allianz Group.

The following operation contributed positively to the development of
our accident year loss ratio:

Benelux: 0.2 percentage points. The improvement was due to
the absence of natural catastrophes in 2017 whereas 2016 had been
impacted by storms, floods, and hail. Underwriting performance
measures improved our accident year loss ratio further.

The following operations weighed on the development of our acci-
dent year loss ratio:

Reinsurance: 0.6 percentage points. The accident year loss ratio
suffered from natural catastrophes such as the California wildfires in
October and the storms in the third quarter of 2017.

Germany: 0.2 percentage points. The deterioration was driven
by a heavy storm year. Storms Xavier, Paul, Herwart, and several
smaller events burdened the result throughout the year.

Credit Insurance: 0.1 percentage points. This was driven by sev-
eral medium sized large losses.

Our run-off result amounted to € 1,927 mn - after € 2,084 mn in 2016
— leading to a decreased run-off ratio of 4.1%, which was mainly
driven by our operations Reinsurance, Germany, and United King-
dom. Furthermore, we saw a negative impact in the beginning of
2017, a result of the Ogden rate change which affected our operat-
ing entities Reinsurance, United Kingdom, and Ireland.

Total expenses amounted to € 13,537 mn in 2017, compared to
€ 13,352 mn in the previous year. Our expense ratio remained stable
at 28.7% as a higher administrative expense ratio was offset by a
lower acquisition ratio.

Our South Korean business was disposed of at the end of 2016. In
order to best reflect the actual underlying drivers, operating profit
was reported in 2016 excluding South Korea, and the South Korean
operating loss specified as a separate item. Similarly, the figures for
present value of new business premiums are shown without effects
from the South Korean business. To ensure consistency with the Group
income statement, however, prior year statutory premiums are pre-
sented including premiums collected from our South Korean busi-
ness.

Statutory premiums’

On a nominal basis, statutory premiums increased by 4.1%. This
includes unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of € 494 mn
and negative (de-)consolidation effects of € 1,293 mn. On an internal
basis, statutory premiums went up by € 4,429 mn — or 7.0% — to
€ 67,277 mn.

Statutory premiums in the German life business rose to
€ 21,124 mn, translating into 11.9% growth on an internal basis —
which was largely due to higher sales of capital-efficient products.
Statutory premiums in the German health business climbed to
€ 3,360 mn — a 2.2% increase on an internal basis —-, much of which
resulted from the acquisition of new customers in the supplementary
health care coverage.

In the United States, statutory premiums amounted to
€ 9,720 mn, down 16.3% on an internal basis. This was caused by a
decrease in sales of fixed-indexed annuities. Increased sales of tradi-
tional variable annuities partly compensated for this development.

Annual Report 2017 - Allianz Group

In Italy, statutory premiums grew to € 11,160 mn. This increase —
17.1% on an internal basis — resulted mainly from higher unit-linked
single-premium sales, and was partially offset by a decrease in tradi-
tional life business.

In France, statutory premiums went up to € 8,457 mn, an in-
crease of 6.3% on an internal basis. This was predominantly due to
higher sales of capital-efficient products and a growth in our protec-
tion and health business.

In the Asia-Pacific region, statutory premiums stood at
€ 5,170 mn, a 26.4% rise on an internal basis. It was largely due to an
increase in unit-linked sales in Taiwan. Statutory premiums in South
Korea amounted to € 1,307 mn in 2016.

Present value of new business
premiums (PVNBP)*°

Our PVNBP increased by € 2,267 mn to € 59,469 mn, largely be-
cause our business with unit-linked insurance products without guar-
antees generated higher sales in Italy and the Asia-Pacific region, as
did our capital-efficient products in the German life business. This was
partly offset by a sales decline in our business with fixed-indexed
annuities in the United States.

Loadings from premiums went up along with sales, much of which

reserves was largely attributable to a higher reserve volume in
France as well as to higher product fee income stemming from the
growth in our non-traditional variable-annuity business in the United
States, due to favorable market movements. Unit-linked manage-
ment fees rose, mainly in Italy, as a result of both higher performance
fees and increased assets under management.

Our investment margin declined, mainly due to much lower realiza-

bonds has resulted in an elevated level in 2016. A lower investment
result in the United States driven by our business with fixed-indexed
annuities due to a swing in the hedging result and unlocking has also
contributed to this development. It was, however, partly compensated
by decreased impairments in Germany, following a better perfor-
mance of the equity market.

the United States. This was partly offset by higher expenses due to
sales growth in the Asia-Pacific region, in our German life business,
and in Italy.

Administrative and other expenses increased, mainly due to le-
gal accruals for non-recurring items in the United States and Asia-
Pacific region, but remained stable in relation to reserves.

TECHNICAL MARGIN*

Our technical margin increased, driven by one-off reserve adjust-
ments both in 2017 and 2016 in the United States as well as im-
proved loss ratios due to repricing and positive run-off in our protec-
tion and health business in France.

The higher negative impact of change in DAC was due to lower

annuities in the United States.

creased, primarily due to higher unit-linked management fees in Italy.
A decrease in operating profit in the capital-efficient products line
was largely attributable to a lower investment margin in the United
States.

Return on equity

Our return on equity increased by 14 percentage points to 12.1%.
Among other reasons, this is due to the fact that the 2016 figure had
been negatively impacted by the unfavorable development of our
South Korean business.

Net income

We registered an increase in our net income, which was largely due to
our operating performance and the fact that the prior year’s net
income had been negatively affected by our business in South Korea.

In the following section we focus on the development of third-party
assets under management.

As of 31 December 2017, the shares of third-party AuM by busi-
ness unit were 76.8% (31 December 2016: 76.1%) attributable to
PIMCO and 23.2% (31 December 2016: 23.9%) attributable to
AllianzGl

The share of fixed-income assets rose from 75.5% at the begin-
ning of the year to 76.4%. This was mainly due to the high third-party
AuM net inflows and — to a lesser extent — to positive effects from
Market and Other, which outweighed the negative foreign currency
translation effects. The share of equities declined from 10.3% to 9.4%.
Hereby, positive effects from equity markets could not offset third-
party AuM net outflows in combination with negative foreign curren-
cy translation effects as well as deconsolidation effects. The shares of
multi-assets and other were roughly stable at 10.2% and 4.0%
(31 December 2016: 10.0% and 4.2%, respectively).

Mutual funds® had a 59.4% share in third-party assets
(31 December 2016: 57.8%), while separate accounts® were at 40.6%
(31 December 2016: 42.2 %).

The regional allocation’ of third-party AuM shifted as follows:
America 53.4%, Europe 35.1% and the Asia-Pacific region 11.5%
(31 December 2016: 55.3%, 32.8% and 11.9%, respectively). This
development was due to strong growth in Europe, whereas the U.S.
share was affected by negative foreign currency translation effects.
The share of the Asia-Pacific region declined as positive effects, most-
ly from third-party AuM net inflows, were dampened by negative
foreign currency translation effects as well as the deconsolidation of
AllianzGl Korea.

The overall three-year rolling investment performance® of our
Asset Management business improved significantly, with 91% of third-
party assets outperforming their respective — benchmarks
(31 December 2016: 83%). The increase was driven by both PIMCO
and AllianzGl, improving from 88% to 95% and from 63% to 75%,
respectively.

Operating revenues

Our operating revenues increased by 6.4% on a nominal basis and
7.8% on an internal basis’.

We recorded lower performance fees, due to a decrease in
PIMCO’s fees, where carried interest declined due to the phasing out
of one large private fund. AllianzGI’s performance fees went up signif-
icantly, driven by positive developments in all business regions, espe-
cially in the United States.

Other net fee and commission income rose, driven by increased
average third-party AuM, mostly at PIMCO. Third-party AuM-driven
margins declined mainly at AllianzGl

Other operating revenues increased largely due to positive for-
eign currency translation effects on financial assets and liabilities
carried at fair value through profit and loss.

Operating profit

Our operating profit increased by a strong 10.6% on a nominal basis
and 12.7% on an internal basis*. This was mainly due to strong growth
in operating revenues, which was only partly offset by increased
administrative expenses.

The increase in administrative expenses was mainly driven by
higher personnel expenses at both PIMCO and AllianzGl. This
development was mainly due to a rise in variable compensation
going along with the overall positive business performance. To a
lesser extent, an increase in non-personnel expenses contributed to
the rise in administrative expenses.

Our cost-income ratio improved significantly, as revenue growth
outpaced the increase in expenses.

Earnings summary

Our operating result improved in 2017, due to the positive develop-
ments in all our reportable segments.

Our net loss widened, which primarily resulted from the impair-
ment driven by the recognition of a liability in connection with the
expected loss from the sale of Oldenburgische Landesbank AG?

In Holding & Treasury, we saw an improvement of our operating
result. It was largely driven by a higher net interest result, as well as by
lower administrative expenses caused by a decline in pension costs.

Banking’s operating result increased, driven by both a higher net
fee and commission result and lower loan loss provisions. The positive
development was partly offset by a lower net interest result.

The operating result generated by Alternative Investments in-
creased, due to a higher net fee and commission result that was only
partially offset by higher administrative expenses.

3.As of 31 December 2017, al requirements were stil fulfilled to present Oldenburgische Landesbank AG, Oldenburg,
allocated to the reportable segment Banking (Corporate and Othe), as a disposal group classified as hed for sole. The
closing of the transaction was nearly completed as of 31 December 2017. Therefore, an impairment and a labilty of

Economic outlook?

the world economy it is the strongest expansion period since 2011.
Global output is expected to increase by 3.2% in 2018.

Although political uncertainties linger, the global economic outlook
for 2018 is favorable. The U.S. economy is expected to grow by 2.6%.
The recently adopted tax reform package should contribute to higher
growth. The net tax reductions will underpin companies’ propensity to
invest and support solid consumption growth. In the Eurozone, growth
is likely to exceed 2% again in 2018. In particular, apart from the
favorable global backdrop, the fact that the loose European Central
Bank monetary policy continues to provide support, coupled with
broadly neutral fiscal policy, points to an ongoing recovery. As in
2017, the emerging market economies are expected to grow by close
to 5%. Asian emerging markets continue to benefit from the revival of
world trade and stable growth in China. The Eastern European coun-
tries capitalize on the continuing upturn in the Eurozone. We are
currently faced with a rather high degree of synchronization, and for

industry outlook’ is based on our own estimates.

Annual Report 2017 - Allianz Group

The uncertain global political environment bears the potential
for higher financial market volatility. Monetary policy also contributes
to this. As the U.S. economy is expected to expand solidly and infla-
tion rates continue to move up, the Federal Reserve will carry on
normalizing its monetary policy stance. Three further rate hikes in the
course of 2018 look realistic. In addition, the Federal Reserve will rein
in its balance sheet moderately. In the Eurozone, the European Cen-
tral Bank is expected to terminate its monthly bond purchasing pro-
gram in October, having halved the monthly volume to € 30 bn as of
January 2018. No key interest rate hikes are expected before 2019.
Modestly rising yields on 10-year U.S. government bonds, the good
economic situation in the Eurozone, and gradually rising inflation
rates are likely to influence investors’ interest rate expectations and
exert upward pressure on European benchmark bond yields. For 10-
year German government bonds, we see yields climbing modestly to
about 1% in the course of 2018; yields on 10-year U.S. government
bonds may end the year at close to 3%. While the ongoing Federal
Reserve rate-hiking cycle will weigh on the Euro, a number of other
factors will support it, among them the solid recovery in the Eurozone.
We expect the Dollar-to-Euro exchange rate to close the year at
about 1.15 (2017: 1.20).

Insurance industry outlook

The insurance industry can look towards 2018 with some optimism,
mainly for three reasons: Firstly, premium growth is set to increase as
the stronger economic momentum bolsters demand for insurance.
Secondly, the expected gradual rise in interest rates and yields can be
seen as the harbinger of the end of the long and cold “yield winter",
although it will still take some time until higher yields are reflected in
higher investment incomes. Finally, after the increase in financial
regulation in recent years, the insurance industry might enjoy a sort of
respite in 2018, a breathing space for better coping with the new
rules.

However, even if the macroeconomic and regulatory environ-
ment looks more favorable in 2018, it is by no means plain sailing for
the insurance industry. New technologies, from digitalization to Artifi-
cial Intelligence, continue to change the industry profoundly: Business
models need to be transformed, new skills to be learned, new part-
nerships to be built and new competition to be fended off. Further-
more, the ongoing digitalization of our lives will usher in a new era of
regulation, governing the use of data — the oil of the 21* century. On
the other hand, the upsides of the new technologies, in particular in
terms of simplicity and accessibility, should become more visible in
2018, too.

In the property-casualty sector, premium growth is expected to
accelerate in 2018, reflecting higher inflation and the ongoing broad-
based recovery of the global economy. As in previous years, emerging
markets are the main driver of growth: All regions, from Latin America
over Africa to Asia, should continue their recovery; in Emerging Asia,
premium growth could top 10%. In contrast, growth in advanced
markets will be much slower, at around 3%. Overall, we expect global
premium growth of about 5% in 2018 (in nominal terms and adjusted
for foreign currency translation effects). Assuming average losses
from natural catastrophes and more positive rate dynamics — particu-
larly in business lines affected by last year's losses — overall profitabil-
ity is likely to increase, although investment income might remain a
drag.

In the life sector, the overall picture is quite similar — with one ex-
ception: The growth lead of Emerging Asia over the rest of the world
is even more pronounced. While the advanced markets’ recovery
proceeds at a snail's pace and other emerging markets show robust
but more or less stable growth, many of Asia's emerging markets are
expected to clock growth rates of 15% or more. A rising middle class,
urbanization, aging societies, and last but not least a favorable policy
environment underpin the continued growth story. Overall, we expect
global premium growth to increase by about 6% in 2018 (in nominal
terms and adjusted for foreign currency translation effects) compared
to 2017. Global industry profitability could also improve in 2018,
albeit only modestly. This change for the better has not so much to do
with the slight rise in interest rates; it is mainly a result of recent man-
agement actions which steered insurance portfolios towards less
capital intensive business lines (such as protection) and investment
portfolios towards riskier but higher-yielding asset classes (such as
infrastructure).

52

Asset management industry outlook

For the asset management industry, 2018 might bring higher finan-
cial market volatility due to the geopolitical uncertainty. While the
positive economic outlook generally supports stock markets, we
believe that current valuation levels are very high already. In addition,
central banks are increasingly likely to move further away from ac-
commodative monetary policies. We therefore expect a more modest
capital market contribution to AUM growth. This may weigh down on
net inflows in certain asset classes, while it might create opportunities
in other areas. Investors may look to further de-risk into bonds as
yields become more attractive. Furthermore, bonds continue to be
particularly interesting for the growing number of retirees in devel-
oped countries as well as for liability-driven investors looking for a
stable stream of income.

The industry's profitability remains under pressure from both con-
tinuous flows into passive products and rising distribution costs, so the
trend towards industry consolidation will continue. At the same time,
digital channels are expected to continue gaining prominence.
Measures aimed at strengthening regulatory oversight and reporting
could also affect profitability in the asset management sector. In
order to continue growing, it is vital for asset managers to keep suffi-
cient business volumes, ensure efficient operations, and maintain
strong investment performance.

ASSUMPTIONS
Our outlook assumes no significant deviations from the following
underlying assumptions:

— Global economic growth is set to continue.
— Modest rise in interest rates expected.

— A100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would,
respectively, either raise or lower expected operating profit by
approximately € 0.1 bn in the first year following the rate
change.

— No major disruptions of capital markets.

— No disruptive fiscal or regulatory interference.

— Level of claims from natural catastrophes at expected average
levels.

— Average U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate of 1.22.

— A10% weakening or strengthening of the U.S. Dollar com-
pared to our planned exchange rate of 1.22 to the Euro
would have a negative or positive impact on operating profits
of approximately € 0.3 bn, respectively.

Management's assessment of expected revenues
and earnings for 2018

In 2017, our total revenues amounted to € 126.1 bn, a 3.0 % increase
on a nominal and a 5.0 % increase on an internal basis! compared to
2016. For 2018, we envisage relatively stable total revenues, with
Property-Casualty and Asset Management revenues showing an
upward trend, while Life/Health revenues remaining rather stable due
to our selective focus on profitable growth.

Our operating profit was in the upper half of our target range in
2017, hitting € 11.1 bn. For 2018, we envisage an operating profit of
€ 11.1 bn, plus or minus € 0.5 bn, as we expect a favorable develop-
ment in the Property-Casualty business segment, rather stable results
in the Asset Management business segment, and a slightly negative
development in the Life/Health and Corporate and Other business
segments.

Our net income attributable to shareholders decreased slightly
this past year, amounting to € 6.8 bn. Consistent with our disclosure
practice in the past, and given the susceptibility of our non-operating
results to adverse capital market developments, we refrain from
providing a precise outlook for net income. That said, following the
negative impact from the U.S. tax reform 2017 we expect a positive
annual impact of approximately €0.3 bn from the U.S. tax reform
starting in 2018. As a consequence, and assuming no major disrup-
tions to occur in the capital markets, we anticipate an increase in net
income for 2018.

1 Operating revenues adjusted for foreign curency translation and (de)consoldation effects.

Annual Report 2017 - Allianz Group

C_ Group Management Report

PROPERTY-CASUALTY INSURANCE
We expect our revenues to increase by approximately 2% in
2018(2017: +1.4%), supported by favorable volume and price effects.

Premium growth in 2018 is expected mainly from our Global
Lines such as Allianz Partners, where our B2B2C business activities
are bundled. Further growth is expected in our core European mar-
kets such as Germany, Spain and Italy, as well as in Turkey.

We believe the overall slow rise in prices we witnessed in a num-
ber of markets in 2017 will continue in 2018. However, as in previous
years we will keep our focus on achieving strong underwriting results
by adhering to our strict underwriting discipline, and will be willing to
accept a lower top line if target margins cannot be achieved.

In 2017, our combined ratio was at 95.2%, falling short of our ex-
pectation. This shortfall in profitability was driven by a number of
natural catastrophes. In 2018, we expect to achieve our target com-
bined ratio of 94%. The underlying assumption is that the aggregate
effect of improvements in pricing, claims management, and produc-
tivity will compensate for any underlying claims inflation. Despite the
high volatility of natural catastrophes in recent years, we assume
impacts to revert back to our historic claims experience.

As the low-interest-rate environment is likely to persist, invest-
ment income will remain under pressure due to the rather short dura-
tion of investments in the Property-Casualty business segment. Going
forward, we will continue to take measures to adapt our investment
strategy to changing market conditions.

Overall, we expect our 2018 operating profit to be in the range
of € 5.1 bn to € 5.7 bn (2017: € 5.1 bn).

LIFE/HEALTH INSURANCE

In 2017, our Life/Health operating profit was € 4.4 bn, thus exceeding
the target range, mainly because of a higher net harvesting result
and a higher technical margin. For 2018, we expect operating profit
in our Life/Health business segment to be between €3.9 bn and
€45 bn.

As pointed out in 2015, RoE is one of the key performance indica-
tors for the steering of our Life/Health business. In 2018, we expect
the RoE of the Life/Health business segment to be between 10.0%
and 12.0%.

We will remain focused on shifting our new business mix towards
capital-efficient, unit-linked, and protection products — which, in view
of the prolonged low-yield environment, also match customer needs
- while maintaining strong shareholder returns and building on our
strong track record of product innovation. In addition, we will contin-
ue to actively manage both our new and in-force business through
continuous repricing, expense management, asset/liability manage-
ment, and crediting strategies, which should allow us to further miti-
gate the impacts of difficult market conditions — particularly the low
interest rates — and maintain our profitability targets.

It must be noted, however, that market volatility, along with the
level of net harvesting, can significantly affect the Life/Health busi-
ness segment results.

‘C_ Group Management Report

ASSET MANAGEMENT

While we expect continued strong inflows in 2018 at both PIMCO
and AllianzGl, a moderation of the exceptionally high inflows of 2017
is likely to occur. Another growth opportunity should result from the
integration of Allianz Capital Partners into AllianzG! on
1 January 2018, with the opportunity to leverage this platform for
external growth in the future. While we expect performance fees to
decrease slightly, growth in AuM should drive an increase in man-
agement and loading fees, and thus a slight increase in operating
revenues, which should more than offset the moderate increase of
operating expenses we envisage. Pressure on profit growth is likely to
come from a weaker U.S. Dollar compared to 2017. All in all, we
envisage our operating profit to range between € 2.1 bn and € 2.7 bn
in 2018 (2017: € 2.4 bn).

In 2018, we continue to expect a cost-income ratio of well below
65% (2017: 61.9%) despite the slightly negative impact on the cost-
income ratio related to the consolidation of Allianz Capital Partners
into AllianzGl, supported by our focus on expense discipline and
operational excellence. In the mid-term we expect our cost-income
ratio to reach 60%.

CORPORATE AND OTHER

Our Corporate and Other business segment recorded an operating
loss of € 0.8 bn in 2017. We predict an operating loss in the range of
€ 0.8 bn to € 1.0 bn for Corporate and Other (consolidation included)
in 2018, as the positive impact in 2017, related to the cost allocation
scheme for pension provisions, will not recur in 2018.

Financing and liquidity
development and capitalization

The Allianz Group benefits from a very healthy liquidity position and
excellent financial strength with a capitalization well above regulato-
ry requirements.

As a result, we have full access to financial markets and are ina
position to raise financing at low cost. We are committed to maintain-
ing our strong financial flexibility, which is supported by both a pru-
dent steering of our liquidity resources and a well-balanced debt
maturity profile.

We also monitor the capital position of the Group, as well as at
each of our operating entities, very closely. In addition, we will contin-
ue to optimize the sensitivity of our solvency ratio to changes of inter-
est rates and spreads through asset/liability management and life
product design.

54

Expected dividend development?

For 2017, the Allianz SE Board of Management and Supervisory
Board propose a dividend of € 8.00 per share.

In addition, Allianz SE has decided to launch a share buy-back
program with a volume of up to € 2.0 bn as part of a previously
announced policy to return capital to its shareholders on a flexible
basis. The share buy-back program is based on the authorization
granted by the Annual General Meeting on 7 May 2014. The buy-
back program, which started in January 2018, is envisaged to be
executed in the first six months of 2018. Allianz SE will cancel all
repurchased shares.

Through prudent capital management, Allianz Group aims to
maintain a healthy balance between an attractive yield and in-
vestment in profitable growth. We will continue to return 50% of
Allianz Group's net income (attributable to shareholders) to share-
holders in the form of a regular dividend.

Allianz also aims to keep the regular dividend per share at
least at the level paid in the previous year. Allianz will also continue
to return capital to its shareholders on a flexible basis.

All of the above remains subject to a sustainable Solvency II ra-
tio above 160%, which is substantially below our current level of
229%? and 20 percentage points lower than our target range for
the Solvency II ratio of 180 to 220%.

Management's overall assessment of the current
economic situation of the Allianz Group

At the date of issuance of this Annual Report, and based on current
information regarding natural catastrophes and capital market
trends — in particular foreign currency, interest rates, and equities —,
the Board of Management has no indication that the Allianz Group is
facing any major adverse developments.

Total assets and total liabilities

As of 31 December 2017, total assets amounted to € 901.3 bn and
total liabilities were € 832.7 bn. Compared to year-end 2016, total
assets and total liabilities increased by € 17.5 bn and by €19.0 bn,
respectively.

The following section focuses on our financial investments in
debt instruments, equities, real estate, and cash, as these reflect the
major developments in our asset base.

STRUCTURE OF INVESTMENTS - PORTFOLIO
OVERVIEW

The following portfolio overview covers the Allianz Group's assets
held for investment, which are largely driven by our insurance busi-

nesses.
The decrease in shareholders’ equity was largely due to the dividend
pay-out in May 2017 (€ 3,410 mn) and the share buy-back program?
which started in February 2017 (€ 2,998 mn). Negative impacts from
foreign currency translation further contributed to the decline. Net
income attributable to shareholders of € 6,803 mn had a partly off-
setting effect.

LIABILITIES

PROPERTY-CASUALLTY LIABILITIES

As of 31 December 2017, the business segment's gross reserves for
loss and loss adjustment expenses as well as discounted loss reserves
amounted to € 66.2 bn, compared to € 65.7 bn at year-end 2016. On
a net basis, our reserves, including discounted loss reserves, de-
creased slightly from € 57.3 bn to € 56.3 bn

LIFE/HEALTH LIABILITIES

Life/Health reserves for insurance and investment contracts increased
by € 8.3 bn to € 499.1 bn. An € 20.4 bn increase (before foreign cur-
rency translation effects) in aggregate policy reserves was mainly
driven by our operations in Germany (€ 12.6 bn) and the United
States (€ 7.3 bn before foreign currency translation effects). Reserves
for premium refunds increased slightly by € 1.3 bn (before foreign
currency translation effects), due to higher unrealized gains to be
shared with policyholders. Foreign currency translation effects re-
duced the balance sheet value by € 13.3 bn, mainly due to the weak-
er U.S. Dollar (€ (11.3) bn).

Off-balance sheet arrangements

In the normal course of business, the Allianz Group may enter into
arrangements that do not lead to the recognition of assets and liabili-
ties in the consolidated financial statements under IFRS. Since the
Allianz Group does not rely on off-balance sheet arrangements as a
significant source of revenue or financing, our off-balance sheet
exposure to loss is immaterial relative to our financial position.

The Allianz Group enters into various commitments including
loan and leasing commitments, purchase obligations, and other
commitments. For more details please refer to note 37 to the consoli-
dated financial statements.

The Allianz Group has also entered into contractual relationships
with various types of structured entities. They have been designed in
such a way that their relevant activities are directed by means of
contractual arrangements rather than voting or similar rights. Typical-
ly, structured entities have been set up in connection with asset-
backed financings and certain investment fund products. For more
details on our involvement with structured entities, please refer to
note 35 to the consolidated financial statements.

LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RESOURCES

Organization

The Allianz Group's liquidity management is based on policies and
guidelines approved by the Allianz SE Board of Management. Alli-
nz SE and each of the operating entities are responsible for manag-
ing their respective liquidity positions, while Allianz SE provides cen-
tral cash pooling for the Group. Capital allocation is managed by
Allianz SE for the entire Group. This structure allows the efficient use
of liquidity and capital resources and enables Allianz SE to achieve
the desired liquidity and capitalization levels for the Group and its
operating entities.

Liquidity management
of our operating entities

INSURANCE OPERATIONS

The major sources of liquidity for our operational activities are prima-
ry and reinsurance premiums received, reinsurance receivables col-
lected, investment income, and proceeds generated from the maturi-
ty or sale of investments. These funds are mainly used to pay claims
arising from the Property-Casualty insurance business and related
expenses, life policy benefits, surrenders and cancellations, acquisi-
tion costs, and operating costs.

We receive a large part of premiums before payments of claims
or policy benefits are required, generating solid cash flows from our
insurance operations. This allows us to invest the funds in the interim
to create investment income.

Our insurance operations also carry a high proportion of liquid
investments, which can be converted into cash to pay for claims.
Generally, our investments in fixed income securities are sequenced to
mature when funds are expected to be needed.

The overall liquidity of our insurance operations depends on cap-
ital market developments, interest rate levels, and our ability to real-
ize the market value of our investment portfolio to meet insurance
claims and policyholder benefits. Other factors affecting the liquidity
of our Property-Casualty insurance operations include the timing,
frequency, and severity of losses underlying our policies and policy
renewal rates. In our Life operations, liquidity needs are generally
influenced by trends in actual mortality rates compared to the as-
sumptions underlying our life insurance reserves. Market returns,
crediting rates, and the behavior of our life insurance clients — for
example, regarding the level of surrenders and withdrawals — can
also have significant impacts.

Annual Report 2017 - Allianz Group

ASSET MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS

Within our Asset Management operations, the most important
sources of liquidity are fees generated from asset management
activities. These are primarily used to cover operating expenses.

BANKING OPERATIONS

Major sources of liquidity in our Banking operations include customer
deposits, interbank loans, and interest and similar income from our
lending transactions. The most important uses of funds are the issu-
ance of new loans and investments in fixed income securities. The
liquidity of our Banking operations is largely dependent on the ability
of our private and corporate customers to meet their payment obli-
gations arising from loans and other outstanding commitments. Our
ability to retain our customers’ deposits is equally important to us.

Liquidity management
and funding of Allianz SE

The responsibility for managing the funding needs within the Group,
maximizing access to liquidity sources, and minimizing borrowing
costs lies with Allianz SE. We therefore comment on the liquidity and
funding resources of Allianz SE in the following sections. Restrictions
on the transferability of capital within the Group mainly result from
the capital maintenance rules under applicable company laws, as
well as from the regulatory solvency capital requirements for regulat-
ed Group companies.

LIQUIDITY RESOURCES AND USES

Allianz SE ensures adequate access to liquidity and capital for our
operating subsidiaries. The main sources of liquidity available for
Allianz SE are dividends received from subsidiaries and funding
provided by capital markets. Liquidity resources are defined as readily
available assets — specifically cash, money market investments, and
highly liquid government bonds. Our funds are primarily used for
interest payments on our debt funding, operating costs, internal and
external growth investments, and dividends to our shareholders.

FUNDING SOURCES

Allianz SE's access to external funds depends on various factors such
as capital market conditions, access to credit facilities, credit ratings,
and credit capacity. The financial resources available to Allianz SE in
the capital markets for short-, mid- and long-term funding needs are
described below. In general, mid- to long-term financing is covered
by issuing senior or subordinated bonds or ordinary shares.

EQUITY FUNDING
As of 31 December 2017, the issued capital registered at the Com-
mercial Register was € 1,169,920,000. This was divided into
440,249,646 registered shares with restricted transferability. As of

Interest expenses on senior bonds decreased, mainly due to lower
funding costs on average in 2017. For subordinated bonds, the in-
crease of interest expenses was primarily driven by higher outstand-
ing volumes on average in 2017.

LONG-TERM DEBT FUNDING

As of 31 December 2017, Allianz SE had senior and subordinated
bonds with a variety of maturities outstanding, reflecting our focus on
long-term financing. As the cost and availability of external funding
may be negatively affected by general market conditions or by mat-
ters specific to the financial services industry or the Allianz Group, we
seek to reduce refinancing risk by actively steering the maturity profile
of our funding structure.

SHORT-TERM DEBT FUNDING

Short-term funding sources available are the Medium-Term Note
Program and the Commercial Paper Program. Money market securi-
ties increased in the use of commercial paper, compared to the pre-
vious year-end. Interest expenses on money market securities in-
creased mainly due to higher funding costs on average in 2017.

The Group maintained its A-1+/Prime-1 ratings for short-term issu-
ances. Thus we can continue funding our liquidity under the Euro
Commercial Paper Program at an average rate for each tranche
below Euribor, and under the U.S. Dollar Commercial Paper Program
at an average rate for each tranche below U.S. Libor.

Further potential sources of short-term funding allowing the

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by € 11.7 bn
to € 33.2 bn in 2017. This consists of net income plus adjustments for
non-cash charges, credits and other items included in net earnings,
and cash flows related to the net change in operating assets and
liabilities. Net income after adding back non-cash charges and simi-
lar items increased by € 1.5 bn to €10.6bn in 2017. Furthermore,
operating cash flows from net changes in operating assets and liabili-
ties, including other items, rose by € 10.2 bn to € 22.6 bn. The devel-
opment of assets and liabilities held for trading, particularly in our
Life/Health business segment in Germany, resulted in a net cash
inflow. In addition, higher reserves for loss and loss adjustment ex-
penses were recorded, driven by the property-casualty insurance
business mainly in Germany and France.

Net cash outflow used in investing activities increased by
€5.0 bn to € 24.8 bn. The main drivers were higher net cash outflows
from available-for-sale investments, particularly in Life/Health busi-

ness segment in Germany. Moreover, new investments in associates
and joint ventures required cash investments. Finally, the develop-
ment of our position in loans and advances to banks and customers,
mainly in our Life/Health business segment in Germany, led to net
cash outflows.

Net cash outflow used in financing activities was higher in 2017
by € 3.3 bn and amounted to € 5.0 bn. The main reasons for this were
transactions between equity holders, in particular the Allianz SE share
buy-back program as well as the share purchase agreement with
minority-shareholders of Euler Hermes. Those effects were partly
compensated by higher net cash inflows from our refinancing activi-
ties, especially due to an increase in certificated liabilities.

Cash and cash equivalents amounted to € 17.1 bn, reflecting a
€ 2.7 bn increase compared to 2016. This resulted from higher cash
on current accounts balances, mainly in investment funds, and higher
balances with central banks in the reportable segment Banking
(Corporate and Other).

flows, please refer to (©) page 84.

RECONCILIATIONS

The previous analysis is based on our consolidated financial state-
ments and should be read in conjunction with them. In addition to our
figures stated in accordance with the International Financial Report-
ing Standards (IFRS), the Allianz Group uses operating profit and
internal growth to enhance the understanding of our results. These
additional measures should be viewed as complementary to, rather
than a substitute for, our figures determined according to IFRS.

For further information, please refer to note 4 to the consolidat-
ed financial statements.

Composition of total revenue growth

We believe that an understanding of our total revenue performance
is enhanced when the effects of foreign currency translation as well
as acquisitions, disposals, and transfers (or “changes in scope of
consolidation”) are analyzed separately. Accordingly, in addition to
presenting nominal total revenue growth, we also present internal
growth, which excludes these effects.

RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT

Target and strategy of risk management

Allianz aims to ensure that the Group is adequately capitalized at all
times and that all related undertakings at least meet their respective
regulatory capital requirements for the benefit of both shareholders
and policyholders. Furthermore, risk capital reflecting the risk profile
and the cost of capital are important aspects considered in business
decisions.

In addition, we take into account the requirements of regulators
and rating agencies. While capital requirements imposed by regula-
tors constitute a binding constraint, meeting rating agencies’ capital
requirements and maintaining strong credit ratings are strategic
business objectives of the Allianz Group.

We closely monitor the capital position and risk concentrations
of the Group and its related undertakings along each of these dimen-
sions, and apply regular stress tests (including standardized, historical
and reverse stress test scenarios as well as monthly stress scenarios
focusing on current and possible future developments). This allows us
to take appropriate measures to ensure our continued capital and
solvency strength.

Risk governance system

RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

As a provider of financial services, we consider risk management to
be a core competency and an integral part of our business. Our risk
management framework covers all operations and subsidiaries
within the Group in proportion to the inherent risks of the activities,
ensuring that risks across the Group are consistently identified, ana-
lyzed, assessed, and managed. The primary goals of our risk man-
agement framework are:

— Promotion of a strong risk management culture, supported by a
robust risk governance structure.

— Consistent and proportional application of an integrated risk
capital framework to protect our capital base and support effec-
tive capital management.

— Integration of risk considerations and capital needs into man-
agement and decision-making process by attributing risk and al-
locating capital to business segments, products, and strategies.

Our risk management system is based on the following four pillars:

— Risk identification and underwriting: Risk identification and
underwriting form the foundation for adequate risk management
decisions. Supporting activities include standards for underwrit-
ing, valuation methods, individual transaction and new product
approvals, emerging-/operational-/top-risk assessments, and
scenario analysis, amongst others.

— Risk strategy and risk appetite: Our risk strategy defines our risk
appetite consistent with our business strategy. It ensures that re-
wards are appropriately based on the risks taken and capital re-
quired and that delegated authorities are in line with our overall
risk-bearing capacity and strategy.

62

— Risk reporting and monitoring: Our comprehensive qualitative
and quantitative risk monitoring and reporting framework pro-
vides management with the transparency needed to assess
whether our risk profile falls within delegated limits and to identi-
fy emerging issues quickly. For example, risk dashboards and limit
consumption reports as well as scenario analysis and stress tests
are regularly prepared and communicated.

— Communication and transparency: Transparent risk disclosure
provides the basis for communicating our strategy and perfor-
mance to internal and external stakeholders, ensuring a sustain-
able positive impact on valuation and financing. It also strength-
ens the risk awareness and risk culture throughout the entire
Group.

OUR STRATEGY

OUR BUSINESS ASPIRATIONS
Allianz Group seeks to position itself as the world’s most trusted fi-
nancial institution focusing on the following

— Portfolio strength: establishing a strong and high-quality portfo-
lio in large and attractive markets.

— Market leadership: maintaining a commanding position in each
market with superior skills and scale.

— Customer centricity: practicing relentless execution centered on
customers while outperforming competition

These aspirations have been translated into clear ambitions for 2018.
With regard to financial performance, we strive for a return on equity
of 13% (excluding unrealized gains/losses on bonds net of shadow
accounting), while growing our earnings per share at a compound
annual growth rate of 5%.

To ensure the sustainability of our performance, we have set our-
selves health targets for customer loyalty and employee engage-
ment: Our ambition is for at least 75% of our businesses to be or
become rated by their customers as Loyalty Leader or above-market
in terms of Net Promoter Score (NPS). At the same time, we aim to
have our Inclusive Meritocracy Index at 72% (or above) in 2018, a
level we reached already in 2017

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY

In order to achieve these aspirations, the Board of Management of
Allianz SE has defined a clear business strategy which is based on the
following five pillars:

— True Customer Centricity: making superior customer experience
the top priority for all our actions.

— Digital by Default: moving from selected leading assets to be-
come “Digital by Default” everywhere.

— Technical Excellence: creating superior margins, innovation, and
growth through best talents and state-of-the-art skills.

— Growth Engines: systematically exploiting new sources for profit-
able growth.

‘Annual Report 2027 - Allianz Group


--- Page 30 ---

— Inclusive Meritocracy: reinforcing a culture where both people
and performance matter, including gender diversity and women
in leadership.

The Board of Management of Allianz SE has also defined a strategy
for the management of risk. This risk strategy places a particular
emphasis on protecting the Allianz brand and reputation, remaining
solvent even in the event of extreme adverse scenarios, maintaining
sufficient liquidity to always meet financial obligations, and providing
resilient profitability.

RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

SUPERVISORY BOARD AND BOARD OF
MANAGEMENT

Allianz’s approach to risk governance enables an integrated man-
agement of local and global risks and ensures that our risk profile
remains consistent with both our risk strategy and our capacity to
bear risks.

Within our risk governance system, the Supervisory Board and
Board of Management of Allianz SE have both Allianz SE and group-
wide responsibilities. The Board of Management formulates business
objectives and a corresponding risk strategy; the core elements of the
risk framework are set out in the Allianz Group Risk Policy, approved
by the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board advises, chal-
lenges and supervises the Board of Management in the performance
of its management activities. The following committees support the
Board and the Supervisory Board on risk issues:

Supervisory Board Risk Committee

The Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board monitors the effective-
ness of the Allianz risk management framework. Furthermore, it
focuses on risk-related developments as well as general risks and
specific risk exposures.

Group Finance and Risk Committee

The Group Finance and Risk Committee (GFRC) provides oversight of
the Group’‘s and Allianz SE's risk management framework, acting as a
primary early-warning function by monitoring the Allianz Group's and
Allianz SE's risk profiles as well as the availability of capital. The GFRC
also ensures that an adequate relationship between return and risk is
maintained. Additionally, the GFRC defines risk standards, forms the
limit-setting authority within the framework set by the Board of Man-
agement, and approves major financing and reinsurance transac-
tions. Finally, the GFRC supports the Board of Management with
recommendations regarding the capital structure, capital allocation,
and investment strategy, including the strategic asset allocation.

OVERALL RISK ORGANIZATION AND ROLES IN RISK
MANAGEMENT

A comprehensive system of risk governance is achieved by setting
standards related to organizational structure, risk strategy and appe-
tite, limit systems, documentation, and reporting. These standards
ensure the accurate and timely flow of risk-related information and a
disciplined approach towards decision-making and execution at both
the global and local level.

Annual Report 2017 - Allianz Group

C_ Group Management Report

As a general principle, the “first line of defense” rests with busi-
ness managers in the related undertaking. They are responsible for
both the risks and returns from their decisions. Our “second line of
defense” is made up of independent global oversight functions in-
cluding Risk, Actuarial, Compliance, and Legal, which support the
Board in defining the risk frameworks within which the business can
operate. Audit forms the “third line of defense”, independently and
regularly reviewing risk governance implementation, compliance with
risk principles, performing quality reviews of risk processes, and test-
ing adherence to business standards, including the internal control
framework.

Group Risk management function

Group Risk is managed by the Group Chief Risk Officer and supports
the Board of Management of Allianz SE, including its committees,
through the analysis and communication of risk-management-
related information and in implementing committee decisions.

Group Risk supports the Board of Management in developing
the risk management framework, which covers risk governance, risk
strategy and appetite, and risk monitoring and reporting. Group Risk
is operationally responsible for assessing risks and monitoring limits
and accumulations of specific risks across business lines, including
natural and man-made disasters and exposures to financial markets
and counterparties.

Group Risk strengthens and maintains the Group’s risk network
through regular and close interaction with the management of relat-
ed undertakings and other key stakeholders such as the local finance,
risk, actuarial and investment departments. A strong group-wide risk
network allows the Allianz Group to identify risks at early stages and
bring them to management's attention.

Related undertakings

Related undertakings? are responsible for their own risk management,
including adherence to both external requirements (for example,
those imposed by local regulators) and internal standards. Their
Boards of Management are responsible for setting and approving a
local risk strategy during the annual Strategic and Planning Dialogs
with the Group, and for ensuring adherence to their risk strategy.

A risk function headed by a Chief Risk Officer, which is
independent from business line management, is established by each
related undertaking. A local Risk Committee supports both the Board
of Management and the Chief Risk Officer by acting as the primary
risk controlling body.

Consistent implementation of the Group's risk management
framework in the related undertakings, including regular dialog
between the Group and the entity, is ensured through, for example,
the Group Risk representation on local Risk Committees as well as the
regular assessments of the local risk management framework and
Chief Risk Officers by Group Risk. Moreover, the Group Chief Risk
Officer must be consulted on decisions regarding the staffing of local
Chief Risk Officers.

1 Related undertokings are also referred to as operating entities.

Other functions and bodies

In addition to Group Risk and the local risk functions, legal, compli-
ance, and actuarial functions established at both the Group and
related entity level constitute additional components of the “second
line of defense”.

Group Legal and Group Compliance seek to mitigate legal risks
with support from other departments. The objectives of both func-
tions are to ensure that laws and regulations are observed, to react
appropriately to all impending legislative changes or new court
rulings, to attend to legal disputes and litigation, and to provide
legally appropriate solutions for transactions and business processes.
In addition, Group Compliance — in conjunction with Group Legal and
other experts involved — is responsible for integrity management,
which aims to protect the Allianz Group, our related undertakings
and employees from regulatory risks.

Group Actuarial contributes towards assessing and managing
risks in line with regulatory requirements, in particular for those risks
whose management requires actuarial expertise. The range of tasks
includes, among others, the calculation and monitoring of technical
provisions, technical actuarial assistance in business planning, report-
ing and monitoring of the results, and supporting the effective im-
plementation of the risk management system.

Risk based steering and risk management

The Allianz Group is exposed to a variety of risks through its core
insurance and asset management activities including market, credit,
underwriting, business, operational, strategic, liquidity, and reputa-
tional risks.

As an integrated financial services provider, we consider diversi-
fication across different business segments and regions to be a key
element in managing our risks efficiently, limiting the economic im-
pact of any single event and contributing to relatively stable results.
Our aim is to maintain a balanced risk profile without any dispropor-
tionately large risk concentrations and accumulations.

With Solvency Il being the regulatory regime relevant for the
Group since 1 January 2016, our risk profile is measured and steered
based on our approved Solvency Il internal model". We have intro-
duced a target solvency ratio in accordance with Solvency Il, based
on pre-defined shock scenarios at the level of both the Group and
related undertakings, supplemented by economic scenarios and
sensitivity analysis.

In addition, central elements of Allianz’s dividend policy are
linked to Solvency II capitalization based on our internal model. By
that we allow for a consistent view on risk steering and capitalization
under the Solvency II framework.

Allianz steers its portfolio using a comprehensive view of risk and
return based on the internal model and including scenario analysis:
Risk and concentrations are actively restricted by limits based on our
model and there is a comprehensive analysis of the return on risk
capital (RoRC) for all business activities. RORC allows us to identify

‘From a formalstic perspective, the German Supervisory Authorty deems our model to be “partial” because not all our
entities are using the internal model. Some of our smaller entities report under the standord model and others under the
deduction and aggregation approach. Without loss of generality, we might use the term internal model in the following
chapters, eg, in case descriptions also referring to entities that use the internal model, or descriptions focusing on
processes with respect tothe internal model components

64

profitable lines of business and products on a sustainable basis,
reflecting the capital commitment over the life time of the products
and is a key criterion for capital allocation decisions.

As a consequence, the internal model is fully integrated in busi-
ness steering and its application satisfies the so-called “use test”
under Solvency II.

MARKET RISK

As an inherent part of our insurance operations, we collect premiums
from our policyholders and invest them in a wide variety of assets; the
resulting investment portfolios back the future claims and benefits to
our customers. In addition, we also invest shareholders’ capital, which
is required to support the business. Finally, we use derivatives, mostly
to hedge our portfolio against adverse market movements (for ex-
ample, protective puts) or to reduce our reinvestment risk (for exam-
ple, by using forwards, swaps, or swaptions). Asset/liability manage-
ment (ALM) decisions are taken based on the internal model,
considering both the risks and the returns on the financial market.

As the fair values of our investment portfolios and liabilities de-
pend on changes on the financial markets, we are exposed to the risk
of adverse financial market developments. The long-dated liabilities
in our Life/Health business segment contribute to interest rate risk, in
particular if they cannot be matched by available investments due to
long maturities; in addition, we are also exposed to adverse changes
in equity and real estate prices, credit spread levels, inflation, implied
volatilities, and currencies, which might impact the value of our port-
folios.

To measure these market risks, real-world stochastic models for
the relevant risk factors are calibrated using historical time series to
generate possible future market developments. After the scenarios
for all the risk factors are generated, the asset and liability positions
are revalued under each scenario. The worst-case outcome of the
sorted portfolio profit and loss distribution at a certain confidence
level (99.5%) defines the market Value at Risk (VaR). For entities
modeled using the standard formula, the market risk is based on
aggregating the losses under defined standard formula shocks.

Strategic asset allocation benchmarks and risk limits, including
financial VaR, stand-alone interest rate and equity sensitivity limits,
and foreign exchange exposure limits, are defined for the Group and
the related undertaking. Limits are closely monitored and, if a breach
occurs, countermeasures are implemented which may include the
escalation and/or closing of positions. Furthermore, we have put in
place standards for hedging activities due to exposure to fair-value
options embedded in life insurance products. Finally, guidelines are
provided by the Group regarding certain investments, new investment
products and the use of derivatives. Compliance with these guidelines
is controlled by the respective risk and controlling functions.

INTEREST RATE RISK

Allianz is a liability-driven investor. If the duration of our assets is
shorter than our liabilities, we may suffer an economic loss in a fall-
ing-rate environment as we reinvest maturing assets at lower rates
prior to the maturity of liability contracts. This risk is higher for long-
dated life investment and savings products, with a significant part of
the Life/Health business segments interest rate risk coming from
Western Europe, mainly from traditional life insurance products with
guarantees. By contrast, opportunities may arise when interest rates
increase. This may result in returns from reinvestments being higher

‘Annual Report 2027 - Allianz Group


--- Page 32 ---

than the rates guaranteed. Interest rate risk is managed within our
asset/liability management process and controlled via interest rate
sensitivity and duration mismatch limits for the Group and entities.

INFLATION RISK

As an insurance company, we are exposed to changing inflation
rates, predominantly due to our Non-Life insurance obligations but
also due to inflation-indexed internal pension obligations. Inflation
assumptions are taken into account in our product development and
pricing. However, unexpected inflation increases both future claims
and expenses, leading to greater liabilities; conversely, if future infla-
tion rates were to be lower than assumed, liabilities would be lower
than anticipated. The risk of changing inflation rates is incorporated
in our internal model.

EQUITY RISK

The Group's insurance-focused operating entities may hold equity
investments to diversify their portfolios and take advantage of ex-
pected long-term returns. Strategic asset allocation benchmarks and
investment limits are used to manage and monitor these exposures.
In addition, equity investments fall within the scope of the credit risk
platform to avoid single-name risk concentrations. Risks from chang-
es in equity prices are normally associated with decreasing share
prices and increasing equity price volatilities. As stock markets also
might increase, opportunities may arise from equity investments.

CREDIT SPREAD RISK

Fixed-income assets such as bonds may lose value if credit spreads
widen. However, our risk appetite for credit spread risk takes into
account the underlying economics of our business model: As a liabil-
ity-driven investor, we typically hold fixed-income assets until maturity.
This implies that short-term changes in market prices do not affect us.
In our capacity as a long-term investor, this gives us the opportunity to
invest in bonds yielding spreads over the risk-free return and earning
this additional yield component.

CURRENCY RISK

Our operating entities typically invest in assets which are dominated
in the same currency as their liabilities; however, some foreign curren-
cy exposures are allowed to support portfolio diversification and
tactical investment decisions. Our largest exposure to foreign curren-
cy risk comes from our ownership of non-Euro entities: if the Euro
strengthens, the Euro equivalent net asset value of our foreign subsid-
iaries will decline from a Group perspective; however, at the same
time the capital requirements in Euro will decrease, partially mitigat-
ing the total impact on the Group capitalization. Based on our for-
eign-exchange management limit framework, currency risk is moni-
tored and managed at both the local and Group level.

REAL ESTATE RISK
Despite the risk of decreasing real estate values, real estate is a suit-
able addition to our investment portfolio due to good diversification
benefits as well as to the contribution of relatively predictable, long-
term cash flows.

The Group Investment Committee of Allianz has defined a
framework for standard transactions for real estate equity and com-
mercial real estate loan investments. These standards outline diversi-

Annual Report 2017 - Allianz Group

C_ Group Management Report

fication targets, minimum return hurdles, and other qualitative and
quantitative requirements. All transactions that do not meet these
standards or have a total investment volume (including costs) ex-
ceeding a defined threshold must be reviewed individually by Group
Risk and other group center functions. In addition, all applicable
limits must be met, in particular the limits set for the portfolio of an
investing entities by the strategic asset allocation and its respective
leeway as well as risk limits.

CREDIT RISK
Credit risk is measured as the potential economic loss in the value of
our portfolio that would result from either changes in the credit quali-
ty of our counterparties (“migration risk”) or the inability or unwilling-
ness of a counterparty to fulfill contractual obligations (“default risk”).
The Group's credit risk profile comes from three sources: our in-
vestment portfolio, credit insurance business, and external reinsur-
ance.

— Investment portfolio: Credit risk results from our investments in
fixed-income bonds, loans, derivatives, cash positions, and re-
ceivables whose value may decrease depending on the credit
quality of the obligor. However, losses due to credit events can be
shared with the policyholder for certain life insurance products.

— Credit insurance: Credit risk arises from potential claim payments
on limits granted by Euler Hermes to its policyholders. Euler Her-
mes insures its policyholders from credit risk associated with
short-term trade credits advanced to clients of the policyholder. If
the client of the policyholder is unable to meet its payment obli-
gations, Euler Hermes indemnifies the loss to the policyholder.

— Reinsurance: Credit risk arises from potential losses from non-
recoverability of reinsurance receivables or due to default on
benefits under in-force reinsurance treaties. Our reinsurance part-
ners are carefully selected by a dedicated team. Besides focusing
on companies with strong credit profiles, we may further require
letters of credit, cash deposits, or other financial measures to fur-
ther mitigate our exposure to credit risk.

The internal credit risk capital model takes into account the major
determinants of credit risk for each instrument, including exposure at
default, rating, seniority, collateral, and maturity. Additional parame-
ters assigned to obligors are migration probabilities and obligor asset
correlations reflecting dependencies within the portfolio. Ratings are
assigned to single obligors via an internal rating approach. It is based
on long-term ratings from rating agencies, which are dynamically
adjusted using market-implied ratings and the most recent qualita-
tive information available.

The loss profile of a given portfolio is obtained through Monte
Carlo simulation, taking into account interdependencies and expo-
sure concentrations per obligor segment. The loss profiles are calcu-
lated at different levels of the Allianz Group, and then fed into the
internal model at each level for further aggregation across sources of
risk to derive diversified credit risk.

Our credit insurance portfolio is modeled by Euler Hermes based
on a proprietary model component, which is a local adaptation of
the central internal credit risk model. Euler Hermes’ loss profile is
integrated in the Group's internal credit risk model to capture the
concentration and diversification effects.

‘C_ Group Management Report

To ensure effective credit risk management, credit VaR limits are
derived from our internal risk capital framework, and rating bucket
benchmarks are used to define our risk appetite for exposures in the
lower investment grade and non-investment grade area.

Our group-wide country and obligor group limit management
framework (CRisP?) allows us to manage counterparty concentration
risk, covering both credit and equity exposures at the Group and
operating entity levels. This limit framework forms the basis for dis-
cussions on credit actions and provides notification services with a
quick and broad communication of credit-related decisions across the
Group.

Clearly defined processes ensure that exposure concentrations
and limit utilizations are appropriately monitored and managed. The
setting of country and obligor exposure limits from the Group's per-
spective (i.e. the maximum concentration limit) takes into account the
Allianz Group's portfolio size and structure as well as our overall risk
strategy.

UNDERWRITING RISK

Underwriting risk consists of premium and reserve risks in the Proper-
ty-Casualty? business segment as well as biometric risks in the
Life/Health? business segment. Underwriting risks are not relevant for
the Asset Management business segment and our banking opera-
tions.

PROPERTY-CASUALTY

Our Property-Casualty insurance businesses are exposed to premium
risk related adverse developments in current year’s new and renewed
business as well as reserve risks related to the business in force.

Premium risk

As part of our Property-Casualty business operations, we receive
premiums from our customers and provide insurance protection in
return. Premium risk is the risk that actual claims for the current year
business develop adversely relative to expected claims ratios. Premi-
um risk can be mitigated by reinsurance as well as by technical excel-
lence in underwriting. Assessing risks as part of the underwriting
process is a key element of our risk management framework. There
are clear underwriting limits and restrictions which are defined cen-
trally and are applied across the Group.

Premium risk is subdivided into three categories: natural catas-
trophe risk, man-made risk, and non-catastrophe risk.

Premium risk is estimated based on actuarial models that are
used to derive loss distributions. Non-catastrophe risks are modeled
using attritional loss models for frequency losses as well as frequen-
cy and severity models for large losses. Natural disasters, such as
earthquakes, storms, and floods, represent a significant challenge
for risk management due to their accumulation potential and occur-
rence volatility. For natural catastrophe risks, we use special model-
ing techniques which combine portfolio data (geographic location,
characteristics of insured objects, and their values) with simulated
natural disaster scenarios to estimate the magnitude and frequency
of potential losses. Where such stochastic models do not exist, we use

‘Cre Rsk Platform.
2_Property-Casualty is also refered to as NortLife
3 Life/Health is also refered to as Life

66

deterministic, scenario-based approaches to estimate potential
losses. Similar approaches are used to evaluate risk concentrations
for man-made catastrophes, including losses from terrorism and
industrial concentrations ete.

These loss distributions are then used within the internal model
to calculate potential losses with a predefined confidence level of
99.5%.

Reserve risk

Reserve risk represents the risk of adverse developments in best-
estimate reserves over a one-year time horizon, resulting from fluctu-
ations in the timing and/or amount of claims settlement. We estimate
and hold reserves for claims resulting from past events that have not
yet been settled. In case of unexpected developments, we will expe-
rience a reserve gain or loss dependent on the assumptions applied
for the estimate.

Similar to premium risk, reserve risk is calculated based on actu-
arial models. The reserve distributions derived are then used within
the internal model to calculate potential losses based on a prede-
fined confidence level of 99.5%.

In order to reduce the risk of unexpected reserve volatility, our
operating entities constantly monitor the development of reserves for
insurance claims on a line-of-business level. In addition, operating
entities generally conduct annual reserve uncertainty analyses based
on similar methods used for reserve risk calculations. The Allianz
Group performs regular independent reviews of these analyses and
Group representatives participate in the local reserve committee
meetings.

LIFE/HEALTH

Underwriting risks in our Life/Health operations (biometric risks)
include mortality, disability, morbidity, and longevity risks. Mortality,
disability, and morbidity risks are associated with the unexpected
increase in the occurrence of death, disability, or medical claims.
Longevity risk is the risk that the reserves covering life annuities and
group pension products might not be sufficient due to longer life
expectancies of the insured.

Life/Health underwriting risk arises from profitability being lower
than expected. As profitability calculations are based on several
parameters — such as historical loss information, assumptions on
inflation, on mortality, or on morbidity — realized parameters may
differ from the ones used for underwriting. For example, higher- than-
expected inflation may lead to higher medical claims in the future.
However, beneficial deviations can also occur; for example, a lower
morbidity rate than expected will most likely result in lower claims.

We measure risks within our internal model, distinguishing,
where appropriate, between risks affecting the absolute level and
trend development of the actuarial assumptions as well as pandemic
risk scenarios. Depending on the nature and complexity of the risk
involved, our health business is represented in the internal model
according to Property-Casualty or Life/Health calculation methods
and is therefore included in the relevant Property-Casualty and
Life/Health figures accordingly. However, most of our health business
is attributable to the Life/Health business segment.

BUSINESS RISK
Business risks include cost risks and policyholder behavior risks, and
are mostly driven by the Life/Health business and to a lesser extent by

‘Annual Report 2027 - Allianz Group


--- Page 34 ---

the Property-Casualty business. Cost risks are associated with the risk
that expenses incurred in administering policies are higher than
expected or that new business volume decreases to a level that does
not allow Allianz to absorb its fixed costs. Business risk is measured
relative to baseline plans.

For the Life/Health business, policyholder behavior risks are risks
related to the unpredictable, adverse behavior of policyholders in
exercising their contractual options, including for example the early
termination of contracts, surrenders, partial withdrawals, renewals,
and annuity take-up options.

Assumptions on policyholder behavior are set in line with ac-
cepted actuarial methods and are based on own historical data
where available. If there is no historical data, assumptions are based
on industry data or expert judgment. This is then used as a basis to
determine the economic impact of policyholder behavior under
different scenarios within our internal model.

OPERATIONAL RISK

Operational risks represent losses resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes and can stem from a wide variety of sources, for
example:

— “Clients, Products & Business Practices” potential losses due to a
failure to meet a professional obligation or from the design of a
product. Examples include misselling, non-compliance with inter-
nal or external requirements related to products, anti-trust behav-
ior, data protection, sanctions and embargoes, etc. These losses
tend to be of a lower frequency but with a potentially high finan-
cial impact.

— “Execution, Delivery and Process Management” potential losses
arising from transaction or process management failures. Exam-
ples include interest and penalties from non-payment or under-
payment of taxes or losses associated with broker and agent dis-
tribution processes. These losses tend to be of a relatively higher
frequency but with a low financial impact (although single large
loss events can occur).

— Other operational risks, including, for example, internal or exter-
nal fraud, financial misstatement risk, a breach of cyber security
causing business disruption or fines, a potential failure at our out-
sourcing partners causing a disruption to our working environ-
ment, etc.

The operational risk capital of the Group is dominated by the risk of
potential losses within the areas of “Clients, Products & Business
Practices” and “Execution, Delivery and Process Management".
Operational risk capital is calculated using a scenario-based
approach based on expert judgement as well as internal and exter-
nal operational loss data. Estimates of frequency and severity of
potential loss events for each material operational risk category are
calculated and used as a basis for our internal model calibration.
Allianz has developed a consistent operational risk manage-
ment framework, which is applied across the Group and focuses on
the early recognition and proactive management of material opera-
tional risks. The framework defines roles and responsibilities as well
as management processes and methods: Local risk managers, in their
capacity as the “second line of defense”, identify and evaluate rele-
vant operational risks and control weaknesses via a dialog with the

Annual Report 2017 - Allianz Group

C_ Group Management Report

“first line of defense“, report operational risk events in a central data-
base, and ensure that the framework is implemented in their respec-
tive operating entity.

This framework triggers specific mitigating control programs. For
example, compliance risks are addressed via written policies and
dedicated compliance programs monitored by the Group Compli-
ance function at Allianz SE. The risk of financial misstatement is miti-
gated by a system of internal controls covering financial reporting.
Outsourcing risks are covered by an Outsourcing Policy, Service Level
Agreements, and Business Continuity and Crisis Management pro-
grams to protect critical business functions from these events. Cyber
risks are mitigated through investments in cyber security and a variety
of ongoing control activities.

OTHER RISKS NOT MODELED IN THE INTERNAL
MODEL

There are certain risks which are not adequately addressed or miti-
gated by additional capital and are therefore excluded from the
internal model. For the identification, analysis, assessment, monitor-
ing, and management of these risks we also use a systematic ap-
proach, with risk assessment generally based on qualitative criteria or
scenario analyses. The most important of these other risks are strate-
gic, liquidity, and reputational risk.

STRATEGIC RISK

Strategic risk is the risk of a decrease in the company’s value arising
from adverse management decisions on business strategies and their
implementation.

Strategic risks are identified and evaluated as part of the Group's
Top Risk Assessment process, and discussed in various Board of Man-
agement-level committees (e.g. Group Finance and Risk Committee).
We also monitor market and competitive conditions, capital market
requirements, regulatory conditions, etc., to decide if strategic ad-
justments are necessary.

The most important strategic risks are directly addressed through
Allianz’s Renewal Agenda, which focuses on True Customer Centricity,
Digital by Default, Technical Excellence, Growth Engines, and Inclu-
sive Meritocracy. Progress on mitigating strategic risks and towards
meeting the Renewal Agenda objectives is monitored and evaluated
as part of the strategic and planning dialog between Allianz Group
and the related undertakings.

LIQUIDITY RISK

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that current or future payment
obligations cannot be met or can only be met on the basis of ad-
versely altered conditions. Liquidity risk can arise primarily if there are
mismatches in the timing of cash in- and out-flows.

Our related undertakings manage liquidity risk locally, using as-
set/ liability management systems designed to ensure that assets and
liabilities are adequately matched. Local investment strategies par-
ticularly focus on the quality of investments and ensure a significant
portion of liquid assets (e.g. high-rated government bonds or covered
bonds) in the portfolios. In the course of liquidity planning, we recon-
cile liquidity sources (e.g. cash from investments and premiums) and
liquidity needs (e.g. payments due to insurance claims and expenses)
under best-estimate plan, as well as under idiosyncratic and systemic
adverse liquidity scenarios, to allow for a group-wide consistent view

67


--- Page 35 ---

‘C_ Group Management Report

on liquidity risks. These analyses are performed at the operating
entity level and are monitored by the Group.

An identical liquidity stress-testing framework is applied to
Allianz SE. Major contingent liquidity requirements include market
risk scenarios for Allianz SE and its subsidiaries, non-availability of
external capital markets, and reinsurance risk scenarios for Allianz SE.

In addition, the accumulated liquidity position of Allianz SE’s
cash pool is monitored and forecast on a daily basis. It is subject to an
absolute minimum strategic cushion amount and an absolute mini-
mum target liquidity amount, while the strategic liquidity planning for
Allianz SE over time horizons of 12 months and three years is report-
ed to the Board of Management regularly and is subject to an abso-
lute minimum target level.

REPUTATIONAL RISK

Allianz’s reputation as a well-respected and socially aware provider
of financial services is influenced by our behavior in a range of areas
such as product quality, corporate governance, financial perfor-
mance, customer service, employee relations, intellectual capital, and
corporate responsibility.

Reputational risk is the risk of an unexpected drop in the value of
the Allianz SE share price, the value of the in-force business, or the
value of future business caused by a decline in our reputation as-
sessed by external stakeholders.

With the support of Group Communications and Corporate Re-
sponsibility (GCORE), Group Compliance, and the ESG Office!, Group
Risk defines sensitive business areas and applicable risk guidelines
that are mandatory for all related undertakings in the Allianz Group.
All Group and local functions affected cooperate in the identification
of reputational risk. GCORE is responsible for risk assessment, which is
based on a group-wide methodology. Since 2015, Allianz has em-
bedded conduct risk triggers for fair products and services into the
reputational risk management process.

The identification and assessment of reputational risks are part
of a yearly Top Risk Assessment, during which senior management
also decides on a risk management strategy and related actions. This
is supplemented by quarterly updates. In addition, reputational risk is
managed on a case-by-case basis. Single cases with a potential
impact on other related undertakings or the Group have to be re-
ported to the Allianz Group for pre-approval.

Internal risk capital framework

We define internal risk capital as the capital required to protect us
against unexpected, extreme economic losses, and which forms the
basis for determining our Solvency II regulatory capitalization. On a
quarterly basis, we calculate and consistently aggregate internal risk
capital across all
requirements on a bi-weekly basis during periods of financial market
turbulence.

GENERAL APPROACH

We utilize an approach for the management of our risk profile and
solvency position that reflects the Solvency II rules, in that it comprises
our approved internal model and covers all major insurance opera-
tions*. Other entities are reflected based on standard formula results
as well as on sectoral or local requirements for non-insurance opera-
tions, in accordance with the Solvency II framework.

INTERNAL MODEL

Our internal model is based on a VaR approach using a Monte Carlo
simulation. Following this approach, we determine the maximum loss
in portfolio value in scope of the model within a specified timeframe
(“holding period", set at one year) and probability of occurrence
(“confidence level”, set at 95.5%). We simulate risk events from all risk
categories (“sources of risk”) modeled and calculate the portfolio
value based on the net fair value of assets minus liabilities, including
risk mitigating measures like reinsurance contracts or derivatives,
under each scenario.

The required risk capital is defined as the difference between the
current portfolio value and the portfolio value under adverse condi-
tions at the 99.5% confidence level. Because we consider the impact
of a negative or positive event on all risk sources and covered busi-
nesses at the same time, diversification effects across products and
regions are taken into account. The results of our Monte Carlo simula-
tion allow us to analyze our exposure to each source of risk both
separately and in aggregate. We also analyze several pre-defined
stress scenarios representing historical events, reverse stress tests, and
adverse scenarios relevant for our portfolio. Furthermore, we conduct
ad-hoc stress tests monthly to reflect current political and financial
developments or to analyze a non-financial risk category more deeply.

COVERAGE OF THE RISK CAPITAL CALCULATIONS
Allianz's group internal model to calculate the solvency capital re-
quirement covers all major insurance operations?. This includes the
relevant assets (including fixed income, equities, real estate, and
derivatives) and liabilities (including the run-off of all current and
planned technical provisions as well as deposits, issued debt and
other liabilities). For with-profit products in the Life/Health business
segment, options and guarantees embedded in insurance contracts —
including policyholder behavior - are taken into account.*

Smaller related undertakings within the European Economic Ar-
ea which are not covered by the group internal model are reflected
with their standard formula results. At Group level, the solvency capi-
tal requirements for smaller insurance undertakings outside the
European Economic Area with only an immaterial impact on the
Group's risk profile are accounted for by means of book value deduc-
tion®

Risk capital related to our European banking operations is allo-
cated to the Corporate and Other business segment, based on the
approach applied by banks in accordance with the local require-
ments resulting from the Basel regulation (Basel standards). Capital
requirements for banks represent an insignificant amount of approx-

imately 1.7% (2016: 1.7%) of our total pre-diversified Group solvency
requirement. Therefore, risk management with respect to banking
operations is not discussed in more detail.

For our Asset Management business segment, we assign internal
risk capital requirements based on sectorial regulatory capital re-
quirements. The Asset Management business is mainly affected by
operational risks. However, since most of our Asset Management
business is not located within the Eurozone, at Group level its partici-
pation value bears a foreign exchange rate risk. Our Asset Manage-
ment business is covered by adequate risk controlling processes,
including qualitative risk assessments (such as the Top Risk Assess-
ment) and regular reporting to the Group. As the impact on the
Group's total solvency requirement is minor, risk management with
respect to Asset Management is not discussed in more detail.

Therefore Allianz’s risk capital framework covers all material and
quantifiable risks. Risks specifically not covered by our group internal
model include reputational, liquidity, and strategic risks.

ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

RISK-FREE RATE AND VOLATILITY ADJUSTMENT

When calculating the fair values of assets and liabilities, the assump-
tions regarding the underlying risk-free yield curve are crucial in
determining and discounting future cash flows. We apply the meth-
odology provided by the European Insurance and Occupational
Pensions Authority (EIOPA) within the technical documentation (El-
OPA-BoS-15/035) for the extrapolation of the risk-free interest rate
curves beyond the last liquid tenor.

In addition, we adjust the risk-free yield curves by a volatility ad-
justment in most markets where a volatility adjustment is defined by
EIOPA and approved by the local regulator. This is done to better
reflect the underlying economics of our business, as the cash flows of
our insurance liabilities are largely predictable. The advantage of
being a long-term investor, therefore, is the opportunity to invest in
bonds yielding spreads over the risk-free return and earning this
additional yield component over the duration of the bonds. Being a
long-term investor mitigates much of the risk of forced selling of debt
instruments at a loss prior to maturity.

We therefore take account of this by applying volatility adjust-
ment to mitigate the credit spread risk, which we consider to be less
substantial than the default risk.

VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS: REPLICATING
PORTFOLIOS

We replicate the liabilities of our Life/Health insurance business as
well as for our internal pension obligations. This technique enables us
to represent all product-related options and guarantees, both con-
tractual and discretionary, by means of standard financial instru-
ments. In the risk calculation we use the replicating portfolio to de-
termine and revalue these liabilities under all potentially adverse
Monte Carlo scenarios.

1 Due to late availabilty of EIOPA publication, the risk-free interest rate term structure used might slightly differ from the
‘one published by EIOPA.

Annual Report 2017 - Allianz Group

C_ Group Management Report

DIVERSIFICATION AND CORRELATION ASSUMPTIONS
Our internal model considers concentration, accumulation, and corre-
lation effects when aggregating results at Group level. The resulting
diversification reflects the fact that not all potential worst-case losses
are likely to materialize at the same time. As we are an integrated
financial services provider offering a variety of products across differ-
ent business segments and geographic regions, diversification is key
to our business model.

Diversification typically occurs when looking at combined risks
that are not, or only partly, interdependent. Important diversification
factors include regions (e.g. windstorm in Australia vs. windstorm in
Germany), risk categories (e.g. market risk vs. underwriting risk), and
subcategories within the same risk category (e.g. commercial vs.
personal lines of property and casualty risk). Ultimately, diversification
is driven by the specific features of the investment or insurance prod-
ucts in question and their respective risk exposures. For example, an
operational risk event at an Australian entity can be considered to be
highly independent of a change in credit spreads for a French gov-
ernment bond held by a German entity.

Where possible, we derive correlation parameters for each pair
of market risks through statistical analysis of historical data, consider-
ing quarterly observations over more than a decade. In case histori-
cal data or other portfolio-specific observations are insufficient or not
available, correlations are set by the Correlation Settings Committee,
which combines the expertise of risk and business experts in a well-
defined and controlled process. In general, when using expert judg-
ment we set the correlation parameters to represent the joint move-
ment of risks under adverse conditions. Based on these correlations,
we use an industry-standard approach, the Gaussian copula, to
determine the dependency structure of quantifiable sources of risk
within the applied Monte Carlo simulation.

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

Our internal model also includes assumptions on claims trends, liabil-
ity inflation, mortality, longevity, morbidity, policyholder behavior,
expense, etc. We use our own internal historical data for actuarial
assumptions wherever possible, and also consider recommendations
from the insurance industry, supervisory authorities, and actuarial
associations. The derivation of our actuarial assumptions is based on
generally accepted actuarial methods. Within our internal risk capital
and financial reporting framework, comprehensive processes and
controls exist for ensuring the reliability of these assumptions.

MODEL LIMITATIONS

As the internal model is based on a 99.5% confidence level, there is a
low statistical probability of 0.5% that actual losses could exceed this
threshold at Group level in the course of one year.

We use model and scenario parameters derived from historical
data, where available, to characterize future possible risk events. If
future market conditions differ substantially from the past, for exam-
ple in an unprecedented crisis, our VaR approach may be too con-
servative or too liberal in ways that are difficult to predict. In order to
mitigate reliance on historical data, we complement our VaR analysis
with stress testing.

Furthermore, we validate the model and parameters through
sensitivity analyses, independent internal peer reviews and, where
appropriate, independent external reviews, focusing on methods for

69

‘C_ Group Management Report

selecting parameters and control processes. To ensure proper valida-
tion we established an Independent Validation Unit (IVU) within
Group Risk, responsible for validating our internal model within a
comprehensive model validation process. Overall, we believe that our
validation efforts are effective and that the model adequately as-
sesses the risks to which we are exposed.

The construction and application of the replicating portfolios
mentioned are subject to the set of available replicating instruments
and might be too simple or restrictive to capture all factors affecting
the change in value of liabilities. As with other model components,
the replications are subject to independent validation and to suitabil-
ity assessments as well as to stringent data and process quality con-
trols. Therefore, we believe that the liabilities are adequately repre-
sented by the replicating portfolios.

Since the internal model takes into account the change in the
economic fair value of our assets and liabilities, it is crucial to esti-
mate the market value of each item accurately. For some assets and
liabilities it may be difficult, if not impossible — notably in distressed
financial markets — to either obtain a current market price or apply a
meaningful mark-to-market approach. For such assets we apply a
mark-to-model approach. For some of our liabilities, the accuracy of
their values also depends on the quality of the actuarial cash flow
estimates. Despite these limitations, we believe the estimated fair
values are appropriately assessed.

MODEL CHANGES IN 2017

In 2017, our internal model has been adjusted based on regulatory
developments, validation of our model, and assessment of its appro-
priateness, as well as feedback received during the ongoing consulta-
tions with regulators. For the sake of clarity, all model changes and
the resulting impacts on our risk profile are presented jointly within
this section, based on data as of 31 December 2016.

The net impact of model changes in 2017 was € (82) mn. Be-
hind this small net result were larger, offsetting impacts: risk capital
increased by €2 bn due to a change in real world credit spread
scenarios and stochastic cash flow models for selected life entities,
offset by favorable changes for own pensions, the inclusion of nega-
tive interest rate scenarios, and various minor and immaterial model
changes.

We also updated the approach used for allocating risk capital to
business segments and related undertakings by aligning it with the
contributions derived from the tail scenarios underpinning our Group
risk capital requirements. As a consequence, financial market risk
categories (especially in the Life/Health segment) tend to be allocat-
ed more risk capital because they diversify less “in the tail’ while the
other risk categories are generally allocated less risk capital as they
diversify more “in the tail”.

In all subsequent sections, the figures including model changes
will form the basis for the movement analysis of our risk profile in
2017

hanges were allocated proportionally.

In 2017, the changes to our internal model focused on the following
risk categories:

MARKET RISK

Market risk was significantly affected by the negative interest rate,
the credit spread, and the new cash flow model changes. The com-
bined impact of the model changes on the total market risk was an
increase of € 3.4 bn to € 24.9 bn (2016: € 21.5 bn).

CREDIT RISK

In 2017, the central credit risk model was changed to allow for a
more granular and accurate valuation of exposures in a negative
interest rate environment. Consistent with market expectations, coun-
terparties from segments with very low or even negative credit
spread levels now carry less credit risk. The credit-risk-reducing effect
of this major model change was partially offset by indirect effects

70

from cash flow model changes which reduced the policyholder par-
ticipation in the Life/Health business segment.

Other immaterial credit risk model changes introduced in 2017
were mainly related to the introduction of new internal rating models
for specific asset classes.

UNDERWRITING RISK

Property-Casualty

The increase in underwriting risk in the Property-Casualty business
segment was mainly based on the central changes on natural catas-
trophe modelling for windstorms in Europe and earthquakes in Ger-
many.

Life/Health
The considerable decrease
Life/Health business segment was mainly driven by the new alloca-

tion approach (€ (0.7) bn). There was no central model change per-
formed in 2017 for the Life/Health underwriting risk and the local
changes for this module were either minor or immaterial. The remain-
ing impact therefore results from changes that affect the local cash
flow models, in particular the introduction of the negative interest
rate modeling and a new local cash flow model.

BUSINESS RISK

As for Life/Health underwriting risk, there was no central model
change performed in 2017 for the business risk and all local changes
for this module were either minor or immaterial.

OPERATIONAL RISK
No material operational risk model change has been applied in
2017.

IMPACT OF MODEL CHANGES ON ELIGIBLE GROUP
OWN FUNDS

Model changes in 2017 resulted in a € 3.0 bn increase of Own Funds,
mainly driven by regulatory and model changes including negative
interest rate model.

Allianz risk profile and management assessment

RISK PROFILE AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT

As mentioned earlier, the Allianz Group is exposed to a variety of risks.
The largest risks in terms of their contribution to Allianz’s risk profile
are:

— Market risk, especially interest rate risk, due to the duration
mismatch between assets and liabilities for long-term savings
products, equity risk, credit, and credit spread risks driven by
assets backing long-term liabilities, which we take to benefit from
the expected risk premium;

—  Property-casualty premium and reserve risks resulting from
natural and man-made catastrophes as well as from claims
uncertainty.

The risk profile and relative contributions have changed in 2017,
predominantly due to changes in the market environment as well as
to management actions such as the decrease in asset durations, the
reduction of exposures to some sovereign bond investments, and the
significant increase in exposures to real estate and infrastructure
investments.

POTENTIAL RISKS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKET AND IN
OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

Financial markets are characterized by historically low interest
rates and risk premiums, prompting investors to look for higher-
yielding — and potentially higher-risk — investments. In addition to
sustained low interest rates, the challenges of implementing long-
term structural reforms in key Eurozone countries and the uncertainty
about the future path of monetary policy may lead to increasing
market volatility. This could be accompanied by a flight to quality,
combined with falling equity and bond prices due to rising spread
levels, even in the face of potentially lower interest rates. Also, possi-

C_ Group Management Report

ble asset bubbles (as observed in the Chinese equity market) might
spill over to other markets, or rising geopolitical tensions — e.g. caused
by the North Korean missile program — might trigger market sell-offs,
which would contribute to increasing volatility. We therefore continue
to closely monitor political and financial developments — such as the
Brexit in the United Kingdom, the European migrant crisis and the rise
of Euroscepticism, or the situation on the Korean peninsula — in order
to manage our overall risk profile to specific event risks.

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

Following the approval of our internal model in November 2015, the
model has been fully applied since the beginning of 2016. There is
still uncertainty about the future capitalization requirements of
Allianz, since the future capital requirements applicable for Global
Systemically Important Insurers (so-called G-SII) are yet to be final-
ized. Due to the review of the Solvency Il framework by EIOPA, future
Solvency Il capital requirements might change depending on the
outcome. Finally, the potential for a multiplicity of different regulatory
regimes, capital standards, and reporting requirements will increase
operational complexity and costs.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT

The Allianz Group's management feels comfortable with the Group's
overall risk profile and has confidence in the effectiveness of its risk
management framework to meet both, the challenges of a rapidly
changing environment and the day-to-day business needs. This con-
fidence is based on several factors, which are summarized below:

— Due to its effective capital management, the Allianz Group is well
capitalized and met its internal, rating agency, and regulatory
solvency targets as of 31 December 2017. Allianz is also confident
that it will be able to meet the capital requirements under new
regulatory regimes. Allianz remains one of the highest rated in-
surance groups in the world, as reflected by our external ratings.

— The Group's management also believes that Allianz is well posi-
tioned to deal with potentially adverse future events — due, in
part, to our strong internal limit framework, which is defined by
the Group's risk appetite, and our risk management practices
which include our approved internal model.

— The Group has a conservative investment profile and disciplined
business practices in the Property-Casualty, Life/Health, and Asset
Management business segments, leading to sustainable operat-
ing earnings with a well-balanced risk-return profile.

— Finally, the Group has the additional advantage of being well-
diversified, both geographically and across a broad range of
businesses and products.

Compared to year-end 2016, our Solvency Il capitalization increased
by 11 percentage points to 229 % (2016: 218%). This was driven by an
increase in Own Funds and an overall decrease in the Solvency II
capital requirement. The increase in the Solvency Il capitalization
ratio was mainly due to strong Solvency Il earnings and favorable
markets that were characterized by higher interest rates, lower credit
spreads, and rising equities. Model changes also contributed to the
increase of the capitalization ratio. These positive impacts were partly
offset by capital management activities like the share buy-backs as
well as the dividend accrual throughout the year. Management
actions such as the acquisition of Liverpool Victoria (LV=) and part of
the non-controlling interests of Euler Hermes, the decrease in expo-
sures to some government bonds, and the improvement of our inter-
est rate risk profile had further compensating effects. Other effects
such as taxes, changes in transferability restrictions, and diversifica-
tion effects contributed to a further reduction of the Solvency II capi-
talization ratio.

Quantifiable risks and opportunities by risk
category

This Risk and Opportunity Report outlines the Group's risk figures,
reflecting its risk profile based on pre-diversified risk figures and
group diversification effects.

At the Allianz Group, we measure and steer risk based on an
approved internal model, under which we derive our risk capital from
potential adverse developments of Own Funds. The resulting risk
profile provides an overview of how risks are distributed over different
risk categories, and determines the regulatory capital requirements in
accordance with Solvency Il.

With the exception of the Asset Management business segment,
all business segments are exposed to the full range of risk categories
stated. As mentioned earlier, the Asset Management business seg-
ment is predominantly exposed to operational and market risks and
toa lesser extent to credit risk.

The pre-diversified risk figures reflect the diversification effect
within each modeled risk category (i.e. market, credit, underwriting,
business, and operational risk) but do not include the diversification
effects across risk categories. Group-diversified risk figures also cap-
ture the diversification effect across all risk categories.

The following sections explain the evolution of our risk profile per risk
category modeled. All risks are presented on a pre-diversified basis
and concentrations of single sources of risk are discussed accordingly.

As of 31 December 2017, the group-diversified risk capital, re-
flecting our risk profile before non-controlling interests, amounting to
€ 33.3 bn (2016: € 34.6 bn) represented a stable diversification bene-
fit’ of approximately 25% compared to 2016. The drop in Solvency II
capital requirement was mainly due to favorable market develop-

ments, specifically an increase in interest rates and a tightening of
credit spreads. Management actions predominantly driven by M&A.
transactions increased the SCR, which was mostly offset by the con-
tribution of business evolution.

1.2016 risk profile figures recalculated based on model changes in 2017 and the impact of minor and immaterial model changes were allocated proportionally.

Our total pre-diversified market risk showed a decrease of € 3.3 bn,
which was mainly driven by interest rate and credit spread risk in the
Life/Health business segment. The decrease in interest rate risk was
driven by the significant increase in the rates as well as by manage-
ment actions to improve our interest rate risk profile by asset/liability
management measures. For credit spread risk, the decrease was
driven by narrowing credit spreads observed in financial markets and
the increase in policyholder participation in the Life/Health business
segment. These were also supported by exposure changes due to
ALM measures and the corresponding effects on the liability side.

Throughout 2017, the credit environment remained stable. Overall
credit risk for the Group decreased compared to last year, primarily
driven by an increase of policyholder participation in the Life/Health
business segment as a result of better market conditions. Annual

updates based on extended time series were performed for credit risk

CREDIT RISK - INVESTMENTS

As of 31 December 2017, the credit risk arising from our investment
portfolio accounted for 85.2% (2016: 86.4%) of our total Group pre-
diversified internal credit risk*

Credit risk in the Life/Health business segment is primarily driven
by long-term assets covering long-term liabilities. Typical investments
are government bonds, senior corporate bonds, covered bonds, self-
originated mortgages and loans, and a modest amount of deriva-
tives. In the Property-Casualty business segment, fixed-income securi-
ties tend to be short- to mid-term, due to the nature of the business,
which explains the lower credit risk consumption in this segment.

The counterparty credit risk arising from derivatives is low, since
derivatives usage is governed by the group-wide internal guidelines
for collateralization of derivatives, which stipulates master netting
and collateral agreements with each counterparty and requires high-
quality and liquid collateral. In addition, Allianz closely monitors the
credit ratings of counterparties and exposure movements.

As of 31 December 2017, the rating distribution based on issue
(instrument) ratings of our fixed-income portfolio was as follows:

As of 31 December 2017, 9.6% (2016: 7.4%) of our total Group pre-

insurance exposures, for which the relative increase is primarily driven
by the lower credit risk of the investment portfolio.

- of which 51.8% (2016: 46.8%) was related to reinsurance counter-
parties in the United States and Germany.

As of 31 December 2017, 67.8% (2016: 84.0%) of the Allianz
Group's reinsurance recoverables were distributed among reinsurers
that had been assigned at least an “A-" rating. The non-rated reinsur-
ance recoverables represented 30.1% (2016: 15.1%).

The increase in total and non-rated exposure mainly results from
the inclusion of reinsurance captive exposures in the rating overview

1 Additionally, 4.5 % (2016: 5.7 %) of our total Group pre-diversified internal creit risk is allocated to receivables, potential
future exposure for derivatives and reinsurance, and other off-balance sheet exposures,

PROPERTY-CASUALTY

During 2017, the total of the stand-alone underwriting risk capital on
a Group-diversified basis increased by € 0.2 bn. This slight increase is
mainly driven by exposure and model updates as well as discounting
effects. The remaining difference is due to diversification effects with
other underwriting risk categories.

Overall, the underwriting risk profile for the Allianz Group is not
expected to change materially as we do not plan to significantly
change our underwriting standards (Allianz Standard for P&C Un-
derwriting), or our Group natural catastrophe man-made or terror risk
appetite (i.e. retrocession reinsurance strategy).

The loss ratios for the Property-Casualty business segment can
be seen in the following table:

Annual Report 2017 - Allianz Group

The top three perils contributing to the natural catastrophe risk as of
31 December 2017 were: windstorms in Europe, floods in Germany,
and earthquakes in Australia.

LIFE/HEALTH
The risk capital contribution from biometric risk increased by € 0.1 bn
compared to the previous year (after considering model changes).
This is mainly due to the annual calibration update of the stochastic
longevity risk model. The impact of this model update for the Proper-
ty-Casualty and the Corporate business segments is mainly generat-
ed by the longevity risk of the corresponding pension schemes.

Due to effective product design and the diversity of our products,
there were no significant concentrations of underwriting risks within
our Life/Health business segment.

BUSINESS RISK

There was no significant impact on the overall business risk from
regular model updates or the evolution of our business. The business
risk contribution remained stable at € 4.4 bn.

OPERATIONAL RISK

The marginal decrease shown in the operational risk was driven by
the annual regular update of local parameters. Foreign currency
exchange effects played a secondary role.

CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The following information is provided pursuant to § 289(4) and
§ 315(4) of the German Commercial Code (“Handelsgesetzbuch —
HGB")

In line with both our prudent approach to risk governance and
compliance with regulatory requirements, we have created a struc-
ture to identify and mitigate the risk of material errors in our consoli-
dated financial statements (this also includes our market value bal-
ance sheet and risk capital controls). Our system of internal control
over financial reporting (ICOFR) is regularly reviewed and updated.
ICOFR is split into an Entity-Level Control Assessment Process (ELCA),
IT General Controls (ITGC) and controls at process levels. The ELCA
framework contains controls to monitor the system of governance
effectiveness. In the ITGC framework we have implemented, for ex-
ample, controls for access right management and for project and
change management. Going forward, the current ICOFR framework
will be part of an Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS). The
IRCS is split into three main components: Reporting Risk (currently
ICOFR), Compliance Risk, and Operational Risk.

ACCOUNTING AND CONSOLIDATION PROCESSES

The accounting and consolidation processes we use to produce con-
solidated financial statements are based on a central consolidation
and reporting IT solution and local general ledger solutions. The
latter are largely harmonized throughout the Group, using standard-
ized processes, master data, posting logics, and interfaces for data
delivery to the Holding. Access rights to accounting systems are man-
aged according to strict authorization procedures.

Accounting rules for the classification, valuation, and disclosure
of all items in the balance sheet, the income statement, and notes
related to the annual and interim financial statements are defined
primarily in our Group accounting manual. Internal controls are em-
bedded in the accounting and consolidation processes to safeguard
the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the information pro-
vided in our financial statements.

INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM APPROACH

Our approach can be summarized as follows:

— We use a top-down, risk-based approach to determine the ac-
counts and operating entities that should fall under the scope of
our system of internal control over financial reporting (as well as
IRCS). The methodology is described in our ICOFR manual and
the IRCS Guideline. During the scoping process, both materiality
and susceptibility to a misstatement are considered simultane-
ously. In addition to the quantitative calculation, we also consider
qualitative criteria —- such as expected increase in business vol-
ume — which are provided by different Group Centers, Group Au-
dit, and external Audit.

— Then, our local entities identify risks that could lead to material
financial misstatements, including all relevant root causes (i.e.
human processing errors, fraud, system shortcomings, external
factors, etc.).

— Preventive and detective key controls to address financial report-
ing risks have been put in place to reduce the likelihood and im-
pact of financial misstatements. If a potential risk materializes,

Annual Report 2017 - Allianz Group

actions are taken to reduce the impact of the financial misstate-
ment. Given the strong dependence of financial reporting pro-
cesses on information technology systems, we also implement IT
controls.

— Finally, we focus on ensuring that controls are appropriately
designed and effectively executed to mitigate risk. We have set
consistent documentation requirements across the Allianz Group
for elements such as processes, related key controls, and execu-
tion. We conduct an annual assessment of our control system to
maintain and continuously enhance its effectiveness. Group Audit
and local internal audit functions ensure that the overall quality
of our control system is subjected to regular control-testing, to as-
sure reasonable design and operating effectiveness. Internal Au-
dit does so through a comprehensive risk-based approach, which
assesses the key controls of the company’s internal procedures
and processes, including local and group-internal controls over
financial reporting risks, from an integrated perspective.

GOVERNANCE

Responsibility for ensuring the completeness, accuracy, and reliability
of our consolidated financial statements rests with the Chairman of
the Allianz SE Board of Management, as well as the board member
responsible for Finance, Controlling, and Risk, supported by Group
Center functions, the Group Disclosure Committee, and operating
entities

The Group Disclosure Committee ensures that these board
members are made aware of all material information that could
affect our disclosures, and assesses the completeness and accuracy
of the information provided in the quarterly statements, half-year,
and annual financial reports as well as in the Solvency II qualitative
reports. In 2017, the Group Disclosure Committee met on a quarterly
basis before the quarterly statements and financial reports were
issued. An additional meeting was held prior to issuance of the Sol-
vency II qualitative reports.

Subsidiaries within the scope of our control system are individual-
ly responsible for adhering to the Group's internal governance and
control policy and for creating local Disclosure Committees that are
similar to the Group-level committee. The entities’ CEOs and CFOs
provide periodic sign-offs to the management of Allianz SE, certifying
the effectiveness of their local systems of internal control as well as
the completeness, accuracy, and reliability of financial data reported
to the Holding
