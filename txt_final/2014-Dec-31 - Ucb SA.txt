REGULATORY UPDATE AND PIPELINE PROGRESS

NEUROLOGY

In September 2014, Vimpat® (lIacosamide) was
approved in the U.S. as monotherapy in the
treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults with
epilepsy. The U.S. authorities also approved a new
single loading dose administration option for all
formulations of Vimpat®.

In October 2014, UCB reported positive results for
the Phase 3 study evaluating Vimpat® as adjunctive
therapy in the treatment of Japanese and Chinese
adult patients with partial-onset seizures. Regulatory
submissions in Japan and China are planned in
2015. To support this expansion, in November 2014,
UCB entered into an agreement with Daiichi Sankyo
to jointly commercialize lacosamide in Japan.
Vimpat® is scheduled to move into Phase 3
development for primary generalized tonic-clonic
seizures (PGTCS) in H1 2015.

In July 2014, positive topline results from the latest
Phase 3 study with brivaracetam showed reduced
partial-onset seizure frequency and improved
responder rates, both with statistical significance. This
study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety
of brivaracetam compared to placebo, as adjunctive
treatment in adult epilepsy patients with partial-
onset seizures, not fully controlled despite treatment
with one or two concomitant antiepileptic drugs. In
January 2015, the U.S. and EU regulatory authorities
have accepted for review the new drug application and
the marketing authorization application respectively
for brivaracetam as adjunctive therapy for the
treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients from

16 years of age with epilepsy.

In December 2014, UCB0942 (PPSI), a small molecule
in development for highly drug resistant epilepsy

is scheduled to start Phase 2 proof of concept study
in H2 2015.

NEUROLOGY — AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE

world-wide collaboration in the development of a
small molecule disease modifying treatment option
for people living with Parkinson's disease. A Phase 1
study is scheduled to start in 2015.

In February 2015, UCB announced positive top-line
results from two Phase 3 studies evaluating Neupro®
(rotigotine transdermal patch) in the treatment

of patients in China with early- and advanced-

stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Regulatory
submission is planned in 2015.

In February 2015, the Japanese regulatory authorities
approved E Keppra® as monotherapy in the treatment
of partial-onset seizures in people living with epilepsy
aged four years and above.

IMMUNOLOGY

In January 2014, the New England Journal of
Medicine published results from a Phase 2 trial
evaluating romosozumab in postmenopausal women
with low bone mass that showed, compared with
placebo, significant increases in bone mineral density
at spine, hip and femoral neck. The Phase 3 program
evaluating romosozumab in postmenopausal
osteoporosis (PMO) is ongoing as planned with initial
results expected in H1 2016.

In June 2014, first patients were enrolled in

a Phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety

of romosozumab in men with osteoporosis and

high risk of fracture; first results from this study

are expected in H2 2016.

Dapirolizumab pegol (CDP7657), an anti-CD40L
pegylated Fab being developed in systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) jointly with Biogen Idec,

3.9| BALANCE SHEET

The intangible assets decreased by € 93 million from
€ 1312 million at 31 December 2013 to € 1219 million
at 31 December 2014. This includes the on-going
amortization of the intangible assets (€ 168 million)
mainly related to the acquisition of Celltech and
Schwarz Pharma, impairment (€ 38 million), the
increasing U.S. dollar and British pound, partially offset
by additions through in-licencing deals and assets
held for sale.

Goodwill amounts € 4 882 million or a € 188 million
increase between 31 December 2013 and

31 December 2014 due to the increasing U.S. dollar
and British pound, offset with assets held for sale.

Other non-current assets increased by € 216 million,
mainly driven by an increase in deferred tax assets due
to further recognition of losses in two tax jurisdictions.

The current asset increase from € 2 424 million

as of 31 December 2013 to € 2 501 million as of
31 December 2014 stems from assets held for sale
related to the KU divestment, offset with a cash
decrease cash.

UCB's shareholders’ equity, at € 4 842 million, an
increase of € 519 million between 31 December 2013
and 31 December 2014. The important changes
stem from the net profit after non-controlling
interest (€ 199 million), positive currency translation
(€ 258 million), offset with IAS 19 valuations

(€ 128 million), the dividend payments (€ 222 million)
and the capital increase (€ 460 million).

The non-current liabilities amount € 2 970 million,

a decrease of € 122 million, stems from the conversion
of the convertible bond, offset with the increase

of employee benefits related to IAS 19 and other
financial liabilities.

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The current liabilities amounts € 2 336 million including
the maturing retail bond, offset with new loans, higher
trade payables and liabilities held for sale related to the
KU divestment.

The net debt decreased by € 387 million from

€ 1998 million as of end December 2013 to

€ 1611 million as of end December 2014, and relates
to the conversion of the convertible bond, dividend
payment on the 2013 results and the dividend related
to the perpetual subordinated bond, offset by the
underlying net profitability.

3.10 | CASH FLOW STATEMENT

The evolution of cash flow generated by
biopharmaceuticals activities is affected
by the following:

Cash flow from operating activities amounted

€ 512 million compared to € 288 million in 2013.
Thereof, cash flow from continuing operations
amounted to € 497 million after € 267 million in 2013.
The increase stems mainly from the underlying net
profitability and improved working capital offset with
higher taxes paid during the period.

Cash flow from investing activities showed an
outflow of € 161 million in 2014 compared to
€ 288 million in 2013, including the committed
investments in the biological plant in Bulle
(Switzerland) and in-licencing deals.

Cash flow from financing activities has an outflow

of € 595 million, which includes the repayment

of the retail bond, the dividend paid to the UCB
shareholders and the shareholders of the perpetual
subordinated bond offset with the second installment
received from the European Investment Bank and
Belgian Commercial Papers.

3.11| OUTLOOK 2015
