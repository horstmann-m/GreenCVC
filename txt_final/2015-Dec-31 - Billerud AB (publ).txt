market chains in more than 100 countries.

Innovation a priority area

We challenge conventional packaging by leading industry development and bringing new

boundary of what paper-based products can be used for.

Clear growth strategy

BillerudKorsnis will grow faster than the market for packaging paper and board.

We will achieve this by shifting our position geographically and in the value chain,
developing new products, making our production more efficient and offering sustainab
alternatives.

takes place in resource-efficient oduction units that are constantly improved to minimise
their environmental impact. Our products and solutions often assist in solving many of the
challenges that the world currently faces.

Focus on long-term value for shareholders

The roup’s current financial st ength allows for investment in its own structure as well as
strategic acquisitions. BillerudKorsnis’ target is to generate a 13% return on capital employed
and distribute 50% of net profit to sha eholders as dividends.

BILLERUDKORSNAS

CEO’S STATEMENT

2015 was a year that once again clearly showed BillerudKorsnas’ capacity to build value for customers,
shareholders and partners. Despite some disruptions to production in the fourth quarter, the year has
been successful overall. We were true to our word: we achieved our profit targets, continued the
integration work, made advances in the market and saw good results in the development portfolio.

The company is strong and the mood across the organisation is good.

TARGETS EXCEEDED,

NEW ONES SET

All the financial targets ere achieved

— operating margin, return on capital
employed and net debt/equity ratio — plus
the dividend target and our new target for
long-term growth of 34% per year. The
weakness of the Swedish krona naturally
aided the situation, but I am nonetheless
very happy with the performance.

Over the year we have established new
financial targets that will apply f om 2016.
The n w targets have been set on the basis
of growing stability in the underlying results
that BillerudKorsnas has posted in recent
years and should be seen as the baseline
that is to be achieved regardless of the
economic cycle.

INNOVATION TOOK OFF

Over the year, we continued our focus on
innovation aimed at adding value for the
customer, generating strategic competitive
advantages for us and contributing to a
lower environmental impact in society.
Since 2013, we have increased the number
of projects fi efold, doubled the number of
employees in research and development and
increased investments by 180%.

We have an ambitious target that 20%
of our turnover will be generated by new
products by the year 2020. Although our
current percentage is close to that target, it
will take major development initiatives to
maintain that high level in the future.

BREAKTHROUGH FOR SYSTEMS
Alongside our traditional product develop-
ment, which has further contributed to
profitable g owth, we are also focusing on
the development of new service concepts
and business models. Over the year, we have
worked further on integrating the business
model for “Managed packaging” into the

Containerboard business area, which is now
changing its name to Corrugated Solutions.
Other concrete examples include invest-
ment in value-adding systems, which made
their breakthrough during the year: two
systems for FreeForm Packaging and two
systems for Axello Zap were brought to
market in 2015. This is a brand n w way
of advancing up the value chain, which
involves BillerudKorsnis working with
machine suppliers to develop optimal
packagies for the customer's needs, based
on our materials and solutions. A total
solution for our customers.

CONTINUED EXPANSION

In parallel with the expansion in the value
chain, we strengthened our local presence

in growth markets, particularly in Asia but
also in Africa. New sales offices ere opened
in Istanbul and Durban.

SUSTAINABILITY INTEGRAL
Our sustainability work was recognised on
many fronts over the year, not least by
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) which
put us in the top category of companies
demonstrating global leadership in climate
improvement measures. When it comes to our
role as an attractive employer, we are also
coming higher and higher in various rankings.
Since our products — paper and board
for packaging — are based on raw material
from growing forests, BillerudKorsnis is
part of the solution to many of the world’s
major challenges in the area of sustainability.
Packing goods in paper instead of fossil
plastics or metals saves finite esources. We
also drive sustainability issues throughout
our value chain, together with customers,
suppliers and partners. We aim to maximise
our positive contribution to a sustainable
future and minimise the negative impact of
our business.

DISRUPTIONS TO PRODUCTION

The compan ’s substantial programme of
investment in production to increase capacity,
quality and sustainability continued over
the year. However, these rebuilds and
expansions have also created their own
problems. Following complex rebuilds, it has
taken time to get back to normal production,
sometimes longer than planned. This was
unfortunately particularly evident during
Q4 in Frovi.

‘As a consequence of this, in 2016 we
will be limiting the number of major invest-
ments, in order to allow those already
implemented to reach planned capacity and
performance levels. Another lesson is that
we must be even more meticulous in our
investment planning and develop the partner-
ship with our contractors.

MAJOR NEW INVESTMENTS
During the year, we took the decision to
close the non-integrated production in
Tervasaari, Finland. This was a tough dec-
sion, not least because the local team has
worked particularly hard to improve profit -
bility. Unfortunately, this was not enough
to resolve the issue. We are instead now
investigating the possibility of moving the
machine to Skarblacka, in order to secure
that production unit’s position as one of the
most efficient in the world in white M
paper. In the long term, the closure and the
potential move will improve the structure and
margins of the Packaging Paper business area.
We are now conducting a feasibility
study into adding a new board machine in
Gruvén, to increase long-term capacity in
the Consumer Board business area. This
would improve the production structure
and profitability ac oss the Group and make
it possible to grow in line with the strategy
for Consumer Board.

PAVED WAY FOR ACQUISITIONS

The compan ’s low and steadily falling levels
of debt provide a strong foundation for
future opportunities, in terms of both
organic growth and acquisitions. What
could be of interest would be acquisitions of
businesses in the same part of the value
chain as BillerudKorsnis. The long-term
priority is to find businesses outside
Sweden, in order to reduce currency
exposure. However, the weak Swedish
krona, combined with high valuations,
means that acquisitions outside Sweden are
hard to justify at this moment in time.
Right now, we are therefore looking at
smaller, complementary acquisitions, which
I believe could hold great potential.

MAKE A CONCRETE DIFFERENCE

Ic is naturally a real challenge to keep the
whole company on track with all the develop-
ments that are now occurring on many levels
in parallel with regular operations. We want
to improve on every front: sustainability,
innovation, market position and efficien .
To make everything better. And this is
realised through our employees, through
diversity and cooperation.

The guiding light for e erything Billerud-
Korsnis does is to challenge. We challenge
conventional packaging, we challenge existing
business models and we challenge ourselves.
Many companies talk about innovation,
sustainability and development, us included,
our results show that we can make a real
diffe ence. And in so doing, we continue to

P,

create added value for customers, owners,
partners and society.

I would like to extend my thanks to our
customers, owners and partners for their
trust and loyalty, and to our employees for
their great work during the year.

Directors’ Report

The Board and CEO of BillerudKorsnas AB (publ), corporate identity number 556025-5001, herewith submit the
annual report and the consolidated annual accounts for the 2015 financial year. Figures for the previous year are
stated in brackets, 2015 (2014). This English version is a translation of the Swedish original.

BillerudKorsnas’ operating profit imp oved in 2015 to SEK 2 586
million. This was SEK 685 million, or 36%, higher than in 2014.
The inc ease was mainly due to the sale of the pellet business in
Latvia (SIA Latgran) and a weaker Swedish krona. The decision was
taken to close the non-integrated Finnish production at Tervasaari,
and to examine the possibility of moving the machine to Skarblacka.

Market

BillerudKorsnis offers the global packaging ma ket innovative and
sustainable products and services. The roup has a leading position in
primary fib e-based packaging paper and cartonboard. The packagin
market is showing continued positive long-term development, primarily
as a result of greater globalisation through increased world trade,
urbanisation, digitisation and greater awareness of sustainability. In
addition to packaging materials, BillerudKorsnis sells surplus long-fib e
pulp, Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft (NBSK), which is not used
in its own production. BillerudKorsnis’ base is in Europe, but we are
continuing to become established in other markets, including in Asia.

During 2015 operations were divided into the three business areas:
Packaging Paper, Consumer Board and Containerboard. On 1 January
2016, the Containerboard business area changed its name to
Corrugated Solutions, which is the name used in this annual report.

Packaging Paper offers kraft and sack paper of p emium quality
plus smart solutions for customers with exacting demands in the
industrial, medical equipment and consumer sectors. The business
area also sells any surplus of pulp that BillerudKorsnis does not use
in its own production.

Consumer Board delivers packaging materials in high-quality
board made from primary fib e for beverages, food products and
various other consumer goods.

Corrugated Solutions supplies materials to corrugated board
manufacturers and packaging solutions to brand owners. Strong and
light materials, fluting and line , are used in corrugated boxes for fragile
goods and demanding distribution systems. Supply chain solutions
for packaging optimisation are a key component of the offering

Overall, order levels remained stable for all business areas during
the year. The e was seasonally lower demand in Packaging Paper
for white and brown sack paper in the fourth quarter. Corrugated
Solutions saw strong demand for fluting and stable demand for liner
during the year. Demand for Consumer Board’s products was
satisfactory during the year, with normal seasonal variations.

Prices in local currency were largely unchanged compared with
the previous year, with the exception of pulp prices, which fell in
2015. An improvement in the currency situation meant a significant
increase in prices in Swedish kronor. For further market information,
see the relevant business area section.

In 2015, BillerudKorsnas’ total sales volume amounted to 2 734
ktonnes, an increase of 1% compared with the previous year. The
increase is mainly attributable to higher sales volumes of paperboard
from the Consumer Board business area, while both Corrugated
Solutions and Packaging Paper had lower sales volumes compared
with the previous year. The dec ease in Packaging Paper was due to
lower sales volumes of brown sack paper at the end of the year.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Th decrease in Corrugated Solutions was mainly attributable to the
production problems at PM6 at Gruvén during the year.

Operating profit inc eased by SEK 270 million to SEK 971 million
compared with 2014. The inc ease was principally due to a more
favourable exchange rate and product mix. Sales volumes were at the
same level as the previous year. Higher sales volumes for market pulp
compensated for temporary lower sales volumes of sack paper at

the end of the year. Prices of packaging paper in local currency were
stable during the year, while prices in local currency for market pulp
decreased in the year.

Market Development

Order levels for both sack and kraft paper were normal for most of
2015. In the final qua ter of the year, however, orders decreased for
seasonal products such as sack paper.

The ma ket for NBSK pulp deteriorated steadily throughout the
year. Prices in Europe dropped to approximately USD 800 per tonne
at year-end, compared with approximately USD 930 per tonne at
the beginning of the year.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

previous year. Increased sales volumes were partly offset y higher
variable costs as a result of the stronger Swedish krona. The ebuilding
of the KMS paperboard machine in Frévi in the fourth quarter led to
production losses and higher maintenance costs in this business area,
which had a negative impact on the business area’s operating profit.

Market Development

Orders received for liquid and packaging board were stable and satis-
factory during the year with normal seasonal variations. The business
area experienced delivery pressure from its largest markets in the
second half of the year. Prices in local currency were in level with the
previous year.

Investments and capital employed

Gross investments in 2015 amounted to SEK 1 710 million (1 384).
In line with the Group’s ambitious growth plans, the following
major planned rebuilding work took place during the year: An
investment of around SEK 180 million in PM6 at Gruvén to increase
fluting quality and capacit . This in estment will enable production
capacity to be increased gradually over the next two years by 40 000
tonnes a year. An investment was made of approximately SEK 260
million in PM9 at Skarblacka to increase brown sack paper quality
and capacity. It will be possible to increase production capacity by
20 000 tonnes a year from 2016. Investments in the Frévi and Rock-
hammar production units of around SEK 430 million for increased
capacity of paperboard. The in estments made at these production
units will enable paperboard capacity to be increased from 450 000
tonnes a year in 2014 to 525 000 tonnes a year by 2018. In addition
to investments to improve capacity and quality, investments totalling
approximately SEK 450 million in environmental improvement
measures at the production unit in Gavle were made over the year.

In 2016, investments are expected to amount to approximately
SEK 1 300 million excluding the restructuring projects at Gruvén
and Skarblacka.

BillerudKorsnis’ capital employed at 31 December 2015 totalled
SEK 17 397 million (17 828). Return on capital employed, calculated
over the past 12-month period, amounted to 15% (11). Return on
equity was 16% (13).

Working capital in the fourth quarter totalled 10% (11) in relation
to net sales. During the year, extensive work was undertaken to
reduce the level of working capital to a long-term sustainable level of
10% in relation to net sales.

352 million, corresponding to 21.3%. The | w tax rate for 2015 was
mainly due to a non-taxable capital gain from the sale of SIA Latgran.

Environment and permit issues
BillerudKorsnis has six production units in Sweden, two in Finland and
one in the UK that require permits under environmental legislation.
These permits apply to the p oduction of pulp and paper. Billerud-
Korsnis has all officia permits necessary to conduct operations at the
volumes produced in 2015. The envi onmental impact of operations
is mainly in the form of emissions to air and water and the creation
of waste and noise.

BillerudKorsnis’ Swedish production units have been awarded
emission rights for carbon dioxide within the EU. The allocation for
the eight-year period that began in 2013 exceeds total projected

emissions.

Product and process development

The costs of p oduct and process development, to the extent
attributable to research activities, are charged to profit in the ear that
they arise. In the past year, such costs accounted for approximately
0.5% (0.3) of BillerudKorsnas’ operating costs.

Seasonal factors

BillerudKorsnas’ business is to a relatively limited extent subject to
seasonal fluctuations. eriodical maintenance shutdowns have the
largest impact, as each production unit halts production for around
one week. The loss of p oduction results in somewhat lower deliveries
over an extended period before, during and after the shutdown.
BillerudKorsnis’ costs are relatively stable throughout the year. Fixed
costs are slightly lower in the summer, due to fewer maintenance
projects and vacation. Energy costs are slightly higher in the winter
because of higher energy consumption and normally higher energy
prices, especially for electricity.

Maintenance shutdowns

In addition to ongoing maintenance during production, Billerud-
Korsnis’ production units normally also require more extensive
maintenance at some point during the year. In order to carry out
maintenance, production of pulp and paper is stopped in what

are known as maintenance shutdowns. The principal items of cost in
a maintenance shutdown are loss of volume arising from the shut-

MAINTENANCE SHUTDOWNS

down and fi ed costs, mainly costs of maintenance and overtime
work, as well as a certain portion of variable costs including higher
consumption of electricity and wood when production is restarted.
The effects of shut wns on earnings vary depending on the extent
of measures carried out, their nature and the actual length of the
shutdown. The estimated cost of shutd wn is an assessment of the
impact on earnings of a normal shutdown, compared with a quarter
during which no periodic maintenance shutdown takes place.

Other seasonal effects

A considerable share of volumes for BillerudKorsnis Flute® are used
for packaging for exporting fruit from the Mediterranean area. Demand
by this group of customers varies with the fruit export season and is
ordinarily highest in September—March.

A considerable share of BillerudKorsnis’ sack paper and Quick-
Fill® sack paper goes to packaging for cement and building materials.
The demand for building materials in urope is generally higher in
May—October.

BILLERUDKORSNAS

Parent company

From 2015, the parent company BillerudKorsnas AB includes the
sales organisation for the Nordic market and markets outside
Europe, and the head office function

On 31 December 2014, Gruvén’s assets and liabilities were sold
to the subsidiary BillerudKorsnas Sweden AB, resulting in a capital
loss of SEK -1 584 million. The capital loss was eliminated at roup
level and had no impact on consolidated profit/loss or the balance
sheet.

Operating income for 2015 was SEK -185 million, compared
with SEK -400 million for 2014, excluding operating profit for the
Gruvén production unit and excluding the above mentioned capital
loss. The inc ease was mainly due to amended policies on the
allocation of the parent company’s costs to subsidiaries and positive
effects of hedging contracts and_ evaluations of accounts receivable.

The pa ent company hedges both its own and the Group's net
currency fl ws. The pa ent company’s earnings include the results of
these hedging measures. This esult amounted to SEK -125 million
(-253) in 2015.

The pa ent company is responsible for the Group’s financing
issues and most of the Group’s external interest-bearing debt is raised
by the parent company.

For 2016, the parent company has hedged prices for around
one-third of the net surplus of NBSK pulp.

The a erage number of employees was 96 (91).

Cash and bank balances and short-term investments amounted
to SEK 10 million (499).

Risk management in parent company
For a description of the Group’s risk management, see the ’Risk
management and sensitivity analysis’ section. The description
applies, where appropriate, to both the Group and parent company.
Specific diff ences concerning the parent company are commented
on under this heading.

For an understanding of the risk exposure in the parent com-
pany, the following should be taken into account.

Customer credit

The pa ent company’s accounts receivable represent more than
80% of the Group’s accounts receivable, because a large share of the
production units accounts receivable are taken over by the parent
company after invoicing and the monies collected by the parent
company. However, the risk of any bad debt losses remains with the
invoicing company. Of total provision within the Group for doubt-
ful accounts receivable in 2015, SEK 0 million (0) was attributable
to the parent company.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Exchange rate exposure

All foreign exchange forward contracts for the Swedish operations
are hold by the parent company, while the exposure to payment

fl ws in foreign currency is borne by all the Swedish and Finnish
production units. Exposure for the parent company is thus lower than
that of the forward contracts signed. This applies up to the in oicing
date, because the parent company takes over the accounts receivable
for the Swedish and Finnish production units. At year-end 2015,
foreign exchange contracts not yet recognised in profit/loss for the
parent company nominally totalled SEK 2 672 million (3 124) and all
foreign exchange contracts will be recognised in profit/loss in 2016

Interest rate risk

The roup’s borrowing is conducted primarily via the parent com-
pany and accounted for 87% of the Group’s total borrowing at

31 December 2015. As a result, the parent company has largely the
same exposure to changes in interest rates as the Group. Interest rate
derivatives are used to change fi ed interest periods in the debt
portfolio. The majority of inte est rate derivatives are attributable to
the parent company.

Proposed allocation of profit

As shown on page 62 of this annual report, non-restricted equity in
the parent company, BillerudKorsnas AB, amounted to SEK 5 577
million at 31 December 2015.

According to BillerudKorsnis’ financial targets that apply until
year-end 2015, the dividend should equal 50% of net profit per
share over a business cycle and the net debt/equity ratio should be
less than 0.90. At the end of 2015, the Group’s net debt/equity ratio
was 0.40 (0.67). BillerudKorsnas’ Board of Directors proposes that,
of the earnings per share of SEK 8.75, SEK 4.25 per share be paid to
shareholders and that the remaining amount be carried forward.

Events after the close of the financial year
No events that materially affect the Compan ’s financial position
have occurred after the close of the financial ear.

Outlook
Demand and the order situation are expected to improve seasonally
in the first qua ter of 2016, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015.
Average prices in local currency are expected to remain generally
stable.
Investments are estimated to amount to around SEK 1 300 million
in 2016, excluding possible future restructuring projects at Gruvén

and Skarblacka.
