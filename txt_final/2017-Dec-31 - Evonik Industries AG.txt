Business model

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

1.1 Business model

Evonik is one of the world's leading specialty chemicals com-
panies. Our strengths include the balanced spectrum of our
business activities, end-markets, and regions. Around 80 per-
cent of sales come from market-leading positions', which
we are systematically expanding. Our strong competitive
Position is based on close collaboration with customers, high
innovative capability, and integrated technology platforms.

Our specialty chemicals products make an indispensable
contribution to the benefits of our customers’ products, which
generate their success in global competition. Close cooperation
with our customers enables us to build up a deep knowledge
of their business, so we can offer products tailored to their
specifications and extensive technical service. Our technology
centers and customer competence centers play an important
role in this around the world.

Market-oriented research and development is a key driver of
profitable growth. This is based on our strong innovation
culture, which is rooted in our innovation management and
management development. Good ideas are rapidly recognized,
driven forward, and implemented with our customers.

Highly trained employees are a key success factor. They
drive forward the company on a daily basis through their hard
work and identification. We have therefore developed a wide
range of activities to gain and develop talented and qualified
employees and to position Evonik as a preferred employer in
order to retain them.

As preconditions for Evonik’s future viability, sustainable
business activities and responsible conduct are cornerstones
of our business model. We drive forward our sustainability
activities along the value chain in close dialogue with our
stakeholders. As well as our own production processes and

the products we market, we always consider the supply chain
and the product benefits for our customers and their customers.
We drive forward transparency and sustainability along the
entire supply chain. We have observed rising demand from
our customers for products that demonstrate a good balance
of economic, ecological, and social factors. That opens up a
broad spectrum of future-oriented business opportunities for
Evonik in attractive markets. Sustainability has long been a
growth driver in many of our business.

A decentralized corporate structure

Our specialty chemicals operations are divided into three
chemical manufacturing segments, which operate close to
their markets and customers and have a high degree of entre-
preneurial independence.

The Nutrition & Care and Resource Efficiency segments
operate principally in attractive markets with above-average
growth rates. Both segments offer customers customized,
innovation-driven solutions and the aim is for them to achieve
above-average, profitable growth through innovations,
investments, and acquisitions.

The Performance Materials segment is characterized by
processes that make intensive use of energy and raw materi-
als. It therefore concentrates on integrated, cost-optimized
technology platforms, efficient workflows, and economies of
scale. Our strategic goal for this segment is to contribute
earnings to finance the growth of the Evonik Group. In the
future, investments and, where appropriate, alliances will
concentrate on securing and extending our good market
positions.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Broadly diversified end-markets

Most of our customers are industrial companies that use our
products for further processing. The range of markets in
which they operate is diverse and balanced. None of these
end-markets accounts for more than 20 percent of our sales.

Global production

Evonik has a presence in more than 100 countries and 82 per-
cent of sales are generated outside Germany. We have produc-
tion facilities in 28 countries on five continents and are therefore
close to our markets and our customers. Our largest production
sites—Marl, Wesseling and Rheinfelden (Germany), Antwerp
(Belgium), Mobile (Alabama, USA), Shanghai (China), and
Singapore—have integrated technology platforms used by
various units.

Integrated technology platforms are a

competitive advantage

Our products are manufactured using highly developed technol-
ogies that we are constantly refining. In many cases, Evonik
has integrated production complexes where it produces key
precursors for its operations in neighboring production facilities.
In this way we offer our customers maximum reliability of

ciples and objectives

Building a best-in-class specialty

chemicals company

We want to make Evonik the best-in-class specialty chemicals
company. This global aspiration is closely linked to our goal
of profitable growth. To increase the value of our company,
our strategy has three focal areas:

+ Amore balanced and more specialty portfolio

+ Customer-focused and sustainable innovation

+ An open and performance-oriented culture.

Our goal is to step up our focus on businesses with clear
specialty chemicals characteristics. To ensure an even better
balance within our portfolio and to grow where Evonik is
already strong but there are especially promising prospects,
our strategy concentrates on four growth engines:

+ Specialty Additives

+ Animal Nutrition

+ Smart Materials

+ Health & Care.

these growth engines.They each focus on different markets
but they have one thing in common: They are aligned consis-
tently to delivering innovative solutions for issues and devel-
opments of relevance to industry and end-customers in the
coming decades.

Innovation is an important driver of profitable growth at
Evonik. It leverages the development of new products and
applications. Within the four growth engines, Evonik has
defined six innovation fields': highly attractive new markets
where we can effectively deploy our core competencies.

This is supported by a corporate culture where every employee
takes responsibility for the company's success. Our corporate
culture is based on trust, respect, and openness. We regard
ourselves as an international company and see diversity as an
opportunity. We initiate change, keep our promises, reward
performance and readiness to take risks, and develop our own
executives. Together with an even stronger focus on success
and heightened cost-awareness, our corporate culture is a
key element in our strategy.

Principles and objectives
Business management systems

Our sustainability strategy takes up the growth engines
identified in our corporate strategy and defines areas of
action geared to balanced management of economic, ecological,
and social factors. We are keenly committed to expanding the
contribution made by our innovative solutions to sustainable
development.

Ambitious targets

We aim to increase the value of our company. In parallel with

the refocusing of our strategy, in 2017 we defined new financial

targets to support our goal of profitable growth.

+ We want to achieve volume growth that exceeds global
economic growth across the economic cycle.

+ The adjusted EBITDA margin should be raised sustain-
ably to a level of 18-20 percent. Historically it has been
16-18 percent.

1.3 Business management systems

Most important financial key performance indicators
Financial management of Evonik is based on a consistent
system of value-oriented indicators. These are used to assess
the business performance of the operational units and the
Group. Through systematic alignment to these indicators,
Evonik endeavors to create value by raising profitability and
ensuring profitable growth.

We use adjusted EBITDA (i.e., EBITDA after factoring
out special items) as a financial performance indicator. To
track the attainment of targets, the adjusted EBITDA of the
operating units is used. The adjusted EBITDA and the corre-
sponding relative indicator, the adjusted EBITDA margin, show
operating performance irrespective of the structure of assets
and investment profile. We use this in particular for internal
and external comparisons of the cost structure and profitability
of our businesses.

The return on capital employed (ROCE) is used as a further
indicator of value-driven management of the company. It is
calculated from adjusted EBIT in relation to average capital
employed. Comparison with the cost of capital, which shows
the risk-adjusted return expectations of our investors, indicates

1 See section on safety and environment.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Moreover, our previous financial targets remain valid:

+ An appropriate return on capital (ROCE) above the cost
of capital

+ Asustained positive cash flow

+ Asolid investment grade rating

+ An attractive dividend trend.

As a responsible specialty chemicals company, we are also
continuing to pursue our ambitious non-financial targets."

relative value creation. This is calculated using a weighted
average cost of capital, which reflects the return expectations
of both shareholders, derived from the capital asset pricing
model, and providers of debt capital.

The special items that are factored out when calculating
adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT include restructuring,
impairment losses/reversals of impairment losses, income
and expenses in connection with the purchase/disposal of
investments in companies, and other income and expense
items that, due to their nature or amount, do not reflect the
typical operating business. We consider that the adjusted
earnings figures are more suitable than unadjusted data for
comparing the performance of operating units over several
periods.

We also use free cash flow as an operational performance
indicator. This is calculated from the cash flow from operating
activities, continuing operations, less outflows for capital
expenditures on intangible assets, property, plant and equip-
ment. The free cash flow is the amount that can be used for
dividends, acquisitions, and to repay borrowing. It therefore
shows the company’s internal financing capacity.

Most important non-financial

key performance indicators

Evonik also uses a wide variety of non-financial performance
indicators. For example, our annual sustainability report
provides information on ecological and societal issues to
supplement our economic reporting.

Traditionally, we accord special significance to safety,
which is regarded as a holistic management task that has to
be lived at all management levels. Our guiding principles on
safety are binding for staff at all levels and were reinforced in
2015 by a global safety culture initiative. In accordance with
corporate policy, all units at Evonik have an occupational
safety target. In addition, all production units have a plant
safety target. The relevant indicators are accident frequency
and incident frequency.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

2.1 Overall assessment of the economic situation

As part of the ongoing development of our corporate strategy,
we have defined four strategic growth engines within our
Nutrition & Care and Resource Efficiency growth segments:
Specialty Additives, Animal Nutrition, Smart Materials, and
Health & Care. To improve the growth momentum of the
Evonik Group, we intend to focus our acquisitions and
research and development expenses on these growth engines,
which have particularly promising prospects in our view.

The acquisition of the specialty additives business of Air
Products and Chemicals Inc., Allentown (Pennsylvania, USA)
strengthens our leading position on the attractive growth
market for specialty additives. The acquisition of the silica
business of J. M. Huber Corporation, Atlanta (Georgia, USA)
strengths our activities in the Smart Materials growth engine.
Both of the businesses acquired have business models that
are similar to Evonik’s and are an ideal fit with our growth
engines.

Operationally, our business developed well. Thanks to high
global demand for our products, our growth segments
posted volume rises that exceeded global economic growth
(3.0 percent, expected). Selling prices developed differently
in the segments but increased overall. Thanks to 5 percent
organic sales growth and consolidation of the businesses
acquired, sales grew 13 percent overall to €14,419 million.
Adjusted EBITDA improved 9 percent to €2,360 million. The
Resource Efficiency segment was very successful, benefiting
from both higher volumes and the acquired businesses. Earnings
in the Performance Materials segment were significantly better
than in the previous year, mainly due to a favorable supply/
demand situation. By contrast, the Nutrition & Care segment
was held back by perceptibly lower selling prices.

2.2 Economic background

Positive global economic development

Global economic conditions developed better than expected in
2017. We estimate that the global economy grew by around
3.0 percent in 2017, which was faster than in the previous year
(2.3 percent). At the start of the year, growth of 2.6 percent
had been forecast.

The adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.4 percent fell short of both
the prior-year level (17.0 percent) and the target mid-term
range of 18-20 percent. ROCE was 11.2 percent, which was
above the cost of capital, but it remained below the prior-
year level (14.0 percent) as capital employed was significantly
higher due to the acquisitions.

Net income fell 15 percent to €717 million. The reasons
for this included higher expenses in connection with the
acquisitions. Net income after adjustment for special items
increased by 9 percent to €1,010 million, in line with the
development of operating income. At the Annual Shareholders’
Meeting, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board will
again propose a dividend of €1.15 per share.

Our financial profile is still very good: Evonik has a solid
investment grade rating. The cash flow from operating activities
was good at €1,551 million. After deduction of outflows for
capital expenditures, the free cash flow was clearly positive at
€511 million. At year-end 2017 we had net financial debt as a
result of the acquisitions.

2016 2,165
2017 2,360

0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000

Taking a regional view shows that the global upswing was
broadly based. The economy picked up in the emerging markets
as well as the industrialized nations.

The moderate upswing in Western Europe continued,
with economies benefiting from the continuation of the
European Central Bank's expansionary monetary policy and
a moderate rise in prices. In Germany, the economy was
mainly driven by consumer spending, the trade surplus, and
the good labor market situation.

Eastern Europe posted considerable growth overall, primarily
as a result of the recent favorable development of the Russian
market. The main reasons for this were the clear stabilization
of the ruble and the associated reduction in inflation.

The strong growth in North America resulted principally
from a rise in domestic consumption and investment by the
corporate sector. In view of the good economic situation, the
Federal Reserve continued its gradual tightening of monetary
policy and raised key interest rates by a total of 0.75 percentage
points in three steps to 1.5 percent.

A recovery is visible in Central and South America,
although so far growth has been relatively low. Political uncer-
tainty, high levels of unemployment and private debt, and
structural problems prevented a significant improvement in
the economic situation.

2.3 Major events

On January 3, 2017, we closed the acquisition of the Air
Products specialty additives business, integrated it into the
Nutrition & Care and Resource Efficiency segments, and
linked it to our established businesses. The acquisition of the
Huber silica business was completed on September 1, 2017
and integrated into the Resource Efficiency segment.' The
integration of both businesses is proceeding on schedule. In
2017, we leveraged the first synergies of around €20 million,
most of which came from the integration of the specialty
additives business.

1 See Note 4.2 to the consolidated financial statements.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

The Asia-Pacific region again posted high growth rates. The
moderate recovery in Japan continued as a result of higher
exports, while the Chinese economy stabilized, mainly thanks
to an expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. Economic
momentum in India was dampened by a cash reform and the
introduction of a uniform nationwide value-added tax.

Stronger development of end-customer industries
Worldwide, the development of Evonik’s end-customer
industries differed by region and by sector in 2017. We antici-
pate that overall industrial growth was higher than in the
previous year.

Demand for consumer and care products rose in Europe,
driven by an improvement in consumer sentiment and falling
unemployment, and remained high in Asia-Pacific. Growth
momentum for food and animal feed increased in North
America but weakened slightly in Central and South America.
The construction industry reported slightly higher growth
than in the previous year, mainly thanks to higher capital
expenditures in Europe. By contrast, automotive and mechanical
engineering output was lower in Asia-Pacific due to a reduc-
tion in tax benefits and declined in North America.

Overall, there was an improvement in the general indus-
trial trend in almost all regions of the world.

As a result of the increase in the price of crude oil and
tougher environmental regulations in China at the end of the
year, there was a year-on-year increase in Evonik’s average
raw material prices in 2017.

The average annual exchange rate for the euro against
Evonik’s most important currency—the US dollar—was
USS$1.13 and thus slightly higher than in the previous year
(US$1.10).

At its meeting on March 1, 2017, the Supervisory Board of
Evonik Industries AG resolved on changes in the Executive
Board. Dr. Klaus Engel handed over his post as Chairman of
the Executive Board of Evonik Industries AG to Christian
Kullmann after the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May
23, 2017 and left the company with effect from the end of the
meeting. Dr. Ralph Sven Kaufmann left Evonik by mutual and
amicable agreement on June 30, 2017, before the scheduled
end of his term of office. Dr. Harald Schwager has been Deputy
Chairman of the Executive Board, with responsibility for chem-
icals and innovation, since September 1, 2017. Dr. Schwager is
a chemist and was a member of the Board of Executive Direc
tors of BASF SE, Ludwigshafen (Germany) until May 2017.

Pleasing volume trend

We registered high demand for our products worldwide,
especially in our growth segments, and were able to raise
volumes sold considerably. Selling prices developed differ-
ently in the segments, but improved overall. 8 percent of the
increase in our sales came from the initial consolidation of the
businesses acquired from Air Products and Huber. Overall,
Group sales grew 13 percent to €14,419 million.

The decline in adjusted EBITDA in the Nutrition & Care seg-
ment mainly resulted from perceptibly lower selling prices.
The Resource Efficiency segment registered a further
improvement in its adjusted EBITDA thanks to higher volumes
and consolidation of the acquired businesses. The substantial
rise in earnings in the Performance Materials segment was
driven mainly by higher selling prices and by the successful
implementation of restructuring and efficiency enhancement
measures. Adjusted EBITDA in the Services segment was
lower owing to higher costs at the sites. The adjusted EBITDA
reported by Corporate, other operations, including consoli-

dation, was around the prior-year level, and includes, among
others, expenses for the Corporate Center and strategic
research.

29 percent was below the expected Group tax rate of 32 per-

the reduction in the corporation tax rate following the US tax
reform. The income tax rate after factoring out taxes on spe-

FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Improvement in the cost position initiated

To support our financial targets, especially an improvement in
the adjusted EBITDA margin, in November 2017 we announced
plans to achieve a lasting reduction in selling and administrative
expenses of €200 million by 2021. We have already identified
savings potential of €50 million to be implemented in the
course of 2018. Further details of the planned measures will
be announced in 2018.

Efficient and effective procurement

Reliable supply, gaining access to new procurement markets,
and ongoing optimization of material costs are key tasks for
our procurement function.

2017 was dominated by very volatile procurement markets
and rising oil prices. The reasons for this included geopolitical
tension in the Middle East, hurricanes such as Harvey in the
USA, and the Chinese government's tougher stance on environ-
mental policy. This led to unforeseeable production stoppages
in the supply chain and global price rises in some procurement
markets. We essentially managed to secure supply to our sites
through close cooperation with the suppliers affected and by
drawing on alternative suppliers. Since we take environmental
and sustainability aspects into account when selecting suppliers,
none of our direct suppliers was affected by plant closures
caused by Chinese environmental policy.

To optimize material costs, Procurement pursues a total-cost-
of-ownership (TOC) approach, taking cross-unit aspects into
account. This enables us to leverage savings potential along
the value chain. Close collaboration with the business entities
is a key success factor for efficient and effective procurement
processes.

We continued to optimize our procurement processes in
2017. In particular, we made substantial progress in optimiz-
ing the end-to-end process from order to payment and
achieved a considerable increase in the automation rate.

As well as participating in procurement alliances with other
companies and validating new suppliers, we are working
intensively to extend strategic relationships with suppliers.
Here we are looking for additional opportunities to reduce
tisk, optimize costs, and enhance cooperation and innovation
with the suppliers that are currently of the greatest strategic
importance. We are aware of our responsibility within the
supply chain. Issues such as safety, health, environmental
protection, corporate responsibility, and quality play an inte-
gral part in our procurement strategy. These sustainability

aspects are also supported by standardized global assess-
ments through the Together for Sustainability (TfS) sector
initiative, which was co-founded by Evonik. Evonik’s principal
suppliers and the majority of suppliers of critical raw materials
have already taken part in these assessments, which are eval-
uated by an impartial sustainability rating company.

In 2017, Evonik spent around €9.1 billion on raw materials
and supplies, technical goods, services, energy, and other
operating supplies. Raw materials and supplies make up
around 60 percent of procurement volume. Spending on petro-
chemical feedstocks is around €3.6 billion and accounts for
66 percent of our raw material base.

Using renewable resources remains very important to
Evonik. In 2017, around 9 percent of raw materials were from
renewable resources. The main applications for these raw mate-
rials are amino acids and starting products for the cosmetics
industry.

Another good return on capital employed

Within our value-oriented management approach, our suc-
cess is measured principally by ROCE, which was 11.2 percent
in 2017 and therefore above our cost of capital. In our regular
review in 2017, the cost of capital was adjusted to 10.0 per-
cent before taxes (2016: 10.5 percent).

Business conditions and performance
Comparison of forecast and actual performance

The average capital employed increased by €3.0 billion to
€13.3 billion. The acquisitions made a key contribution to this
as they led to substantial increases, especially in intangible
assets, property, plant and equipment, and inventories.

The higher capital employed was the reason for the
decline in ROCE at Group level and in the growth segments.
The hidden reserves identified in connection with the acqui-
sitions contributed to this.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

In the three chemical segments, ROCE is above the cost of
capital. In the Resource Efficiency and Performance Materials
ROCE was well above average.

Clear value creation

Economic Value Added (EVA®) is the difference between
adjusted EBIT and the cost of capital, which is calculated by
multiplying average capital employed by the average cost of
capital (WACC). If EVA® is positive, the Group creates value
(value spread approach). In 2017, we generated EVA® of
€163 million. The substantial reduction of €252 million com-
pared with the previous year was attributable to the rise in
capital employed.

Acquisitions lifted sales

In the Nutrition & Care segment, sales advanced 5 percent to
€4,511 million. This was principally due to the first-time con-
solidation of the business acquired from Air Products and of
Dr. Straetmans. High global demand led to a perceptible rise
in volumes. However, this was countered by the fact that sell-
ing prices were substantially lower than in the prior-year
period.

In essential amino acids for animal nutrition, selling prices
for methionine were lower than in the previous year. Evonik
used the more favorable market environment in the second
half of the year to raise selling prices. However, sales declined
significantly because the average market price level was sig-
nificantly lower than in the previous year and volumes were
basically constant. In the healthcare business, a very successful
performance was posted by functional polymers for smart
drug delivery systems for oral and parenteral pharmaceutical

applications and by exclusive synthesis for the pharmaceutical
industry. Personal care products increased sales of active
ingredients and emulsifiers. The integration of Dr. Straetmans
is proving very successful and also contributed to the sales
growth in this business line. Sales of household care products
increased significantly thanks to buoyant demand and the
inclusion of the Air Products activities. Higher volumes and
inclusion of the Air Products activities also brought a significant
increase in sales of additives for polyurethane foam, which
are used, for example, in mattresses and in insulating materials.

Adjusted EBITDA lower than in the prior year
Adjusted EBITDA in the Nutrition & Care segment declined
26 percent to €749 million. This decline was due principally
to lower selling prices. The adjusted EBITDA margin slipped
from a very good level of 23.3 percent in the previous year to
16.6 percent.

Segment performance

Higher capital expenditures

Capital expenditures in the Nutrition & Care segment increased
24 percent to €391 million and were again well above depre-
ciation and amortization, which was €262 million. The average
capital employed increased significantly to €4,263 million,
mainly as a result of the acquisition of the Air Products business
and Dr. Straetmans. The sharp drop in ROCE to 10.9 percent
resulted from far higher capital employed and lower earnings.

Investment projects to drive growth

Nutrition & Care invested a high double-digit million euro
amount in the construction of a new production plant for
specialty silicones in Shanghai (China). Organically modified
specialty silicones are part of the Specialty Additives growth
engine and offer a broad spectrum of potential applications in
many industries. As polymer additives, they ensure comfortable
upholstered furniture, auto seats, and ergonomic mattresses.
They also play an important part in formulations for insulating

materials for buildings and ensure the energy efficiency of
refrigerators. The silicone platforms are the backbone of
significant business activities in the Nutrition & Care and
Resource Efficiency segments.

At the site in Tippecanoe (USA), Nutrition & Care invested
a double-digit million euro amount to extend its production
facilities for highly potent active ingredients. The market for
contract development and manufacturing of pharmaceutical
products is still very attractive and supports the positive devel-
opment of the healthcare business.

In view of the strong growth in the market for methionine,
Nutrition & Care is currently building a further world-scale
production complex in Singapore, alongside the facility on
Jurong Island that came into service in November 2014. This
investment strengthens the Animal Nutrition growth engine.
In this new, fully backwardly integrated production complex,
as well, the Nutrition & Care segment will produce all key
strategic precursors.

Perceptible volume growth

The Resource Efficiency segment posted a successful perfor-
mance, with sales growing 21 percent to €5,395 million.
There was a further substantial hike in volume sales, driven by
higher demand. Slightly higher selling prices also had a positive
effect. 13 percentage points of the increase came from con-
solidation of the operations acquired from Air Products and
Huber.

Silica benefited from higher demand, especially from the tire
industry, and from consolidation of the Huber business, lead-
ing to significantly higher sales. Crosslinkers developed well
worldwide. These products are mainly used in environment-

friendly paint systems/coatings, high-performance composites,
and specialty plastics. Including consolidation of the Air Prod-
ucts business, sales were significantly higher. Coating addi-
tives, which mainly offer applications solutions for coating
technologies, increased sales substantially thanks to higher
volumes and consolidation of the Air Products business. The
business with high-performance polymers was pleasing, with
high demand from the automotive sector, the electrical and
electronics industry, and the consumer market bringing an
increase in sales. Demand for oil additives for the automotive,
construction, and transportation industries was high world-
wide, resulting in a considerable year-on-year rise in sales.

High investment—Attractive return on capital

Capital expenditures rose 28 percent in the Resource Efficiency
segment to €340 million and thus once again exceeded
depreciation and amortization. The average capital employed
increased 54 percent to €4,262 million, principally as a result
of the acquisition of the Air Products and Huber activities. As
a consequence, ROCE decreased to 20.8 percent, but that
was nevertheless a good level.

Investment projects to expand market positions

We have started up a further production complex for the
SEPURAN® brand of gas separation modules in Schérfling
(Austria). This investment in the mid-double-digit million euro
range doubles production capacity. SEPURAN® membranes
allow particularly efficient separation of gases such as methane,
nitrogen, and hydrogen.

A production plant for polyamide 12 powder in Marl
(Germany) was also completed. Investment here was in the
mid-double-digit million euro range. The Resource Efficiency
segment will use the additional production capacity to meet
rising demand from attractive markets in the coatings industry
and additive manufacturing.

By raising global capacity for precipitated silica, the
Resource Efficiency segment is supporting the growth of its
global customers in the tire and construction industries and in
attractive specialty markets. In North America, a new pro-
duction facility for precipitated silica is currently under con-
struction in Charleston (South Carolina, USA), close to
almost all major customers in the tire industry. This involves
investment in the low triple-digit million euro range. Precip-
itated silica is a fast-growing product that is mainly used in
high-quality tires with low rolling resistance. Other areas of
application are the food, feed, and agriculture industries. In
North America, the market for tires with low rolling resis-
tance, and thus for HD silica, is growing far faster than the
market for normal auto tires.

In Antwerp (Belgium), the Resource Efficiency segment
is investing a sum in the high double-digit million euro range
to extend capacity for fumed silica. This production complex
is scheduled to come into service in summer 2019. Typical
applications for this special silica, which Evonik markets as
AEROSIL®, are paints, coatings, modern adhesive systems,
transparent silicones, and non-combustible high-performance
insulating materials. Precipitated and fumed silicas belong to
the Smart Materials growth engine.

As binders for paints, specialty copolyesters are used in coil
coatings and, increasingly, in food can coatings. To meet rising
demand, the segment is investing in a new plant at the Witten
site in Germany. This will have annual capacity of several
thousand metric tons. Completion is scheduled for 2018.

Considerably higher sales

Sales rose 17 percent to €3,781 million in the Performance
Materials segment. The primarily price-driven rise in sales
was mainly attributable to a boom in Cy business, concentration
on attractive market segments, and new areas of application.
The slightly lower volumes were mainly attributable to an
unplanned shutdown in Antwerp (Belgium) in the second
quarter of 2017.

Sales of performance intermediates rose substantially
year-on-year, mainly because the average selling prices for
the year were higher, especially for the C4 derivative butadiene.
Methacrylates also registered a significant improvement in
sales. Demand remained pleasing, especially from the coatings
and automotive sectors, while supply on the market was
tight. Alkoxides for the production of biodiesel posted a very
good performance, with higher volumes leading to a percep-
tible rise in sales.

Investment in the Performance Materials segment aims to
secure its leading market positions, raise efficiency, and
broaden the technology base. Capital expenditures amounted
to €163 million, above depreciation and amortization, which
was €139 million. The average capital employed was reduced
by €45 million to €1,233 million. ROCE rose to an attractive
level of 41.2 percent, principally as a result of the significant
improvement in earnings.

Focused investment
To ensure sustainable and reliable long-term supply of potas-
sium derivatives to customers, Evonik established a production
joint venture with AkzoNobel to build and operate a membrane
electrolysis plant for chlorine and potassium hydroxide solution
in Ibbenbiiren (Germany). Production started at the end of 2017.
In Weiterstadt (Germany), Performance Materials is
building a new production facility for high-quality flat films
made from multi-layer polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA).
This is scheduled to come into service at the end of 2018.
Multi-layer PLEXIGLAS® and EUROPLEX? films are used in
medical technology, in window and facade construction, and
in the graphics industry.

2.7 Regional development

Strategic reorganization of the regions

Evonik adjusted its regional structure in 2017. Global market
requirements are becoming increasingly more specific and
require more differentiated management.

For this reason, we adjusted the regional structure to align
it more closely to these new requirements. At the same time,
the entrepreneurial freedom of the regions was strengthened.
Their role is to enable the operating business to make the
best possible use of local market opportunities by providing
efficient, competitive, and compliant platforms.

The objective of this altered structure is to ensure a more
focused response to future challenges and timely identification
and utilization of growth opportunities throughout the world.

A global presence
In 2017, 43 percent of our sales were generated in Western
Europe. That was a year-on-year increase of 13 percent to

lower than in the previous year at €123 million. The decline
was due, among other things, to higher expenses at the sites.
Capital expenditures in this segment decreased by 14 per-
cent to €162 million and therefore exceeded depreciation and
amortization, which amounted to €124 million.

€6,253 million. The acquisition of the Air Products specialty
additives business and the Huber silica business contributed
to this.

To strengthen the sites in Western Europe, we increased
capital expenditures to €576 million (2016: €538 million). A
production facility for polyamide 12 powder was completed at
our site in Marl (Germany). In Ibbenbiiren (Germany), a pro-
duction joint venture established with AkzoNobel started up a
membrane electrolysis plant for chlorine and potassium
hydroxide solution. Another complex for the production of gas
separation membrane modules was constructed in Austria.

In Eastern Europe, sales increased 9 percent to €837 million.
In particular, the Resource Efficiency and Performance Materials
segments were able to increase sales. This region accounted for
6 percent of Group sales.

In the Middle East and Africa region, sales rose 4 percent to
€421 million, which was 3 percent of Group sales.

Income before income taxes, continuing

operations down slightly year-on-year

Sales grew 13 percent to €14.4 billion, principally as a result
of higher volumes and initial consolidation of the businesses
acquired from Air Products and Huber. The rise in the cost of
sales was driven mainly by consolidation of the new busi-
nesses, higher volumes, and the increase in raw material
costs. The higher selling expenses were mainly due to the
expansion of our business, while administrative expenses
increased as a result of consolidation of the acquired busi-
nesses. Other operating income includes income in connection

Sales increased 11 percent to €2,158 million in Asia-Pacific
North. This region accounted for 15 percent of Group sales.
Capital expenditures in this region totaled €61 million. A new

other operating expense was mainly attributable to the acqui-
sitions. It included expenses resulting from the fact that the
value of inventories acquired by Evonik with these businesses
and used in 2017 was subject to step-ups in the course of the
purchase price allocation (€102 million), as well as costs in
connection with the acquisitions (€62 million). Income
before financial result and income taxes was 5 percent lower
at €1,229 million, principally because of higher expenses in
connection with the acquisitions.

Central financial management

The principal objectives of financial management are safe-
guarding the financial independence of the Evonik Group and
limiting financial risks. We therefore apply a central financing
strategy. Borrowing and bond issuance are normally under-
taken by Evonik Industries AG or its financing company Evonik
Finance B.V., Amsterdam (Netherlands). The liabilities of this
company are fully guaranteed by Evonik Industries AG. To
reduce external borrowing, surplus liquidity at Group compa-
nies is placed in a cash pool at Group level to cover financing
requirements in other Group companies through intragroup
loans. Currency derivatives are used at Group level to hedge
intragroup loans. Evonik has a flexible range of corporate

after-tax income comprised the pro rata profits and losses of
fully consolidated subsidiaries that are attributable to share-
holders outside the Evonik Group. The income after taxes,

prised the partial reversal of a provision relating to the former

financing instruments to meet liquidity requirements for day-to-
day business, investments, and the repayment of financial debt.

Solid investment grade rating confirmed

Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's (S&P) confirmed their
credit ratings for Evonik Industries AG in 2017. Moody's rating
is still Baal and S&P still rates Evonik BBB+, with a stable out-
look in both cases. Maintaining a solid investment grade rating
is a central element in our financing strategy. In this way we
gain access to a broad investor base on appropriate financing
terms and thus maintain our financial flexibility. A solid invest-
ment grade rating gives banks, investors, customers, and sup-
pliers a reliable basis for a long-term business relationship
with Evonik.

Financial condition

Solid funding of pension obligations

Pension provisions account for about half of our total debt.
They are non-current and depend on the discount rate.
Applying a constant discount rate, there was a slight reduc
tion of €35 million in pension provisions compared with year-
end 2016. The financing of pension obligations! was 70 per-
cent as of the reporting date, a solid level in line with the
industry norm.

Net financial debt due to acquisitions

As of December 31, 2017, financial debt was €4,045 million, a
rise of €498 million compared with year-end 2016, principally
as the result of the issue of a hybrid bond. Financial assets
decreased by €3,636 million to €1,022 million, mainly as a
result of payment of the purchase price of around €3.5 billion
for the Air Products specialty additives business and payment
of the dividend of €536 million for 2016. This was countered
by the positive free cash flow? of €511 million. Net financial

First hybrid bond issued

On July 7, 2017, Evonik Industries AG issued a hybrid bond
with a nominal value of €500 million on the debt capital mar-
ket for the first time. It was used to finance the acquisition of
the Huber silica business. The hybrid bond is recognized as
debt, but the Moody’s and S&P rating agencies regard it as

7 Ratio of plan assets to pension obligations.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

50 percent equity as it is subordinate to other financial liabil-
ities. Consequently, it supports our solid investment grade
rating. The formal tenor of the bond is 60 years, but Evonik
has a first redemption right in 2022. The issue price was
99.383 percent and it has a coupon of 2.125 percent p.a.

Corporate bonds as a central financing instrument
At year-end 2017, the financial debt of €4,045 million com-
prised six bonds with a total carrying amount of €3,624 mil-
lion, decentralized bank loans totaling €350 million, and
other financial liabilities of €71 million. On the reporting date,
3.15 billion of the debt issuance program of up to €5 billion
had been used to issue bonds.

Around 94 percent of the Group's non-derivative financial
liabilities are denominated in euros (2016: over 90 percent).
Financial liabilities in other currencies result exclusively from
local financing of foreign Group companies, especially in China.
The use of currency derivatives aims to ensure that Evonik’s
global operating activities are financed in the corresponding
currencies. Including these currency derivatives, around
41 percent of financial liabilities are denominated in euros,
34 percent in US dollars, 16 percent in Chinese renminbi yuan
(CNY), 6 percent in Singapore dollars (SGD), and 3 percent
in other currencies.

Liquidity position remains strong

As of December 31, 2017, Evonik had cash and cash equiva-
lents amounting to €1,004 million. Alongside cash and cash
equivalents and investments in current securities, Evonik’s
central source of liquidity is a €1.75 billion revolving credit
facility. On June 20, 2017, we refinanced this credit line at the
same amount with 18 national and international banks. The
ial term running until 2022 with
two extension options of one year each, so it runs until June
2024 at the latest. It was not utilized in 2017 and does not
contain any covenants requiring Evonik to meet specific
financial ratios.

In addition, there are various credit lines to meet local
requirements, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. As of
December 31, 2017, €306 million of the total amount had not

Higher capital expenditures

In the specialty chemicals sector Evonik is expanding in busi-
ness areas and markets where it already has—or intends to
build—a strong competitive position. Investment projects are

Major projects completed or virtually completed in 2017

aimed at utilizing potential for sustained profitable growth
and value creation. Every project undergoes detailed strategic
and economic analyses. In addition, there is a minimum return
requirement for every project based on Evonik’s cost of
capital. We take a flexible and disciplined approach to
extending our leading market positions. All projects are reg-
ularly reviewed for changes in the market situation.

We increased capital expenditures by 12 percent to
€1,078 million in 2017. In principle, there is a slight timing
difference in outflows for property, plant and equipment due
to payment terms. In 2017, cash outflows for property, plant
and equipment totaled €1,040 million (2016: €948 million).

The highest proportion of capital expenditures went to the
Nutrition & Care and Resource Efficiency segments (36 percent
and 32 percent respectively). A further 15 percent each was
allocated to the Performance Materials segment and the Ser-
vices segment. The regional focus of capital expenditures was
Western Europe, which accounted for 53 percent of the total,
followed by North America (24 percent), Asia-Pacific South
(16 percent), and Asia-Pacific North (6 percent).

Business review
Financial condition

Financial investments amounted to €4,322 million in 2017
(2016: €191 million). They mainly comprised the acquisition
of the Air Products specialty additives business and the
Huber silica business."

Free cash flow of €511 million

The cash flow from operating activities declined by €218 mil-
lion year-on-year to €1,551 million. This was mainly due to a
smaller reduction in net working capital.

In 2017, we generated a free cash flow of €511 million
(2016: €821 million). In addition to the lower cash flow from
operating activities, the higher cash outflows for capital
expenditures contributed to the year-on-year decline.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

The cash flow from financing activities was €23 million,
mainly as a result of the cash inflow from the new bond. This
was mainly reduced by the cash outflow for payment of the
dividend for 2016. In the previous year, the cash inflow from
financing activities was €1,373 million, principally as a result
of the issuance of bonds.

Slight increase in total assets

As of December 31, 2017, total assets were €0.3 billion
higher at €19.9 billion. Non-current assets increased by
€37 billion to €14.5 billion, mainly as a consequence of the
high earnings. This was primarily because intangible assets
increased by €2.8 billion to €6.1 billion and property, plant
and equipment increased by €0.5 billion to €6.5 billion. In all,
non-current assets increased to 73 percent of total assets, up
from 55 percent in the prior year. They are financed by liabil-
ities with the same maturity structure.

Balance sheet structure of the Evonik Group

Current assets declined by €3.4 billion to €5.4 billion. The
decline resulted principally from cash and cash equivalents,
which fell by €3.6 billion to €1.0 billion due to the purchase
price payment for the Air Products specialty additives business.
This was countered by an increase in inventories of €0.3 billion
to €2.0 billion and rise of €0.1 billion in trade accounts
receivable to €1.8 billion. Current assets therefore decreased
to 27 percent of total assets (2016: 45 percent).

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

3. Performance of Evonik Industries AG

Evonik Industries AG, Essen (Germany) is the parent company
of the Evonik Group. It holds direct and indirect stakes in all
subsidiaries in the Group. The annual financial statements for
Evonik Industries AG have been prepared in accordance with
the accounting standards set out in the German Commercial
Code (HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

The earnings performance of Evonik Industries AG is essen-
tially dependent on income from its subsidiaries, income and
expenses relating to corporate financing, and portfolio
management activities. Financial management is therefore
based on an earnings indicator that contains all these effects:
net income.

Net income 375 1,238
Profit carried forward from the previous year 400 -
Allocation to revenue reserves -5 -302
Net profit 770 936

The 5 percent rise in sales to €667 million was principally
attributable to an increase in procurement activities, espe-
cially for raw materials. As a result, the cost of materials was
Tl percent higher at €246 million. Personnel expense was
€366 million, an increase of €25 million compared with the
prior year. Other operating income increased to €971 million.
The increase resulted mainly from currency translation gains. In
the gross presentation, currency translation gains of €910 mil-
lion (2016: €670 million) are shown in other operating income,
while the corresponding currency translation losses of €914 mil-
lion (2016: €675 million) are shown separately in other oper-
ating expense. The net effect was a loss of €4 million (2016:
€5 million). This was countered by the reduction in income
from the reversal of provisions from €147 million to €6 mil-
lion.

Income from investments fell 44 percent to €834 million. This
decline was mainly due to lower income from profit-and-loss
transfer agreements. The write-downs of financial assets and
current securities totaling €49 million and write-ups of finan-
cial assets and current securities totaling €149 million mainly
related to affiliated companies.

The net interest position declined from net interest income
of €18 million to net interest expense of €43 million. This
was mainly caused by higher interest expense in connection
with the valuation of pension obligations. This item also con-
tains interest income and expense from the Group-wide cash
pool, which is concentrated at Evonik Industries AG.

Income before income taxes declined by 59 percent to
€541 million, principally as a result of lower income from
profit-and-loss transfer agreements. Income taxes amounted
to €166 million, compared with €85 million in 2016.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

As forecast, net income declined substantially and was
375 million, a drop of €863 million compared with the previous
year. Following allocation of €4,537,505.50 to revenue reserves
and taking into account the profit of €400,000,000.00 car-
ried forward from the previous year, the net profit was

€770,000,000.00. A proposal will be put to the Annual
Shareholders’ Meeting that €535,900,000.00 of the net
profit should be paid out, giving a dividend of €1.15 per
share. A further €234,100,000.00 should be carried forward
to fiscal 2018.

assets mainly comprise shares in subsidiaries. The receivables
mainly comprise financial receivables of €3.0 billion (2016:
€2.2 billion), principally in connection with loans and cash
pooling activities. The drop of €4.3 billion in cash and cash
equivalents to €0.6 billion related to payment of the purchase
price of €3.5 billion for the acquisition of the Air Products
specialty additives business.

Equity decreased by €0.1 billion to €6.6 billion, mainly as
a consequence of lower earnings. The equity ratio rose from
42.1 percent in 2016 to 48.7 percent. Provisions increased from
€577 million to €610 million, mainly as a consequence of
interest effects on provisions for pensions and higher provisions
for taxes. The receivables and liabilities reflect the financing

activities of Evonik Industries AG in its role as the holding
company for the Group. Payables include financial liabilities of
€6.1 billion (2016: €8.4 billion). €4.2 billion (2016: €7.1 billion)
of this amount comprises liabilities to affiliated companies,
principally in connection with cash pooling activities. A further
€1.8 billion (2016: €1.3 billion) relates to corporate bonds.

Opportunities and risks

The most significant operating subsidiaries in Germany have
profit-and-loss transfer agreements with Evonik Industries
AG. In line with the central financing strategy of the Evonik
Group, most internal and external financing transactions are
handled by Evonik Industries AG. Consequently, Evonik
Industries AG is essentially exposed to the same risks and
opportunities as the Evonik Group. Further information can
be found in the opportunity and risk report.

Performance of Evonik Industries AG

Outlook" for 2018

We anticipate that in 2018 the net income of Evonik Industries
AG will be slightly higher than in 2017. This is based on the
assumption of attractive income from investments. By contrast,
given the low interest rates, effects relating to pension provi-
sions could have a negative impact.

Report on relations with affiliated companies

A report on Evonik Industries AG's relations with affiliated
companies has been prepared in accordance with Section 312 of
the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). It concludes with
the following declaration: “Our company received adequate
remuneration or compensation for each of the transactions
set out in this report on relations with affiliated companies
under the circumstances known to us at the time when the
transactions were undertaken. No actions were performed or
omitted at the instigation of such companies.”

Innovation strategy firmly anchored

in corporate strategy

Innovations and a systematic alignment to specialty chemicals
play a key role in our drive to be the best-in-class specialty
chemicals company.

In view of this, we have taken an important step to pave
the way for the future: In 2016, we restructured our innovation
portfolio to focus on six growth fields, which are assigned to
our growth engines in highly attractive markets with
above-average growth rates. Evonik’s core competencies are
ideally positioned to supply new products and solutions in
the six innovation growth fields:

+ Sustainable Nutrition: Establishing additional products
and services for sustainable nutrition of livestock and people

+ Healthcare Solutions: Developing new materials for
implants, as components of cell culture media, and for
custom-tailored drug formulations

+ Advanced Food Ingredients: Creating a portfolio of
health-enhancing substances and nutritional supplements
as a contribution to healthy nutrition

+ Membranes: Extending SEPURAN® technology for effi-
cient gas separation to further applications

+ Cosmetic Solutions: Developing further products based
on natural sources for cosmetics and sensorially optimized
formulations for skin care products

+ Additive Manufacturing: Developing products and tech-
nologies for additive manufacturing

In the Sustainable Nutrition growth field, for example, we are
establishing further products and services for sustainable
nutrition of livestock. That involves linking modern digital tech-
nologies with our knowledge and experience of healthy animal
nutrition. That benefits the animals, farmers, and consumers.

Another of our innovation growth fields is working on
membranes. Our SEPURAN® technology for efficient gas
separation is continuously being optimized for additional
applications, giving us access to attractive markets. In 2017,
we started up an extended production complex at our site in
Schérfling (Austria). Here we will be producing membrane
modules, especially for efficient nitrogen separation. A further
membrane for the treatment of natural gas should be added

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

to this product portfolio this year. Natural gas and nitrogen
together account for over 80 percent of the total gas separation
market.

The innovation portfolio in our growth segments and at
our strategic innovation unit Creavis is aligned to these
growth fields.

Successful innovations
Evonik has an extensive patent strategy to protect new prod-
ucts and processes. The quality of our patent portfolio has
increased steadily in recent years. Some 230 new patent appli-
cations were filed in the reporting period. Overall, we had
around 26,000 patents and pending patents in 2017. Our
“patent-driven” sales indicator was 52 percent of consolidated
sales.! Product sales are defined as “patent-driven” if there is
at least one relevant patent in force worldwide.

In 2017, products and applications introduced in the past
five years accounted for 10 percent of Evonik’s consolidated
sales.

Our innovation pipeline is well stocked. It comprises a
balanced mixture: As well as addressing completely new
business options, it is geared to securing and enhancing the
prospects of existing businesses. Alongside product and
Process innovations, the focus includes innovative business
models and product and process innovations. Our portfolio is
aligned to the differing business strategies of the various
business entities.

In view of the strategic importance of R&D, we have
raised R&D expenses by an average of 4 percent since 2013. In
2017, R&D expenses totaled €458 million. Our R&D projects
are managed using the multi-step Idea-to-Profit process
developed by Evonik to support the systematic development
of projects right up to profitable commercialization.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

R&D drivers at Evonik

Around 90 percent of our R&D is performed by our seg-
ments. That includes, first and foremost, research geared
specifically to their core technologies and markets and to the
development of new business. The Nutrition & Care and
Resource Efficiency growth segments will receive an
above-average share of our R&D funds so that they can enter
new markets through innovations and alliances. The Perfor-
mance Materials segment focuses on optimizing products and
processes. In addition, R&D is driven forward by Creavis,
our strategic innovation unit. Working closely with the seg-
ments, Creavis is engaged in research into new technologies.
It concentrates on mid- and long-term projects, which are
driven forward in a variety of ways. Its principal areas of
focus are Evonik’s innovation growth fields, and its work is
linked to the segments’ R&D activities. Examples are the
development of new gas separation membranes, which add
new technologies to our SEPURAN® platform.

On the basis of the identified potential in the strategic
growth fields, Creavis sets up project houses, which spend
three years working on research into a potential innovation in
conjunction with the segments and external experts. For
example, the Medical Devices Project House in the Health-
care Solutions growth field is currently working on new solu-
tions for medical technology and on extending Evonik’s com-
petence in biomaterials and polymers. In particular, it is
addressing applications in implantology.

Resource Efficiency

Evonik also obtains access to new technologies and business
options through its corporate venture capital activities. We
invest specifically in specialized technology funds and prom-
ising start-ups of strategic relevance to Evonik. This gives us
an insight into new technologies and business activities that
fit our growth strategy at a very early stage of development.
Products and technologies are developed in joint projects. In
this way we speed up our innovative process. Evonik has
been involved in the venture capital business since 2012 and

has made more than 20 investments in this time. In 2017,
Evonik’s investments included four start-ups and three funds.
Our investments in start-ups include NUMAFERM, a biotech-
nology company based in Dusseldorf (Germany). NUMAFERM
is working on more efficient production of peptides. Peptides
and their applications are of enormous interest for our Specialty
Additives and Health & Care growth engines. Evonik’s fund
investments include Digital Growth Fund | in Munich (Ger-
many). This fund provides capital for fast-growing young
IndustrialTech and FinTech companies with proven and
successful B2B business models. Our investment in Digital
Growth Fund | is a strong partnership that strengthens Evonik
in an important field of the future: digitalization. In addition,
we are driving forward precision livestock farming (PLF) for
poultry. Through our analytical services for amino acids we
already have experience of digital business models in agricul-
ture and we now aim to link these using modern digital tech-
nologies.

We regard our innovation culture, which is encouraged and
brought to life through our R&D activities, as a major factor in
our innovative capability. It determines whether—and how
fast—employees are able to identify and drive forward good
ideas and convert them into additional sales and earnings.
Alongside commitment, passion, and stamina, that entails the
strength to discontinue R&D projects if their prospects of suc
cess are too low, as well as a constructive attitude to mistakes.
We therefore regard Evonik as an open, learning company.

Opportunities offered by di
Evonik recognized the opportunities inherent in digital business
models at an early stage. We are consciously shaping the
necessary changes in the company. In the coming years,
Evonik intends to invest considerably in developing and testing
digital technologies and building up the related expertise.
Within the Evonik Group, Evonik Digital GmbH therefore
started to develop new digital business models and build up
digital competencies at the start of 2017. This Evonik entity
focuses on digital solutions and drives them forward after
successful testing in the Group. A major role here is played by
collaboration with well-known technology companies and
universities.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Responsible corporate management

Sustainability is a core element in our corporate claim “Power
to create.” Our products and solutions are used in many areas
that help to improve people’s lives and minimize the use of
scarce resources. In this way, we also aim to play a part in the
17 goals for sustainable development set by the United
Nations, to be achieved by 2030. In the reporting period, we
addressed these goals and their relevance for the Evonik
Group, individual operating units, and entire value chains in a
variety of ways.

Numerous voluntary commitments

Evonik is committed to the ten principles of the UN Global
Compact and is guided by the International Labour Standards
issued by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and
the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises published by the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD). In addition, we are involved in many networks such as
the “Chemie?” sustainability initiative of the German chemical
industry, and the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development (WBCSD). Together with our Code of Conduct,
our Global Social Policy (GSP) and our Environment, Safety,
Health and Quality (ESHQ) Values provide a framework for
responsible corporate management.

We are also committed to the WBCSD’s “Vision 2050,"
which describes the pathway to achieving a sustainable world
with around 9 billion people living well within the limits of
the planet by 2050.

Evonik’s stakeholder groups

Integrated sustainability strategy and

sustainability management

We are convinced that sustainable business activities and
responsible conduct by our management and staff at all levels
are vital for the future of our company. Our sustainability
strategy takes up the growth engines identified in our corpo-
rate strategy—Specialty Additives, Animal Nutrition, Smart
Materials, and Health & Care—and defines areas of action
geared to balanced management of economic, ecological,
and social factors.

The Executive Board bears overall responsibility for sus-
tainability. Direct responsibility is assigned to the Chief Human
Resources Officer, who is also responsible for all climate-related
aspects at Evonik. The Corporate Responsibility Division sets
the strategic framework for sustainability management and
coordinates the Group-wide implementation of the strategy
in close collaboration with other central functions and the
segments.

Intensive dialogue with stakeholders

Dialogue with our stakeholders is important to give us a bet-
ter understanding of different perspectives and regularly
review our own positions. Findings and impetus from our
stakeholder dialogues facilitate timely identification of
upcoming market developments, trends, opportunities, and
risks. That enables us to customize our products and solu-
tions to meet the needs of our customers and markets.

Employees

We use a variety of formats for dialogue with our stakeholders.
One example was an exchange of experience with represen-
tatives of churches, industrial unions, companies, and non-
governmental organizations on “Industry and Human Rights” in
June 2017. At the Evonik Perspectives expert forum in October
2017, the Corporate Responsibility Division and the Resource
Efficiency segment discussed opportunities and challenges
on the road to greater energy efficiency and more efficient
use of resources with more than 100 stakeholders. Important
feedback about our sustainability performance also comes
from talking with members of the investment community.

Impact analysis launched

Sustainability is a key criterion in many of our markets and is
increasingly becoming a growth driver. Our sustainability
analysis makes the contribution made by corresponding prod-
ucts and services to our business performance measurable. We
are continuously developing this methodology. In addition, we

5.1 Employees

Employees are the foundations of our success
Skilled and motivated employees are the key to Evonik’s
success. By providing an attractive working environment, we
want to ensure that our employees like to work for Evonik
and can develop their talents. All employees can fulfill their
potential. We foster the creativity of our employees and offer
them space to take their own route to innovative solutions.
We want to create an atmosphere based on trust, respect,
and openness. We reward performance and readiness to take
risks and we develop our own managers.

This is reflected in our human resources strategy, which is
divided into the following areas of action: attract, develop,
perform, retain, and lead.

Attract

Employer branding—Positioning as an

attractive employer

We seek out creative and competent employees with high
potential and offer them a working environment that fosters
ideas, rewards hard work, and maintains their mental and
physical employability. We also use these employer qualities
in the competition to attract the most talented employees and
managers to Evonik.

Our new employer branding campaign, #HumanChemistry,
is designed to make it clear that Evonik is an innovative and
increasingly more digital specialty chemicals company where
highly motivated employees and their abilities play a central
role.

have started to evaluate the positive and negative impacts of
Evonik’s business activities along the value chain on the
economy, the environment, and society in monetary terms.

Transparency in sustainability reporting

Transparent and open reporting of our sustainability activities is
important to us. The information channels provided for this
include our “Responsibility” website, which was redesigned in
2017, our extensive Sustainability Report, and, for the first time,
a separate non-financial report!. In addition, we are rated by
prestigious rating agencies: Evonik is positioned among the
leaders in the chemical industry in significant sustainability
ratings and is included in major sustainability-oriented index
families.

We received many accolades for our sustainability activi-
ties and sustainability reporting in 2017. That recognition is
an additional incentive for us to extend our commitment to
sustainability.

A variety of awards and surveys confirm that Evonik is
already one of Germany's most attractive employers. In the
Focus ranking, Evonik is still among the top-10 employers in
the chemical industry. In the B2B Social Media Ranking
(Brandwatch), Evonik shot up from 35th place in 2016 to first
place in 2017. In China, Evonik was once again included in
the list of the most popular employers published by the Top
Employer Institute in 2017.

Modern recruiting

To attract potential new employees, it is becoming increas-
ingly important to establish contact to relevant target groups
at an early stage. We therefore work specifically with
selected universities and higher education institutes around
the world.

Through the Evonik Perspectives program we remain in
contact with students whose performance in internships at
Evonik is above average. Many of the participants in this pro-
gram join Evonik when they finish their studies.

Develop

Further training to secure the future

We want to ensure timely identification of the potential of
our employees and talents and to foster, develop, and stretch
employees accordingly. Our intranet site provides transparent
and accessible information for all employees on opportunities
for continuing professional development, together with the
content and whom to contact.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

We need employees with the right mindset and the relevant
skills and competencies so we can address the digital trans-
formation and potentially disruptive changes. Through
#HumanWork, we aim to prepare our employees for tomor-
row’s world of work and the age of digitalization. To support
this necessary cultural change at Evonik, we established our
first rooms to test new working conditions in 2017. In these
New Work Labs our employees can make an active contribution
to aspects of Work 4.0.

For the continuing professional development of our
employees, we invested around €500 per employee in train-
ing alone in 2017.

Vocational training for present and future specialists
We still recruit specialists specifically from young people
within the company, and are committed to their develop-
ment. All employees hired following successful completion of
their vocational training are offered a clear perspective for
the future.

At year-end 2017, we had around 1,900 young people at
16 sites in Germany on more than 38 vocational training
courses and combined vocational training and study programs.
Around 390 of them were being trained on behalf of other
companies. Apprentices accounted for nearly 8 percent of our
workforce in Germany, which is still well above the national
average. A total of 90 places were offered on the “Start in den
Beruf” pre-apprenticeship project in the 2017/2018 academic
year, including 20 for refugees. Overall, we invested €65 mil-
lion in vocational training in Germany in 2017. That positions
Evonik among the best training companies in Germany.

Talent management—Developing

tomorrow's executives

Key positions are filled predominantly by talented employees
from within the company. To this end, we develop employees
with potential across hierarchical levels, functions, and organi-
zational units. Important objectives for talent development at
Evonik are personal responsibility, diversity, internationality,
and entrepreneurship. Alongside on-the-job development
through job rotation, involvement in projects, and international
postings, targeted programs are used to ensure the develop-
ment of our high potentials. In addition to demanding seminars
on aspects of leadership and management in collaboration
with major business schools such as IMD in Lausanne (Switzer-
land), we have established a further element geared to ethical
aspects, values, and personal development.

Options for personal behavior and responsibility are
addressed, discussed, and experienced through community
work in Vietnam, a special curriculum on ethics, values, and
moral aspects, and a program of reflection on the role of
companies in politics and society.

Perform

We regard a healthy performance culture as the basis for the
company’s success and the personal motivation of every indi-
vidual employee. Fair, performance-related remuneration
plays a central role in this, together with employees’ annual
performance and development review with their manager.

Remuneration—Performance-related pay

around the world

When shaping remuneration systems, Evonik believes it is
very important to offer specialists and executives market-
oriented and performance-related salaries. The remuneration
of many members of our workforce includes bonus payments
that are based on the company’s business performance and/
or their personal performance.

In addition, our employees in Germany, Belgium, and the
USA and, for the first time in 2017, staff in China and Singapore
are offered the “Share” employee share program. The partici-
pation rate rose for the third time in succession to a new
record of 41 percent.

Fringe benefits form part of overall remuneration

As a responsible employer, Evonik helps the majority of
employees build financial security to cover risks such as
accidents and disability and to provide for retirement, either
directly or through pension contributions to external institu-
tions. The arrangements are based on the economic, legal,
and tax situation in the various countries. Employer contribu-
tions to pension plans are an important element in competitive
overall remuneration packages, especially in Germany, the
USA, and some European countries. The pension plans in
Germany and the USA have been revised and aligned to the
future cost to Evonik as a result of demographic challenges.

Retain
Diversity enriches
We regard ourselves as an international company and see
diversity as an opportunity. Diversity means fostering creativity,
trying out new things, and better understanding the needs of
our customers. We see diversity of nationality, gender, edu-
cational background, and professional experience, as well as
a wide-ranging age structure in the workforce, as a clear
competitive advantage. For us, diversity means utilizing the
entire spectrum of experience, competencies, and viewpoints
that our employees contribute in their daily work.

Our diversity strategy includes gender networks as well
as clear diversity targets for managers. It is evaluated and
managed through a Group-wide Diversity Council.

Work-life balance
Healthy and motivated employees are vital for Evonik’s suc
cess and an integral part of our corporate responsibility. We
respect the individual needs and personal aspirations of our
employees. Therefore, it is very important to us that our
employees find a balance between work and their private
lives. We offer flexible worktime models and concrete mea-
sures to support them in the various phases of their lives. Our
well@work program covers all aspects that maintain and
improve the employability and quality of life of our employees.
Core elements are support in child care and flexible
worktime models.

Including employee interests in our corporate culture
Our corporate culture determines how we treat one another
and our success. Regular surveys on our corporate culture are
therefore important to us so we are aware of our employees’
attitudes and can include them in decisions. In 2017, we
conducted an executive survey of the top 200 executives at
Evonik. This will be followed in 2018 by our regular
employee survey, which is conducted every three years and
covers the approximately 36,000 employees in the Evonik
Group.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Leadership

Clear, consistent, cooperative

The heart of our leadership culture is a trustful relationship
between employees and managers. Here we focus on three
dimensions: clear instructions, consistent action, and a cooper-
ative approach to our employees. Our aim is to ensure that sin-
cere and effective leadership is a distinctive quality at all Evonik
sites. Following our executive survey, Share your wisdom, in
spring 2017 we therefore launched a continuous dialogue
between our Executive Board and Group executives.

A considerable increase in headcount due

to growth and acquisitions

At year-end 2017, the Evonik Group had 36,523 employees,
2,172 more than at year-end 2016. The increase resulted princi-
pally from the acquisition of the Air Products specialty additives
business (1,097 employees) and the Huber silica business
(692 employees) as well as investment in growth projects in
the Health & Care and Resource Efficiency segments. At the
same time, there were some headcount reductions due to
implementation of the Administration Excellence program to
enhance efficiency and some small optimization programs in
the chemical segments.

5.2 Safety and environment

Safety as a management task

We take our responsibility in the field of safety particularly
seriously—during production and while shipping products to
our customers. Our objective is to protect our employees and
local residents as well as the environment from any potential
negative impact of our activities. The Group-wide Safety at
Evonik initiative has become firmly established as an ongoing
process to develop our safety culture and as a fundamental
management approach to all aspects of occupational and traffic
safety. Our guiding principles for safety and our safety culture
provide a structure and guidance for our corporate targets
es. Binding principles are applicable for all
employees, from local personnel to our management, and
provide clear and measurable guidance for their personal
conduct and leadership.

and acti

Incident frequency indicator improved slightly

and was within the defined limit

A special focus of our initiative is the safety of our employ-
ees—both at work and on the way to and from work—and
the safety of contractors working at our sites. In 2017, the
accident frequency indicator! for our employees was 1.16,
which was within our defined maximum limit of 1.30. That
was a slight improvement compared with the previous year
(1.24). Discussing the accidents provided valuable pointers for
future accident prevention, and these have been communicated
to our employees.

In the year under review, there was one fatal accident involving
an Evonik employee. There were no fatal accidents involving
contractors’ employees, nor any fatal traffic accidents involv-
ing employees on the way to or from work or on business trips.
The accident frequency indicator for contractors (number
of work-related accidents involving non-Evonik employees
resulting in absence from work per 1 million working hours)
increased slightly year-on-year to 3.52 (2016: 3.15).*

Incident frequency indicator at a very good level
Process safety at our plants is another focus of our initiative.
The concepts to prevent fire and the release of hazardous
substances are regularly analyzed in detail. The aim is timely
identification of risks so we can develop appropriate mea-
sures that reliably prevent these risks. We monitor and
evaluate plant safety using the incident frequency indicator.
In 2017, this indicator was 1.11 and therefore fell slightly short
of our target. Nevertheless, it was still at a very good level.

Safety and environment

Ambitious environmental targets

Protecting our environment and the climate are major global
challenges of our age, along with the efficient use of limited
natural resources in the face of the growing world population
and increasing affluence. Maintaining the natural basis of life
for future generations is part of our corporate responsibility.
Key areas of action in the ecological arena can be derived
from efficiency requirements. For us, that principally means
reducing energy consumption, minimizing emissions into the
air and water, and efficient water management.

We also develop products that contribute to forging a
clear link between economic success and ecological progress.
However, improving our ecological footprint and remaining
internationally competitive are also dependent on public
acceptance and political opportunity. These conditions are
reflected in our strategic focus.

We have set demanding environmental targets for the period
2013-2020 (reference base: 2012):

+ Reduce specific greenhouse gas emissions! by 12 percent.
+ Reduce specific water intake? by 10 percent.

In sustainable waste management, we are continuing our
efforts to make more efficient use of resources.

In 2017, we made further progress in reducing emissions at
all stages in the value chain. A functioning environmental
management system is the basis for this. Integrating it into
our corporate processes is an ongoing task and an integral
part of our sustainability management. At Evonik, account-
ability for plants, technical systems, products, and processes
is therefore assigned to the responsible members of staff, for
example, through job descriptions and letters of delegation.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Our environment, safety, health, and quality management
system is binding for the entire Evonik Group. In addition, we
require our production sites to be validated as conforming to
the internationally recognized environmental management
standard ISO 14001. As a result of the necessary start-up and
preparatory phase for new units, the proportion of output
covered by ISO 14001 validation varies. However, it is always
between 95 and 100 percent. Audits are conducted to monitor
implementation by the segments, regions, and sites. Alongside
audits on specific issues, we conducted 55 ESHQ audits
worldwide in 2017.

Carbon Disclosure Project—Climate

reporting at a high level

Corporate growth potential arises from the systematic align-
ment of products and services to global megatrends. That
includes the challenge of global climate change. Many innova-
tive products from Evonik help improve energy efficiency at
subsequent stages in the value chain, reduce the use of
resources, and cut emissions.

In the area of reporting key environmental indicators,
Evonik is engaged in intensive exchange with rating agencies
such as the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). In 2017, we
confirmed the very good CDP Climate Change score of “A-"
obtained in 2016.

Slightly higher CO, emissions?
Output increased from 10.6 million metric tons to 11.0 million
tons in 2017. About half of this increase came from the first-
time consolidation of the Air Products specialty additives facil-
ities.* CO, emissions increased from 9.4 million metric tons in
2016 to 9.8 million metric tons. In addition to higher output,
this was attributable to routine shutdowns at gas power plants
and the related increase in the use of the coal-fired power
plant in Marl (Germany).

The 26 facilities operated by Evonik that fall within the
scope of the European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU
ETS) emitted 3.8 million metric tons of CO, in 2017.

1 Energy- and process-related emissions as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Scope 2 emissions measured using the market-based method.

2 Excluding site-specific factors in the use of surface water or groundwater.

3 Direct CO, emissions (Scope 1 emissions under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol) come from energy generation and production. Indirect CO, emissions (Scope 2 emissions)
come from purchased energy. Gross emissions measured using the market-based method.
4 The silica business acquired from Huber will only be included in the environmental data from 2018.

6. Opportunity and risk report

6.1 Opportunity and risk management

Risk strategy

Evonik’s Group-wide internal opportunity and risk management
(referred to generically as risk management in this section)
forms a central element in the management of the company.
Our risk management includes a risk detection system, which
meets the requirements for publicly listed companies. The
aims are to identify risks as early as possible and to define
measures to counter and minimize them. To ensure optimal use
is made of opportunities, these also need to be recognized
and tracked from an early stage. We only enter into entrepre-
neurial risks if we are convinced that in this way we can gen-
erate a sustained rise in the value of the company and, at the
same time, permanently limit possible negative implications.

Structure and organization of risk management
At Group level, risk management is assigned to the Chief
Financial Officer and is organized on a decentralized basis in
line with Evonik’s organizational structure.

The segments, corporate divisions, and service units bear
prime responsibility for risk management. That comprises early

Structure of risk management

identification of risks and estimating their implications. Further-
more, suitable preventive and control measures have to be
introduced and internal communication of risks must be
ensured. Risk coordinators in the organizational units are
responsible for agreeing on the relevant risk management
activities. At all levels in the Group, systematic and timely risk
reporting is a key element in strategic and operational plan-
ning, the preparation of investment decisions, projections,
and other management and decision-making processes.

A central Corporate Risk Officer coordinates and oversees
the processes and systems. He is the contact for all risk coordi-
nators and is responsible for information, documentation, and
coordination at Group level. Further responsibilities include
ongoing development of the methodology used by the risk
management system. The Risk Committee is chaired by the
Chief Financial Officer and composed of representatives of the
corporate divisions. It validates the Group-wide risk situation
and verifies that it is adequately reflected in financial reporting.
The Supervisory Board, especially the Audit Committee, over-
sees the risk management system.

MANAGEMENT REPORT

Opportunity and risk report
Opportunity and risk management
Overall assessment of opportunities and risks

In 2017, risk management again included all consolidated
companies in the Evonik Group. At companies where we do
not exert a controlling influence, we implement our risk
Management requirements primarily through our presence in
management and supervisory bodies.

Corporate Audit monitors risk management in our orga-
nizational units to make sure they comply with statutory and
internal requirements and to ensure continuous improvement
of risk management. The risk detection system is included in
the annual audit in compliance with the requirements for
listed companies. This audit showed that Evonik’s risk detec
tion system is suitable for timely identification of risks that
could pose a threat to the company’s survival.

The risk management system is based on the internationally
recognized COSO Enterprise Management standard. It is
implemented through a binding Group-wide policy. Individual
risks are systematically identified and managed with the aid of
special risk management software. Their probability of occur-
rence and the possible damage (potential impact) are evaluated
and documented, together with their expected value (product

of probability of occurrence and potential impact). Analo-
gously to current planning, the evaluation is based on a
period of three years (mid-term planning). Opportunities and
risks are defined as positive and negative deviations from the
plan. The relevant indicators include adjusted EBITDA. In
addition, longer-term opportunities and risks, including those
relating to sustainability, are included.

The organizational units conduct an extensive annual risk
inventory in connection with the mid-term planning process.
They are required to provide details of the measures to be
taken with regard to the risks identified, introduce them
immediately, and track their timely implementation. Internal
management (for example, reporting by the Risk Committee)
takes a mid-term view. The opportunities and risks identified
are classified as low, moderate, or high (see opportunity and
risk matrix). The evaluation is always based on a net view, in
other words, taking into account risk limitation measures. Risk
limitation measures can reduce, transfer, or avoid gross risks.
Common measures include economic counter-action, insurance,
and the establishment of provisions on the balance sheet.

Probability of occurrence

The risk inventory is supplemented by quarterly reviews of
all opportunities and risks relating to the present year both to
spot changes in the opportunities and risks that have already
been identified and to identify new risks and opportunities.

All high risks and opportunities are classified as material
individual risks and opportunities, as are moderate risks and
opportunities with an expected value of over €100 million in
the mid term. The expected value is used exclusively as a
basis for prioritization and to focus reporting on key issues.

6.2 Overall assessment of opportunities and risks

Given the measures planned and implemented, no risks have
been identified that—either individually or in conjunction
with other risks—could jeopardize the continued existence of
Evonik as a whole, including Evonik Industries AG in its role
as the holding company for the Group.

For 2017 we expected more risks than opportunities. During
the year, there were some opportunities and risks whose
overall effects canceled each other out. Pleasingly, in the

Resource Efficiency and Performance Materials segments we
were mainly able to realize opportunities, especially in Cy
chemicals and methacrylates. In the Nutrition & Care seg-
ment, considerably more risks than opportunities materialized,
especially in the market for amino acids. Our reporting distin-
guishes between the categories market and competition risks,
legal and compliance risks, and process and organization
risks. The main parameters influencing the risk categories in
terms of both opportunities realized and risks that materialized

FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

resulted from the development of specific market and com-
petition situations. From the present standpoint, the risks for
2018 again outweigh the potential opportunities. Compared
with 2017, there has been a slight increase in the risks for the
Evonik Group, while the opportunities have increased consid-
erably.

Material individual risks and opportunities for the Evonik
Group are changes in exchange rates and the development of
margins for C, chemicals. Further material risks relate to the

development of amino acid prices and the overall economic
development. Measures to reduce the risks include general
economic mitigation measures and, especially with regard to
changes in exchange rates, the use of hedging instruments.
Sections 6.3 and 6.4 present the material individual risks and
opportunities, along with further opportunities and risks in
each category. Except where otherwise indicated, they apply
for all segments.

6.3 Market and competition opportunities and risks

In accordance with our internal management, opportunities
and risks in the market and competition category are allo-
cated to risk quantification classes within sub-categories. The
chart shows the highest class to which an individual risk
or opportunity is allocated in each sub-category. Individual

Opportunity and risk classes within the market and competition category

opportunities and risks may also be allocated to the lower risk
classes. Where two sub-categories have the same profile in

The development of the global economy entails both oppor-
tunities and risks for Evonik. If economic growth strengthens or
weakens, for example, due to political developments, changes
in interest rate and exchange rate policy, or the development
of key sectors of the economy (e.g., the banking and real
estate sectors), this can have an impact on demand in market
segments of relevance to Evonik. That in turn can influence
Evonik’s earnings and cash flows. Evonik counters these eco-
nomic risks by constantly monitoring the macroeconomic
environment, optimizing cost structures and competitive
positions in its established areas of business, and extending
businesses in its portfolio with low cyclical exposure.
Alongside the general demand situation, intensive competi-
tion in the various market segments harbors both opportunities

and risks. These may result from either demand in specific
markets or from the competitive situation in various industries.
Changes in demand can have a considerable impact on our
business volume and sales. In addition, competitors in low-wage
countries in particular can increase competitive pressure
through new capacities and aggressive pricing policies that can
impair our selling prices and volume trends. To counter this we
are broadening our foreign production base and gaining
access to new markets in high-growth regions such as Asia and
South America. To reduce these risks, the operating units
affected also use various methods of increasing customer loyalty
and gaining new customers, enter into research alliances with
customers, and extend the services offered along the value
chain.

MANAGEMENT REPORT

Opportunity and risk report
Market and competition opportunities and risks

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

On the other hand, opportunities arise for our businesses
from unmet demand in individual markets, for example, if our
competitors are unable to bring planned new capacity into
service on schedule. In 2017, there was an increase in shut-
downs of production facilities in China, including those oper-
ated by our competitors, to improve environmental protection
and occupational safety. Our production facilities worldwide
are based on modern standards and have high levels of occu-
pational and environmental safety, so we see an opportunity to
increase our market share.

We are constantly developing attractive and competitive new
products and technologies to mitigate the risk that chemical
products could be replaced by new, improved, or less expen-
sive materials or technologies. One potential risk factor for
our amino acids business, for example in Asia, is the possible
impact of substandard food quality and food safety, especially
due to bird flu. We utilize opportunities for profitable future
growth by gaining access to new markets as part of our stra-
tegic development. One attractive market for our amino acids
business is aquaculture, for which we have developed inno-
vative products. As a result of global population growth, rising
affluence in emerging markets, and overfishing of the world’s
oceans, the global aquaculture market is growing faster than
other areas of livestock farming.

Customer concentration is basically low in our chemicals
segments. None of the end-markets that we supply accounts for
more than 20 percent of sales. Nevertheless, some operational
units, especially in the Nutrition & Care and Resource Efficiency
segments, and the Services segment have a certain dependence
on key customers. In the operating business, this applies in
particular to production facilities erected in the direct vicinity
of major customers. The possible loss of a major customer could
result in lower sales and in impairment losses on receivables and
investments, as well as impacting our long-term raw material
agreements or the financial structure of our affiliates.

2. Financial markets

As a tule, liquidity, credit default, currency, and interest rate
risks and the risks relating to pension obligations are man-
aged centrally. All material financial risk positions are identi-
fied and evaluated in accordance with Group-wide policies
and principles. This forms the basis for selective hedging to
limit risks. In the use of derivative and non-derivative financial

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

instruments to minimize the risks, Evonik applies the principle
of separation of front office, risk controlling, and back office
functions and takes as its guide the banking-specific “Mini-
mum Requirements for Risk Management” (MaRisk) and the
requirements of the German legislation on corporate control
and transparency (KonTraG). Financial derivatives! are only
used in connection with corresponding hedged items.

Exchange rate volatility

Transaction-related exchange rate risks arise from the trans-
lation of operating monetary assets and liabilities on the balance
sheet into the functional currency of the respective Group
company. The resulting net risk is normally hedged in full
using derivatives. Further, our transaction-related currency
management takes account of forecast cash inflows and out-
flows, which are hedged on the basis of forecast transactions,
with a target hedging rate of up to 75 percent. Material
opportunities and risks may arise from the remaining
unhedged items and from discrepancies between the actual
future rates and the average rates used to hedge forecast
transactions. Scenario analyses are performed to estimate and
control such risks and opportunities. These focus on the main
foreign currencies of relevance for the Evonik Group, the US
dollar, Chinese renminbi yuan, and the Singapore dollar. In
view of the rising importance of regions outside the euro
zone, risks and opportunities relating to transactions in foreign
currencies will increase in the long term. In addition, there
are currency-related risks from the translation of separate
financial statements. Further, economic risks arise because
exchange rates influence our competitiveness in global markets.

Risk of changes in interest rates

Potential changes in capital market rates result in opportunities
and risks. These comprise, on the one hand, changes in the
fair value of fixed-interest financial instruments and, on the
other, changes in interest payments on variable-rate financial
instruments. To control these risks, when setting interest rate
terms Evonik pays special attention to the structure of the
fixed-floating relationship and uses interest rate swaps for
further optimization where appropriate. Through the use of
fixed-interest loans and interest rate hedging instruments,
77 percent of all financial liabilities were classified as fixed-
interest as of the reporting date, and therefore had no material
exposure to changes in interest rates.

1 Further details of the financial derivatives used and their recognition and measurement can be found in Note 9.2 to the consolidated financial statements,

FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Liquidity risks

To manage the Group's solvency, Evonik uses central liquidity
risk management." At its heart is a Group-wide cash pool. In
addition, our financial independence is secured through a
broadly diversified financing structure and our good rating.
Overall, we believe that adequate financing instruments are
available to ensure sufficient liquidity at all times.

Default risks

Default risks involve the risk of a loss if our debtors are fully
or partially unable to meet their payment commitments. The
credit risk of our customers and financial counterparties is
therefore systematically examined when the contracts are
concluded and monitored continuously afterwards. Limits are
set for each contractual partner on the basis of internal or
rating-based creditworthiness analyses.

Financial risks in connection with pension obligations
Both opportunities and risks may arise from potential changes
in the parameters used to evaluate our pension obligations.?
Changes, especially in interest rates, but also in mortality
rates and rates of salary increases can alter the present value
of pension obligations, which directly alters equity and can
result in changes in the expenses for pension plans.

Market opportunities and risks, and liquidity and default
risks relating to financial instruments also arise from the
management of our pension plan assets. We counter these
risks through an active risk management approach, combined
with detailed risk controlling. Strategic management of the
portfolios takes place via regular active/passive studies. To
minimize risk, we use derivative hedging strategies where
appropriate. The broad diversification of asset classes, portfolio
sizes, and asset managers avoids cluster risks but there are
unavoidable residual risks in the individual investments.

Impairment risk

The risk of asset impairment arises when the interest rate
used in an impairment test rises, the forecast cash flows
decline, or investment projects are halted. In the present
business environment, we do not see a material risk of
impairment of goodwill or individual assets. This also applies
to investments, which are recognized in the balance sheet at
their present market value in accordance with IAS 39.

3. Raw material markets

For our business operations we require both high-volume
commodities and smaller amounts of strategically relevant raw
materials that have to meet highly demanding specifications.
In both cases, Evonik is confronted with opportunities and
risks relating to the increasing volatility of the availability of
raw materials and their prices.

The operating business is dependent on the price of strate-
gic raw materials, especially petrochemical feedstocks
obtained directly or indirectly from crude oil. The price of
renewable raw materials is also highly volatile and is driven,
for example, by weather-dependent harvest yields. Structural
changes in exchange rates are another significant aspect
affecting price risks. These risks are hedged by optimizing
the global focus of procurement activities, for example by
accessing new markets and concluding market-oriented
agreements. To further reduce the price risks with regard to
products that have intensive raw material requirements, our aim
is to pass both the risks and the opportunities of fluctuations
in raw material prices along to other stages in the value chain
where necessary, for example, through price escalation
clauses.

The overriding aim of the procurement strategy is to secure
the availability of raw materials on the best possible business
terms. Short- and mid-term bottlenecks in the availability of
precursors and intermediates are potential risks. As well as
making preparations to use substitute suppliers in an emer-
gency, we constantly observe the business performance of
suppliers of selected key raw materials to anticipate bottle-
necks and avoid risks.

Increasing volatility requires constant monitoring of the
corresponding risks in the value chain.

The opportunities and risks arising from changes in the
price of petrochemical feedstocks mainly affect the Perfor-
mance Materials segment because of its high procurement
volume. Risks relating to single sourcing and short-term
restrictions on the availability of raw materials mainly affect
the Nutrition & Care and Resource Efficiency segments.

Supply chain

Ensuring that the supply chain meets sustainability criteria is
a central aspect of procurement. We expect our suppliers to
share our principles of entrepreneurial responsibility. We
therefore have our own code of conduct for suppliers, based
on the principles of the UN Global Compact, the Interna-
tional Labour Standards issued by the International Labour

1 A detailed overview of liquidity risks and their management can be found in Note 9.2 to the consolidated financial statements. Details of the financing of the Evonik
Group and action to protect liquidity can be found in the section on financial condition.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Organization (ILO), and the Responsible Care® initiative.
Globally, this approach to sustainability is also supported by the
sector initiative Together for Sustainability, of which Evonik
is a founding member, through the use of standardized assess-
ments. Evonik’s principal suppliers and the majority of critical
suppliers have already taken part in these assessments, which
are evaluated by an impartial sustainability rating company.

4. Human resources

As a global corporation, we respect the principles of the
International Charter of Human Rights, the ten principles of the
UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises, and the International Labour Standards of the
International Labour Organization (ILO). Compliance with all
employment laws is especially important to us.

Qualified specialists and managers are the basis for the
achievement of our strategic and operational targets and thus
a key competitive factor. Both the loss of key personnel and
difficulties in attracting and hiring skilled and talented staff
could therefore constitute a risk in this context.

To ensure that we can recruit and retain qualified staff to
meet our future requirements, we offer varied employment
opportunities worldwide, systematic personnel development,
and competitive remuneration. As a responsible employer,
Evonik helps the majority of employees build financial security
to cover adverse risk factors and provide for retirement,
either directly or through pension contributions to external
institutions. The arrangements are based on the economic,
legal, and tax situation in the various countries. In addition,
we take care of our employees’ personal welfare through
programs such as well@work. In this way, we retain and
foster high-performers and talented employees, and position
Evonik as an attractive employer for prospective staff. We
also maintain close links to universities and professional
associations to help us recruit suitable youngsters. Both our
employer branding and many internal activities are aligned to
diversity. The aim is to make Evonik even more attractive to
talented specialists and managers."

Strategic human resources planning identifies require-
ments for a five-year period so timely steps can be taken to
cover future personnel needs. We have thus largely limited
potential human resources risks. Opportunities and risks for
the development of personnel expenses could come, for
example, from future collective agreements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

5. Production

As a specialty chemicals company, Evonik is exposed to the
risk of business interruptions, quality problems, and unex-
pected technical difficulties. We use complex production
processes, some of them with interdependent production
steps. Consequently, disruption and stoppages can adversely
affect subsequent production steps and products. The outage of
production facilities and interruptions in production work-
flows could have a significant negative influence on business
and earnings performance, and could also harm people and
the environment. Group-wide policies on project and quality
management, highly qualified employees, and regular main-
tenance of our plants effectively minimize these risks. Insofar
as is economically viable, we take out insurance to cover
damage to our plants and sites and production stoppages, so
the financial consequences of potential production risks are
largely insured. Nevertheless, there is a risk of unforeseeable
individual incidents.

6. Mergers & acquisitions

Active portfolio management has high priority for Evonik as
part of our value-based management approach. We have set
out clear procedures for preparing, analyzing, and undertaking
acquisitions and divestments. In particular, these include clear
rules on accountability and approval processes. An intensive
examination of potential acquisition targets (due diligence) is
undertaken before they are acquired. This involves systematic
identification of all major opportunities and risks and an
appropriate valuation. Key aspects of this process are strategic
focus, earnings power, and development potential on the one
hand, and any legal, financial, and environmental risks on the
other. New companies are rapidly integrated into the Group
and thus into our risk management and controlling processes.
Every transaction of this type entails a risk that integration of
the business may not be successful or that integration costs
may be unexpectedly high, thus jeopardizing realization of the
planned quantitative and qualitative targets such as synergies.

In the integration of the Air Products specialty additives
business and the Huber silica business, which were acquired in
2017, Evonik is paying special attention to the identified risks
and the related measures.

Where businesses no longer fit our strategy or meet our
profitability requirements despite optimization, we also examine
external options. If a planned divestment is not achieved
successfully, this could generate risks that impact the Group’s
earnings position.

7. Other

A steady improvement in our cost position is necessary to
make us more competitive. Our goal is to achieve a lasting
reduction of €200 million in selling and administrative
expenses by 2021. We will be working out specific measures
in the coming months. Beside the potential to raise strategic
flexibility and strengthen the operating units as a result of
these programs and other restructuring projects, there are
risks relating to their implementation. These include delays in
implementation, the loss of key personnel, ineffectiveness of
measures, and higher costs for the realization of measures.
Stringent project management, including involving relevant
stakeholders, is used to counter these risks.

8. Research & development

Opportunities for Evonik also come from market-oriented
research & development (R&D), which we regard as an
important driver of profitable growth. We have a well-
stocked R&D pipeline with a balanced mixture of short-,
mid-, and long-term R&D projects. On the one hand, we
constantly strive to improve our processes in order to
strengthen our cost leadership, and on the other, our projects
open the door to new markets and new fields of technology.
Our project portfolio is consistently aligned to our growth
engines and innovation growth fields.

Through our venture capital program, we take stakes in
companies whose know-how can support us in joint develop-
ments. Aspects of digitalization are becoming more significant.

Opportunities and risks in R&D relate to the viability of
planned product and process developments and the timing of
their implementation. We mainly see opportunities arising
from the introduction of new products that go beyond our
present planning in the innovation growth fields.

9. Investments
Generating growth through investment entails risks as
regards the proposed scope and timing of projects. These
risks are addressed through established, structured processes.
For instance, we take an extremely disciplined approach to
implementing our investment program. Both projects that
have not yet started and those that are already underway are
constantly reviewed for changes in the market situation and
postponed if necessary.

At the same time, we regard building new production
facilities in regions with high growth momentum as an
opportunity to generate further profitable growth. For example,

socio-economic megatrends are driving the development of
our amino acids business. Following the successful start-up
of a world-scale facility for DL-methionine in Singapore in
fall 2014, we are planning to erect another plant at this com-
plex by 2019. Global population growth means that demand
for animal protein will continue to rise steadily in the future.
Moreover, environmentally compatible agricultural produc
tion that makes more efficient use of resources is becoming
more important worldwide for ecological reasons.

Resource efficiency is the basis for a large number of
energy-efficient and environment-friendly products from
Evonik. One example is precipitated silica, where we are a
market leader. Combining precipitated silica with silanes
allows the manufacture of tires with considerably lower rolling
resistance than conventional auto tires, resulting in fuel savings
of up to 8 percent. Here, future growth will be supported,
among other factors, by the introduction of tire labeling reg-
ulations in further countries. To utilize the resultant opportu-
nities, we are selectively increasing our capacity for silica. For
instance, a new production facility was taken into service in
Brazil in 2016 and a further production facility for precipitated
silica will be constructed in the USA by the end of 2018.

The investments described above are included in our mid-
term planning.

10. Energy markets

Evonik requires considerable amounts of energy from a wide
variety of sources for its chemical facilities and infrastructure.
The main sources are natural gas, electricity, and coal. At sev-
eral major sites, our power and steam requirements are fully
or partially met by resource-efficient co-generation plants. In
2017, we continued our constant monitoring of trends on the
national and international energy markets, enabling us to
respond in a risk- and cost-conscious manner.

In countries where the sourcing of energy is not state-
regulated, we procured and traded in energy and, where nec-
essary, emission allowances (CO, allowances) within the
framework of defined risk strategies. The aim is to balance
the risks and opportunities of volatile energy markets.
Depending on how the general conditions develop, our
segments could be faced with additional costs.

Here, risks could come from the structure of the fourth
trading period of the emissions trading system (2021-2030),
which could possibly include tighter rules for the allocation of
free allowances. In the broader regulatory context of the
energy markets, the way in which the cost of renewables is
allocated among captive energy generators in Germany is of
particular significance for Evonik, especially in view of the legal
framework in Europe. That said, in principle we assume that

captive generation will continue to contribute to the competi-
tiveness of our German sites in the future. Possible costs could
arise from the increase in grid feed fees and changes in the grid
fee system due to the shift in German energy policy. Overall,

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market price and cost of
various energy sources as a result of the specific demand/sup-
ply situation and political events. These entail both opportuni-
ties and risks.

6.4 Legal/compliance risks and opportunities

The opportunities and risks in this category are far more
difficult to quantify than market and competition risks, as
they not only have financial implications but often also
involve reputational risks for the company and/or criminal
law consequences. Provisions are set up on our balance sheet
to cover the financial impact. These are reflected in our sys-
tem as reducing risk. In view of this complexity, legal /com-
pliance opportunities and risks are not assigned to the oppor-
tunity/risk matrix illustrated above, nor are they allocated to
the risk quantification classes.

1. Compliance, law, and the regulatory framework
Compliance means lawful business conduct. All forms of cor-
ruption, including “facilitation payments,” are prohibited at
Evonik. All employees are subject to the binding regulations
on fair treatment of each other and of business partners set
out in our Code of Conduct. Risks could therefore result
from failure to comply with the corresponding regulations.
To minimize compliance risks, extensive training and sensiti-
zation of employees is undertaken at face-to-face training
sessions and/or through e-learning programs. Our Code of
Conduct is binding for all employees of the Evonik Group
worldwide, including the Executive Board and the gover-
nance bodies of all Evonik companies. They are required to
comply with the rules set forth in the Code of Conduct, to
ensure they are familiar with its content, and to take part in
the relevant training.’

Evonik monitors the observance of human rights along
its value chain. To minimize the related risks, we require
compliance with the Evonik Supplier Code of Conduct, our
Global Social Policy, and the Policy Statement on Human
Rights.

Evonik is exposed to legal risks, resulting, for example, from
legal disputes such as claims for compensation, and from
administrative proceedings and fines. In its operating busi-
ness, the Evonik Group is exposed to liability risks, especially
in connection with product liability, patent law, tax law, com-
petition law, antitrust law, and environmental law. Changes
in public law could also give rise to legal risks or materially

1 See declaration on corporate governance.

alter such risk positions. As a chemicals company with its
own power plants, risks of particular relevance here are a
possible change in the charges levied under the German
Alternative Energies Act (EEG) and amendments to the Euro-
pean emissions trading regulations.

Further, Evonik may be liable for guarantee claims relating
to divestments. Structured post-transaction management
closely monitors any liability and guarantee risks resulting
from divestments. We have developed a concept involving
high quality and safety standards to ensure a controlled
approach to such legal risks.

Insurance cover has been purchased for the financial con-
sequences of any damage that may nevertheless occur as a
result of damage to property, product liability claims, and
other risks. Where necessary, Evonik sets up provisions for
legal risks.

At present, the relevant legal risks are the issues outlined
below. As a matter of principle, we refrain from evaluating
the opportunities and risks of potential legal proceedings or
proceedings that have commenced, in order not to influence
our position.

Evonik is currently involved in three ongoing appraisal
proceedings in connection with the settlement paid to former
shareholders. The background relates to the following corpo-
rate restructuring measures: the domination and profit-and-
loss agreement concluded with RUTGERS GmbH (formerly
RUTGERS AG) in 1999, the squeeze-out of non-controlling
interests in RUTGERS AG (now RUTGERS GmbH) in 2003,
and the squeeze-out of non-controlling interests in Degussa
AG (now Evonik Degussa GmbH) in 2006. The appraisal
proceedings comprise a court review of the appropriateness
of cash settlements or compensation.

In connection with the divestment of the former carbon
black activities, the purchaser has requested indemnification
from environmental guarantees relating to alleged infringe-
ment of the US Clean Air Act. Evonik is currently engaged
in a dispute with the purchaser on this.

Following a fine imposed by the EU Commission in 2002
on various methionine producers (including Evonik), the Bra-
zilian antitrust authorities have filed proceedings against


--- Page 45 ---

54

FINANCIAL REPORT 2017 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Evonik in connection with the delivery of methionine to Brazil.
Evonik is of the opinion that a fine cannot be imposed due to
the statute of limitations.

Furthermore, following completion of administrative
proceedings outside Germany, it is not improbable that indi-
vidual customers could file claims for compensation.

With regard to employment law, there are risks relating,
for example, to recalculation of pension commitments
entered into by Evonik and its legal predecessors.

Tax risks relate to differences in the valuation of business
processes, capital expenditures, restructuring by the financial
authorities, tax reforms in some countries, and potential retro-
active payments in the wake of tax audits.

2. Information security and the protection of

intellectual property and know-how
Innovations play a significant part in Evonik’s business
success. Protecting know-how and intellectual property is
therefore of central importance. With markets growing ever
closer and the globalization of business, a competent
approach to protecting our competitive edge is a key element
in our investment activities. The company is also exposed to a
risk that intellectual property cannot be adequately protected,
even through patents, especially when building new production
facilities in certain countries. Similarly, the transfer of know-
how in joint ventures and other forms of cooperation also
entails a risk of an outflow of expertise from Evonik. For
example, in the event of the possible separation from a joint
venture or other cooperation partner there is no guarantee
that the business partner will not continue to use know-how
transferred or disclose it to third parties, thereby damaging
Evonik’s competitive position.

Measures to minimize and avoid such risks are coordinated
by the Corporate Security Division and the Intellectual Property
Management unit.

IT risks

Electronic information processing is a key element in Evonik’s
success. Therefore, sustained protection of information and the
availability, confidentiality, and integrity of IT-assisted business
Processes are especially important. If these systems and infor-
mation are compromised, this can have a detrimental effect on
our business and production processes.

To protect them and the associated knowledge from cyber
criminality (including industrial espionage and manipulation
through electronic attacks) from both within and outside the
Group and to minimize such risks, Evonik has developed an IT
security strategy and established organizational and technical
measures. The secure use of information systems is described
in binding Group-wide policies and regulations and driven
forward and monitored by an internal control system.

In view of the considerable and continuously rising threat, we
regularly review our security measures, implement risk-based
countermeasures as required, and adapt them wherever
necessary. Training, including compulsory training in some
cases, and constant information, for example, via the Evonik
Group intranet and internal social networking platforms,
keep employees aware of the need for IT security. Strictly
confidential information that Evonik needs to protect is iden-
tified and corresponding protective measures are imple-
mented. At the same time, managers’ awareness of this issue
is raised. The Evonik Computer Emergency Response Team
(CERT) is networked externally at various levels (Germany:
member of the German CERT network, Europe: member of
TF-CSIRT, globally: member of FIRST).

3. Environmental risks (environment,

safety, health, quality)

Evonik is exposed to risks in the areas of occupational and
plant safety. For example, workplace accidents and incidents
in production facilities can cause injury to our employees or
substance releases that impair the health of our employees
and local residents. We counter these risks by living our
understanding of safety as a holistic management task at all
management levels. Our guiding principles for safety are
binding for all managers and employees. In this way, Evonik
makes it clear that safety is a central element in its corporate
culture. We analyze accidents and incidents carefully so we
can learn from them. Moreover, audits are conducted at
the request of the Executive Board to check the controlled
handling of such risks.

The aim of our product stewardship is timely identification
and evaluation of possible health and environmental risks in
our portfolio. We examine the entire value chain of each of
our products—from procurement of the raw materials to
delivery to our industrial customers, who receive all relevant
information on the handling and disposal of our products.
That includes, for example, safety data sheets and technical
information sheets. As well as complying with all statutory
requirements such as the European Chemicals Regulation
(REACH) and the Globally Harmonized System of Classification
and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS), product stewardship at
Evonik includes voluntary commitments that go beyond these
regulations.

Further risks may result from environmental regulations.

Furthermore, the Group-wide environmental protection
and quality management system, which is validated as
conforming to international standards, undergoes constant
development and improvement. As a responsible chemicals
company, Evonik ensures that such processes are operated in
accordance with the principles of the global Responsible
Care® initiative and the UN Global Compact.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Adequate provisions have been established to secure or

need to adjust environmental provisions identified through

6.5 Process/organization risks

1. General

This risk category covers the interface between risk manage-
ment and the internal control system (ICS). In this category,
risks generally result from specific process shortcomings.
Alongside general weaknesses, these include, in particular,
risks within the ICS and the accounting-related ICS. Classifi-
cation is therefore based on the list of processes drawn up by
Corporate Audit. Starting from key corporate processes, the
existence of relevant control objectives and standard controls
for the main risks identified is checked. In view of the types
of risk in this category, a purely qualitative assessment is
normally used.

The evaluation of specific risks resulting from weaknesses
in processes within the organizational units showed very little
scope to optimize existing processes because of the efficacy
of the current controls. Corresponding scope for improve-
ment has been identified. There are therefore no signs of
systematic errors in the Evonik Group’s ICS.

2. Internal control system for financial accounting
The main financial reporting risks are identified in the ICS
through a quantitative and a qualitative analysis. Controls are
defined for each risk area of the accounting process. Their
efficacy is reviewed at regular intervals and improved where
necessary. All elements of the control process are verified by
Internal Audit on the basis of random samples.

To ensure the quality of financial statements we have a
Group-wide policy which defines uniform accounting and
valuation principles for all German and foreign companies
included in the consolidated financial statements for the
Evonik Group. The majority of companies have delegated the
preparation of their financial statements to Global Financial
Services. Through systematic process orientation, standard-
ization, and the utilization of economies of scale, this lever-
ages sustained cost benefits and also improves the quality of
accounting. Global Financial Services has developed a stan-
dardized control matrix for the internal control system for
financial accounting. This is implemented in the three global

shared service centers: in Offenbach (Germany) for the
Germany region, Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) for the Asia
region, and San Jose (Costa Rica) for the Americas region.
The aim is to ensure a uniform global standard for the internal
control system for financial accounting. In principle, the
annual financial statements of all fully consolidated companies
and all joint operations are audited. In the few exceptions
from this rule, an upfront risk assessment is performed with
the auditor.

All data are consolidated by the Accounting Division using
the SAP SEM-BCS system. Group companies submit their
financial statements via a web-based interface. A range of
technical validations is performed at this stage. Computerized
and manual process controls and checking by a second per-
son are the key oversight functions performed in the financial
reporting process. The preparation of the monthly consoli-
dated income statement and publication of three quarterly
reports allow us to gain experience with new accounting
issues and provide a sound basis for plausibilization of the year-
end accounts. The Executive Board receives monthly reports
and quarterly reports are submitted to the Audit Committee
of the Supervisory Board.

Aspects that may represent opportunities or risks for
financial reporting in the future are identified and evaluated
early through the risk management system. This ensures that
risk management can be closely aligned to controlling and
accounting processes.

7. Report on expected developments

7.1 Economic background

Global economy expected to grow

slightly faster in 2018

We expect global economic conditions in 2018 to be slightly
better than in 2017. Overall, we anticipate slightly stronger
global momentum, with a growth rate of 3.1 percent in 2018,
compared with 3.0 percent in 2017.

We assume that the positive economic trend will continue in
Western and Eastern Europe, albeit with slightly lower
growth than in 2017. This should be supported, among other
things, by continued monetary policy stimulation, a weaker
fiscal policy headwind, and rising confidence among companies
and private households. Nevertheless, the economic develop-
ment could be marred by political risks and risks in the financial
sector.

In North America, the economy should recover further.
Growth will be driven by consumer spending, supported by
falling unemployment and rising domestic incomes and
assets. The US tax reform will reduce the tax burden on com-
panies and private individuals and will provide moderate eco-
nomic impetus through an increase in corporate investment

7.2 Outlook

Basis for our forecast:
Global growth of 3.1 percent
Euro/US dollar exchange rate: US$1.20 (2017: US$1.13)

and private consumption. In the light of increasing inflation,
the Federal Reserve in the USA will continue its cautious
interest rate rises.

Thanks to the economic upturn in Brazil, growth will pick
up further in Central and South America. However, political
uncertainty, high unemployment, and private debt are holding
back a significant improvement in the economic prospects for
this region.

Growth will remain high in the Asia-Pacific region. We
assume that lower growth in investment and lending, plus
environmental policy, will dampen the Chinese economy
slightly in the future. Economic growth in Japan will weaken
slightly compared with the previous year. In India, by contrast,
growth will pick up again following the reform of the cash
system and the introduction of a uniform nationwide value-
added tax.

The projection for the global economy is marked by some
uncertainty. At present, the main risks relate to geopolitical
uncertainty caused by the large number of crises. The global
economy could, however, develop differently from our
expectations, especially as a result of central bank action.
Alongside the as yet unclear impact of the UK’s exit from the
European Union, uncertainty about the United States’ eco-
nomic policy has increased. Furthermore, global growth
could be dampened if the slowdown of the Chinese economy
gathers pace.

In view of the stable development of raw material prices and
exchange rates, we estimate that the rise in global inflation
will be moderate. As of the start of 2018, we expect raw
materials to rise as the markets recover in the second half of
the year. Reasons for this are, on the one hand, the present
development of oil prices and, on the other, the Chinese gov-
ernment's tougher stance on environmental policy. Overall,
we expect prices of Evonik-specific raw materials to be
slightly higher than in 2017. Consequently, we estimate that
in 2018 Evonik’s raw material index will be slightly higher
than in 2017.

Internal raw material cost index slightly higher than in the
prior year

MANAGEMENT REPORT

Report on expected developments
Outlook

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Sales and earnings
We aim to grow sales and earnings again in 2018.

We anticipate that sales will grow slightly in 2018 (2017:
€14.4 billion). Thanks to our strong market positions and
strategic alignment to our four growth engines, we assume
continued high demand for our products and perceptible
volume growth. Selling prices are expected to be stable or
rise slightly in most businesses. Overall, we anticipate a slight
decline at Group level due to the expected development of
the Performance Materials segment.

We also expect that operating earnings will improve
compared with the prior year (€2,360 million). At the same
time, there will be a further structural improvement in our
earnings quality. In addition to higher contributions from our
innovation growth fields, the businesses acquired from Air
Products and Huber will play a considerable part in this. That
will further reduce our dependence on individual products.

Specifically, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between
24 billion and €2.6 billion. The growth in our operating
earnings should be primarily organic. In addition, we assume
positive earnings effects from the full-year consolidation of the
Huber silica business, further synergies from the integration
of the businesses acquired from Air Products and Huber, and a
positive earnings contribution from the efficiency enhancement
program we have launched.

We assume that earnings will continue to develop positively
in the majority of businesses in the Nutrition & Care segment.
Our solutions for sustainable animal nutrition and our inno-
vative products and services for pharmaceuticals, medical
technology, and cosmetics should make a significant contri-
bution to this. As well as organic growth, we expect to leverage
additional positive earnings effects from synergies resulting
from the integration of the Air Products business. The annual
average prices for essential amino acids for animal nutrition
are expected to be stable compared with the prior year. At
the same time, we assume sustained volume growth in this
area. Overall, in the Nutrition & Care segment earnings are
expected to be slightly higher than in the previous year.

We also anticipate that the Resource Efficiency segment
will continue the very successful business performance of
previous years. Further strong volume growth should bring
another perceptible rise in earnings. Our broad portfolio of
high-performance materials for environment-friendly and
energy-efficient system solutions offers the best basis for a

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

continuation of the positive organic earnings trend. In
addition, earnings growth will be boosted by additional earn-
ings from the Huber silica business and synergies from the
integration of the Air Products and Huber businesses.

The Performance Materials segment should get off to a
good start in 2018. In addition to the measures already in
place to raise efficiency, which are increasingly feeding
through to earnings, the continuation of the favorable
supply/demand situation, especially for methacrylates, is
proving beneficial. In the remainder of the year, however, this
segment is unlikely to achieve the good level of 2017. Overall,
earnings in the Performance Materials segment will not
achieve the prior-year level.

The earnings impact of slightly higher raw material prices
may affect the various businesses differently, but should
balance out across the portfolio as a whole, partly through
our ability to recoup most of the rises through selling prices.

In 2018, the return on capital employed (ROCE) should again
be above the cost of capital (10.0 percent before taxes) and will
probably be around the prior-year level (2017: 11.2 percent).

Financing and investments

We expect capital expenditures to be around €1 billion in
2018. We have set ourselves a goal of keeping total capital
expenditures below the prior-year level (2017: €1.1 billion),
even though investment in our world-scale plant for feed
additives in Singapore will double compared with 2017 to
around €300 million. Our strict capital discipline and clear
focus on our four growth engines will contribute to this.

Alongside the expected earnings growth and increased
cost-awareness, our strict capital discipline will also result in
a slight increase in the free cash flow (2017: €511 million).

Occupational and plant safety

We assume that the accident frequency’ indicator will be
stable in 2018 (2017: 1.16) and expect it to be below the
upper limit of 1.30 defined for 2018. Our long-term goal is
still a sustained value of less than 1.00. We anticipate that we
can achieve a slight improvement in our plant safety indicator,
incident frequency? (2017: 1.11), and that it will remain below
the upper limit of 1.10.

1 Number of accidents involving Evonik employees and contractors’ employees under Evonik's direct supervision per 1 million working hours.

2 Number of incidents per 1 million working hours.
