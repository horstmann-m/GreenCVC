GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

No changes were made to the Group's reporting entity or the structure of its consolidated financial state-
ments in fiscal year 2015/16.

Markets

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has operations all over the world. With its headquarters in Jena (Germany) and
additional plants and subsidiaries in Germany, France, Spain, the USA and Japan, the Company has a direct
presence in the world’s most important medical technology markets. In addition, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group
utilizes the strong global sales network of the ZEISS Group, with more than 50 sales and service locations,
thus ensuring itself customer proximity and a crucial advantage over international rivals. Aside from its own
research and development locations, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group also has access to the expertise of the
ZEISS Group. Of the around 25 research and development locations of the ZEISS Group worldwide, in particu-
lar China and India are important research centers for the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group. They offer the possibility
of working with the customers on site, in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the market and
develop specific products that are tailored to market requirements.

Organization and business activity

A distinction is made within the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group essentially between two main areas in which the
Company operates: Ophthalmology and Microsurgery. Up until 31 July 2016, the operative business was
divided into three strategic business units (SBUs). In addition to Microsurgery (MSC), there were two strategic
business units within Ophthalmology: Ophthalmic Systems (OPH) and Surgical Ophthalmology (SUR).

The organizational structure was modified on 1 August 2016. Two of the former three strategic business
units, the SBU OPH and the SBU SUR, were combined to form a new Ophthalmic Devices SBU, which com-
prises the entire ophthalmic business. A distinction shall be made from now on between the two strategic
business units Ophthalmic Devices (OPT) and Microsurgery (MCS), in which the operational business is
condensed according to similar application areas and customer groups. The objective of this organizational
change was to establish uniform management of the ophthalmic business as a whole and to strengthen the
focus on customers and consolidate the range of integrated solutions from a single source.

Ophthalmic Devices

In ophthalmology, a distinction is made between conditions such as vision defects (refraction), cataracts,
glaucoma and other retinal disorders, the incidence of which particularly increases with age and can become
chronic in many cases.

In the Ophthalmic Devices SBU, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group offers a comprehensive portfolio of products
and solutions for the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases, as well as systems and consumables for cata-
ract, retinal and refractive surgery. The Company's aim is to enable efficient diagnosis and treatment through
integrated products and systems that are geared to the procedures of the attending physician. Customers
here are both practicing ophthalmologists and optometrists, as well as physicians and surgeons in hospitals
and outpatient surgery centers.

In the area of ophthalmic diagnostics, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group offers a comprehensive range of products
for investigating all clinical pictures. Examples include optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices, perimetry
devices and tonometers for measuring intraocular pressure for glaucoma diagnostics. The Company offers
end-to-end solutions for the surgical treatment of eye diseases in the area of cataract and retinal surgery,
including a comprehensive selection of intraocular lenses (IOLs) and consumables. The offering in the preop-
erative area for cataract treatment includes optical biometers. In the operating room, the Company supports

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

cataract surgery with ophthalmic surgical microscopes, an OR-assistance system and phacoemulsification/
vitrectomy devices. The broadly diversified portfolio of microincision-capable intraocular lenses extends from
the standard (monofocal lenses) to the premium segment (for example toric multifocal lenses) and is supple-
mented by ophthalmic viscoelastics. The OR workstation is further completed by software-based assistance
systems such as CALLISTO eye®, to assist with the implantation of toric intraocular lenses. The Company aims
to deliver value-added to the customer by providing interconnected systems that are precisely tailored to

the surgeon's workflow. One example of this is the ZEISS Cataract Suite markerless, with which the Company
offers the surgeon a complete, one-stop range of devices for cataract surgery. The product portfolio in the
area of refractive surgery primarily includes systems and consumables for minimally invasive refractive surgery.

A further focus is the networking of systems and the integrated management of data, to make workflows in
hospitals and medical practices efficient. For this purpose FORUM®, a scalable and flexible data management
system, offers a comprehensive, cross-location solution for the evaluation of clinically relevant data from
various diagnostic devices and direct access to the full examination history of the patient.

Microsurgery

In the Microsurgery strategic business unit the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group provides visualization solutions for
minimally invasive surgical treatments. The state-of-the-art surgical microscopes for neurosurgery, ear, nose
and throat (ENT), plastic and reconstructive (P & R) surgery, as well as dental surgery and spinal surgery,

are essential tools, for example in the surgical treatment of tumors or vascular diseases, such as aneurysms.
Innovative add-on functions, such as cutting-edge video technology, three-dimensional imaging or intraoper-
ative fluorescence options, offer the surgeon assistance in complex treatments, by delivering diagnostic data
and information during the procedure in the eyepiece or on screens. In surgical oncology, the innovative
radiation device INTRABEAM® enables the Company to offer patients a gentle, intraoperative treatment
option for certain types of tumors.

Group strategy

It is the strategy of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group to achieve sustainable, profitable growth as market and
technology leader in the field of ophthalmology and microsurgery. The product range is aimed at improving
the treatment result and reducing treatment costs through efficient and effective approaches. The success
factors are: customer focus, innovation and integrated solutions for diagnosis and treatment.

Customer focus

The customers of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group are facing major challenges in managing rising case numbers,
limited public funding and more demanding expectations of patients with respect to the treatment outcome.
Integrated products and solutions can help customers to increase workflow efficiency and reduce costs, for
example by providing clinical decision aids for the physician and options for easy outsourcing of routine tasks
to medical auxiliary staff. Digitization offers us massive opportunities in this respect, for example in the field
of data management solutions. A key prerequisite for the long-term success of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group
is having a deep understanding of the customers’ challenges and a service offering that is tailored to meeting
these challenges.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Innovation

One of the goals is to make cutting-edge technology in medical application accessible for customers. The
Group is therefore striving to establish its products as new gold standards in medical diagnostics and therapy.
The Group ensures technology leadership by cooperating closely with its customers and by continuing to
invest heavily in research and development (R&D).

Integrated solutions

Given the multitude of diagnostic and therapeutic devices typically used in medical practices and clinics,
customers are offered the opportunity to make their workflows more efficient, and to achieve better clinical
outcomes, by logically networking their devices and systems. Comprehensive system integration, including
\T-assisted analysis functions, is a key prerequisite for this.

Corporate governance

The central governing bodies within the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group are the Management Board and the
Executive Committee newly created as part of the organizational change on 1 August 2016. This Executive
Committee is made up of the members of the Management Board of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG and the heads
of the two strategic business units, Ophthalmic Devices and Microsurgery. The management levels below the
Executive Committee perform their management responsibilities in accordance with the organizational struc-
ture within the strategic business units across regions and company locations. Cross-organizational functions
such as, for example, Group Finance, Group Communications or Human Resources are managed centrally.
The strategies and projects are implemented locally at the regional companies themselves in accordance with
prevailing laws and legislation, rules of procedure and articles of association, as well as the corporate values
and principles applied globally within the Group.

As a company of the ZEISS Group, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is also subject to the globally applicable Code
of Conduct, which defines the basic principles of good and fair conduct in the competitive environment and
in dealing with our employees and customers, and according to which business is carried out worldwide. This
Code of Conduct sets out the fundamental ethical principles of good conduct and values which govern the
actions of both management and employees in their day-to-day work at the Company.

Corporate management

The aim of corporate management is to achieve a long-term increase in value by consistently implementing
the strategy. The tools for the financial management of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group comprise a comprehen-
sive system of key performance indicators. The greatest importance is attached to Economic Value Added®
("EVA®")!, Free Cash Flow (FCF)’ the EBIT margin and revenue growth. These control ratios define the balance
between growth, profitability and financial power, upon which sustainable growth of the Company is built.
These are supplemented by strategic measures and projects in the areas of customer excellence, people/per-
formance culture and operational excellence.

' Calculation: EVA® = operating result after taxes minus capital costs of €43.5m for 2015/16 (calculation of capital costs: average committed
business assets 2015/16 (€524.6m) multiplied by capital cost rate 2015/16 (8.3%)

? Calculation Free Cash Flow: FCF = EBIT +/- changes in trade receivables +/- changes in inventories, including advance payments +/- changes
in provisions (excluding provisions for pensions and tax provisions) +/- changes in current accrued liabilities +/- changes in trade payables +
advance payments received — increase in investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets + write down of investments in
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

BUSINESS REPORT
Underlying conditions for business development

Macroeconomic environment®

During the reporting period, the global economy grew at a significantly slower rate than forecast. The rapidly
developing economies in Asia, such as India and China, continued to grow at above-average rates, although
growth in China cooled considerably. The markets in Latin America did not develop uniformly; a significant
recession in Brazil offset moderate growth in Mexico. Market growth in the industrialized countries was mod-
erate in fiscal year 2015/16, but was weaker than expected. The upturn in the U.S. and Japan was consider-
ably smaller than expected; market growth in the eurozone was as expected.

Uncertainties in the markets, particularly in China and Brazil, low oil prices, uncertainty due to Brexit, the
situation in the Middle East and ongoing structural problems, were major political and economic issues,
which impacted negatively on investment activity in industry and the public sector.

Situation in the medical technology industry

The Company believes that medical technology is one of the fast-growing sectors in the medium to long
term. Growth drivers are medical progress and megatrends, such as the demographic trend due to increas-
ing life expectancy and population growth. While a rising per-capita income is increasing demand for basic
healthcare in rapidly developing economies, people in western regions are increasingly willing to pay more
for better-quality services. As a result, the Company assumes that the total number of patients suffering from
age-related illnesses will continuously rise. At the same time, it is expected that there will be a growing need
for comprehensive and high-quality health care.

In the traditional markets of western industrialized nations the Company assumes that the demand for medical
technology innovations and a higher quality of treatment will continue to rise as a result of higher and higher
consumer and patient demands, due to a growing tendency to use premium services as a self-paying patient
At the same time, the cost pressure in the health care systems is increasing price pressure. In addition, tighter
regulations and varying regulatory requirements regionally is a growing challenge with regard to product
development and approval

Equally high are the demands on manufacturers to offer products and solutions that increase the efficiency of
workflows for customers and that offer effective treatment methods to patients.

The demand for health care goods and services in the rapidly developing economies (RDEs) also creates
significant future growth potential for the medical technology sector, due to the rising per capita income and
growing prosperity in these countries. Increases in the volumes of conventional medical technology and basic
health care products, in particular, shall play an increasingly more important role here, due to improvements
in the standard of living.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

It can be assumed that the demand for diagnostic and therapeutic devices and systems will continue to grow
in the long term, both in microsurgery and in ophthalmology, as well as implants and consumables.

a) Market for ophthalmic products

The market for ophthalmic products in the broader sense includes devices and systems for the diagnosis,
treatment and post-treatment of eye diseases, implants for ophthalmic surgery and ophthalmic pharmaceu-
ticals, contact lenses, contact lens care products, consumables — with the exception of glasses and glasses
frames. According to the Company's estimates, the market had a global volume of around US$36.7b
(about €31.9b) in 2015*. The Group's product range includes devices and systems, implants, consumables
and instruments for ophthalmology and ophthalmic surgery. According to the Group's estimates, these
sub-markets had a volume of around US$9.8b, or around €8.5b%, in 2015.

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group estimates its share of the "devices and systems for ophthalmology" market seg-
ment, traditionally served by the Company, at about US$3.2b or €2.8b* or about 20% in 2015. In the market
segment "implants, consumables and instruments for ophthalmic surgery", the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group
estimates its global market share in 2015 at about 5%. However, our regional market shares in the countries
the Company is currently focusing on range between 5% and 30%.

As described in the section "Situation in the medical technology industry", the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's
medium-term forecast is further long-term growth in the market for ophthalmic products, regardless of annual
fluctuations.

Based on the information at hand, the Group estimates that it slightly increased its market share overall in the
market segments it addresses, in comparison with the prior year.

b) Market for microsurgery products

Besides ophthalmology, the Company also operates in the market for microsurgery, particularly in the field of
neuro/ENT surgery. The overall neuro/ENT surgery market is divided into three market segments: "Implants",
"Surgical instruments" and "Visualization". In the "Visualization" market segment served by the Company

a distinction can be made between the sub-segments "Surgical Microscopes" and "Other Visualization".
According to the Group's estimates, this market segment had a total volume of around US$1.6b or €1.4b*,
in 2015. With a market share that it estimates to be almost 20%, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is therefore
one of the largest providers in this segment. According to own estimates, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group
continues to be the global market leader in the sub-segment "Surgical microscopes", with a market share of
more than 50%

As described in the section "Situation in the medical technology industry", the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's

medium-term forecast is further long-term growth in the market for microsurgery products, regardless of
annual fluctuations.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Overall assertion on the financial position of the Group at the end of the fiscal year

With revenue of €1,088.4m and growth of 4.6%, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group achieved the forecast range
of €1,080m to €1,120m for fiscal year 2015/16. Boosted by positive currency effects, the Ophthalmology
sector and the Asia/Pacific region (APAC), in particular, contributed to this development of business.

Primarily driven by the positive development in the refractive laser business, the SBU Ophthalmic Systems
showed growth of 7.5%, and thus slightly exceeded the expectations of a low to mid-single-digit percentage
growth, while currency effects also had a slightly positive effect. Nevertheless, the situation in Ophthalmic
Diagnostics remains tense due to the strong competitive pressure. This is counteracted with corresponding
initiatives in terms of product innovations, sales measures and cost reductions.

Overall, the market for products of the Surgical Ophthalmology SBU was slightly weaker than expected.
Growth in the Surgical Ophthalmology SBU was accordingly slightly lower compared with the prior year, at
4.3%, but was in line with the forecast of an increase within at least the mid-single-digit percentage range.
The SBU nevertheless grew faster than the corresponding market as a whole and further strengthened its
competitive position, particularly in the area of intraocular lenses, which recorded a double-digit percentage
increase.

The growth of the Ophthalmic Systems SBU and the Surgical Ophthalmology SBU amounted to total growth
of 6.0% for the newly created strategic business unit, Ophthalmic Devices. Currency effects had a positive
impact on growth of this segment. Adjusted for currency effects, revenue increased by 4.1%.

Growth momentum in the market environment of the Microsurgery SBU remained slow during the year. The
strategic business unit nevertheless retained its leading market position, as expected, and achieved revenue
growth in the low single-digit percentage range (1.3%).

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) increased to €154.3m. Relative to revenue, the Group achieved an
EBIT margin of 14.2% (prior year: 12.6%) which was therefore within the range of 13% to 15% forecast for
both fiscal year 2015/16 and the medium term. The significant increase in the EBIT margin is attributable to
a strict cost discipline and a more favorable product mix with a higher proportion of case-number-dependent
revenue.

The EBIT margin in the Ophthalmic Systems SBU improved significantly, particularly as a result of the positive
development in the field of refractive lasers, but was slightly below the group average, as expected. The
Surgical Ophthalmology SBU achieved significant margin growth due to strict cost management and growth-
related economies of scale, and was slightly higher than the Group average for the fiscal year as a whole.
Accordingly, the development of the EBIT margin within the newly created Ophthalmic Devices SBU was
positive overall. The EBIT margin of the Microsurgery SBU increased only slightly compared with the prior
year, due, among other things, to higher research and development costs, and somewhat restrained revenue
growth, but remained above the Group average, as expected.

At €111.8m in fiscal year 2015/16, the Group's cash flow from operating activities is significantly higher than
in the prior year (prior year: €56.7m).

Free cash flow increased to €146.0m (prior year: €91.1m). EVA rose to €64.7m, compared with €42.0m in
the prior year.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

In order to maintain its innovative strength and ensure future growth, the Company has up to now invested
around 10% to 11% of its revenue each year in research and development, as budgeted. In the past fiscal
year R&D spending amounted to 11.3% of revenue.

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's financial position remained stable. This is also contributing towards the
achievement of the Company's objectives, which are geared to sustainable growth, and gives the Group

additional stability.

Revenue

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group increased its revenue by 4.6% to €1,088.4m (prior year: €1,040.1m) in fiscal
year 2015/16, and thus achieved the forecast range proposed in May 2016 of €1,080m to €1,120m. The
Group benefited from positive currency effects. After adjustment for currency effects, growth amounted to
2.7%. In particular the area of Ophthalmology and the APAC region contributed to this growth.

2014/15 1,040,061/14.4%
2013/14 909,255/0.3%

a) Consolidated revenue by strategic business unit

Since the merging of the two former strategic business units Ophthalmic Systems and Surgical Ophthalmolo-
gy on 1 August 2016, almost three-quarters of Group revenue has been generated in the newly established
Ophthalmic Devices strategic business unit (72.8%; prior year: 71.9%). The Microsurgery strategic business
unit accounted for 27.2% (prior year: 28.1%) of consolidated revenue. In the reporting year, 38.7%

(prior year: 37.7%) of total revenue was attributable to the strategic business unit Ophthalmic Systems and
34.1% (prior year: 34.2%) to Surgical Ophthalmology.

Share of strategic business units in consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2015/16

Ophthalmic Devices 72.8%

Microsurgery 27.2%

The revenue growth of the new Ophthalmic Devices strategic business unit amounted to 6.0% for fiscal year
2015/16 (adjusted for currency effects: 4.1%). Revenue amounted to €791.9m (prior year: €747.2m).

The refractive laser business once again proved to be the growth driver, benefiting in particular from high
procedure-dependent revenue. The segment for devices and systems for diagnosis continued to be exposed
to intense competitive and price pressure during the year. Measures aimed at improving the competitiveness
continued in the past fiscal year. Business with intraocular lenses and consumables for cataract surgery and

biometry developed positively, whereas the business with ophthalmic surgery microscopes moved sideways,
after strong demand in the prior year.

Revenue of the Ophthalmic Systems strategic business unit increased by 7.5%, from €392.0m to €421.2m.
Assuming constant exchange rates, revenue grew by 5.2%.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

In the former Surgical Ophthalmology strategic business unit, revenue increased from €355.3m to €370.7m
This corresponds to growth of 4.3% (adjusted for currency effects: 2.9%).

There was a slight downturn in business of -0.9% in the Microsurgery strategic business unit, after adjust-

ment for currency effects. Business in Japan, in particular, was restrained. Boosted by currency effects, the
SBU grew slightly, by 1.3%.

b) Consolidated revenue by region

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has a very balanced range of business activities worldwide, with each of its
three business regions generating around one third of its total revenue. In the past fiscal year, the region
Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) accounted for 32.4% (prior year: 34.5%) of consolidated revenue.
The Americas and Asia/Pacific (APAC) regions accounted for 32.5% (prior year: 34.8%) and 35.1% (prior
year: 30.7%), respectively, of the Group's total revenue. The APAC region provided the highest contribution
to revenue for the first time and also achieved the highest revenue growth of 19.5% (adjusted for currency
effects: 15.5%).

Share of regions in consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2015/16

EMEA 32.4%

Revenue in the EMEA region fell by a slight -1.7%, or -1.3% after adjustment for currency effects, from
€358.8m in the prior year to €352.7m. Business in individual markets was very heterogeneous, however.
Germany, France and the United Kingdom made good contributions to revenue, while declines were recorded
particularly in Southern Europe and the Middle East.

Business in the Americas region declined by -2.2%, or -4.9% after adjustment for currency effects. Revenue

amounted to €354.0m (prior year: €361.9m). This was mainly attributable to declining revenue in Ophthalmic
Diagnostics due to persistently intense competitive pressure.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

The APAC region made a substantial contribution to growth within the Group, increasing its revenue by
19.5%, to €381.7m (prior year: €319.4m). Adjusted for currency effects, growth was of a similar magnitude
of 15.5%, with China, Southeast Asia and South Korea as the strongest growth drivers.

Gross profit

In fiscal year 2015/16, gross profit increased from €539.7m to €579.6m. The gross margin for the reporting
period increased to 53.2% (prior year: 51.9%). This growth is mainly due to the positive effect had by a more
favorable product mix with a higher proportion of case-number-dependent business, particularly in Ophthal-
mology.

Functional costs

Functional costs for the reporting year amounted to €425.2m (prior year: €409.1m), thus increasing by 3.9%,
which is slightly disproportionate to revenue growth. The proportion of revenue decreased slightly year-on-
year, from 39.3% to 39.1%.

» Selling and marketing expenses: Selling and marketing expenses increased disproportionately to revenue
growth in the fiscal year under review, by 3.0%, from €247.9m to €255.3m. Relative to revenue, selling and
marketing expenses were slightly below the prior year's level, at 23.5% (prior year: 23.8%).

» General administrative expenses: Expenses in this area decreased by 5.5%, to €46.5m (prior year: €49.2m).
The ratio of these expenses to revenue decreased from 4.7% in the prior year, to 4.3%.

» Research and development expenses: The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group continuously invests in R&D, in order
to further develop its product portfolio and ensure further growth. R&D expenses increased by 10.2% in the
reporting period, to €123.4m (prior year: €112.0m). At 11.3% of revenue, the R&D ratio increased slightly
year-on-year (prior year: 10.8%).

Development of earnings

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group uses earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT = operating result) as a key perfor-
mance indicator. EBIT for the reporting period amounted to €154.3m (prior year: €130.6m). This corresponds
to an EBIT margin of 14.2% (prior year: 12.6%). The significant increase in the EBIT margin is attributable to
a strict cost discipline and a more favorable product mix with a higher proportion of case-number-dependent
revenue.

Accordingly, the development of the EBIT margin within the newly created Ophthalmic Devices SBU was
positive. This is attributable, among other things, to a more favorable product mix, which primarily resulted
from a higher amount of procedure-dependent revenue in the refractive laser business, operating economies
of scale, as well as cost-cutting measures accompanied by a strict cost discipline. The EBIT margin of the for-
mer Ophthalmic Systems SBU improved significantly compared with the prior year. Substantial increases in the
EBIT margin were recorded in the former Surgical Ophthalmology SBU. The EBIT margin of the Microsurgery
SBU increased only slightly compared with the prior year, due, among other things, to higher research and
development expenses and the somewhat restrained revenue growth

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) amounted to €174.6m in the past
fiscal year (prior year: €149.8m), resulting in an EBITDA margin of 16.0% (prior year: 14.4%)

The balance of interest income and interest expenses amounted to €-1.1m in the reporting period
(prior year: €-0.2m).

Due to the recognition of currency hedges as of 30 September 2016, the financial result was impacted by
foreign currency losses in the amount of €9.3m (prior year: foreign currency losses of €8.9m).

The tax rate for the reporting period was 29.6% (prior year: 35.5%). In the prior year, the financial result
was still impacted by write-downs in connection with the impairment testing of the investments in Oraya
Therapeutics Inc. As a general rule, an average annual tax rate of between 31% and 33% is assumed.

5 Write-downs on intangible assets arose from the purchase price allocation (PPA), mainly in connection with the acquisition of
Aaren Scientific Inc. in fiscal year 2013/14.
© Restructuring costs mainly relate to the reorganization of the Diagnostics unit within the Ophthalmic Devices strategic business unit.

Financial position

Objectives and principles of financial management

A primary objective of financial management at the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is to ensure the solvency of the
Company and to manage this efficiently throughout the Group. The Group's main source of liquidity comes
from the business operations of the individual business units, upon which the financial activities and the
strategic orientation of the Group are also based. The Company therefore operates a global financial manage-
ment system that encompasses all of its subsidiaries and is centrally organized at Group level. The Company
also strives to continuously improve its financial power and reduce financial risks by keeping a constant check
on the solvency of its debtors, which also involves the use of financial instruments.

The Company deposits any liquidity it does not require at normal market conditions with the Group treasury
of Carl Zeiss AG. When investing surplus liquidity, short-term availability mainly comes before the goal of
maximizing earnings, so that funds can be accessed quickly if, for example, acquisition opportunities arise.
The Group has production plants in the USA and Europe. This minimizes the effect of currency fluctuation
The remaining currency risk is hedged by simple futures trading. Details on this can be found in the notes

to the consolidated financial statements under "(2) (i) Financial instruments", "(27) Additional disclosures on
financial instruments", "(35) Financial risk management", "(2) (u)" and "(33) Related party disclosures" and
in the financial statements of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG in sections 5 "Information and explanatory notes on
accounting and valuation principles", paragraph "Derivative financial instruments"”, 9 "Receivables from/

liabilities to affiliated companies" and 26 "Financial result".

Financial management
The ratio of borrowed capital to equity amounts to 46.6% as of 30 September 2016
(30 September 2015: 42.9%).

The Group's dynamic gearing ratio stands at 0.3’ years for fiscal year 2015/16 (prior year: 2.4 years®).

The interest coverage ratio, i.e., the coverage of interest income by the operating result before depreciation
and amortization (EBITDA), amounted to 69.4 (prior year: 101.5).

Cash inflows generated from operating activities provide an important source of financing for the Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group. The Company can also create additional liquidity by issuing new shares on the capital market.
Furthermore, the Company has the option to assume loans either from the Group treasury of Carl Zeiss AG or
from banks.

For further information on the financial liabilities of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group please refer to note "(24)

Non-current financial liabilities", "(25) Current accrued liabilities" and "(26) Other current non-financial liabil-
ities" in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the financial statements of

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Since the Group possesses sufficient cash funds to finance its operating and strategic objectives, changes in
credit conditions do not currently have any material effect on its financial position.

Separate reporting on financial instruments

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is exposed to currency fluctuation risks, due to its international business activi-
ties in numerous different currencies. Significant currency risks are hedged against with hedging transactions,
based on a rolling business plan.

Hedges are mainly transacted centrally by Carl Zeiss Financial Services GmbH. The services provided by

Carl Zeiss Financial Services GmbH to Carl Zeiss Meditec AG and its subsidiaries are regulated by correspond-
ing general agreements. The hedges are processed by Carl Zeiss Financial Services GmbH with external
business banks. Hedges are processed exclusively by banks with a high credit rating from leading agencies.
The business transactions are executed with strict separation of functions between the front office (trade),
middle office (financial risk management, controlling) and back office (processing, documentation).

Value-at-risk analyses, together with scenario, sensitivity and stress test analyses, are implemented in risk
control and monitoring, to quantify the currency risks. Hedging rates are specified for operative control of all
relevant currencies. In addition, limits were defined to limit risks relating to contracting parties and transaction
types. Derivative financial instruments are not used for speculative purposes.

Statement of cash flows

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's statement of cash flows shows the origin and utilization of the cash flows
within a fiscal year. A distinction is made between cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from
investing and financing activities.

Changes in individual items in the income statement and the statement of financial position are recorded in
the statement of cash flows. In contrast, the consolidated statement of financial position presents the figures
as they stood at the end of the reporting period on 30 September 2016. As a result, the statements in the
analysis of the financial position may differ from the presentation of net assets based on the consolidated
statement of financial position.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Cash flows from operating activities amounted to €111.8m in the reporting period (prior year: €56.7m).
This increase is primarily due to the higher consolidated profit, which is around €34m higher than the prior
year. In addition, there was a less build-up of trade receivables at the end of the reporting period in fiscal year
2015/16 than in the prior year.

Cash flow from investing activities amounted to €77.3m in the period under review (prior year: €-35.2m).
This amount is mainly due to the maturity of a fixed-term deposit on 30 September 2015, in the amount of
€110m, which was processed via Carl Zeiss Financial Services GmbH.

Cash flow from financing activities in the past fiscal year amounts to €-195.0m (prior year: €-19.3m). The
difference compared with the year-ago period is primarily attributable to an increase in treasury receivables,
resulting, among other, from the maturity of the above-mentioned fixed-term deposit of €110m.

Free cash flow increased, primarily as a result of the higher cash flows from operating activities, to €146.0m
(prior year: €91.1m)

Investment and depreciation policy

In order to further consolidate the good market position in the medical technology sector and strengthen
our leading market position, the Company needs to make continued investments. A distinction is made here
between two types of investment: capacity expansions and replacement investments. These investments are
primarily financed from cash flow from operating activities.

In terms of the production of devices and systems, the Company mainly confines itself to the integration of
individual components to create system solutions. For this reason, investments in property plant and equip-
ment are comparatively low. One exception, however, is the production of intraocular lenses, which generally
demands higher investments due to a larger vertical range of manufacture.

Nevertheless, the required investment of capital in real assets is limited within the Group, which is evident
from the development of the capex ratio — the ratio of total investments? in property, plant and equipment
(cash) to consolidated revenue. In fiscal year 2015/16 this ratio was 1.2% (prior year: 1.0%).

At Carl Zeiss Meditec AG and its subsidiaries intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are subject
to scheduled, straight-line amortization and depreciation, respectively, over their estimated useful lives.
Further details on this can be found in note "(2) (g) Other intangible assets" and "(2) (h) Property, plant and
equipment" in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and in section 6 "Fixed
assets" of the financial statements of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG.

In fiscal year 2015/16, investments in property, plant and equipment (cash) totaled €12.8m, compared with €9.8m the prior year.

NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Responsibility

For Carl Zeiss Meditec Group a particular commitment to public welfare and the environment has traditionally
played an important role. The Company wants to give as many people as possible access to modern medical
care and contribute to the improvement of medical care for people in all regions of the world. It also goes
without saying that the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group believes in responsible and state-of-the-art handling of
natural resources.

Employees
Highly qualified and motivated employees are a necessity for ensuring the long-term success of a company.

Responsible human resources development and continuous improvement play a crucial role in this. As of
30 September, 2016 the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group had 2,910 employees worldwide (prior year: 2,888).

It is the Company’s employees, with their expertise and achievements, who lay the foundations for the

Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's global success. That is why the sustainable development and targeted support
of the potential of all employees is the primary task of human resources management at the Company.

The focus is on employee training and management development. To this end, the Company invested more
than half a million euros in Germany alone and employed 15 trainees in Germany in fiscal year 2015/16.
Employees can choose from a wide range of courses offered in the internal ZEISS qualification program. In
addition, ZEISS supports measures for vocational training and qualification opportunities outside working
hours. The Company considers this a sound basis for ensuring long-term economic success. The Group aims
to increase its attractiveness as an employer through strategic employee development.

Social commitment

Social responsibility is an integral part of corporate culture. Our aim is to give people in underprivileged
regions (for example, RDEs) access to state-of-the-art medical care. For this reason, the Company supports
many local social initiatives and dedicates itself to training and further education for physicians and medical
staff, scientific and technological research and sustainable work worldwide. One focus is the global commit-
ment to good vision as part of the VISION 2020 initiative. One special partner is the Christoffel Blindenmission
(CBM). As a partner of the International Council of Ophthalmology (ICO), the Company supports the ICO
Fellowship Program and the "Teaching the Teacher" program. The fellowship program aims to support partic-
ularly talented young ophthalmologists from economically poorer regions.

Environment

It goes without saying that the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group believes in responsible and state-of-the-art handling
of natural resources

All the major manufacturing sites worldwide are certified to the international environmental management
standard ISO 14001. Since December 2015, the Group has been certified in accordance with the internation-
ally recognized energy management standard ISO 50001 in the European Union

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Good examples of sustainable and careful handling of resources and the environment are a company building
in Oberkochen that is particularly sustainable to run, and the more than 4,000 solar panels on the roof of
Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc. in Dublin (California)

In December 2014 the company building in Oberkochen became the first building to be certified by the
German Sustainable Building Council (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Nachhaltiges Bauen e.V., DGNB) in the category
"Administrative and Production Building" and awarded the gold seal. The new building was ranked among the
top ten of all buildings built in Germany and certified by the DGNB

Since 2012 more than 4,000 solar panels on the roof of Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc. in Dublin have been convert-
ing solar energy into around 1.7 million kilowatt hours of electricity per year, thus ensuring that the location
produces the majority of the power it requires itself.

Compliance

As a company of the ZEISS Group, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is also subject to the globally applicable Code
of Conduct, which defines the basic principles of good and fair conduct in the competitive environment and
in dealing with our employees and customers, and according to which business is carried out worldwide. This
Code of Conduct sets out the fundamental ethical principles of good conduct and values which govern the
actions of both management and employees in their day-to-day work at the Company.

Production

Production plants

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group manufactures its products in Jena, Oberkochen and Berlin in Germany, Dublin
and Ontario in the USA and in La Rochelle in France. The Group also has a number of smaller sites belonging
to subsidiaries of Carl Zeiss Meditec S.A.S. in Besancon (France), Livingston (Scotland) and Mauritius. Systems
and devices for ophthalmology are manufactured in Dublin and in Jena. The Group manufactures surgical
microscopes and microsurgical visualization solutions in Oberkochen; intraocular lenses are mainly manufac-
tured in La Rochelle and Berlin, and Ontario. The broad product portfolio is rounded off by viscoelastics,
which are produced at the facility in Livingston and are mainly used for treating cataracts. The two remain-
ing production facilities of Carl Zeiss Meditec S.A.S. manufacture other instruments and consumables for the
treatment of ophthalmic diseases.

Production concept

When manufacturing its devices and systems, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group focuses on the assembly of system
components, most of which it purchases from external suppliers. The vertical range of manufacture for intra-
ocular lenses (IOL) is higher, however. Production of these largely takes place in-house at the Company. Only
a number of specific steps in the production process are outsourced to external companies. When selecting
suppliers, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group continuously strives to qualify additional suppliers for key components
and vendor parts, as appropriate, in order to reduce its dependence on individual suppliers.

The main focus concerning production processes is to be able to respond quickly to customer inquiries and re-
quirements, to implement short chains of command and to be able to quickly and efficiently carry innovations
over into production. Shorter throughput times play a major role in this, as well as reducing inventories, while
simultaneously optimizing production costs, and improving product quality.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Production planning

Production planning in Jena, Oberkochen and Dublin is based on the rolling forecast method, mostly on a
monthly or quarterly basis. The sales forecast is then translated into a demand forecast for production units,
taking inventory changes into account. In order to keep stocks to a minimum, products are usually assembled
to customer order (series production of individual items).

In the area of refractive lasers, inventories are kept for consumables for the planned sales volume for three
months, in order to ensure uninterrupted supplies for customers who cannot use their equipment without
such consumables. The customers are served from the safety stock according to the first-in-first-out principle.

The rolling forecast method described above is also applied for the manufacture of intraocular lenses.
Limited quantities of the finished products are stockpiled since customers expect very short delivery times for
implants. To this end replenishment orders are forwarded by the customers to a central warehouse; these, in
turn, trigger a new order thus ensuring customers are served as quickly as possible. The Carl Zeiss Meditec
Group also operates consignment warehouses in clinics and hospitals, which — depending on consumption —
are continuously restocked

Research and development

Objectives and focus of research and development

Research and development plays an important role within the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group. Pursuant to its strategy,
innovations are a key driver of future growth. The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has the necessary resources to
ensure the Company's future earnings power through its research and development activities. The Company
shall therefore continue to offer innovations in future that make leading technologies available to its custom-
ers, enable improvements in efficiency and continuously enhance treatment results for patients.

For this reason the Company is aiming to continuously expand its product portfolio and continuously improve
products that are already on the market. The Group is therefore striving to establish its products as new

gold standards in medical diagnostics and therapy. The focus is to design more efficient workflows for the
customer by integrating solutions and thus to improve clinical results. A central component of the research
and development work within the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is close cooperation with the customer and con-
tinuously high investments in research and development.

In fiscal year 2015/16 research and development expenses increased by 10.2% to €123.4m (prior year: €112.0m).

At the same time, the F&E ratio increased year-on-year to 11.3% (prior year: 10.8%) and is thus slightly above
the medium to long term target range of 10% to 11%

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

In the reporting period 15.2% (prior year: 14.6%) of the entire workforce of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group
were employed in Research and Development. To a certain extent in research and development, services are
procured from Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, and its subsidiaries. In fiscal year 2015/16 the expenses incurred
for this amounted to around 16.6% of the overall research and development expenses of €123.4m.

Focus of research and development activities in the reporting period
Research and development at the Company mainly focuses on

» examining new technological concepts in terms of their clinical relevance and effectiveness

» the continuous development of the existing product portfolio

» the development of new products and product platforms based on the available basic technologies and

» networking systems and equipment to increase the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment and to improve
treatment results for patients.

Customer focus

The close cooperation with our customers is a key prerequisite for the long-term success of the Company.
The customers are facing challenges in managing rising case numbers, limited public funding and more
demanding expectations of patients with respect to the treatment outcome. On the other hand, ensuring
basic medical care for a large number of people over long distances plays an important role in RDEs. The
different requirements for products and solutions are critical

By driving innovations, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is constantly seeking to make cutting-edge technology
in medical applications accessible for customers and to establish new standards in medical diagnostics and
therapy. At the same time, customers shall be supported in their decision making by integrating data from
different devices using software or by viewing data from different visits during the course of treatment.
Examples of software designed for workflow efficiency are the workplaces used in ophthalmology, such as
the ZEISS Retina Workplace which provides easy access to important clinical information in the management
of macular diseases. In addition, technologies such as fluorescence technology and other imaging techniques
should enable physicians to make better clinical decisions in diagnostic examinations and surgical treatments.
The ZEISS AngioPlex™ OCT Angiography technology enables physicians to examine changes in the retinal
blood vessels non-invasively, using three-dimensional images. In neurosurgery, blood flow can be made visible
using fluorescence technology, to help the physician make decisions during surgery and reduce risks for the
patient.

As a result, logical networking of devices and systems and integrated solutions can create more efficient
workflows and improve clinical results.

The growing expectations of patients regarding therapy and ultimately the treatment outcome must be
considered in the Company's research and development work. Examples include the AT LISA® and AT LISA®
tri toric, intraocular lenses capable of micro-incision in cataract surgery that allow less-invasive operations for
patients and visual acuity at all distances. The minimally invasive SMILE technology in refractive laser surgery
also enables a more gentle procedure for patients. The ReLEX® SMILE procedure has established itself as the
third generation of laser vision correction. Compared with previous procedures, ReLEx® SMILE stands out by
being considerably less invasive and offering very good predictability of correction. Since its launch in 2011,
approximately 600,000 eyes have now been successfully treated worldwide using this minimally invasive
method. The procedure has also had approval in the USA since September 2016.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Another example of close cooperation with our customers is PLEX ™ Elite 9000. PLEX™ Elite 9000'° is an
innovative and powerful application based on optical coherence tomography with swept-source technology.
PLEX™ Elite 9000 is currently being made available as research technology to leading scientists within the
scope of the "Advanced Retina Imaging Network" (ARIN). ARIN's focus is to test the next generation of opti-
cal coherence tomography technology. Using this innovative OCT technology, researchers can examine retinal
micro-structures and the tiniest of vessels in individual sections of the eye (e.g., vitreous, retina and choroid).
The delivery of OCT and OCT angiography imaging enables fast, dense, broad and deep visualization which
was not previously possible with other technologies.

Product requirements in rapidly developing economies such as India or China are often very different to the
requirements in established markets. That is why it is important to establish a market-specific product range.

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group aims to provide physicians in these regions with efficient workflows. Given the
particularly high numbers of patients, ease of use and versatility of the devices and systems, as well as cost,
play a crucial role.

Two examples are the OCT device PRIMUS 200 and the OPMI LUMERA® 300.

The Company has expanded its OCT portfolio to include the compact device ZEISS PRIMUS 200. The device
is easy to use, versatile and offers physicians new possibilities in clinical care, particularly those in smaller
ophthalmic practices and in countries with fast-growing markets. The OCT procedure is used, for example, to
visualize the retina in the posterior eye segment.

With the OPMI LUMERA® 300, the Company also provides a surgical microscope with an excellent price/
performance ratio, allowing physicians to benefit form the renowned quality of optics and illumination of the
ZEISS OPMI LUMERA product range.

However, the Company is also aware that meeting customer needs demands a strong on-site presence. With

the application and research center "CARIn" (Center of Application and Research in India) targeted investments
are being made in research and development projects in the immediate vicinity of our customers.

© The ZEISS PLEX™ Elite 9000 bears a CE marking. The device has no approval from the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

Brands and patents

The Company invests in innovations and solutions and ensures that these have an innovative edge with pat-
ents. The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group currently owns more than 800 patent families worldwide. The Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group is granted an average of one patent a week. Although the protection for a patent varies from
country to country, the Company still strives to protect products in the various markets as comprehensively
as possible with patents. Since a number of products have already been on the market for some time, patent
protection does not extend to the basic functionality of these products, but, rather, to individual features and
enhancements that protect beneficial solutions. As a result, the Group is able to successfully and permanently
maintain its position in the market.

In addition, the Company has more than 630 registered brands and brand registrations (as of 30 September,
2016). These include, among others, product names, slogans, images, logos and other specific characteristics
of the Company.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF CARL ZEISS MEDITEC AG

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG is the parent company of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group and is listed on the German
Stock Exchange. Its results are influenced to a large extent by its subsidiaries. The development of its business
is generally subject to the same opportunities and risks at that of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group. The out-

look for the Group also largely mirrors the expectations for Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, due to the links between
Carl Zeiss Meditec AG and its subsidiaries and due to the importance of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG within the Group.
The following explanations for the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group therefore also apply for Carl Zeiss Meditec AG

The aim of controlling at Carl Zeiss Meditec AG is to ensure the solvency of the Company and to manage this
efficiently throughout the Group. The EBIT margin and sales growth carry the most weight in this respect. The
Company's main source of liquidity comes from the business operations of its individual business units, upon
which the Company's financial activities and strategic focus are also based.

Preparation of the financial statements

Contrary to the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with the Internation-
al Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as they are to be applied in the EU, the following annual financial

growth trend of the last few fiscal year. Sales increased by 5.9% year-on-year (adjusted for currency effects:
5.7%). All strategic business units contributed to this growth to varying degrees. The increase in sales is in line
with the forecast for market growth, in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range, after adjustment for

Results of operations

Sales increased by 5.9% compared with the prior year (€651.1m), to €689.6m. This includes slightly positive
effects from foreign currency translation

Sales in the area of ophthalmology increased year-on-year, due in particular to the femtosecond technology
products, the innovative intraocular lenses and multifocal and toric premium lenses for minimally invasive
cataract surgery.

In fiscal year 2015/16, gross profit on sales increased from €305.8m to €336.4m. The corresponding margin
increased to 48.8%, due to a more favorable product and regional mix (prior year: 47.0%).

Selling expenses in the fiscal year amounted to €107.6m; general administrative expenses amount to €33.1m.

Selling and general administrative expenses are thus at around the same level as the prior year. Research and

development costs of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG amounted to €87.8m (prior year: €79.1m) in fiscal year 2015/16.

Detailed information on the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's research and development activities can be found on
pages 48 to 50.

The decline in other operating income is the result of lower exchange rate gains. The improvement in the
financial result is attributable, in particular, to a lower interest expense, which is mainly due to the change in

legislation regarding the discounting of pension provisions.

The result from ordinary activities increased from €59.1m in the prior year, to €80.9m in fiscal year 2015/16
Net income in the year under review amounted to €42.7m (prior year: €33.4m)

Net assets and results of operations

Pursuant to German commercial law (HGB), the total assets of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG amounted to €1,007.5m
as of 30 September 2016. This corresponds to an increase of 4.6% compared with the prior year (€962.9m).

The decline in financial assets compared with the prior year is primarily attributable to the repayment of a
loan granted to Atlantic S.A.S. and to the write-down of a loan to the subsidiary Carl Zeiss Meditec Iberia S.A.
Although, due to the currently difficult economic and political environment in the local Spanish market,

Carl Zeiss Meditec Iberia S.A. was unable to achieve its financial targets in the past fiscal year 2015/16,

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG continues to work on the basis of the going concern assumption.

The increase in receivables and other assets is mainly attributable to receivables from the Group treasury of

the ZEISS Group, which increased in the year under review from €206.1m in the prior year, to €236.4m, other
receivables from affiliated companies, which increased to €30.8m (prior year: €2.7m), and to trade receivables
from affiliated companies in the amount of €92.8m (prior year: €86.9m).

Cash and cash equivalents consist exclusively of bank balances. Term deposit balances are deposited with the
Group treasury of the ZEISS Group and are recognized under "Receivables from affiliated companies".

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Net retained profits increased by the net income for the year of €42.7m, less the dividend paid of €30.9m.

Provisions increased compared with the prior year, to €70.8m (prior year: €45.1m). This is mainly due to higher
tax provisions, particularly for foreign exchange transactions carried as liabilities, and outstanding invoices.
Further information can be found in the notes to the annual financial statements of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG in
the section entitled "Provisions".

The debt ratio (ratio of borrowed capital to equity) increased to 18.8% as of 30 September 2016 (30 Septem-
ber 2015: 15.2%).

Cash inflows generated from operating activities provide an important source of financing for the Carl Zeiss
Meditec AG. The Company can also create additional liquidity by issuing new shares on the capital market.
Furthermore, the Company has the option to assume loans either from the Group treasury of Carl Zeiss AG or
from banks. Since Carl Zeiss Meditec AG possesses sufficient cash funds to finance its operating and strategic
objectives, changes in credit conditions do not currently have any material effect on its financial position

Employees

As of 30 September 2016, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG had 1,196 employees. This figure does not include
Management Board members.

REMUNERATION REPORT
Remuneration of the Management Board
The members of the Management Board are remunerated based on Section 87 German Stock Corporation

Act (Aktiengesetz). According to this, the Supervisory Board determines the remuneration, which comprises
fixed and variable components, and payments in kind. The Supervisory Board's General Committee proposes


--- Page 28 ---

BACK TO CONTENTS

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

the amount and structure of the remuneration to be paid to the Management Board, and these are then
approved by the Supervisory Board as a whole. The appropriateness of the Management Board remuneration
is based on the duties and the personal contribution of the individual members of the Management Board, as
well as the Company's overall financial position and market environment.

At its meeting on 17 September 2015 the Supervisory Board addressed the Management Board objectives for
fiscal year 2015/16.

At its meeting on 8 December 15, the Supervisory Board addressed the achievement of objectives by the
Management Board members for fiscal year 2014/2015, and stipulated the relevant variable remunerations.
Furthermore, the salaries of Management Board members Dr. Christian Muller and Thomas Simmerer were
also reviewed during this meeting — based on the salary situation compared with the market, general price
and salary trends, and the achievements demonstrated and achievements anticipated in future — and adjusted
with effect from 1 October 2015

Following the request of Management Board member Thomas Simmerer for early termination of his Manage-
ment Board mandate, the Supervisory Board passed a resolution to this effect at its meeting on 2 June 2016,
and approved this, effective 30 September 2016.

The objectives for the Management Board for fiscal year 2016/17 were stipulated by the Supervisory Board
at its meeting on 14 September 2016. This meeting of the Supervisory Board also resolved upon the achieve-
ment of the objectives for fiscal year 2015/16 by Mr. Thomas Simmerer, as well as the conditions of his early
departure from the Management Board, effective 30 September 2016.

Structure and amount of remuneration paid to the Management Board

The remuneration paid to the Management Board of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG consists of a fixed and a variable
portion. The variable portion is split into two components: the first component is contingent upon the
achievement of certain targets for the respective current fiscal year and the second bears a long-term incen-
tive effect

The fixed portion of the remuneration paid to the Management Board is not contingent upon the achieve-
ment of certain targets. It is paid monthly.

The variable portion of the remuneration, which relates to targets set for the respective fiscal year, is
contingent upon the achievement of certain quantitative and qualitative targets. The quantitative objectives
mainly relate to Economic Value Added® ("EVA®") and free cash flow. Certain strategic targets agreed
individually with the members of the Management Board are also taken into consideration. This portion of
the remuneration is paid after the end of the respective fiscal year. The amount is contingent upon the
degree of target fulfillment.

In addition to the two components of Management Board remuneration described above, there is also a
so-called Long Term Incentive Program (LTI), which was redesigned and published in fiscal year 2011. This
program offers a remuneration component with a long-term incentive, which allows the members of the
Management Board to achieve an additional annual income after a three-year period. This amounts to 50%
of the individual short-term variable remuneration for the fiscal year that precedes the beginning of the term
of an LTI tranche, plus interest. This is based on the ZEISS Group's profit-participation certificate model.

A precondition for payment of this remuneration is that the members of the Management Board have not
handed in their notice at the end of the applicable three-year period per tranche, and the equity ratio of the
ZEISS Group is higher than 20% at this point. The first payment was made in December 2014. The next
payment is expected upon fulfillment of the payment requirements for December 2016.

Departure of members of the Management Board

In the event of premature termination of the employment relationship, the contracts for members of the
Management Board do not contain any explicit promise of a severance payment. A severance payment may,
however, ensue from a severance agreement concluded on an individual basis. The severance agreement
concluded in connection with the early departure of Mr. Simmerer on 30 September 2016 does not provide

for any additional severance payment.

Remuneration of the Supervisory Board

The remuneration of the Supervisory Board is composed of a fixed basic remuneration and remuneration for
work on the committees. The basic remuneration for each member of the Supervisory Board amounts to
€30k. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board shall receive double this amount; the Deputy Chairman and the
Chairman of the Audit Committee shall receive one-and-a-half times this amount. With the exception of the
members of the Nominating Committee and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the General Committee,

members of committees receive an additional, fixed remuneration of €5,000.

OPPORTUNITY AND RISK REPORT

Groups with global operations face a large number of entrepreneurial risks and opportunities that can have a
sustained impact on business success. The assessment of opportunities and risks and conscientious handling
of entrepreneurial uncertainty are an important part of corporate governance at the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group.

Risk management

The central risk management system at Carl Zeiss Meditec stipulates uniform rules and processes to detect,
assess and manage risks at an early stage. In the subsidiaries and on Group level, risk management coordina-
tors are responsible for applying the policies and procedures. The management of the subsidiaries detects and
manages operating and strategic risks. Overall responsibility lies with the Management Board, which regularly
assesses risks and their management at Group level together with the Group Risk Manager. The Management
Board and Supervisory Board review the appropriateness and monitoring of the risk management system.

Risk management is an integral part of corporate governance within the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group, and is
based on the following two key components: a risk reporting system and an internal control system.

< Mr. Thomas Spitzenpfeil waived his entitlement to remuneration by notices of waivers for fiscal year 2015/16 as in the prior year.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Risk reporting system

This is a clearly structured, traceable feedback loop which encompasses all of the Company's activities, is
integrated in its organizational structure and its control and reporting processes, and comprises a systematic
and ongoing process for the identification, assessment, management/control, as well as the documentation
and communication of any risks. This enables any relevant information to be immediately passed on to the
responsible decision makers. The main features of this system are as follows:

» The risk management system exclusively records risks. It integrates all fully consolidated subsidiaries.

» The business risks are assessed and categorized according to their potential implications over the period
of their existence, and according to their probability of occurrence and damage potential. The period of
assessment is a maximum of five years.

» Regular risk reports are provided to the Management Board, the management of the subsidiaries and other
decision-makers within the Company on the basis of specified thresholds. Significant risks arising at very
short notice are reported to this responsible group immediately.

» On this basis, appropriate steps are taken and evaluated to avoid identified risks or reduce the probability
of their occurrence, and to minimize the potential financial losses. The measures to reduce risks, the early
warning indicators and the residual risks derived from these are regularly updated and documented.

Internal control system

The internal control system of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is based on the COSO Enterprise Risk Manage-
ment Model (COSO ERM model). The Group's integrated enterprise risk management system covers strategic
and operational risks, i.e., it does not merely monitor financial risks. For central processes, there are key

risks and defined control mechanisms, which are regularly evaluated with regard to their effectiveness. The
Group’s Management Board ensures that an adequate and effective internal control system is in place and
that is it continuously enhanced. The Supervisory Board's Audit Committee monitors the efficiency of internal
auditing, risk management and the financial reporting process.

The accounting-related part of the internal control system is a system structured within the sphere of re-
sponsibility of and under the supervision of the CFO, which ensures that the preparation of the consolidated
annual financial statements is in line with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and that the
single-entity financial statements of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG are in line with German HGB, and that external
financial reporting is reliable.

Significant risks
The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group analyzes and assesses risks systematically. Special emphasis is placed on poten-
tial economic effects and on probability of occurrence. In this way, the risks are quantified and classified. Due

to the broad portfolio and the Group's global presence, the strategic and operational risks are widely spread.

Quantitative data is based on a net perspective after application of measures, and relates to the risk assess-
ment period

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Innovation risks

The business success and reputation of the Group are heavily dependent on the rapid development of
innovative products and solutions. New trends and current findings from science and research can give rise
to technology shifts, new customer requirements, and also make new business models necessary. Should the
Group lose touch with technological developments on the market, react too late to trends or technological
advancements, this could weaken its competitive position. There is also a risk of the Group’s products being
completely superseded by alternative technologies, procedures or treatment methods, thus reducing demand
for certain products, which could result in losses in sales and earnings. The potential impact on earnings of
these risks equates to an amount in the mid-single-digit to the low double-digit million euro range.

In order to exploit opportunities in this area early and keep the probability of occurrence and the economic
impact of this risk low in all segments, the Group invests heavily in research and development and upstream
areas of products with a technological edge and unique selling points.

Personnel risks

Demographic change and the shortage of skilled staff for technical jobs as well as the differing training and
qualifications standards around the globe are creating new challenges when it comes to filling job vacancies.
Unfilled positions could limit the technological advancement and sale of the products and services it offers
in all segments. The Group is countering this with a global recruitment strategy and active employee devel-
opment and successor planning, thus keeping the probability of occurrence low. In order to retain skilled
employees in the long term, the Group offers various employee benefits depending on the location — these
include, for example, offers for health promotion or child care. The management does not expect these risks
to have any material effects on the Group's net assets, financial position or results of operations.

Risks in procurement and production

ZEISS ensures conformity with national and international standards, guidelines and statutory provisions by
means of an integrated management system that addresses the issues of quality, the environment, and occu-
pational health and safety. To a very large extent the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group uses components from exter-
nal suppliers to manufacture its products in all business segments. The increase in the prices of commodities,
energy and materials, the growing complexity of purchased parts and the limited number of suppliers (single
source) for some technologies could have negative implications for the production, sales and the quality of
the Company’s products. The Group continues to work on stabilizing supply chains and reducing the depen-
dence on individual suppliers in order, among other things, to keep the associated economic impact low. The
Company systematically leverages opportunities that arise from bundling procurement activities. Furthermore,
the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group selects its suppliers carefully. By implementing consistent supply chain measures,
such as qualifying its suppliers, identifying secondary suppliers and preparing a strategic inventory plan, the
Carl Zeiss Meditec Group protects itself as best it can against supplier dependencies and changes on the
commodities market.

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group and the ZEISS Group have close contractual relationships in some areas. This
relates in particular to the procurement of IT services, the licensed use of the ZEISS brand and agreements
with distribution companies of the ZEISS Group. This distribution network provides major opportunities,
which are rooted particularly in the close-meshed coverage worldwide, a high level of professional distribu-
tion expertise, and a more efficient market development approach.

The potential effect of supplier risks on earnings is in the mid-single-digit to low double-digit million euro
range

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Risks of information technology

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group constantly reviews and utilizes the opportunities of digitization. This gives

rise to many new opportunities to provide customers with additional services. At the same time, the Group
constantly updates its existing IT systems, and its IT protection and IT security systems. Functioning and
adequately documented IT systems are also a prerequisite for obtaining product approvals in certain coun-
tries. Risks that, in the event of damage, could result in an interruption of business processes due to IT system
failures or the loss or falsification of data, are therefore identified and evaluated across the entire life cycle of
the applications and IT systems. Some of the Group's IT systems are operated by external partners. The Group
has defined high standards for these service providers with regard to the hardware and software used, as well
as data security. The Group continuously monitors the implementation of and compliance with these stan-
dards. The management does not expect this to have any material effects on the Group's net assets, financial
position or results of operations.

Risks from acquisitions

Acquisitions or investments offer the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group the opportunity to expand its portfolio of
expertise and technology, or to increase its access to regional markets. Acquisitions bear the entrepreneurial
risk of the acquired company not performing as well economically as expected in the market, or of the sales
and earnings targets being pursued with its acquisition not being reached, or of intended synergy effects with
the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group not being achievable. The Group systematically reviews the associated risks and
opportunities. A key element prior to concluding a transaction is a standard process for mergers & acquisi-
tions, including a due diligence review, to assess the expected business development. The economic impact
and probability of occurrence are therefore low.

Goodwill totaling €164.6m from acquisitions is shown in the consolidated statement of financial position
This goodwill is tested annually for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. A total of €162.5m of this goodwill
is attributable to the Ophthalmic Devices SBU, and €2.1m to the Microsurgery SBU. The impairment tests
carried out during the current fiscal year did not give any indication of impairment of the goodwill-bearing
cash-generating units (CGUs). Based on the development of business, the Group also anticipates positive
results from subsequent tests. Due to changes in general economic conditions or changes in business models,
impairment losses cannot be ruled out on goodwill recognized for individual or all companies acquired in

the past.

Legal risks, patents and intellectual property

The competitiveness of the Company depends on the protection of its technological innovations against ex-
ploitation of these innovations by third parties. Violations of intellectual property and patent protection may
compromise the Company's technological lead and thus its competitive advantage in all business segments.
The expiry of property rights, particularly patents, as well as the geographical limitation of property rights
could result in new or existing competitors exploiting the inventions of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group to enter
the market or strengthen their market position. Furthermore, in spite of the measures taken, third parties may
still attempt to copy or partly copy products of the Group, since the unauthorized use of intellectual property
is generally difficult to monitor and copyright laws only provide for limited protection.

The Group safeguards its technologies and products through a comprehensive industrial property rights
strategy. If ZEISS patent and brand rights are infringed by third parties, the Group takes legal steps in order
to counter the associated high economic risk. This being said, the probability of such cases occurring is low.
When developing new products and technologies, the Group systematically checks whether the rights of

a third party could be affected, develops non-protected solutions, if necessary, and acquires the requisite
licenses and rights, or seeks other solutions by legal contract. Overall, management in the area of patents
and intellectual property does not expect such risks to have any material effects on the Group's net assets,
financial position or results of operations.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Legal risks may arise due, among other things, to changes in general legal conditions in the relevant markets
and to legal disputes with competitors, business associates or customers.

There is no pending litigation that poses any risk to the continued existence of the Group at present. Should
it be necessary, adequate provisions will be set up as a precaution. Further details on litigation and arbitration
proceedings involving the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group can be found in note "(29) Contingent liabilities and other
financial commitments" in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Asa listed medical technology company with global activities, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is subject, in the
countries in which the Group operates, to a large number of laws, regulations and guidelines. In order to
ensure compliance with these regulations, these are regularly analyzed for any changes and internal processes
and guidelines are adjusted, if necessary. The Group has set out the basic principles of correct conduct in
business activities in a Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees. In order to avoid breaches of com-
pliance and minimize risks to the Group's reputation, the Group has established a corporate-wide compliance
organization. Regular training measures are also in place to familiarize the employees with internal guidelines
and make them aware of the negative effects breaches could have. The management does not expect this to
have any material effects on the Group's net assets, financial position or results of operations.

Financial risks

As a result of the European debt crisis there is a latent credit quality risk concerning business banks at which
the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group holds deposits via the ZEISS Cash Pool. Nevertheless, the Group has taken
various measures to mitigate risks. For example, a monitoring procedure has been introduced to monitor the
current situation in the capital markets.

The Company has categorized its financial risks as moderate. The basis for this categorization is the sound
financing structure with an equity ratio of 68.2%, the large reserve of cash and cash equivalents, and a strong
cash flow from operating activities. Cash and cash equivalents are kept in reserve at the Carl Zeiss Meditec
Group based on a rolling monthly cash forecast within a fixed planning period, and are managed as part of

a Groupwide ZEISS cash pool. The cash and cash equivalents in the cash pool at ZEISS are distributed among
several corporate banks in order to spread risk. Depending on the assessment of the credit risk for individual
banks, the cash and cash equivalents may be redistributed among these banks.

The financial risks also include liquidity risks, price fluctuation risks for financial instruments and risks associated
with fluctuations in cash flows. These risks and their management are adequately described in note "(35)
Financial risk management".

Economic environment

As a company with global operations, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is particularly exposed to developments
that pose a risk for the global economy. Therefore, the general global political situation, major natural
disasters, macroeconomic development and market trends in individual regions of the world may have diverse
effects on the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's chances of success in all business segments.

In particular the underlying conditions in the global economy have become more volatile over the past few
years, which has heightened economic risks overall. Economic growth may be curbed significantly by the euro
crisis, the debt situation in the USA and a slowdown in growth in China. Such a trend in the overall economic
situation may have an adverse effect on the economic situation of our customers and their demand for the
Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's products which could result in negative impacts on sales and earnings. Thanks to
the earlywarning system established within the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group, these risks are recognized in good
time and can be countered accordingly. In addition, the Group's international presence means it is less affect-
ed by regional crises, and the highly differentiated product and customer structure of the Company limits its
sales risks. According to current assessments, the Company is not exposed to any significant risks.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Market and competition

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is exposed to intense competitive pressure in both segments. Beside the market
entry of new competitors, there is also a risk, in the event of significant exchange rate fluctuations, that
competitors from the beneficiary countries may be able to offer considerably lower prices in the market, and
could therefore improve their competitive position. Some competitors are larger than the Company in terms
of their total revenue, and they have greater financial resources at their disposal to deal with competitive
pressure. In addition, existing competitors may be bought up by large, financially strong companies, or form
alliances with each other, which may lead to even greater competitive pressure, lower selling prices, margin
pressure and/or the loss of market shares. The Company prepares itself for such risks by continuously observ-
ing and analyzing the market, in order to be able to react with the necessary foresight.

The costs of certain medical treatments carried out using products of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group are
reimbursed by health insurance funds, insurance companies or government health schemes. Changes in

the health care and reimbursement policies in Germany or abroad may lead to the refusal or reduction of
reimbursements, which could reduce the demand for the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's products. In the case of
new products for which reimbursement cannot yet be predicted with certainty, demand may be considerably
dampened by the financial situation of consumers.

In addition, on the customer side, and particularly in the private healthcare sector, there is a noticeable
increase in the formation of regional and national purchasing alliances, as well as clinic chains. Such a trend
may lead to falling selling prices in this customer segment.

Collectively, the above issues related to market and competition may impact the Group's earnings by an
amount in the low double-digit million euro range. On the other hand, the demographic trend in industri-
alized countries and economic development in the RDEs, as well as the increasing requirements placed on
medical devices for diagnosing and treating age-related eye diseases, present growth opportunities for the
Company.

Product approval and political environment

As the Group aims to sell its products worldwide, such regulations have to be taken into consideration when
manufacturing and launching products in the market, especially where explicit regulatory approvals and
certifications are required.

Although the relevant legal requirements are incorporated into all stages of development, production and dis-
tribution, there is no guarantee that products requiring approval will be granted regulatory approval at all or
in time for their planned launch in the market, or that the Group's numerous registrations will still exist or be
renewed in the future. This may lead to sales losses and, in the case of delayed product launches, to competi-
tive disadvantages. Furthermore, registration requirements could become more stringent in future.

In order to be able to identify such developments in good time and react appropriately, the Group keeps a
very close eye on developments in this area and monitors approval procedures extremely closely as part of its
quality management system. Any residual risks that remain lie within the mid to high-single-digit million euro
range.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Certified quality management

A vital part of early risk detection is the Group's certified quality management system. Clearly structured and
documented quality management processes ensure not only transparency, but are now a prerequisite in
most markets for obtaining regulatory approval for medical devices. The quality assurance system employed
by the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group was certified by DQS GmbH Deutsche Gesellschaft zur Zertifizierung von
Managementsystemen and complies with the U.S. standard for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), 21 C.F.R
part 820, Quality System Regulation

Product liability risk

Some of the medical devices and system solutions and implants manufactured by the Company hold the
fundamental, inherent risk that, in spite of all reasonable measures being taken by the certified quality man-
agement system, and compliance with all legal requirements, malfunctions may result in injury to or adverse
effects for the patient. This may be due, among other things, to components and raw materials purchased
from external suppliers not meeting the specified quality requirements. Although no significant product liabil-
ity claims have been made against the Company to date, no assurance can be given that Carl Zeiss Meditec
will not be faced with such claims in the future. This may also lead to considerable legal costs, irrespective of
whether a claim for damages ultimately materializes. Risk liability claims can be particularly high, especially in
the USA, not to mention the costly recall campaigns that may be required.

The Company covers itself against potential product liability claims by taking out product liability insurance.
The possibility cannot be completely excluded that the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's existing insurance cover-
age may not be sufficient to cover potential claims. The potential impact these risks could have on earnings
equates to an amount in the low single-digit million euro range.

Infrastructure risks

Uncontrollable environmental influences, such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks, may result in the loss of
employees or an interruption to business operations at the affected locations, and may prevent the Company
from providing regular production, distribution and other services in these regions and generating the ex-
pected earnings. All business segments could be affected by this. In addition, it could have material adverse
effects on the Company's customers domiciled in the affected region and on their willingness to invest, as
well as the local suppliers there and their willingness to supply.

The Group's headquarters, with major research and development departments and other key Group func-
tions, are located in Germany, a region with a low risk of natural disasters. A second major production site is
located in the Greater San Francisco area in the USA, a region with an increased risk of earthquakes. In order
to minimize potential damage, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has set up a crisis management system, and has
also developed local and central plans for maintaining the functionality of critical business processes (business
continuity plans). For this reason the Company does not expect any material adverse effects on its net assets,
financial position or results of operations.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Risks relating to the Group accounting process

The main risks in the accounting process are that the financial statements may not provide a true and fair
view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations as a result of unintentional errors or willful
actions, or that there is a delay in publishing these. The accounting would not present a true and fair view
of the Company in this case. Deviations are classified as significant if they could individually or collectively
influence the economic decisions taken by the recipients of the financial statements based on the financial
statements.

In the area of accounting and Group accounting, processes ensure the completeness and accuracy of the
financial statements, by way of regularly reviewed, integrated, preventive and detective controls. All of the
Group's internal accounting and valuation guidelines are collated in an accounting manual, which is available
via the Group's intranet to all of the relevant organizational units and all of the Company's employees, along
with the Group-wide financial reporting calendar. In addition, supplementary instructions for methods, stan-
dardized reporting formats, IT systems and IT-supported reporting and consolidation processes support the
process for uniform and proper consolidated accounting.

The operative, timely implementation of the systemic requirements is effected by the affected areas of

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG and its subsidiaries. These are supported and monitored by Carl Zeiss Meditec's
Finance Group department. The Finance Group department is responsible for consolidated reporting, includ-
ing Group-wide financial and management information, forecasts, budgets and risk reporting. Acts of law,
accounting standards and other pronouncements are continuously analyzed with regard to their relevance for
and impact on the consolidated and annual financial statements.

Additional disclosures pursuant to Section 289 (2) No. 2 HGB, Section 315 (2) No. 2 HGB

Price fluctuation risks can generally not be ruled out. However, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group counters these
risks by focusing on product innovations and optimizing its production costs through cost-cutting and
efficiency-enhancing measures.

Potential risks of default on trade receivables — particularly given the euro and debt crisis and the generally
greater risk of bad debt losses that comes with it — are minimized by means of an active credit control system.
The Group also regularly sets up adequate provisions to cover such risks. On the whole, however, we consider
this to be a limited risk. The ratio of value adjustments of trade receivables to consolidated revenue was

0.8% in the year under review (prior year: 0.5%).

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's financial situation can be considered stable. Cash and cash equivalents
amounted to €8.7m as of the balance sheet date 30 September 2016. Added to this is credit of 354.5m
recognized as accounts receivable from group treasury of Carl Zeiss AG. In addition, the Group generated
cash flows from operating activities of €111.8m in the reporting period. From a current perspective, there-
fore, there are no significant liquidity risks.

All cash and cash equivalents, including the balances at the Group treasury of Carl Zeiss AG, are deposited
at banks. Should it come to a loss of individual banks — due in particular to the euro and debt crisis — the
existing balances there may be endangered. The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group counters this risk by continuously
monitoring the solvency of the banks with which it has a business relationship, and by spreading its assets
among several banks via the Group treasury of Carl Zeiss AG.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

As a company with global operations, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is exposed to the effects of exchange rate
fluctuations. In order to hedge against this currency risk, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group concludes currency
forward contracts based on planned transactions in foreign currency. These contracts generally span a period
of up to one year. Based on current exchange rate fluctuations, currency effects may continue to curtail the
financial result dependent on the extent of the fluctuations.

Overall assessment of the Company's risk situation

At the time of preparation of this report, there were no discernible risks that could jeopardize the continued
existence of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group. There are no significant differences in the overall assessment
compared with the prior year. The Management Board sees a solid foundation for further development of the
Group and uses a systematic strategy and planning process to provide the necessary resources to exploit any
opportunities.

DISCLOSURES PURSUANT TO SECTION 289 (4) AND SECTION 315 (4) HGB

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG's subscribed capital amounts to €81,309,610 and is composed of 81,309,610 no-par
value ordinary bearer shares (no-par value shares), each with a theoretical interest in the share capital of
€1.00 per no-par value share. Each share entitles the bearer to one voting right and an equal share in Company
profits.

Other shares or shares with special rights that grant supervisory powers do not exist. Nor are there restric-
tions on the part of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG concerning the voting rights or transfer of shares. Furthermore,
the Management Board is not aware of any other agreements concluded, for example, between individual
shareholders.

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG is aware of the following direct and indirect holdings in the capital of Carl Zeiss
Meditec AG that exceed ten percent of the voting rights. Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany, holds, both
directly and indirectly, a total of 65.05% of the voting rights in Carl Zeiss Meditec AG.

This corresponds to 52,893,270 no-par value shares. These include 7.47% of the voting rights or 6,074,256
no-par value shares in Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, which Carl Zeiss AG holds indirectly via its wholly owned subsid-
iary Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, USA.

Employees of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG or its affiliated companies pursuant to Section 15 et seqq. AktG, who
participated in the Company via employee share plans concerning the share capital of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG
in prior years, exercise their control rights directly like all other shareholders of the Company.

Pursuant to Section 179 and Section 133 AktG, an amendment to the Articles of Association requires a
resolution by the Annual General Meeting which, in turn, requires a simple majority of the votes cast and

a majority comprising at least three quarters of the share capital represented at the time the resolution is
passed. The Articles of Association may specify a different capital majority; in the case of an amendment to
the purpose of the Company, however, only a larger capital majority may be specified. Art. 25 of Carl Zeiss
Meditec AG's Articles of Association states that in cases for which the law requires a majority of the share
capital represented at the time of resolution, a simple majority of the share capital represented is sufficient,
provided that a greater majority is not mandatory by law. In accordance with Art. 28 of the Articles of Associ-
ation of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, the Supervisory Board is authorized to resolve amendments to the Articles of
Association that only affect the version. This complies with Section 179 (1) Sentence 2 AktG.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

The legal provisions concerning the appointment and dismissal of members of the Management Board are set
forth in Section 84 and Section 85 AktG. In compliance with this, Art. 6 (2) of the Articles of Association of
Carl Zeiss Meditec AG stipulates that the Supervisory Board shall be responsible for appointing and dismissing
the members of the Management Board. Pursuant to statutory provisions, a member of the Management
Board may only be dismissed for compelling reasons.

Pursuant to Art. 4 (5) of the Articles of Association of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, the Company has an Autho-
rized Capital. Accordingly, the Management Board is authorized, subject to the approval of the Supervisory
Board, to increase the share capital, on one or several occasions in the period until 5 April 2021, by up to
€40,654,805.00. New no-par value bearer shares may be issued against cash and/or contributions in kind for
this. The Management Board is authorized, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the
statutory subscription right of shareholders in the following cases:

» to balance out fractional amounts,

» if the capital increase is effected against cash contributions and the new shares, for which the subscription
rights are excluded, are equivalent to no more than 10% of the share capital, neither on the date the
increase becomes effective, nor on the date this authorization is exercised, and the issuing price of the
new shares is not significantly lower than the market price of shares of the same type and structure already
publicly quoted. Sales of treasury shares on the basis of other authorizations pursuant to Section 186 (3)
sentence 4 AktG must be taken into account in the restriction to 10% of the share capital

» for capital increases against contributions in kind to grant shares for the purpose of acquiring companies,
parts thereof or interests in a company.

The Management Board is authorized, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to specify the details
of capital increases from Authorized Capital.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT

No events of material significance for the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations
occurred after the end of fiscal year 2015/16.

The development of business at the beginning of fiscal year 2016/17 validates the statements made in the
following "Outlook"

OUTLOOK
Corporate strategy

As market and technology leader in the field of ophthalmology and microsurgery, our aim is to achieve
sustainable, profitable growth, by improving the diagnosis and treatment of diseases with our products and
solutions. Our success factors are: Innovation, the development of integrated solutions and customer focus.
Innovation, in particular, plays a key role.

Customer focus

Our customers are facing major challenges in managing rising case numbers, limited public funding and more
demanding expectations of patients with respect to the treatment outcome. With our integrated products
and solutions we can help to increase the efficiency of workflows and reduce costs, for example by providing
clinical decision aids for the physician and options for easy outsourcing of routine tasks to medical auxiliary
staff. Digitization offers us massive opportunities in this respect, for example in the field of data manage-
ment solutions. For us, a key prerequisite for our long-term success is having a deep understanding of our
customers’ problems and offering a range of services that is tailored to solving these problems. In fiscal year
2015/16, the service share of Group revenue amounted to approximately 10%. We expect the share of
consolidated revenue generated by our Service business to increase further in the medium term.

Innovation

Our goal is to make cutting-edge technology in medical application accessible for our customers. We are
therefore striving to establish our products as the new gold standards in medical diagnostics and therapy. We
ensure our technology leadership by continuing to invest heavily in research and development.

Integrated solutions

Given the multitude of diagnostic and therapeutic devices typically used in medical practices and clinics,
customers the offered the opportunity to make their workflows more efficient, and to achieve better clinical
outcomes, by logically networking their devices and systems. A comprehensive system integration including
IT-assisted analysis functions is essential for this.

Future conditions for business development

Macroeconomic environment
At the current time, fiscal year 2016/17 is still expected to bring moderate economic growth.

The global economy is growing, but with considerable regional variations. The stagnating growth rates in
the industrialized world are being offset by growth in the rapidly developing economies, which, although
still good, is now tailing off in places. According to forecasts, economic growth in the United States will be
moderate, while the economies of Japan and Europe are expected to decline — also due to Brexit. In China a
“new normality” is expected with flatter growth rates and a transformation process in industry. According to
forecasts, the Indian economy shall experience above-average growth; Brazil is pulling out of its recession,
with marginal growth

Uncertainties regarding economic development in the emerging markets, low oil prices, the unpredictable
effects of Brexit, the presidential elections in the U.S., the situation in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as
ongoing structural problems, are major political and economic issues, which may have an adverse effect on
the investing activities of industry and the public sector.

Future situation in the medical technology industry

The Company's management anticipates further growth in the medical technology market, as the main
growth drivers — such as the growing global population, the rising number of older people, and the increas-
ing proportion of the global population with access to medical care — shall remain unchanged.

Furthermore, the greater requirements being placed on the innovations in the medical technology sector play
an important role from an efficiency and cost perspective. Consequently, the products and procedures of
medical technology manufacturers shall no longer be measured based solely on their effectiveness and safety,
but also on their cost-efficiency. Integrated system solutions for simplified workflows at the customer are an
important distinguishing feature in our opinion.

Last but not least, the development of the global economy influences the growth of the medical technology
industry in as much as private customers or public budgets postpone their investment decisions until the
future, or make them early.

At the present time the medical technology industry is expected to grow in the coming years in the low to
mid-single-digit percentage range.

Future development in the strategic business units of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group

Due to the persistent, long-term growth trends in our markets — such as the growing global population, the
rising proportion of elderly people and improved access to medical care — the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is
generally anticipating further market growth. From a current perspective, and excluding currency effects, this
corresponds to growth in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range. The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group expects
revenue growth that is at least on a par with market growth.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Strategic business unit Ophthalmic Devices

In the past year, revenue developed positively in the Ophthalmic Devices sector. The revenue increase was also
partly due to positive currency effects. We anticipate further growth in 2016/17. Both the products already es-
tablished on the market for diagnosing and treating ophthalmic diseases, as well as other innovations launched
in the course of the past fiscal year shall contribute to this growth. When designing efficient solutions for our
customers, system networking and integrated data management play a key role, for example our data manage-
ment system, FORUM®. Another example is in the area of refractive lasers, where the ReLEx® SMILE procedure
has established itself as the third generation of laser vision correction. Compared with previous procedures,
ReLEX® SMILE stands out by being considerably less invasive and offering very good predictability of correction.
To date, about 600,000 eyes worldwide have been successfully treated using this microinvasive method. With
the AT LISA® tri and AT LISA® tri toric, the Company offers the leading MICS-compliant trifocal intraocular lens
on the market of cataract surgery. We are also aiming to attract new customer groups and increase our revenue
from existing customers by expanding our range of monofocal intraocular lenses.

We are confident that we shall grow at least to the same extent as the underlying market in the new fiscal year.
From a current perspective, and excluding currency effects, this corresponds to growth in the low to mid-single-
digit percentage range. The EBIT margin is also expected to remain above the Group average.

Strategic business unit Microsurgery

In the fiscal year under review, the Microsurgery SBU recorded slight revenue growth, which was, however,
largely due to positive currency effects. We therefore successfully defended our already exceptionally strong
market position. Our surgical microscopes, the OPMI® Pentero® for neuro, spinal or plastic surgery, and the
OPMI® VARIO, which is used in ENT surgery, for example, mean we are broadly diversified and are exploiting
the associated market opportunities to an even greater degree by upgrading the products in terms of additional
supporting applications for the user.

We expect the Microsurgery SBU to continue to make significant contributions to earnings in future. We are
confident that we shall grow at least to the same extent as the underlying market in the coming fiscal year.
From a current perspective, and excluding currency effects, this corresponds to growth in the low-single-digit
percentage range. The EBIT margin is also expected to remain significantly above the Group average

Future selling markets

As a global Group, our aim in the years ahead shall be to maintain as balanced a distribution of revenue as
possible across our individual markets. The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group currently generates around one third of its
revenue in all three of its strategically important business regions: EMEA, the Americas and APAC. We see par-
ticularly promising business prospects for the long term in the APAC region, due to the rapid economic growth
there. ZEISS Group's research centers in India and China, which the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group uses for product
development, shall help to expand and secure this growth. We aim to leverage the potential in these countries
to an even greater extent in future and generate further revenue growth.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Future research and development activities

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group invests considerable funds in research and development projects, with efficient
and targeted development processes playing a key role. Upstream from this is the search for new technologies
and market trends, in order to subsequently become established on the market with new solutions. The
important thing is to consider the regional market conditions and the needs of our customers in the develop-
ment process from the outset. We aim to invest around 10% to 11% of revenue in research and development
in fiscal year 2016/17, which is about the same as in prior years.

Future investments

Investments are a basic requirement to be able to maintain our technology leadership in future. The invest-
ment ratio at the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has been largely constant in the past few years. The investments
required to realize growth targets shall not lead to a material change in the current investment ratio in the
coming fiscal year. We aim to invest around 1% to 2% of revenue in property, plant and equipment in fiscal
year 2016/17, which is about the same as in prior years.

Future dividend policy

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG pursues a long-term and earnings-oriented dividend policy. The Company's manage-
ment plans to propose to the Annual General Meeting the distribution of a dividend of €0.42 per share for
the past fiscal year. The dividend ratio would therefore be at 34.7% (prior year: 49.6%). The management
also intends to allow shareholders to continue to participate fairly in the Company's success in future. The
special dividend, an instrument that has been used several times in the past, may also be used again.

Future employee development

Our employees are indispensable for the Company's success: we need them to be able to continue to work
innovatively and profitably in future. It is equally important to us to keep investing in the further develop-
ment of our existing employees in future, as well as to recruit well qualified specialists and managers for the
Company. We therefore expect our workforce to grow in the coming periods in line with the growth of the
Company's business.

Future financial position

Interest income and expenses depend on changes in interest rates on the financial markets. At present, the
Company does not expect any marked improvements in investment conditions in the next two years. Interest
income and interest expenses are thus expected to remain around the prior year's level. As of 30 September
2016 current cash and cash equivalents of around €334.6m were available for financing. In view of this, as
well as the ongoing expectation of positive business development and a positive cash flow from operating
activities as a result, and the possibility to use other financial instruments and sources of financing, if required,
we consider the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's financing capacity to be adequate. In 2016/17 we aim to achieve
operative cash flow in the high double-digit millions, based on active working capital management.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

Future opportunities

The global medical technology market is characterized by fundamentally sustainable growth. This applies to
both ophthalmology and microsurgery and assures us of good selling conditions for the Company. Additional
opportunities are provided by our innovative and broad product range, which we shall continue to expand

in the coming fiscal year. Our strong financial profile, which safeguards the Company's development against
external influences, should also have a positive effect. The Company is in a position to protect itself against
direct risks in the short term, without losing sight of its long-term objectives. Due to our ZEISS brand, our
customers perceive us as a reliable and trustworthy partner, and we look back on a long, successful collabora-
tion. We can therefore build upon an extremely positive brand image.

Our development in future shall also include external growth opportunities in some areas. Using a systematic
process, we shall look for strategically useful expansion opportunities. It is not possible at this point to gauge
how feasible such opportunities might be.

Overall assertion on future development

At the time of publication of this Annual Report the management of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group considers
the outlook for the coming fiscal year to be positive. This assumption is based on the persistent long-term
trends: An ever-growing global population and the constantly growing number of older people associated
with an increasing life expectancy. This is particularly significant for ophthalmology, since the incidence of
diseases in this field is strongly related to the age of the patients. Better and better access to medical care in
the emerging economies also offers long-term potential for growth for medical technology products.

Given the favorable conditions for market development in the medium and long term, and the Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group's good strategic position, the Company's management currently assumes that revenue will
continue to grow in the coming fiscal year, provided that general economic conditions remain stable. We
anticipate revenue growth that is at least on a par with the market growth expected for the industry. From a
current perspective, and excluding currency effects, this corresponds to growth in the low to mid-single-digit
percentage range.

A crucial advantage for even greater stability of our overall business is a higher proportion of revenue with
case-number-dependent products and services, since there is generally less fluctuation in these areas than in
the capital goods business, for example. In fiscal year 2015/16 we achieved a share of 32.4%. From a current
perspective, we expect a further increase in fiscal year 2016/17 and for the medium term.

In fiscal year 2015/16 the EBIT margin increased significantly from 12.6% in the prior year to 14.2%. In fiscal
year 2016/17 we expect the EBIT margin to be within the target corridor also forecast for the medium term,
of 13.0% to 15.0%.

In terms of free cash flow for fiscal year 2016/17, we are continuing to aim for a figure that is at least in the
high double-digit million range. We expect Economic Value Added (EVA) in the coming fiscal year to remain
on a par with EVA in fiscal year 2015/16.

Should there be any significant changes in the economic environment currently forecast over the course of
the fiscal year, and should it thus become necessary to amend the statements made here on the development
of business from today's perspective, we shall publish these amendments promptly and specify our expecta-
tions in more detail.
