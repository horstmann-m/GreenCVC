Combined Management Report

Financial Year 2017 in Review
Bertelsmann recorded positive business performance in 2017, achieving revenue growth and increases
in operating EBITDA and Group profit. This development was accompanied by further strategic
progress with Bertelsmann’s transformation into a faster-growing, more digital, more international
and diversified Group. Group revenues rose by 1.4 percent to €172 billion (previous year: €17.0 billion),
driven by organic growth of 1.7 percent. This was generated in particular by the TV, music, services and
education businesses. The revenue share generated by the strategic growth businesses increased to
32 percent (previous year: 30 percent). Operating EBITDA of €2,636 million was above the high level
of the previous year of €2,568 million, despite start-up losses for digital and new businesses, which

for Bertelsmann Education Group and RTL Group alone, amounted to €-69 million in total (previous
year: €-71 million). RTL Group, BMG and Bertelsmann Education Group were mainly responsible
for the improved earnings. The EBITDA margin improved from 15.2 percent in the previous year to
15.3 percent. Group profit increased from €1,137 million to €1,198 million. Economic investments
during the reporting period increased to €1.8 billion (previous year: €1.3 billion), in particular as a

result of the shareholding increase in Penguin Random House. For 2018, Bertelsmann again expects
positive business performance and continued progress with the implementation of its strategy.

S.A. is listed on the German MDAX index.

Penguin Random House is, based on revenue, the world’s
largest trade book publisher, with more than 250 imprints
across six continents. Its book brands include storied imprints
such as Doubleday, Viking and Alfred A. Knopf (United
States); Ebury, Hamish Hamilton and Jonathan Cape (United
Kingdom); Plaza & Janés and Alfaguara (Spain); Sudamericana
(Argentina); and the international imprint Dorling Kindersley.
Germany's Verlagsgruppe Random House, which includes
illustrious publishing houses such as Goldmann and Heyne,
is not part of Penguin Random House from a legal point of
view, but is under the same corporate management and
is part of the Penguin Random House division. Each year
Penguin Random House publishes over 15,000 new titles
and sells more than 600 million print books, e-books and

Gruner + Jahr is one of Europe's leading premium magazine
publishers. Its magazine portfolio includes established brands
such as “Stern,” “Brigitte” and “Geo” — and young brands like
“Barbara,” “Beef” and “Chefkoch.” It also has products and
licenses such as the “Schéner Wohnen” furniture collection
and digital offerings in all publishing segments, from News
to People to Living. In digital marketing G+J operates inter-
national platforms (Ligatus, AppLike). Territory, one of the
largest German communication agencies for brand content, is
also part of G+J. In France, G+J operates Prisma Media, the
country’s largest print and digital magazine publisher in terms

Brazil Investments (BBI), Bertelsmann Asia Investments (BAI),
Bertelsmann India Investments (BII) and Bertelsmann Digital
Media Investments (BDMI).

Regulatory Environment

In several European countries Bertelsmann has television
and radio operations that are subject to regulation. In
Germany, for example, the media is subject to oversight by
the Commission on Concentration in the Media. Bertelsmann
Group companies occupy leading market positions in many
lines of business and may therefore have limited potential
for growth through acquisition due to antitrust legislation.
Moreover, some education activities are subject to regula-
tory provisions of government authorities and accreditation
bodies.

As its profit participation certificates and bonds are publicly
listed, Bertelsmann is required to comply in full with capital
market regulations applicable to publicly traded companies.

Shareholder Structure

Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is an unlisted partnership limited
by shares. Three foundations (Bertelsmann Stiftung, Reinhard
Mohn Stiftung and BVG-Stiftung) indirectly hold 80.9 percent
of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA shares, with the remaining
19.1 percent held indirectly by the Mohn family. Bertelsmann
Verwaltungsgesellschaft (BVG) controls all voting rights at
the General Meeting of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and
Bertelsmann Management SE (general partner).

Strategy

Bertelsmann’s primary objective is continuous growth of the
company’s value through a sustained increase in profitability
with efficient capital investment at the same time (see the
“Value-Oriented Management System” section).

Bertelsmann aims to achieve a faster-growing, more digital,
more international and more diversified Group portfolio.
Businesses in which Bertelsmann invests should have long-
term stable growth, global reach, stable and protectable
business models, high market-entry barriers and scalability. The
education business is being gradually developed into the third
earnings pillar alongside the media and service businesses. The
Group strategy comprises four strategic priorities: Strengthening
the core businesses, driving the digital transformation forward,
developing growth platforms and expanding into growth
regions. In the financial year 2017, Bertelsmann continued to
make progress in line with these strategic priorities.

Among other things, merging RTL Radio France with Groupe
M6 helped to strengthen the core businesses. Bertelsmann also
acquired a further 22 percent stake in Penguin Random House
from the co-shareholder Pearson and now holds a strategic
three-quarters majority in the world’s largest trade book pub-
lisher based on revenue. Penguin Random House strength-
ened its market positions in Spain and Latin America with the
acquisition of the Ediciones B publishing group. Gruner + Jahr
continued to focus strongly on Germany and France by selling off
the businesses in the Netherlands and China and discontinuing
the international businesses of Motor Presse Stuttgart. Arvato
Systems acquired the software provider Next Level Integration
which specializes in the energy industry, and Vidispine, a com-
pany specialized in the media asset management sector. The
“future package” for the German gravure printing business that
was decided in 2017 is designed to cut costs and safeguard the
three gravure printing locations in the medium term.

The digital transformation of the businesses also continued.
RTL Group expanded its advertising technology business
through the acquisition of the remaining shares in the
programmatic video advertising company SpotX and the
stronger integration of individual businesses into an extensive
advertising technology platform. Penguin Random House
expanded its range of products for targeting readers directly
and grew its audio downloads business. Gruner + Jahr achieved
growth in the German digital business.

Among other things, the growth platform Fremantle Media
expanded its drama business through new productions such
as “American Gods,” undertook further investments and
entered into further talent deals. BMG acquired the country


--- Page 4 ---

label group BBR Music Group, made further investments and
signed many new artists. Arvato SCM Solutions expanded
its logistics network in Germany, the Netherlands, Poland
and the United States and achieved growth primarily though
customers in the e-commerce, high-tech, entertainment and
healthcare sectors. Arvato Financial Solutions acquired a
stake in the fintech start-up Solaris Bank. In education, Relias
achieved strong organic growth and acquired WhiteCloud
Analytics, a company providing analyses and performance
management in the hospital sector. Udacity posted strong
growth with existing and recently introduced Nanodegrees.

In the growth regions, Bertelsmann further expanded its global
network of start-up investments. During the reporting period, the
company made over 40 new investments worldwide through
the funds grouped under Bertelsmann Investments. In China,
the Bertelsmann Asia Investments fund made various new and
follow-up investments, achieved further significant value growth
and made a considerable contribution to Group profit in par-
ticular through gains from disposals of investments. In India the
Bertelsmann India Investments fund invested in the education
provider Eruditus. Arvato CRM Solutions acquired the IT and
analytics company Ramyam. In Brazil, the Bertelsmann Brazil
Investments fund and its partner Bozano Investimentos contin-
ued their establishment of a network of universities focusing on
education in the healthcare sector. Arvato Financial Solutions
increased its stake in the financial services provider Intervalor.

Bertelsmann will push ahead with its ongoing transformation
in 2018 in line with the four strategic priorities. Compliance
with and achievement of the strategic development priorities
are continuously examined by the Executive Board at the
divisional level through regular meetings of the Strategy
and Business Committee and as part of the annual Strategic
Planning Dialogue between the Executive Board and the
Supervisory Board. In addition, relevant markets and the
competitive environment are analyzed on an ongoing basis in
order to draw conclusions concerning the further development
of the Group's strategy. The Executive Board is also supported
by the Group Management Committee on issues of corporate
strategy and development. This Committee is composed of
executives representing key businesses, countries, regions
and select Group-wide functions.

The Group's content-based and entrepreneurial creativity will
remain very important for the implementation of its strategy.
Bertelsmann will therefore continue to invest significantly in
the creative core of its businesses. In addition, Bertelsmann
needs to have qualified employees at all levels of the Group
to ensure its strategic and financial success. Innovation com-
petence is also very important for Bertelsmann and is a key
strategic component (see the “Innovations” section).

Value-Oriented Management System

Bertelsmann’s primary objective is continuous growth of the
company’s value through a sustained increase in profitability.
To manage the Group, Bertelsmann has been using a value-
oriented management system for many years, which focuses
on revenues, operating earnings and optimal capital invest-
ment. For formal reasons, Bertelsmann makes a distinction
between strictly defined and broadly defined operational per-
formance indicators.

Strictly defined operational performance indicators, includ-
ing revenues, operating EBITDA and Bertelsmann Value
Added (BVA), are used to directly assess current business
performance and are correspondingly used in the outlook.
These are distinguished from performance indicators used in
the broader sense, which are partially derived from the above-
mentioned indicators or are strongly influenced by these. These
include the EBITDA margin and the cash conversion rate. The
financial management system, with defined internal financ-
ing targets, is also part of the broadly defined value-oriented
management system. Details of the expected development of
performance indicators used in the broader sense are provided
as additional information and are not included in the outlook.

To explain the business performance and to control and man-
age the Group, Bertelsmann also uses alternative performance
measures that are not defined in accordance with IFRS (more
details are given in the “Alternative Performance Measures”
section).

Strictly Defined Operational Performance Indicators

To control and manage the Group, Bertelsmann uses revenues,
operating EBITDA and BVA as performance indicators.
Revenue is used as a growth indicator of businesses. Group
revenues in the financial year 2017 rose by 1.4 percent to
€17.2 billion (previous year: €17.0 billion). The organic growth
was 1.7 percent.

A key performance indicator for measuring the profitability
of the Bertelsmann Group and the divisions is the operating
EBITDA. Operating EBITDA increased to €2,636 million
(previous year: €2,568 million) in the reporting period.

Bertelsmann uses BVA for assessing the profitability of opera-
tions and return on invested capital. BVA measures the profit
realized above and beyond the appropriate return on invested
capital. BVA in the financial year 2017 was €121 million com-
pared to the previous year’s figure of €147 million. The impact
of the increase in average invested capital could only partially
be offset by the improved year-on-year operating earnings.

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2017 7


--- Page 5 ---

From the 2018 financial year onward, BVA will be determined
without taking into account the Bertelsmann Investments
division. Based on this methodology, BVA for financial
year 2017 was €163 million (previous year: €180 million).

Broadly Defined Performance Indicators

To assess business development, other performance indica-
tors are used that are partially derived from revenues and
operating EBITDA or are strongly influenced by these figures.

The cash conversion rate serves as a measure of cash gen-
erated from business activities, which should be between
90 percent and 100 percent as a long-term average. In the
financial year 2017 the Cash Conversion Rate was 92 percent
(previous year: 93 percent).

The EBITDA margin is used as an additional criterion for
assessing business performance. In the financial year 2017,
the EBITDA margin of 15.3 percent was above the previous
year’s level of 15.2 percent.

Bertelsmann’s financial management and controlling system
is defined by the internal financial targets outlined in the “Net
Assets and Financial Position” section. These financing principles
are pursued in the management of the Group and are included in
the broadly defined value-oriented management system.

The non-financial performance indicators (employees, corporate
responsibility and similar topics) are not included in the broadly
defined value-oriented management system. As they can only
be measured to a limited extent, it is not possible to make any
clear quantifiable statements concerning interrelated effects and
value increases. For this reason, the non-financial performance
indicators are not used for the management of the Group.

Non-Financial Performance Indicators

The following section describes the non-financial perfor-
mance indicators at Bertelsmann. For more information about
the organization, management and key topics of corporate
responsibility, please refer to page 40 ff. of the “Combined
Non-Financial Statement” section.

Employees
At the end of the financial year 2017, the Group had
119,089 employees worldwide. In 2017, there were 1,225 people

serving in trainee positions in Bertelsmann companies in
Germany.

8 Financial Information Combined Management Report

The purpose of the human resources (HR) strategy is to support
the implementation of the Group's strategy. In 2017, the main
focus was again on the further development and training of
employees. This included a comprehensive adaptation of the
central talent management processes and tools, including the
expansion of talent pools and digital learning.

Continuous employee training is the basis of a company’s
future economic success. In view of this, the training courses
offered by Bertelsmann University have been further digitized
and expanded, for example through a Group-wide scholarship
program for data science. Furthermore, at the end of 2017,
some 90,000 employees in 46 countries were able to access
training courses on the Group-wide digital “peoplenet” HR IT
platform.

At Bertelsmann, partnership primarily involves working with
employees to shape the company. To ensure that this hap-
pens, the Employee Survey has been an important tool for
many years at Bertelsmann. Measures were developed and
piloted, based on the feedback from the previous year's
Employee Survey.

Supporting dialogue between the employee representatives
and dialogue with Bertelsmann management is also very
important for a cooperative corporate culture. At the Group
Dialogue Conference in December 2017, future work devel-
opments were discussed, and new concepts developed. In
addition, the recommendations of the Bertelsmann Diversity
Conference 2016 concerning training and career development
were implemented.

Continuing to develop the corporate culture is another priority
of the HR strategy. In 2017, the Group began to revise the
Bertelsmann Essentials (company values) in accordance with
the Sense of Purpose formulated in 2016.

Bertelsmann has been one of the pioneers in profit sharing
since 1970. Accordingly, in 2017, a total of €105 million of the
2016 profit was distributed to employees across the Group
(previous year: €95 million).

Corporate Responsibility

The aim of corporate responsibility (CR) at Bertelsmann is to
bring the economic interests in line with the Group's social
and ecological concerns as part of a dialogue with all relevant
stakeholders.

In view of this, the Bertelsmann CR Council continued its
cross-divisional dialogue and the strategic further devel-
opment of significant Group-wide CR topics in 2017. The


--- Page 6 ---

focus here was on topics of particular relevance relating to
employee and social concerns, respect for human rights,
the fight against corruption and bribery, and environmental
concerns. Bertelsmann made donations and was involved in
funding initiatives in the areas of education, culture, science
and creativity.

Innovations

Businesses invest in the research and development of new
products in order to ensure their long-term competitiveness.
The media sector has a similar imperative to create innovative
media content and media-related products and services
in a rapidly changing environment. This means that rather
than conventional research and development activities, the
company’s own innovative power and business development
are particularly important to Bertelsmann. The long-term
success of the Group depends heavily on product innovations,
investing in growth markets and integrating new technologies.
Furthermore, innovative expertise is very important for
strategy implementation.

Bertelsmann relies on innovation and growth in core opera-
tions and new business fields. The key success factors of
Bertelsmann’s innovation management include continuously
following cross-industry trends and observing new markets.
At the Group level, Bertelsmann works with the divisions
to continuously identify and implement innovative busi-
ness strategies. Alongside market-oriented activities, sup-
port is given to Group-wide initiatives that actively promote
knowledge transfer and collaboration. At regular innovation
forums, executives meet with internal and external experts to
examine success factors for innovation and creativity.

The innovations at RTL Group are focused on three core
topics: continuously developing and acquiring new, high-
quality TV content and formats; using all digital means of
distribution; and expanding diverse forms of advertising
sales and monetization. New and innovative TV formats
include the show “Lost in Time,” an interactive production
by Fremantle Media Norge, in which special effects and
reality are combined in real time. In addition, RTL Group
invested in virtual reality for the first time and initiated the
latest round of investments of the Israeli start-up Inception
VR. RTL Group is also pursuing an ambitious growth plan for
its advertising technology business. The primary objective
is to create a global, independent monetization platform for
channels, video-on-demand services and content providers.
For example, SpotX and Smartclip are to be merged to form
an integrated advertising technology company by the end
of 2018. The focus here is mainly on adressable TV, which
means that advertising can be targeted at TV households via

linear television based on criteria such as income and age.
Synergy committees are used for exchanging information
and knowledge within RTL Group.

Innovations at Penguin Random House are related to the
areas of content and distribution. They are central to forging
direct relationships with millions of readers by utilizing the
platforms to market the books and authors. As one example,
subscribers worldwide receive regular e-mail updates from
the publishers on early cover reveals, advance excerpts,
sweepstakes, author appearances and more. With the
novel “Wonder,” the company is capitalizing on the theat-
trical release of the film adaptation by experimenting with
large-scale merchandising through new retail channels and
promotional partnerships with film production companies in
an effort to convert fans of the movie to purchasers of the
book. An example of innovation in partnership with new and
emerging technology is the Penguin Young Readers’ imprint
collaboration with both Google and Amazon to make the
app Mad Libs accessible on their respective voice assistants.

The innovations at Gruner + Jahr included digital marketing
and the expansion of the brand business and the existing
magazine division. The strong growth of the digital business
was generated above all by the significantly increased adver-
tising revenues from brand websites and the strong growth
of the app recommendation platform AppLike, although
Germany's food community Chefkoch also continued to grow.
G+J expanded its brand-related activities with furniture from
the “Schoner Wohnen” collection. In 2017 innovative magazines
were launched such as the interior design magazine “Ideat.”
The publishing house Deutsche Medien-Manufaktur founded
by Gruner + Jahr and Landwirtschaftsverlag successfully
launched “Hygge.”

The innovations at BMG are driven by the company’s artist-
and songwriter-friendly approach encompassing everything
from contracts to administration, marketing and finance,
and reflecting its core values of Fairness, Transparency and
Service. An example of this came in 2017 with the launch of
a mobile app to allow songwriters 24/7 access to their royalty
information via their mobile phones. A version tailored to
the needs of recording artists will be released during 2018.
Powerful endorsement for BMG’s innovative technology
came with the decision of the TV Content Streaming Service
Netflix to move the administration of its music publishing
rights to BMG.

The innovations at Arvato were introduced in all four solution
groups and primarily concern the use of innovative tech-
nologies, development and implementation of new ser-
vice offerings, and investment in innovative companies. In

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2017 9


--- Page 7 ---

CRM Solutions, Arvato used new technologies such as ana-
lytics, machine learning and chatbots to optimize the service
experience. In the SCM Solutions business area, data goggles
and driverless transport systems are increasingly used. Arvato
Financial Solutions worked on innovative cloud solutions to
combat fraud in the healthcare and e-commerce sectors.
Moreover, in the financial year 2017 Arvato again invested in
innovative companies in the fintech and analytics sectors.

The innovations of the Bertelsmann Printing Group in 2017
again are mainly in improving technology and processes and
in developing and marketing new products and services. With
the production of the innovative Ultra HD Blu-ray data carrier,
Sonopress was one of the pioneers in developing a growth
market. In recognition of this, the company received the Digital
Product Innovation Award at the start of the year from the US
industrial association Digital Entertainment Group. Other inno-
vation projects focused on 3-D scanning and the integration of
augmented reality markers in books, magazines and catalogs.

The innovations at Bertelsmann Education Group mainly
consist of the further development of digital and customized
education offerings and the expansion of existing business
areas. For example, Relias expanded its expertise in analytics
and performance management in order to provide more
data-based support to customers in the healthcare sector in
improving performance within companies. At the same time,
Relias developed a large number of online courses in the United
States and expanded the range of courses being offered in
the United Kingdom, Germany and China. Udacity developed
new Nanodegree programs, including deep learning, digital
marketing and software development for robotics, thus
setting further standards in student qualifications for future
technology jobs.

Report on Economic Position

Corporate Environment
Overall Economic Developments

The expansion of the global economy noticeably accelerated
in 2017. Real GDP increased by 3.8 percent compared to
3.1 percent in 2016. Global economic growth was more broadly
based and global trading increased significantly once more.

The economic upturn in the eurozone remains solid. Real GDP

grew by 2.5 percent in 2017 compared to 1.7 percent in the
previous year. The growth was supported by the increase in

10 Financial Information Combined Management Report

private consumer spending and investments and by exports
that benefited from increasing global trading.

The German economy is seeing a strong upturn. Real GDP grew
by 2.2 percent compared to 1.9 percent in the previous year.
In France too, the economic situation showed steady improve-
ment. Real GDP growth was 1.9 percent in 2017 compared to
1.1 percent in 2016. In the United Kingdom, economic activ-
ity slowed as a result of Brexit with an increase in real GDP of
1.7 percent, compared to a rise of 1.9 percent in the previous year.

The US economy proved to be robust, backed by solid domes-
tic demand. Real GDP grew by 2.3 percent in 2017 compared
to 1.9 percent in 2016.

Developments in Relevant Markets

The following analysis focuses on markets and regions that
are of a sufficient size and that are strategically important from
a Group perspective.

The majority of the European TV advertising markets saw
stable or declining development in 2017. While the develop-
ment of the TV advertising markets in Germany, France and
Spain was largely stable, the TV advertising markets in the
Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary and Croatia saw a moderate
to significant decline.

The markets for printed books achieved slightly positive
growth overall in 2017. Sales of printed books in the United
States and sales in Spain grew slightly, while sales of printed
books were stable in the United Kingdom and fell slightly in
Germany. Publishing sales of e-books in the United States and
the United Kingdom continued to decline, although sales of
audio downloads recorded strong growth.

The magazine markets in Germany and France in 2017 were
characterized by strongly declining print advertising business
and significantly declining circulation business, while the digi-
tal business posted strong growth.

The global music markets in 2017 reported moderate growth
in the publishing rights market segment. The recording rights
market segment grew significantly.

The key service markets for Arvato, namely Customer
Relationship Management, Supply Chain Management,
Financial Solutions and IT, saw moderate to significant growth.

The European offset printing markets showed stable develop-
ment in 2017, while the European gravure printing markets


--- Page 8 ---

declined significantly. The development of the North American
book printing market was stable over the same period.

The education markets in the United States continued to
grow strongly overall in 2017 in the market segments where
Bertelsmann is involved — namely, healthcare and technology,
university education and online services.

Significant Events in the Financial Year

At the end of January 2017, BMG took over the BBR Music
Group, which includes well-known country music labels such
as Broken Bow Records, Stoney Creek Records, Wheelhouse
Records and the music publisher Magic Mustang Music. The
takeover also included the rights to many well-known country
music artists.

In July 2017, Penguin Random House acquired the publishing
business Ediciones B from Spain's Grupo Zeta media group,
which as part of the Spanish-speaking Penguin Random House
Grupo Editorial, strengthens the publishing businesses in
Spain and Latin America.

Fernando Carro resigned from the Executive Board of
Bertelsmann Management SE effective July 13, 2017. The posi-
tion of Arvato CEO represented on the Bertelsmann Executive
Board has not yet been filled. Since then, CEO Thomas Rabe
and CFO Bernd Hirsch have been jointly managing the Arvato
division.

In October 2017, RTL Group acquired the remaining shares
of SpotX Inc. by exercising a call option. RTL Group thus

Revenues by Division

continued to expand its advertising technology business. The
full takeover of SpotX enables a stronger integration with the
European online video advertising company Smartclip and the
creation of a comprehensive advertising technology hub to
support the marketing solutions for RTL businesses.

In October 2017, Bertelsmann increased its stake in Penguin
Random House to a strategic three-quarters majority by acquir-
ing a further 22 percent from Pearson, the British media and
education company. Through this acquisition, Bertelsmann
gained greater governance rights at Penguin Random House
and will in the future appoint the chairman of the board of
directors, among other things. Pearson remains a co-share-
holder of Penguin Random House with a share of 25 percent.

In December 2017, RTL Group sold three adjoining buildings in
Paris that were previously used by RTL Radio France. The sale
proceeds amount to €114 million; the capital gain is €94 million.

growth of 1.7 percent, adjusted for exchange rate and port-
folio effects. The exchange rate effects were -1.0 percent and
the portfolio effects were 0.7 percent.

Revenues at RTL Group rose 2.2 percent to €6,373 million
(previous year: €6,237 million). The organic growth was
1.8 percent. The positive development was mainly gener-
ated by the German and French TV businesses and the
continued expansion of digital activities. Revenues at
Penguin Random House remained stable at €3,359 million
(previous year: €3,361 million). Negative exchange rate effects
were largely offset by portfolio effects. At €1,513 million,
Gruner + Jahr’s revenues were down 4.2 percent year on
year (previous year: €1,580 million). The organic growth was
-1.6 percent. The revenue decline stems largely from the
portfolio effects of disposals. Revenues at BMG increased by
21.8 percent to €507 million (previous year: €416 million) as a
result of further acquisitions and organic business expansion.
The organic growth was 18.5 percent. Revenues at Arvato rose
1.6 percent to €3,823 million (previous year: €3,763 million). The
organic growth was 2.9 percent. This was primarily the result
of the growth of business with new and existing customers at
SCM Solutions. Revenues at Bertelsmann Printing Group fell
1.6 percent to €1,681 million (previous year: €1,709 million)
due to market and exchange rate effects. The organic growth
was -1.0 percent. Bertelsmann Education Group increased
its revenues by 32.6 percent to €189 million (previous year:
€142 million). The organic growth was 12.5 percent. The
rise was primarily the result of the organic and acquisitive
expansion of Relias. None of the investments of Bertelsmann
Investments are fully consolidated.

There were only minor changes in the geographical break-
down of revenues compared to the previous year. The share of
revenues generated in Germany was 34.0 percent compared
to 34.6 percent in the previous year. The revenue share gen-
erated by France amounted to 13.4 percent (previous year:
13.2 percent). In the United Kingdom, the revenue share was
6.8 percent (previous year: 6.4 percent). The share of total rev-
enues generated by the other European countries amounted to
18.7 percent compared to 18.3 percent in the previous year. The

revenue share generated by the United States was 20.5 percent
(previous year: 20.8 percent), and the other countries achieved
a revenue share of 6.6 percent (previous year: 6.7 percent). This
means that the share of total revenues generated by foreign
business was 66.0 percent (previous year: 65.4 percent). Year
on year, there was a slight change in the ratio of the four rev-
enue sources (own products and merchandise, advertising,
services, rights and licenses) to overall revenue.

The revenue share generated by the growth businesses
increased to 32 percent overall (previous year: 30 percent),
thanks to organic growth and acquisitions, while the revenue
share of structurally declining businesses remained stable at
4 percent (previous year: 4 percent). The growth businesses
comprise those activities that post continuous revenue
increases due to sustained positive market factors and that
have been identified as growth priorities as part of Group
strategy. These include the digital businesses of RTL Group
and Gruner + Jahr; the TV production, music business and
service businesses in the Arvato divisions of SCM Solutions
and Financial Solutions and Systems; the education business,
and the fund activities. The structurally declining businesses
comprise those activities that post sustained revenue losses
due to market factors. These include in particular the gravure
printing activities and the storage media replication business.

Operating EBITDA

Bertelsmann achieved a 2.7 percent increase in operating
EBITDA to €2,636 million in the financial year 2017 (previous
year: €2,568 million). In particular, RTL Group, BMG and
Bertelsmann Education Group achieved a good earnings per-
formance. The operating EBITDA includes start-up losses for
digital and new businesses, which for Bertelsmann Education
Group and RTL Group alone totaled €-69 million (previous year:
€-71 million). The EBITDA margin increased to 15.3 percent
(previous year: 15.2 percent).

Operating EBITDA at RTL Group rose 5.2 percent to €1,478 million
(previous year: €1,405 million). In particular, Mediengruppe RTL
Deutschland and Fremantle Media posted earnings increases.
The earnings figure for RTL Group also includes a profit from the
sale of buildings in Paris previously used by RTL Radio France.
Operating EBITDA at Penguin Random House declined by
2.9 percent to €521 million (previous year: €537 million), particu-
larly as a result of negative exchange rate effects. Gruner + Jahr's
operating EBITDA increased by 6.2 percent to €145 million
(previous year: €137 million). A strong rise in earnings at G+J
Deutschland, attributable among other things to the development
of digital businesses and positive portfolio effects from dispos-
als, was contrasted by lower contributions to earnings in France.
BMG'‘s operating EBITDA rose by 9.5 percent to €104 million

(previous year: €95 million), thanks to the continued develop-
ment of the business. Operating EBITDA at Arvato declined by
10.0 percent to €320 million (previous year: €356 million). The
lower earnings resulted primarily from a fall in the volume of
CRM business within the telecommunications sector and from
higher start-up losses for new businesses. Operating EBITDA
at Bertelsmann Printing Group declined by 2.3 percent to
€118 million (previous year: €121 million) due to the persistently
declining print market and as a result of negative exchange rate
effects. Operating EBITDA at Bertelsmann Education Group
increased to €3 million (previous year: €-17 million). This is pri-
marily attributable to the organic growth of Relias. This includes
proportional start-up losses from Group investments that are
not fully consolidated. None of the investments of Bertelsmann
Investments are fully consolidated; therefore, in most cases no
operating results are disclosed for this segment.

Special Items

Special items in the financial year 2017 totaled €-83 million
compared to €-139 million in the previous year. They consist
of reversals on impairments and impairment losses totaling
€-100 million (previous year: €-26 million), adjustments of car-
rying amounts of assets held for sale of €-4 million (previous
year: €-14 million), fair value remeasurement of investments
of €15 million (previous year: €12 million), results from

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2017 B


--- Page 11 ---

disposals of investments totaling €182 million (previous year:
€41 million), and restructuring expenses and other adjust-
ments totaling €-176 million (previous year: €-152 million)
(see also the reconciliation of EBIT to operating EBITDA in the
notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Results from
disposals of investments were characterized by gains on dis-
posals at Bertelsmann Investments.

EBIT

EBIT amounted to €1,896 million in the financial year 2017
(previous year: €1,799 million) after adjusting operating
EBITDA for special items totaling €-83 million (previous year:
€-139 million) and the amortization, depreciation, impair-
ments and reversals of impairments on intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment totaling €-657 million (previous
year: €-630 million), which were not included in adjustments.

Group Profit or Loss

The financial result improved to €-219 million compared to the
previous year's figure of €-244 million. The income tax expenses
came to €-472 million compared to €-419 million in the previous
year, in particular due to the improved earnings before taxes
from continuing operations and due to burdens in connection
with the US tax reform. This produced earnings after taxes
from continuing operations of €1,205 million (previous year:
€1,136 million). Taking into account the earnings after taxes
from discontinued operations of €-7 million (previous year:
€1 million), this resulted in a Group profit of €1,198 million
(previous year: €1,137 million). The share of Group profit
held by non-controlling interests came to €422 million
(previous year: €451 million). The share of Group profit held by
Bertelsmann shareholders increased to €776 million (previous
year: €686 million), particularly as a result of the shareholding
increase in Penguin Random House. At the Annual General
Meeting of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA, an unchanged year-
on-year dividend payout of €180 million will be proposed for
the financial year 2017 (previous year: €180 million).

Net Assets and Financial Position
Financing Guidelines

The primary objective of Bertelsmann’s financial policy

is to achieve a balance between financial security, return
on equity and growth. For this, Bertelsmann bases its

4 Financial Information Combined Management Report

financing policy on the requirements of a “Baa1/BBB+” credit
rating and the associated qualitative and quantitative crite-
ria. Credit ratings and capital market transparency make a
considerable contribution to the company’s financial secu-
rity and independence.

In accordance with the Group structure, the capital allo-
cation is made centrally by Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA,
which provides the Group companies with liquidity and
manages the issuance of guarantees and letters of comfort
for them. The Group consists largely of a single financial
unit, thereby optimizing capital procurement and invest-
ment opportunities.

Bertelsmann utilizes a financial control system employing
quantitative financial targets concerning the Group's eco-
nomic debt and, to a lesser extent, its capital structure. One
of the financial targets is a dynamic leverage factor limited
to the defined maximum of 2.5. As of December 31, 2017,
the leverage factor of Bertelsmann was 2.5, (December 31,
2016: 2.5), which is in line with the previous year's level
(see further explanation in the “Alternative Performance
Measures” section).

As of December 31, 2017, economic debt increased to
€6,213 million from €5,913 million in the previous year, due
to an increase in net financial debt. The latter increase to
€3,479 million (December 31, 2016: €2,625 million) is largely
attributable to the financing of the shareholding increase in
Penguin Random House. Provisions for pensions and similar
obligations fell to €1,685 million as of December 31, 2017
(December 31, 2016: €1,999 million), due to an increase in
the interest rate.

Another financial target is the coverage ratio. This is calcu-
lated as the ratio of operating EBITDA (after modifications)
to financial result, which is used to determine the leverage
factor and is supposed to be above four. In the reporting
period, the coverage ratio was 11.2 (previous year: 9.7). The
Group's equity ratio was 38.5 percent (December 31, 2016:
41.6 percent), which remains significantly above the self-
imposed minimum of 25 percent. The decline is attributable
to the purchase price payments for increases in sharehold-
ings in the companies that are already fully consolidated,
Penguin Random House and Spot, as well as from dividend
distributions to non-controlling interests, which also include
the special dividend paid to the co-shareholder as part of the
shareholding increase in Penguin Random House.

Financing Activities

In May 2017, Bertelsmann placed a bond with a four-year
term and an issue volume of €500 million. The bond, which
is listed in Luxembourg, has a fixed 0.25 percent coupon.
In addition, Bertelsmann issued in the form of private place-
ments in July 2017 a bond in the amount of €50 million with a
seven-year term and in August 2017 a promissory note in the
amount of €150 million with a term of a year and a half. The
proceeds from the placements were primarily used to finance
the shareholding increase in Penguin Random House.

Rating

Bertelsmann has been rated by the rating agencies Moody's
and Standard & Poor's (S&P) since 2002. The agency ratings
facilitate access to the international capital markets and are
therefore a key element of Bertelsmann’s financial security.
Bertelsmann is rated by Moody's as “Baa1” (outlook: stable)
and by S&P as “BBB+” (outlook: stable). Both credit ratings
are in the investment-grade category and meet Bertelsmann's
target rating. Bertelsmann’s short-term credit quality rating is
“P-2" from Moody's and “A-2” from S&P.

Credit Facilities

As well as its existing liquidity, the Bertelsmann Group has
access to a syndicated loan agreement with major interna-
tional banks. This forms the backbone of the strategic credit
reserve; Bertelsmann can utilize this with a term until 2021 to
draw up to €1.2 billion of revolving funds in euros, US dollars
and pounds sterling.

Cash Flow Statement

In the reporting period, Bertelsmann generated net cash
from operating activities of €1,642 million (previous year:
€1,954 million). The Group's long-term operating free cash flow
adjusted for non-recurring items was €1,822 million (previous
year: €1,799 million), and the cash conversion rate was
92 percent (previous year: 93 percent); see also “Broadly Defined
Performance Indicators” section. The cash flow from investing
activities was €-797 million (previous year: €-1,081 million). This
included investments in intangible assets, property, plant and
equipment, and financial assets of €-890 million (previous year:
€-962 million). The purchase price payments for consolidated
investments (net of acquired cash and cash equivalents) were

€-755 million (previous year: €-793 million). Dividends paid
to the shareholders of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA remained
unchanged at €-180 million (previous year: €-180 million).
Dividends to non-controlling interests and further payments
to partners in partnerships came to €-743 million (previous
year: €-388 million). This figure includes a special dividend of
€373 million paid to the co-shareholder as part of the shareholding
increase in Penguin Random House. As of December 31, 2017,
Bertelsmann had cash and cash equivalents of €1.4 billion
(previous year: €1.4 billion).

Off-Balance-Sheet Liabilities

The off-balance-sheet liabilities include contingent liabilities and
other financial commitments, almost all of which result from
operating activities conducted by the divisions. Off-balance
sheet liabilities declined year on year. The off-balance-sheet
liabilities in place as of December 31, 2017, had no significant
negative effects on the Group's net assets, financial position and
results of operation for the past or for the future financial year.

Investments

Total investments including financial debt acquired of €14 million
(previous year: €6 million) amounted to €1.117 million in the
financial year 2017 (previous year: €1,244 million). Invest-
ments according to the cash flow statement amounted to
€1,103 million (previous year: €1,240 million). As in previous
years, the majority of the €360 million investment in property,
plant and equipment (previous year: €326 million) stemmed
from Arvato. Investments in intangible assets came to
€319 million (previous year: €388 million) and were primarily
attributable to RTL Group for investments in film rights and
to BMG for the acquisition of music catalogs. The sum of
€211 million was invested in financial assets (previous year:
€248 million). These include, in particular, the investments of
Bertelsmann Investments. Purchase price payments for con-
solidated investments (less acquired cash and cash equiva-
lents) totaled €213 million in the reporting period (previous
year: €278 million) and were attributable, among other things,
to BMG's acquisition of BBR Music Group.

Taking into account purchase price payments for increases
in shareholdings in companies that are already fully con-
solidated, in particular for the shareholding increase in
Penguin Random House and the acquisition of SpotX, the
economic investments in the financial year 2017 increased to
€1,776 million in total (previous year: €1,262 million). Accord-
ing to IFRS, these payments for increases in shareholdings
are classified as change in equity and allocated to cash flow
from financing activities. From a company point of view, these
payments are, in substance, comparable to purchase price
payments for consolidated investments and are thus consid-
ered as investments.

Balance Sheet

Total assets amounted to €23.7 billion as of December 31,
2017 (previous year: €23.8 billion). Cash and cash equiva-
lents amounted to €1.4 billion (previous year: €1.4 billion).
Equity declined to €9.1 billion (previous year: €9.9 billion).


--- Page 14 ---

The decline is primarily attributable to changes in equity
due to the shareholding increase in Penguin Random House
and the payment of a special dividend to the co-share-
holder. This resulted in a decrease of the equity ratio to
38.5 percent (previous year: 41.6 percent). Equity attributable
to Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA shareholders was €7.8 billion
(previous year: €7.9 billion). Provisions for pensions and similar
obligations fell to €1,685 million (previous year: €1,999 million)
due to an increase in the interest rate. Gross financial debt
increased to €4,919 million compared to €3,998 million as of
December 31, 2016, due to the taking up of financial debt as
reported in the “Financing Activities” section. Apart from that,
the balance sheet structure remained largely unchanged from
the previous year.

Profit Participation Capital

Profit participation capital had a par value of €301 million as
of December 31, 2017, which is unchanged from the previous
year. If the effective interest method is applied, the carrying
amount of profit participation capital was €413 million as of
December 31, 2017 (previous year: €413 million). The 2001
profit participation certificates (ISIN DEQ005229942) account
for 94 percent of par value of profit participation capital, while
the 1992 profit participation certificates (ISIN DE0005229900)
account for the remaining 6 percent.

The 2001 profit participation certificates are officially listed
for trading on the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange. Their price is listed as a percentage of par value.

The lowest closing rate of the 2001 profit participation certifi-
cates in the financial year 2017 was 316.00 percent in January;
their highest was 339.40 percent in November.

Under the terms and conditions of the 2001 profit participation
certificates, the payout for each full financial year is 15 percent
of par value, subject to the availability of sufficient Group profit
and net income at the level of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA.
These conditions were met in the past financial year. Accord-
ingly, a payout of 15 percent of the notional value of the 2001
profit participation certificates will also be made for the finan-
cial year 2017.

The 1992 profit participation certificates, approved for trading
on the Regulated Market in Frankfurt, only have a limited cash
trade due to their low volume. Payouts on the 1992 profit
participation certificates are based on the Group's return on
total assets. As the return on total assets for the financial
year 2017 was 7.73 percent (previous year: 7.09 percent),
the payout on the 1992 profit participation certificates for the
financial year 2017 will be 8.73 percent of their notional value
(previous year: 8.09 percent).

The payout distribution date for both profit participation cer-
tificates is expected to be May 15, 2018. Under the terms and
conditions of the profit participation certificates, the auditors
appointed by Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA are responsible for
verifying whether amounts to be distributed have been calcu-
lated correctly. The auditors of both profit participation certifi-
cates provide confirmation of this.

Performance of the Group Divisions
RTL Group

RTL Group once again delivered a very gratifying business
performance in 2017. The main drivers were Mediengruppe
RTL Deutschland and the French Groupe M6, which managed
to increase their advertising revenues in their respective stable
TV advertising markets. Rapidly growing digital businesses
also contributed to the positive business performance.
RTL Group’s ad-tech business was expanded by the full
takeover of the online video ad-serving platform SpotX. SpotX
and Smartclip started merging into an integrated ad-tech
powerhouse. RTL Group expanded its presence on numerous
online platforms as part of its “Total Video” strategy, and saw
strong growth in online video views.

Against this backdrop, RTL Group's revenues increased by
2.2 percent to a record €6.4 billion (previous year: €6.2 billion).
Operating EBITDA also reached a new record, rising 5.2 percent
to €1.5 billion (previous year: €1.4 billion). A positive one-off
effect from the sale of commercial real estate in France and
a higher contribution to earnings from Mediengruppe RTL
Deutschland and RTL Group’s production arm Fremantle
Media contributed to this. The EBITDA margin increased to
23.2 percent after 22.5 percent in the previous year.

Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland once again ended the finan-
cial year with record revenues and earnings. This was fueled
by higher advertising revenues from the TV and digital busi-
ness, as well as growing platform revenues. The combined
average audience share of the family of channels increased to
28.9 percent in the main target group (2016: 28.7 percent). At
the same time, the group significantly widened its lead over
its biggest commercial competitor to 4.5 percentage points
(previous year: 3.4 percentage points).

In France, Groupe M6 grew its revenues with higher TV adver-
tising revenues and the first-time consolidation of French
cashback market leader iGraal. Earnings decreased slightly
as the previous year’s result had included the positive one-
off effect from the gradual expiration of a mobile telephony
agreement. RTL Group merged its French radio business,
RTL Radio (France), with Groupe M6 in October, enabling a
strengthening of its commercial offering as well as program
and cost synergies. Groupe M6 achieved a combined TV audi-
ence share of 22.3 percent in the main target group (previous
year: 22.2 percent). RTL Nederland recorded decreased adver-
tising revenues during the reporting period, resulting in lower
revenues and earnings.

Fremantle Media reported slightly lower revenues for 2017
due to negative exchange rate effects, but increased its oper-
ating result as a result of higher profit contributions from
North America and Europe. Its greatest creative successes

included the fantasy series “American Gods,” which was pro-
duced by Fremantle Media North America for the US cable
channel Starz and has also been available to more than 200
territories since May 2017 through Amazon Prime Video, and
UFA Fiction’s historical drama series “Charité,” produced for
Das Erste in Germany.

RTL Group continued to invest in its three strategic pillars
of broadcasting, content and digital and, in addition to tak-
ing full ownership of SpotX, acquired a minority stake in the
Israeli virtual-reality company Inception. Mediengruppe RTL
Deutschland secured important sports rights to Formula 1
motor racing and UEFA Europa League soccer matches.

Penguin Random House

For Penguin Random House, the 2017 financial year was
dominated by changes in the ownership structure, a strong
bestseller performance and an expansion of the business in
the Spanish-language territories. Bertelsmann increased its
shareholding in Penguin Random House to a strategic three-
quarters majority in October by acquiring another 22 percent
from co-shareholder Pearson, thereby strengthening its
governance rights. The operating business benefited from
hundreds of national and international bestsellers. “Wonder”
by R.J. Palacio, its biggest-selling title in 2017 in the United
States, received additional impetus through a movie adapta-
tion and sold close to five million copies in print and e-book
formats in its English-speaking territories. While print book
revenues remained broadly stable overall, and e-book sales
declined moderately, Penguin Random House again recorded
strong growth in digital audiobooks. In 2017, the book group
continued to expand its direct-to-consumer outreach to
readers, and also acquired the world publishing rights for two
books by former US President Barack Obama and former First
Lady Michelle Obama.

Inclusive of Verlagsgruppe Random House, the German
publishing group wholly owned by Bertelsmann, Penguin
Random House achieved stable revenues of €3.4 billion in
2017 (previous year: €3.4 billion, -0.1 percent). Negative
exchange rate effects were largely offset by portfolio effects.
The book group's operating EBITDA declined by 2.9 percent
to €521 million (previous year: €537 million) due to exchange
rate effects. The EBITDA margin once again reached the high
level of 15.5 percent (previous year: 16.0 percent).

In the United States, Penguin Random House publishers
placed 461 titles on the “New York Times” bestseller lists last
year, including 61 at number one. In addition to R.J. Palacio’s
“Wonder,” the year's major successes included “Origin” by
Dan Brown, “Camino Island” and “The Rooster Bar” by John
Grisham and “Into the Water” by Paula Hawkins. Almost
ten million copies of children’s book classics by Dr. Seuss
were sold.

In the United Kingdom, Penguin Random House UK publishers
recorded growth. Titles published by Penguin Random House
UK publishers achieved a 43 percent share of “The Sunday
Times” top 10 weekly bestseller lists. Top sellers included
“5 Ingredients” by Jamie Oliver, “Origin” by Dan Brown, and
“Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Getaway” by Jeff Kinney.

Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial also increased its rev-
enues, benefiting from strong frontlist and backlist sales, which
more than offset declining economic development in several
Latin American countries. With the acquisition of Ediciones B
in July, Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial enhanced

its position as the largest publisher in Latin America and its
market position in Spain. Its bestselling titles in 2017 were
“Una Columna de Fuego” (“A Column of Fire”) by Ken Follett and
“Mas alla del invierno” (“In the Midst of Winter”) by Isabel Allende.

In Germany, notwithstanding the industry-wide impact of
declining consumer traffic in bookstores, Verlagsgruppe
Random House maintains its market-leading position. The
publishing group had 401 titles on the “Spiegel” bestseller
lists, including 22 at number one. “Die Geschichte der Bienen”
(“The History of Bees”) by Maja Lunde was the bestselling
book in Germany in 2017.

Penguin Random House authors were honored with numer-
ous major international literary awards. Kazuo Ishiguro, who is
published by Penguin Random House, won the Nobel Prize in
Literature. The publishing group’s authors also received four
Pulitzer Prizes, two Man Booker Awards, and a US National
Book Award.

Gruner + Jahr

Gruner + Jahr achieved a significantly higher operating result,
attributable mainly to the growing German business. Revenues
fell by 4.2 percent to €1.5 billion (previous year: €1.6 billion),
due to portfolio adjustments, notably the sale of the publish-
ing activities in Spain and Austria. However, growing digital
revenues and new business, including new magazines, had
a positive impact on earnings. Operating EBITDA improved
by 6.2 percent to €145 million (previous year: €137 million),
causing the EBITDA margin to rise to 9.6 percent (previous
year: 8.7 percent).

G+J grew both its revenues and earnings in Germany. The
decline in the print ad-sales business, which was slight com-
pared to the rest of the market, was offset by surging digital
revenues. The German sales business also grew in total.

The fast-growing digital business was a major contributor to
the good business performance in Germany. The digital share
of total revenues in the German core market rose to over a
quarter. The AppLike marketing platform, founded in 2016,
experienced strong growth. G+J’s most successful online
offerings, such as the “Chefkoch” community and the jour-
nalistic flagships “Stern,” “Gala” and “Brigitte,” each achieved
record reach and revenues in the 2017 financial year.

As in previous years, there were several new magazine launches
in 2017, such as “Ideat,” “Hygge” and “Cord.” Another posi-
tive contributor were the activities of the Ad Alliance jointly
formed by RTL subsidiary IP Deutschland and G+J eMS, which
develops cross-genre advertising concepts. “Der Spiegel” was
added last year. The content communication agency Territory
did well, and the DDV Media Group had a stable financial year
in terms of revenues and earnings.

G+J France’s business was dominated by moderate declines
in revenues. The earnings fell sharply. In particular, the print
advertising business and individual digital businesses came
under pressure, including the digital video ad marketer
“Advideum.” The journalistic digital offerings of the classic
magazine brands such as “Voici,” “Gala” and “Femme
actuelle” significantly increased their reach and sales, mainly
due to growing revenues in the mobile and video segment. In
sum, digital revenues rose year on year.

BMG

Bertelsmann’s music subsidiary BMG significantly grew its
publishing and recorded-music business in 2017, expanded
its scope to include audiovisual content and continued its
international expansion. BMG benefited from the acquisition
of the country label BBR Music Group, from prominent artist
signings and chart successes, and a continuing upturn in the
recorded music industry fueled by streaming and new emerg-
ing markets.

BMG's revenues increased by 21.8 percent to €507 million
(previous year: €416 million). This is attributable to higher rev-
enues across all market segments and regions through organic
growth and acquisition, especially in the recorded music busi-
ness and in the British, US and Australian publishing business.
Operating EBITDA also increased due to organic and acquisition
derived growth, rising by 9.5 percent to €104 million (previous
year: €95 million). This development was driven by the record-
ing business in the United States as well as by the publishing
business in the United Kingdom and United States. The EBITDA
margin was 20.5 percent (previous year: 22.8 percent).

BMG expanded its portfolio with a series of purchases and
catalog acquisitions. In January, the company acquired the
BBR Music Group, which includes the country music labels
Broken Bow Records, Stoney Creek Records and Wheelhouse
Records, as well as the music publisher Magic Mustang
Music. The deal secures BMG a significant position in the
country music capital of Nashville — and thus in the lucrative
country music market. In September, Chrissie Hynde, founder
and singer of the British rock band The Pretenders, entrusted
her entire song catalog to BMG. In the recorded-music busi-
ness, BMG added Nickelback, Morrissey, Avril Lavigne, Fergie,
Kylie Minogue and the rapper Kontra K to its artist roster. Fur-
ther expansion of the recorded music business was accom-
panied by a strong showing in music publishing, with BMG
songwriters responsible for each of the top three songs in the
Billboard Hot 100 for 13 consecutive weeks in summer 2017.

The company has strengthened its international footprint with
enhanced representation in Canada and an expansion of its
activities in China, including an innovative partnership with
mobile social network Momo to develop Chinese talent with
the help of BMG songwriters.

BMG extended the range of services it offers to artists with
an entry into the movie and television business. Its first major
production — a documentary about Joan Jett — was selected
to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. Moreover, BMG
grouped its production music interests into a new interna-
tional business unit, focused on commissioning and market-
ing the rights to music specifically produced for movies, radio,
the Internet, video games and advertising.

BMG concluded significant partnership agreements with
several major entertainment providers in the reporting period.
The company now manages the music publishing rights of
RTL Group’s content production arm Fremantle Media, the
streaming provider Netflix and the production company Amblin
Partners, founded by Hollywood legend Steven Spielberg.

BMG also developed a mobile application called myBMG,
which gives artists and songwriters a 24/7 overview of their
constantly updated royalty information.

Arvato

Arvato posted a stable revenue performance and a decline
in the operating result in 2017. Arvato’s revenues rose by
1.6 percent to €3.8 billion (previous year: €3.8 billion). Espe-
cially due to challenges in individual markets and sectors
as well as high start-up costs for new business, operating
EBITDA in the reporting period was down by 10.0 percent to
€320 million (previous year: €356 million). The EBITDA margin
was 8.4 percent, after 9.5 percent in the previous year.

In July 2017, Bertelsmann Chairman and CEO Thomas Rabe
and Bertelsmann CFO Bernd Hirsch took over the manage-
ment of the Arvato division.

Revenues of the Solution Group Arvato CRM Solutions grew
slightly in the financial year, but its earnings declined. The
main reasons for this were declining business volumes in the
telecommunications sector, start-up costs for new clients
and the expansion of business with international companies
from the IT/high-tech sector. The international network was
expanded with the opening of new offices, including in the
Philippines and Senegal.

Arvato SCM Solutions massively expanded its global logistics
network in the past financial year, reflecting its good order-book
situation. In Germany, the United States, France, Austria and
Poland, new distribution centers took up operations and some
existing sites were expanded, including in the Netherlands and
Germany. The Solution Group also expanded its services busi-
nesses, primarily in the core sectors of e-commerce, fashion &
beauty, and healthcare, and significantly strengthened its
North American business by taking over US deliveries for a
major high-tech client. The start-up costs for these new busi-
ness activities impacted earnings.

Arvato Financial Solutions’ financial services businesses did
well in terms of both revenues and earnings. Its continued
positive business performance was fueled primarily by the
steadily growing business in the core market of Germany. To
expand the service portfolio in the innovative fintech sector,
Arvato Financial Solutions began a collaboration with Solaris
Bank. In addition, the shareholding in the Brazilian financial
services company Intervalor was increased from 41.5 percent
to 81.5 percent.

Demand for Arvato Systems’ IT services remained high in
2017. To sustainably meet this demand, a nearshore site in
Riga was opened, among other things. The expansion of busi-
ness activities in the field of healthcare IT was successfully
advanced, and further investments were made in emerging
fields such as solutions for the smart-energy market and cloud
services. In particular, the project costs for expanding the
cloud capabilities had a negative impact on earnings.

Bertelsmann Printing Group

In the 2017 financial year, the Bertelsmann Printing Group
recorded a slight decline in revenue to €1.7 billion (previous
year: €1.7 billion, -1.6 percent) and in operating EBITDA, which
dipped slightly by 2.3 percent to €118 million (previous year:
€121 million). The reason for these changes is the continu-
ing decline in the printing market. At 7.0 percent, the Group's
EBITDA margin is on par with the previous year’s level of
7.1 percent.

The Bertelsmann Printing Group's offset printing business
grew slightly in the 2017 financial year, and achieved a good
result. Mohn Media was able to renew important customer
contracts during the course of the year, including in the retail
sector. GGP Media, a company specializing in print solutions
for book publishers, successfully defended its position in a
competitive market environment, as did the BPG subsidiary
Vogel Druck, which specializes in magazines and catalogs
with small to medium-size print runs.

The gravure printing activities bundled in the Prinovis Group
declined slightly overall due to difficult market conditions. In
the United Kingdom, the business with the major custom-
ers acquired in 2016 was expanded. The German Prinovis
sites suffered from chronic volume declines, especially in
the magazine segment. This decline was countered by an
extensive efficiency and cost reduction program, which was
completed at the three German sites during the course of
the year.

The Bertelsmann Printing Group's US printing companies
faced intense competition in the book printing business.
Significant declines in paperback production were at least
partially offset by an expansion of the business outside the
publishing sector. The US printers’ operating results were
below the previous year’s level.

Revenues at Sonopress rose slightly despite difficult market
conditions in Mexico. At the Gtitersloh headquarters, the com-
pany once again bucked the overall market trend by increas-
ing its production volumes, revenues and earnings. Among
other things, this development is due to sales successes, also
as a result of further market consolidation in Europe. During
the year under review, Sonopress also further expanded the
production of UHD Blu-ray discs.

The print-related marketing services businesses, which were
assigned to the Bertelsmann Printing Group since January 2017,
offer cross-channel communication services, especially for
the retail segment. These businesses showed a stable overall
development due to, among other things, the expansion of
digital direct-marketing solutions and the extension of impor-
tant customer contracts.

Bertelsmann Education Group

Bertelsmann’s education holdings, pooled in the Bertelsmann
Education Group, continued their expansion last year. With
their focus on the e-learning (health and technology) and
education services sectors, they recorded overall growth both
in revenues and earnings during the reporting period. The rev-
enues of Bertelsmann’s fully consolidated companies increased
significantly in the past financial year, by 32.6 percent to
€189 million (previous year: €142 million). Operating EBITDA
rose to €3 million (previous year: €-17 million), mainly due to
the successful development of the e-learning provider Relias
and lower start-up and transformation costs in other busi-
nesses. The EBITDA margin was 1.8 percent (previous year:
-11.6 percent).

Relias, currently the most profitable business in the
Bertelsmann Education Group, recorded significant growth,
continued its expansion path during the reporting period, and
grew both organically and through acquisitions. The company
expanded its client base to more than 6,500 institutions, whose
employees completed about 32.8 million online courses in
2017. Through the acquisition of the US company WhiteCloud
Analytics, the Bertelsmann subsidiary further expanded its
expertise in the fields of analytics and performance manage-
ment, thereby expanding its existing business fields. 2.1 Other countries 0.5 Germany

Bertelsmann Investments

The Group's four funds that comprise the Bertelsmann
Investments division further expanded their global network of
shareholdings in international start-ups in 2017. Bertelsmann
Asia Investments (BAI), Bertelsmann Brazil Investments (BBI),
Bertelsmann India Investments (BII) and Bertelsmann Digital
Media Investments (BDMI) made a total of more than 40
new investments while also completing several exits, so that
Bertelsmann held shares in over 160 companies through
its corporate funds at year-end. Across all funds, the focus
was on investments in lines of business that are very relevant
for the Group, such as digital media offerings, e-commerce
services, fintech and education.

Bertelsmann Investments’ business performance is essen-
tially measured by EBIT, which at €141 million significantly
exceeds the previous year's figure of €35 million. Capital gains
from divestments once again made a positive contribution to
Group profit in the past financial year.

In China, BAI made 29 new investments during the report-
ing period, and seven follow-on investments, including in
the bike-sharing app Mobike and mobile commerce ser-
vices provider SEE. For the first time, four BAI holdings
went public in a single year. In 2017, the premium lifestyle
platform Secoo, the fintech company Lexin and the digital
marketing platform iClick debuted on the New York tech-
nology exchange Nasdaq, and the online automobile retail

transaction platform Yixin Group on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange.

In India, BIl strengthened its education market activities
by investing in the education company Eruditus Executive
Education, which develops courses with global lvy League
universities. BIl also made six follow-on investments, includ-
ing in Treebo, a marketplace for budget hotels, and the fintech
start-up Lendingkart, which brokers online loans to small and
medium-sized companies in more than 900 cities.

In Brazil, BBI continued the establishment of a university net-
work focusing on healthcare education and training with its part-
ner Bozano Investimentos, and increased its stake in Medcel,
a provider of online preparatory courses for medical students.

During the reporting period, BDMI made eleven new invest-
ments, including in the video company Wibbitz and the charity
platform Omaze. At the same time, the fund made several
follow-on investments, including in the next-generation pub-
lisher Clique Media.

Through their work, all the funds helped to identify innova-
tive and digital trends for the Group and further strengthen
Bertelsmann’s position as an attractive business partner. Since
2012, the four investment funds have collectively invested
more than €600 million in future-oriented companies.

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2017 25

General Statement by Company Management
on the Economic Situation

Over the financial year 2017, Bertelsmann’s businesses
posted positive overall development. The Group increased its
revenues, operating EBITDA and Group profit year on year
and in some cases exceeded the expectations expressed at
the start of the year. Bertelsmann also made good progress
with its transformation into a faster-growing, more digital,
more international and more diversified Group.

Group revenues in the reporting period rose slightly by
1.4 percent to €17.2 billion from €17.0 billion in the previous
year and were therefore in line with the estimates put forward
(outlook in 2016 Annual Report: slight increase in revenues). The
organic revenue growth was 1.7 percent. Operating EBITDA
recorded a positive deviation from the outlook, increasing to
€2,636 million from €2,568 million in the previous year (out-
look in 2016 Annual Report: stable development), attributable
among other things to a capital gain of €94 million from the
sale of buildings in Paris. At €121 million, the BVA used for
Group management was considerably below the previous
year's figure of €147 million (outlook in 2016 Annual Report:
strongly declining BVA). The expected development reflects
the strong increase in the average level of capital invested,
primarily due to investments, which overcompensated for the
positive effect of an improved operating result.

In the financial year 2017, the Executive Board continued to
focus on the four strategic priorities: strengthening the core busi-
nesses, driving the digital transformation forward, developing
growth platforms and expanding into growth regions. For exam-
ple, the core businesses were strengthened in particular through
the merger of RTL Radio France and Groupe M6, the share-
holding increase in Penguin Random House to 75 percent, and
Gruner + Jahr’s ongoing focus on the core markets in Germany
and France. The Group also pushed forward with the digital
transformation at RTL Group through the full takeover of SpotX
and strong growth in the online video segment at RTL Group,
among other things. The expansion of the growth platform
BMG includes the acquisition of the company BBR Music Group
and other investments and artist signings. In education, Relias
continued to expand its business organically and through the
acquisition of WhiteCloud Analytics. Further new and follow-up
investments were made in the growth regions.

26 Financial Information Combined Management Report

Net assets and financial position remain solid despite the
increased economic debt. Despite the financing of the
shareholding increase in Penguin Random House, the
leverage factor during the reporting period was 2.5, which
is in line with the previous year's level. As of December 31,
2017, the cash and cash equivalents reported at €1.4 billion
(December 31, 2016: €1.4 billion) represent sufficient
liquidity. The ratings agencies Moody’s and S&P continued
to rate Bertelsmann as “Baal” and “BBB+,” respectively,
with a stable outlook. Overall, Bertelsmann ended the finan-
cial year 2017 with a successful performance and has a solid
financial basis.

Alternative Performance Measures

In this Combined Management Report, the following
Alternative Performance Measures, which are not defined
in accordance with IFRS, are used to explain the results of
operations and/or net assets and financial position. These
should not be considered in isolation but as complementary
information for evaluating Bertelsmann’s business situation
and are differentiated in terms of strictly defined and broadly
defined key performance indicators, in the same way as the
value-oriented management system.

The organic growth is calculated by adjusting the reported
revenue growth for the impact of exchange rate effects and
corporate acquisition and disposals. When determining the
exchange rate effects, the functional currency that is valid
in the respective country is used. The other effects include
changes in methods, for example.

Operating EBITDA

Operating EBITDA is determined as earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation, amortization and impairment losses and is
adjusted for special items. The adjustments for special items
serve to determine a sustainable operating result that could
be repeated under normal economic circumstances and
is not affected by special factors or structural distortions.
These special items primarily include impairment losses and
reversals of impairment losses, remeasurements, restructuring
expenses and/or results from disposals of investments. This
means that operating EBITDA is a meaningful performance
indicator. Disposal effects of strategic real estate transactions
are not included in the special items.

BVA

BVA measures the profit realized above and beyond the appro-
priate return on invested capital. This form of value orientation
is reflected in strategic investment, portfolio planning and the
management of Group operations and, together with qualita-
tive criteria, provides the basis for measuring the variable portion
of management remuneration. BVA is calculated as the differ-
ence between net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) and the
cost of capital. NOPAT is calculated on the basis of operating
EBITDA. NOPAT is determined by deducting depreciation and
amortization, provided that they are not included in special
items, and a flat 33 percent tax. Cost of capital is the product of
the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and the average

level of capital invested. The uniform WACC after taxes is
8 percent. The average invested capital is calculated quarterly
on the basis of the Group's operating assets less non-interest-
bearing operating liabilities. In addition, 66 percent of the net
present value of the operating leases is considered in the cal-
culation of invested capital plus other commitments from tech-
nical broadcasting facilities. BVA is determined from financial
year 2018 onward without taking into account the Bertelsmann
Investments division. Bertelsmann Investments’ business per-
formance is essentially measured by EBIT and therefore no
NOPAT contribution occurs for this division. To maintain consis-
tency, the invested capital will be adjusted for the Bertelsmann
Investment division; hence, capital costs will be neutralized

The cash conversion rate serves as a measure of cash gener-
ated from business activities and is calculated as the ratio of
operating free cash flow to operating EBIT. The operating free

cash flow is determined on the basis of the cash flow from
operating activities as reported in the consolidated cash flow
statement, whereby the impact of paid income taxes and the
change in provisions for pensions and similar obligations on
cash flow from operating activities is offset. Operating free
cash flow is also reduced by investments in intangible assets
and property, plant and equipment or, if applicable, increased
by proceeds from the sale of non-current assets. Further
adjustments are made to ensure an allocation of capital flows
to the relevant periods and to offset the impact of payment
flows resulting from special items on the operating free cash
flow in a way that is methodically consistent with the operating
EBITDA. Further adjustments in the financial year 2017 mainly
reflected the impact of restructuring measures on payments.
The operating EBITDA is used to calculate the operating EBIT
by deducting amortization and depreciation, provided that
these are not included in special items. The Group aims to
maintain a cash conversion rate of 90 percent to 100 percent

Economic Debt

Net financial debt is calculated on the basis of gross financial
debt, which comprises the balance sheet items current and non-
current financial debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Eco-
nomic debt is defined as net financial debt less the 50 percent
par value component of the hybrid bonds plus provisions for
pensions, profit participation capital and the net present value
of operating leases. In calculating economic debt, the hybrid
bonds are accounted for at 50 percent as both bonds are classi-
fied by the rating agencies as 50 percent equity. Economic debt
is modified for the purposes of calculating the leverage factor.

Leverage Factor

One of the financial targets is a dynamic leverage factor calcu-
lated as the ratio of economic debt to operating EBITDA and
limited to the defined maximum of 2.5. In determining the
leverage factor, the economic debt and the operating EBITDA
are modified to enable financial management that corre-
sponds to the Group’s structure and its tolerable indebt-
edness. The modifications in regard to the economic debt
largely relate to cash and cash equivalents, which are tied
up in the Group while the modifications in regard to the
operating EBTIDA address the Group's structure and its
co-shareholder shares. The leverage factor determined in
this way is thus always more conservative than the figure
that would be obtained using only the items recognized in
the balance sheet.

Significant Events After the Balance Sheet Date

On January 16, 2018, Thomas Buberl was appointed as a
new member of the Supervisory Board of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA with immediate effect.

At the end of January 2018, Bertelsmann announced that it
was looking at various options for the further development of
Arvato CRM Solutions. The options include partnerships and
the complete or partial sale of the CRM businesses. The pro-
cess will not include Arvato’s CRM business in French-speaking
countries, which in the future will be managed by Bertelsmann.
The process will take several months to complete.

Risks and Opportunities

Risk Management System

The purpose of the Bertelsmann risk management system (RMS)
is the early identification and evaluation of, as well as
response to, internal and external risks. The internal control
system (ICS), an integral component of the RMS, monitors
the effectiveness of the risk response measures that have
been implemented. The aim of the RMS is to identify, at an
early stage, material risks to the Group so that risk response
measures can be taken and controls implemented. Risks are
possible future developments or events that could result in a
negative deviation from outlook or objective for Bertelsmann.
In addition, risks can negatively affect the achievement of
the Group’s strategic, operational, reporting and compliance-
related objectives and its reputation.

The risk management process is based on the internationally
accepted frameworks of the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO Enterprise
Risk Management — Integrated Framework and Internal
Control — Integrated Framework, respectively) and is organized
in subprocesses of identification, assessment, response, con-
trol, communication and monitoring. A major element of risk
identification is a risk inventory that lists significant risks year
by year, from the profit center level upward. These risks are
aggregated step by step at the division and Group levels. This
ensures that risks are registered where their impact would be
felt. There is also a Group-wide reassessment of critical risks
every six months and quarterly reporting in case the risk situa-
tion has changed. Ad hoc reporting requirements ensure that
significant changes in the risk situation during the course of
the year are brought to the attention of the Executive Board.
The risks are compared to risk management and control
measures to determine the net risk position. Both one- and
three-year risk assessment horizons are applied to enable the
timely implementation of risk response measures. The basis
for determining the main Group risks is the three-year period,
similar to medium-term corporate planning. Risk assessment
is the product of the estimated negative impact on Group free

cash flow should the risk occur and the estimated probability
of occurrence. Risk monitoring is conducted by Group man-
agement on an ongoing basis. The RMS, along with its com-
ponent ICS, is constantly undergoing further development
and is integrated into ongoing reporting to the Bertelsmann
Executive Board and Supervisory Board. Corporate and
Divisional Risk Management Committee meetings are con-
vened at regular intervals to ensure compliance with statutory
and internal requirements.

The Group auditors inspect the risk early-warning system
for its capacity to identify developments early on that could
threaten the existence of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA accord-
ing to section 91(2) of Germany's Stock Corporation Act (AktG)
and then report their findings to the Supervisory Board of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. Corporate Audit conducts ongo-
ing reviews of the adequacy and functional capability of the
RMS in all divisions apart from RTL Group. RTL Group's RMS
is evaluated by the respective internal auditing department
and by the external auditor. Any issues that are identified
are promptly remedied through appropriate measures. The
Bertelsmann Executive Board defined the scope and focus of
the RMS based on the specific circumstances of the company.
However, even an appropriately designed and functional RMS
cannot guarantee with absolute certainty that risks will be
identified and controlled.

Accounting-Related Risk Management System and Internal
Control System

The objectives of the accounting-related RMS and ICS are to
ensure that external and internal accounting are proper and
reliable in accordance with applicable laws and that informa-
tion is made available without delay. Reporting should also
present a true and fair view of Bertelsmann’s net assets, finan-
cial position and results of operation. The following statements
pertain to the Consolidated Financial Statements (including
the “Notes” to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” and
“Combined Management Report” sections), interim reporting
and internal management reporting.

The ICS for the accounting process consists of the follow-
ing areas: The Group's internal rules for accounting and the
preparation of financial statements (e.g., IFRS manual, guide-
lines and circulars) are made available without delay to all
employees involved in the accounting process. The Group
financial statements are prepared in a reporting system that
is uniform throughout the Group. Extensive automatic system
controls ensure the consistency of the data in the financial
statements. The system is subject to ongoing development

30 Financial Information Combined Management Report

through a documented change process. Systematized pro-
cesses for coordinating intercompany transactions serve
to prepare the corresponding consolidation steps. Circum-
stances that could lead to significant misinformation in the
Consolidated Financial Statements are monitored centrally by
employees of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and by RTL Group
(for the preconsolidated subgroup) and then verified by
external experts as required. Central contact persons from
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and the divisions are also in
continuous contact with local subsidiaries to ensure IFRS-
compliant accounting as well as compliance with reporting
deadlines and obligations. These preventive measures
are supplemented by specific controls in the form of analy-
ses by the Corporate Financial Reporting department of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and RTL Group (for the preconsol-
idated subgroup). The purpose of such analyses is to identify
any remaining inconsistencies. The controlling departments
at the Group and division levels are also integrated into the
internal management reporting. Internal and external report-
ing are reconciled during the quarterly segment reconcilia-
tion process. The further aim in introducing a globally binding
control framework for the decentralized accounting processes
is to achieve a standardized ICS format at the level of the
local accounting departments of all fully consolidated Group
companies. The findings of the external auditors, Corporate
Audit and the internal auditing department of RTL Group are
promptly discussed with the affected companies and solutions
are developed. An annual self-assessment is conducted to
establish reporting on the quality of the ICS in the key fully
consolidated Group companies. The findings are discussed at
the divisional level. Like the RMS, each ICS cannot guarantee
with absolute certainty that significant misinformation in the
accounting process can be prevented or identified.

Corporate Audit and the internal auditing department of
RTL Group evaluate the accounting-related processes as part
of their auditing work. As part of the auditing process, the
Group auditor also reports to the Audit and Finance Committee
of the Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA Supervisory Board about
any significant vulnerabilities of the accounting-related ICS
that were identified during the audit and the findings regard-
ing the risk early-warning system.

Major Risks to the Group

Bertelsmann is exposed to a variety of risks. The major risks to
Bertelsmann identified in the risk reporting are listed in order
of priority in the table below. In line with the level of possible
financial loss, the risks are classified as low, moderate, sig-
nificant, considerable or endangering, for the purposes of risk

tolerability. The risk inventory carried out did not identify any
risks that would be classified as considerable or endangering.

Given the diversity of the businesses in which Bertelsmann is
active and the corresponding diversity of risks to which the vari-
ous divisions are exposed, the key strategic and operational risks
to the Group that have been identified are specified below. Risks
from acquisitions and information security risks were identified as
the primary risks and are therefore described separately. This is fol-
lowed by an outline of legal and regulatory risks and financial mar-
ket risks. These risks are largely managed at the corporate level.

Strategic and Operational Risks

The growth of the global economy noticeably accelerated in
2017. This level of growth is expected to continue in 2018.
Bertelsmann’s business development is still subject to risks. In
particular, the unclear conditions of Brexit and the associated
uncertainty could adversely impact Bertelsmann’s economic
environment and thus increase the risk from economic devel-
opments. Since the Brexit decision, Bertelsmann had been
continuously monitoring the exit process to identify any risks
at an early stage. Among other things, a Brexit Taskforce was
established to coordinate information and develop action plans.
In the short to medium term, other significant Group risks
include pricing and discounting risks, changes in the market
environment, customer risks, loss of audience and market
share, supplier relationship risks and risks associated with eco-
nomic development. How these risks develop depends, among
other things, to a large extent on changes in customer behavior

due to factors such as the continued digitization of media, the
development and implementation of products and services by
new or existing competitors, bad debt losses, and default and
interference along the production chains in individual sectors,
such as IT. Employee-related and legal and regulatory risks are
moderate risks for Bertelsmann, while financial market risks
and risks from future technological challenges in the three-year
period under review are classified as low.

Increasing competition and constant change, particularly in the
digital environment, are resulting in a stronger fragmentation of
RTL Group’s markets as audiences will have more choice (e.g.,
through online platforms) and, at the same time, the market-
entry barriers are being lowered. The possible risks of this for
RTL Group are decreasing audience and advertising market
shares of its advertising-financed channels and therefore, ulti-
mately, lower revenues. To counter these risks, RTL Group is
continuously revising and developing the channels and pro-
gram strategies — for example, by establishing complementary
families of channels and constantly adapting these to inter-
national program trends. RTL Group is addressing the risks
associated with digitization and is actively helping to shape
this trend through a range of investments in the fast-growing
online video market and in advertising technology. Increasing
competition in the area of program acquisition and TV produc-
tion and the growing dependence on individual production
companies, coupled with the risk of potential cost increases,
could also impact RTL Group's ability to generate revenues.
This risk is being reduced by expanding the program share of
own productions — in particular local content — and signing

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2017 31


--- Page 29 ---

long-term contracts with major content providers. Further-
more, economic development directly impacts the TV adver-
tising markets and therefore RTL Group's revenue. This risk is
being countered by focusing on developing non-advertising
revenue streams such as distribution revenues from platform
operators. To reduce the risk of customer losses, active cus-
tomer relationship management has been established.

Falling e-book sales constitute one risk for Penguin
Random House, triggered in particular by falling sales prices
and changes to the sales conditions for e-books. Declining
sales from physical books, due to declining sales figures and
increasing margin pressure in brick-and-mortar book retail, is
another risk. Penguin Random House is countering these risks
by introducing differentiated pricing, increasing online sales
of physical books and continuously examining alternative
marketing options. Any risk of bad debt loss is being limited
through debtor management and in some cases through credit
insurance. In addition, Penguin Random House is finding
itself exposed to the risk of cost increases. There are also
risks from general economic uncertainty, which could lead to
lower sales. Management controls these risks through careful
management of supplier relationships and by maintaining a
flexible cost structure that allows for a quick response in the
event of an economic downturn.

For Gruner + Jahr, besides the risk of a deterioration of the
overall market environment and the resulting declines in
advertising and circulation revenues, supplier risks represent
significant challenges. A changing market environment with
price pressure and declining revenues as a result of further
concentration in the agency market and more aggressive
advertising conditions may lead to falling margins. Further-
more, there is the risk of losing key customers as advertising
customers could switch to other media, notably digital media.
In France, the ongoing restructuring efforts for the service
provider Presstalis could result in higher costs for the publishing
houses. Currently the large publishing houses are engaged in
negotiations with government representatives over the extent
of their share in the restructuring of Presstalis. The risks are
being countered by active cost and customer management;
development of new, in particular digital, forms of offer-
ings and product, price and quality improvements. Through
association work, the Group is responding to the advertising
restrictions discussed at the EU level (e.g., car advertising),
which could lead to declining advertising revenues.

Risks that affect BMG primarily concern the business

structure (including artists/authors and distribution partners),
corporate growth (including acquisitions and integrations)

32 Financial Information Combined Management Report

and the scalability of the company (including technical
platform and organization). Market risks are addressed through
high revenue diversification (clients/catalogs, business
segments, regions) and contractual protection clauses
(securing the recouping of advances).

Arvato sees itself as particularly exposed to risks from customer
and supplier relationships. The potential loss of key customers
is being countered through contracts offering comprehensive
service packages with simultaneously flexible cost structures.
On the supplier side there are risks associated with the quality
and availability of goods and services. The same applies to pro-
curement and labor costs where these cannot be passed on
to customers. Countermeasures include an active exchange
with existing suppliers, entering into long-term framework
agreements and monitoring the supplier market. Technological
trends arising from the digitization and ongoing automation
could in some cases damage the business model and compet-
itiveness in individual customer segments. New competitors
entering the market could intensify the competitive pressure
and lead to lower margins. By developing the range of services,
the aim is to improve the competitive position and to increase
customer loyalty through integrated solutions. A worsening of
the economic environment could result in declining revenues
and thus lower margins, which would necessitate cost-cutting
measures and capacity downsizing. Broad diversification
across regions and sectors helps to reduce this risk.

For Bertelsmann Printing Group, customer risks are the most
significant risks. In addition, price and margin pressures result
from a market environment that is characterized by over-
capacity and existing trends toward consolidation. As well as
the dependence on a handful of suppliers, there are further
risks on the supplier side associated with rising raw material
prices — particularly for paper — and with the quality of the raw
materials purchased. Furthermore, deterioration in the eco-
nomic environment also may lead to declining circulations.
Similarly, the increasing use of digital media is accelerating the
decline in circulation, particularly in the magazine segment.
These risk minimization strategies are based, in particular,
on the expansion of innovative print services, constantly
optimizing cost structures and monitoring markets on an
ongoing basis.

For the Bertelsmann Education Group, increasing competition
with other online providers, particularly in the US healthcare
market, can lead to growing price and margin pressure and
impact the planned growth targets. These risks are being
countered in particular through strategic partnerships and
marketing measures.


--- Page 30 ---

The key risks for Bertelsmann Investments consist of falling
portfolio valuations and a lack of exit opportunities. These
risks are being addressed through a standardized investment
process and continuous monitoring of investments.

The increasing pace of change in the markets and in
Bertelsmann’s business segments means that employees
will need to be more willing and able to adapt in the future.
There are also continuing demographic risks that impact the
recruitment, development and retention of talent as a result
of shifts in the age distribution of the workforce. To counteract
this, employees are being offered further individual education,
comprehensive health programs, a competitive salary and
flexible working models. Bertelsmann is also extending its
recruitment measures and making it easier for employees to
switch jobs within the Group by harmonizing processes and
structures.

Acquisition-Related Risks

The Group strategy focuses on acquisitions of businesses
and organic growth. The risk of potential mistakes when
selecting investments and the allocation of investment funds
is limited by means of strict investment criteria and pro-
cesses. Acquisitions present both opportunities and risks.
For example, integration into the Group requires one-time
costs that are usually offset by increased benefits in the long
term, thanks to synergy effects. The risks here are that the
integration costs may be higher than expected or the pre-
dicted level of synergies may not materialize. The integration
processes are therefore being monitored by management on
an ongoing basis.

Information Security Risks

For a global media company like Bertelsmann, the reliability
and security of information technology are crucial — and a
competitive edge. The ability to provide and process infor-
mation in a timely, comprehensive, error-free and confi-
dential way is crucial to Bertelsmann’s success. Challenges
arise, on the one hand, from the many non-standardized
internal processes and comparatively fragmented IT system
landscapes and on the other hand from external potential
risks such as cyberattacks, which are still increasing
dramatically in the market and competitive environment.
Bertelsmann has responded to the stricter regulatory con-
ditions at management level with an information security
management system (ISMS, based on industry standard
ISO 27001) that was introduced across the Group in 2014. This
includes regular and structured monitoring of compliance

with Group regulations and systematic recording of infor-
mation security risks and deriving appropriate mitigation
measures. Bertelsmann has also responded to the stricter
regulatory conditions by introducing specific measures that
have a direct impact on IT security. Notable examples include
measures to increase e-mail security within the Group and
to increase employee awareness of spoof emails (known as
phishing). Other important measures include the establishment
of an ecosystem of external partners - among other
things to gain access to state-of-the-art cybersecurity tech-
nologies — and membership in the German cybersecurity
organization (DCSO) to promote professional dialogue with
other major German companies. In addition, a Group-wide
platform has been introduced for measuring and comparing
the level of security of all linked systems worldwide and to
identify security incidents on these systems.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

Bertelsmann, with its worldwide operations, is exposed to a
variety of legal and regulatory risks concerning, for example,
litigation or varying interpretations of tax assessment
criteria. Bertelsmann has television and radio operations
in several European countries that are subject to regulation.
In Germany, for example, the media is subject to over-
sight by the Commission on Concentration in the Media.
Bertelsmann Group companies occupy leading market
positions in many lines of business and may therefore have
limited potential for growth through acquisition due to anti-
trust legislation. Moreover, the education activities are sub-
ject to regulatory provisions of government authorities and
accreditation bodies. Other risks include litigation relating to
company acquisitions and disposals, which mainly relate to
different interpretations of contract components. These risks
are being continuously monitored by the relevant divisions
within the Group.

Several subsidiaries of the Group are being sued by broad-
caster RTL 2 Fernsehen GmbH & Co. KG and its sales house
El Cartel Media GmbH & Co. KG before the regional court
in Dusseldorf in Germany seeking disclosure of information
in order to substantiate a possible claim for damages. The
proceedings succeed the imposition of a fine in 2007 by
the German Federal Cartel Office for the abuse of market
dominance with regard to discount scheme agreements
(“share deals”) |P Deutschland GmbH and SevenOne Media
GmbH granted to media agencies. The German Federal
Cartel Office argued that these discounts would foreclose
the advertising market for small broadcasters. In 2014,
the court of Dusseldorf decided to order an expert report.

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2017 33


--- Page 31 ---

The expert concluded in February 2018 that the likelihood of
damages cannot be proven with certainty. It is assumed that
the court will render its judgment in the second half of 2018.
This judgment will be open to appeal. Similar proceedings
of other small broadcasters initiated in different courts were
unsuccessful or have been withdrawn.

In June 2016, the main competitors of Fun Radio alleged
that a host of the morning show had influenced Fun Radio's
audience results by encouraging his listeners to give favorable
treatment to Fun Radio in the Médiamétrie surveys. In
response to these allegations, Médiamétrie decided
to remove Fun Radio from its surveys. Following a legal
procedure initiated by Fun Radio, Médiamétrie was required to
reinstate Fun Radio in the audience results surveys as from
September 2016. Nevertheless, Médiamétrie decided to
lower Fun Radio's audience results in its published surveys,
alleging the existence of a “halo effect.” Following a procedure
initiated by Fun Radio, a judicial expert was appointed in
December 2017 to examine Médiamétrie’s assessment of
the alleged “halo effect.” In any case, as from September
2017, Médiamétrie has again published the full audience
results for Fun Radio. In parallel to the above procedure, the
main competitors of Fun Radio also filed, in December 2016,
a claim for damages, claiming unfair competition. However,
in the meantime, two of the claimants withdrew their claim
and from the proceedings. The rest of the procedure is
currently still ongoing.

Foreign direct investments in the People’s Republic of China
are subject to a number of regulatory restrictions. To satisfy
local requirements, some of Bertelsmann’s activities in China
are owned by trust structures. Agreements have been signed
with these trust structures to secure Bertelsmann’s rights.
These types of arrangements (known as “VIE” structures)
are standard market practice for investments in China. How-
ever, these structures are rarely the subject of legal disputes
in China, which means that there is a certain risk that it will
not be possible to safeguard VIE structures through the
courts particularly if the People’s Republic changes its
policies toward investments by foreigners (particularly in
respect to VIE structures) or if courts and authorities change
their case law or administrative practice. In 2015 the “PRC
Foreign Investment Law” was revised by the Chinese Ministry
of Economic Affairs and is now being discussed politically.
The current draft stipulates that foreign investments in China
shall be regulated via a “negative list” which will count the
limited number of possible investments and those that are
prohibited in particular industries and will also include a ban
on VIE structures. In the past, however, such harsh measures

34 Financial Information Combined Management Report

have only been reported in exceptional cases. By contrast,
observers are anticipating solutions that will only have a minor
impact on the Chinese economy. This affects companies
within Fremantle Media, BMG, Arvato and the Bertelsmann
Education Group as well as investments by Bertelsmann
Asia Investments (BAI).

Aside from the matters outlined above, no further significant
legal and regulatory risks to Bertelsmann are apparent at this
time.

Financial Market Risks

As an international corporation, Bertelsmann is exposed to
various forms of financial market risk, especially interest
rate and currency risks. These risks are largely controlled by
the Central Financial Department on the basis of guidelines
established by the Bertelsmann Executive Board. Derivative
financial instruments are used solely for hedging purposes.
Bertelsmann mainly uses currency derivatives to hedge existing
foreign currency risks from intercompany financing and
operating liabilities. Some firm commitments denominated
in foreign currency are partially hedged when they are made,
with the hedged amount being adapted over time. A number
of subsidiaries are based outside the eurozone. The resulting
translation risk to the leverage factor is managed based on
economic debt in relation to operating EBITDA (leverage
factor). Bertelsmann’s long-term focus is on the maximum
leverage factor permitted for the Group. Foreign currency
translation risks arising from net investments in foreign entities
are not hedged. The cash flow risk from interest rate changes
is centrally monitored and controlled as part of interest rate
management. The aim is to achieve a balanced ratio of different
fixed interest rates through the selection of appropriate
maturity periods for the originated financial assets and
liabilities affecting liquidity and through the ongoing use of
interest rate derivatives. The liquidity risk is regularly monitored
on the basis of the budget planning. The syndicated loan
and appropriate liquidity provisions form a sufficient risk
buffer for unplanned payments. Counterparty risks exist in the
Group in respect to invested cash and cash equivalents and
in an amount equivalent to the positive fair value from existing
derivatives and are exclusively conducted with a defined
group of banks with an impeccable credit rating. Within the
guidelines, a risk limit specified by the Bertelsmann Executive
Board has been issued for financial assets and derivatives
for each counterparty. Compliance with this limit is regularly
monitored by the Central Financial Department. The guidelines
concerning the investment of cash and cash equivalents
are continuously monitored and extended if necessary.


--- Page 32 ---

Financial investments are made on a short-term basis so that
the investment volume can be reduced if the credit rating
changes. Overall, the financial market risks are estimated
as low.

General Statement on the Risk Situation

The risks identified in the financial year 2017 are not endan-
gering. Neither are there any substantial risks discernible that
could threaten the existence of the Group.

The overall risk situation is slightly above the previous year’s
level. The major risks to the Group have not changed com-
pared to the previous year. In particular, pricing and discounting
risks, a changing market environment and customer and
supplier relationship risks, and volatile economic development
still constitute the key Group challenges. However, as a result
of the diversification of Group businesses, there are no con-
centration risks stemming from dependency on individual
business partners or products in either procurement or sales.
The Group's financial position is solid, with liquidity needs
covered by existing liquidity and available credit facilities.

Opportunity Management System

An efficient opportunity management system enables
Bertelsmann to secure its corporate success in the long term
and to exploit potential in an optimal way. Opportunities are
possible future developments or events that could result in a
positive deviation from outlook or objective for Bertelsmann.
The opportunity management system, like the RMS, is an integral
component of the business processes and company decisions.
During the strategy and planning process, significant oppor-
tunities are determined each year from the profit center level
upward, and then aggregated step by step at the division and
Group levels. By systematically recording them on several
reporting levels, opportunities that arise can be identified and
exploited at an early stage. This also creates an interdivisional
overview of Bertelsmann’s current opportunities. A review of
major changes in opportunities is conducted at the divisional
level every six months. In addition, the largely decentralized
opportunity management system is coordinated by central
departments in the Group to derive synergies through targeted
cooperation in the individual divisions. The interdivisional
experience transfer is reinforced by regular meetings of the GMC.

Opportunities

While the above-mentioned opportunities associated with
positive development may be accompanied by corresponding

risks, certain risks are entered into in order to be able to exploit
potential opportunities. This link to the key Group risks offers
strategic, operational, legal, regulatory and financial opportu-
nities for Bertelsmann.

Strategic opportunities can be derived primarily from the
Group's four strategic priorities. Strengthening core busi-
nesses, driving forward the digital transformation, developing
growth platforms and expanding in growth regions
constitute the most important long-term growth opportunities
for Bertelsmann (see the “Strategy” section). In particular,
there are opportunities in some cases for exploiting
synergies as a result of the strategic portfolio expansions.
There are individual operating opportunities in the individual
divisions in addition to the possibility of more favorable
economic development.

For RTL Group, a better-than-expected development of the
TV advertising markets and higher audience and advertising
market shares are major opportunities. Furthermore, the
increasing digitization and fragmentation of the media
landscape are opening up opportunities. Professionally
produced content can be distributed across multiple plat-
forms nationally and internationally. New revenue streams
could be generated by exploiting existing TV content across
different platforms and by creating native digital content.
Also, with an increased presence in the digital sector,
RTL Group could increase online video advertising sales
on all devices and TV platforms and establish pay models
in the on-demand business. In this way, new advertising
sales could be generated through the offering of new
interactive or targeted forms of advertising (HbbTV, IPTV
or mobile television). As an established content producer
with a global presence, RTL Group could further expand its
digital distribution through multichannel networks and
digital streaming platforms.

Penguin Random House is the world’s largest trade book
publisher. Its position enables the publishing group to
attract new authors and book projects to potentially grow
its market share. The group is well positioned to invest in
emerging and multilingual markets to take advantage of
increasing interest in long-form reading, and to thereby
offer its content to the widest possible readership. The
digital evolution transforming book markets offers the
potential for new product development and for broader and
more efficient marketing channels. Digital enhancements could
make books more widely appealing, while new online tools
and platforms can expand and enhance author engagement
with the audience.

For Gruner + Jahr, better development of the advertising
and sales markets represents significant opportunities. The
transformation is providing further opportunities due to the
development of new businesses related to the published
brands. There are opportunities for growth, particularly in
the development and expansion of digital activities and in
cooperation with other publishers and marketers. There are
also opportunities for developing additional services, such
as commerce and paid services. In terms of marketing, G+J
could gain new customers through new forms of advertising
in the online, mobile and video media channels.

BMG anticipates further growth opportunities both through
additional signings of artists and songwriters and through
further takeovers of music rights catalogs, which could be
managed on the existing platform at marginal cost. The accel-
erated market penetration of music streaming services also
offers the opportunity for expansion of the recorded music
and music publishing markets at an international level.

At Arvato, interdivisional cooperation and major projects can
provide additional opportunities for acquiring new customers.
The global e-commerce market will continue its dynamic
growth over the next few years. Arvato could participate
significantly in this growth through new services, particularly
those offered by the Solution Groups SCM and Financial
Solutions. Further growth opportunities from the ongoing
digitization lie in the development of innovative IP-based and
cloud-based IT services.

The Bertelsmann Printing Group businesses may decline
less steeply through additional volumes of existing and new
customers. This would provide opportunities from the targeted
servicing of market segments that are still growing. There
could also be a further consolidation of competitors, which
could result in an additional strengthening of Bertelsmann
Printing Group's own market position.

The education business is being developed as Bertelsmann’s
third earnings pillar, alongside the media and service busi-
nesses. A further shift away from the traditional classroom-
based delivery methods toward online and_ skill-based
training could offer further growth opportunities for the
education business. The growing online education market
also offers organic growth opportunities for Bertelsmann
Education Group businesses. Relias has the potential to
grow through the expansion of employee assessment and
data analytics products, and through internationalization.
Owing to the lack of skilled workers and the ongoing demand
for further education in the technology sector, Udacity has

36 Financial Information Combined Management Report

opportunities to develop into a premium brand in the area of
IT and technology training.

For the Bertelsmann Investments fund activities, there is the
opportunity to realize higher-than-expected profits, thanks
to increasing portfolio valuations or through the disposal of
investments.

The current innovation efforts detailed in the “Innovations”
section offer further potential opportunities for the individual
divisions.

Other opportunities could arise from changes to the legal and
regulatory environment.

The financial opportunities are largely based on a favor-
able development of interest and exchange rates from
Bertelsmann’s point of view.

Outlook

Anticipated Overall Economic Development

Bertelsmann anticipates that economic conditions will
develop as follows in 2018. The solid global economic growth
will continue. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW)
estimates that global production will increase by 3.9 percent
in 2018, compared to 3.8 percent in 2017. The increases in
growth are expected to be spread evenly across industrial
and emerging countries. Risks to the global economy arise
in particular from the financial environment and from
uncertainties over a possible normalization of monetary policy.

The economic upturn in the eurozone is set to continue. It is
therefore expected that the increase in real GDP in 2018 of
2.3 percent will be similar to last year. The economic recovery
in Germany is expected to continue over the coming year. This
positive outlook is based on a consumer climate that is likely
to remain good, coupled with increasing investment activity.
The IfW expects GDP to grow by 2.5 percent in real terms.
The growth rate in France is expected to be 2.0 percent in real
terms. In the United Kingdom the growth of real GDP is likely
to remain relatively modest at just 1.4 percent. The subdued
growth expectations reflect the significant uncertainty over
the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and future economic
relations. Moreover, the devaluation of the local currency after
the referendum on EU membership is having an increasingly
adverse effect on the consumer climate. For the United States,
real economic growth of 2.5 percent is expected.

Anticipated Development in Relevant Markets

The worldwide media industry is primarily influenced by
global economic developments and the resulting growth
dynamic. The continued trend toward digitization of content
and distribution channels, changes in media usage and the
increasing influence of emerging economies will continue to
present risks and opportunities in the years to come. Through
the intended transformation of the Group portfolio in line with
the four strategic priorities, Bertelsmann expects to benefit to
an increasing extent from the resulting opportunities. Through
its businesses, Bertelsmann operates in a variety of different
markets and regions whose developments are subject to a
range of factors and that do not respond in a linear fashion to
overall economic tendencies. The following takes into account
only those markets and regions that are large enough to be
relevant for forecasting purposes and whose expected devel-
opment can be appropriately aggregated and evaluated or
that are strategically important from a Group perspective.

For 2018 the European TV advertising markets are expected
to remain stable or grow at a moderate rate, apart from the
Netherlands where a moderate decline is anticipated. In the
book markets, an overall stable development is expected. In the
magazine business, the strong decline in the print advertising
and circulation markets in Germany and France will persist in
2018, while continued strong growth is expected in the digital
segment. For 2018, continuing moderate growth of the global
music market is expected in the publishing rights segment.
At the same time, significant growth is anticipated in the
recording rights segment. In 2018, the services markets are
expected to achieve growth similar to the previous year. The
gravure printing market in 2018 is likely to show an ongoing
significant decline. Continued stable development is expected
however for the offset market in Europe and the book printing
market in North America. Overall, sustained strong growth is
anticipated for the relevant US education markets.

Expected Business Development

The global economy is on a moderate growth path. However,
economic prospects continue to be subject to certain risks.
The following expectations are therefore based on the
assumption that the recovery of the overall economic situation
will continue and that most of the forecasted market
developments and the economic predictions of the research
institutions will be realized.

For the financial year 2018, Bertelsmann anticipates that
business development will be driven by the stable to slightly

positive market expectations for the European TV advertising
markets, by stable book markets, and by continuously growing
service and music markets. The growth stimuli created
through strategic portfolio expansions will continue to have a
positive impact on Bertelsmann’s growth profile.

In addition to the assumed market developments, the
predicted economic developments in the geographic core
markets of Western Europe and the United States are the
basis of the expected business development. With revenue
and earnings share within the eurozone expected at around
two-thirds, the extent of growth is above all based on the
forecasted real and nominal economic development in
this economic zone. The IfW therefore predicts that GDP
in the eurozone will increase by 2.3 percent in real terms
and that the International Monetary Fund will increase by
2.2 percent for 2018. In view of these economic expectations,
Bertelsmann expects Group revenues to show a moderate
increase in the financial year 2018. Not including the capital
gains from strategic real estate transactions realized for the
financial year 2017, stable development of operating EBITDA
is anticipated for the financial year 2018. If these gains are
included, however, operating EBITDA is expected to decline
moderately in the financial year 2018. The average level of
capital invested will continue to increase in the financial
year 2018 as a result of acquisitions made and the organic
expansion of growth businesses. Compensating effects from
earnings contributions are not expected to materialize for
some time. Consequently, a strong fall in BVA is still expected
for the Group. The same applies for BVA calculated by from
financial year 2018 onward implemented methodology. These
expectations are based on operational planning and the
medium-term outlook for the corporate divisions, assuming
that exchange rates remain constant.

At present, the expected performance of any individual unit of
key significance for the Bertelsmann Group is not expected to
deviate significantly from that of the Group.

Depending on how the economy develops, Bertelsmann does
not currently anticipate interest rate changes to have any
material impact on the average financing costs of medium-
to long-term financing. The liquidity situation in the forecast
period is expected to be sufficient.

These forecasts are based on Bertelsmann’s business
strategy, as outlined in the “Corporate Profile” section. In
general, the forecasts reflect careful consideration of risks and
opportunities. All statements concerning potential economic
and business developments represent opinions advanced on

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2017 37

the basis of the information that is currently available. Should
underlying assumptions fail to apply and/or further risks arise,
actual results may differ from those expected. Accordingly,
no assurances can be provided concerning the accuracy of
such statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA (in accordance with
HGB, German Commercial Code)

In addition to the Group reporting, the business develop-
ment of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is outlined below.
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is a parent company and a
management holding company of the Bertelsmann Group.
Its tasks include management functions for the Bertelsmann
Group as well as the management of its investments and
financing. There are also service functions for individual
divisions within the Corporate Center. It also bears the tax
liability for most of the subsidiaries in Germany. The position
of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is essentially determined by
the business success of the Bertelsmann Group.

The Annual Financial Statements of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA, in contrast to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
have not been prepared in accordance with the International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) but in accordance
with the regulations of the German Commercial Code (HGB)
and the supplementary regulations of the German Stock
Corporation Act (AktG).

Results of Operations of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA

The results of operations of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
will continue to be significantly affected by the amount of
income from other participations, due to that company’s
role as the parent company of the Bertelsmann Group.
The decrease in net income to €363 million (previous year:
€450 million) is primarily attributable to the lower income
from other participations and higher tax expenses. This
development was partially offset by higher other operating
income.

The increase in other operating income is attributable to
increased write-ups recognized on the shares in Bertelsmann
Inc., Wilmington, of €67 million and currency gains.

The downward trend in the income from participations
from €857 million to €687 million is primarily attributable to
income from profit and loss transfer agreements. Firstly, this
development is the result of the absence of the positive special
effects of the 2016 financial year in connection with the
new accounting rules of the law “Gesetz zur Umsetzung der
Wohnimmobilienkreditrichtlinie und zur Anderung handels-
rechtlicher Secondly, the
subsidiaries is negatively impacted by write-downs of long-
term financial assets in the 2017 financial year.

Vorschriften.” income from

In addition to higher taxable income, the increase in tax
expenses from €-131 million to €-198 million is the result of the
complete use of the corporate income tax loss carryforward
in the previous year.

Net Assets and Financial Position of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA

The total assets of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA increased
from €19,482 million to €21,182 million. A high ratio of equity
(45 percent) and long-term financial assets (79 percent) to
total assets continues to dictate the performance of the net
assets and financial position.

The increase in long-term financial assets of €1,267 million
concerns the medium- and long-term loans granted to
Bertelsmann, Inc., Wilmington, which are presented as loans
to affiliated companies. To a significant degree, the loans
granted are the result of converting short-term receivables
due from Bertelsmann, Inc., Wilmington. The receivables
due from affiliated companies decreased by a corresponding
amount compared to the previous year. In addition, the carry-
ing amount of investments in affiliated companies increased
by €588 million mainly in connection with the contributions
to subsidiaries. In the 2017 financial year, contributions are
primarily concerning Bertelsmann Capital Holding GmbH,
GUtersloh, and the Gruner + Jahr GmbH & Co KG, Hamburg.

The equity increased as a result of the net income of
the reporting year by €363 million and decreased by
€180 million as a result of distributions to shareholders.
The increase in liabilities to €11,177 million (previous year:
€9,673 million) includes €650 million from bonds and
promissory notes as a result of issuing one new bond and

one new promissory note. In addition, liabilities to affiliated
companies increased by €633 million. The amount of the
loans granted by subsidiaries to Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
is affected by the development of the financial position of
these subsidiaries.

Risks and Opportunities for Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA

As Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is largely linked to the
Bertelsmann Group companies, among other things through
the financing and guarantee commitments as well as through
direct and indirect investments in the subsidiaries, the situation
of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA in terms of risks and opportu-
nities is primarily dependent on the risks and opportunities of
the Bertelsmann Group. In this respect, the statements made
by corporate management concerning the overall assessment
of the risks and opportunities also constitute a summary of the
risks and opportunities of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA (see
the “Risks and Opportunities” section).

Outlook for Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA

As the parent company of the Bertelsmann Group,
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA receives dividend distri-
butions from its subsidiaries as well as income from ser-
vices provided to them. Consequently, the performance of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is primarily determined by the
business performance of the Bertelsmann Group (see the
“Outlook” section).

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2017 39

Dependent Company Report (Statement in accordance with
Section 312 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG))

The Executive Board of Bertelsmann Management SE, as
general partner of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA, has submitted a
voluntary report to the Supervisory Board of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA in accordance with sections 278 (3) and 312 (1) of
the German Stock Corporation Act, in which it outlines its rela-
tionships with affiliated companies for the financial year 2017.
The Executive Board hereby declares that Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA received adequate consideration in return for each
and every legal transaction under the circumstances known at
the time that the transactions were undertaken.

Combined Non-Financial Statement

The following information relates to Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
and the Bertelsmann Group (“Bertelsmann”) with its incorpo-
rated, fully consolidated subsidiaries (“subsidiaries”).

Bertelsmann operates in the core business fields of media,
services and education in around 50 countries (cf. section
“Company Profile”). Responsible conduct — in business,
toward employees, in society and in dealing with the environ-
ment — is firmly anchored in Bertelsmann’s corporate culture.
In its corporate responsibility management, Bertelsmann pur-
sues the goal of reconciling its economic interests with social
and environmental concerns within the Group and beyond.

To identify relevant topics and describe concepts, the GRI
Standards 2016 specified by the Global Reporting Initiative
(in particular standards 102 and 103) were used to produce
the Group Non-Financial Statement. In addition, a voluntary
CR report based on the GRI Standards (2016; Option “core”)
will be published by the middle of the financial year.

Company Principles and Guidelines

The prerequisites for a corporate culture in which employees,
management and shareholders work together successfully,
respectfully and in a spirit of trust are common goals and
shared values. These are enshrined in the corporate consti-
tution and in the four Bertelsmann Essentials: partnership,
entrepreneurship, creativity and corporate citizenship.
Furthermore, the Bertelsmann Code of Conduct - as a binding
guideline — defines standards for law-abiding and ethically

40 Financial Information Combined Management Report

responsible conduct within the company and toward business
partners and the public. The sense of purpose embodied in
the triad “To Empower. To Create. To Inspire.” also provides
orientation for the company’s staff and partners.

Bertelsmann’s actions are also determined by external
guidelines. The company largely follows the recommendations
of the German Corporate Governance Code for good and
responsible corporate governance and the OECD Guidelines
for Multinational Enterprises. Bertelsmann is committed to the
principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights, and the International Labor Organization core labor
standards. Since 2008, Bertelsmann has also supported
the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact as
an active participant.

Corporate Responsibility Management
Organization

The advisory body for the strategic development of corporate
responsibility at Bertelsmann is the CR Council. The CR Council
is made up of the Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO)
and representatives from the corporate divisions and focuses
on the Group-wide CR objectives in line with the corporate
strategy and the cross-divisional coordination of CR activities
within the Group.

At the Group level, the Corporate Responsibility & Diversity
Management department coordinates and supports the work
of the CR Council in close cooperation with the other Group
functions. Within the decentralized Bertelsmann corporate
structure, the local management teams are responsible for
implementing corporate responsibility through specific CR
measures and projects. The corporate divisions and companies
have their own structures and processes in place for this, in
accordance with local requirements.

Topics

To identify key CR topics, Bertelsmann carries out regular CR
relevance analyses. In 2017, the company conducted a survey
of internal and external stakeholders. The external stakeholders
estimated the impact of Bertelsmann’s business activity on
the topics, while the internal stakeholders assessed their
business relevance. This made it possible to identify topics of
relevance to Bertelsmann relating to environmental, social and
employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption


--- Page 38 ---

and bribery matters. The topics are analyzed within the
company boundaries, unless otherwise stated.

Corporate responsibility topics, including non-financial per-
formance indicators, are not part of Bertelsmann’s value-
oriented management system. Due to limited measurability,
no directly quantifiable statements can be made regarding
relevant interdependencies and value increases for the Group.
For this reason, the non-financial performance indicators are
not used for the management of the Group (cf. section “Value-
Oriented Management System”).

Risks

A number of risks associated with CR topics are relevant for
Bertelsmann. These risks can arise from the company’s own
business activities or from its business relationships, and can
affect the company or its environment and stakeholders.

For the non-financial matters defined in the German “CSR
Directive Implementation Act” — environmental, social and
employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption
and bribery matters — no significant risks were reported as
part of the 2017 reporting.

For an analysis of the risks that are relevant for Bertelsmann,
please see the “Risks and Opportunities” section.

Employee Matters

Motivated employees ensure long-term quality, innovation
and growth. HR work at Bertelsmann is therefore based on
the company’s cooperative identity as codified in the corporate
constitution and the Bertelsmann Essentials. Supplementary
regulations are specified in Executive Board guidelines on
HR work. The CHRO is primarily responsible for dealing with
employee matters within the company. He works closely with
the HR managers from the corporate divisions who report
directly to him via a dotted-line concept. This cooperation is
supported by other bodies such as the HR Committee, con-
sisting of the CHRO and representatives from the corporate
divisions and the HR Country Coordination Meetings (with the
HR managers of the largest subsidiaries — or the subsidiaries
with the largest number of employees in the region in question).
Divisional Nomination & Compensation Committees decide
on the implementation of remuneration and staffing policies in
the respective areas of responsibility. In 2017, measures were
taken to address the following topics.

Participation

Bertelsmann sees continual dialogue between employees
and company management as a fundamental prerequisite to
the company’s success. As a media company, Bertelsmann
is free to determine its political direction as defined in the
German Works Constitutions Act (Tendenzschutz) and
in this respect is not subject to statutory codetermination
within the Supervisory Board. Nevertheless, the employees
have five members serving on the Supervisory Board of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA on a voluntary basis: four of
these are works council members and one is a member of
the Bertelsmann Management Representative Committee.
In addition, managers, general workforce, employees with
disabilities and trainees all have platforms for exchanging
ideas, advancing topics and voicing their concerns. The
Bertelsmann Group Dialogue Conference is an event where
the CEO, CHRO and members of the Corporate Works
Council can exchange ideas. Employees are also involved
in the development and improvement of working conditions
through standardized HR interview tools (Performance and
Development Dialogue, Agreements on Objectives, Team
Talk), as well as employee surveys. In 2017, measures were
derived at corporate, divisional and Group level from the
employee survey conducted in the previous year.

Learning

Highly trained employees are needed to overcome major
challenges such as the Group’s increasingly international
focus, the digital transformation of the media and service
landscape, and demographic change. By providing oppor-
tunities for lifelong learning, Bertelsmann helps to secure
the long-term employability of its employees. With four
different campuses — Strategy, Leadership, Function and
Individual —- Bertelsmann University is the central learning
organization within the company. The most important mea-
sures implemented in 2017 included the further develop-
ment of international programs in the areas of leadership,
strategy and creativity, and holding strategic summits for
the Group-wide finance, HR and IT community. In addition,
2017 saw the launch of a global Data Science Initiative
and the continued integration of digital learning content in
the various training and degree courses that Bertelsmann
offers in Germany.

Diversity

For Bertelsmann, diversity of its workforce is a prerequisite
for creativity, innovation and long-term business success.

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2017 4)


--- Page 39 ---

The diversity strategy focuses on the aspects of gender,
generations and nationality. The proportion of women in
Bertelsmann talent pools (top management, senior manage-
ment, career development) shall be increased. This was
already considered in the 2017 talent pool nominations.
The diversity strategy is implemented by the Corporate
Responsibility & Diversity Management department with
support from a Group-wide Diversity Working Group. In 2017,
the primary focus was on realizing the recommendations from
the Bertelsmann Diversity Conference 2016. These included
piloting diversity training, management qualifications from
Bertelsmann University and taking into account diversity
aspects in Corporate Talent Management.

Health

With a view to designing a health-promoting work environ-
ment and preventing work-related risks of disease,
Bertelsmann is expanding a systematic health manage-
ment system at German locations. Bertelsmann Health
Management has been put in charge of supervising and
coordinating the Germany-wide health strategy and asso-
ciated activities, in conjunction with a cross-functional
strategy group. The cross-divisional “Health Community,”
which is comprised of health experts, works council chairs,
Supervisory Board members, HR managers and representa-
tives for employees with disabilities, plays a key role here.
Through targeted networking, it also helps to reinforce
uniform standards that Bertelsmann Health Management
is seeking to apply to all German locations. In the medium
term, the
Management shall continue.

internationalization of Bertelsmann Health

Fair Working Conditions

At Bertelsmann, remuneration issues are an essential part of
the topic of fair working conditions. The policy is to establish
consistent and transparent remuneration structures in the
Group. The design of the compensation system is intended
to ensure that remuneration is driven by market, function
and performance, taking into account business-specific
characteristics. Employee profit sharing in Germany is based
on the same criteria as those used to calculate variable
remuneration components for Executive Board members and
executives. This includes Bertelsmann and subsidiaries based
in Germany, except RTL Group and Gruner + Jahr. These and
many foreign subsidiaries have similar success and profit-
sharing models adapted to local requirements. In 2017, a
total of €105 million of the 2016 profits was distributed as
part of such schemes.

42 Financial Information Combined Management Report

Social Matters

Corporate citizenship is one of the Bertelsmann Essentials and
is thus firmly anchored in Bertelsmann’s corporate culture.
As a good corporate citizen, Bertelsmann is committed to
contributing to society and implemented measures in the
following areas in 2017.

Press Freedom

Bertelsmann stands for the freedom of the press and
therefore a wide variety of opinions and positions. The
Bertelsmann Code of Conduct defines freedom of speech
and opinion and creative independence as a basic principle
of the Group's business activities. Bertelsmann interprets
this independence in two directions: Inside the company, it
means that our management does not attempt to influence
the decisions of artists, editors and program managers, or
to restrict their artistic or editorial freedom. In accordance
with the Bertelsmann “Editor-in-chief Principle,” editorial
decisions are the sole responsibility of the program managers.
To the outside, this means that the company does not
capitulate to political or economic influence in its journalistic
coverage, and complies with existing laws regarding the
separation of editorial content and commercial advertising.
In addition to the Bertelsmann Code of Conduct, many
companies and editors in 2017 continued to implement
separate statutes to safeguard journalistic independence in
their day-to-day business and to develop these further where
necessary. These statutes focus primarily on journalistic
and editorial duties of care, respect for privacy, and dealing
with the representation of violence and the protection
of minors.

Content Responsibility

Bertelsmann reflects on the repercussions of the content it
produces and distributes to protect the rights and interests
of media users and customers as far as possible. Overriding
principles and guidelines of media ethics are set by national
and international laws governing the press, broadcasting and
multimedia; by voluntary commitments to external guide-
lines such as the ethics codes of national press councils; and
within the company by the Bertelsmann Code of Conduct
and editorial statutes. With it, Bertelsmann’s editorial staff
are committed to, among other things, “respecting privacy
and the responsible treatment of information, opinion and
images.” In accordance with the “Editor-in-chief Principle,”
the responsibility for media content lies solely with the
program managers in the local editorial teams.


--- Page 40 ---

In the area of youth media protection, content is monitored
at Bertelsmann in accordance with different circulations for
each medium and region to see if it could adversely affect
the development of children or young people. Various restric-
tions come into force, such as broadcasting time restrictions
or labeling content and/or products. Through voluntary labeling
systems, Bertelsmann sometimes goes beyond the existing
European and national regulations, particularly in the broad-
casting industry. Other specifications relating to content
responsibility are agreed through supplementary statutes at
the divisional, company and editorial level.

Customer Data Protection

Bertelsmann attaches great importance to protecting cus-
tomer data. This includes safeguarding the personal data of
individual customers, as well as information about customers
that is provided to Bertelsmann by its business partners. The
objective of customer data protection is to protect an individ-
ual’s right to determine who acquires what knowledge about
them, and when. This also means that personal information,
or information that could identify a person, must be handled in
accordance with legal requirements and adequately protected
against unauthorized access. In addition to the Bertelsmann
Code of Conduct, customer data protection within the
company is regulated by Executive Board guidelines on the
topics of information security and IT risk management.

The Executive Board Guideline on Data Protection
addresses the data protection framework conditions at
Bertelsmann Group based on the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR), which will be applicable from May 25,
2018, and is designed to ensure consistent data protection
management across the Bertelsmann Group. To support
this, a data protection management system was rolled out
across the Group in the third quarter of 2017. It addresses the
documentation and accountability obligations under GDPR,
as well as regulations concerning governance obligations.

Responsibility for customer data protection is decentralized
and rests with the management of the individual subsidiaries.
To ensure compliance with local laws governing customer data
protection, the subsidiaries in Germany have a data protection
organization consisting of central data protection officers and
local data protection coordinators. The latter report to the
local management, as well as annually or on an event-driven
basis to the central data protection officers, who in turn report
to the Bertelsmann Executive Board. A similar organization
exists in subsidiaries outside Germany. An information security
management system (ISMS) based on industry standard

ISO 27001 creates the technical framework for confidential
data processing. The ISMS features a regular and structured
survey to ensure compliance with statutory information
security requirements, a systematic recording of risks and the
derivation of related mitigation measures.

Protecting Intellectual Property

Bertelsmann’s businesses develop, produce, transfer, license,
and sell products and services that are protected as intellec-
tual property. For Bertelsmann, the protection of intellectual
property rights is the foundation of its business success. For
this reason, the company is committed to a high level of global
copyright protection worldwide and in the digital world. The
Group-wide Taskforce Copyright, with representatives from
the relevant corporate divisions, supports current develop-
ments in copyright and summarizes its positions in the form
of joint papers.

Respect for Human Rights

Through its corporate principles and its voluntary commitment
to external guidelines, Bertelsmann is committed to respecting
and protecting human rights within the company and in its
business relationships. For this reason, the Bertelsmann
Executive Board established an Integrity & Compliance program
and appointed a Corporate Compliance Committee (CCC). The
CCC submits an annual Compliance Report to the Bertelsmann
Executive Board and the Audit and Finance Committee. The
Integrity & Compliance (I&C) department was created to
manage the ongoing day-to-day work and is subordinated to
the CCC in the organization. |&C supports the CCC in fulfilling
its tasks and makes suggestions for necessary improvements
to the I&C program. I&C ensures that employees worldwide
are made aware of the key legal provisions and internal
company guidelines, including those concerning the respect
for human rights, and it implemented the training and
communication measures necessary for this in 2017.

Respect for human rights, particularly in respect to employees
and within the supply chain, is expressly stipulated by the
Bertelsmann Code of Conduct and the Supplier Code of Conduct.
This includes the ban on child and coercive labor and the
ban on discrimination and intimidation, and it reaffirms the
right to freedom of association and the right to engage in
collective bargaining. In addition, individual subsidiaries and
Bertelsmann itself issued statements in 2017 in accordance
with the “UK Modern Slavery Act” that condemn all forms

of modern slavery, coercive and child labor, and exploitation
and discrimination, and present measures to prevent these
human rights violations. These statements are revised each
year (as required). At Bertelsmann, violations of this principle
may be reported by employees and by third parties via the
reporting channels within the existing compliance manage-
ment system. In terms of antidiscrimination, contact persons
for Germany's “General Equal Treatment Act” (AGG) have
been appointed at all German locations. Employees can
contact them in the event of suspected breaches of said act.
The employees are informed of their rights under AGG and
given corresponding training through a wide range of
communication channels. The topic of antidiscrimination
was addressed in a Group-wide e-learning program designed
to build employee awareness of the issue and advise them
of their rights.

Anti-corruption and Bribery Matters

Both the Bertelsmann Code of Conduct and the Bertelsmann
guidelines expressly prohibit all forms of corruption and
bribery. This prohibition also applies to all third parties that
work for, with or on behalf of Bertelsmann, as stipulated in
the Supplier Code of Conduct. Along with instructions for
dealing with officials, and guidelines for the granting or
accepting of gifts in the context of business relations, the
anti-corruption and integrity guideline prescribes appropriate
due diligence processes in dealing with third parties. An
appropriate due diligence review is carried out for each indi-
vidual risk profile through a corresponding risk classification.
This Executive Board guideline also describes the channels
for reporting suspected violations and seeking advice, as
well as other prevention and control measures. The Executive
Board guideline for dealing with alleged compliance viola-
tions anchors an obligation to report suspected violations of
the prohibition of corruption to the Bertelsmann Corporate
Center. The topic of corruption prevention is globally
managed and further developed by the I&C department. One
of the most important measures in 2017 was advising and
training executives and employees on anticorruption and
the design and initiation of the Group-wide rollout of a new
e-learning program on this topic.

Fair Competition and Antitrust Law

Bertelsmann is committed to the principle of fair competition and
condemns antitrust violations and anticompetitive behavior.
The company acts against any contravention and consults
internal or external experts on antitrust and competition issues.
The Bertelsmann Executive Board has approved a “Group
Guideline for Compliance with Antitrust Regulations.” There is
an obligation to report any antitrust violations. The Corporate
Legal Department offers antitrust training programs to corporate
divisions and the management and employees of these
divisions. A comprehensive compulsory training program for
employees working in antitrust-related areas, which was also
implemented in 2017, is intended to identify antitrust risks at
an early stage and to prevent antitrust violations.

Environmental Matters

The Bertelsmann Environmental Policy and the Bertelsmann
Paper Policy provide the framework for the responsible use of
natural resources throughout the Group, as well as environ-
mentally friendly energy and material procurement. The
environmental commitment extends beyond the individual
locations to the supply chain, in particular by influencing
paper suppliers and energy firms. Operational responsibility
for energy and environmental management and for imple-
menting the measures adopted in 2017 is decentralized and
rests with the management of the individual companies. An
international “Be Green” Working Group with representatives
from the Bertelsmann corporate divisions again provided a
platform for cross-divisional exchange on environmental
topics in 2017. In the medium term, the cooperation will
focus on increasing the use of paper from certified or recycled
sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from
the consumption of energy, heat and fuels. Experts from
the “Be Green” Working Group also coordinate the annual
collection of environmental key figures, which not only create
transparency about impacts on the environment and climate
as well as about Bertelsmann’s environmental performance,
but also enable the management to derive measures for
improvement. The Group-wide environmental key figures are
published on the Bertelsmann website.
