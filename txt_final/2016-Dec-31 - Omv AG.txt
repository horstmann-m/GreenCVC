About OMV

OMV is producing and marketing oil & gas, innovative energy and high-end petrochemical solutions —
in a responsible way. The history of OMV began more than 60 years ago on July 3, 1956, when

the company then known as “Osterreichische Mineralélverwaltung Aktiengesellschaft” was officially
entered into the commercial register. Over the past six decades, OMV has grown into Austria’s

largest industrial company with an international focus - developing from a state-owned company into
an international player with Group sales of over EUR 19 bn and more than 22,000 people from

69 nations in 28 countries.

In the Upstream Business Segment, OMV focuses
on the exploration, development and production
of oil and gas in four core regions: (1) Central and
Eastern Europe, (2) the North Sea, (3) the Middle
East and Africa and (4) Russia. At the end of 2016,
OMV Upstream was active in 15 countries across
the globe and had proven reserves (1P) of

1.03 bn boe and proven and probable reserves
(2P) of 1.7 bn boe. The Reserve Replacement Rate
(RRR) was 101% in 2016. Daily production was
311 kboe/d in 2016, which equals a total production
of 113.8 mn boe. Around 90% of its production

in 2016 came from EU/OECD countries. Oil and gas
production is roughly even, at about 50% each.
OMV is optimizing its portfolio to focus on low-cost
regions and high-value projects. The Company
has an excellent track record in exploiting mature
basins and uses the latest technologies in order

to increase the recovery rates and produce oil and
gas at low costs in a responsible way.

The Downstream Business Segment consists of the
Downstream Oil and the Downstream Gas business.

Our value chain

Downstream Oil operates three refineries:
Schwechat (Austria) and Burghausen (southern
Germany), both of which feature integrated petro-
chemical production, and the Petrobrazi refinery
(Romania), which mainly processes Romanian
crude. OMV has an annual processing capacity of
17.8 mn t. The retail network consists of 3,777 fill-
ing stations in 11 countries with a strong multi-
brand portfolio. In addition to this and alongside an
efficient commercial business, OMV has a leading
position in its Downstream Oil markets. In Down-
stream Gas, the natural gas sales volume was
109 TWh in 2016. OMV operates a gas pipeline net-
work in Austria and four gas storage facilities

with a capacity of 2.7 bcm (30 TWh). The Central
European Gas Hub (CEGH) is a well-established
gas-trading platform. The node in Baumgarten
(Austria) is Central Europe’s largest entry and gas
distribution point for Russian gas. OMV operates
two gas-fired power plants, one in Romania and
one in Turkey.

OMV Aktiengesellschaft is Austria’s largest listed
industrial company with a market capitalization of
EUR 11 bn at the end of 2016.

Strategy

OMV made significant progress in restructuring the business portfoli

in 2016 and its strategic road

map 2020 focuses on value-added growth. This is underlined by strict financial discipline.

Market perspective

The underlying assumption of our strategy is that
oil and gas will continue to play a pivotal role

as primary global energy supply sources in the
coming decades, in line with forecasts of leading
global energy institutes, such as the International
Energy Agency. Oil will dominate in transport, and
both oil and gas will remain major feedstocks for
the petrochemical industry. Gas, as the fossil fuel
with the lowest carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions,
will continue to play an important role in the energy
mix of the future. In terms of long-term fuel effi-
ciency, technical evolution of alternative power
trains and developments in the regulatory environ-
ment may alter the consumption patterns.

Oil markets have been characterized by significant
oversupply in 2016. Overall, market analysts are
forecasting an increase in the oil price in 2017
compared to 2016. In the longer term, towards the
end of the decade, an oil supply shortfall may
appear, if substantial amounts for investment are
cancelled or postponed as a reaction to the oil price
drop. The underlying assumption is that oil prices
will rise again towards the end of the decade. The
short-term flexibility of US shale oil, however,
will likely act as a price cap, so oil prices are not
expected to rise to the levels of USD 100/bb! and
higher as seen between 2011 and 2014. OMV’s cur-
rent long-term oil price assumption is USD 75/bbl
from 2020 onwards.

Within the last few years, European gas markets
have turned into a state of constant oversupply
due to an abundance of available supply and slower
than expected demand developments. The over-
supply situation is expected to stay until the end
of the decade with modest demand growth and
new Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) supply volumes
expected. European indigenous production is ex-
pected to decline further. The European gas price
will be shaped by how accommodating Europe’s
traditional suppliers are towards any additional
LNG volumes and, secondly, by how fast indige-
nous production declines. OMV’s gas price assump-
tions have been aligned to reflect the current
weaker European market conditions.

In the refining business, margins are projected to
continue their downward trend. Europe has too
much refining capacity, and competitive middle
distillates imports (e.g. diesel) are supplied from
Russia and the Middle East. Finally, the US as a
traditional export market for European oil products
has all but disappeared for now due to the shale
oil revolution. Strong competition is expected to
continue in Europe. While gasoline demand from
China, India and recently the US is lively, demand
in Europe is expected to decrease as a result of
increasing efficiency and further shifts towards
alternative fuels based on ambitious climate targets.
Economic activity, commercial road traffic and
dieselization of private cars are the main drivers for
diesel demand in Europe. Higher growth potential
for emerging markets, but only limited demand
increase in mature markets, is anticipated. In the
medium to long term, efficiency gains and a chang-
ing market environment with higher shares of
alternative fuels will finally result in a decrease in
consumption. For jet fuel, the market outlook

is positive based on increases in both passenger
and cargo traffic. Demand for petrochemical
products is expected to stay healthy with a positive
long-term trend.

Strategic restructuring in 2016

OMV leveraged its strengths in the challenging
business environment of 2016 and delivered major
achievements in restructuring its portfolio.

Streamlined portfolio

In Upstream, OMV successfully closed the divest-
ment of 30% in the pre-FID project Rosebank (UK)
to Suncor Energy as well as the divestment of
OMV (U.K.) Limited to Siccar Point Energy. In Nor-
way, OMV divested its 20% share in Zidane. These
divestments will generate more than USD 1.2 bn in
proceeds (including contingent payments). In addi-
tion, OMV substantially reduced its investment
plan in the North Sea, freeing up funds for invest-
ments in low-cost regions. OMV will continue to
investigate ways to further optimize the Upstream
portfolio.

OMV achieved the goal of a 100% RRR in 2016 by
adding 118 mn boe 1P reserves. Pearl Petroleum
Company and our expansion in Libya contributed
significantly to this increase. OMV holds a

10% share in Pearl, an operator of gas fields in the
Kurdistan region of Iraq. Arbitration proceedings
confirmed the entitlement to existing production
and 1P reserves. In Libya, OMV expanded its
position in the Sirte Basin.

Major achievements in reshaping OMV’s portfolio

In the gas transportation business, OMV sold 49%
of Gas Connect Austria to a consortium of Snam
and Allianz in 2016. The total cash consideration of
EUR 601 mn paid by the consortium contributed

to the Group’s financial stability. Through the divest-
ment of tail-end filling stations in the Czech Re-
public and the acquisition of unmanned filling sta-
tions in Austria, the retail network has been further
optimized in order to secure the captive outlet

and support the refinery utilization. As OMV Petrol
Ofisi was a non-integrated retail station network,
the divestment decision was made in February 2016.
On March 3, 2017, OMV has agreed to sell OMV
Petrol Ofisi to VIP Turkey Enerji AS for an overall
transaction value of EUR 1.368 bn.

OMV reinforced its divestment efforts for the
Dorobantu wind park (Romania) and Samsun
power plant (Turkey), although the current market
environment is challenging.

Gas sales and trading businesses integrated
OMV successfully restructured Downstream Gas,
a business confronted with significant adverse
market changes in the past years. OMV took over
the remaining shares in EconGas in May 2016
and subsequently integrated the company. OMV
implemented several steps — such as reorgani-
zation, settlement of legacy contracts, lifting of
synergies and rebranding - to place the gas sales
business on a sound foundation.

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / COMPANY

Cost savings achieved and cash breakeven
reduced

Capital expenditure was cut by 32% in 2016 versus
2015, from EUR 2.8 bn in 2015 to EUR 1.9 bn in
2016. Exploration & Appraisal (E&A) expenditure
was reduced by 49% in 2016 versus 2015. In total,
E&A was reduced from EUR 607 mn in 2015 to
EUR 307 mn in 2016. E&A expenditure will be
limited to EUR 300 mn going forward. Group-wide
sustainable cost reduction and efficiency improve-
ments of about EUR 200 mn in 2016 compared

to 2015 were achieved. For 2017, OMV targeted the
achievement of a neutral free cash flow, after
dividends, at an estimated oil price of around
USD 55/bbI. This goal was already reached in 2016
due to the launch of a cost reduction and capital
efficiency program. The 2016 free cash flow after
dividends break-even oil price was USD 35/bbl
(excluding divestment proceeds).

Value-added growth

The strategic road map of OMV focuses on value-
added growth until 2020 and will deliver oil & gas,
innovative energy and high-end petrochemical
solutions to our customers in a responsible way.

Upstream: value over volume

OMV focuses the Upstream activities on four core
regions (1) CEE, (2) the North Sea, (3) the Middle
East and Africa and (4) Russia. A core region is
defined as having an annual production rate above
50 kboe/d and being self-funded. Furthermore,
OMV will target acquisitions in regions with attrac-
tive cost positions, like the Middle East and Russia,
to reduce its portfolio cost. In the process of
shifting its portfolio to low-cost regions offering
ample opportunities for reserve replenishment,
OMV leverages on a series of long-term strategic
partnerships.

In December 2016, OMV signed a binding Basic
Agreement with Gazprom regarding the envisaged
asset swap. Gazprom will receive a 38.5% stake

in OMV Norge, and in exchange OMV will receive
a 24.98% share in Achimov IV/V in Russia. The deal
remains subject to an agreement on the final trans-
action documents and regulatory and further
corporate approvals. The swap transaction would
add approximately 560 mn boe to OMV's reserves,
making a significant contribution to the develop-
ment of OMV's RRR. The field will begin production
towards the end of the decade and will deliver
high-plateau production for more than 20 years.

On March 5, 2017, OMV signed an agreement

to acquire a 24.99% share in the Yuzhno Russkoye
natural gas field located in Western Siberia

from Uniper SE. The purchase price amounts to
USD 1,850 mn. The transaction is anticipated to
close by the end of 2017 and will be retroactively
effective as of January 1, 2017. The implementation
of the transaction is subject to further conditions,
including co-shareholder consent as well as merger
control and foreign investment control clearance

in Russia. OMV's share of the remaining recover-
able reserves during the license term (lasting until
the end of the year 2043) amounts to approxi-
mately 580 mn boe. OMV's share of the daily pro-
duction is estimated to be 100,000 boe/d.

OMV will focus to extend its footprint in the Middle
East and Africa as a second low-cost production
region. In the United Arab Emirates, OMV seeks to
engage in further opportunities beyond the current
position in the gas field Shuwaihat and the evalu-
ation of oil and gas fields North-West Offshore
Abu Dhabi in close cooperation with its long-term
partner ADNOC. In Iran, OMV has intensified its
cooperation with the National Iranian Oil Company,
signing a MoU concerning the evaluation of various
fields in the Zagros area in the west of Iran for
potential future development. In addition, the
companies signed a joint study agreement for the
evaluation of the potential hydrocarbon prospect
in the Fars area. In Libya, OMV increased its

stake in four Exploration and Production Sharing
Agreements in the Sirte Basin and strengthened
the partnership with the National Oil Corporation
(NOC). Subject to improvements in the security
situation, the transaction will provide OMV with an
opportunity to increase its production in Libya to

a maximum of 50,000 bbi/d. OMV increased its
2P developed reserves in Libya by 52 mn bbl. In
partnerships, OMV leverages the technological
strength of exploiting mature basins based on op-
erational excellence as demonstrated in Romania
and Austria.

OMV targets an RRR of 100%; that is, full replace-
ment of produced reserves. The direction going
forward is to further optimize the portfolio in terms
of value and cash contribution and shift the
production level above 400 kboe/d in the long-
term perspective.

Downstream
integration will
be further
strengthened

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / COMPANY

Downstream Gas: expand European gas sales
The gas sales offensive in Northwest Europe is
gaining momentum through the newly opened
sales office in Germany. Contracted gas volumes
amounted to ~17 TWh, which exceed the target
volume for 2017. The increasing marketing volumes
in Northwest Europe will also allow for better
utilization of infrastructure positions, and earning
the associated fixed costs. The sales offensive

is supported by our considerable marketing exper-
tise and well-established position as a market
leader in Austria.

In the non-regulated gas transportation business,
OMV intended to participate in the Nord Stream 2
project. However, due to a statement of objection
received by the Polish merger control authorities,
the consortium withdrew the merger control notifi-
cation and terminated the shareholder and share
purchase agreements in August 2016. Currently,
alternative options to support the project are under
evaluation. Nord Stream 2 remains strategically
important to OMV as it ensures continuous long-
term gas flows to the Central European Gas Hub
(CEGH) and through the network of Gas Connect
Austria. This, in turn, secures the long-term utiliza-
tion of the Austrian gas import and export infra-
structure operated by Gas Connect Austria.

Downstream Oil: extend refinery value chain

In 2016, Downstream Oil once again proved its
value as a cash generator. Going forward, the busi-
ness will continue to be run for cash, adhering to
strict capital and cost discipline. To optimally uti-
lize OMV's three refineries, the integration with
Upstream and captive outlets will be maintained
and further strengthened. These comprise OMV's
retail station network and the petrochemicals in-
tegration with Borealis at the Schwechat and Burg-
hausen refineries. A currently evaluated cracker
expansion in Burghausen will further strengthen
the relationship with Borealis and OMV's petro-
chemical integration. Today, roughly one-third of
the refinery capacity is sold via our retail network
and another 13% through the petrochemicals
channel. Moreover, an incremental optimization

of refinery output will be achieved via the upgrade
of lower value LPG into higher value distillates in
the Petrobrazi refinery.

54

OMV’'s petrochemicals integration with Borealis
plays a pivotal role in securing the long-term
position of OMV’s refineries in Schwechat and Burg-
hausen. OMV will continue its efforts to nurture
and increase the prolific relationship with Borealis
to deliver high-end petrochemical solutions.

All forms of energy will be needed to meet grow-
ing global demand. Therefore OMV leverages three
value drivers for innovative energy: new feedstocks
(e.g. produce synthetic crude from plastic waste),
new technologies (e.g. hydrogen from renewable
energy) and new products (e.g. hydrogen mobility).

CO Further details can be found in the Innovation and
New Technologies chapter of this report

Financial discipline

One key principle of OMV’s financial management
is ensuring financial discipline. OMV’s financial
steering framework is based on the following
principles: offer an attractive shareholder return,
provide predictable dividend streams, and main-
tain a strong investment grade rating. OMV aims
to sustain a long-term gearing ratio below 30%
to maintain a strong balance sheet. Therefore, this
framework consists of two main pillars: value
creation and cash flow. The key financial indicators
to measure value creation in both absolute and
relative terms are economic value added and
ROACE. These KPIs ensure a focus on profitable
investments as well as on efficient capital expen-
diture management and operational efficiency.

A strong free cash flow is essential for value gener-
ation, as it gives headroom for investments and
ensures attractive dividends. Diligent management
of both operating cash flow as well as investment
levels form the foundation of the framework.

OMV's financial steering framework stands for risk-
monitored, value-added growth for the Company
and its stakeholders.

Innovation and New Technologies

n efforts are focused on implementing ideas that will bring benefits to OMV customers,
the environment and the Company. Innovation and new technologies help our Business Segments
to extend their core expertise and achieve high product quality and service standards. For
improving the sustainable development of the business, environment and society, OMV fosters
strategic partnerships with universities, research institutions and selected industrial partners.

Group expenses for innovation and new technologies amounted to EUR 28.4 mn in 2016.

Upstream

In the Upstream business, the addition of reserves
through the increase of ultimate recovery rates

of mature assets is a key pillar of reserve replenish-
ment besides exploration and acquisition. OMV
focuses on water management, steam injection
and polymer injection to unlock additional reserves
in mature fields.

In 2016, OMV added an additional injector to the
polymer pilot project, which is ongoing in Austria
since 2012. In total, 100,000 boe incremental oil
was produced by the end of 2016.

A research project with Stanford University was
launched to increase OMV’s reservoir simulation
capabilities, forming the basis for better reservoir
performance management through improved
forecasting.

Since 2015, OMV has further intensified the
Research & Development (R&D) cooperations with
Statoil, Total and Gazprom. Together with Total,
OMV continued to work on the industrial-scale
testing of innovative technologies in produced
water treatment. The handling of back-produced
polymers is one of the key aspects that enable
cost-efficient polymer injection. Through this collab-
oration, the polymer handling capability in back-
produced water could be significantly improved.

In October 2016, OMV signed an agreement for
scientific and technical partnership with Gazprom,
Montanuniversitat Leoben and the Gubkin Russian
State University of Oil & Gas. As one of the key
areas, the collaboration will focus on technologies
to reduce the water cut, a key challenge to produce
mature oil fields.

The very close collaboration for developing and
testing new technologies with the Montanuniversi-
tat Leoben continued in 2016. Topics of projects
covered a wide area from increasing the run time
of artificial lift equipment and rock mechanics to
polymer injection.

56

Downstream

In the Downstream business, OMV leverages three
value drivers in the innovation approach: new
feedstocks, new technologies and new products.

In 2016, OMV prepared the first scale-up step from
a bench scale unit to a pilot plant for a project,
which uses plastic waste to produce a synthetic
crude in a pyrolysis process. This recycled crude can
be processed into any desired refinery product,
while reducing the dependence on fossil resources
and improving carbon intensity. The mechanical
completion of the new pilot plant is expected at the
end of 2017.

OMV continued its development efforts in the
co-processing of renewable feedstocks. For tradi-
tional biofuel mixtures, the biogenic component is
added to the fuel after production. Co-processing
introduces the biogenic raw material into the
production process. In March 2016, a first field test
with rapeseed oil was successfully completed
including a sustainability certification according to
REDcert standard. For 2017, further field testing

is planned with a focus on increasing the bio yield
and volume.

The goal of the wind2hydrogen project is to set
up the conditions required to produce “green
hydrogen” from renewable electricity, which can
be stored, transported or used whenever it is
convenient for customers. The pilot plant in Auers-
thal (Austria) will continue to study dynamic
hydrogen production until the end of 2017. As a
pioneer in hydrogen mobility, OMV opened the
third hydrogen filling station in Austria in 2016.
OMV is a joint venture partner in the H2 MOBILITY
initiative, whose goal is to open around 400
hydrogen filling stations in Germany by the end
of 2023.

OMV is also preparing options for the long-term
future. At the Christian Doppler Laboratory

in Cambridge, Erwin Reisner and his team are
researching ways to convert sunlight into usable
energy syngas. The research team aims to
develop a prototype of a reactor to produce larger
amounts of hydrogen by the end of the decade.

Sustainability and Health, Safety, Security and Environment

At OMV, we have a long tradition of responsible behavior towards the environment and society.
We aim at providing energy for the sustainable development of society, the environment, and the
economy alike. OMV is strongly committed to acting on climate change mitigation and therefore
set new targets in 2016 to manage and reduce the carbon footprint of our operations and products.
Furthermore, OMV ran an efficient community engagement program in the operating countries.

OMV sustainability strategy

Responsible business behavior is crucial for
OMV to create win-win situations for society, the
environment and the Company, to secure the
social acceptance of business operations, to gain
access to new resources and to attract the best
employees, contractors and investors.

The OMV sustainability strategy Resourcefulness
brings together our commitments on health, safety,
security, environment, business ethics, human
rights, diversity and stakeholder engagement. It is
based on three pillars:

> Eco-Efficiency: efficient use of resources
and the reduction of environmental impact
through energy efficient projects, carbon
and water management and of gas as the
cleanest fossil fuel

> Eco-Innovation: invest in research and
development of new technologies and energy
sources to meet the challenges of tomorrow
through hydrogen mobility projects or second-
generation biofuels

> Skills to Succeed: develop the local economy
to mitigate risks through vocational training
(with a focus on technology and women), local
employment, local supplier development
and strategic cooperation with universities

Sustainability governance

Sustainability is managed and overseen by two
governance bodies: The Resourcefulness Executive
Team (RET) (chaired by the CEO) reviews and
approves all sustainability-related projects and
progress of implementation. The Resourcefulness
Advisory Board (RAB) (chaired by the CEO) com-
prises high-ranking international experts with
academic backgrounds and expertise in the areas
of sustainability.

The RAB met twice in 2016 and provided expert
advice and recommendations on topics such as
priorities for sustainability in a low-oil-price
environment, sustainability and the capital market
and climate change. Some topics raised during
the RAB meetings have been proactively imple-
mented by OMV already. The endorsement of the
World Bank's “Zero routine flaring by 2030” initia-
tive and the new greenhouse gas intensity target
serve as beacons within the oil and gas industry.

World Bank's initiative
“Zero routine flaring
by 2030” endorsed

Methods and measuring tools that monitor and
capture the effects of Resourcefulness enable
OMV to make the best decisions for OMV, the envi-
ronment and our stakeholders. OMV continued
during 2016 to monitor and steer the performance
of the sustainability activities through the Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs). The KPls are also
aligned with the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). Through the projects
and initiatives, we support all 17 SDGs.

( More details about performance with regard to
the selected sustainability KPIs can be found in the
stand-alone OMV Sustainability Report 2016.

Environmental, Social and Governance
(ESG) performance

At OMV, we place great importance in working with
the ESG rating agencies. This helps us drive the
sustainability agenda forward and to make con-
tinuous improvements. In 2016, OMV has achieved
an outstanding score of “A-” (leadership) for CDP
Climate Change and Water, stating that the “com-
pany has taken steps that represent best practice
in the field of environmental, carbon and water
management.” With these results, OMV is among
the best in the global oil and gas sector, is the
index/sector leader in Austria for climate change
score and is the global water score leader in the
energy sector.

OMV achieved
leadership status for
CDP Climate Change
and Water

Furthermore, OMV maintained its inclusion during
2016 in the FTSE4Good Global, STOXX® Global ESG
and MSCI Global Sustainability indices, as well as
Euronext-Vigeo Eurozone 120 and Ethibel Sustain-
ability Excellence Europe.

Reporting on materiality

In accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative
(GRI) G4 core standard and following the oil and
gas sector supplements, OMV carried out a materi-
ality analysis to identify what matters most to us
and our stakeholders.

The analysis allowed us to group the material

issues into five distinctive areas and gave greater
clarity on what we need to focus on and report.

Our materiality matrix

This means that we disclose, with greater promi-
nence and detail, the issues ranked as being

of high importance for OMV and its stakeholders:
health and safety, oil spills, security, climate
change, employees, business ethics, human rights
and community relations. We continue to report
on topics regarded as of moderate or low impor-
tance but without the same level of detail.

In 2017, the analysis of materiality will be repeated.

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / COMPANY

Material areas

1. Health, safety and security

Health, safety and security are key values of OMV.
The physical and mental health, well-being and
safety of the people, as well as the integrity of OMV
operating facilities, are of essential importance.
Loss prevention and proactive risk management are
essential in maintaining OMV’s social acceptance
and to reach OMV's HSSE vision “ZERO harm —
NO losses.”

In 2016, the combined Lost-Time Injury Rate (LTIR)
for own employees and contractors was 0.40 (2015:
0.27), and our combined Total Recordable Injury
Rate (TRIR) was 0.69 (2015: 0.73).

We are deeply saddened to have lost one employee
and one contractor during 2016. In both cases, a
detailed incident investigation was conducted, and
measures have been implemented to prevent any
such recurrence.

An unstable geopolitical landscape with enduring
regional conflicts resulted in the security emphasis
for 2016 remaining primarily focused on the
Middle East and North Africa. Notwithstanding
the challenges of continuing to operate securely
in the distressed regions of Libya, Pakistan,
Tunisia, Turkey and Yemen, the threat and reality
of terrorist attacks on mainland Europe and else-
where increased significantly. OMV's established
crisis management and security travel manage-
ment procedures provided a reassuring degree of
mitigation and control during 2016.

Additional proactive measures were also initiated
to review and further enhance security at the head
office and all other critical infrastructure assets
against this emerging violent phenomenon.

Key safety actions in 2016

> Group-wide roll out of the Safety Culture
Program, safety culture evaluations and
training workshops in selected ventures

>» The campaign “On the safe side with good
ideas” generated 89 ideas for a healthier
and safer workplace

> Audits on incident investigation process
by external experts to find potential for
improvement

» Cross-branch office assessment of effective-
ness and completion of actions from fatalities
and high-potential incidents in Upstream

> Closer monitoring of the execution of safety-
critical activities resulting in a significant
decrease of overdue work orders for safety-
critical elements (>90% completed work
orders) in Upstream

2. Environmental management

OMV aims at optimizing processes to use
natural resources as efficiently as possible,
and to reduce emissions and discharges.

Key environmental actions in 2016

> Implementation of a new group-wide Environ-
mental Management Standard, introducing
a zero routine flaring and venting policy

» Endorsement of the World Bank initiative
“Zero routine flaring by 2030”

> Roll-out of a Corporate Environmental Risk
Assessment tool, which allows optimized data
handling, prioritization and action tracking

Spill risk management is another key focus across
OMV operations. In 2016, there were two major
hydrocarbon spills (Level 3-Level 5 according to
OMV definitions), totaling 39,500 | of hydrocarbons
spilled.

OMV is strongly committed to acting on climate
change mitigation and responsible resource man-
agement and has therefore set targets to manage
and reduce the carbon footprint of its operations
and products. The key target is to reduce OMV's
overall greenhouse gas emission intensity by 10%
by 2021 compared to 2013. Overall, savings of
more than 50,000 t CO, emissions were achieved
in 2016 at the refineries.

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / COMPANY

The phasing out of routine flaring and venting as
well as energy efficiency improvements across all
operations are essential measures to achieve the
target. OMV Refining, Gas Connect Austria and
OMV Petrom have an Energy Management System
certified according to ISO 50001.

On water management, the focus is on efficient
water use and state-of-the-art water treatment.
In 2016, OMV continued to implement the water
strategy with the main focus on the Group’s
primary water consumers. Water-related risks of
priority sites have been identified, and water
management plans have been developed. This will
be further rolled out at other relevant sites in 2017.

(1 Additional information on our environmental
performance data can be found in the stand-alone
OMV Sustainability Report 2016

3. Employee development and diversity

OMV is committed to the Group’s Diversity Strat-
egy and its focus on gender diversity and inter-
nationality. Regarding gender diversity, the target
is set to have 30% women in Senior Vice Presi-
dent positions by 2020. In the area of international-
ity, there are three KPls defined to focus on an
appropriate mix of local and non-local employees
within the management boards of the major

OMV entities and at the Senior Vice President level.
As of December 31, 2016, women held 23% of our
Senior Vice President positions and international
(non-Austrian) employees held 41%.

(I Additional information on diversity can be found
in the Consolidated Corporate Governance Report.
Details about the topic employee development
can be found in the chapter Employees.

4. Business ethics and human rights

OMV strives to uphold equally high compliance
standards in all locations. A dedicated cross-
regional compliance organization, consisting of
42 compliance experts, ensures that OMV standards
are consistently met across the Group. In 2016,
more than 2,100 employees were trained to ensure
compliance with internal as well as external
regulations and laws. OMV is a signatory of the
United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and

fully committed to the UN Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights. In 2016, OMV launched
a Human Rights e-learning tool, a mechanism
that guides OMV employees through norms and
situations that have to do with human rights.

60

5. Community relations and development

OMV has been successful in promoting the social
benefits of its operations while running an efficient
business in the countries of operation. In 2016,
the community grievance mechanism was fully
operational in Upstream. In addition, it was rolled
out in three OMV refineries. A grievance is an
expression of dissatisfaction stemming from a real
or perceived impact of the Company’s business
activities. With the new grievance mechanism sys-
tem in place, OMV has a consistent approach to
receiving, registering and solving the grievances
and is fully aligned with the requirements of the
GRI and IPIECA (International Petroleum Industry
Environmental Conservation Association). OMV
contributed to the economic development of the
communities where it has operations and con-
tinued to implement community projects. In 2016,
more than 3,700 external beneficiaries received
training and education for exploiting better eco-
nomic opportunities.

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / COMPANY

Employees

The year 2016 was one of transformation for OMV. We focused our attention on turning around our
overall portfolio and rethinking our current business model. Great improvements have been made

in reducing our cost levels, and this will require continuous attention to remain at the forefront of the
industry. In addition, significant leadership changes took place in 2016. The Executive Board came to its
current composition in the middle of the year when the new CFO joined.

Under the leadership of the Executive Board, OMV's
Purpose (the “Why”) and Business Reason (the
“What”) were defined along with Our Principles
(the “How”); they characterize the culture to which
OMV aspires and serve as the foundation for a
sustainable successful organization:

> Team spiri
as a team

> Accountability: act as if it were your own
company

> Passion: put your heart and mind into it

> Pioneering spirit: be open-minded and think
in alternatives

> Performance: strive for the best every day

: respect the individual and act

The Purpose, Business Reason and Principles were
first communicated to the Senior Leadership Team
in January 2017 and shortly after to the rest of the
organization.

Our Principles are the fundamentals of the newly
developed People Strategy.

OMV's People Strategy

The alignment of our people agenda with the busi-
ness strategy was very important in the year of
transformation. Cultural evolution, leadership and
understanding of future capabilities required for
the successful implementation of our strategy are
the main pillars of our People Strategy. The develop-
ment of internal talents and succession planning
are key for the long-term success of the Company.

Our strategic priorities to become an even stronger
organization are:

> Inspiring leaders: building high-performing,
diverse teams

> Performance-focused and principle-led
behavior: clear expectations and accountability

> Organizational agility and excellence: focus on
simple, smooth and efficient processes

> Great place to work: a place where people can
learn, grow, connect and collaborate

OMV’'s Human Resources (HR) road map for the
coming year has been developed to bring Our
Principles to life and to ensure that the change in
culture supports the company transformation
process with an even more engaged workforce.

Progress will regularly be monitored using engage-
ment and pulse surveys.

Highlights from 2016

Despite all the changes due to the transformation
of the business and HR, many more activities
were initiated to develop and motivate the existing
workforce.

Significant effort has been made to adjust the em-
ployee development programs to the changing
needs of the organization. There is a good balance
defined between learning on the job, internal
knowledge transfer, coaching and formal training.
Any new development programs that are to be de-
veloped and introduced in the future will fit into
this concept.

Since 2011, more
than 600 technical
graduates completed
the three-year

IGD program

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / COMPANY

Continuous time and effort are being invested to
keep the talent pipeline flowing, at the international
level as well as with a focus on female employees.
In 2016, OMV offered five scholarships to excellent
female technical students. Furthermore, OMV is
sponsoring master’s students from different uni-
versities. In 2016, six graduates from the petroleum
engineering program were hired from Montan-
universitat Leoben.

One of OMV's core training programs is the Inte-
grated Graduation Development (IGD), where new
technical graduates are trained over the course

of three years. Since 2011, more than 600 OMV
employees have been trained. Once again in 2016,
45 new graduates started the professional develop-
ment program.

Programs to develop critical skills in key areas of
OMV's business have been intensified. The Skill
Pool Management concept was also introduced to
the Upstream business and is a good example of
how OMV will anticipate the need for specific skills
and competencies in the future.

Management and leadership development is an-
other cornerstone of the People Strategy. In 2016,
two new leadership development programs were
launched. Job rotation and international assign-
ments for upcoming leaders accelerate participants’
development. This ensures the availability of great
leaders in the future. Currently, 90% of our senior
leaders have international experience, mostly
gained within the OMV Group.

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / COMPANY

Group Performance

OMV delivered a good operating result and increased its resilience in a volatile environment. Relying
on higher profitability per barrel and significant cost reductions, OMV has responded with a strategy
offensive that adjusts to a lower-oil-price environment. In 2016, OMV generated strong positive cash
flow performance both from operating activities as well as after investments and dividends. Ultimately,
OMV stands on solid financial footing. A well-balanced investment strategy and target-oriented cost

reductions lay the foundations for sustainable performance.

Results performance

In 2016, OMV achieved a clean CCS EBIT of

EUR 1,110 mn, showing a good operational result
despite the decrease in oil and gas prices and

in the refining margin. However, clean CCS EBIT
decreased by 20% as both Upstream and
Downstream turned in lower results. The Upstream
result decreased to EUR 26 mn due to sig
cantly lower oil and gas prices that could only
partially be offset by higher sales volumes, lower
exploration expenses and depreciation, as well

as lower production costs. The Downstream result
decreased to EUR 1,122 mn, impacted by a lower
refining margin, which was partly offset by an
improved Downstream Gas result. Clean EBIT for
the segment Corporate and Other amounted to
EUR (50) mn.

Negative net special items of EUR (1,574) mn were
recorded in 2016 (EUR (3,028) mn in 2015), mainly
attributable to the impairments in both Upstream
and Downstream assets. The main impairments

in Upstream were related to the divestments of
the 30% stake in the Rosebank field (EUR (543) mn)
and of OMV (U.K.) Limited (EUR (493) mn).

Key financials

In Downstream, special items were mainly related
to the impairment of the OMV Petrol Ofisi disposal
group of EUR (334) mn, following the reclassifica-
tion as an asset held for sale, as well as to the im-
pairment of Samsun power plant of EUR (101) mn
and of the Etzel gas storage facility of EUR (73) mn.
Positive CCS effects of EUR 6 mn were recognized
(2015: EUR (368) mn). The OMV Group’s reported
EBIT equaled EUR (457) mn, which is above 2015
(EUR (2,006) mn). The net financial result of

EUR 227 mn improved compared to EUR 97 mn

in 2015, mainly due to higher income from equity-
accounted investments and an improved net inter-
est result. Taxes on Group income of EUR 47 mn
were recognized in 2016. Non-controlling interests
amounted to EUR 118 mn (2015: EUR (197) mn)
and hybrid interests amounted to EUR 103 mn
(2015: EUR 42 mn).

Net income attributable to stockholders amounted
to EUR (403) mn in 2016 versus EUR (1,100) mn in
2015. Clean CCS net income attributable to stock-

holders equaled EUR 995 mn (2015: EUR 1,148 mn).
The corresponding clean CCS Earnings Per Share

amounted to EUR 3.05 (2015: EUR 3.52).

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / COMPANY

Cash flow performance

Cash flow from operating activities amounted

to EUR 2,878 mn and was slightly higher than in
2015 (EUR 2,834 mn). OMV delivered on its
strategic target to generate a positive free cash
flow after dividends. Free cash flow after dividends
resulted in a cash inflow of EUR 615 mn (2015:
outflow of EUR 569 mn), mainly due to lower in-
vestments. Free cash flow after dividends including
changes from non-controlling interests, which
reflects mainly the cash inflow from the divestment
of the 49% minority stake in Gas Connect Austria,
amounted to EUR 1,105 mn in 2016. OMV substan-
tially improved its resilience against a lower oil
price environment. Based on the cash flow from
operating activities of EUR 2,878 mn, the cash out-
flow for investments of EUR 2,141 mn and the cash
outflow for dividend payments of EUR 466 mn,
OMV showed a cash breakeven oil price of well
below USD 40/bbI in 2016.

Strict cost discipline

OMV's operational performance was the result of
the Group’s strict cost discipline. OMV made excel-
lent progress in the implementation of the cost
reduction and efficiency program. By the end of
2016, cost savings of EUR 200 mn were achieved:
EUR 100 mn more than targeted. This came as a
result of favorable contract renegotiations, process
optimizations and efficiency initiatives.

Upstream production cost decreased by 12% to
USD 11.6/boe, resulting from the successful imple-
mentation of the cost reduction program coupled
with higher production volumes. The cost reduction
measures mainly resulted in lower service, main-
tenance and personnel costs.

During the course of 2016, OMV also reduced its
capital expenditure by 32% to EUR 1.9 bn. OMV
has also focused on exploration mostly in low-cost
regions and near-field opportunities in 2016. As a
result, Exploration and Appraisal expenditures
were reduced from EUR 607 mn to EUR 307 mn.

Outlook 2017 — highlights

> For the year 2017, OMV expects the average
Brent oil price to be at USD 55/bbl

>» OMV expects to generate a positive free cash
flow after dividends in 2017

>» 2017 CAPEX (incl. capitalized E&A) is expected
to come in at EUR 2 bn

> OMV has set a new cost reduction target of
EUR 250 mn in 2017 compared to 2015

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / COMPANY

Upstream

In the Upstream Business Segment OMV was active as an operator or joint venture partner in 15 countries
at the end of 2016, the majority of which have both exploration and production assets. The hydro-
carbon mix is almost equally split between oil and gas. Approximately 90% of the production volumes
of 311 kboe/d in 2016 came from EU/OECD countries and proved reserves amounted to 1,030 mn boe

at the end of the year. In 2016, OMV took si

ificant actions to reshape the portfolio in line with the

focus on low-cost production regions. OMV signed the Basic Agreement to join the Achimov IV/V
development project in Russia, completed the divestment of OMV (U.K.) Limited and ceased activities

in Namibia and Gabon.

Health, Safety, Security and
Environment (HSSE)

HSSE remains the top priority in Upstream. Our
joint efforts have kept the LTIR at a low level of
0.33 (2015: 0.29). However, regrettably, Upstream
had two fatalities during the year. Both incidents,
as well as all incidents with high consequence
potential, have been investigated thoroughly by
the senior management. Root causes were deter-
mined, and concrete measures have been taken to
prevent any recurrence. In 2016, we directed our
attention to a better understanding and improving
of our safety culture and bringing HSSE closer to
the hearts and minds of our own employees and
key contractors. Moreover, we focused on quality
and effectiveness of management walk-arounds
and the conclusion of the resulting measures. We
also assessed process safety, road transportation
safety and handling of hazardous substances.

Financial performance

The average Brent oil price decreased from

USD 52/bbl to USD 44/bbI. The Group’s average
realized crude price decreased from USD 49/bbl to
USD 40/bbl. The average realized gas price de-
creased from USD 5.5/1,000 cf to USD 4.5/1,000 cf.

Ata glance

Realized prices were impacted by a negative hedg-
ing result of EUR (6) mn in 2016, while in 2015
hedging positively supported with EUR 74 mn.

Total OMV daily production of oil, NGL and gas
increased by 3% to 311 kboe/d. Production in
Norway increased by 23 kboe/d. Norway's higher
contribution offset the decline in production in
Romania, Austria and Pakistan. Norway benefited
from additional wells that came on stream at the
Gullfaks field and less natural decline at the
Gudrun field. The Edvard Grieg field was ramping
up throughout 2016. Total sales volumes increased
by 4%, pushed by higher volumes in Norway.

Production costs excluding royalties (OPEX) de-
creased by 12% to USD 11.59/boe as a result of the
successful implementation of the cost reduction
program (resulting in lower services and person-
nel costs) coupled with higher production. Main
contributors in the cost reduction program were
measures related to renegotiation of contracts,
optimization of overhead costs and field spending
as well as organizational restructuring.

Clean EBIT decreased to EUR 26 mn in 2016 versus
EUR 139 mn in 2015. The impact of significantly
lower oil and gas prices could only partially be
offset by higher sales volumes, lower exploration
expenses and depreciation as well as lower

In 2016, OMV started to optimize the Upstream
portfolio in line with the focus on low-cost produc-
tion regions.

North Sea region

In October 2016, OMV closed the divestment of

a 30% share in the pre-FID project Rosebank to
Suncor. Upon closing, Suncor made an initial pay-
ment of USD 50 mn. Following the co-venturers
approval of the Rosebank project final investment
decision, OMV would receive an additional con-
sideration. The divestments of the UK assets Howe
and Bardolino as well as the Norwegian assets Ivar
Aasen and the pre-FID project Zidane were also
successfully completed during the year.

The sale agreement for the OMV subsidiary OMV
(U.K.) Limited to Siccar Point Energy Limited was
signed in Q4/16 and closed in January 2017. Siccar
Point Energy Limited made a firm closing payment
of USD 873 mn. The transaction documentation
provides for further contingent purchase price ele-
ments depending on the co-venturers’ approval

of the Rosebank project final investment decision.
The divested portfolio includes, among others,

the Jade field (OMV share 5.6%), the Schiehallion

(OMV share 20%), as well as the Cambo, Tornado,
Suilven and Jackdaw projects.

Russia

On December 14, 2016, OMV signed the binding
Basic Agreement with Gazprom regarding the
asset swap. According to the Basic Agreement,
Gazprom will receive a 38.5% stake in OMV
(NORGE) AS. In exchange, OMV will obtain a
24.98% stake in the project for developing blocks
4 and 5 of the Achimov formation in the Urengoy
oil, gas and condensate field. The swap transaction
will add approximately 560 mn boe to OMV’s
reserves representing OMV’'s share of production
until the end of contracts in 2039. Production is
expected to start up in 2019 and to reach a plateau
of more than 80 kboe/day by 2025 (OMV’s share
of production). OMV will continue to fully con-

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / COMPANY

Middle East and Africa

OMV acquired the interests in four Exploration and
Production Sharing Agreements in the Sirte Basin,
Libya, from Occidental to expand its position in
Libya and to strengthen the partnership with the
National Oil Corporation. Consequently, OMV
holds 100% of the second-party shareholding in
blocks C103, NC29/74, C102 and Nafoora Augila.
In 04/16, OMV partially restarted production in
Libya. Production contribution from Libyan assets
is expected to average around 10 kboe/d in 2017,

In 2016, the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC)
and OMV signed a Memorandum of Understand-
ing (MoU) concerning the evaluation of various
fields in the Zagros area in the west of Iran for
potential future development. The MoU also covers
an envisaged cooperation in the area of technology
cooperation, crude and petroleum product swap
business.

Romania

OMV Petrom signed a business transfer agree-
ment of 19 marginal fields to Mazarine Energy in
the course of streamlining the existing portfolio.
Further 292 uneconomic wells have been shut in.

Key projects

Gullfaks (Norway, OMV 19%)

At the Statoil-operated Gullfaks field, with 136 wells
available for production, eight new platform wells
and five new subsea wells were drilled and com-
pleted in 2016. In addition, the Gullfaks Rimfaks-
dalen gas subsea project was successfully finalized
during the year. The construction of a Cat J rig

is ongoing according to plan. The Cat J rigs are
specially designed to perform efficient drilling
operations on subsea development solutions in
addition to conventional surface drilling from
fixed platforms.

Edvard Grieg (Norway, OMV 20%)

The Edvard Grieg offshore field operated by Lundin
achieved its first oil at the end of November 2015
from one oil producer, with a second producer
coming on stream before year-end 2015. In 2016,
two additional production wells and two water
injection wells have been drilled and put into oper-
ation, supporting the increase of production
volumes.

Aasta Hansteen (Norway, OMV 15%) including
Polarled

Aasta Hansteen, the Statoil-operated deepwater
development, achieved the following key mile-
stones in 2016: completion of assembly and erec-
tion of all topside decks, completion of the 2016
marine installation program and structural com-
pleteness for the substructure. The completion and
transportation of the substructure and topside

by the contractor Hyundai Heavy Industries are
scheduled for Q1/17 and 02/17.

Nawara (Tunisia, OMV 50%)

The OMV operated onshore Nawara gas conden-
sate field development project (sanctioned in 2014)
is ongoing with major long-lead-items orders
placed, detailed engineering almost complete and
construction works underway. The first sections

of the pipeline have been laid, the main construc-
tion camps were completed and facilities civil
works are well underway. The project's progress as
of the end of 2016 was greater than 70% and the
first gas production is expected to start mid-2018.

Totea Deep (Romania, OMV 100%)

The Totea Deep development has been the most
important onshore gas discovery in Romania

in recent years. In 2016, OMV Petrom investments
focused on the increase of site capacity and well
workovers. The Totea site’s detail design and up-
grade were completed, and the facilities became
operational in 04/16.

Lebada East (Romania, OMV 100%)

The field redevelopment project upgraded the
existing gas compression system in order to
optimize the value of the field by accommodating
non-associated gas production. The project was
finalized safely, below budget and its first gas was
achieved ahead of schedule in April 2016.

Exploration highlights

In 2016, OMV completed the drilling of nine explo-
ration and appraisal wells in five different countries.
44% of the wells were operated by OMV and the
success rate was 33% (2015: 44%).

The western Black Sea remains a focus area for
exploration and appraisal for OMV. In the Romanian
Black Sea, the second exploration drilling campaign
in the Neptun block was completed. A further three
wells were drilled in other licenses in the onshore
and shallow-water areas of Romania, but without
success. In Bulgaria, a significant deepwater oil
discovery was made in the Polshkov-1 exploration
well, located in the Han Asparuh block.

In the North Sea region, OMV has successfully
completed drilling and testing of the Wisting
Central Il appraisal well. The Wisting Central II
well is the first horizontal appraisal well in

the Barents Sea and sets a new drilling record.
It is the shallowest horizontal offshore well
drilled from a floating drilling facility.

In the United Arab Emirates, further appraisal
drilling in the Shuwaihat field and OMV operated
exploration drilling at XN-003 commenced in
04/16 in the East Abu Dhabi area.

Seismic acquisition activities were carried out in
Norway, Tunisia, Pakistan and New Zealand. OMV
optimized the exploration portfolio throughout
2016, with notable relinquishments and additions
in Norway. In Norway, the PL855 license was
awarded to OMV in the 23rd round. It lies adjacent
to the Wisting field.

OMV ceased activities in Gabon, Namibia and
Madagascar (onshore). Exploration expenditure
decreased considerably by 49% to EUR 307 mn in
2016 versus EUR 607 mn in 2015. Due to refocusing
the exploration strategy and agreed cost-saving
measures, a lower number of wells were drilled,
and fewer seismic surveys were acquired.

68

Reserves development

Proven (1P) reserves as of December 31, 2016,
slightly increased to 1,030 mn boe (thereof OMV
Petrom': 606 mn boe). The 2016 one-year Reserve
Replacement Rate (RRR) was 101% (2015: 44%).
The three-year average RRR decreased to 70% in
2016 (2015: 73%). The RRR was supported by
newly introduced booking of reserves from OMV's
10% shareholding in Pearl Petroleum Company,
expansion of the OMV position in Libya and posi-
tive reserves revisions, mainly in Norway and
Romania.

Proved and probable oil and gas reserves (2P)
amounted to 1,696 mn boe (thereof OMV Petrom!:
879 mn boe). The divestment of a 30% share in
Rosebank could be more than compensated by 2P
reserves additions, mainly from Pearl Petroleum
Company and Libya.

Outlook 2017 — highlights
> Total production: 320 kboe/d
> CAPEX (including capitalized E&A): EUR 1.4 bn

> Exploration and appraisal expenditure:
EUR 300 mn

>» On March 5, 2017, OMV signed an agreement
to acquire a 24.99% share in the Yuzhno
Russkoye natural gas field located in Western
Siberia from Uniper SE. The purchase
price amounts to USD 1,850 mn. The trans-
action is anticipated to close by the end
of 2017 and will be retroactively effective
as of January 1, 2017

Downstream

The Downstream Business Segment consists of Downstream Oil, including petrochemicals and
Downstream Gas. Thanks to the strong performance in our sales channels, the resulting continued

good utilization rates of our refineries, a high crude fle:

ity, our integrated retail network and

very good Borealis performance, Downstream Oil achieved a strong operating result of EUR 940 mn
in 2016. In Downstream Gas, the financial performance of the supply, marketing and trading business
improved due to the positive restructuring effects, while gas logistics performance benefited from
cost reductions. The operating result in Downstream Gas amounted to EUR 182 mn.

Health, Safety, Security and
Environment (HSSE)

In line with OMV's HSSE Vision “ZERO harm - NO
losses,” HSSE is the top priority for Downstream.
By enforcing the highest standards in contractor
management and transportation safety, the number
of road accidents was significantly reduced com-
pared to 2015. However, the Lost-Time Injury Rate
(LTIR) increased from 0.27 in 2015 to 0.48 in 2016.
While this level is still competitive compared to
international benchmarks, it is the clear priority to
further increase our efforts.

Financial performance

Downstream recorded a high clean CCS EBIT of
EUR 1,122 mn. This result, however, was 5% lower
compared to the previous year, given a decreased
contribution from Downstream Oil. At EUR 940 mn,
Downstream Oil clean CCS EBIT was below the
EUR 1,209 mn achieved in 2015 due to the lower
refining result. The OMV indicator refining mar-
gin decreased from USD 7.2/bbI to USD 4.7/bbl,
mainly due to lower naphtha and middle distillates
spreads. This trend was partly compensated by
lower crude prices. The refining utilization rate
stood at 89% versus 93% in 2015, reflecting the

At a glance

planned turnarounds of approximately one month
at Schwechat and Petrobrazi in the second quarter
2016. The clean petrochemicals EBIT was down 9%
at EUR 238 mn, reflecting lower propylene margins.
The retail business showed a very strong perfor-
mance. At EUR 116 mn, OMV Petrol Ofisi made a
significantly higher contribution to earnings than
in the previous year (2015: EUR 84 mn).

At EUR 182 mn, Downstream Gas clean EBIT
turned significantly positive, largely a result of
restructuring efforts and the sound contribution
from the gas logistics business. Natural gas sales
volumes remained flat at 109 TWh in 2016. The
contribution of the gas transportation business in
Austria was stable at EUR 126 mn. The power
business remained challenging, with net electrical
output decreasing to 5.2TWh compared to 5.4TWh
in 2015.

Special items of EUR (482) mn were recorded
mainly related to the impairment of OMV Petrol
Ofisi of EUR (334) mn, following the reclassification
of the asset as an asset held for sale, as well as
the impairment of the Samsun power plant of
EUR (101) mn and the Etzel gas storage facility of
EUR (73) mn. Increased crude prices over the year
contributed to positive CCS effects of EUR 55 mn.
Reported EBIT amounted to EUR 695 mn.

CAPEX (capital expenditure) in Downstream
amounted to EUR 513 mn (2015: EUR 608 mn), of
which EUR 463 mn were in Downstream Oil (2015:
EUR 546 mn). Downstream Oil investments related
primarily to the turnaround of the refineries, OMV
Petrol Ofisi contract renewals and retail main-
tenance. OMV invested EUR 49 mn in Downstream
Gas (2015: EUR 62 mn).

Downstream Oil

Refining including product supply & sales

Constantly changing market developments and
refining overcapacities in Europe put pressure on
the refining margins leading to lower levels than
in 2015. However, a solid operating result was
achieved due to the strong sales performance. The
demand for our products has been sustainable.
This again resulted in a high utilization rate of our
refineries, which came in at 89% in 2016 (2015:
93%) despite turnaround activities in our Schwechat
and Petrobrazi refinery sites.

In the petrochemical business, sales volumes were
at the level of 2015 and margins, although still
healthy, below the previous year. The reason for
this were weaker propylene margins that could
only be partially compensated by higher ethylene
margins. On the supply side, a broadened and
more flexible range of highly economic crudes
resulted in higher profitability. OMV was among
the first European integrated oil companies to
lift Iranian oil after the end of the sanctions. OMV
runs the three refinery sites as one integrated
refinery system. This system allows us to fully
capitalize on the flexibilities in shifting output to-
wards high-value products, leveraging economies
of scale and aligning investments strategically.

Retail

The Retail business continued its strong perfor-
mance in 2016 and proved to be a stable outlet for
refinery products. Total sales volume increased

by 1% compared to 2015, despite the negative im-
pact from the significantly optimized network of
OMV Petrol Ofisi. At the same time, the average
throughput could be increased again by 2%, result-
ing in a further efficiency gain. At the end of the
year, the network included 3,777 filling stations.
Through the acquisition of FE-Trading GmbH with
a total of 72 filling stations in Austria and Slovenia,
OMV extended its network to 212 unmanned filling
stations. With that, we further strengthened our
offer to our customers. The OMV brand is positioned
as a premium brand with VIVA representing a
strong shop, gastronomy and service offer. The
Avanti/FE brand stands for discount, and the Petrom
and Petrol Ofisi brands stand for value for money.
This strategy continued to deliver good results.
OMV’s premium brand MaxxMotion demonstrated
a high performance, reflecting the premium quality
focus, on the one hand, and increased afford-
ability due to lower product prices on the other
hand. Non-oil business, such as the VIVA conve-
nience stores and Car Wash, continued its sustain-
able development with an increased contribution
compared to 2015. A focus on the highest-quality
products and services in the premium filling station
network remains one of the key differentiators.
The retail sales volumes of OMV Petrol Ofisi de-
creased by 5% in line with the network optimization;
however, the overall profitability of the company
was improved compared to 2015.

Borealis

Borealis benefited from a strong market environ-
ment especially in the polyolefins business and
delivered a record net profit contribution to OMV
in 2016 of EUR 399 mn (2015: EUR 356 mn). The
much improved result over 2015 was the result of
higher polyolefins margins as well as a solid contri-
bution from the base chemicals business.

Overall, this could compensate for the weaker fertil-
izer business that suffered from lower demand and
prices. In addition, Borealis’s joint venture with the
Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Borouge, bene-
fited from increased production capacities and
again delivered an excellent result.


--- Page 22 ---

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / COMPANY

Borealis will continue to invest in the future and
announced a feasibility study for a new world-scale
Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) plant in Kallo,
Belgium. Polyolefin recycling is regarded as a
strategic part of the business, and hence Borealis
acquired the German recycler mtm plastics in
2016, a technology leader in the recycling of mixed
post-consumer plastic waste.

Downstream Gas

Although the market environment remained
challenging, the restructuring measures and some
one-off effects had a very positive impact on the
2016 financial performance.

Supply, marketing and trading

Total gas sales volumes to third parties remained
stable compared to 2015, reaching 109 TWh. The
margin environment remained weak, but financial
performance could be significantly improved

due to restructuring effects. On May 20, 2016, OMV
acquired the remaining shares in EconGas. OMV
now holds a 100% interest in OMV Gas Marketing &
Trading (former EconGas). The integration of the
trading organization of OMV Trading into OMV Gas
Marketing &Trading is on track. Expansion of
OMV's sales activities in Germany towards the
target of a 10% market share by 2025 are pro-
gressing as planned.

In Romania, OMV Petrom Gas maintained a leading
position in the gas market despite a challenging
environment. This was primarily triggered by a fluc-
tuating demand and increased competition, in-
cluding imported gas. Natural gas sales volumes
to third parties were relatively stable at 44TWh
(2015: 45 TWh). The profit contribution increased
compared to the previous year.

The gas sales business in Turkey showed signifi-
cantly higher gas margins. Moreover, natural gas
sales volumes to third parties increased to

8.9 TWh in 2016 compared to 7.9TWh in 2015.

The power business continued to be affected by
the difficult economic environment for gas-fired
power plants. Net electrical output stood at

5.2 TWh in 2016, a reduction of 4% compared to
2015. Performance in 2016 was impacted by limited
availability of the Samsun power plant due to a
condenser failure in the second quarter 2016 and
of the Brazi power plant due to a transformer failure
in the fourth quarter 2016.

Gas logistics

The gas transportation business achieved a slightly
better result compared to 2015, primarily generated
by lower costs but burdened by reduced sales of
short-term transportation contracts. The announced
sale in 2015 of a minority stake (49%) of Gas
Connect Austria (GCA) was successfully completed
by the end of 2016. A cash consideration of

EUR 601 mn paid by a consortium of Allianz Capital
Partners and SNAM S.p.A. reflects the high value
of OMV’s transportation business. In the gas
storage business, the overall market environment
in 2016 remained challenging due to low summer/
winter spreads. The pressure on OMV's results
could almost be compensated by strict cost man-
agement and higher storage capacities sold. In its
tenth year, the Central European Gas Hub Virtual
Trading Point (CEGH-VTP) traded 533 TWh of
natural gas, an increase of 11.4% compared to 2015.
To improve the international gas exchange busi-
ness, the CEGH went into a new partnership with
Powernext.

With regard to the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline
joint venture, OMV, ENGIE, Gazprom, Shell, Uniper
and Wintershall, jointly withdrew their merger
control notifications from the Polish competition
authority followed by the termination of the
respective shareholders’ agreement. This had no
consequence on the continuation of the Nord
Stream 2 project. OMV remains interested in sup-
porting this project.

Outlook 2017 — highlights

> Refining capacity utilization in 2017 is expected
to be above 90%

> On March 3, 2017, OMV has agreed to sell OMV
Petrol Ofisi to VIP Turkey Enerji AS for an overall
transaction value of EUR 1.368 bn. The closing
is expected in Q3/17 at the latest

> Natural gas sales volumes are expected to be
flat in 2017 compared to 2016

Directors’ Report

Business Environment

At 3.1%, global economic growth was down slightly
year on year in 2016. Lower energy and raw
material prices coupled with restrictions on trade
pushed the growth in world trade down to only
1.9%. The pace of growth in emerging and develop-
ing economies remained unchanged at 4.1%,
while economic output in industrialized countries
dropped by 0.5 percentage points to 1.6%. For the
first time since 2008, eurozone growth, at 1.7%,
outpaced that of the United States, which stood at
1.6%. While inflation remained low at 0.3%, the
European Central Bank continued its expansive
monetary policy and lowered base rates to 0%.

The growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
in the EU-28 countries was 1.8%, while unemploy-
ment fell to 10%. Contrary to expectations, the
result of the Brexit referendum had not had any
negative economic effects as of the end of 2016.
In Germany, GDP went up by 1.9% on the back of
stable domestic demand and investment, although
the increase in foreign trade was not as strong.
Economic output in Austria grew by 1.5%. As in
Germany, consumption and investment — both of
which accelerated as a result of the latest tax
reform — made the most significant contribution
to growth. Merchandise exports grew slowly, but
there was an upturn in demand for exports of
services (especially tourism). Romania was the
fastest-growing economy in the EU in 2016, post-

Crude price (Brent) - monthly average

ing an increase in GDP of 4.8%. The rise in private
and public consumption was above average, but
the balance of payments deficit weighed on higher
growth. Turkey’s economy continued its robust
expansion in the first half of 2016, spurred by
private consumption and public investment. How-
ever, security issues and the resulting decline in
tourism had a significant impact on the economy
in the second half of the year. GDP growth fell to
2.7%, down from 6.1% in 2015.

Global oil demand hit a new record of 96.5 mn bbl/d
(up 1.6%) in 2016, with non-OECD (Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development)
countries, mostly countries with low per capita
income, accounting for 80% of the increase

(up 1.2 mn bbl/d or 2.5%). There was only a modest
rise in OECD demand (of 0.3 mn bbi/d or 0.4%),
which was attributable exclusively to European
OECD countries. Global oil production was

0.3 mn bbl/d higher than in 2015, at 96.9 mn bbl/d,
exceeding demand by 0.4 mn bbi/d. Production of
crude oil and output of Natural Gas Liquids (NGL)
of OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries) member countries went up by 3.2% or
1.1 mn bbl/d, to 39.3 mn bbl/d. This increase was
mainly attributable to Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.

Non-OPEC countries produced 0.9 mn bbl/d less
than in 2015. About half of this decrease was
accounted for by the United States, where output
dropped by 3.6%.

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Due to oversupply, the Brent oil price reached a low
for 2016 of USD 26/bbl in January but recovered
during the remainder of the year. In late November
2016, OPEC members agreed to cut production by
1.2 mn bbl in the first half of 2017, Russia and other
producers supported this effort to stabilize the
market by announcing further decreases in pro-
duction. Prices subsequently jumped by around
20%, passing the USD 50/bbI mark. The average
price of Brent crude was 17% lower year on year
in 2016 at USD 43.73/bbI.

The exchange rate of the euro to the dollar remained
virtually unchanged at USD 1.11. The euro prices

of petroleum products on the Rotterdam market
declined by 17-20%.

Financial Review of the Year

Group financials

Group financials

Austrian natural gas demand increased by 4.7%

in 2016 to 8.3 bem or 92.8TWh, and electricity gen-
eration at gas-fired power stations rose by 19%.
Domestic natural gas production was 6% lower, at
12.6TWh, while net imports increased by 25% to
more than 80 TWh. At year-end, there was a total
of 55TWh of gas in storage, for a full percentage
rate of 57%.

Petroleum product sales volumes in the markets
served by OMV (Central and Southeastern Europe
and Turkey) climbed to more than 180 mn t in 2016.
Sales in Austria totaled around 11.1 mnt, a gain

of 3%, of which 80% was attributable to stronger
demand for diesel. In Germany, total sales went up
by 2%, driven mainly by diesel (up 5%) and aviation
fuel (up 6%). Increased sales in Romania (up 4%)
and Turkey (up 5%) can also be traced back to a
lively demand for transportation fuel.

In 2016, the market environment was substantially
worse than in 2015, with Brent oil prices down

by 17%, Central European Gas Hub (CEGH) prices
down by 28%, and the OMV indicator refining
margin down by 34%. In addition, a total of

EUR (1.8) bn of impairments booked in 2016 af-
fected the Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
(EBIT) of EUR (457) mn, partly compensated by a
strong Downstream result, higher Upstream sales
volumes, lower depreciation and the Group-wide
cost savings.

The significant improvement against last year’s
negative result of EUR (2,006) mn was mainly
related to the substantial impairments booked in
2015 across the entire Upstream portfolio as a
result of the drop in oil and gas prices. In 2016, the
main impairments were related to the divestments
of a 30% stake in Rosebank field and of OMV (U.K.)
Limited, both of which are in Upstream. In Down-
stream, Samsun power plant and Etzel gas storage
were impaired as well as OMV Petrol Ofisi follow-
ing the reclassification to “held for sale.”

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / DIRECTORS’ REPORT

The net financial result of EUR 227 mn was signifi-
cantly above 2015 (EUR 97 mn), spurred by a
higher result contribution coming from associated
companies, the optimization of OMV Group's
financing structure and a positive foreign exchange
result. The Group’s current income tax expenses
amounted to EUR (130) mn and deferred tax in-
come to EUR 178 mn. The effective tax rate was at
21% (2015: 34%). Net income attributable to stock-
holders of the parent was EUR (403) mn, above the
2015 figure of EUR (1,100) mn. Non-controlling
and hybrid interests stood at EUR 221 mn (2015:
EUR (155) mn). The improved performance is

also reflected in the Return On Average Capital
Employed (ROACE), which increased from (6)% in
2015 to 0% in 2016. For definitions of this ratio,
please refer to the glossary of abbreviations and
definitions, which is an integral part of the
Directors’ Report.

The year 2016 continued to be a challenging year
for the Upstream Business Segment. This Business
Segment is active as operator or as joint venture
partner in 15 countries, in the majority of which
OMV has both exploration and production assets.
OMV Upstream’s geographical footprint in 2016
covers Romania and Black Sea, Austria, North Sea,
Australasia, Middle East and Africa. The hydro-
carbon mix is relatively equally split between oil
and gas. Proved oil and gas reserves (1P) slightly
increased to 1,030 mn boe (2015: 1,028 mn boe).
More than two-thirds of the Upstream production
volume of 311 kboe/d (2015: 303 kboe/d) is pro-
duced in the mature core countries Austria and
Romania. These are complemented by the balanced
international portfolio in which the North Sea
region has developed into a core area with a pro-
duction of approximately 70 kboe/d in 2016.

The key projects in OMV’s Upstream exploration
and development portfolio are Neptun Deep in
Romania; Edvard Grieg, Aasta Hansteen, Gullfaks
and Wisting in Norway; Nawara in Tunisia; and
Shuwaihat and East Abu Dhabi in the United Arab
Emirates, while field redevelopment Lebada Est in
Romania was completed and put in production in
2016.

In the Downstream Business Segment, Downstream
Oil operates along the entire oil value chain: It
processes equity and third-party crude in its three
refineries and markets refined products to com-
mercial customers and through its retail network
of 3,777 filling stations, with total refined product
sales of 30.74 mn t. The refineries in Schwechat
(Austria) and Burghausen (Germany) operate pet-
rochemical complexes, having the petrochemical
company Borealis as a key customer. OMV holds
a 36% stake in Borealis.

Downstream Gas markets OMV's European equity
gas production as well as third-party gas to end-use
customers and on Europe's main gas hubs. It oper-
ates a ~900 km high-pressure natural gas pipeline
network in Austria together with 30 TWh of storage
capacity and holds a 65% stake in the Central
European Gas Hub, an important gas trading hub
in Central and Eastern Europe. Furthermore, OMV
operates two gas-fired power plants in Romania
and Turkey, generating a net electrical output of
5.18 TWh in 2016.

Upstream EBIT was negative at EUR (1,059) mn,
being negatively impacted by the impairments
booked in 2016 and the low oil price environment.
Positive developments in 2016 came from lower
depreciation resulting from a lower asset base fol-
lowing the significant impairments in 2015 and
from reduced production costs. The main impair
ments in 2016 were related to the divestments of a
30% stake in Rosebank of EUR (543) mn and of
OMV (U.K.) Limited of EUR (493) mn, significantly
below the 2015 amount of EUR (2,449) mn. Pro-
duction costs excluding royalties (OPEX) decreased
by 12% to USD 11.59/boe as a result of the success-
ful implementation of the cost reduction program
that resulted in lower services and personnel
costs, coupled with higher production. Daily pro-
duction of oil, NGL and gas increased in 2016 by
3% to 311 kboe/d mainly due to higher volumes in
Norway, partly offset by the natural decline of oil
and gas production in Romania. Total sales volumes
increased by 4%, while the average realized prices
for crude as well as for gas decreased by 19%.
While hedging positively supported the result
with EUR 74 mn in 2015, realized prices in 2016
were impacted by a negative hedging result of
EUR (6) mn.

Downstream recorded a strong EBIT of EUR 695 mn,
which was significantly above the EUR 334 mn

in 2015 mainly due to lower impairments and pro-
visions. Downstream Oil EBIT of EUR 744 mn
represents a decrease of 16% compared to

EUR 890 mn in 2015 driven by a EUR (334) mn
impairment booked for OMV Petrol Ofisi disposal
group following reclassification to “held for sale,”
partly offset by higher sales volumes and lower
crude prices. The OMV indicator refining margin

decreased from USD 7.2/bb! to USD 4.7/bbl, mainly
due to lower naphtha and middle distillates
spreads. This trend was partly compensated for by
lower crude prices. In 2016, the refining utilization
rate stood at 89% versus 93% in 2015. The reduc-
tion was the result of the planned turnarounds

of approximately one month in Schwechat and
Petrobrazi. Lower propylene margins led to a petro-
chemical EBIT decrease of 9% to EUR 238 mn.
Meanwhile, the retail business showed very strong
performance. At EUR (148) mn, OMV Petrol Ofisi
made a significantly lower contribution to earnings
than in the previous year (EUR (11) mn in 2015).

Downstream Gas EBIT of EUR (49) mn improved
significantly against the 2015 EBIT of EUR (555) mn.
This was mainly spurred by lower impairments
and provisions booked in 2016 compared to the
prior year, together with restructuring efforts and
the stable contribution from the gas logistics busi-
ness. Main impairments in 2016 were related to the
Samsun power plant with EUR (101) mn and the
Etzel gas storage facility with EUR (73) mn. Natural
gas sales volumes remained flat at 109TWh in
2016. The contribution of the gas transportation
business in Austria was also stable at EUR 126 mn
while the power business remained challenging,
with net electrical output decreasing to 5.2TWh
compared to 5.4TWh in 2015.

EBIT in the Corporate and Other segment
decreased by 16% to EUR (56) mn in 2016.

OMV is an integrated, international oil and gas
company. As the crude oil produced by Upstream
is passed on to Downstream Oil and either pro-
cessed at Group refineries or — in a large part —
marketed via OMV Supply &Trading Limited, the
Downstream Oil business represents the largest
share of the Group’s consolidated sales. The vola-
tility in the main factors affecting profitability —
crude oil and gas prices and USD exchange rates —
may cause considerable swings in sales revenues
and cost of sales. Therefore, their impact on earn-
ings is difficult to predict.

Although sales volumes increased compared to
2015, due to the lower price environment consoli-
dated sales revenues decreased by 15% to

EUR 19,260 mn. Sales of the Upstream Business
Segment decreased by 16% to EUR 3,285 mn.
After the elimination of intra-Group transactions of
EUR 2,272 mn, the contribution of Upstream to
consolidated sales revenues was EUR 1,013 mn or
about 5% of the Group's total sales revenues
(2015: EUR 1,017 mn or 5%). Consolidated sales in
Downstream Oil amounted to EUR 14,603 mn or
76% of total sales (2015: EUR 17,290 mn or 77%).
Downstream Gas sales decreased to EUR 3,779 mn
(2015: EUR 4,382 mn). After elimination of intra-
segmental sales to refineries, the contribution of
Downstream Gas in 2016 was 19% of total sales or
EUR 3,640 mn (2015: EUR 4,215 mn or 19%).

78

Sales to external customers are split up by geo-
graphical areas on the basis of where the delivery
of goods or services is effective. Austria retained
its position as the Group’s most important geo-
graphical market with sales of EUR 4,884 mn or
25% of the Group’s total (2015: EUR 5,787 mn or
26%). Sales revenues in Germany decreased from
EUR 3,595 mn in 2015 to EUR 2,777 mn in 2016,
representing a revenue contribution of 14% (2015:
16%). In Romania, the sales revenues amounted to
EUR 3,006 mn or 16% of total sales revenues (2015:
EUR 3,307 mn or 15%). Sales revenues in Turkey
decreased to EUR 4,817 mn or 25% of OMV Group's
total sales in 2016 (2015: EUR 5,638 mn or 25%).
Sales in the rest of Central and Eastern Europe
(CEE) were EUR 2,477 mn or 13% of Group sales
revenues (2015: EUR 2,669 mn or 12%). The rest of
Europe accounted for EUR 931 mn or 5% (2015:
EUR 914 mn or 4%). Sales revenues in the rest of
the world decreased to EUR 369 mn, representing
2% of total sales revenues (2015: EUR 616 mn

or 3%).

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Direct selling expenses, mainly consisting of third-
party freight-out expenses, slightly increased to
EUR (355) mn (2015: EUR (327) mn) on account of
higher volumes sold in Upstream. Cost of sales,
which includes variable and fixed production costs
as well as costs of goods and materials employed,
decreased by 25% to EUR (16,559) mn, reflecting
the lower price environment and fewer impair-
ments compared to 2015. Other operating income
increased to EUR 644 mn (2015: EUR 392 mn) in
2016, mainly due to the write-up of an asset in the
Middle East and Africa region following reclassi-
fication to “held for sale” and to a gain from the
divestment of the Aliaga terminal in Turkey. Sell-
ing and administrative expenses amounted to
EUR (1,347) mn (2015: EUR (1,277) mn). Explora-
tion expenses amounting to EUR (808) mn in-
creased by 14% mainly due to the impairment of
Rosebank, which was partly compensated by
reduced exploration activities in 2016. Research
and development (R&D) expenses remained
stable at EUR (28) mn (2015: EUR (28) mn). Other
operating expenses of EUR (1,264) mn were
significantly above 2015, mainly as a result of im-
pairments following reclassification to “held for
sale” of OMV Petrol Ofisi and OMV (U.K.) Limited
disposal groups.

The net financial result improved to EUR 227 mn
(2015: EUR 97 mn), spurred mainly by higher
income from equity-accounted investments and an
improved net interest result. Income from equity-
accounted investments in total amounted to

EUR 425 mn (2015: EUR 345 mn) and reflected
mainly the 36% share of the result from the
Borealis group amounting to EUR 399 mn (2015:
EUR 356 mn). Dividend income amounted to

EUR 41 mn (2015: EUR 37 mn). The net interest
result showed an expense balance of EUR (195) mn
(2015: EUR (215) mn). The positive effect compared
to 2015 was mainly related to lower interest
expenses due to the improved financing structure.

Taxes on income were EUR 47 mn (2015:

EUR 654 mn). Current income tax expenses
amounted to EUR (130) mn (2015: EUR (133) mn),
and deferred tax income amounted to EUR 178 mn
(2015: EUR 787 mn). The Group's effective tax rate
decreased to 21% (2015: 34%). For further details
on taxes on income, please refer to Note 11 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

CAPEX decreased to EUR 1,878 mn (2015:

EUR 2,769 mn) as a result of the strict cost reduc-
tion program and portfolio reshaping. Upstream
invested EUR 1,356 mn (2015: EUR 2,140 mn)
mainly in field developments in Norway and in
field redevelopments, drilling and work-over activi-
ties in Romania. Downstream CAPEX amounted
to EUR 513 mn (2015: EUR 608 mn), thereof

EUR 463 mn in Downstream Oil (2015: EUR 546
mn) and EUR 49 mn in Downstream Gas (2015:
EUR 62 mn). The main investments made were
related to maintenance and compliance activities
in the refineries and to the implementation of the
new discount concept in retail. CAPEX in the
Corporate and Other segment was EUR 10 mn
(2015: EUR 21 mn).

80

The reconciliation of total capital expenditure to
additions according to the statement of non-current
assets (intangible and tangible) mainly relates to
additions, which by definition are not considered
to be capital expenditure, as well as investments in
financial assets. The difference between the addi-
tions shown in the statement of non-current assets
and the investments reported in the cash flow
statement partly arise from additions to intangible
and tangible assets that did not affect investing
cash flows during the period (including accrued
liabilities arising from investments, new finance
leases, decommissioning and capitalized borrow-
ing costs). In addition, cash outflows due to invest-
ments in financial assets are included in the overall
investments shown in the cash flow statement.

Total assets decreased by EUR 552 mn to

EUR 32,112 mn. The decrease in non-current assets
amounting to EUR 3,012 mn was mainly related
to the ongoing divestment activities and the
related reclassification to the balance sheet posi-
tion “assets held for sale,” partly offset by invest-
ments made. Equity-accounted investments
increased by EUR 298 mn. Changes of equity-
accounted investments included to a large extent
the contribution of Borealis as well as the propor-
tional results from other equity-accounted invest-
ments, currency translation of foreign operations
and other changes including dividends received
amounting to EUR 177 mn. Other non-current
assets, which primarily comprise non-current
receivables, loans and securities, increased by
EUR 90 mn to EUR 1,017 mn, with the change
being mainly related to the contingent consider-

ation to be received for the divestment of a 30%
stake in Rosebank. Deferred tax assets decreased
to EUR 839 mn (2015: EUR 850 mn). Current assets
decreased by EUR 850 mn and amounted to

EUR 7,666 mn as of December 31, 2016. The main
reason was a decrease of EUR 945 mn in the
derivatives position. Inventories decreased by
EUR 210 mn and trade receivables by EUR 108 mn
primarily due to reclassifications to assets held
for sale, partly compensated by increases due

to the higher commodity prices. The overall cash
position increased to EUR 2,314 mn, which in-
cludes EUR 245 mn cash related to disposal groups
that is being reported within assets held for sale.
Assets held for sale increased by EUR 3,311 mn
mainly due to the reclassification of OMV Petrol
Ofisi and OMV (U.K.) Limited disposal groups.

81

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Equity (including non-controlling interest) de-
creased by 3% in comparison to 2015, while the
equity ratio decreased to 43% (2015: 44%).
Pensions and similar obligations increased by
EUR 12 mn. Non-current decommissioning and
restoration obligations decreased by EUR 22 mn,
as the reassessment effects of provisions were
more than compensated by the reclassification
to liabilities associated with assets held for sale
in connection with the ongoing divestment pro-
cesses.

Current and non-current bonds and other inter-
est-bearing debts decreased by EUR 90 mn,
mainly related to the repayment of an international
corporate bond and other long-term debt as well
as short-term money market lines, partly compen-
sated by new drawings of long-term loans.

Trade payables increased by EUR 352 mn, primarily
due to higher oil prices at year-end 2016, compen-
sated by reclassifications to liabilities associated
with assets held for sale. Current and non-current
other provisions and other liabilities decreased
by EUR 1,399 mn, of which EUR 877 mn related to
a lower balance of derivatives. Deferred tax liabili-
ties decreased to EUR 122 mn (2015: EUR 229 mn).
Liabilities associated with assets held for sale
increased by EUR 1,075 mn mainly due to the
reclassification of OMV Petrol Ofisi and OMV
(U.K.) Limited disposal groups.

Gearing ratio

As of December 31, 2016, short-and long-term
borrowings, bonds and finance leases
amounted to EUR 5,283 mn (December 31, 2015:
EUR 5,386 mn), thereof EUR 8 mn are disclosed
as liabilities associated with assets held for sale,
being part of OMV Petrol Ofisi disposal group. The
overall cash position increased to EUR 2,314 mn
(December 31, 2015: EUR 1,348 mn), thereof
EUR 245 mn are disclosed as assets held for sale
being part of OMV Petrol Ofisi and OMV (U.K.)
Limited disposal groups. Net debt decreased to
EUR 2,969 mn compared to EUR 4,038 mn at the
end of 2015. On December 31, 2016, the gearing
ratio, defined as net debt divided by equity, stood
at 21% (December 31, 2015: 28%).

82

Cash flow

The Group's cash flow statement is prepared using
the indirect method, whereby adjustments are
made for changes in the group of consolidated
companies, foreign exchange differences and other
non-cash transactions.

The inflow of funds from net income, adjusted for
non-cash items such as depreciation, net change in
long-term provisions, non-cash income from in-
vestments and other positions, was EUR 3,026 mn
(2015: EUR 3,234 mn), below last year as a result of
a lower price environment and compensated by
positive effects from the cost reduction program.
During 2016, dividends received from equity-
accounted investments and other companies
amounted to EUR 217 mn (2015: EUR 84 mn).
Cash flow from operating activities increased
slightly by EUR 44 mn or 2% from EUR 2,834 mn

in 2015 to EUR 2,878 mn in 2016. There was a net
cash outflow from net working capital components
of EUR 148 mn (2015: EUR 400 mn), which was
mainly attributable to changes in commodity prices
as well as to higher trade receivables related to the
lifting schedule in the Upstream segment.

Cash outflows for investments in non-current
assets and acquisitions of subsidiaries and
businesses net of cash acquired of EUR 2,141 mn
(2015: EUR 3,066 mn) were partly offset by pro-
ceeds from the sale of non-current assets and
businesses amounting to EUR 344 mn (2015:

EUR 193 mn). In 2016, acquisitions of subsidiaries
and businesses net of cash acquired included the
acquisition of FE-Trading GmbH and FE-Trading
trgovina d.o.0. of EUR 57 mn, reflecting the cash
consideration of EUR 26 mn paid to the seller and
the redemption of trade and other financial liabili-
ties in the amount of EUR 31 mn. The proceeds
from the sale of non-current assets and businesses
mainly included cash inflows from the divestment
of the Aliaga terminal in Turkey and of the 30%
stake in Rosebank. Net cash outflow from invest-
ment activities totaled EUR 1,797 mn (2015:

EUR 2,874 mn). The lower cash outflow in 2016
reflected the measures taken to reduce invest-
ments.



--- Page 34 ---

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Cash outflows from the net decrease of short- and
long-term borrowings amounted to EUR (98) mn
(2015: EUR (190) mn). In 2016, a EUR 250 mn bond
was repaid together with other long-term debt,
which was partially compensated by new long-term
borrowings, of which EUR 147 mn were related
to long-term financing provided by the minority
shareholders of GAS CONNECT AUSTRIA GmbH.
In 2015, there were repayments of the US private
placement bond and other long-term debt and
finance leases as well as short-term money market
lines, partially offset by new drawings of long-
term loans.

In 2016, OMV acquired the remaining non-con-
trolling stake in OMV Gas Marketing & Trading
GmbH for EUR 3 and received a EUR 36 mn contri-
bution by former minority shareholders of OMV
Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH. Also, there was a
significant cash inflow resulting from the sale of

a 49% minority stake in GAS CONNECT AUSTRIA
GmbH in the amount of EUR 454 mn.

In 2015, the Group acquired the remaining non-
controlling stake of 1.2% in OMV Petrol Ofisi A.S.
Cash outflows for dividend payments amounted
to EUR 466 mn (2015: EUR 530 mn), of which
EUR 326 mn (2015: EUR 408 mn) were paid to OMV
shareholders, EUR 2 mn (2015: EUR 71 mn) to
shareholders of non-controlling interests and
EUR 137 mn (2015: EUR 51 mn) to hybrid capital
owners. During 2015, there was a significant net
cash inflow of funds following the issuance of the
new hybrid notes in the amount of EUR 1,490 mn.
Net cash outflow from financing activities
amounted to EUR 74 mn (2015: net cash inflow
EUR 758 mn).

Free cash flow showed an inflow of funds of

EUR 1,081 mn (2015: outflow of EUR 39 mn). Free
cash flow after dividends resulted in a cash inflow
of EUR 615 mn (2015: outflow of EUR 569 mn),
mainly due to lower investments. Free cash flow
after dividends including changes from non-con-
trolling interests, which reflects mainly the cash
inflow from the divestment of a 49% minority stake
in GAS CONNECT AUSTRIA GmbH, amounted to
EUR 1,105 mn in 2016.

Outlook 2017

Market environment

For the year 2017, OMV expects the average Brent
oil price to be at USD 55/bbI. The gas market
environment in Europe continues to be character-
ized by oversupply. However, average gas prices
on European spot markets are expected to show
an increase in 2017.

Group

OMV expects to generate a positive free cash
flow after dividends in 2017. Capital expenditure
(CAPEX) including capitalized exploration and
appraisal activities for 2017 is expected to come
in at EUR 2 bn. The cost reduction program imple-
mented in 2016 is being continued in 2017 with

a target of reducing costs by EUR 250 mn in 2017
compared to 2015. The proposed dividend is

EUR 1.20 per share for the 2016 financial year.

Upstream

OMV expects the total production to be 320 kboe/d
in 2017, which includes the contribution from Pearl
Petroleum Company of close to 8 kboe/d. Produc-
tion in Libya has partially restarted and is expected
to contribute on average 10 kbbl/d in 2017, CAPEX
(including capitalized E&A) is expected to come in
at EUR 1.4 bn in 2017. Exploration and appraisal
expenditure is expected to amount to EUR 300 mn.

On March 5, 2017, OMV signed an agreement to
acquire a 24.99% share in the Yuzhno Russkoye
natural gas field located in western Siberia from
Uniper SE. The purchase price amounts to

USD 1,850 mn. This amount is not included in the
EUR 2 bn CAPEX guidance for 2017. The transaction
is anticipated to close by the end of 2017 and will
be retroactively effective as of January 1, 2017.

Downstream

Refining margins are projected to trend downwards
due to crude price recovery and persisting over-
capacity in the market. The capacity utilization in
2017 is expected to be above 90%. A planned full
site turnaround at the Schwechat refinery is
scheduled in April for approximately one month.
Petrochemical margins are estimated to slightly
decrease in 2017 versus 2016 following the oil
price recovery. Commercial and retail margins
are projected to be below the levels of 2016.

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / DIRECTORS’ REPORT

On March 3, 2017, OMV agreed to sell OMV Petrol
Ofisi to VIP Turkey Enerji AS, a subsidiary of Vitol
Investment Partnership Ltd., for an overall trans-
action value of EUR 1,368 mn. The closing is
expected in Q3/17 at the latest.

Natural gas sales volumes are expected to be flat
in 2017 versus 2016. Due to oversupply on the
European gas market, natural gas sales margins
are expected to be lower in 2017 compared to 2016.
Considering the change in tariff regulation, the
contribution from the gas transportation business
in Austria (Gas Connect Austria) is expected to be
significantly lower in 2017 in comparison to 2016.

Risk Management

In common with the entire oil and gas industry,

OMV is exposed to a variety of risks — including
market and financial risks, operational risks and
strategic risks.

> Market and financial risks arise from volatility
in the prices of commodities, foreign exchange
(FX) rates or interest rates. Also of importance
are credit risks, which arise from the inability of
a counterparty to meet a payment or delivery
commitment. As an oil and gas company, OMV
has a significant exposure to oil and gas prices.
Substantial FX exposures include the USD,
RON, NOK and TRY.

> Operational risks include all risks related to
physical assets, HSSE, regulatory/compliance
risks or project risks.

> Strategic risks arise, for example, from changes
in technology, risks to reputation or political
uncertainties. OMV operates in countries that
are subject to political uncertainties, in particular
Libya, Yemen, Pakistan, Tunisia and Turkey.
Possible political changes may lead to disrup-
tions and limitations in production as well as
increased tax burden, restrictions on foreign
ownership or even nationalization of property.

It is OMV’s view that the Group’s overall risk is sig-
nificantly reduced due to its substantial diversifi-
cation and the related, partially offsetting effects of
different risks. The balancing effects of offsetting
industry risks, however, can often lag or weaken.
Therefore, OMV's risk management activities focus
on the Group-wide net risk exposure of the exist-
ing and future portfolio. The interdependencies and
correlations between different risks are also re-
flected in the company’s consolidated risk profile.
The areas of risk management and insurance are
centrally coordinated at the corporate level within
the Corporate Finance department, which ensures
that well-defined and consistent risk management
processes, tools and techniques are applied across
the entire organization. Risk ownership is assigned
to those managers who are best suited to oversee
and manage the related risk.

The overall objective of the risk policy is to safe-
guard the cash flows required by the Group and to
maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating
in line with the Group’s risk appetite. The success
of OMV’s strategy execution is secured through a
comprehensive strategic risk management process
(top-down exercise) that ensures that uncertainties
around the company strategy are properly ad-
dressed.

Financial risks (e.g. market prices, currencies) are
reviewed quarterly by the Financial Risk Commit-
tee. A cross-functional committee with senior
management members of the OMV Group - the
Risk Committee - ensures that an Enterprise Wide
Risk Management (EWRM) program is in place
to effectively manage the integrated risks across
the OMV Group.

EWRNM is continuously enhanced. The main purpose
is to deliver value through risk-based management
decision-making. Assessment of financial, opera-
tional and strategic risks supports the exploitation
of business opportunities in a systematic manner
in order to ensure sustainable growth in OMV's
value. Since 2003, the EWRM system has helped
to enhance risk awareness and risk management
skills across the entire organization, including
within subsidiaries in more than 20 countries.

OMV ANNUAL REPORT 2016 / DIRECTORS’ REPORT

The risk culture is supported by an IT application
facilitating the risk management processes estab-
lished within OMV Group: risk identification, risk
analysis, risk evaluation, risk treatment, reporting
and risk review through continuous surveillance of
changes to the risk profile. Overall risk resulting
from the bottom-up risk management process is
computed with the aid of Monte Carlo simulations
and compared against planning data. This is fur-
ther combined with a senior management view
from a top-down approach to capture the strategic
risks. This process also includes those companies
that are not fully consolidated. Twice a year, the
results from this process are consolidated and
presented to the Executive Board and the Audit
Committee. In compliance with the Austrian Code
of Corporate Governance, the effectiveness of the
EWRM system is evaluated by the external auditor
on an annual basis. The key non-financial and
financial risks identified with respect to OMV’s
medium-term plan are market price risks, political
risks, regulatory and compliance risks, business
process risks, foreign exchange risks, project risks,
personnel risks and hazard risks.

OMV has extensive experience in the political
environment in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE)
and Southeastern Europe (SEE). Political develop-
ments in all markets where OMV operates are kept
under constant observation. Furthermore, country-
specific risks are assessed before entering new
countries. Risks related to the EU Emission Trading
Scheme (EU ETS) are separately recorded and
aggregated for the Group as a whole. Furthermore,
OMV is monitoring emerging regulations related
to climate change in all operating countries.
Through systematic staff succession and develop-
ment planning, Corporate Human Resources plans
for suitable managerial staff to meet future growth
requirements in order to mitigate personnel risks.

Control and mitigation of assessed risks takes
place at all organizational levels using clearly
defined risk policies and responsibilities. The key
Group risks are governed centrally to ensure the
ability to meet the planning objectives, through
the essence of corporate directives, including
those relating to health, safety, security and envi-
ronment, legal matters and compliance, human
resources and corporate social responsibility, with
special emphasis on human rights and market
price risks.

Analysis and management of financial risks arising
from foreign currencies, interest rates, commodity
prices, counterparties, liquidity and insurable
risks are undertaken in a consolidated way at the
corporate level. Market price risk is monitored and
analyzed centrally as to the potential cash flow
impact using a specific risk analysis model that
considers portfolio effects. Results of the risk anal-
ysis are discussed by the Financial Risk Committee,
which is comprised of senior management of

the Business Segments and corporate functions.
Proposals for hedging strategies are submitted to
the Executive Board for approval.

To protect the Group’s cash flow from the potential
negative impact of falling oil and gas prices, OMV
uses derivative instruments for hedging purposes.
From the hedging strategy introduced in 2015, a
EUR 12 mn valuation gain on the January to June
2016 hedging instruments was recycled to profit
and loss from other comprehensive income in 2016.
Furthermore, a range of new financial swaps for
both oil and gas volumes was entered into during
2016, resulting in a total 2016 EBIT impact from
these hedges of EUR (6) mn.

In the Downstream business, OMV is especially
exposed to volatile refining margins and inventory
risks. In order to mitigate those risks correspond-
ing hedging activities are taken. Those include
margin hedges as well as stock hedges. In addition,
Emission Compliance Management takes care of

a balanced position of emission allowances via
selling the surplus or covering the gap.

The primary foreign currency risks are related to
USD, RON, NOK andTRY currency exposure. The
Group has a net USD long position, mainly result-
ing from sales of oil and gas production. To balance
the Group’s interest rate portfolio, loans can be
converted from fixed to floating rates and vice
versa according to predefined rules. The main
counterparty credit risks are assessed, monitored
and controlled at the Group and segment level
using predetermined credit limits for all counter-
parties, banks and security providers. The proce-
dures are governed by guidelines at the OMV,
OMV Petrom and OMV Petrol Ofisi level.

Non-financial Performance Measures

Sustainability and HSSE (Health, Safety,
Security and Environment)

Sustainability

OMV has a long tradition of responsible behavior
towards the environment and society. The OMV
sustainability strategy “Resourcefulness” brings
together the commitments on health, safety, secu-
rity, environment, business ethics, human rights,
diversity and stakeholder engagement.

Health, Safety and Security

Health, Safety and Security are key values of OMV's
business. The physical and mental health, well-
being and safety of the people, as well as the
integrity of OMV’s operating facilities, are of essen-
tial importance. Loss prevention and proactive risk
management are essential in maintaining OMV’s
social acceptance and to reach OMV's HSSE vision
“ZERO harm — NO losses.”

In 2016, the combined Lost-Time Injury Rate (LTIR)
for own employees and contractors was 0.40 (2015:
0.27), and the combined Total Recordable Injury
Rate (TRIR) was 0.69 (2015: 0.73).

An unstable geopolitical landscape with enduring
regional conflicts resulted in the security emphasis
for 2016 remaining primarily focused on the
Middle East and North Africa. Notwithstanding

the challenges of continuing to operate securely in
the distressed regions of Libya, Pakistan, Tunisia,
Turkey and Yemen, the threat and reality of terrorist
attacks on mainland Europe and elsewhere in-
creased significantly. OMV’s established crisis
management and security travel management
procedures provided a reassuring degree of miti-
gation and control during 2016.

Non-financial performance indicators — safety’

Environmental management

OMV is strongly committed to act on climate
change mitigation and responsible resource man-
agement and has therefore set targets to manage
and reduce the carbon footprint of its operations
and products. The key target is to reduce OMV’s
overall greenhouse gas emission intensity by 10%
by 2021 as compared to 2013. Overall, emission
savings of more than 50,000 t CO2 were achieved
in 2016 at the refineries.

OMV'‘s business principles and approach

OMV strives to uphold equally high compliance
standards at all locations. A dedicated cross-
regional compliance organization, consisting of
42 compliance experts, ensures that OMV stan-
dards are consistently met across the Group.

In 2016, more than 2,100 employees were trained
to ensure compliance with internal as well as
external regulations and laws. OMV is a signatory
of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and
fully committed to the UN Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights.

Community relations and development

OMV has been successful in promoting the social
benefits of its operations while running an efficient
business in the operating countries. In 2016, more
than 3,700 external beneficiaries (2015: 3,700)
received training and education for exploiting bet-
ter economic opportunities.

Employees

OMV is committed to having an engaged workforce
at all operating locations across the globe. The
employees are the basis for success in the longer
term. Fair and equal treatment of employees is
high on the Human Resources Department agenda
and is fundamental in the way employees work
together. OMV believes that high-performing,
diverse teams and an inspiring work environment
lead to better business results and help create a
great place to work, based on Principles of Team
Spirit, Accountability, Passion, Pioneering Spirit
and Performance.

OMV is offering stretching career experiences and
assignments, opportunities to learn from others
and through targeted skills and competency train-
ing. There is a continuous focus on the strong talent
pipeline that is key for a more competitive and
resilient company.

At OMV, there is no difference in entry salaries
with regard to gender, nationality or other criteria,
and salary equality is encouraged at all career
stages.

OMV is committed to the Group’s Diversity
Strategy. In terms of gender diversity, the target
is to have 30% women in Senior Vice President
positions by 2020. As of December 31, 2016,
women held 23% of Senior Vice President posi-
tions (17% in 2015) and international (non-
Austrian) employees held 41% (45% in 2015).

At the end of 2016, OMV employed 22,544 employ-
ees in 23 different countries.

Research and development

The innovation effort at OMV is focused on imple-
menting ideas that will bring benefits to OMV
customers, the environment and the Company
itself. In 2016, OMV prepared the first scale-up step
for a project, which uses plastic waste to produce
synthetic crude in a pyrolysis process. As part of
the research project wind2hydrogen, OMV is work-
ing with partners on ways to produce “green
hydrogen” from renewable electricity, which can
be stored for use, whenever it is convenient for
consumers. Together with its partners, OMV is run-
ning a pilot plant in Auersthal, Austria, to study
dynamic hydrogen production. OMV is also a pio-
neer of hydrogen filling stations in Austria. The
first filling station was opened in 2012 and further
stations started operation in Innsbruck and Asten.
Additional filling stations are planned to open in
2017 in Graz and Wiener Neudorf. In Germany,
there are two OMV hydrogen filling stations in
operation, and three OMV hydrogen filling stations
have been finalized and will be commissioned in
2017 in Bavaria and Baden-Wiirttemberg. OMV is
also preparing options for the long-term future. At
the Christian Doppler Laboratory in Cambridge,
Erwin Reisner and his team are developing a more
environmentally sound process for generating
Synthesis Gas (SynGas) from carbon dioxide and
water, a process which would be both renewable
and CO,-neutral. SynGas can be transformed into
liquid fuel such as petrol or diesel and is widely
used as a chemical feedstock.

8.a) A hybrid bond with a size of EUR 750 mn was

placed on the market on May 25, 2011. As the
repayment of principal and the payments of
interest are solely at the discretion of OMV,
according to IFRS, the proceeds of the hybrid
bond (less costs of issuance) were fully treated
as equity. The hybrid bears a fixed interest rate
of 6.75% until April 26, 2018, thereafter a reset
fixed rate (to be determined) until April 26,
2023, and thereafter a floating interest rate
with a 100-basis-point step up. The hybrid
bond has no scheduled maturity date and may
be redeemed at the option of OMV under cer-
tain circumstances. OMV has, in particular, the
right to repay the hybrid bond at certain dates.
In the case of a change of control, OMV may
call the hybrid bond for redemption or else the
applicable interest rate will be subject to an
increase according to the terms and conditions
of the hybrid bond.

b) On December 7, 2015, OMV issued hybrid notes
with an aggregate size of EUR 1.5 bn, in two
tranches of EUR 750 mn each. As the repayment
of principal and the payments of interest are
solely at the discretion of OMV, according to
IFRS, the proceeds of the hybrid notes (less
costs of issuance) are fully treated as equity.
Tranche 1 bears a fixed interest coupon of
5.250% until, but excluding, December 9, 2021,
which is the first call date of tranche 1, and
tranche 2 bears a fixed interest coupon of
6.250% until, but excluding, December 9, 2025,
which is the first call date of tranche 2. From
December 9, 2021, until, but excluding, Decem-
ber 9, 2025, hybrid notes of tranche 1 will bear
interest according to a fixed reset interest rate
to be determined according to the relevant
five-year swap rate and an additional margin
of 4.942% and, from December 9, 2025, with
an additional step up of 100 basis points. From
December 9, 2025, hybrid notes of tranche 2
will bear interest according to a fixed reset
interest rate to be determined according to the
relevant five-year swap rate and an additional
margin of 5.409%, with an additional step up
of 100 basis points. The hybrid notes have no
scheduled maturity date and may be redeemed
at the option of OMV under certain circum-
stances. OMV has, in particular, the right to
repay the hybrid notes at certain dates. In the
case of a change of control, OMV may call
the hybrid notes for redemption or else the
applicable interest rate will be subject to an
increase according to the terms and conditions
of the hybrid notes.
