Benefits
With drebis, law firms have a direct,
electronic connection to the legal expenses
and car insurance sector. Enquiries concerning
legal expenses coverage can be answered within
two days thanks to the electronic exchange of data,
while cost accounts for legal expenses are processed
immediately. Documenting all the necessary data in
a structured format eliminates the need for additio-
nal queries from the legal expenses insurer. Case
handlers are relieved of purely administrative
tasks, thus saving costs and time, and
making processes much easier
and faster.

Annual Report 2013

With its launch of the in|BOUND solution for com-
mercial gaming operators, adesso has responded to
the new statutory requirements governing online
gambling as well as to the regionalisation of gaming
activities. The solution, which the commercial
gaming providers in Germany can use to cater for
all 16 state lotteries in compliance with the law

and through just one central interface, has been
available since the middle of 2013. The background
to its development was the newly enacted regula-
tory requirement that orders for traditional lottery
products such as 6 aus 49, Eurojackpot, Gliickspirale
and Keno have to be transmitted to the lottery in
the state in which the player is resident. With 16
different gaming systems and three different
producers, this entails considerable development,
testing and integration effort for each gaming
operator. in| BOUND makes the mediation process
significantly easier by having just one technical
interface. Various compensation models are
available for using adesso in| BOUND, including
transaction-based tariffs.

Koy)

in|FOCUS
adesso has already licensed its significantly
more extensive in| FOCUS solution to several state
lottery companies, as they can easily use it to expand
their traditional sales channels. Like in| BOUND, in|-
FOCUS solves typical interface problems, but with the focus

on the gaming operator that is looking fora direct channel
to the customer. in| FOCUS from adesso is a system for the
direct sale of lottery products on all online sales channels.

In addition, the system performs important integration

tasks, such as connecting external systems for proces-

sing dedicated functions, for example payment tran-
sactions, linking to the central lottery system, ———_

verification of identity, ERP integration

and campaign support.

Technical implementation

The technical implementation for the regio-
nalisation of gaming in in|BOUND is organised

as a web service that uses standardised formats to

provide the necessary functions for allocating gaming
activities . This intermediate layer is used to abstract
from the specific technical connection to the central
systems. The operation and the link to the state lot-
tery companies are guaranteed by adesso, which
also implements any changes to interfaces. In
this process, the interface to the portal of the
commercial gaming operators is left
unchanged as far as possible.

Customers
in| BOUND is an attractive solu-
tion for commercial gaming opera-
tors in Germany. The first customers
have already signed up and other
operators have expressed their
interest since the solution was Remuneration models
launched. Commercial gaming operators can use the
in|BOUND platform to transmit orders to the
respective central systems of the lottery companies
using a variety of remuneration models. These models
take into consideration the business conditions of the indi-
vidual customer. In addition to monthly flat rates based on
usage, a complete transaction-based remuneration model

enables a functional connection to the systems of the

state lotteries without any start-up costs or risk for

the company itself and without any major

project expenditure. In return, adesso
takes a share in each individual

gaming order.
Lottery expertise
adesso has been working for state
lotteries for many years and has extensive
knowledge of the gaming and central sys-
tems, operators, transmission protocols and
technical interfaces. With in |BOUND, this
expertise has been merged into an attractive
solution. Asa result, adesso has additio-
nally developed further access to the
industry segment of commercial
gaming operators in the

Market outlook
Playing the lottery on the Internet became legal
again in Germany when the First State Treaty amen-
ding the State Treaty regarding Gambling (Erster Gliicks-
spielanderungsstaatsvertrag — GliiAndStV) was passed in
mid-2012. Before the ban, game sales of around EUR 500
million a year were generated in this market by commercial
gaming operators — who also claimed their commission. Thanks
to the new regulatory requirements, the marketis still currently
ina process of development. At the moment, around 300,000
customers are registered with around 20 commercial gaming
operators, and the trend is clearly on the rise. Thanks to
adesso’s renown in the lottery industry and the refe-
rences from current in| BOUND users, adesso sees
itself very well positioned in the market
to benefit from the resurgence in
internet lottery games.

—-> “The classification and qualification of
paper-based or electronic damage claims
regularly generates a great deal of
administrative work on the part of case
handlers at insurance companies.

The categorisation for the actual
processing is based here in many cases
on recurring patterns. If these patterns
could be recognised electronically, the
case handlers would have more time to

future for the customer as part of a

adesso has developed a new process for structuring
and automatically evaluating damage claims, in
which new notifications of claims are recorded
electronically and assessed using self-learning
software. The previous time-consuming manual
process for sorting claims according to defined
specifications and then forwarding them for further
processing is gradually being replaced as a result.
The method can also be employed in other areas of
the insurance business and other sectors and offers
the basis for scalable business models, especially
using case-based remuneration. Using text ana-
lysis based on valid statistical and heuristic data,
the solution simplifies and shortens the process for
assessing damage and, indirectly, the time it takes

to settle a claim. —

New type of premium for
IT services
Heuristic claims management (HCM) is the first
solution from adesso in the new field of business
process outsourcing (BPO), an area that will be expanded
with other solutions and that represents a new channel
for the configuration of IT services in the premium
segment. Based on its own experience in the sector, adesso
will thus assume part of the business risk of the customer,
but in return benefit from long-term commitments with
attractive margins. Each optimisation of the process that
adesso is responsible for will produce an increase in

the contribution margin, while the customer
profits from low start-up costs as well asa
reduction in their own administra-
tive expenses.

Customers
DEVK is the first company that adesso has
attracted for the heuristic claims management
(HCM) service. Based ona three-year contract with an
order value of around EUR 1.5 million, all new notifica-
tions of claim at DEVK’s legal expenses insurance division
will be processed by adesso’s solution and assessed using
HCM from the middle of 2014. More than 100,000 claims _
are expected to be handled in the first year of deployment
alone, while the newly developed solution offers attrac-
tive opportunities for a wider market. In particular,
insurers that are licensed to use the drebis soft-
ware are potential additional customers who
could follow DEVK’s example as
forward-looking provider.

Technology
Using text analysis based on valid stati-
stical and heuristic data, the solution simpli-
fies and shortens the process for assessing damage
and, indirectly, the time it takes to settle a claim. The
self-learning algorithms ensure that the recognition
rates improve with each new case that is processed. The
systems will initially be taught by insurance specia-
lists, who will be recruited by adesso specifically for
this task. adesso is the first provider in the Ger- Business Process Outsourcing

specialist knowledge, adesso is increasingly able
to expand its own value chain to the core tasks of its
customers, with the result that adesso can take over
an entire key technical process on behalf of the custo-

on the HCM method.

mer, for example creating case files for claims. This is an

attractive solution for customers, as it means they are
free to concentrate on their value added work. Based
on its additional technical expertise, adesso is able
to further optimise the processes it takes over

growth and earnings potential for

the company.

The PS | Life software solution is an innovative
policy management and benefit system for life
insurance in adesso’s portfolio that can be used

to quickly and cost-effectively model insurance
products and that can also be integrated into
existing systems. The solution is based entirely

on freely available, proven Java frameworks

and has been implemented consistently on the
paradigm of model-driven development.

The software is marketed as a total system or in
system components and can be adapted, integrated
or further developed to customer-specific require-
ments on request. The range of services within the
environment of the solution extends from actuarial
consultancy through agency services, system
launch and integration and migration all the way

New remuneration channels
Requiring a great deal of time and effort, the
development of complex software solutions is a
challenging undertaking, especially when it involves
developing a new universal system from scratch. This kind
of developmentis less risky if the software company coopera-
tes closely with the future customer as early as the development
phase. adesso has taken an innovative path in the creation of the
PS|Life solution, developing the solution with the life insurance
customer Barmenia Lebensversicherung on a project basis, but
taking product aspects into account from the very beginning
and securing in the process the rights to the future dist-
tribution of the solution at the same time. adesso, has
already been able to sell the solution along with
accompanying services to two more custo-
mers, and Barmenia is using PS | Life at
a preferential price.

Although the market for life insurance appears
straightforward with comparatively few provi-
ders, project sales for the introduction, further
development and maintenance of the soft-
ware are also attractive for adesso in EE

— “To modernise or replace obsolete appli-
cations, lines of code have to be trans-
lated into a contemporary programming
language and old databases have to be
converted into an up-to-date format.
The migration frequently involves manual
work and therefore requires a lot of time
and effort; it’s also prone to errors. If it
were possible for these processes to be
automated on a standardised basis, then
a great deal of time and money would be

saved on a project.”

The automated migration of applications
and data is already possible using tried
and trusted solutions today. adesso has

developed it.

adesso Group

Annual Report 2013

Against the background of the increasing
networking of applications and the provision of
user-friendly services, the wish to transfer older
software systems to a future-proof platform is
frequently expressed.

However, a complete migration to a modern appli-
cation system is an extremely complex process and,
with one eye on the costs, cannot always be justi-
fied financially. With Transformer, adesso offers

a solution that transfers old existing applications
to a modern application system at little expense

by automatically translating Cobol, PL/| and other
programming languages of previous generations
into modern Java code. adesso has another solution
for the tamper-proof migration of databases, the
adesso MIG| Suite, which enables old data-bases
to be imported, analysed, prepared for integration
in the analysing system and finally automatically
transferred to the target format according to
defined rules. Very old databases that are no longer
required for operations, but must be kept available,
for example for auditing purposes, are maintained
in the MIG|Suite, where they no longer pose a
burden for the new system. The takeover process

is markedly simplified. Both solutions have already
proved their worth in several projects, with the
transformation time drastically reduced thanks to

automated processing. —

Financial significance
In many companies, IT systems that have been
expanded over decades represent an investment.
Replacing them with a completely new development
purely for technological reasons is hard to justify in
financial terms. In many IT modernisation projects, a
large part of the IT budget is allotted to the migration
of old databases. Thanks to their high efficiency,
the new solutions offer in both cases signifi-
cant potential for increasing the contribution
margins of adesso commissions. What’s
more, the licence revenue creates
extra added value.

Remuneration models
The complexity involved in the modernisation
ofan application system can be evaluated among
other things by the lines of code to be transformed. In
the area of data transfer, the remuneration is generally
calculated by the number of data sets that are successfully
migrated. Every reduction in the time and human resour-
ces that would have been required in a conventional mig-
ration offers potential for an attractive remuneration
for the use of the solution. adesso is thus able to score
points in the competition for migration projects
through lower prices, which nevertheless offer
sufficient scope for a high contribution
margin thanks to the extensive auto-
mation involved.

GROUP PRINCIPLES

Business Model, Targets and
Strategies

adesso is a fast growing IT services company which
has set its sights on becoming one of the leading
consulting and technology groups for industry-
specific business processes in Central Europe. With
ahigh level of expertise in the areas it caters to, adesso
operates at the interface between business proces-
ses and IT, implementing software projects at the
highest technical level. By developing its own soft-
ware solutions, adesso increases its market penetra-
tion, carving out a prominent position in IT topics of
the future such as mobilisation or enterprise content
management. adesso pursues the internationali-
sation of its own product sales as a strategic goal.
Enterprise development is complemented by a well-
defined acquisition strategy.

Fuelled by past growth and growth in the making,
a focused business model and an insistence on out-
performing industry average margins, the company’s
value is continually being enhanced. adesso puts signi-
ficant resources in targeted business development, the
expansion of sales capacities, recruiting and marketing.
These investments, coupled with extensive industry
and consulting expertise, make growth rates possible
which exceed the industry average by far. adesso is a
leading technology company in the field of software
development which invests more than average in the
training and development of its workforce and in the
ongoing development of its own model for the soft-
ware development process.

The Executive Board is committed to a strategy of
striving for the right balance of growth, solid finances
and profitability.

For 2013, the Executive Board set sales growth tar-
gets well above the market average of 7 % to 9 % of
between EUR 129 million and EUR 131 million,
operating profit, measured as EBITDA, of between
EUR 7.5 million and EUR 8.0 million, and an increase
in the EBITDA margin of between 5.8 % and 6.1 %.
The sales and EBITDA targets were reached; the
targeted margin was narrowly missed.

Employees and Structure

Founded in 1997, adesso had a total of 1,221 emplo-
yees (FTE) in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Eng-
land, Turkey, and the USA at the end of 2013. While
adesso Group employs 115 staff outside of Ger-
many, 768 employees are deployed in Germany
and work for the parent adesso AG, which repre-
sents the largest operating unit in addition to the
holding company. adesso AG’s largest location is
Dortmund which is also the city in which the com-
pany was founded and where its corporate head-
quarters are located. To stay close to its customers
and keep travel costs as low as possible, adesso
maintains eight other offices in all of Germany’s
major economic regions. Worldwide locations
are Boston, Istanbul, London, Vienna and Zurich.

In addition to adesso AG, the largest operating unit
and majority-owned parent company, the Group also
includes consolidated subsidiaries of subsidiaries
and a joint venture company as of the reporting date.
adesso has two different segments: IT Services
and IT Solutions. While the IT Services segment
offers customised, project-oriented services in the
areas of consulting and software development, the
IT Solutions businesses market their own solutions
in the shape of home-grown products or standard
software products. The company is publicly traded
and listed on German stock exchanges (ISIN code:
DE000A0Z23Q5, WKN [national security identi-
fication number]: AOZ23Q).

Management System

adesso AG spearheads adesso Group and defines the
strategy and operational targets of all group com-
panies. It controls the legally independent group
companies by implementing a target system, an on-
going reporting process and by occupying positions
in the supervisory bodies. Operational control
is ensured by a reporting system which has been
implemented group-wide. In the process, each group
company prepares full monthly financial statements
based on national legal regulations. Key performance
indicators featured in the reports are sales, EBITDA,
pre-tax earnings (EBT), EBT margin, number and
proportion of employees not operating at full capacity,
headcount and net liquidity. The most important

performance indicators are subject to continuous
comparisons with plan and actual data. All indicators
are carried forward and subject to an internal group
benchmark. An updated rolling forecast will be created
for the full year in order to detect possible deviations
for each group company early on. Fixed reporting
channels and cycles have been defined and there is
also a fixed appointment schedule for management
meetings. There are no fundamental differences
between key performance indicators in the reporting
systems for each segment.

Research and Development

The bulk of adesso’s turnover is generated through
its sales in IT services. With few exceptions, adesso
solutions represent the core of project solutions
which are then tailored to customer requirements
in client-specific projects. Research expenses in
IT Solutions segment are negligible in relation to
group expenses. None of the group companies has
its own dedicated research department.

ECONOMIC REPORT

Macroeconomic Climate and
Industry-specific Conditions

Macroeconomic Climate

Economic growth in Germany again slowed slightly
in 2013 for the third consecutive year. After GDP
growth of 0.7 % in the previous year, 2013 only saw
0.4 % growth. Although the German economy was
stable this year on average, the ongoing recession
in some European countries and subdued global
economic development still weighed on growth,
especially in the 2012/2013 winter months. How-
ever, the German economy was robust during the
year, supported mainly by the domestic economic
activity and record employment levels. The Federal
Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy expects this
upward trend to continue, based on sentiment indi-
cators and the improving global economic outlook as
wellas decreasing uncertainty regarding the financial
and debt crisis in the eurozone. The economy is

expected to recover significantly, as private consump-
tion continues to be strong due to the stable labour
market and exports are again rising slightly. The Fede-
ral Government forecasts a GDP increase of 1.8 %
in 2014.

Industry-specific Conditions

According to investigations carried out by industry
association BITKOM, the German IT products and
services market expanded by 2.0 % to EUR 74.7
billion in 2013. Despite a further loss of momen-
tum, the IT market developed significantly better
than last year, growing by a factor of five compared
to the economy as a whole. While the software
segment lost some momentum, growing 4.9 % to
EUR 18.1 billion, adesso’s sales in its key IT Services
segment gained traction with an increase of 2.4 %.
The market volume of this segment now amounts
to EUR 35.7 billion. Industry-specific conditions
therefore continued to be positive for adesso’s
business performance.

Business Performance

There were no individual events that could be seen as
having significantly affected the business performance
in the reporting period. However, it should be noted
that halting a project in Austria weighed on results,
as did he partial goodwill impairment of its Austrian
subsidiary.

Overall Statement on Business Performance by the
Management

adesso Group was able to improve sales and operating
earnings by 13 % and 16 % year on year respectively,
achieving its 2013 targets in those key figures. The
results within the Group varied. While business in
Germany was very positive, especially at adesso AG,
the Group did not reach its targets for the two already
established subsidiaries in Austria and Switzerland as
well as for further internationalisation. In the USA,
adesso made valuable progress in 2013 in establish-
ing partners, prominence and expanding its sales
pipeline, investing EUR 1.0 million despite lower
sales. The Group successfully restructured the Uti-
lities business areain 2013 atacost of EUR 0.6 million,
and it has been integrated as a line of business within
adesso AG. Earnings per share rose from EUR 0.12 to
EUR 0.48, and the Executive Board has proposed to
increase the dividend by 17 % to EUR 0.21 per share.

Growth in Sales

In financial year 2013, adesso increased its sales from
EUR 120.5 million to EUR 136.2 million, which
amounted to sales growth of 13 %. Of this, 10 per-
centage points was organic growth and 3 percentage
points was accounted for by subsequent effects from
the majority takeover of Arithnea GmbH at the begin-
ning of the second quarter of financial year 2012.
With market growth of 2.4 %, adesso once again had
higher organic growth than the market in 2013.

During the year, sales revenues continuously increa-
sed from the first to the third quarter to a new high
of EUR 35.6 million. In the fourth quarter, sales
revenues came in slightly below the third quarter
due to value adjustments for a major project. Over-
all, sales in the second half of the year increased 9 % to
EUR 5.6 million compared to the first half of the year,
due to the higher number of potential working days,
the continued increase in the number of employees
as well as higher licence sales.

In the IT Services segment, the German adesso sub-
sidiary increased sales significantly by 25 %, while the
subsidiary in Austria reported stable sales revenues
and the Swiss subsidiary reported a 9 % decline,
largely due to massive budget cuts at one of its
major clients. Sales in the “Expert Resourcing” area
grew substantially at 7 %. The new business activi-
ties in Turkey in the area of Transformer and Smart
Hosting & Cloud Services have also contributed to
sales growth in the IT Services segment.

In the IT Solutions segment, Content Solutions
managed to slightly increase licence and maintenance
sales for in-house high-end content management
system FirstSpirit, while investments in interna-
tionalisation did not result in notable sales. Mobile
Solutions once again significantly increased its sales
by 27 %. One of the fastest growing areas in IT is
mobilising web content and business processes.
In Germany, adesso is a leading provider in enterprise
mobility with its own in|MOTION technology along
with proven expertise in the development of mobile
applications and integration of knowledge of core
business processes of adesso customers.

Economic Report

The IT Services segment reported an increase of 14%
and the IT Solutions segmenta rise of 3 %.

Sales generated from many of adesso’s top ten clients
increased by millions. The share of sales generated
from the top ten clients rose compared to overall
sales. adesso was therefore able improve its position
as strategic IT partner with those clients.

Higher sales were generated in all established core
industries, including insurance, banking, lottery and
public administration. In healthcare, sales remained
stable, while sales in the energy industry declined
34 %, partly due to restructuring. “Cross Industries”
outside the core industries maintained the previous
year’s high level of sales. In insurance, adesso reported
a particularly strong sales revenue increase of 30 %.

The export business declined due to negative
developments in Switzerland. Product sales to other
countries did not increase in 2013, despite increased
activities in the USA. The proportion of export sales
fell from 19% to 17 %.

Earnings

At sales growth of 13%, the average number of
employees (full-time equivalents, FTE) rose slightly
above average by 15 % or 149 employees to 1,156 in
2013. Year on year, the material usage ratio declined
10.7 % (previous year: 11.4%) and gross profit per
employee fell slightly by 1 % to EUR 105 thousand
(previous year: EUR 106 thousand). The slight
decrease is largely because sales did not increase
proportionally to the greater number of employees
associated with internationalisation, as well as weak
performance in Austria and Switzerland.

At EUR 2.1 million, other operating income fell
by EUR 0.7 million year on year. The 2012 results
included the release of a financial liability at
EUR 878 thousand for the elimination of a condi-
tional purchase price increase, which was related to
exercising an option under a purchase contract for
shares in evu.it GmbH.

Like last year, the 6 % increase in cost of materials to
EUR 14.6 million (previous year: EUR 13.8 million),
mainly for the involvement of subcontractors in

projects, was lower than the rise in sales. A higher
proportion of sales was therefore generated with own
employees. Gross profit (sales revenues less cost of
materials) rose faster than sales by 14 % to EUR 121.6
million (previous year: EUR 106.8 million) as a
result. Personnel costs also increased by 14 % to
EUR 88.2 million. Average expenses per employee
decreased slightly by 1 % to EUR 76 thousand. The
decrease is due to structural changes and not because
of reductions among existing employees. The year-
on-year change in personnel costs therefore had a
neutral effect on the operating margin.

Other operating expenses increased 8 % to EUR 27.7
million (previous year: EUR 25.8 million), mainly
due to the greater number of employees. Additional
office space was leased, and recruitment agency fees
that once again increased were paid. Cost items such
as travel expenses, vehicle and training costs tend to
rise proportionally with each employee. Total other
operating expenses increased less than sales and the
number of employees, meaning these types of costs
affected the margin positively.

Total operating earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased
by 16% or EUR 1.1 million to EUR 7.8 million (pre-
vious year: EUR 6.7 million) in 2013. As such, the
targets for 2013 were met. The operating EBITDA
margin came in at 5.7 % from 5.6 % previously.

Income increased significantly in the second half of
the year. After EBITDA of EUR 2.9 million and an
EBITDA margin of 4.5 % in the first half of 2013,
the results in the second half of the year increased to
EUR 4.9 million and 6.9 %, respectively. The improve-
mentis largely due to the success of the restructuring
measures in the energy sector, more potential work
days and higher licence sales.

Despite better results in Mobile Solutions, EBITDA
in IT Solutions decreased by 57 %, or EUR 1.0 million,
to EUR 0.8 million due to high investments in the
internationalisation of Content Solutions.

Depreciation and amortisation fell by EUR 1.2 mil-
lion to EUR 2.9 million in the reporting period.

This figure includes scheduled amortisation of intan-
gible assets such as customer lists and order back-
log from mergers in the amount of EUR 0.8 million
(previous year: EUR 1.4 million). It also includes
depreciation on property, plant and equipment,
which increased slightly by EUR 0.1 million to
EUR 1.3 million. Goodwill impairment losses of
EUR 0.8 million on the business unit in Austria
were also recognised in 2013. Impairment losses on
intangible assets had been recognised in the amount
of EUR 1.3 million related to the deconsolidation of
dynamicutilities GmbH iL. in the previous year.

The financial result came to EUR -219 thousand com-
pared to EUR 139 thousand in the previous year.
Earnings before taxes (EBT) increased considerably
by 91 % to EUR 4.6 million (previous year: EUR 2.4
million) due to higher operating earnings as well
as lower depreciation and amortisation. Income
tax expense was EUR 1.6 million (previous year:
EUR 2.5 million). In the previous year, tax expen-
ses had included a write-down of EUR 1.1 million
on the usable deferred taxes on loss carry-forwards

for adesso AG. The effects described above resulted
in positive consolidated earnings of EUR 3.0 mil-
lion in 2013 compared to EUR -0.1 million in the
previous year. The proportion of consolidated ear-
nings allocated to minority interests increased from
EUR -0.8 million in the previous year to EUR 0.2
million, due in particular to the elimination of the
pro-rata allocation of losses of the Utilities business
area in the previous year. Asa result, the proportion of
consolidated earnings allocated to adesso’s sharehol-
ders rose by 301 % from EUR 0.7 million to EUR 2.8
million. Earnings per share amounted to EUR 0.48
compared to EUR 0.12 in the previous year.

The Supervisory Board and Executive Board ofadesso

up 17 % or EUR 0.03 year on year, to the General

Orders

The order volume continued to increase in parallel
to sales growth. Demand remained consistently
dynamic in the course of the year. A general slump
in demand was not observed in any region, segment
or industry. Little new business was added in Aus-
triain 2013 because a major project dominated busi-
ness. Following the project stoppage in that country,
the order situation is challenging as of early 2014. In
Switzerland, however, the company received several
major orders at the start of 2014, indicating that the
weaker capacity utilisation from 2013 has apparently
been overcome. The order backlog on the repor-
ting date is comparable to previous years. Business
activities continue at the start of 2014 with the vast
majority of the leading customers for 2013.

Financial Position

Financial Management Principles and Objectives
adesso pursues a balanced financial policy. The objec-
tive of financial management is to assure short-term
liquidity, including a margin of safety, as well as to
secure and acquire financial assets to fund medium-
and long-term investment projects. In principle, the
company does not enter into investment transac-
tions with speculative elements. There are no variable

interest rates on investments. The maximum invest-
ment term is six months, with one to three months
being the most common in order to remain flexible
in response to investment opportunities that arise.
Central cash management based on daily account
clearing has not been set up. Bank borrowing is
centralised with the parent company. The account
balances and financial position of all companies are
transparent to the Group’s Executive Board, and con-
stitute a standard element of the monthly reporting
system. Off-balance-sheet financing, suchas leasing,
is utilised only to a minor extent for company vehicles
as wellas office furnishings and equipment. Factoring
or other methods of selling receivables are not used.

Capital Structure

Financing is needed primarily for the receivables
portfolio and services that have not been settled in
the amount of EUR 29.2 million (previous year:
EUR 29.3 million). Working capital (trade accounts
receivable plus receivables PoC less trade accounts
payable less liabilities PoC) was EUR 21.7 million
as of 31 December 2013 (previous year: EUR 22.0
million). Advance financing of business operations
therefore decreased slightly year on year, whereas
sales rose by 13 %. However, there were no signi-
ficant changes in customers’ payment patterns or
in receivables management. No additional loans
for acquisitions were taken out in 2013. The port-
folio of interest-bearing financial liabilities fell from
EUR7.7 million in the previous year to EUR 5.4 mil-
lion on the reporting date. The remaining terms of the
loans on the reporting date range from two months
to three years and three months. Interest is fixed over
the entire term. A fixed interest rate was secured fora
variable interest - bearing loan by means of an interest
rate swap. All interest - bearing liabilities are denomi-
nated in euros. Credit balances are largely available in
the short term and bear interest at fixed rates. Net
liquidity (liquidity less interest-bearing liabilities) is
EUR 16.4 million (previous year: EUR 13.7 million).

Investments, Acquisitions and Divestments

The adesso business model requires relatively low
investments in property, plant and equipment. The
property, plant and equipment of EUR 2.0 million
(previous year: EUR 2.0 million) largely consist of
hardware such as laptops and servers as well as office
furnishings. There are no significant subsequent
obligations from property, plant and equipment

investment projects as of 31 December 2013, and
no investment backlog to report. Several investments
were realised in the reporting period.

The acquisition of 51% of the shares in Arithnea
GmbH, Neubiberg near Munich, in the previous year
resulted in an additional payment of EUR 1.1 million
in 2013 as part of the conditional purchase price pay-
ment (earn out). The purchase of additional shares was
not one of the conditions.

adesso Transformer GmbH, a new adesso AG subsi-
diary, was founded in mid-2013 with the managing
director who until then had been active at adesso
Austria GmbH. adesso AG holds 51 % of the shares in
the company. The former managing director ofadesso
Austria GmbH holds the remaining shares. adesso
paid EUR 0.3 million of the capital. The aim ofadesso
Transformer GmbH is to address the market for the
modernisation of old applications by way of highly
automated and therefore inexpensive transforma-
tion. Investments in the development of the compa-
ny’s own transformers are necessary for this purpose.
The company’s registered office is in Vienna /Austria.

In mid-2013, adesso acquired the remaining 20%
of the shares in evu.it GmbH, which it had acquired
in 2010, fora price of EUR 1. Following the acqui-
sition of the remaining 20% and the integration of
evu.it GmbH’s business activities into adesso AG
as part of an asset deal, evu.it GmbH was renamed
percision services GmbH. percision services GmbH.
is a full-service IT personnel resource provider and
is being expanded within adesso Group to become a
provider of shared services. Further details regar-
ding the balance sheet impact are provided in the
consolidated notes.

adesso Turkey Bilgi Teknolojileri Limited Serketi was
founded as another fully owned subsidiary of adesso
AG in mid - 2013. The company is to be expanded to
becomea fully- fledged adesso subsidiary in order to
tap the fast-growing Turkish market. The company
is based in Istanbul / Turkey.

Comparatively high investments in office equipment
are forecast for the third quarter of 2014 due to the
planned move into the new Group headquarters in
Dortmund.

Liquidity

Cash and cash equivalents total EUR 21.8 million on
the reporting date (previous year: EUR 21.4 million).
They are partly offset by interest-bearing liabilities,
mainly from several acquisition loans, in the amount
of EUR 5.4 million (previous year: EUR 7.7 million).
As a result, net liquidity (liquidity less interest-
bearing liabilities) increased by EUR 2.7 million to
EUR 16.4 million (previous year: EUR 13.7 million).

Cash flow from operating activities rose noticeably
from EUR 0.4 million in the previous year to EUR7.7
million. This increase is largely due the EUR 2.2-
million increase in earnings before taxes as well as the
release of EUR 2.1 million resulting from the change
to net operating assets following the tying- up of
EUR 5.2 million in the previous year. Cash flow from
investment activities was EUR -1.2 million (pre-
vious year: EUR -2.6 million). In the previous year,
the net cash effect from the acquisition of Arithnea
GmbH led to an outflow from investment activities
of EUR 1.5 million. Investments of EUR 1.3 million
(previous year: EUR 1.5 million) in property, plant
and equipment for the acquisition of new hard-
ware and software as well as office furnishings and
equipment decreased slightly. A reduced amount of
EUR 0.1 million (previous year: EUR 0.4 million) was
paid out for investments in intangible assets. Cash
flow from financing activities was EUR -6.0 million
(previous year: EUR 1.1 million). The positive finan-
cing contribution in the previous year was largely the
result of taking outa new loan of EUR 5.0 million. In
2013, redemption payments on financial liabilities
amounted to EUR 4.3 million (previous year: EUR 3.0
million), of which EUR 1.1 million wasa subsequent
purchase price payment to the sellers of Arithnea
GmbH. Dividends of EUR 1.6 million (previous year:
EUR 1.1 million) were paid out, of which EUR 1.0
million went to adesso AG’s shareholders. Accor-
dingly, cash and cash equivalents increased by EUR 0.4
million, compared to a decrease of EUR 1.1 million
in the previous year.

As in the previous year, lines of credit with several
banks of EUR 1.7 million could be utilised. There was
no availment of credit lines on the reporting date.

Variable salary components are paid from cash and
cash equivalents and are paid out in the first few
months of 2014. This is typical for the business.
Overall, the liquidity of the adesso Group is adequate

Net Assets

Analysis of the Asset Structure

Total assets on the reporting date decreased year on
year by 2 % or EUR 1.6 million to EUR 75.3 million.
On the assets side, depreciation, amortisation and
impairment losses accounted for a decrease in good-
will (down EUR 0.8 million) and intangible assets
(down EUR 0.7 million) in particular. Current assets,
at EUR 53.3 million (compared to EUR 52.7 million
in the previous year), remained virtually unchanged
in terms of their value and composition. On the lia-
bilities side, financial liabilities in particular fell by
EUR 4.3 million, whereas equity and other current
liabilities rose by EUR 1.6 million and EUR 2.1 million
respectively. Equity amounted to EUR 36.1 million
compared to EUR 34.5 million in the previous year.
The equity ratio rose to 47.9 % compared to 44.8 %
in the previous year.

Financial and Non-financial Performance Indicators

FORECAST, OPPORTUNI-
TIES AND RISK REPORTS

Forecast Report

Group Orientation over the Next Two Financial Years

adesso’s vision of becoming one of Central Europe’s
leading IT consulting firms for industry-specific
business processes will be pursued with vigour. The
strategic guidelines for growth through industry seg-
mentation, portfolio expansion in IT Services, inter-
nationalisation and the expansion of the company’s
solution portfolio in the IT Solutions business area
will continue to determine what action adesso takes
over the next two years. The same acquisition policy
will be pursued. Irrespective of the acquisition policy,
organic growth will continue to be spurred on in all
industries and regions. The sales generated abroad are
to be increased in particular through further interna-
tionalisation of product sales at FirstSpirit and the
adesso subsidiary that is being established in Turkey.
The planned bundling of solutions for insurance
products, adesso insurance solutions GmbH, should
help adesso to position itselfincreasingly asa product
partner in addition to its strong positioning as a
sought-after IT service partner. Although adesso
Group aims to maintain its high pace of growth
and innovation, improving the operating EBITDA
margin will become a more important component of
the group’s strategic focus in the next two years.

Future Macroeconomic Situation

For the third consecutive year, economic momentum
in Germany declined to GDP growth of just 0.4% in
2013. According to the Federal Government, Ger-
many is in a sustained upward trend since the harsh
winter of 2012/2013. All sentiment indicators point
to the confidence of consumers and companies in a
positive economic development. GDP growth is the-
refore expected to be a more robust 1.8% in 2014.
Growth was driven by domestic demand, supported
by high levels of private and public spending. The sta-
ble labour market with its record employment levels
form the basis for this development. Germany’s
exports are increasingly profiting from the
continued improvement in economic conditions
plus the gradual recovery in the eurozone. A return
to stronger growth of 2.0 % is expected in 2015.

Based on information provided by an expert group
commissioned by the Swiss government, the Swiss
State Secretariat for Economic Affairs SECO is expec-
ting growth to accelerate to 2.3 %in 2014 and to 2.7%
in 2015 following 1.9 % in 2013. On the basis of fore-
casts published by the Austrian Institute of Economic
Research (WIFO) and the Institute for Advanced Stu-
dies (IHS), the Austrian Federal Ministry of Econo-
mics, Family and Youth is anticipating growth in
Austrian GDP of 1.7 % in 2014 and between 1.7 and
2.0 % in 2015.

Asa result, 2014 will once again offer a favourable
macroeconomic climate for adesso, even though it
still poses risks in view of current developments. The
key assumption for the government's projections is
that the financial sector will remain stable and that
there will be no negative developments, particularly

inthe eurozone, which would create renewed uncer-
tainty among market participants. However, due to
measures taken and the trend towards stabilisation
of the financial sector and the eurozone thus far, it
is not yet expected that the positive trend in terms
of further economic growth in adesso-relevant sec-
tors will take a turn for the worse in 2014 and 2015.

Future Industry Situation

According to industry association BITKOM, the IT
market in Germany will continue to progress far more
positively than the economy as a whole in 2014.
With market volume of EUR 74.7 billion in 2013,
the 2.8 % growth rate expected in 2014 is one percen-
tage point above that of GDP as a whole. Within the
IT sector, BITKOM forecasts 5.1 % growth in the soft-
ware segment, while the IT Services segment, which
is particularly relevant to adesso, is expected to grow


--- Page 36 ---

adesso Group

Annual Report 2013

by an above - average 3.2 %. The industry association
anticipates a further acceleration in growth in both
adesso’s relevant segments IT services and software.
Internally, adesso is anticipating growth of 3.5 % in
2014 in relevant markets in the DACH region.

Anticipated Sales and Earnings Situation

The report on risks and opportunities is a pivotal
part of management’s considerations of the further
development of adesso and of the forecast report.
Potential acquisitions are not included in the fore-
cast calculations.

Based on anticipated economic growth of 3.5 % in rele-

vant segments of the IT market as well as on internal

calculations, adesso’s management is expecting the

following in 2014:

> An increase in sales revenues of between 6 % and
9 % to between EUR 144 million and EUR 148
million (2013: EUR 136 million).

> The operating result, EBITDA, is expected to
amount to between EUR 8.5 million and EUR 9.0
million (2013: EUR 7.8 million) and therefore
increase by between 9 % and 16 %.

> The operating EBITDA margin is expected to rise
to more than 6.0 % (2013: 5.7 %).

Within the year, the second half of the year is expec-
ted to see a higher contribution to earnings. This is
because the second half of the year has 129 poten-
tial working days, which is 7 days or 6 % more than
the first half of the year. Based on previous years, this
makes an enormous difference. Moreover, experience
has shown that license sales are higher in the second
half of the year.

This growth, which is significantly above the industry
average, is expected to predominantly originate from
the IT Services business area. The expansion of the
headcount by 18 % in the adesso subsidiary in Ger-
many in 2013 also led to rising sales expectations.
Switzerland is also expected to register growth. Initial
projects are also expected in Turkey. In view of the
sustained high demand for consultancy services and
development for Enterprise Mobility, above-average
growth is also expected in adesso mobile solutions.

The planned increase in the operating result is prima-
rily based on the growth targets, the expectedimprove-
ment in results in Austria and Switzerland as well as
license sales in the USA. The full-year costs for the

expansion in Turkey as well as the development of
own transformers for highly automated updating
of host applications are likely to weigh on results.

For 2015, we are anticipating further sales growth
as well as further positive development of the
operating result.

Expected Financial Position

adesso’s liquid asset base is solid and will be sufficient
to cover financial obligations in 2014 should the fore-
cast business development come to fruition. adesso’s
balance sheet structure allows it to assume additio-
nal liabilities for investment projects to ensure that
there are no shortfalls in terms of financing. adesso
continues to strive fora positive net cash position.
Only in the event of the potential acquisition of an
unusually large or profitable company of extremely
high strategic value for adesso, would there be any
deviation from this strategy.

Based on this, the Executive Board is continuing to
pursue its dividend policy, which envisages a well-
balanced combination of investments in growth,
financial stability and the participation of sharehol-
ders in the company’s profit. If the profit targets can
be achieved toa large extent, the Executive Board will
strive to further increase the dividend. The dividend
proposed for 2014 will reflect actual developments.

Opportunities and Risk Report

Risk management is a pivotal component of all
decisions and business processes. In a wider con-
text, adesso understands risks as the danger of not
achieving financial and operating targets as planned
and, in the strictest sense, as factors endangering the
existence of the company. In order to safeguard the
success of the company over the long term, it is the-
refore essential that adesso identifies and analyses
risks efficiently and combats or mitigates them by
implementing sufficient control measures. adesso’s
active risk management therefore also opens up
opportunities for the company.

Risk Management System

adesso possesses a system of processes and data analy-
sis structures to monitor risks posed to the company.
An exclusive risk management software system is

developed by Corporate Planning AG for financial and
operational planningas wellas operational controlling.
All plan and actual data from all business areas is sto-
red ina central database for the purposes of reporting.
Current figures are inputted directly from financial
accounting. Current figures are inputted directly from
financial accounting. All companies included in the
scope of consolidation are part of the reporting system.

Fixed reporting channels have been established for
other risks, such as those arising from the absence of
contracts, high levels of receivables from customers
or projects that are threatening to go over budget.
Certain reporting thresholds apply, which, if brea-
ched, result in the issue being included on the agenda
of Executive Board meetings. Similar risks posed to
companies in adesso Group are identified through
close cooperation with the respective responsible
Executive Board member of adesso AG. adesso does
not have a central risk manager. Risk reporting and
assessment is documented in a risk manual. The risk
manual is submitted to the Supervisory Board so that
the risk management system can be acknowledged
and reviewed. Recognising opportunities and new
areas of business are just as important for the develop-
ment of adesso. Working groups consisting of the
Executive Board, Business Development, the manage-
ment of companies in adesso Group and heads
of business areas, meet on a regular basis to ana-
lyse new business opportunities and develop new
business models, industries, solutions or regions.
The progress made in implementing these measures
is presented at regular intervals.

Within the scope of a risk inventory, the following
risks were assessed as relevant to our business and
subsequently assessed in view of their probability
of occurrence and amount of loss. In principal, only
risks that would have negative implications for the
asset, financial or profit situation are listed here.

Moreover, adesso is potentially exposed to further
risks which may not be known or be considered as
major risks at the current time. The risk factor is
calculated from the probability of occurrence and
the amount of loss, which determines how relevant
the risk is. The following risks were identified as of
the reporting date and as of the preparation of the
management report as having a risk factor worthy of
inclusion in this report:

Primary Risk Carrier

Project Risks

In the event of the budgeted time frame and costs
being exceeded, fixed-price projects can lead to
project-related losses. Budget deviations are identi-
fied and analysed constantly during every fixed-price
project. There is also an escalation mechanism that
extends to the Executive Board. As of the reporting
date, there was one case where a customer refused
to accept delivery (previous year: several cases).
One customer claimed back payments totalling several
hundred thousand euros (previous year: several
customers /several hundred thousand euros). Several
projects presented for customer approval have not
yet been formally accepted by the customer, which
is normal business practice. The backlog of fixed-
price projects that have yet to be invoiced in full rose
year on year. Project risks are again anticipated to
have increased, as there are claims involving several
hundred thousand euros from legal disputes as well
as one extensive, high-loss fixed-price project in
Austria. The customer demanded the project be ter-
minated and negotiations are currently underway
to determine the value of the current development
stage. The inventory value of the project was subse-
quently reduced by EUR 900 thousand and recogni-
sed as an expense in financial year 2013. Moreover,
risks remain as to whether the remaining inventories
can be achieved through negotiations. A customer in
Austria has also threatened damage claims of up to
EUR 1.29 million for allegedly high subsequent costs
related to the software supplied as part of a project.
The claims are not yet pending in the courts.

At adesso, an Excel-based project controlling and
reporting system is used. Depending on the project
structure, sub-projects are defined and mapped on
adesso’s web-based project and schedule manage-
ment system. Expenses are distributed across the
sub-projects and milestones are defined. Over the
course of the project, the actual time and expenses are
compared with plan figures, theremainingexpensesare
calculated and compliance with the defined schedule
is documented. Additional monthly or weekly assess-
ments of work still to be completed are used to
calculate the level of completion of the project under-
way. By comparing the level of completion and the
remaining expenses, any potential budget deviati-
ons can be identified at an early stage. Projects that
are likely to exceed the budget are given “overspend”
status and are then added to the agenda of subsequent

57


--- Page 38 ---

58

adesso Group

Annual Report 2013

Executive Board meetings. Aside from acknowled-
ging the risk, the Executive Board meeting also
discusses potential strategies to improve the situation
by analysing the reasons for the overspending. How-
ever, the share of projects with fixed budgets in the
form of service contracts in terms of overall adesso
sales is low at under 20 %. In spite of this, the negative
effects of budget overspends in fixed-price projects
over the past few years have risen. In order to coun-
teract this trend, adesso AG has established a Project
Management Office (PMO) where experts supervise
particularly large-scale or challenging projects using
standardised tools and mechanisms alongside the
regular project management team. These tools and
processes were further developed in 2013 and are
now used routinely. Expenses arising from budget
overspends for new fixed-price projects fell notably
compared to the previous year.

Risks from a Shortfall in Planned Sales

In the event ofa high gross margin anda large share of
fixed costs, low sales canbe directly reflected inadesso’s
results. Sales improved year on year in 2013, thereby
clearly exceeding planned sales. General expecta-
tions in terms of economic development in 2014 are
cautiously optimistic and foresee rising growth
momentum. It is therefore easier to assess demand
compared to the previous year. This risk factor is esti-
mated to be less relevant than in 2013. In IT Services,
capacity utilisation is expected to be average in 2014.
However, a decline in order intake or the termination
ofimportant ongoing customer orders could result in
idle periods with corresponding implications for the
profit and financial situation within a short period
of time. Given that the IT Services business area in
particular generates business over specific periods of
time, such idle periods are difficult to compensate
for. Given that this risk factor is highly relevant to the
company, adesso monitors the following values ona
monthly, and sometimes biweekly basis in order to
identify trends at an early stage and take correspon-
ding action: order backlog, order intake, number of
hours invoiced and capacity utilisation rates, number
of employees not working at full capacity.

The IT Solutions segment pursues a product strategy.
In this segment, even standard solutions developed
by adesso are sold and implemented through licen-
sing with maintenance contracts. While the establis-
hed base of maintenance contracts represents a relati-
vely stable basis for sales, the achievement of targets

and the results of product companies are reliant on
order intake and much more volatile than the service
business, given the low number of new licences sold.
Sales revenues from maintenance activities do not
cover total ongoing costs at any of the adesso Group
companies. As a result, the product companies’
licence sales and related sales pipelines are monito-
red in detail in terms of structure and development
over time. The plan deviation risk will fall slightly in
IT Solutions in 2014 thanks to the sales pipelines
established in the markets in which it operates as part
of the internationalisation process.

In each business area, there are detailed plans in
which actual figures and previous year’s figures are
compared on a monthly basis. A revised forecast con-
tinues to be produced periodically detailing emerging
plan deviations at an early stage. The corresponding
reports form the foundations for monthly meetings
on business development and business prospects.
This applies to all companies of adesso Group.

Financial Risks

The risks posed by the financial situation and liqui-
dity have decreased. As a result of repayment of
acquisition loans amounting to EUR 2.4 million,
bank borrowing has fallen to EUR 4.6 million. These
repayments must be made, even in the absence of
business success. However, liquid assets far exceed
loan liabilities meaning that the complete repayment
of loans using cash reserves remains a possibility.

Currency risks remain low for adesso, butshow arising
trend compared to the previous year. Only a small
proportion of sales are conducted in a currency other
than the euro. These transactions mainly concern
adesso Schweiz AG and e-Spirit Schweiz AG, which
conduct business in Swiss francs, adesso Turkey,
which operates in Turkish lira, e-Spirit UK Ltd.,
which conducts business in British pounds and
e-Sprit Inc., which operates in US dollars. These com-
panies process the majority of their business in the
respective national currency. No currency hedging
transactions were carried out.

adesso AG’s loss carry-forwards for trade tax and
corporation tax purposes as of 31 December 2006
continued to be utilised in relation to BOV AG in con-
sideration of minimum taxation following the fusion
ofadesso AG (old). However, the possibility cannotbe
ruled out that financial administration at adesso AG

Forecast, Opportunities and Risk Reports

will not recognise the restructuring of business ope-
rations of BOV AG in accordance with Section 8 (4)
K6rperschaftssteuergesetz (KStG — German Corpora-
tion Tax Act) at all or to the full extent. Failure to do
so would mean that the commercial and corporate tax
loss carry-forwards ofadesso AG would be eliminated
in whole or in part. Tax expenses in adesso AG’s 2013
annual report would increase by EUR 902 thousand
without the utilisation of loss carry-forwards and,
since the loss carry-forwards have been utilised, by
a total of EUR 6,668 thousand. In the event that the
fiscal authorities do not recognise this tax benefit,
this amount would have to be reported in the income
statement and paid out less interest on arrears of
EUR 730 thousand (calculated as of 31 December
2013). In addition, the deferred tax assets on loss
carry-forwards previously offset against deferred tax
liabilities of EUR 4,809 thousand would have to be
recognised asa liability, which would have substantial
negative implications for adesso AG’s asset, financial
and profit situation.

evu.it GmbH’s loss carry-forwards existing for trade
tax and corporation tax purposes as of its acquisi-
tion (April 2010, under the name percision servi-
ces GmbH as at reporting date) have been utilised.
However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that
evu.it’s financial administration will not recognise
the restructuring of business operations in accor-
dance with Section 8c (1) Sentences 6-9 German
Corporation Tax Act (KStG) atall or to the full extent.
Non-recognition would mean that the companies’
loss carry-forwards existing for trade tax and corpora-
tion tax purposes as of the acquisition would expire
either in part or in full. Tax expenses in percision
services GmbH’s 2013 annual report would increase
by EUR 59 thousand without the utilisation of loss
carry-forwards and, since the loss carry-forwards
have been utilised, by a total of EUR 301 thousand.

There were no notable risks from financial
instruments.

Personnel Risks

adesso is an IT company without any notable fixed
assets. The company’s most important assets are its
employees. Asa result, adesso constantly monitorsand
assesses a number of key performance indicators such
as headcount, number of unproductive employees,
number of employees on sick leave, employee,
costs /sales per employee and capacity utilisation.
The top-level management is always informed about

every dismissal and new recruit. The Executive Board
regularly analyses trends and discussed measures
in its meetings. This allows any potential loss of
knowledge and expertise to be identified promptly.
Inthe product segments, essential knowledge is con-
centrated around a small group of key developers.
These developers are a particular focus of human
resources activities.

The search for suitable, experienced employees
remains characterised by a demand surplus from
companies. However, the situation has not deteriora-
ted compared to the previous year. By contrast, the
resulting entry-level salary expectations expressed
by new recruits as well as existing employees’ expec-
tations regarding pay rises are not always able to be
compensated through a corresponding adjustment
of market prices, meaning that the operating margin
can be negatively impacted as a result. adesso rein-
forces its position as a premium IT service provider
through extraordinarily talented employees with a
vast amount of experience in their fields. Competitors
in this area continue to increase their headcounts —
not simply IT service providers, but also between
user companies and the IT industry. A small number
of employees are responsible for adesso’s outstan-
ding position in its core industries. The simultaneous
departure of more than one of these employees would
expose the company to medium-term risks in terms
of its further development. Such risks are combated
through active recruiting, strategies to intensify
employee loyalty and excellent career prospects in a
prospering company.

Employee turnover remained at a stable level in line
with the average for the industry in 2013. The risk
of the lack of availability of experienced employees
as well as the risk from high employee turnover and
salaries increasing disproportionately to market
prices, were assessed as being constant. Asa result,
personnel risk remains one of the group’s main risks.

Other Relevant Risks
Risks from Business Activities in other Legal Systems
adesso Group continues to expand internationally

and enter new legal systems. This involves risks rela-
ting to lacking knowledge of legal affairs and business
practices. In 2012, e-Spirit AG established a company
based in the USA, e-Spirit Inc. with offices in Boston,
and expanded the number of employees and the sales
activities in 2013. In the USA, the risk of product

59

adesso Group

Annual Report 2013

manufacturers taking legal action is greater than it
is in Germany. The German management team has
little experience in dealing with American customers.
e-Spirit Inc. has an insurance policy with the maxi-
mum amount of liability that it could be granted. In
terms of both the legal structure of the company as
well as internal cost allocation, it has been ensured
that the potential for any problems to spread across
to e-Spirit AG is as low as possible. The company
established adesso Turkey in Istanbul, which has
begun operations. In view of the expected increase in
operations in the USA and Turkey, this risk is likely to
increase, although itis currently still classed as other
relevant risks.

Risks from the Customer Structure

As sales from individual customers or customer groups
increase, so does the risk posed by such customer
relationships from potential project terminations or
normal project expiry. In 2013, the largest customer
accounted for 8 % (previous year: 9 %) of total sales.
A total of 40 % of overall sales were generated from
adesso’s 10 largest customers (previous year: 39 %).
Risks from the customer structure have been falling
due to adesso’s growth, but have risen again above-a-
verage since the successful expansion of business with
key customers in large account management, leading
to another increase in the sales share of the top 10
customers. Due to approaching completion of a pro-
ject at one of the top 10 customers, a EUR S million
dip in sales is foreseeable. The risk is estimated to be
higher than the previous year, butremains under other
relevant risks at this level, as the share was up to 10
percentage points higher in the past. However, the
abrupt loss of another of the group’s 10 largest custo-
mers would have the potential to negatively impact the
earnings and financial situation of the company subs-
tantially, at least in the short term. The relationship to
each of these top customers is managed by a member
of the Executive Board or by the management of the
respective subsidiary in order to recognise potential
risks promptly and take appropriate action.

Each quarter, the top 10 customers are listed by sales
and each customer’s share of overall sales is calculated.
This avoids a concentration on a small number of
customer relationships and therefore allows a cluster
tisk to be recognised promptly.

Declining or Insufficiently Increasing Daily Rates
A major share of sales is generated through service
agreements and the charging of hours or days of

service provided to the customer. With rising salaries
and prices providing the basis for other costs, increases
in nominal hourly and daily rates are essential in order
to maintain the earnings margin and ultimately the
existence of the company. However, one must diffe-
rentiate between a change in the daily rate fora certain
activity for a certain customer and a change in average
daily rates resulting from a different combination of
orders or changes in the customer structure.

Atadesso AG, the volumes and daily rates are recor-
ded for all service agreements and analysed in terms
of development. The volume-weighted average daily
rate of the contract is thus calculated on a monthly,
quarterly and annual basis and reflected in the histo-
rical development. This does not include orders based
on framework agreements or public tenders, which
implies that the figures are suitable for general state-
ments only. The daily rate of the orders thus recorded
declined 2 % in 2013 from 2012, leading to a subse-
quent rise in the risk of realised average daily rates.

The realised daily rates are also periodically recorded
at adesso AG at customer level and analysed by the
Executive Board in terms of necessary adjustments.
Any identified need for action will be implemented
by sales wherever possible, which has the relevant
elements in the target-based system. Realised increa-
ses of daily rates are recorded for each customer and
a price history is maintained. Among existing custo-
mers, the company was able to increase the daily
rates moderately by 2 % to 3 %, although it was not
always able to achieve price increases with its main
customers. The risk of insufficiently rising daily rates
compared to salary increases and prices on the cost side
therefore remains, but has not increased compared
to the previous year.

Risks from the Development of New Products and
Solutions

In 2012, adesso Group significantly increased its
investment in the development of new products and
solutions and therefore shifted the risk profile of its
service-oriented business model more towards its
product business. The volume of investment was
substantial in relation to the consolidated income
statement and, as a result, was included as one of the
main risks in 2012. Development of dynamic.suite,
the company’s single most important development,
was stopped in mid 2012; investments made thus
farhave been lost. While this underscores the relevance

Forecast, Opportunities and Risk Reports

of this risk, it has declined due to a reduction in
investments in 2013 and ongoing investment in
in-house products and solutions and has been reas-
signed to the other relevant risk category.

Risks from Regulatory Law

Asa listed company on the regulated market, adesso
AG is subject to a number of additional legal requi-
rements and obligations, such as the Aktiengesetz
(AktG - German Stock Corporation Act), the Wert-
papierhandelsgesetz (WpHG — German Securities
Trading Act) and the Wertpapieriibernahmegesetz
(WpUG - German Securities Acquisition and Take-
over Act). adesso follows corresponding develop-
ments in case law, obtains assessments from expe-
rience solicitors and familiarises its entire workforce

ments in case law, obtains assessments from expe-

In September 2012, the Federal Financial Super-
visory Authority (BaFin — Bundesanstalt fiir Finanz-
dienstleistungsaufsicht) began a review into the
suspicion of the late publication of insider informa-
tion contrary to Section 15 (1) Sentence 1 WpHG and
filed charges on three counts relating to communi-
cation in 2011. According to the Ordnungswidrig-
keitengesetz (OWiG — German Act on Regulatory
Offences), a maximum penalty of up to EUR 1 million
is possible. adesso has issued a full statement on the
allegations and contradicted BaFin’s version of events
through its legal representative. To date there has
been no response from BaFin.

Overall Statement Concerning the Group’s Risk
Situation

The overall risk profile of adesso is practically un-
changed year-on-year. The evaluated risk fact
increased 13 points to 506 points. The introduction
of the risk factor “daily rate risk” (price risk), has led
to an additional 15 points to the risk factor, meaning
that based on the previously considered risks, a slight
decline of 2 points or less than 1 % was registered.
Risks from business activities in other legal systems,
liquidity risks from large projects and general projects
risks are rated higher. Risks from negative budget
deviations, from the development of new products
and solutions and from the utilisation of loss carry-

forwards are estimated to be lower. None of the iden-
tified risks can be considered at the current point
in time as risks that endanger the existence of the
company as a going concern. However, the risks
detailed above could have a negative impact on the
asset, financial and earnings situation as well as on
business performance.

Opportunities

adesso has introduced a series of measures to identify,
assess and monitor opportunities for positive group
development. Alongside sales information systems,
these measures are focused on organisational units
for portfolio development within the industry, on the
assessment of new technological developments and
on the evaluation of the suitability of other industries.
With the group further increasing in size, the syste-
matic networking of all units within adesso Group is
leading to ever-increasing synergy effects, particularly
in sales, and an integrated service approach for major
customers.

In 2014, there will be a wide range of further oppor-
tunities to expand business activities and increase
profits. adesso’s drebis platform was expanded to
include vehicle damage claims in the automotive sector.
Marketing activities for the PSLife system in the life
insurance industry will be stepped up in 2014. In
2014, adesso’s portfolio will be expanded to include
Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). Unlike the rest of
the business model, software will not be developed for
customers in order to support their business processes.
Instead adesso will develop the software for itself,
employ people for processing, thereby carrying out
a part of the customer’s business processes. This is
only possible for IT service providers with extensive
sector expertise and requires a certain company size
and reputation. All this poses market entry barriers to
adesso’s potential competitors. The use of internally
developed and constantly optimised software for seve-
ral customers means adesso can generate increasingly
higher margins from Business Process Outsourcing.
The foundation for this business will be laid in 2014
with Heuristic Claims Management, where adesso will
assume part of the claims management processes of a
legal protection insurer and develop self-learning soft-
ware with integrated image recognition functions. The
restructuring of the energy industry has potential to
increase profits in comparison with the previous year.

INTERNAL CONTROL
SYSTEM AND RISK
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
IN TERMS OF THE CON-
SOLIDATED ACCOUNTING
PROCESS

In the accounting process, there is a risk that the
financial reports based on the accounts could contain
misrepresentations of facts that could have a signi-
ficant influence on decisions made by the intended
recipients of the reports. These can include the mis-
allocation ofresourcesand non-performance of certain
measures by the managementin terms of the internal
operative management of the company and its
subsidiaries, as well as misinterpretation on the part
of report recipients, and particularly existing and
potential shareholders. The processes and systems
established at adesso are geared toward identifying
potential sources of errors in the accounting process
and thus limiting the resulting risks; they are intended
to ensure that the annual report and consolidated
financial statement are prepared in accordance with
legal requirements. The report is standardised and
identical in form for both the management report of
the annual financial statementas well as for the group
management report of adesso AG.

At adesso, no control and risk management system
was defined and documented especially for the
purposes of theaccounting process. Thereisnointernal
auditing structure or risk committee. No external
advisors or auditors were engaged to review the
efficiency of the controls in place as part of the
consolidated accounting process. The structure of
the internal control mechanisms and risk manage-
ment system is the result of how the accounting and
reporting processes are organised. The majority of
the accounting is carried out decentrally by each of
the companies within adesso Group. As the parent
company, adesso AG performs accounting services

for some adesso Group companies together with
centralised administrative processes such as payroll
accounting. These companies’ accounts are primarily
kept on the same accounting system as clients.
The fact that the same people are responsible for this
process throughout the group and that the adesso
AG CFO has ongoing, direct access to the reporting
and accounting processes provides an outstanding
basis for the standardised, correct representation of
facts. Almost all companies use a standardised con-
solidated accounts system, minimising the number
of discrepancies from the standard style of accounts.
The detailed coverage of group accounts means that
it is simple to coordinate internal group perfor-
mance processes. The respective management teams
are responsible for individual financial statements.
Each financial statement that forms part of the con-
solidated financial statement is reviewed by the group
auditor in terms of its plausibility and compliance
with group standards, irrespective of any audits per-
formed by the local auditor or tax consultant. For this
purpose, the auditor of the consolidated financial
statement visits the respective local auditor and
inspects the documentation of key group companies.

All individual financial statements are submitted to
a centralised consolidation system in adesso AG’s
Finance department and consolidated into the con-
solidated financial statement in accordance with the
IFRS reconciliation statement. The software solu-
tion specially procured for this purpose was audited
and certified in accordance with the “Erteilung und
Verwendung von Softwarebescheinigungen” auditing
standards (“Issuance and Use of Software Certifi-
cates”) published by the Institut der Wirtschaft-
priifer in Deutschland e.V. (IDW PS 880). All IFRS
reconciliation and consolidation processes are fully
documented and traceable.

The core elements of the control and risk manage-
ment system when it comes to accounting is the
monthly, standardised reporting of full monthly

REMUNERATION
REPORT

Principles of the Remuneration System

At adesso, variable remuneration systems are in
place through-out the group for a variety of func-
tions. Management remuneration is primarily geared
toward the success of the company and industry
standards. The adesso AG Executive Board receives

performance-related remuneration depending on
the medium- and long-term achievement of sales
and operating result targets at both an adesso AG
level and a group level. Part of the Executive Board’s
variable remuneration is share-based in the form of
stock options and virtual stock options, and phantom
shares granted to some members. The Executive
Board participated in the company-wide stock option
scheme open to many employees and which expired
at the end of 2013. This was replaced, subject to an
outstanding resolution of the Supervisory Board, by
a model of virtual stock options for the Executive
Board. In accordance with Article 11 of the Articles of
Association, the members of the Supervisory Board
receive an annual salary plus expenses which consists
ofa fixed component of EUR 5 thousand (the Chair-
person receives 1.5 times this amount) anda variable
component of 0.0275 %o of the company’s balance
sheet profitless 4 % of the paid-in contributions to the
share capital. Further variable remuneration systems
are in place at various levels of the corporate hier-
archy. These are predominantly pegged to the volume
of services invoiced to customers, profit contribu-
tions from business units or order intake in sales.

Executive Board Remuneration

Basic remuneration is paid as a monthly salary and
is performance related. Annual salary increases of
1% p.a. are contractually established for Michael
Kenfenheuer and Dr. Riidiger Striemer. Negotiations
for salary adjustments are conducted when inflation
exceeds 3 %. The salary increase for Christoph Junge
is 3% p.a., and does not apply in the years when the
Executive Board of adesso AG passes a resolution
to suspend general salary increases for employees.
All members of the Executive Board also receive
payments in kind and other remuneration, including
the use of a company car, the reimbursement of
travelexpenses, coverage of directinsurancepremiums,
a personal pension and reimbursement of half the
documented premiums for voluntary health and
nursing care insurance.

Variable, Performance-based Remuneration

The bonus depends exclusively on the profit gene-
rated by adesso in the respective year. Here, profit is
defined as net income for the year before income taxes
and amortisation of goodwill for the adesso Group
according to the respective national laws, without
taking into account variable remuneration and
profit sharing for members of the Executive Board.

Remuneration Report

The sum of earnings generated by group companies
relevant for Executive Board targets is used, adjusted
for items that do not conform with targets where
applicable. Profit sharing is calculated on a linear basis
at 0 to 25 % of basic remuneration, depending on pro-
fitability. In combination with variable remuneration
for the respective year, profit sharing is not permit-
ted to exceed one-fifth of the total profit for adesso.

The “variable remuneration component 1” is paid out
depending on the degree to which the annual sales
and profit targets are met. If the profit target is not
reached or the sales target is not achieved to at least
80%, no variable remuneration is paid. Ifboth targets
are achieved to at least 80 %, variable remuneration is
determined according to the following rules. For each
percentage point above the minimum target achieve-
ment of 80%, in reference to profit defined as net
income for the year before income taxes and amor-
tisation of goodwill for the adesso Group according
to the respective national laws, and without taking
into account variable remuneration and profit sharing
for members of the Executive Board, each member of
the Executive Board receives EUR 750 as the variable
remuneration component 1 limited to a maximum.
target achievement of 130 % or a maximum amount
of EUR 37,500. The sum of earnings generated by

group companies relevant for Executive Board targets,
adjusted for items that do not conform with targets
where applicable, is used to calculate profit sharing.

The “variable remuneration component 2” is paid
out depending on the degree to which targets are
achieved within the past four years and the current
year. This takes into account the objective of having
a medium to long-term component of Executive
Board remuneration. The variable remuneration
component 2 is calculated as the average of the varia-
ble remuneration component 1 for the year under
review and the second-lowest for the past four years.
In combination with variable remuneration for the
respective year, profit sharing is not permitted to
exceed one-fifth of the total profit for adesso.

Performance-based variable remuneration is paid out
in the following year. The table below shows the short-
term remuneration of the Executive Board for 2013:

In the course of negotiating the Executive Board
contracts in effect from 1 January 2012, board mem-
bers Michael Kenfenheuer and Dr. Riidiger Striemer
were granted a one-time amount of EUR 25 thousand
each in 2011, which is to be paid out in 2012.

Long-term Remuneration

A phantom share programme for certain members
of the Executive Board and employees at the first
management level of adesso AG was approved by
the Supervisory Board in financial year 2009. It was
intended to help bind managers to the company in the
long term. The phantom shares participate in divi-
dends just like actual shares but the payments are
included in salaries. After being with the company for
a term of five to eight years, the holders of phantom
shares have aright to receive the value represented at
the time by the number of phantom shares and the
underlying share price. Payment is included in sala-
ries. 57,145 phantom shares were granted to board
member Michael Kenfenheuer on 1 September 2010.
57,145 phantom shares were granted to board mem-
ber Dr. Riidiger Striemer on 1 September 2009. In
2013, the two board members Michael Kenfenheuer
and Dr. Riidiger Striemer obtained additional rights
from these phantom shares. A provision of EUR 203
thousand (previous year: EUR 89 thousand) was
established through profit or loss in the reporting
period for the repurchase value of the phantom shares
held by the board members, and reported as a long-
term incentive component.

In case a board member leaves the Executive Board,
the following has been established in regards to the
phantom share programme: Ifa board member leaves
before the end of three years from the start of the

programme due to termination of contract, the
board member only has to return the shares in ex-
change for compensation in case ofa change of control.
This is the case if the shareholders Rainer Rudolf and
Prof. Dr. Volker Gruhn (or companies through which
they hold their shares) hold less than 35 % of the com-
pany’s total capital through the sum of their shares.
Ifa board member leaves after the end of at least three
years, due to termination of contract or if the com-
pany fails to make a contract renewal offer at terms and
conditions at least equivalent to those of the current
contract, the board member has to return the shares.
Compensation is 75 % of the applicable value. If a
board member leaves after the end of at least eight
years, the shares have to be returned in exchange for
compensation.

The stock option programme of adesso AG duly
expired on 31 December 2013. In view of the gran-
ted stock options, the Executive Board, subject to
approval by the Supervisory Board, will receive
virtual stock options for the financial year 2013 in
2014. The aim of the virtual stock options is that
they are financially equal to option rights when
post-tax income is used for subscribing the virtual
stock options in order to buy adesso AG shares on
the market. The same conditions apply to virtual
stock options as for stock options granted by the pro-
gramme expiring on 31 December 2013. The num-
ber of virtual stock options issued to the Executive

Board depends on the variable performance-based
remuneration component, which means it is also
performance-based. The virtual stock options only
result in cash value compensation if the exercise cri-
teria are met after the end of the minimum holding
period. 140 virtual stock options are granted for each
EUR 1,000 paid as the performance-based variable
remuneration component 1 fora year. The virtual
stock options remain valid even if a board member
leaves before subscribing the virtual stock options.
Michael Kenfenheuer exercised stock options in
2013. Michael Kenfenheuer acquired 4,000 shares
from the conversion. The members of the Executive
Board received 2,020 new stock options each for
financial year 2013.

In the 2013 calendar year, remuneration for all
Executive Board members of adesso AG appoin-
ted in this period totalled EUR 811 thousand (pre-
vious year: EUR 960 million) plus “dividends”
under the phantom share programme at EUR 21
thousand (previous year: EUR 21 thousand). Former
members of the Executive Board do not receive any
remuneration, nor were any pension commitments
made. No loans or advances were granted to members
of the Executive Board.

Supervisory Board Remuneration

According to Section 11 of the bylaws, the members
of the Supervisory Board are reimbursed for their
expenses and also receive annual remuneration. This
consists ofa fixed component of EUR 5 thousand plus
variable remuneration at 0.275 %o of the company’s
balance sheet profit, reduced by 4% of contributions
to share capital. The chairman receives one anda half
times this remuneration. Supervisory Board members
who have not held their position for a full financial
year receive remuneration according to their term
in office. The chairperson of the Supervisory Board
receives additional remuneration under a consulting
and brokerage agreement.

Total remuneration in the 2013 calendar year for all
members of the adesso AG Supervisory Board appoin-
ted in this period was EUR 28.0 thousand (previous
year: EUR 17.5 thousand) for Supervisory Board
activities. Commissions, fees and the reimburse-
ment of expenses totalled EUR 241 thousand (pre-
vious year: EUR 281 thousand). Former members of
the Supervisory Board do not receive any remune-
ration, nor were any pension commitments made.

adesso AG has neither granted loans or advances to
members of the Supervisory Board nor issued bonds
or guarantees on their behalf. There are no family
ties between members of the Supervisory Board,
nor between members of the Supervisory Board and
the Executive Board. There are no service agreements
between the Supervisory Board members and adesso
or its subsidiaries that call for remuneration upon
termination.
