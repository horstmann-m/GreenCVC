Directors’ report

The Board and CEO of BillerudKorsnas AB (publ), corporate identity number

556025-5001, herewith submit the annual report and the consolidated annual

accounts for the 2016 financial year. Figures for the previous year are stated in
brackets, 2016 (2015). This English version is a translation of the Swedish original.

BillerudKorsnas’ EBITDA (gross margin) and operating profit
declined in 2016, by SEK 397 million and SEK 541 million or 10%
and 21% compared with 2015. The decline was principally due
to expenses at the end of the year resulting from the decision to
invest in anew board machine in Gruvon and the fact that the
profit for 2015 contains a capital gain from sale of the pellet busi-
ness in Latvia (SIA Latgran).

Market

BillerudKorsnas offers the global packaging market innovative
and sustainable products and services. The Group has a leading
position in primary fibre-based packaging paper and carton-
board. The packaging market is showing continued positive
long-term development, primarily as a result of greater globali-
sation through increased world trade, urbanisation, digitisation
and greater awareness of sustainability. In addition to packaging
materials, BillerudKorsnas sells surplus long-fibre pulp, Northern
Bleached Softwood Kraft (NBSK), which is not used in its own
production. BillerudKorsnas’ base is in Europe, but we are con-
tinuing to become established in other markets, including in Asia.

During 2016 operations were divided into the three business areas:
Packaging Paper, Consumer Board and Corrugated Solutions.

Packaging Paper offers kraft and sack paper of premium quality
plus smart solutions for customers with exacting demands in
the industrial, medical equipment and consumer sectors. The
business area also sells any surplus of pulp that BillerudKorsnas
does not use in its own production.

Consumer Board delivers packaging materials in high-quality
board made from primary fibre for beverages, food products
and various other consumer goods.

Corrugated Solutions supplies materials to corrugated board
manufacturers and packaging solutions to brand owners.
Strong and light materials, fluting and liner, are used in corru-
gated boxes for fragile goods and demanding distribution sys-
tems. Supply chain solutions for packaging optimisation are a
key component of the offering.

Group net sales for the whole year decreased by 1% compared
with the previous year due to the disposal of Latgran and lower
average prices, principally for fluting and pulp. Sales to North

BILLERUDKORSNAS ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

and South America and Africa developed positively. Around
29% of combined sales volume in 2016 took place outside
Europe, representing a small rise compared with 2015. The
trend in sales was slightly offset by a more favourable exchange
rate.

Sales volumes increased by 1% to a record level of
2772 ktonnes.

Net sales in Corrugated Solutions increased in the comparison
with the previous year due to increased production of fluting
with the previous year’s rebuild of PM6 in Gruvén and continued
healthy growth for Managed Packaging. The addition of several
new programmes and an increase in orders at the end of the
year led to sales for December being the highest ever recorded
in Managed Packaging. Consumer Board reported sales in

line with the previous year, after disruptions of production and
assets had led to an inability to fully satisfy our key customers’
delivery requests. Sales of Packaging Paper fell, principally due
to pulp prices and closure of Tervasaari.

Financial targets

To support BillerudKorsnas’ target for profitable growth and
return for shareholders, the following financial targets have been
introduced from 2016.

+ Long-term target for organic growth of
3-4% per year.

+ The EBITDA margin should exceed 17%. This target replaces
previous operating margin targets.

+ Return on capital employed (ROCE) should exceed 13%.

+ Interest-bearing net debt in relation to EBITDA should be less
than a multiple of 2.5. This target replaces previous targets for
the net debt/equity ratio.

* The dividend policy is unchanged — the dividend should be
50% of net profit.

In recent years, BillerudKorsnas has shown stable underlying
earnings, despite market conditions varying between business
areas. As a result of this, the aim is to achieve the financial tar-
gets irrespective of the economic cycle.

BillerudKorsnas’ long-term financial targets up to December

2015 were:

* Over an economic cycle, the operating margin should exceed
10%.

* Over an economic cycle, the return on capital employed
should exceed 13%.

* The net debt/equity ratio should be less than 0.9.

* Over an economic cycle, the dividend should average 50% of
net profit.

Sales and earnings
Net sales totalled SEK 21 657 million, a decrease of 1% due to
the disvestiture of the pellet business in Latvia (SIA Latgran).

EBITDA decreased to SEK 3 606 million (4 003) and operating
profit decreased to SEK 2 045 million (2 586), principally due to
expenses of SEK 205 million at the end of the year resulting from
the decision to invest in a new board machine (KM/7) in Gruvon and
the fact that the 2015 result contains a capital gain of SEK 440 mil-
lion from sale of SIA Latgran. This also meant a decrease in gross
margin (EBITDA, %), which was 17% (18). Operating profit was
also affected negatively by an impairment write-down of SEK 120

64

million related to plant and equipment in Gruv6n due to the decis-
tion to invest in KM7. The operating margin was 9% (12). See note 6
for more information regarding items affecting comparability.

Net financial items totalled SEK -108 million (-175). Profit before
tax was SEK 1 937 million (2 411) and estimated tax was SEK
-419 million (-443). Net profit totalled SEK 1 518 million (1 968).

Return on equity for the period was 12% (16) and return on cap-
ital employed was 12% (15). A dividend of SEK 4.30 per share is
proposed (4.25).

Profit trend

EBITDA increased by SEK 30 million to SEK 1 486 million, and
operating profit increased by SEK 19 million compared with

2015 to SEK 990 million, which represent an increase of 2%. The
increase was principally due to a more favourable exchange

rate and product mix. Sales volumes were at the same level as
the previous year. Prices for packaging paper in local currency
were stable during the year and increased somewhat during the
fourth quarter. Prices in local currency for market pulp were stable
throughout the year.

Market development

Order levels for both sack and kraft paper were normal for most
of the year. Orders received increased during the last quarter of
the year in comparison with previous years.

The market for NBSK pulp was stable during the year. Prices in
Europe increased to approximately USD 810 per tonne at year-
end, compared with approximately USD 800 per tonne at the
beginning of the year.

Key events in 2016

Investment programme for growth and efficiency

A decision to continue investment in Skarblacka was made in
2016, with the aim of making Skarblacka a world-leading centre
for manufacturing machine glazed kraft paper (MG paper). The
investment will see the paper machine in Tervasaari in Finland
move to Skarblacka in 2017. The Tervasaari machine is one of
the largest MG paper machines in the world. In Skarblacka, it will

BILLERUDKORSNAS ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

be fully integrated with pulp production, which will give ita very
competitive position in the market for white MG paper. Surface
treatment capacity on Skarblacka PM7 will enable additional
functionality that can be used in the areas of food packaging,
medical packaging and release liners.

Introduction to Axello ZAP

BillerudKorsnas introduced a new packaging concept during the
year- a renewable, recyclable, dust-tight and insect-proof paper
packaging for dry foods. The concept has been developed
together with Bosch Packaging Technology (Bosch). The pack-
aging is made from a specially developed paper, Axello ZAP,
which is the only paper that is adapted to run in Vertical Form, Fill
and Seal (VFFS) with the Bosch PME ZAP module.

New life cycle analysis

BillerudKorsnas commissioned IVL Swedish Environmental
Research Institute to compare a paper bag made of new fibre
from BillerudKorsnas with carrier bags based on recycled paper,
recycled plastic and bioplastic. The outcome of the analysis was
that a recycled plastic bag has twice the carbon footprint of a
BillerudKorsnas paper bag.

Consumer Board

Consumer Board supplies packaging materials consisting of
high-quality liquid board and packaging board made from pri-
mary fibre for beverages, food products and various other con-
sumer goods. Smart solutions in terms of function, design and
material selection create added value for customers. Europe is
the largest market.

Profit trend

Thanks to a favourable exchange rate and a change in product
mix, net sales are unchanged compared with the same period
last year, despite a fall in volume of sales of nearly 1%. Sales vol-
umes fell as a result of disruptions to production in Frévi during
the fourth quarter of 2015 and the start of 2016, which led toa
decline in stock available for delivery.

65


--- Page 4 ---

EBITDA increased by SEK 66 million and operating profit by SEK
10 million, which represent an increase of 4% and 1% in compar-
ison with 2015, principally due to lower variable costs and more
stable cartonboard production.

Market development

Orders received for liquid and packaging board were stable and
satisfactory during the year, with normal seasonal variations.
Prices in local currency were unchanged compared to previous
year.

Key events in 2016

Major investment in Gruvén

A decision made at the end of 2016 on an investment programme
totalling SEK 5.7 billion to meet the increasing demand for liquid
packaging board and cartonboard. The investment will result

in the construction of a new board machine at the Gruvon pro-
duction plant and in rebuilds at existing pulp mills. The board
machine will have an annual capacity of 550 000 tonnes of board,
making it one of the largest of its type in the world. The machine
will produce liquid packaging board, cartonboard, food service
board and liner. The investment project will start immediately and
production is expected to start in the first quarter of 2019.

Full-scale test to add MFC to board production

BillerudKorsnas decided to go ahead with full-scale tests to add
microfibrillar cellulose (MFC) to its board products. After small-
scale tests were performed in 2016, full-scale tests will now be
conducted starting in 2017. The full-scale tests are being carried
out in cooperation with the Norwegian company Borregaard.

Launch of BillerudKorsnas White in the United States
BillerudKorsnas White, a cartonboard based on primary fibre,
was launched during the year. The surface of the cartonboard
has been developed to allow sophisticated printing, something
that is often in demand among premium sector brands in areas
such as beverages, chocolates and confectionery.

Corrugated Solutions

Corrugated Solutions supplies materials to corrugated board
manufacturers and packaging solutions to brand owners.
Strong and light materials, fluting and liner, are used in corru-
gated boxes for fragile goods and demanding distribution sys-
tems. Smart packaging is delivered via the Managed Packaging
concept, which provides supply chain solutions and packaging
optimisations, with a view to challenging conventional solutions.

The name change as of 1 January 2016 from Containerboard to
Corrugated Solutions reflects the organisational and strategic
changes being made in this business area in order to fully inte-
grate the business model for sales of solutions and increase the
proportion of sales to brand owners around the world.

Profit trend

Net sales increased by 9% as a result of increased volume for
fluting and growth for Managed Packing. 2015 was affected by
lower fluting volumes during the rebuild of Gruvén PM6.

EBITDA increased by SEK 105 million, and operating profit rose
by SEK 96 million compared with the previous year, correspond-
ing to an increase of 15% and 17% respectively. The improve-
mentis principally due to increased volumes, lower delivery
costs and lower variable costs.

Market development

Market position and orders for fluting were fairly strong during

the year, despite pressure on prices. The order situation for liner
developed favourably, driven by high demand. Managed Packag-
ing continued to grow and generate new business during the year.

Key events in 2016

A year of consolidation for vigorous new efforts.

During the year, the business area focused on implementing
the organisation established in 2015. Intensive work took place
in fluting and liner to ensure that investments made previously
in the production units result in the desired capacity, so that the
investments create growth and value. The new organisation and
the reinforcements in production provide a solid foundation for
continued investments and initiatives.

Optimal packaging solutions for brand owners.

BillerudKorsnas Managed Packaging, whose business model is
based on integrated solutions, continuously analyses opportuni-
ties to optimise packaging for various sectors. This operation was
extended to more segments during the year. An example for 2016
includes the development of a complete packaging portfolio in cor-
rugated board for an American grill equipment company. Billerud-
Korsnas designed completely new packaging for the customer,
optimised for each product. As the customer had previously used

BILLERUDKORSNAS ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016


--- Page 5 ---

PET packaging, the solution was not only better from the design
point of view but also reduced the customer's use of fossil materials.

Strengthened supplier control

During the year further resources were added to assess the com-
pany’s production partners in Managed Packaging, in the form of a
Regional Compliance Officer based at the office in Shenzhen, China.

Organic growth

Organic growth, which is measured as the increase in net sales
adjusted for additions and deductions with amounts corre-
sponding to the sales revenue of acquired and divested opera-
tions, was 0.3% in 2016.

Investments and capital employed

Gross investments in 2016 amounted to SEK 1 645 million (1 710).

The most important investment event in 2016 was the decision
by the Board in December to build a board machine in Gruvén.
As well as a new board machine (KM/), itincludes adaptations
of the pulp mill and the infrastructure at Gruvén to the new board
machine. Production is expected to start in the first quarter of
2019.

In June 2016, a decision was made to strengthen Skarblacka as
a world-leading kraft paper centre by upgrading one of the MG
machines with surface treatment equipment, in order to make
more advanced products, and installing a third MG machine by
moving an existing machine from Tervasaari i Finland to Skar-
blacka and consequently integrating it with pulp production.
The investment programmes in Gruvén and Skarblacka total
SEK 5 700 million and SEK 1 280 million respectively and will be
financed with both market- and bank debt.

BillerudKorsnas’ capital employed at 31 December 2016 totalled
SEK 16 906 million (17 397). Return on capital employed, calcu-
lated over the past 12-month period, was 12% (15). Return on
equity was 12% (16).

The investment level is expected to be around SEK 4 300 million
in 2017.

Working capital in the fourth quarter totalled 11% (10) in relation
to net sales. During the year, further work was undertaken to
keep the level of working capital at a long-term sustainable level
in relation to net sales.

Cash flow from operating activities in 2016 totalled SEK 3 742
million (3 658) and operating cash flow was SEK 2 101 million

(1 957). The increase is primarily attributable to increased oper-
ating surplus and reduced working capital.

Net interest-bearing debt at 31 December 2016 was SEK 3 884 mil-
lion (4 979). The ratio of Group net interest-bearing debt to EBITDA
at the end of the period was 1.08 (1.24). BillerudKorsnas’ financial
target for its net debt/EBITDA ratio is that it should be less than
2.50.

Financing

At 31 December 2016, interest-bearing loans amounted to SEK
3 829 million (4 395). Of these interest-bearing loans, bond loans
amounted to SEK 1 800 million (2 200), commercial paper pro-
grammes utilised by BillerudKorsnas (with a maximum limit of
SEK 3 000 million) SEK 0 million (349) and other interest-bearing
debt SEK 2 029 million (1 846). Of the bond loans, SEK 300 mil-
lion falls due in 2017 and SEK 1 500 million in 2018.

The syndicated credit facility with a maximum limit of SEK 5 500

Currency hedging

The currency hedging policy is to hedge 0-80% of net flows
over the next 15 months. Any deviations from the policy must be
approved by the Board of Directors.

Currency hedging had a combined earnings impact of SEK-54 mil-
lion (125) for 2016 (compared with if no hedging had taken place).

BillerudKorsnas’ outstanding foreign exchange contracts at 31
December 2016 had a market value of SEK -60 million, of which
SEK -24 million is the portion of the contracts corresponding to
accounts receivable that has affected earnings. Other contracts
had a market value of SEK -36 million.

Tax situation

BillerudKorsnas’ effective tax rate is estimated normally at
21-23%. The tax expense for 2016 was SEK 419 million, equiva-
lent to a tax rate of 21.6%. The tax expense for 2015 was SEK 443
million, equivalent to 18.4%. The low tax rate for 2015 was mainly
due to anon-taxable capital gain from the sale of SIA Latgran.

Environmental and permit issues

BillerudKorsnas has six production units in Sweden, two in Fin-
land and one in the UK that require permits under environmental
legislation. These permits apply to the production of pulp and
paper. BillerudKorsnas has all the official permits necessary to
conduct operations at the volumes produced in 2016. The envi-
ronmental impact of operations is mainly in the form of emissions
to air and water and the creation of waste and noise.

BillerudKorsnas’ Swedish production units have been awarded
emission allowances for carbon dioxide within the EU. The allocation
for the eight-year period that began in 2013 exceeds total projected
emissions.

Product and process development

The costs of product and process development, to the extent
attributable to research activities, are charged to profit in the
year that they arise. In the past year, such costs accounted for
approximately 0.7% (0.5) of BillerudKorsnas’ operating costs.

Seasonal factors
BillerudKorsnas’ business is to a relatively limited extent subject to
seasonal fluctuations. Periodical maintenance shutdowns have the

Estimated shutdown cost

Estimated distribution of shutdown cost by business area

largest impact, as each production unit stops production for around
one week. The loss of production results in somewhat lower deliver-
ies over an extended period before, during and after the shutdown.
BillerudKorsnas' costs are relatively stable throughout the year.
Fixed costs are slightly lower in the summer, however, due to fewer
maintenance projects and holidays. Energy costs are slightly higher
in the winter because of higher energy consumption and normally
higher energy prices, especially for electricity.

Maintenance shutdowns

In addition to ongoing maintenance during production, Billerud-
Korsnas’ production units normally also require more extensive
maintenance at some point during the year. In order to carry out
maintenance, production of pulp and paper is stopped. The prin-
Cipal items of cost ina maintenance shutdown are loss of volume
arising from the shutdown and fixed costs, mainly costs of mainte-
nance and overtime work, as well as a certain portion of variable
costs including higher consumption of electricity and wood when
production is restarted. The effects of shutdowns on earnings vary
depending on the extent of measures carried out, their nature and
the actual length of the shutdown. The estimated cost of shutdown
is an assessment of the impact on earnings of a normal shutdown,
compared to a quarter during which no periodic maintenance shut-
down takes place.

Other seasonal effects

Aconsiderable share of volumes for BillerudKorsnas Flute® are
used for packaging for exporting fruit from the Mediterranean
area. Demand by this group of customers varies with the fruit
export season and is usually highest in September—March.

Aconsiderable share of BillerudKorsnas’ sack paper and Quick-
Fill® sack paper goes to packaging for cement and building
materials. The demand for building materials in Europe is gener-
ally higher in May—October.

Share structure

At 31 December 2016, share capital totalled SEK 1 537 642 793,

BillerudKorsnas shares

The share capital of BillerudKorsnas AB is represented by

208 219 834 ordinary shares, of which 1 130 498 are owned by
BillerudKorsnas AB. Each share carries an entitlement to one
vote at the AGM. Transfer of shares is not restricted by law or by
the Company's articles of association.

The largest shareholder, Frapag Beteiligungsholding AG, owned
31 300 000 shares, corresponding to 15.1% of shares in the
market. No other shareholder owned 10% or more of the total
number of shares at 31 December 2016. The Company knows of
no agreements between shareholders that may restrict the right
to transfer shares. Appointment and dismissal of Board mem-
bers, and changes to the articles of association, are subject to
approval by the AGM. Agreements exist between the Company,
other Group companies and senior executives that entail com-
pensation if they were to resign, be dismissed without reason-
able grounds or if their employment were to end due to a public
bid to acquire shares in the Company. These agreements are
described in Note 26. Agreements between the Company and
other employees that regulate their own resignation or dismissal
by the Company conform with normal labour market practice.

Parent company

From 2015, the parent company BillerudKorsnas AB includes
the sales organisation for the Nordic market and markets outside
Europe, and the head office functions.

Operating profit for 2016 was SEK -27 million, compared with SEK
-185 million for 2015. The increase was principally due to the positive
effect of a hedging contract and revaluation of accounts receivable.

During the second quarter of 2016, the parent company was
exposed to an external fraud, which impacted the result neg-
atively with SEK 25 million. BillerudKorsnas has reported the
fraud to the Swedish police and also reported a claim to the
insurance company.

The parent company hedges both its own and the Group's net
currency flows. The parent company’s earnings include the
results of these hedging measures. These earnings were SEK
—54 million (-125) in 2016.

The parent company is responsible for the Group’s financing
issues, and most of the Group’s external interest-bearing debt is
raised by the parent company.

The parent company has not hedged prices for the net surplus
of paper pulp for 2017. In the previous year, the parent company
hedged prices for around one-third of the net surplus of NBSK
pulp for 2016.

The average number of employees was 100 (96).

Cash and bank balances and short-term investments amounted
to SEK 516 million (10).

Risk management in parent company

For a description of the Group’s risk management, see the ‘Risk
management and sensitivity analysis’ section. The description
applies, where appropriate, to both the Group and parent com-
pany. Specific differences concerning the parent company are
commented on under this heading.

For an understanding of the risk exposure in the parent com-
pany, the following should be taken into account.

BILLERUDKORSNAS ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

Customer credit

The parent company’s accounts receivable represent more than
80% of the Group's accounts receivable, because a large share
of the production units accounts receivable are taken over by
the parent company after invoicing and the monies are collected
by the parent company. However, the risk of any bad debt losses
remains with the invoicing company. Of total provision within the
Group for doubtful accounts receivable in 2016, SEK 0 million (0)
was attributable to the parent company.

Exchange rate exposure

All forward foreign exchange contracts for the Swedish opera-
tions are taken out by the parent company, while the exposure

to payment flows in foreign currency is borne by all the Swedish
and Finnish production units. Exposure for the parent company is
thus lower than that of the forward contracts signed. This applies
up to the invoicing date, because the parent company takes over
the accounts receivable for the Swedish and Finnish production
units. At year-end 2016, foreign exchange contracts not yet rec-
ognised in profit/loss for the parent company nominally totalled
SEK 4 562 million (2 672), of which SEK 3 635 million will be rec-
ognised in profit/loss in 2017 and SEK 927 million in 2018.

Interest rate risk

The Group's borrowing is conducted primarily via the parent
company and accounted for 86% (87%) of the Group's total bor-
rowing at 31 December 2016. As a result, the parent company
has largely the same exposure to changes in interest rates as
the Group. Interest rate derivatives are used to change fixed
interest periods in the debt portfolio. The majority of interest rate
derivatives are attributable to the parent company.

Proposed allocation of profit

As shown in Note 19, non-restricted equity in the parent com-
pany, BillerudKorsnas AB, totalled SEK 5 606 million at 31
December 2016.

BillerudKorsnas’ financial targets state that dividend is to be
50% of net profit and that the ratio of interest-bearing net debt to
EBITDA is to be less than 2.5. Group interest-bearing net debt

in relation to EBITDA at the end of 2016 was 1.08 (1.24) times.
BillerudKorsnas’ Board of Directors proposes that, of the earn-
ings per share of SEK 7.33, SEK 4.30 per share be paid to share-
holders and that the remaining amount be carried forward.

Events after the close of the financial year
See Note 29 for Events after the close of the financial year.

Outlook

Demand and order levels are expected to be stable during the
first quarter, with normal seasonal variations for all business
areas.

Average prices in local currency are expected to be unchanged
in all segments during the first quarter except for the effect of
previously notified price rises in sack paper.

Wood costs are expected to increase by around 3% in the next
quarter as a result of higher transport costs. No changes in
wood prices are, however, expected.

The investment level is expected to be around SEK 4 300 million
in 2017.
