managed: insurance activities, asset management activities, and cor-

ucts, risks, and capital allocation, insurance activities are further
divided into property-casualty and life/health categories. In accor-
dance with the responsibilities of the Board of Management, each of
the insurance categories is grouped into regional reportable seg-
ments. Corporate and other activities are divided into three different
reportable segments in order to differentiate between the respective
products, risks, and capital allocation. In 2015, the Allianz Group had
16 reportable segments.

Germany

We offer our customers in Germany a full range of insurance and
financial services through Allianz Deutschland AG. Our products are
mainly provided by Allianz Versicherungs-aG (Allianz Sach), Allianz
Lebensversicherungs-a (Allianz Leben) and Allianz Private Kranken-
versicherungs-AG (Allianz Private Kranken). They are distributed
through a broad network of distribution channels, such as agencies,
brokers and direct, with a strong focus on our tied-agents network.
Here, Allianz Beratungs- und Vertriebs-aG serves as our distribution
company.

As the market leader in the German property-casualty market,
we provide our products and services to retail and commercial cus-
tomers. For retail customers the product world of Allianz became
more digital with the launch of an online configuration tool for the
modular product “Privatschutz” on Allianz.de. For purely direct cus-
tomers the product range of AllSecur was broadened to liability and
household. In July 2015, a new modular commercial product called
“Firmenkonzept” — which is sold via tied agents — was successfully
launched. The product combines property, liability and legal protec-
tion insurance and targets small and medium-sized companies.

Our life insurance business is active in retail and commercial
markets and provides a comprehensive range of products. The main
coverage offered includes annuity, endowment, term, disability, and
long-term care insurance. In 2015, Komfort Dynamik— a new product
that combines traditional guarantees with a stronger upside potential
through a higher share of equity investment — was launched. More

than 9,000 products have been sold by year-end 2015. Overall, less
than one third of total new business in life came from traditional
products.

Through Allianz Private Kranken (APKV) we provide a wide range
of health insurance products, including full private health care cover-
age, supplementary health and long-term care insurance, as well as
foreign travel medical insurance. In 2015, we expanded our product
portfolio in comprehensive health insurance with the launch of anew
tariff (AktiMedg9oP) and an additional module for fitness-oriented
customers. Also, within the Allianz digitalization strategy, APKV
established a number of digital services and processes, such as the
photo app for claims, which enables customers to interact more
easily and efficiently in all matters of health insurance.

Italy

Our Italian insurance entity Allianz Italy has a very strong multi-
channel footprint and is the digital leader in the Italian market. We
are strongly dedicated to the agent channel, and we also offer our
products through Genialloyd — the leading company in the Italian
direct business —, the broker channel, Allianz Bank Financial Advi-
sors S.p.A., and bancassurance, with UniCredit as our main distribu-
tion partner.

In our property-casualty business, Allianz Italy again significantly
outperformed the market in terms of premium growth and profit-
ability, increased our market share for the fourth consecutive year,
and maintained a superior profitability with a combined ratio about
10 percentage points better than the rest of the market.

Our agent network was key to this performance. In 2015, we com-
pleted the integration of the insurance business of UnipolSai Assi-
curazioni S.p.A., which we acquired in 2014, including its 725 agencies.
We also completed the introduction in the network of the common
Digital Agency platform, which benefits from simple, mobile and
paperless processes that drastically reduce administrative tasks for
both the agents and our back offices. Another innovation for our agent
network was the introduction of the Allianz1 Business modular offer
for small enterprises, complementing the Allianz] retail offer that we
introduced in 2014 and which has since reached 240,000 contracts.

In direct, Genialloyd premiums were up by 9.0%, outperforming
a contracting market. Property-casualty bancassurance premiums
also grew strongly, especially thanks to retail motor products distrib-
uted through the Italian branches of UniCredit.

Allianz Italy has also received strong market recognition with
awards from primary institutions such as “MilanoFinanza’ (Allianz1
Business, Digital Agency, and Genialloyd) and “Istituto Tedesco di
Qualita e Finanza” (Best Motor insurer in terms of quality for Agents
and the Direct channel).

In our life business, we had another year of strong premium vol-
umes, particularly supported by bancassurance and our personal
financial advisor network. Sales of low-capital-consuming unit-
inked products accounted for 81% of new business, compared to an
estimated market average of around 41 %.

The corporate structure in Italy was also streamlined in 2015
hrough the following transactions: We acquired the outstanding 50%
stake of Antoniana Veneta Popolare Vita, the Life Bancassurance joint
venture with Banca Monte Paschi di Siena, which had been held by the
partner bank. We also merged ACIE S.p.A., the financial holding com-
pany, into Allianz S.p.A. to simplify corporate governance. At the same
ime we acquired the minority shareholdings of Allianz S.p.A. held by
Allianz Subalpina Holding S.p.A. and Lloyd Adriatico Holding S.p.A.
Allianz S.p.A. is thus now fully owned by the Allianz Group.

France

Allianz France S.A. is a major provider of insurance and financial ser-
vices in the French retail and commercial markets, offering a broad
range of property-casualty and life/health products for individuals
and corporate customers. We distribute these offerings mostly via
agents, life and health consultants, brokers and independent finan-
cial advisors, as well as selected external partners. In addition, our
customers can research and buy products online — either through
‘eAllianz’ or via our direct sales channel ‘AllSecur’. In 2015 a new stra-
tegic plan ‘Innovation & Trust’ was launched for 2020. Capitalizing on
past successes such as the partnership with Drivy (car sharing),
Allianz France has given priority to fostering innovation. Examples
include a crowdfunding equity fund in partnership with SmartAngels,
a Pay As You Drive offer with TomTom as the first insurer in the French
market, as well as hackathons and a start-up accelerator.

Since local regulatory changes regarding cancellation rules were
introduced in 2014, the French retail property-casualty market has
seen higher customer churn. However, our constant focus on innova-
ive solutions, such as fast quotes, has allowed us to grow our cus-
omer base, for example in motor insurance. Furthermore, we con-
inue to be one of the leaders in the midcorp market (ranked as third
in midcorp and second in commercial property-casualty insurance).

With regards to the life market in France, we have responded to
he needs of our clients with a range of traditional and unit-linked
products in both group and individual business, combining financial
strength with the opportunity for more attractive yields. Evidence of
he success of this strategy is the increase in the unit-linked proportion
of our business mix from 39% in 2014 to 48% in 2015.

We also hold a strong position in the health market, often com-
bining elements of life, health and disability insurance as compre-
hensive solutions for individual and commercial customers.

Our retail insurance activities are also complemented by Allianz
‘Patrimoine’, which allows us to offer one-stop solutions, in particular
or our high-net-worth individual life customers.

Annual Report 2015 — Allianz Group

United States

Our property-casualty insurance business in the United States was
primarily conducted through Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company
(FFIC) until April 2015. In January 2015, our property-casualty insur-
ance business in the United States was realigned. The reorganization
comprised the integration of Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company’s
commercial business into Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty North
America (AGCS NA), the sale of the personal insurance business to the
global insurance company ACE, as well as the internal transfer of the
discontinued run-off business through a reinsurance agreement
within the Allianz Group. The sale, which took place by means of a
renewal rights arrangement, received regulatory approval from the
California Department of Insurance in March 2015 and closed in April
2015. We therefore focus on the Life business within this section. Our
life and annuity business is managed through Allianz Life Insurance
Company of North America (Allianz Life).

Our life and annuity business primarily underwrites fixed-index
and variable annuities and fixed-index universal life insurance prod-
ucts —all of which are sold through independent distribution channels,
as well as large financial institutions such as banks and wire houses.

Despite a competitive market environment in 2015, we main-
tained our position as the market leader in the fixed-index annuity
market as a result of an innovative index strategy introduced in 2014
and higher penetration into the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) licensed broker-dealer channel. Despite the modest interest
rate increase in December 2015, we believe the Federal Reserve is
likely to continue to raise interest rates very cautiously — leading to
only modest increases in interest yields in 2016. Although this low
interest rate environment remains challenging, we actively manage
our product pricing strategy to maintain profitability.

Strategy and Steering

As we celebrate !"# years of Allianz, we act from a position of strength. W e will
continue to protect the pillars of our success: our integrity, nancial strength,
technical competence, operational excellence, and talent base. However, our
world and our industry are changing fast and fundamentally, spurring us to

renew our way of doing business.

Building on our strong foundations, we will reinforce our leading position by
focusing our efforts in ve elds of action: putting our customers at the heart of
everything we do; becoming Digital by Default, everywhere; employing Technical
Excellence even more consistently; creating new Growth Engines; and fostering

a renewed corporate culture of Inclusive

Operating environment

Geopolitical instability, demographic and societal shifts, persistently
low interest rates — particularly in Europe — and uncertain economic
outlooks are putting severe strains on society and the global economy.
Meanwhile, digitalization is transforming economies and economics

at increasing speed, enabling new, easy-to-use, customized offerings
and fundamentally altering customer expectations.

Thriving in such an environment puts high demands on those
aspiring to be tomorrow s leading players, but it also holds huge
opportunities for those that manage to truly adapt to these new real -
ities. These leaders will adapt by: carefully balancing shock resilience
with capital ef ciency, establishing commanding market positions
and realizing visible bene ts from skills and scale, leveraging digital
to become customer-centric and agile, and relentlessly lifting pro -
ductivity reserves in the capital, cost, and revenue base.

The Renewal Agenda

Reinforcing our leadership position means building on our existing
strengths while acting decisively where the new environment
requires step change. Since spring "$!#, we have been mobilizing
management and employees globally to jointly develop our program

for the years to come in a highly inclusive and agile process. We
intend to leverage the best of Allianz to produce true scale advan -
tages and apply our strongest skills and assets even more systemati —-
cally, consistently, and ubiquitously. Five mutually reinforcing levers
will help us to further expand our competitive advantage:

58 Annual Report !"#$ — Allianz Group

Meritocracy.

True Customer Centricity: Achieving True Customer Centricity is at
the core of our agenda. Everything we do will only translate into suc -
cess if our clients trust us fully and experience superior value when -
ever dealing with us. By making superior customer experience the top
priority for all our actions, we strive to signi cantly increase custom = -
er loyalty in all our entities. For instance, systematic customer experi -
ence management will help us identify and enhance drivers of satis -
faction along the customer journeys. Fast product and service
solutions — such as Fast Quote/Fast Offer — will provide an immediate
response experience to customers in all our local entities. We will
measure progress against clear targets on Net Promoter Score %&’(),
which are rmly embedded into our planning process and incentives.

Digital by Default: Building further on our existing leading digital
assets and common Group platforms, we strive to become Digital by
Default everywhere. Based on a deep understanding of customer
needs, we will roll out new digital products, processes and commu -
nication globally. This will help increase both the convenience we
offer our customers and our productivity.

Technical Excellence: In Property-Casualty , we create superior mar -
gins, innovation, and growth by having the best technical talent and
consistently applying state-of-the-art skills. We will invest further in
advanced analytics, enabling superior risk selection, pricing, and
claims management practices. Within Life/Health, we will enhance
margins and reduce capital intensity through further shifting our
new business towards unit-linked and capital-ef cient products,
increasing the share of protection &health business and actively
managing our in-force business. Our investment management will

continue to capture economies of scale and skills, especially in asset-
liability management processes and by pooling our investment
man agement infrastructure, and will broaden the alternative asset
allocation.

Growth Engines: We systematically exploit new sources for pro table
growth across regions, business segments, and sales channels. This
means we will both consolidate existing leadership positions in
mature markets and secure our future potential in growth markets
with dedicated strategies, including new digital distribution models

and regional partnerships. We will enhance our product range by
replicating proven products, adding services, and driving innova -
tions, for example in Health insurance.

Inclusive Meritocracy: We reinforce a corporate culture where both
people and performance matter. The Renewal Agenda implies sig -
ni cant change for all our employees, including an increased degree

of agility and exibility. Consequently, collaborative leadership,
excellence with customers and markets, entrepreneurship, and trust

are the four cornerstones of our adjusted global management incen -
tive model. We remain committed to further strengthen diversity at
Allianz. We will measure progress in the company towards incorpo -
rating our renewed leadership principles by a newly de ned Inclusive
Meritocracy Index %*+*,), based on global employee feedback.

We will continuously advance our business model and set-up to sus —-
tainably ensure these ve levers have the greatest impact. For example,

we will further strengthen our regional platforms to capture true
scale bene ts, not only in terms of mere ef ciency gains but also cus-
tomer service, best practice capabilities, and digital transformation.

In addition, we will move further towards greater capital alloca -
tion discipline to free up signi cant resources for stronger value
creation. This means we will optimize our businesses for capital pro -
ductivity (return on equity) and reduced capital intensity (Solvency  **
sensitivity) and capitalize our local entities towards a more ef cient
capital base. On this base, we will ensure that capital is available and
fungible within the Group and allocated appropriately to nance
growth initiatives.

Annual Report !"#$ — Allianz Group

Ensuring successful execution

To enable successful execution of these policies throughout the
Allianz Group, we will systematically address the change process,
governance, and role of the corporate center:

- We will ensure mobilization of the entire global senior leader -
ship team across local entities, functions, and lines of business
in a new, horizontal change process. While the Board members
of Allianz (. commit as sponsors of the Renewal Agenda topics,
market experts and practitioners from our businesses will be
driving solutions development and implementation in agile
teams throughout the Group.

- We will enhance governance to even better facilitate capturing
skill and scale bene ts. We will also promote convergence of
business models and their execution globally. Aligned incentives
will now give more weight to local management s contribution
to Group value, beyond local business requirements.

- To increase agility and market focus of the corporate center, we
will bring top leaders from our strongest businesses into the
Group center while bringing functional experts from the Holding
into the markets. We will continue to streamline our holding
functions to put more focus on customer and market success
and the implementation of the Renewal Agenda.
We have de ned clear ambitions for "$!/ . With regard to nancial
performance, we strive for a return on equity (excluding unrealized
gains/losses on bonds net of shadow 012) of !3 4, while growing our
earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of #4. To
ensure sustainability of performance, we have set ourselves health
targets for customer loyalty and employee engagement. We expect at
least 5#4 of our businesses to be or become rated by their customers
as Loyalty Leader or above market in terms of &’(. At the same time,
we aim to increase our *+*, from 6/4 to5"4.

The Allianz Group steers its operating entities and business seg
ments via an integrated management and control process. This starts
with the de nition of a business-speci c strategy and goals, which
are discussed and agreed upon between the Holding and operating
entities. According to this strategy, a three-year plan is prepared by
the operating entities and aggregated to form the nancial plans for
the business divisions and the Allianz Group. This plan also forms the
basis for our capital management. The Supervisory Board then
approves the plan and sets corresponding targets for the Board of
Management. The performance-based remuneration of the Board of
Management is linked to short-, mid-, and long-term targets to
ensure effectiveness and emphasize sustainability. For further details
about the remuneration structure, including target setting and per
formance assessment, please refer to the Remuneration Report start

We continuously monitor our business performance against
these targets through monthly reviews to ensure that appropriate
measures can be taken in the event of negative developments. During
these reviews, we monitor key operational and nancial metrics.

two-fold: Firstly, we invest our proprietary assets, which include pre -
miums collected from our insurance customers. Secondly, in our
third-party asset management business, we invest on behalf of cus —-
tomers by tailoring products and solutions to best meet their needs.

As one of the world s largest asset managers and as an institu -

saw revenues plummet. However, alongside developments incom -

weakness in emerging markets. The slowdown in China continued,
while other major emerging market economies like Brazil and Russia
experienced severe recessions. Nevertheless, there were also some
bright spots in emerging markets like India and most eastern Euro -

Nonetheless, weather-related natural catastrophes were plentiful in

waves around the world to oods in Great Britain.
However, neither natural catastrophes nor political
the biggest challenges in !"#$. It was, in addition to economic chal -
lenges, technological change, which now fully encompasses the

woes posed

insurance industry. Digital technology and Big Data are transforming
the whole business model, the way the industry underwrites risks,
distributes products and communicates with customers. Against this
background, it is not surprising that industry consolidation gathered
pace in !"#$, resulting in deals such as the acquisition of the Chubb
Group by 12% Limited.

In the property-casualty sector, premium growth in advanced mar -
kets was basically unchanged from the previous year. Whereas the
ongoing — albeit slow — recovery supported demand for insurance,
particularly in Europe, softening prices in some markets and busi —-
ness lines put a damper on premium growth. In contrast to this,
emerging markets followed increasingly divergent trends. In par -
ticular, Latin America showed signi cantly slower growth than in
preceding years, dragged down by the severe recession in its biggest
economy, Brazil. The indisputable growth champion of !"#$ was
again emerging Asia, with a strong Chinese market as its driving
force. Encouragingly, the other heavyweight in emerging Asia, India,
returned to healthy growth, too. Overall, according to our own esti -
mates and based on preliminary gures, global premiums rose by
around *.$( in !"#$ (in nominal terms and adjusted for foreign cur -
rency translation effects).

67
Underwriting pro tability remained stable on average, with
combined ratios in most markets clearly below #'"(, re ecting lower
catastrophe losses. However, overall pro tability remained under
pressure as investment returns were challenged by very low interest
rates.

In the life sector, premium growth in advanced markets slowed
slightly in !"#$. While the &./. market was more or less stable, growth
in some European markets, for example in Italy, normalized after a
very strong performance in the previous year. By contrast, premium
growth in emerging markets was not only much stronger but actu -
ally picked up slightly. Even Latin America and Eastern Europe,
despite their economic troubles, kept up rather wellin —!"#$. However,
the dominance of emerging Asia — and in particular China — is even
more pronounced in life than in the property-casualty sector: In "#$,
almost half of all premiums in emerging markets were written in
China, and more than 0"( of all premium growth was generated
there. In total, according to our own estimates and based on pre -
liminary gures, global premiums grew by around — $."(_ in !"#$ (in
nominal terms and adjusted for foreign currency translation effects).

The stubbornly low yield environment posed the greatest chal -
lenge for pro tability in the life sector. Life insurers reacted mainly by
shifting the portfolio mix towards alternative and less liquid assets,
for example infrastructure. They also started to develop new product
concepts with reduced guarantees and fostered protection-type
products. All in all, insurers managed to shift the product mix
towards less capital-intensive products, safeguarding pro tability
and solvency positions.

Business environment !"#$
for the asset management industry

As described earlier, markets were highly volatile for the asset man -
agement industry. On the one hand they were supported by continu —-
ously low interest rates and quantitative-easing measures. Equity
and bond markets also developed positively. On the other hand, the
third quarter of !"#$, in particular, was tumultuous for global mar -
kets, which were impacted by the economic slowdown in China and
concerns about other emerging markets.

European equity indices were especially subject to strong uc -
tuations in the second half of the year. In the fourth quarter of —!"#$,
European equity markets developed favorably and rose above _!"#*
levels, driven by the announcement in December by the European
Central Bank of further supportive monetary measures. &./. equity
prices recovered strongly at the beginning of the fourth quarter of
!"#$ and the 31/415 nished the year in positive territory. However,
the !$ basis points increase inthe &./. federal funds rate at the end of
the fourth quarter hit equity investors. In addition, the continued
sharp decline in the price of oil burdened corporates and countries
exposed to oil production, as did ongoing concerns about the Chinese
economy. The effects of slowing growth in China and weak commodity
demand made !"#$ a dif cult year for emerging markets. As a result,
many Asia Paci c and emerging market indices lost ground compared
to the end of December !"#*.

During the year, bond markets were also impacted by uncertainty
surrounding the timing of the increase inthe &./. federal funds rate.
With the decision taken by the &./. Federal Reserve in December !"#$,
yields rose across most &./. bond classes, which led to a weak fourth
quarter of !"#$ in terms of strong net out ows from nearly all types
of mutual funds and asset classes in the United States.

Throughout the year, yields on the short end of the yield curve
grew at a faster pace than those at the long end, signaling falling
expectations for future inflation. Overall, mutual funds in "#$
recorded continued net in ows. In the United States, passive mutual
funds noted strong net inowsin _!"#$ driven by equities and bonds.
Active &./.mutual funds, in contrast, suffered notable net out ows in
!"#$ — mainly in&./. equities and taxable bonds. Money market funds
in the United States pro ted, especially in December _!"#$, from the
interest rate uncertainties. German mutual equity funds recorded
net in ows for the rst time in years. Furthermore, net in ows in

Due to further changes in the Board of Management, effective

Business segment overview

Allianz offers a broad range of life, health, savings, and invest -
ment-oriented products, including individual and group life
insurance contracts. Via our distribution channels — mainly tied
agents, brokers, and bank partnerships — we offer life and health
products to both retail and corporate clients. As one of the world-
wide market leaders in life business, we serve customers in more

than %$ countries.

On an internal basis Q statutory premiums decreased by" *,.+4 ,&

premiums shifted towards unit-linked and capital-ef cient products.
Decreased sales of traditional products in Germany and Italy more

and Taiwan. In addition, we recorded lower premiums from the xed-
indexed annuity business in the United States.

In the German life business, we recorded statutory premiums of

mo

lower

single premium business, which saw reduced sales of traditional life

products — which include long-term interest rate guarantees. This

ness. Statutory premiums in the German health business went up to

Our loadings and fees were up by" */’ ,& to" 1,##4+,&.

The growth in loadings from premiums of" ’/1 ,& was primarily
due to higher sales in Asia Paci c, the positive impact of lower volumes
of products with sales inducements in the United States, favorable
foreign currency translation effects, and increased unit-linked pre -
miums in Italy and France. This was partially offset by reduced single

premium business in Germany. Loadings from premiums asa per -
centage of statutory premiums rose by *’ basis points, largely
because of a higher proportion of regular premiums in Germany.

The increase in loadings from reserves of "1. ,& was mainly
driven by a higher reserve volume, particularly in Asia Paci c.

The growth in unit-linked management fees of" ’(( ,& was
largely due to higher assets under management in France and Italy
as well as increased performance fees in Italy.

Investment margin

The investment margin is dened as  4567investment income net of
expenses, less interest credited to 4567reserves and policyholder par -
ticipation (including policyholder participation beyond contractual

and regulatory requirements mainly for the German life business).

Our investment margin rose by "$(. ,& to "*,$’1 ,&, or by ’/ basis
points as a percentage of reserves. The increase was mainly driven by
higher realizations on both debt and equity investments, predomi -
nantly in Germany. It was also supported by higher interest income
largely from debt investments. As the volume effects of a higher asset
base were mostly offset by lower yields, this higher interest was pri

marily due to favorable foreign currency translation effects, arising
mainly in the United States. These increases were partially offset by
a negative foreign currency result on partially hedged emerging mar -
kets bonds and unfavorable impacts from nancial derivatives to
lengthen duration. Higher impairments on equities — mainly in the
German life business — as a result of volatile equity markets during
the year also contributed negatively.

The policyholder participation ratio decreased slightly, driven by

a drop in the policyholder participation in Italy and France.

indexed annuity sales in the United States and lower single premium
business in Germany were offset by higher acquisition expenses
mainly due to sales growth in Asia Paci c and Italy.

Administrative expenses increased predominantly because of
adverse foreign currency translation effects from our businesses in
the United States and in Asia Paci c.

(surrender charges and commission clawbacks) and reinsurance
result.

Our technical margin declined by "(+ ,& to"’,’1# ,& . This was driven
by additional reserving for an annuity take-up option in Italy and
increased provisions for unclaimed contracts in France. It was partly

primarily from increased realizations on equity investments in Italy.
This was offset by the impairment of the goodwill allocated to the cash
generating unit Asia Paci c, mainly driven by steadily decreasing and
persisting low interest rates in South Korea. The slight increase in the

Economic outlook%

At the beginning of ($#), the global economic picture is, broadly
speaking, split between industrialized countries and emerging mar -
kets. On the one hand, economic activity in industrialized countries

is likely to remain quite solid. In the United States, domestic demand
looks set to rm up further. In the Eurozone, the economic recovery

is likely to continue, supported by improved competitiveness and
lower energy prices. With real gross domestic product expected to
increase by #.*+, growth will be slightly higher than in ($#% Supported
by improving economic conditions in the Eurozone and a favorable
environment for private consumption, the German economy could
expand by more than ( +in ($#) . On the other hand, growth prospects
for several major emerging market countries remain subdued — for
both cyclical and structural reasons. Following a severe recession in
Brazil and Russia last year, economic activity is expected to gradually
stabilize in the course of ($#). Overall, global output is likely to
expand by about (.*+ in ($#), compared with (., + in ($#% Industrial -
ized countries are expected to register gross domestic product
growth of (.$+, while in emerging markets it could increase to -.*+
from the -.- + seen in ($#% which was the lowest economic expansion
since the great recession of ($$. . At the global level, in ation is likely
to remain very low, with a few exceptions in Latin America and Eastern
Europe, where in ation rates have risen sharply for country-speci c
reasons (for example in Venezuela and in Ukraine).

As in ($#% nancial markets will primarily be driven by mone -
tary policy and geopolitical tensions, but also by economic and polit = -
ical developments in major emerging market countries such as
China. On the monetary policy front, the Federal Reserve is likely to
continue to hike interest rates very cautiously this year. By contrast,
the European Central Bank is expected to keep key interest rates at
present or even lower levels throughout ($#). We also do not see any
trimming of the European Central Bank s unconventional measures
before the end of this year.

Slightly rising yields on #$-year /.0. government bonds, along
with growing speculation towards year-end about the timing and
manner in which the European Central Bank exits from its bond-
purchasing program in ($#*, will exert some upward pressure on
European government benchmark bond yields. However, with short-
term rates practically at zero, there are limited prospects of markedly
higher yields on longer-term bonds. We predict yields on #$-year
German and /.0. government bonds to climb modestly towards #+
and around (+, respectively, by the end of ($#) . In the coming months
a number of factors, including the expected rate increases by the Fed -
eral Reserve, will weigh on the Euro. However, with the economic
recovery in the Eurozone on a rmer footing, the Euro will gain sup -
port. We expect the year-end /.0. Dollar to Euro exchange rate to be
marginally above last year s closing level of #.$..

#—The information presented in the sections Economic outlook, Insurance industry outlook and Asset

management industry outlook is based on our own estimates.

Annual Report!"#$ — Allianz Group

Insurance industry outlook

($#) is set to become another challenging year for the insurance
industry. The big picture — characterized by only modest premium
growth, low interest rates, volatile nancial markets, new regulatory
burdens and digital transformation — will not change. As a conse
quence, industry pro tability will remain under pressure and restruc -

turing will gather pace.
However, that does not mean ($#) will be identical to the previ

ous year. For example, we expect to see interest rates starting to rise
— but only slightly: overall, the interest rate environment will con

tinue to present a headwind for the industry. Another important
change is the implementation of Solvency 1 lin Europe. This brings
more clarity on capital positions, acting as a possible catalyst for
more industry consolidation. High pent-up demand, accommodative
government policies — in particular in the life sector — and general
trends like urbanization continue to underpin relatively strong insur -
ance premium growth in emerging markets. Therefore, we expect
these markets to outgrow advanced markets in the foreseeable
future, although our outlook has become more cautious.

In the property-casualty sector, we anticipate stable premium growth
in advanced markets. While the ongoing recovery will support
demand, pricing is becoming a growing concern. Despite the region-
wide economic pickup, Western Europe is set to remain the laggard

in terms of global premium growth. On the other hand — as in previous
years — we expect very strong performances in emerging Asia. There,
government efforts — particularly in China — to raise insurance pene -
tration across the board are starting to pay off. Overall, we expect
global premium revenue to rise between __,.6 + and %$+ in ($#) (in
nominal terms, adjusted for foreign currency translation effects); a
good one percentage point of this is attributable to China alone. Due

to the challenging pricing outlook, underwriting pro tability may
come under pressure, especially if nancial losses resulting from
natural catastrophes return to historical averages. At the same time,
investment returns will remain weak, despite the expected rise in
interest rates.

In the life sector, the overall picture is quite similar — although pre -
mium growth is much more volatile than in the property-casualty
sector. In the coming year, this volatility may be exacerbated further

by new regulations, changing government policies and ensuing shifts

in the product mix. One thing, however, is unlikely to change: The
highest premium growth is expected in emerging Asia, where coun -
tries such as China and Indonesia should continue with high, in many
cases double-digit growth. Rising incomes and social security reforms
remain strong engines for growing insurance demand. All in all, we
expect global premium revenue to rise inthe _,.$ —%.$ range in ($#)
(in nominal terms, adjusted for foreign currency translation effects).

93
Looking at pro tability, there is no expected relief from the pains
associated with the low yield environment and regulation. As a result,
the rebalancing of investment portfolios will continue as well as the
shift in the product mix. New, less capital-intensive products, mixing
unit-linked product characteristics with some sort of return guaran -
tees, will increasingly replace the old-style savings products. At the
same time, mastering the digital transformation is becoming more
and more crucial. This mix of strategic challenges will not only spur
industry consolidation but could also act as a drag on overall pro t -
ability.

Asset management industry outlook

The markets widely expect the /.0. Federal Reserve to continue to
increase interest rates slowly in ($#) and to potentially start selling
the bonds accumulated in its post-crisis bond-buying program grad -
ually throughout the year. However, these actions are dependent on

the unemployment rate and in ation levels in the United States. In
addition, the extension of the policy of low interest rates and quanti = -
tative easing programs in the Eurozone and Japan in ($#) is very
likely. Thus, investors will continue to try to anticipate the central
banks moves and measures and we expect volatility to persist or
even increase in equity and xed income markets in ($#) . Global
market volatility could also be fueled by ongoing concerns about the
economic development in China, a further decrease in commodity
prices (such as crude oil) and a potential unstable geopolitical situ -
ation in certain regions. We have seen many of these factors combine

in the opening weeks of ($#) and the resulting impacts on nancial
markets and policymakers worldwide.

However, bonds should remain attractive if longer-term trends
towards moderately higher interest rates — especially in the United
States — are coupled with global demographic trends. For the growing
number of retirees in developed countries looking for a stable stream
of income, bonds are particularly interesting. This also holds true for
liability-driven investors.

Although we see a more challenging environment for the asset
management industry in ($#) , prospects for further growth in almost
all classes in the asset management industry are buoyed by these
positive economic conditions as well as trends in client demand.
However, pro tability in the industry is under pressure from con -
tinu ous ows into passive products and rising distribution and/or
marketing costs that are tightening operating margins. Measures
aimed at increasing regulatory oversight and reporting could also
affect pro tability in the asset management sector.

In order to continue growing, it is vital that asset managers have
suf cient business volumes, maintain ef cient operations and keep
investment results above benchmark levels.

Our outlook assumes no signi cant deviations from the following
underlying assumptions:

! Global recovery to continue.
! Subdued growth prospects for several major emerging markets.
! Modest rise in interest rates expected.

! A #$$basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would,
respectively, either raise or lower operating pro ts by approx -
imately " $.#&’ in the rst year following the rate change. This
does not include fair value changes in interest rate-sensitive
positions that are reported in our income statement.

! No major disruptions of capital markets.

! No disruptive scal or regulatory interference.

! Level of claims from natural catastrophes at expected average
levels.

! Average /.0. Dollar to Euro exchange rate of #.##.

! A #$+ weakening or strengthening of the /.0 . Dollar versus our
planned exchange rate of #.###to the Euro would have a negative
or positive impact on operating profits of approximately
" $.- &’, respectively.

Although the global economy is showing signs of recovery, invest -
ment results are likely to remain under pressure due to low interest
rates. This will be offset by an increase in our operating asset base.

Management s assessment of
expected revenues and earnings for !"#°

In ($#% our total revenues amounted to " #(%.(&’, representing a
(., + increase and a (.#+ decrease on a nominal and internal basis,
respectively , compared to last year. We expect a rather at revenue
development in ($#), with Property-Casualty advancing and Asset
Management revenues slightly decreasing. Life/Health revenues are
likely to be under pressure due to our selective focus on pro table
growth.

In ($#% our operating pro t was in the upper end of our target
range, hitting "#$.*&’. In ($#), we envisage an operating pro t of
" #$.%&’, plus or minus " $.%&’, as we expect a slightly lower operating
pro t in the Property-Casualty, Life/Health and Asset Management
business segments and a slight improvement in our Corporate and

Our net income attributable to shareholders increased, reaching

given the susceptibility of our non-operating results to adverse capi -

We expect our revenues to increase by approximately (+ in ($#)

— price effects as well as external growth. This growth is expected to
be supported by the acquisition of the commercial portfolio of Aegon,
strengthening our position in the attractive Benelux Property-Casualty
market.

Premium growth in ($#) is expected mainly from our European
core markets, including the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy. Top
line development will be further supported by positive trends at
Allianz Worldwide Partners, bundling our &(&(5 business activities.

We believe the overall slow rise in prices we witnessed inanum  -
ber of markets in ($#%will continue in ($#). However, as in previous
years, we will keep our focus on achieving strong underwriting results
by adhering to our strict underwriting discipline and will be willing
to accept a lower top line if target margins cannot be achieved.

In ($#% our combined ratio was at .,.) +. In($#), we expect prog -
ress towards our ($#3 ambition of ., + or better. This rests on our
expectation that the aggregate effect of improvements in pricing,
claims management, and productivity will compensate for any
underlying claims in ation. Despite the high volatility of natural
catastrophes in recent years, we have assumed such claims will be in
line with their expected average level in ($#).

As the low interest rate environment is likely to persist, invest  -
ment income will remain under pressure due to the rather short
duration of investments in the Property-Casualty business segment.

We will continue to take measures to adapt our investment strategy
to ongoing market conditions.

will continue to move our new business mix towards unit-linked,
capital-ef cient and protection products and will work on product
and distribution actions. We will actively manage in-force business
and work on expense management, asset/liability management, and
crediting strategies in order to mitigate the impacts of the dif cult
market conditions, particularly low interest rates.

It must be noted, however, that market volatility, along with the
level of net harvesting, can signi cantly affect the Life/Health busi -

Financing and liquidity
development and capitalization

The Allianz Group maintains a healthy liquidity position combined
with superior nancial strength and capitalization well above what
supervisory authorities currently require.

We expect to have steady access to nancial markets at reason-
able cost in order to maintain our strong nancial exibility. This is
supported by prudent steering of our liquidity resources and a matu -
rity pro le focusing on a long-dated average remaining term. Based
on current interest rate expectations, our average capital market
nancing costs in ($#) should be broadly in line with ($#%.

We closely monitor the capital positions of the Group and at the
operating entity level. Additionally, we will continue to optimize our
interest rate and spread sensitivities through asset/liability manage -
ment and life product design.

Expected dividend development+

In November ($#, , the Board of Management and the Supervisory
Board of Allianz 0< decided on a new allocation of net income in its
dividend policy. Starting with the nancial year ($#, , the proposed
regular pay-out to Allianz shareholders has been %$+ of Allianz Group
net income (attributable to shareholders).

In the interest of dividend continuity, the objective is to keep the
dividend per share at least at the level paid in the previous year. The
dividend policy of the Allianz Group continues to aim for a healthy
balance between an attractive yield and investments in pro table
growth. To assure capital discipline, management further intends to
evaluate and pay out any unused capital budget earmarked for exter = -
nal growth every three years. The rst evaluation will take place at the
end of ($#) . Out of a budget of " (., &’ for external growth (equals ($+

Liquidity and Funding Resources

Organization

The Allianz Group s liquidity management is based on policies and
guidelines approved by the Allianz !" Board of Management. Allianz !"
and each of the operating entities are responsible for managing their
respective liquidity positions, while Allianz !" provides central liquid -
ity pooling for the Group. Capital allocation is steered by Allianz !" for
the entire Group. This structure allows the ef cient use of liquidity and
capital resources and for Allianz!" to achieve the desired liquidity
and capitalization levels for the Group and its operating units.

Liquidity management
of our operating entities

OF 5/ &8( - ./ &0-+’

The major sources of liquidity for our operational activities are pri -
mary and reinsurance premiums received, reinsurance receivables
collected, investment income, and proceeds generated from the
maturity or sale of investments. These funds are mainly used to pay
claims arising from the Property -Casualty insurance business and
related expenses, life policy bene ts, surrenders and cancellations,
acquisition costs and operating costs.

We receive a large part of premiums before payments of claims
or policy bene ts are required, generating solid cash ows from our
insurance operations. This allows us to invest the funds in the inter = -
im to create investment income.

Our insurance operations also carry a high proportion of liquid
investments, which can be converted into cash to pay for claims.
Generally, our investments in xed income securities are sequenced
to mature when funds are expected to be needed.

The overall liquidity of our insurance operations depends on
capital market developments, interest rate levels, and our ability to
realize the market value of our investment portfolio to meet insurance
claims and policyholder bene ts. Other factors affecting the liquidity
of our Property -Casualty insurance operations include the timing,
frequency, and severity of losses underlying our policies and policy
renewal rates. In our Life operations, liquidity needs are generally
influenced by trends in actual mortality rates compared to the
assumptions underlying our life insurance reserves. Market returns,
crediting rates and the behavior of our life insurance clients — for
example regarding the level of surrenders and withdrawals — can also
have signi cant impacts.

Annual Report!"#$ — Allianz Group

&() * St &(*(4) -.7 — & 0-4"

Within our Asset Management operations, the most important sour-
ces of liquidity are fees generated from asset management activities.
These are primarily used to cover operating expenses.

1820+, -.(/ &0-+’

The major sources of liquidity in our Banking operations include cus -
tomer deposits, interbank loans and interest and similar income from

our lending transactions. The most important uses of funds are the
issuance of new loans and investments in xed income securities. The
liquidity of our Banking operations is largely dependent on the ability

of our private and corporate customers to meet their payment obliga -
tions arising from loans and other outstanding commitments. Our
ability to retain our customers deposits is equally important to us.

Liquidity management
and funding of Allianz!"

The responsibility for managing the funding needs of the Group,
maximizing access to liquidity sources and minimizing borrowing
costs lies with Allianz !". We therefore comment on the liquidity and
funding resources of Allianz !" in the following sections. Restrictions
on the transferability of capital within the Group result mainly from
the capital maintenance rules under applicable company laws and
the regulatory solvency capital requirements for regulated group
companies.

Allianz !" ensures adequate access to liquidity and capital for our
operating subsidiaries. The main sources of liquidity available for
Allianz !" are dividends received from subsidiaries and funding pro -
vided by capital markets. Liquidity resources are de ned as readily
available assets — speci cally cash, money market investments, and
highly liquid government bonds. Our funds are primarily used for
paying interest expenses on our debt funding, operating costs, internal

and external growth investments, and dividends to our shareholders.

Allianz !" s access to external funds depends on various factors such
as capital market conditions, access to credit facilities, credit ratings
and credit capacity. The nancial resources available to} —- Allianz !" in
the capital markets for short -, mid- and long -term funding needs are
described below. In general, mid - to long-term nancing is covered

Allianz risk pro le
and management assessment

"HS &?"() #4, © 1S). )4/" | &et-)4.

The Allianz Group is exposed to a variety of risks through its core

insurance and asset management activities. These include market,

credit, insurance, operational, business, and strategic risks. The three

largest risks in terms of their contribution to Allianz s risk pro le are:

! Market risk, especially interest rate risk due to the duration
mismatch between assets and liabilities for long-term savings
products as well as equity risk, which we take to bene t from the
expected risk premium;

! Credit and credit spread risks driven by assets backing long-term
savings products;

!Property-Casualty premium and reserve risks resulting from
natural and man-made catastrophes as well as from claims
uncertainty.

Allianz s risk pro le is driven by our strategic risk appetite and
steered by the risk management practices and limits which are
described later in this report. The risk pro le and relative contribu —-
tions have changed in "#$% due to changes in the market environ -
ment, management actions, and model changes driven by regulatory
developments and feedback Allianz received during the internal
model approval process. These model changes are described in the
section Model changes in "#$%.

In the following paragraphs we provide an overview of major
developments and risks that may affect Allianz s portfolio.
Financial markets and operating environment
The European Central Bank is continuing its expansive monetary
policy in order to ght low in ation rates and stimulate the Eurozone
economy. As a result, nancial markets are characterized by histori -
cally low interest rates and risk premia, prompting investors to look
for higher-yielding — and potentially higher-risk — investments. In
addition to sustained low interest rates, the challenges of implement -
ing long-term structural reforms in key Eurozone countries and the
uncertainty about the future path of monetary policy may lead to
continued market volatility. This could be accompanied by a ight to

quality, combined with falling equity and bond prices due to rising
spread levels, even in the face of potentially lower interest rates. Also,
possible asset bubbles (as observed in the Chinese equity market)
might spill over to other markets, contributing to increasing volatility
Therefore, we continue to closely monitor the political and nancial
developments in the Eurozone — such as in Greece during "#$%— in
order to manage our overall risk pro le to speci c event risks.

The persisting geopolitical risks, including the con icts in the
Middle East, are manageable for the Allianz Group, since our direct
exposure to the affected regions remains relatively small in the context
of our overall investment portfolio. Nevertheless, we are monitoring
these developments, since a signi cant deterioration may lead to
spill-over effects on the global nancial markets, triggering negative
impacts on our business and risk pro le.

Over the past years, Allianz Group and its operating entities have
developed operational contingency plans for various crisis scenarios.

We continue to conduct scenario analysis on a regular basis to bolster

our nancial and operational resilience to strong shock scenarios. In
addition, we continue to optimize our product design and pricing in

the Life/Health business segment with respect to guarantees and sur -
render conditions. Continuous monitoring as well as prudent risk
positions and contingency planning remain priorities for our man -
agement.

Regulatory developments
With the approval of our partial internal model &in November "#$%
the uncertainty about our future Solvency _”’ capital requirements has
been signi cantly reduced. Nevertheless, some uncertainty about the
future capitalization requirements of Allianz remains, since the
future capital requirements applicable for Global Systemically
Important Insurers (so-called (-)’’ s) are still not nalized. Finally, the
potential for a multiplicity of different regulatory regimes, capital
standards, and reporting requirements will increase operational
complexity and costs.

In any case, the Solvency ’’ regime will lead to higher volatility
in solvency ratios compared to Solvency ’, due to the market value
balance sheet approach.

! — From a formalistic perspective, the German Supervisory Authority deems our model to partial because
it does not cover all of our operations: some of our smaller operations report under the standard model
and others under the deduction and aggregation approach.

The Allianz Group s management feels comfortable with the Group s
overall risk pro le and has con dence in the effectiveness of its risk
management framework to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing
environment as well as day-to-day business needs. This con dence
is based on several factors, which are outlined in more detail in the
sections that follow and are summarized below:

! Due to its effective capital management, the Allianz Group is
well capitalized and met its internal-, rating agency- andregula_-
tory-solvency targets as of *$December "#$% Allianz is also con -

dent that it will be able to meet the capital requirements under
the new regulatory regimes. Allianz remains one of the highest-

rated insurance groups in the world, as re ected by our external
rating agencies.
! The Group s management also believes that Allianz is well posi-
tioned to deal with potential future adverse events, in part due
to our strong internal limit framework de ned by the Group s
risk appetite and risk management practices including our
approved partial internal model.

! The Group has a conservative investment pro le and disciplined
business practices in the Property-Casualty, Life/Health and
Asset Management business segments, leading to sustainable
operating earnings with a well-balanced risk-return pro le.

! Finally, the Group has the additional advantage of being well
diversi ed, both geographically and across a broad range of
businesses and products.

Capitalization
For the bene t of shareholders and policyholders alike, | Allianz s aim
is to ensure that the Group is adequately capitalized at all times and
that all operating entities meet their respective regulatory capital
requirements. Furthermore, risk capital and cost of capital are
important aspects taken into account in business decisions.

Our risk capital re ecting our risk pro le plays a signi cant role
in the management of capital across the Group. In addition, we take
into account the external requirements of regulators and rating
agencies. While capital requirements imposed by regulators consti —-

tute a binding constraint, meeting rating agencies capital require
ments and maintaining strong credit ratings are strategic business
objectives of the Allianz Group.

We closely monitor the capital position of the Group and its
operating entities along each of these dimensions, and apply regular
stress tests based on standard adverse scenarios. This allows us to

take appropriate measures to ensure our continued capital and sol
vency strength.

Internal risk capital framework

We de ne internal risk capital as the capital required to protect us
against unexpected, extreme economic losses, which forms the basis

for determining our Solvency ”’ regulatory capitalization and the
associated risk pro le. On a quarterly basis, we calculate and aggre = -
gate internal risk capital across all business segments, based on a
common standard for measuring and comparing risks across the
wide range of different activities that we undertake as an integrated
nancial services provider.

O)+) 1 *( *% Ue&*3?

We utilize an approach for the management of our risk pro le and
solvency position that re ects the forthcoming Solvency _ ”’ rules. This
comprises our approved partial internal model covering all major
insurance operations & Other entities are re ected based on their
standard model results as well as on sectoral or local requirements,

in accordance with the Solvency ’’ framework. Our partial internal
model is based on a best-practice technical platform with an up-to-

date methodology covering all modeled sources of quanti able risks.

"hE LEE LHS 3* 9" &,)(

Our partial internal risk capital model is based on a Value-at-Risk
(VaR) approach using a Monte Carlo simulation. Following this
approach, we determine the maximum loss in the portfolio value of
our businesses in the scope of the model within a speci ed time -
frame ( holding period ) and probability of occurrence ( con dence

level ). We assume a con dence level of .. .%/ and apply a holding
period of one year. In the risk simulation, we consider risk events from
all modeled risk categories ( sources of risk ) and calculate the port = -
folio value based on the net fair value of assets and liabilities under
potentially adverse conditions.

The risk capital is de ned as the difference between the current
portfolio value and the portfolio value under adverse conditions
dependent on the .. .%/ con dence level. Because we consider the
impact of a negative or positive event on all sources of risks and cov -
ered businesses at the same time, diversi cation effects across prod -
ucts and regions are taken into account. The results of our Monte
Carlo simulation allow us to analyze our exposure to each source of
risk, both separately and in aggregate. In addition, in particular for
market risks, we analyze several pre-de ned stress scenarios, based
either on historically observed market movements or on hypothetical
market movement assumptions. This modeling approach, therefore,
also enables us to identify scenarios that may have a positive impact
on our solvency situation.

! — As mentioned under Solvency- capitalization,12 Life is taken into account by means of third-country
equivalence into the Group capitalization.
116 Annual Report!"#$ — Allianz Group

Yield curve and volatility adjustment assumptions

When calculating the fair values of assets and liabilities, the assump —-
tions regarding the underlying risk-free yield curve are crucial in
determining and discounting future cash ows. We apply the method -
ology provided by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions
Authority 1+’<=/3 within the technical documentation ( +’<=/-
BoS-$%#*% for the extension of the risk-free interest rate curves
beyond the last liquid tenorS.

In addition, we adjust the risk-free yield curves by a volatility
adjustment for all business segments, except unit-linked business
with guarantees in most markets where a volatility adjustment is
de ned by +’<=/. This is done to better re ect the underlying eco” -
nomics of our business, as the cash ows of our insurance liabilities
are, to a large degree, predictable. The advantage of being a long-term
investor, therefore, is the opportunity to invest in bonds yielding
spreads over the risk-free return and earning this additional yield
component. Being a long-term investor mitigates to a great extent the
risk of forced selling of debt instruments at a loss prior to maturity.
Therefore, we re ect this mitigation using a volatility adjustment
spread risk offset, and view the more relevant risk to be default and
migration risk rather than credit spread risk.

Valuation assumption: replicating portfolios

Since ef cient valuation and complex, timely analysis is required, we
replicate the liabilities of our Life/Health insurance business as well

as for our internal pension obligations. This technique enables us to
represent all options and guarantees, both contractual and discre -
tionary, by means of standard nancial instruments. In the risk cal -
culation we use the replicating portfolio to determine and revalue
these liabilities under all potentially adverse Monte Carlo scenarios.

Diversi cation and correlation assumptions

Our partial internal risk capital model considers concentration, accu -
mulation, and correlation effects when aggregating results at Group
level. This re ects the fact that not all potential worst-case losses are
likely to materialize at the same time. This effect is known as diversi -
cation and forms a central element of our risk management frame -
work.

We strive to diversify the risks we are exposed to in order to limit
the impact of any single source of risk and help increase the chances
that the positive developments outweigh the negative. The degree to
which diversi cation can be realized depends in part on the level of
relative concentration of those risks and the joint movement of
sources of risk.

Where possible, we derive correlation parameters for each pair
of market risks through statistical analysis of historical market data,
considering quarterly observations over several years. In case historical
market data or other portfolio-speci c observations are insuf cient
or not available, correlations are set according to a well-de ned

Group-wide process. Correlations are determined by the Correlation
Settings Committee, which combines the expertise of risk and
ness experts. In general, we set the correlation parameters to represent

busi -

the joint movement of risks under adverse conditions. Based on these
correlations, we use an industry-standard approach, the Gaussian
copula approach, to determine the dependency structure of quanti -
able sources of risk within the applied Monte Carlo simulation.

Actuarial assumptions

Our partial internal risk capital model also includes assumptions on
claims trends, liability in ation, mortality, longevity, morbidity, policy -
holder behavior, expense, etc. We use our own internal historical
data for actuarial assumptions wherever possible and also consider
recommendations from the insurance industry, supervisory authori -
ties, and actuarial associations. The derivation of our actuarial
assumptions is based on generally accepted actuarial methods. With -
in our internal risk capital and nancial reporting framework, com -
prehensive processes and controls exist for ensuring the reliability of
these assumptions.

B&%)

By design, our partial internal risk capital model takes into account
the following risk categories: market risk, credit risk, underwriting
risk, business risk, and operational risk — whenever these risks are
present. A further breakdown of the risk categories can be found in
the section on internal risk assessment. With the exception of the
Asset Management business segment, all business segments are
exposed to the full range of stated risk categories. By contrast, the
Asset Management business segment is mainly exposed to opera’ -
tional and market risk and to a lesser extent to credit risk.

Coverage of the risk capital calculations
Allianz s partial internal risk capital model covers all major insur = -
ance operations &This includes the relevant assets (including bonds,
loans, mortgages, investment funds, equities and real estate) and
liabilities (including the cash ow run-off pro le of all technical
reserves as well as deposits, issued debt, and other liabilities). For
with-pro t products in the Life/Health business segment, options
and guarantees embedded in insurance contracts — including policy -
holder participation rules — are taken into account.5

Smaller entities within the European Economic Area which are
not covered by the partial internal model are re ected based on their
standard model results. At Group level, the capital requirements for
smaller insurance operating entities outside the European Economic
Area that have only an immaterial impact on the Group s risk pro le
are treated with book value deduction>.

Asset Management business is covered by adequate risk controlling
processes, including regular reporting and qualitative risk assess —-
ments (such as Top Risk Assessment) to the Group. However, since it

is mainly affected by the previously mentioned two risk types (opera -
tional and foreign exchange rate), and due to the fact that the impact

on total pre-diversi ed risk capital is minor, risk management with
respect to Asset Management is not discussed in more detail.

Limitations

Our partial internal risk capital model expresses the potential worst-
case amount in economic value that we might lose at a certain con -
#961
that actual losses could exceed this threshold at Group level in the

dence level. However, there is statistically a low probability of

course of one year.

We use model and scenario parameters derived from historical
data, where available, to characterize future possible risk events. If
future market conditions differ substantially from the past, forexam —-
ple in an unprecedented crisis, our VaR approach may be too conser -
vative or too liberal in ways that are too dif cult to predict. In order to
mitigate reliance on historical data, we complement our VaR analysis
with stress testing. Our ability to back-test the model s accuracy is
limited because of the high con dence level of
holding period as well as the fact that for some insurance risk events

.. .%l, the one-year

— such as natural catastrophes — only limited data are available.
Furthermore, as historical data is used where possible to cali -
brate the model, historical data cannot be used for validation. Instead,
we validate the model and parameters through sensitivity analyses,
independent internal peer reviews and, where appropriate, external
reviews by independent consulting rms, focusing on methods for
selecting parameters and control processes. To ensure proper valida = -

Group Risk responsible for validating our partial internal model

tion we established an Independent Validation Unit
within a comprehensive model validation process. Overall, we believe

that our validation efforts are effective and that the model adequately
assesses the risks to which we are exposed.

As described in a previous section, insurance liability values in
the risk calculation are derived from replicating portfolios of standard
nancial market instruments in order to allow for effective risk man -
agement. This replication is subject to the set of available replicating
instruments and might, therefore, be too simple or too restrictive to
capture all factors affecting the change in value of liabilities. As with
other model components, the replications are subject to independent
validation and to suitability assessments as well as to stringent data
and process quality controls. Therefore, we believe that the liabilities
are adequately represented by the replicating portfolios.

Since the partial internal risk capital model takes into account
the change in the economic fair value of our assets and liabilities, it is
crucial to estimate the market value of each item accurately. For some
assets and liabilities it may be dif cult, if not impossible — notably in
distressed nancial markets — to obtain either a current market price
or to apply a meaningful mark-to-market approach. For such assets
we apply a mark-to-model approach. Non-standardized derivative
instruments — such as derivatives embedded in structured nancial

tive types or by means of sensitivities, because the volume of non-
standard instruments is not material at either the local or Group
level. For some of our liabilities, the accuracy of their values depends
on the quality of the actuarial cash ow estimates. Despite these
limitations, we believe the estimated fair values are appropriately
assessed.

As we are an integrated nancial services provider offering a variety

of products across different business segments and geographic
regions, diversi cation is key to our business model. Diversi cation

is a key element in managing our risks ef ciently by limiting the eco -
nomic impact of any single event and by contributing to relatively
stable results and our risk pro le in general. Therefore, our aim is to
maintain a balanced risk pro le without any disproportionately large

risk concentrations and accumulations.

With respect to investments, top-down indicators such as stra -
tegic asset allocations are de ned and closely monitored to ensure
balanced investment portfolios. Furthermore, we have a limit system
in place which is de ned at Group level separately for the Life/Health
and the Property-Casualty business segments as well as at operating

entity level. The limits comprise economic limits, in particular nan -
cial VaR and credit VaR as derived from the internal risk capital frame -
work, complemented by stand-alone interest rate and equity sensi -
tivity limits as well as by limits on foreign exchange exposures. In
addition we introduced capitalization limits, de ning target Solvency

’’ capitalization ratios on Group as well as operating entity level after
applying shock scenarios.

Our limit-setting process ensures that prevailing statutory
restrictions regarding the composition of investments are taken into
account. Most statutory restrictions apply at the local level, where the
statutory restrictions as binding constraints enter the limit-setting
processes. In addition, guidelines are derived by the Group center for
certain investments, for example concerning the use of derivatives,
and compliance with the guidelines is controlled by the respective
risk and controlling functions.

In order to further limit the impact of any nancial market
changes and to ensure that assets adequately back policyholder lia -
bilities, we have additional measures in place. One of these is asset/
liability management, linked to the internal risk capital framework,
which incorporates risks as well as return aspects stemming from our
insurance obligations. In addition, we are using derivatives mostly to
either hedge our portfolio against adverse market movements or to
reduce our reinvestment risk — for example by using forwards or
swaptions.

Furthermore, we have put in place standards for hedging activi -
ties due to exposures to fair value options embedded in life insurance
products. Life/Health operating entities carrying these exposures are
required to follow these standards, including making a conscious
decision on the amount of hedging. &The hedging of risks stemming
from investments is also an element applied to manage and limit
risks ef ciently. For example, protective puts are used to limit the
downward exposure of certain investments5.

We also closely monitor concentrations and accumulation of
non-market risks on a stand-alone basis (i.e. before diversi cation
effects) within a global limit framework in order to avoid substantial
losses from single events such as natural catastrophes, terror or
credit events.

In order to manage counterparty concentration risk, we run a
Group-wide country and obligor group limit management frame
work (CRisP>), which covers credit and equity exposures and is based

on data used by the investment and risk experts at the Group and
operating entity levels. This limit framework forms the basis for dis

cussions on credit actions and provides noti cation services with a
quick and broad communication of credit-related decisions across

the Group. Clearly de ned processes ensure that exposure concen
trations and limit utilizations are appropriately monitored and man

aged. The setting of country and obligor exposure limits from the

Allianz steers its portfolio using a comprehensive view of risk and
return, i.e. results based on the partial internal risk model including
scenario-based analyses are used actively for decision making: on the
one hand, economic risk and concentrations are actively restricted

In addition, central elements of Allianz s dividend policy are
linked to the Solvency ”’ capitalization based on our partial internal
model. This shows that the partial internal model is fully integrated

Our total pre-diversi ed market risk showed an increase of 8 ".$9: Interest rate risk

mainly driven by equity and credit spread risk in the Life/Health seg

ment. The increase in equity risk was mainly driven by higher expo -
sure. This was partly offset by a decrease in interest rate risk, pre

dominantly due to management actions aiming at reducing our

sures. This, however, also contributed to some extent to the increase

interest rate sensitivity by asset/liability management

in credit spread risk, for example due to some duration extension on
the asset side. The decrease in in ation risk was mainly driven by the
hedging of in ation exposure and higher discount rates, resulting in
lower market values of in ation-sensitive liabilities and internal
pension liabilities. Real estate risk increased mainly due to higher
exposure.

As interest rates may fall below the rates guaranteed to policyholders

in some life/health markets, and given the long duration of insurance
obligations, we are speci cally exposed to interest rate risk because

we have to reinvest maturing assets prior to the maturity of lifecon = -
tracts. This interaction of our investment strategy and obligations to
policyholders forms an integral part of our internal risk capital
framework. In addition, our /CO approach is closely linked to the
internal risk capital framework and designed to achieve investment

We manage interest rate risk from a comprehensive corporate
perspective: While the potential payments related to our liabilities in
the Property-Casualty business segment are typically shorter in
maturity than the nancial assets backing them, the opposite usu -
ally holds true for our Life/Health business segment due to the long-
term life insurance contracts. In part, this provides us with a natural

As described above, the risk related to interest rates lies in the
fact that, in the long run, yields that can be achieved by reinvesting
may not be suf cient enough to cover the guaranteed rates. In con -
trast, opportunities may materialize when interest rates increase.
This may result in higher returns from reinvestments than the guar -
anteed rates.

Inflation risk

As an insurance company we are exposed to changing in ation rates,
predominantly due to our non-life insurance obligations. In addition,
internal pension obligations contribute to our exposure to in ation.
Since in ation increases both claims and costs, higher in ation rates
will lead to greater liabilities. In ation assumptions are already taken
into account in our product development and pricing and the risk of
changing in ation rates is incorporated in our partial internal model.

Equity risk
The Allianz Group s insurance operating entities usually hold equity
investments to diversify their portfolios and take advantage of
expected long-term returns. Strategic asset allocation benchmarks
and investment limits are used to manage and monitor these expo -
sures. In addition, equity investments fall within the scope of CRisP

Risks from changes in equity prices are normally associated with
decreasing share prices and increasing equity price volatilities. As
stock markets also might increase, opportunities may arise from
equity investments.

Credit spread risk
Our internal risk capital framework fully acknowledges the risk of
declining market values for our xed-income assets, such as bonds,
due to the widening of credit spreads. However, for our risk manage -
ment and appetite we also take into account the underlying econom -
ics of our business model; for example, the application of the volatil -
ity adjustment in our internal risk capital framework to partially
mitigate spread risk, as described in the section on yield curve
assumptions.

The advantage of being a long-term investor therefore gives us
the opportunity to invest in bonds yielding spreads over the risk-free
return and earning this additional yield component.

Currency risk

Based on our foreign exchange management limit framework, cur -
rency risk is monitored and managed at the operating entity and
Group level. As our operating entities are typically invested in assets
of the same currency as their liabilities, the major part of foreigncur = -
rency risk results from the economic value of our non-Euro operating
entities. If non-Euro foreign exchange rates decline against the Euro
from a Group perspective, the Euro-equivalent net asset values also
decrease. However, at the same time the capital requirements in Euro
terms from the respective non-Euro entity also decrease, partially
mitigating the total impact on the capitalization.

Real estate risk

Despite the risk of decreasing real estate values, real estate is a suitable
addition to our investment portfolio, due to good diversi cation
bene ts as well as to the contribution of relatively predictable cash-

ows in the long term. As of *$December "#$%about *.% 1"#$6:*.$7>3
of the total pre-diversi ed risk was related to real estate exposures.

Credit risk
The Allianz Group monitors and manages credit risk exposures and
concentrations to ensure it is able to meet policyholder obligations
when they are due. This objective is supported by the internal credit
risk model and the CRisP as described under the section on the risk
pro le. Group-wide credit data is collected following a centralized
process and using standard obligor and obligor group mappings.
Credit risk is measured as the potential economic loss in the
value of our portfolio due to changes in the credit quality of ourcoun = -
terparts ( migration risk ) or the inability or unwillingness of the
counterparty to ful ll contractual obligations ( default risk ). Our
internal credit risk modeling framework covers counterparty risk and

country risk. Counterparty risk arises from our xed-income invest = -
ments, cash positions, derivatives, structured transactions, receiv -
ables from Allianz agents and other debtors, as well as reinsurance
recoverables and credit insurance. Country risk exposure is calcu -
lated as cross-border exposure to all obligors domiciled abroad from

the respective operating entities perspective.

The internal credit risk capital model is a state-of-the-art tool
which provides bottom-up analysis. The major drivers of credit risk
for each instrument are exposure at default, ratings, seniority, col -
lateral and maturity. Additional parameters assigned to obligors are
migration probabilities and obligor asset correlations re ecting
dependencies within the portfolio. Ratings are assigned to single obli_—-
gors via an internal rating approach, which is based on long-term
ratings from rating agencies. It is dynamically adjusted using market-
implied ratings and the most recently available information.

The loss pro le of a given portfolio is obtained through a Monte-
Carlo simulation, taking into account interdependencies and expo -
sure concentrations per obligor segment. To re ect portfolio speci c
diversi cation effects, the loss pro les are calculated at different
levels of the Allianz Group structure (pre-diversi ed). They are then
fed into the overall partial internal risk capital model for further
aggregation across sources of risk to derive group-diversi ed internal
credit risk.

By managing our credit risk on the basis of our limit manage -
ment and credit risk modeling frameworks, we have composed a
well-diversi ed credit portfolio. Our long-term investment strategy to
hold investments through the cycle to maturity enables us to keep
our portfolio stable even under adverse market conditions. It also
gives us the opportunity to earn planned excess returns throughout
the entire holding period of the investments. In our credit insurance
business, proactive credit management offers opportunities to keep
losses from single credit events below expected levels and therefore
strongly supports writing business that contributes to a balanced
Group credit portfolio.

Assessing the risks as part of the underwriting process isa key ele -
ment of our risk management framework. There are clear under -
writing limits and restrictions, centrally de ned and in place across

the Group. In addition to the centrally-de ned underwriting limits,

the local operating entities have limits in place that take into account
their business environments. Excessive risks are mitigated by exter -
nal reinsurance agreements. All these measures contribute to a
limitation on risk accumulation.

Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, storms and oods, rep -
resent a signi cant challenge for risk management due to their accu -
mulation potential and occurrence volatility. In order to measure
such risks and better estimate the potential effects of natural disasters,
we use special modeling techniques in which we combine portfolio
data (such as the geographic distribution and characteristics of
insured objects and their values) with simulated natural disaster sce-
narios to estimate the magnitude and frequency of potential losses.
Where such stochastic models do not exist, we use deterministic,
scenario-based approaches to estimate potential losses.

The top ve perils contributing to the natural catastrophe risk as
of *$December "#$%were: Europe windstorm, Germany hail, Germany
ood, ,.). hurricane and ,.G. ood.

Reserve risk

We estimate and hold reserves for claims resulting from past events
that have not yet been settled. If the reserves are not suf cient to
cover claims to be settled in the future due to unexpected changes,
we would experience losses. The volatility of past claims measured
over a one-year time horizon de nes our reserve risk.

In general, our operating entities constantly monitor the devel -
opment of reserves for insurance claims on a line-of-business level. &
In addition, the operating entities generally conduct annual reserve
uncertainty analyses based on similar methods used for reserve risk
calculations. Allianz )+ performs regular independent reviews of
these analyses and Allianz )+ representatives participate in the local
reserve committees meetings.

Underwriting risk Life/Health

Underwriting risks in our Life/Health operations (biometric risks)
include mortality, disability, morbidity, and longevity risks. Mortality,
disability, and morbidity risks are associated with the unexpected
increase in the occurrence of death, disability, or medical claims on
our insurance products. Longevity risk is the risk that due to changing
biometric assumptions, the reserves covering life annuities and
group pension products might not be suf cient.

We measure these risks within our partial internal risk capital
model by distinguishing between the different sub-components,
whenever relevant or material: absolute level, trend, volatility around
the best estimate assumptions, and pandemic risks. Depending on
the nature and complexity of the risk involved, our health business is
represented in the partial internal model, according to Property-

Casualty or Life/Health calculation methods, and is therefore included
in the relevant Property-Casualty and Life/Health gures accordingly.
However, most of our health business is attributable to the Life/
Health business segment. Due to effective product design and the
diversity of our products, there were no signi cant concentrations of
underwriting risks within our Life/Health business segment as of
*$December "#$%5

Life/Health underwriting risk arises from pro tability being
lower than expected due to changes in actuarial parameters. As prof -
itability calculations are based on several parameters — such as his -
torical loss information, assumptions on in ation or on mortality,
and morbidity — the realized parameters may differ from the ones
used for calculation. For example, higher in ation than that incorpo -
rated in the calculations may lead to a loss. However, deviations can
also occur in the opposite direction and be bene cial and lead to
additional pro t. For example, a lower morbidity rate than expected
will most likely result in lower claims.

Business risk

Business risks include cost risks and policyholder behavior risks and
are mostly driven by the Life/Health business segment and to a lesser
extent by the Property-Casualty business segment. Cost risks are
associated with the risk that expenses incurred in administering
policies are higher than expected or that new business volume
decreases to a level that does not allow Allianz to absorb its xed
costs.

In the Life/Health business segment, policyholder behavior risks
are risks related to the unpredictability and adverse behavior of policy = -
holders in exercising their different contractual options: early termi = -
nation of contracts, surrenders, partial withdrawals, renewals, and
annuity take-up options. Assumptions on policyholder behavior are
set in line with accepted actuarial methods and are based on our own
historical data, to the extent available. If data is not available,
assumptions are based on industry data or expert judgment.

As for underwriting risks, a positive deviation from the under -

Operational risk

Operational risks represent losses resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes, from personnel and systems, or from external
events — including legal and compliance risk, but excluding losses
from strategic and reputational risk.

Allianz has developed a consistent Group-wide operational risk
management framework that focuses on the early recognition and
proactive management of operational risks in all rst line of defense -
functions. The framework de nes roles and responsibilities, risk pro —-
cesses, and methods and has been implemented in our operating
entities. Local risk managers as the second line of defense ensure
this framework is implemented in their respective operating entity.
They identify and evaluate relevant operational risks and control
weaknesses via a dialogue between the rst line of defense and the
risk function. Furthermore, operational risk events are collected in a
central risk event database. In "#$%Allianz also delivered internal loss
data on an anonymized basis to the Operational Riskdata eXchange
Association 1<2H3 , a global operational loss data insurance consor -
tium, to improve its internal control system and to validate opera -
tional risk parameters in the future. An analysis of the causes of inter = -
nal and external losses exceeding 8$0: is carried out to provide
comprehensive and timely information to senior management and
to share with operating entities, so they can implement measures
aimed at avoiding or reducing future losses.

The risks related to non-compliance or other misconduct are
addressed via various dedicated compliance programs. Written poli = -
cies detail the Allianz Group s approach towards the management of
these areas of risk. The implementation and communication of those
compliance programs are monitored by the Group Compliance func —_-

Group, the risk-mitigating measures are taken and enforced by a
global network of dedicated compliance functions throughout the

The decrease shown in the operational risk is driven by the regular

There are certain risks that cannot be fully quanti ed across the
Group using our partial internal risk capital model. For these risks we
also pursue a systematic approach with respect to identi cation,
analysis, assessment, monitoring, and steering. In general, the risk
assessment is based on qualitative criteria or scenario analyses. The
most important of these other risks are strategic, liquidity andrepu—-
tational risk.

Strategic risk

Strategic risk is the risk of an unexpected negative change in the
company s value arising from the adverse effect of management
decisions on business strategies and their implementation.

Strategic risks are evaluated and analyzed in the strategic and
planning dialogue between Allianz Group and its operating entities.
To ensure proper implementation of strategic goals in the current
business plan, strategic controls are carried out by monitoring
respective business targets. We also constantly monitor market and
competitive conditions, capital market requirements, regulatory
conditions, etc., to decide whether to make strategic adjustments. In
addition, strategic decisions are discussed in various Board of Man -
agement level committees (e.g. Group Capital Committee, Group
Finance and Risk Committee). The assessment of the associated risks
is a fundamental element in these discussions.

Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is de ned as the risk that requirements from current or
future payment obligations cannot be met or can only be met on the
basis of adversely altered conditions. Liquidity risk can arise primarily

if there are mismatches in the timing of cash ows on the asset and
liability side. Detailed information regarding the Allianz Group s
liquidity risk exposure, liquidity and funding — including changes in
cash and cash equivalents — is provided in Liquidity and Funding
Resources from © page #"$ onwards and notes $;, "*, "6 and 6* to

the consolidated nancial statements.

The main goal of planning and managing — Allianz )+ s liquidity
position is to ensure that we are always able to meet payment obliga —-
tions. To comply with this objective, the liquidity position of Allianz )+
is monitored and forecast on a daily basis. Strategic liquidity planning
over time horizons of $" months and three years is reported to the
Board of Management regularly.

The accumulated short-term liquidity forecast is updated daily
and is subject to an absolute minimum strategic cushion amount
and an absolute minimum liquidity target. Both are de ned for the
Allianz )+ cash pool in order to be protected against short-term
liquidity crises. As part of our strategic planning, contingent liquidity
requirements and sources of liquidity are taken into account to
ensure that Allianz )+ is able to meet any future payment obligations
even under adverse conditions. Major contingent liquidity require -
ments include non-availability of external capital markets, combined
market and catastrophe risk scenarios for subsidiaries, as well as
lower-than-expected pro ts and dividends from subsidiaries.

Our insurance operating entities manage liquidity risk locally,
using asset/liability management systems designed to ensure that
assets and liabilities are adequately matched. The local investment
strategies particularly focus on the quality of investments and ensure
a signi cant portion of liquid assets (e.g. high-rated government
bonds or covered bonds) in the portfolios. This also allows us to meet
increased liquidity requirements in the case of unlikely events. We
employ actuarial methods for estimating our liabilities arising from
insurance contracts. In the course of standard liquidity planning we
reconcile the cash ows from our investment portfolio with the esti -
mated liability cash ows. These analyses are performed at the oper —-
ating entity level and aggregated at the Group level.

Regarding our Asset Management business, forecasting and
managing liquidity is a regular process designed to meet bothregula = -
tory requirements and Group standards. This process is supported by
the liquidity management framework implemented in Allianz Asset
Management.

In addition, we launched a projectin "#$%o develop an enhanced
liquidity risk framework taking stress situations into account and
allowing for a group-wide consistent aggregation. The framework will
be rolled out to the Group during "#$- and will further strengthen the
Allianz liquidity position and resilience to stress scenarios.

and quantitative risk reporting and monitoring framework provides
senior management with the transparency and risk indicators to help
them decide on our overall risk pro le and whether it falls within del

egated limits and authorities. For example, risk dashboards, internal
risk allocation, and limit consumption reports are regularly pre

pared, communicated and monitored.
Risk strategy and risk appetite: Our risk strategy clearly de nes
our risk appetite. It ensures that rewards are appropriate for the risks
taken and that the delegated authorities are in line with our overall
risk-bearing capacity. The risk-return pro le is improved through the
integration of risk considerations and capital needs into decision-
making processes. This also keeps risk strategy and business objec -
tives consistent with each other and allows us to take opportunities
within our risk tolerance.
Communication and transparency: Finally, transparent and
robust risk disclosure provides the basis for communicating this
strategy to our internal and external stakeholders, ensuring a sustain -
able positive impact on valuation and nancing. It also strengthens

the risk awareness and risk culture throughout the entire Group.

As a key element of our risk management framework, Allianz s
approach to risk governance enables an integrated management of
local and global risks and ensures that our risk pro le remains con -

sistent with our risk strategy and our capacity to bear risks.

Supervisory Board and Board of Management

Within our risk governance system, the Supervisory Board and Board
of Management of Allianz )+ have both Allianz )+ and Group-wide
responsibilities and have set up committees to provide them with
support. Examples include:

128 Annual Report!"#$ — Allianz Group

Supervisory Board

The Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board monitors the effective -
ness of the Allianz risk management and monitoring framework.
Furthermore, it focuses on risk-related developments as well as gen -
eral risks and speci c risk exposures.

Board of Management

The Board of Management formulates business objectives andacor  -
responding, consistent risk strategy. The core elements of the risk
framework are set out in the Allianz Group Risk Policy, which is

approved by the Board of Management.

! The Group Capital Committee supports the Board of Manage
ment with recommendations regarding the capital structure,
capital allocation, and investment strategy, including the strate -
gic asset allocation.

! The Group Finance and Risk Committee 1(12B3 ensures over
sight of the Group s and Allianz )+ s risk management frame

work, acting as a primary early-warning function by monitoring
the Allianz Groups and Allianz )+s risk pro les as well as the
availability of capital. The (I2B also ensures that an adequate
relationship between return and risk is maintained. Addition

ally, the (I2B de nes risk standards, forms the limit-setting
authority within the framework set by the Board of Management
and approves major single nancing and reinsurance trans
actions.

Overall risk organization and roles in risk management
A comprehensive system of risk governance is achieved by setting

standards related to organizational structure, risk strategy and appe
tite, written policies, limit systems, documentation, and reporting.
These standards ensure the accurate and timely ow of risk-related
information and a disciplined approach towards decision-making
and execution at both the global and local level.

As a general principle, the rst line of defense rests with busi —-
ness managers in the local operating entities and = Allianz Investment
Management units. They are responsible, in the rst instance, for
both the risks of and returns on their decisions. Our second line of
defense is made up of our independent, global oversight functions
such as Risk, Actuarial, Compliance and Legal. Audit forms the third
line of defense . On a periodic basis, Group Audit independently
reviews risk governance implementation, performs quality reviews of
risk processes, and tests adherence to business standards, including
the internal control framework.

Group Risk

Group Risk is managed by the Group Chief Risk Of cer, who reports
to the Board member responsible for Finance, Controlling and Risk.

responsible for risk oversight through the analysis and communica
tion of risk management-related information and by facilitating the
communication and implementation of committee decisions. For
example, Group Risk is operationally responsible for monitoring the
limits and accumulation of speci c types of risks across business
lines, such as natural disasters and exposures to nancial markets
and counterparties.

In addition, Group Risk independently supports the adequacy of
the operating entities risk management through the development of
a common risk management framework and by monitoring adher
ence to Group minimum requirements for methods and processes.
Group Risk strengthens the Group s risk network through regular and
close interaction with the operating entities management and with
key areas such as the local nance, risk, actuarial and investment
departments. A strong risk network across the Group allows us to
identify risks early and bring them to the attention of management.

Operating entities

Operating entities are responsible for their own risk management,
including adherence to both external requirements (for example,
those imposed by local regulators) and internal Group-wide stan
dards. The operating entities Board of Management is responsible for
setting and approving a local risk strategy during the annual Strategic
and Planning Dialogues with the Group and for ensuring operating
entities adherence to their risk strategy.

All business line management functions with a direct pro t and
loss responsibility (i.e. rst line of defense , or risk-taking units )
are in charge of active risk-return management through adherence
to delegated limits and the operating entity s policy framework.

Second line of defense -functions support, challenge and have the
oversight of business functions through proactive risk management.

A risk function that is independent from the business line man
agement is established by each operating entity. This function oper
ates under the direction of the operating entity s Chief Risk Of cer. In
addition, a local Risk Committee supports both the operating entity s
Board of Management and the Chief Risk Of cer by acting as the pri-
mary risk controlling body. Group Risk is also represented on the local
Risk Committees to enhance the risk dialogue between the Group
and the operating entities.

Other functions and bodies

In addition to Group Risk and the operating entities risk functions,
legal and compliance and actuarial functions have been established
at both the Group and operating entity level, constituting additional
components of the second line of defense .

Group Legal and Compliance seeks to mitigate legal risks with
support from other departments. Legal risks include legislative
changes, litigation and disputes, regulatory proceedings and con
tractual clauses that are unclear or construed differently by the
courts. Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions,

Annual Report!"#$ — Allianz Group

material nancial loss, or loss to reputation that an undertaking may
suffer as a result of not complying with applicable laws, regulations,
and administrative provisions. The objectives of Group Legal and
Compliance are to ensure that laws and regulations are observed,
to react appropriately to all impending legislative changes or new
court rulings, to attend to legal disputes and litigation, and to provide
legally appropriate solutions for transactions and business processes.
In addition, Group Legal and Compliance is responsible for integrity
management, which aims to protect the Allianz Group, our operating
entities and employees from regulatory risks.

Group Actuarial contributes towards assessing and managing
risks in line with regulatory requirements. These risks stem from the
risk-taking/mitigating activities involving professional actuarial
experience. The role includes, but is not limited to, the activities of:

! calculation and oversight of technical reserves for accounting
and regulatory purposes,

!_ pricing and pro tability oversight,

!_ technical actuarial support of business planning, reporting and
result monitoring,

! contribution to the effective implementation of the risk manage —-
ment system.

In order to adapt to a continually changing environment, the Global
Issues Forum 1(’13 supports the Group in the assessment of long-
term trend changes in the risk landscape on a timely basis. As an
active participant of the Emerging Risk Initiative of the Chief Risk
Of cer Forum, we monitor with other chief risk of cers of major Euro-
pean insurance companies and nancial conglomerates the industry -
wide risk landscape and raise awareness of major risks for the insur -
ance industry.

Risk management priorities for ’)!0

In addition to maintaining our high standards and practices in day-
to-day risk management and controlling, Allianz has set the following
priorities for "#$-:

Our rst priority is to further embed our partial internal model
into business steering, for example by providing sound information
on potential impacts of management decisions on the Allianz risk
pro le.

Regarding regulatory developments, our second priority is to
ensure that we meet the emerging requirements for —_(- )’’ (Global Sys-
temically Important Insurers). Therefore, we will continue to partici = -
pate in the capital eld-testing exercise conducted by the 7) (Inter -
national Association of Insurance Supervisors). In addition, we will
continue to further enhance and strengthen our liquidity risk man -

agement framework.

Further future challenges
and opportunities=

The success of our business is heavily affected by a variety of global,
long-term issues. To ensure our sustainable and pro table growth,
our strategy places a high priority on monitoring, analyzing and
responding to the challenges and opportunities these issues present,
today and tomorrow.

By consistently following our Group strategy, we are con dent
that the Allianz Group is in a privileged position to deal with the chal -
lenges and opportunities ahead. The most important of these are
outlined below.

Global warming could alter our climate and such changes could
result in a range of risks and opportunities that affect our entire busi —-
ness. We have a Group-wide strategy covering climate-related risks
and opportunities for our business and our customers: we nance

and insure low-carbon energy projects, such as wind and solar, offer
customers a range of green solutions, and provide them with advice

on weather-related risk reduction. As a company we continually
reduce and offset our own carbon emissions. We also incorporate not
only environmental, but also social and governance factors into our
investment and underwriting processes as well as in asset manage -
ment.

Demographic changes are also creating both opportunities and
challenges for nancial services providers. While the urban popula —-
tions of Asia and Africa are expanding and their middle classes grow -
ing, Western populations are aging and their workforces shrinking.
With more people over -# years old than ever before and declining
birth rates, social security systems are under pressure and demand
is growing for additional accumulation as well as decumulation
products. We are responding to these trends by providing integrated

insurance and asset management solutions. Our solid market posi
tion in continental Europe and the United States as well as our strong
brand and well-diversi ed product portfolio put us in an excellent
position to develop solutions to meet the needs of the retirement,
health care, and assistance markets.

In addition, many of the world s industrialized nations are reliant
on infrastructure that is *# to %#years old, and yet public-sector
investments in this area have been declining across the board. In
order to upgrade this aging infrastructure, billions of Euros are
required per year — gures that most governments are not able to
cover, especially considering the increase in social security spending
due to demographic effects. At the same time, the current workforce
is faced rst and foremost with the need to accumulate adequate
funds for retirement, which is proving very dif cult in the sustained
low interest rate environment. We are at the forefront of bringing

these two challenges together to nd solutions for the long term:
bridging the public-sector infrastructure investment gap and provid -
ing pro table retirement provisions. The amendment of the Solvency ”
Delegated Regulation reducing the required amount of regulatory
capital for such investments led to increased incentives for insurers

to invest in infrastructure projects. The Allianz Group has multi-year
experience within this asset class and bene ts from its scale which
allows direct access to this asset class as the Allianz Group can also
invest in large transactions.

In emerging economies, the need for formal social security systems
is growing due to the weakening of traditional family ties and support
networks. From life to health and crop insurance, our growing micro -
insurance portfolio helps low-income families in developing countries
protect themselves against — and better manage — the risks in life to
build a more secure future. For example, in Asia, Allianz is working
on an insurance model for rice farmers based on satellite technology.

The accounting and consolidation processes we use to produce con -

to the Holding. Access rights to accounting systems are managed
according to strict authorization procedures.

Accounting rules for the classi cation, valuation and disclosure

Our approach can be summarized as follows:

8 We use a top-down, risk-based approach to determine the
accounts and operating entities that should fall under the
of our internal control system over nancial reporting.

scope
The meth -
odology is described in our -./01 manual. During the scoping
process, materiality and susceptibility to a misstatement are
considered simultaneously. The nal results are documented in

the list of operating entities under the scope of _-./O1 as well as
in the list of signi cant accounts. In addition to the quantitative
-/01 calculation, we also consider qualitative criteria — such as
expected increase in business volume — which are provided by
different Group Centers, Group Audit and external Audit.

8 Then, our local entities identify risks that could lead to material
nancial misstatements including all relevant root causes (i.e.
human processing errors, fraud, system weaknesses, external

factors, etc.). After identifying and analyzing the risks, the poten
tial impacts and occurrence probabilities are evaluated.

8 Preventive and detective key controls over the nancial reporting
process have been put in place to reduce the likelihood and the
impact of nancial misstatements. If a potential risk material

izes, actions are taken to reduce the impact of the nancial mis
statement. Given the strong dependence of nancial reporting

processes upon information technology systems, we also imple
ment -7 controls.

8 Finally, we focus on ensuring that controls are appropriately
designed and effectively executed to mitigate risk. We have set
consistent documentation requirements across the Allianz
Group for elements such as processes, related key controls and
their execution. We conduct an annual assessment of our control

system to maintain and continuously enhance its effectiveness.

Group Audit and local internal audit functions ensure that the

overall quality of our control system is subjected to regular con -

trol-testing, to assure reasonable design and operating effective —-
ness. Internal Audit does so through a comprehensive risk-based
approach, which holistically assesses the key controls of the
company s internal procedures and processes, including local
and Group internal controls over nancial reporting.

Responsibility for ensuring the completeness, accuracy and reliability
of our consolidated nancial statements rests with the Chairman of

the Board of Management and the Board member responsible for
Finance, Controlling and Risk of Allianz 24, supported by Group Center
functions, the Group Disclosure Committee and operating entities.

The Group Disclosure Committee ensures that these board
members are made aware of all material information that could
affect our disclosures and assesses the completeness and accuracy
of the information provided in the quarterly and annual nancial
reports. The committee met on a quarterly basis before the nancial
reports were issued.

Subsidiaries within the scope of our control system are individu -
ally responsible for adhering to the Group s internal governance and
control policy and for creating local Disclosure Committees that are
similar to the Group-level committee. The entities .4/ s and .0/ s
provide periodic sign-offs to the management of Allianz 24, certifying
the effectiveness of their local system of internal controls as well as
the completeness, accuracy and reliability of nancial data reported

enhanced internal control environment across our largest Life insur -
ance operating entities for the Market Consistent Embedded Value

Risk capital controls

Similar to our -./01 framework, we have also established a robust
and comprehensive control concept in the risk capital calculation and
aggregation process, since our internal risk capital calculations
incorporate economic factors that are not fully re ected in the
accounting results. We have put in place additional controls within
our management reporting processes to ensure that these additional
estimates are adequately controlled and that the data quality is
accurate, consistent and complete.

These controls include the validation of models and assumptions
by independent reviews and continuous benchmarking to market and /
or peer assumptions and practices. We benchmark and explain our
non-market assumptions against practices in the industry, actuarial
associations and guidance from supervisory authorities.
