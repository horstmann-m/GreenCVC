Fiscal 2015 Activity Report

3.1 Fiscal 2015 Activity Report

3.1.1 FISCAL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS

Fiscal 2015 was a year of solid financial performance,
shaped by promising integrated services contract wins
and sustained demand for Benefits and Rewards Services.
During the year, the Group pursued its transformation
and strengthened its position as world leader in Quality
of Life Services.

A solid financial performance

e Sodexo’s consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2015
amounted to nearly 20 billion euro, an increase of
10% over Fiscal 2014 that was partly attributable to
the euro’s weakness against other currencies;

© organic revenue growth was 2.5%, with increases of
2.2% for On-site Services and 9.5% for Benefits and
Rewards Services;

© operating profit increased in all geographic regions,
rising 21.7% to 1,143 million euro. Excluding
exceptional items in Fiscal 2014 and at constant
currencies, operating profit rose 11.9%, which
represents a 0.4% increase in the operating margin;

e Group net income totaled 700 million euro, an increase
of 42.9% over Fiscal 2015 or around 32% at constant
currencies that was partly due to a reduction in net
financing costs achieved by refinancing debt at lower
interest rates and also to a decrease in the effective
tax rate which benefited from non-recurring items;

e net cash provided by operating activities amounted to
1.0 billion euro versus 825 million euro in Fiscal 2014,
an increase of 23% that once again demonstrates
Sodexo’s ability to generate large amounts of cash year
after year.

In light of these excellent results, the Board of Directors

will propose a dividend of 2.20 euro per share, an

increase of 22.2%, and during Fiscal 2016 will launch

a 300-million euro share repurchase and cancellation

program in Fiscal 2016

Major integrated services contract wins

Clients are increasingly choosing Sodexo as a multi-
site and multi-services strategic partner for improving
the quality of life of their employees and enhancing the
performance of their organization

In the Corporate Services segment, the Group continued
to deploy an integrated services program in several
Asian countries under a global strategic partnership with
Unilever begun in 2012. Diageo also chose Sodexo as its
strategic partner to manage its 68 sites in the United
Kingdom and Ireland, including the London headquarters,
regional centers, plants, distilleries and warehouses.
Another multi-site, multi-service contract with Atento in
Brazil was extended to its three sites in Chile employing
a total of 3,500 people. In France, the Group was chosen
to manage the quality of life of the employees of Lacoste-
Devanlay working in its two main sites in Paris. Lastly,
in the United States, Chevron chose Sodexo to provide a
wide range of facilities management services at 13 sites
located in California, Texas, Louisiana and Pennsylvania

In Justice Services in the United Kingdom, following
its success in providing prison services, the Group
signed and mobilized a contract for the management
of the government's offender rehabilitation program
in six regions in England and in Scotland. The program
helps prepare prison inmates for a successful return to
mainstream society, with the aim of reducing the re-
offending rate.

In Remote Sites, several integrated services contracts were
won in Russia, Peru and Chile in the mining sector. The
United States Army has qualified Sodexo as an approved
contractor for the operation and maintenance of its health
care centers throughout the world.

In the Sports and Leisure segment, Sodexo won the
contract to provide food and hospitality services for the
California Academy of Sciences Museum in San Francisco.
The Quality of Life Services contract with the Clairefontaine
National Football Center in France was renewed for a
further four years and includes full management of the
new training and conference center. Lastly, the Lido music
hall in Paris re-opened in April with a completely new show
created and directed by Franco Dragone

In Health Care in the United States, the Group leveraged its
commitment in favor of patient well-being to expand its
foodservices and nutrition contract with UMass Memorial
Medical Center to include three more sites and to win
new contracts with Vidant Health System for its seven
hospitals in North Carolina and with Tenet Health System
in Texas.

In the Seniors segment, the Group reported several
successes in Canada, the United States and Italy. The
contract with the Hilver Zorg hospital's five sites in the
Netherlands was renewed, thanks to the plan proposed by
the Group to transform the foodservices areas and open
them to the local community. In emerging markets, Sodexo
was awarded a contract by the Pune hospital in India to
have it manage its technical and engineering services,
and won its first hospital contract in Indonesia. Sodexo
also will provide foodservices to over 1,200 patients and
2,000 health care professionals at Huangshi Central
Hospital in China

Lastly, in the Education segment, Sodexo’s innovative
service offerings led to the signature or renewal of
contracts in France, the United Kingdom, Finland, Canada,
the United States and, in emerging markets, in China and
Singapore for international schools.

These new contracts confirm the relevance of the
Group's strategy, deepening its presence in emerging
markets (which accounted for 20% of Group revenues
in Fiscal 2015) while also strengthening its expertise in
delivering an increasingly wide range of services in order
to offer the highest possible level of integrated services
to clients throughout the world. Today, 29% of Group
revenues are derived from facilities management services.

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Fiscal 2015 Activity Report

Sustained Benefits and Rewards Services activity
despite a more difficult environment in Brazil, thanks to
several factors:

e winning new clients in all regions;

e a tentative return to growth in Europe in the fourth
quarter;

e continuous expansion of the service offer, as much
through technological innovation as through new
ideas; and

e the acquisition of Motivcom plc, a specialist in
employee benefits, rewards and incentive solutions
for companies in the United Kingdom, allowing Sodexo
to become European leader in this market.

In addition, inflation-driven increases in face values and
interest rates helped to maintain the Benefits and Rewards
record of solid growth. The growth rate was particularly
strong in Latin America during Fiscal 2015.

3.1.1.1 FURTHERING QUALITY OF LIFE

Convinced that the quality of life of individuals is a
performance driver for organizations, Sodexo was an early
investor in research to better understand the stakes and to
measure organizations’ perception of the value of quality
of life, with the support of its Quality of Life Institute.

In 2015, the Group launched an international survey of
780 leaders and decision-makers working in companies,
hospitals and universities in six countries (Brazil, China,
France, India, United Kingdom, United States). According
to this Sodexo/Harris Interactive survey entitled “How
leaders value quality of life in their organization,” 66% of
respondents in developed and emerging countries consider
that improving quality of life is a strategic priority for
their organization. Ninety-one percent of respondents
agreed that there is a link between quality of life and
their organization's performance, with 57% saying that
they “totally agreed” with this proposition. Their replies
were based on recent experience, as evidenced by the
fact that 86% of respondents have already implemented
at least three initiatives related to quality of life within

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

their organization. Lastly, over 65% of respondents “fully
agreed” that improving the quality of life of employees and
consumers would be a critical factor in the coming years
The growing emphasis on quality of life is a response to
the new realities of a changing world.

In view of the strategic role of quality of life as a key
social and economic performance driver, in May 2015
Sodexo organized the first International Quality of Life
Conference in New York. Over two days, hundreds of
leaders from a wide range of backgrounds, including the
business community, academia, health care, NGOs and
the political sphere gathered to collaborate and challenge
current social and economic performance models. Over 30
different nationalities were represented at the event, and
the next generation of leaders who will drive change in
the years to come took part alongside today's influential
decision-makers. At the heart of the debate, there was
one shared preoccupation: to identify solutions to
foster economic growth alongside social progress. The
presence of leaders from throughout the world provided
an opportunity to establish relations based on these new
ideas with clients or potential clients from Poland, Brazil
and France.

In parallel, since 2014 Sodexo has led the Quality of
Life Observer, the first online media to monitor and
interpret the components that contribute to quality of
life in environments as diverse as businesses, health care
facilities, campuses and schools, remote sites and prisons.

In order to realign its service offering, Sodexo has identified
six dimensions that have a direct impact on quality of life:
e the promotion of health and well-being;

e the creation of conditions for collaborative efficiency;
e asecure and safe physical environment;

e the encouragement of social interactions;

e personal growth; and

e support for individual recognition

3.1.1.2 INNOVATION-LED GROWTH

Several projects were launched during the year to
invigorate the innovation drive, including:

e creation of a dedicated digital team to more effectively
Jeverage the Quality of Life promise by improving

services and relations between the Group and its
consumers through

¢ applications such as MySodexo App, SoHappy and
Apple Watch that provide information about menus
and peak times in the restaurants, or the balance on
the user’s account, or that offer concierge services,
or give a list of restaurants or shops that accept
Sodexo vouchers or the Sodexo Pass,

e loyalty programs such as Reward Tree,

e the promotion of well-being on platforms with an
educational content such as Mindful,

¢ participation in start-up networks, for example The
Village, an open club for innovators in Paris, and
the future Camp, an American-style digital campus
located between Aix-en-Provence and Marseille that
is currently under construction;

e a project to strengthen continuous research and
optimization of the organization and resources
dedicated to producing and delivering Quality of Life
Services on a large scale

3.1.1.3, CREATING A COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGE THROUGH
OUR PEOPLE

The world’s 19th largest private sector employer with
420,000 employees in 80 countries, Sodexo is a
community of men and women whose engagement is
key to client and consumer satisfaction and, therefore,
a genuine competitive advantage. That is why the Group
implemented several major initiatives during the year,
based on the following priorities:

e maintain a high quality, diverse and appropriately
sized workforce to meet the expectations of all clients;

e@ rank among the global companies most appreciated
by its employees.

With 95% of staff in daily contact with clients and

consumers, Sodexo is convinced that client and consumer

satisfaction depends on its teams’ skills and talent.

Keeping this in mind, during the year the Group:

e continued to invest in training: in order to provide
opportunities for employees to develop and grow,
Sodexo delivered some 5 million hours of training

124 Sodexo - Fiscal 2015 Registration Document


--- Page 4 ---

in Fiscal 2015. The Group also stepped up its
commitment in this area by creating a facilities
management training center for site managers. The
curriculum focuses on the essential factors behind
the efficient, profitable and safe management of
increasingly technical and complex contracts that now
frequently have a longer duration;

e further strengthening its standards for the
management of workplace health and safety, which
represents a potential source of improvements in
employees’ quality of life and a source of efficiency
gains through a reduction in work stoppages and
absenteeism;

e extending to 22 countries the Sodexo Supports Me
service that helps employees to overcome day-to-day
challenges at work and in their personal life, by putting
them in contact with recognized external consultants.

3.1.1.4 GOVERNANCE CHANGES

During Fiscal 2015, Sophie Bellon continued to prepare
to succeed Pierre Bellon to become Chairwoman of the
Board of Directors, notably by:

1) deepening her knowledge of the various Group entities,
in particular by participating in strategy meetings and
visiting sites and meeting management of subsidiaries
and operational teams;

2) seeking potential candidates for election to the Board
of Directors and integrating new Board members.

3.1.1.5 CORPORATE SOCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY AWARDS
AND INITIATIVES

In Fiscal 2015, the Group won several major awards
recognizing its commitment to social, environmental and
economic responsibility:

Sodexo was named “global leader for its industry” by
the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) for the
11th consecutive year and the number one consumer
services company for the second year in a row. DJSI is

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Fiscal 2015 Activity Report

the longest-running global sustainability benchmark
worldwide and the key reference point in sustainability
investing for investors and companies alike. The annual
DJSI review is based on a thorough analusis of corporate
economic, environmental and social performance,
assessing issues such as Corporate Governance, risk
management, climate strategy, environmental policy/
management systems, supply chain standards and labor
practices

Among the initiatives launched during the year, Sodexo
announced an ambitious objective to reduce carbon
emissions 34% by 2020 compared to 2011 across all
internal operations and the entire supply chain. The
methodology was developed jointly with the World Wildlife
Fund (WWF).

In October 2015, for the second year in a row, Sodexo
topped the list of publicly quoted companies for gender
balance published by the French Ministry of Women’s
Rights. The award concerns sustained gender balance
both in the Group’s top management and its operational
teams. The first place in the ranking recognizes not only
that 43% of Sodexo's Executive Committee and 38% of its
Board of Directors are women, but also Sodexo’s creation
of strong women’s networks throughout the global
organization and the commitment to gender equality at
the heart of its strategy and performance.

Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) named Sodexo as the
leader for the Hotel, Restaurants and Leisure sector in
its 2014 CDP Global Forests Report which recognizes
companies that are meeting the challenge of removing
deforestation from their supply chains. Sodexo was also
recognized in the report as the most improved company
in the sector.

Lastly, the Group was behind the creation of an
independent not-for-profit International Food Waste
Coalition (“IFWC"), with members representing the entire
value chain in the food services industry. IFWC’s key
objectives include actively promoting strategies to reduce
food waste, including by consumers

Currency effects

Sodexo operates in 80 countries. The percentages of total revenues and operating profit denominated in the main
currencies are as follows:

U.S. dollar 39% 44%
Euro 26% 11%
UK pound sterling 10% 7%
Brazilian real 5% 21%

During Fiscal 2015, the U.S. dollar and the UK pound
sterling strengthened considerably against the euro,
gaining 17.4% and 10.3% respectively, while the Brazilian
real declined 6%.

With effect from the fiscal year ended August 31,
2010, for the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements the Group applied the specific IFRS accounting
requirements to the transactions of its subsidiaries
operating in Venezuela that use the local currency as
their functional currency. On February 10, 2015, the
Venezuelan government announced that it was setting up
anew foreign exchange platform called SIMADI (Marginal
Currency System). In mid-July 2015, Sodexo decided to
transition to the new platform and started bidding for
U.S. dollars on SIMADI. The Group considers that the best
estimate of the exchange rate at which funds from its
activities in Venezuela could be repatriated is the rate
observed on August 28, 2015 on the SIMADI platform.
The exchange rate used for the year ended August 31,
2015 is therefore 1 U.S. dollar = 198.96 bolivars (1 euro =
223.14 bolivars). The effect of this depreciation (including
on the consolidated statement of financial position in
which year-end exchange rates are used) is not material
at Group level, as the Group’s operations in Venezuela now
represent just 0.1% of consolidated revenues and less
than 0.5% of consolidated operating profit.

3.1.2.2 REVENUE GROWTH

Consolidated revenue for Fiscal 2015 amounted to
19.8 billion euro, an increase of 10% including organic
growth of 2.5%. Favorable changes in exchange rates
had a positive impact not only on revenues but also on
all other income statement items.

Organic growth for the On-site Services activity was
2.2%. In a global economy that saw moderate growth,
with some emerging economies particularly in Latin
America experiencing a loss of momentum, this growth
rate primarily reflected heightened demand for Sodexo's
integrated Quality of Life Services offers in all geographic
regions. These offers include a significant facilities
management component, which lessened the effect of
lower foodservices volumes resulting from headcount
reductions and other cost-saving measures undertaken
by clients, particularly in Europe

Organic growth for the Benefits and Rewards Services
activity was 9.5%, reflecting further double-digit growth
in Latin America - despite a slowdown in Brazil in the
second half of the year - and a healthy increase in
revenues in Asia.

3.1.2.3 OPERATING PROFIT

Reported operating profit amounted to 1,143 million euro,
an increase of 21.7% at current currencies and 15.1%
excluding currency effects.

Note that Fiscal 2014 reported operating profit was stated
net of 27 million euro in exceptional costs related to the
program to improve operational efficiency and reduce
costs. Based on Fiscal 2014 operating profit before
these exceptional costs, year-on-year growth was
18.3% at current exchange rates and 11.9% excluding
currency effects, while operating margin was 5.8%
compared to 5.4% in Fiscal 2014. This performance was
better than the objective of 10% growth in operating profit
announced by the Group in November 2014.

--- Page 7 ---

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Fiscal 2015 Activity Report

All of the On-site Services geographic regions
contributed to the high overall rate of growth, with
operating profit increases of:

e 39.4% in North America (18.7% at constant
currencies);

e 42.4% in the United Kingdom and Ireland (28.8% at
constant currencies);

e 15% in the Rest of the World (Latin America, Middle
East, Asia, Africa, Australia and Remote Sites) (7.1%
at constant currencies);

e 3% in Continental Europe (3.9% at constant
currencies).

In Benefits and Rewards Services, higher issue volumes
and tight control over costs drove a 15.3% increase in
operating profit excluding currency effects and 6.3% at
current exchange rates

This performance also reflected the benefits over a full
year of the program to improve operational efficiency
and reduce costs, which generated annual savings of
170 million euro compared to the Fiscal 2013 baseline
This program, which was launched in September 2012
and completed in February 2014, focused on reducing
both on-site operating expenses and overheads. The
exceptional expenses recorded during the implementation
period consisted mainly of i) the net cost of withdrawing
from certain unprofitable contracts or activities and ti)
restructuring costs and costs related to various measures
to reduce administrative expenses in many countries
around the world.

3.1.2.4 FINANCE INCOME
AND EXPENSE, NET

Finance income and expense represented a net expense of
107 million euro, reflecting a 66 million euro improvement
compared to Fiscal 2014.

Net borrowing costs decreased by nearly 13 million euro,
following the refinancing operations carried out during
Fiscal 2014.

In addition, the sale of the Group's interest in a special
purpose entity set up in connection with a Private Finance

Initiative (Public-Private Partnership) in the United
Kingdom had a 23 million euro favorable impact on net
finance expense for the year.

3.1.2.5 INCOME TAX EXPENSE

Income tax expense amounted to 320 million euro in
Fiscal 2015. The 55 million euro increase compared to
the prior year was due to the increase in pre-tax profit.
The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2015 was exceptionally
low at 31.1%, due in particular to the use of previously
unrecognized tax loss carry-forwards

3.1.2.6 GROUP NET INCOME
AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

The solid increase in operating profit, both before and after
taking into account the exceptional expenses recorded in
Fiscal 2014, the reduction in net finance expense and the
low effective tax rate combined to drive a 42.9% increase
in Group net income (32.4% excluding currency effects),
to 700 million euro.

Earnings per share totaled 4.60 euro compared to
3.23 euro in Fiscal 2014, representing an increase of
42.4% (32.2% excluding currency effects) in line with
the growth in Group net income

3.1.2.7 PROPOSED DIVIDEND

At the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting to be held
on January 26, 2016, the Board of Directors will
recommend paying a dividend of 2.20 euro per share”)
for Fiscal 2015, an increase of 22.2% over the prior year.
This proposal is in line with Sodexo’s policy of allowing
shareholders to benefit from the increase in Group net
income; it also reflects the Board’s great confidence in
the Group's future and takes into consideration Sodexo’s
solid cash-generating financial model. The proposed
dividend represents a payout ratio of 50% of Group net
income.

Furthermore, confident in the future while maintaining the
financial flexibility needed to invest in future development,
the Board has also decided to implement a 300 million

in the United States at the end of Fiscal 2014. Sodexo
nonetheless successfully leveraged its expertise in this
segment, and continued to enjoy strong growth in Latin
America, especially Brazil, as well as in China.

Education segment revenues were down 0.7% based ona
comparable consolidation scope and at constant currency
exchange rates. The decline was partly due to the Group's
decision to withdraw from a contract with Detroit Public
Schools in North America, in light of the city’s financial
difficulties, and reflected the more selective approach to
new business in Europe. In contrast, Education revenues
in emerging markets grew over the year, lifted by Sodexo’s
global expertise in this client segment.

The Group’s key growth indicators were as follows:

e 93.1% client retention rate, little changed from
Fiscal 2014. The retention rate remained very high in
the United Kingdom and Ireland but declined slightly
in other geographic regions;

e 2.2% growth for existing sites, compared to 2.5%
for the prior year. Foodservices volumes continued to

on growth;

OPERATING PROFIT

Operating profit from On-site Services was 992 million
euro, up 24.8% (13.2% excluding currency effects) over
the prior year. Sodexo made gains in all geographic
regions, with operating profit up 39.4% in North America
(18.7% excluding currency effects), 42.4% in the United

with the House of Representatives, Chevron and Zurich

In the Health Care and Seniors segment, revenue
increased by just 1.1%, due to the adverse impact during
most of the year of Sodexo’s withdrawal in the prior year
from part of the HCR ManorCare contract, and of the
sale of certain laundry activities. However, new contracts
won with clients such as Vidant Health and Tenet Health
System, and faster growth at existing sites confirmed

the latter part of the year. Other contract wins included
LHP Hospital Group (Texas), Erlanger Health System
(Tennessee), Avalon Woodland Park Rehab and Care Center
(Utah) and UMass Memorial Medical Center (3 sites in
Massachusetts).

In Education, the 0.6% decline in revenue reflected mixed
trends, with the increase in sales of full board meal plans
to universities partially offset by the voluntary withdrawal
from a contract with Detroit Public Schools at the end of
the prior fiscal year, due to the city’s financial difficulties
and the risk of non-payment. In the schools segment,
growth in existing site revenues reflected changes in
students’ eating habits in response to the recently enacted
Healthy and Hunger Free Kids Act (HHFKA). Following
disappointing sales performances and contract wins in
Fiscal 2015, a series of measures to improve the sales
teams’ efficiency was decided at the end of the year.
Recent contract wins included Dakota State University,
San Francisco State University and State University of
New York at Stony Brook.

Operating profit

Operating profit totaled 499 million euro, an increase
of 39.4% (18.7% excluding currency effects) compared
to Fiscal 2014.

Numerous productivity improvement measures paid off
in Fiscal 2015 thanks to the systematic deployment of
standardized on-site contract management methods,
particularly in the Education segment, leading to
improved management of the effects of inflation. Off-site
administrative cost efficiencies also contributed to this
good performance. In all, these two factors accounted for
40% of the increase in Fiscal 2015 operating profit, with
the other 60% attributable to the low basis of comparison
in Fiscal 2014 when operating profit was temporarily
affected by problems in deploying the HCR ManorCare
contract and by the provisions set aside for doubtful
receivables and risks on certain contracts

Boosted by all of these factors, operating margin in North
America rose to 6.3% from 5.3% in Fiscal 2014.

e these effects were offset by sustained demand for

among them Carlsberg and Johnson & Johnson, also
acted as a growth driver.

New contracts signed during the year included /nstitut
Pasteur and GE Power Conversion in France, and the
National Police Service in the Netherlands.

The 3.4% contraction in Health Care and Seniors
revenues was mainly due to lower client retention rates,
especially in France, and limited business development
in recent quarters. These markets continue to offer
considerable medium-term growth potential despite
the current economic and political environment. The
transition to an organization by global client segment
currently in progress should enable the Group to leverage
its expertise and deep understanding of its clients and
consumers, in order to steadily improve the effectiveness
of its sales initiatives

New contracts signed during the year included Ospedale
San Matteo Pavia in Italy and Forcilles Hospital in France

In Education, the 2.3% decline in revenue was mainly

a result of budget cuts for schools. Sodexo nonetheless

Many contracts were signed in emerging markets,
including JBS, Valeo, FMC Technologies and Braskem in
Brazil, Vodafone and Adobe in India, and deployment of
the Unilever contract in Asia began during the year.

|n Health Care and Seniors, organic growth of 20.2% was
attributable to contract wins in Latin America, especially
in Brazil., and strong growth in Asia. Driven by Sodexo’s
expertise in Health Care and Seniors services, this steady,
sustained growth confirms the of the Group's global
approach by client segment. During the year, Sodexo won
a number of contracts including for the Mater Dei Belo
Horizonte hospital in Brazil, and Rumah Sakit Pondok
Indah Hospital in Indonesia.

United Kingdom and Ireland

In Education, the 4% organic growth in revenue was
primarily attributable to operations in Latin America,
India and China. New contracts signed during the year
included Nord Anglia International School in Hong Kong
and Sri Utama Schools in Malaysia

Operating profit

Operating profit in the Rest of the World region increased
by 15% (7.1% excluding currency effects) to 161 million
euro. Operating margin was 4.6% compared to 4.2%
in the prior year, maintaining the pattern of growth
established over the last two fiscal years. The further
improvement was the result of major productivity gains
achieved in most of the countries in the region, and also
reflected the impact of additional one-off projects in the
offshore sector.

Revenues in the United Kingdom and Ireland totaled
1.8 billion euro, an increase of 23.5% over Fiscal 2014
including organic growth of 12.8%

Corporate Services revenue growth accelerated sharply
to 13.9%. This performance was attributable to the
provision of services, including for one-off projects with
alarge facilities management component, for clients such
as GSK, Rexam, Carlsberg and Zurich. It also reflects the
initial months’ revenue from a contract awarded to Sodexo
in six regions under the UK government's Transforming
Rehabilitation program to help prepare prison inmates for
a successful return to mainstream society.

Another highlight of Fiscal 2015 was the contract with
Diageo to provide an array of integrated Quality of Life
Services at 68 sites in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

In Health Care and Seniors, organic growth accelerated to
12.7% thanks to the ramp-up of several contracts and the
extension of services provided to several hospitals such as
the five in London operated by Imperial College Healthcare.

In Education, the 4.1% growth in revenues for the year
was principally due to the contract with the prestigious
University College London won in Fiscal 2014

Operating profit

Operating profit increased to 94 million euro, up 42.4%
or 28.8% excluding currency effects. The increase was
partly attributable to the leverage provided by revenue
growth but it also reflected improved margins on several
major integrated services contracts that were still in
the start-up phase in Fiscal 2014. Operating margin
increased from 4.5% in Fiscal 2014 to 5.1%

In the Benefits and Rewards Services activity, the
growth dynamic remained satisfactory in emerging
markets (Latin America and Asia), despite the gradual
but nonetheless significant economic slowdown observed
in Latin America. This trend was illustrated by the 9.5%
organic revenue growth for Fiscal 2015.

Digital-based issue volume accounted for 65% of total
issue volume for the year, reflecting the strong innovation
culture that prevails at Sodexo and underpins the service
offer for clients.

In Latin America, organic growth continued at a
satisfactory rate of 11.1% for issue volume and 14.4%
for revenues, led mainly by solid advances in Brazil and
Venezuela. This performance was supported by higher
face values on vouchers and cards and rising interest
rates in Brazil. Sodexo continued to deepen its market
penetration, thanks to its relevant service offers, and
continued development of its expense management
activities. Contract wins included Hospital Santa Paula
and CEFOR Seguranca Privada in Brazil, and Municipio de
Xochitepec Morelos in Mexico.

In Europe and Asia, organic growth accelerated to 4.3%
for issue volume and 3.8% for revenues. These gains
reflected the success of Sodexo’s Quality of Life offers,

double-digit growth in Turkey, India and China, and more
encouraging growth rates in the rest of Europe.

Contract wins included Hindustan Zinc Limited and
Willis Processing in India, Régie nationale des Tabacs et
Allumettes in Tunisia, Kiloutou in France and Vitaldent
in Spain

Operating profit

Operating profit amounted to 285 million euro, up
6.3% compared to the prior year (15.3% excluding
currency effects). The increase reflected higher issue
volumes and tight operating cost management with a
particular focus on voucher and card processing costs.
The Group continued to invest in research, innovation
and development of Quality of Life Services during the
year, while also launching operations in four new countries
(Portugal, Panama, Singapore and Taiwan) at the end of
the fiscal year.

Excluding the effect of changes in the exchange rates used
to translate operating profit generated in Venezuela”,
operating margin was 34.5%, stable compared to
Fiscal 2014.

(1) Starting in mid-July 2015, Sodexo decided to transition to the new SIMADI foreign exchange platform and started bidding for U.S. dollars
on this platform. The Group therefore considers that the currency exchange rate observed on the SIMADI on August 28, 2015 corresponds
to the rate at which funds from its Venezuelan operations could be repatriated at the period end. Consequently, the exchange rate used
for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 is 7 dollar = 198.96 bolivars (1 euro = 223.14 bolivars). Use of this rate had the effect of

reducing operating profit for the year by 13 million euro.

(726) 1,408

Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to
1,017 million euro, representing some 200 million euro
or 23% more than in Fiscal 2014. This good performance
was mainly due to the sharp 203 million euro rise in
operating profit from fully consolidated companies, part
of which was attributable to the favorable currency effect.

The change in working capital, which had a more limited
positive effect than in the prior year, reflected two opposing
developments, with an increase in trade receivables in
North America and Latin America that was partly offset
by significant client advances related to the Rugby World
Cup in the United Kingdom.

Net cash used in investing activities increased to
378 million euro and included

e net capital expenditure and client investments for
346 million euro, representing approximately 1.8%
of revenues;

e acquisitions of companies for 49 million euro,
corresponding for the most part to the November 2014
acquisition of Motivcom, a leading provider of employee
motivation and recognition services for companies in
the United Kingdom.

Net cash from financing activities, representing a negative
1,365 million euro, and net cash and cash equivalents
were significantly affected by the 1,048 million euro in
debt repayments carried out during the year, including the
880 million bond issue redeemed in January 2015. Net
cash used in financing activities also included dividends
paid by Sodexo SA (in February 2015 in the amount of
276 million euro).

As of August 31, 2015, favorable currency effects (mainly
due to the U.S. dollar and the UK pound sterling against
the euro), partly offset by unfavorable currency effects
(related to the Brazilian real), led to an overall increase
in all statement of financial position items compared to
August 31, 2014

As of August 31, 2015, the Group had total borrowings
of 3,047 million euro. The main borrowings are two euro-
denominated bond issues for a total of 1,100 million
euro and three U.S. private placements for a total of
2,060 million U.S. dollars. The remaining balance includes
various bank loans and facilities, capital leases and

As of August 31, 2015, net debt was 339 million euro,
representing 9% of shareholders’ equity, compared
to 12% as of August 31, 2014. This extremely sound
financial position allows the Board of Directors to propose
to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting a 22.2% increase
in the dividend, to 2.20 euro, and a 300 million euro
share repurchase and cancellation program, representing
the equivalent of 2.4% of the capital, while retaining
the necessary financial flexibility to invest in future
development.

As of August 31, 2015, the Group had unused bank credit
facilities of 1,100 million euro.

The average interest rate on borrowings was 3.8% as of
August 31, 2015. The reduction compared to the prior
year-end was due to the redemption of the 880 million
euro bond issue, which paid interest at an average rate
of 5.9%, and the repayment of borrowings denominated
in Brazilian reals.

On November 17, 2015, the Board of Directors decided to launch a share repurchase and cancellation program for an
amount of 300 million euro, which will be realized over a 12-month period

3.1.5 OUTLOOK

At the November 17, 2015 meeting of the Board of
Directors, Michel Landel, Chief Executive Officer, reminded
the Board of the relevance of the Group’s long-term
strategy, built on its unique integrated Quality of Life
Services offer, its unparalleled global network and its
uncontested leadership position in emerging countries

During the meeting, Michel Landel also discussed the
profound changes the world is currently undergoing,
sources of opportunity for long-term growth for the
Group. Sodexo’s future success will depend on its ability
to convert these changes into opportunities to create value
as an even more agile, innovative and flexible partner.

Sodexo is starting Fiscal 2016 in a highly volatile global
economy: with low forecasted GDP growth in the short-
term in developing economies, in particular in Brazil; oil,
gas and mining sectors strongly affected by the decline
in commodity prices; uncertainty surrounding currency
trends; and a halting recovery in Europe

Faced with these short-term challenges, the Chief
Executive Officer confirms that his Executive Committee is
reinforcing the measures needed to adapt. In Fiscal 2016,
the Group will continue to pursue its efforts for
simplification and standardization, notably through
the following efforts

e reinforced adaptation of operating costs on site;
e simplification of the organization; and

e greater pooling of Group expertise on an international
scale in both operations and support functions

The measures taken will progressively generate annual

savings of around 200 million euro, between now and

Fiscal 2018, when the full benefit will be realized. The

implementation of certain of these initiatives will result

in exceptional costs over the next 18 months, which are
estimated at 200 million euro.

For these reasons, the Group has set the following
objectives for Fiscal 2016:

e organic revenue growth of around 3%; and

e growth in operating profit excluding currency
effects and before exceptional items of around 8%.

In the medium-term, the Group's growth will be supported
by several major trends.

Outsourcing of services by clients in both the private
and public sectors continues to represent outstanding
growth potential in all markets and geographic regions
The potential for further outsourcing remains significant,
particularly in client segments such as Health Care,
Seniors, Education, Defense and Justice. At the same time,
our clients are increasingly demanding integrated services
performed by a reduced number of contractors, thereby
offering additional growth opportunities for the Group

“Seniorization” of populations throughout the world —
By 2025, the population over 65 will have doubled to
800 million people worldwide. This trend combined with
urbanization will lead to exponential growth in the market
for senior care services in the home, in a hospital or an
assisted living facility.

Robotics — New technologies can contribute to automating
the Group's processes and services, but the human factor
remains essential to consumers’ quality of life, throughout
the world

Digital - the Group will take advantage of digital
technologies which today are revolutionizing the world
and transforming relations between Sodexo and its
consumers.

1 38 Sodexo - Fiscal 2015 Registration Document


--- Page 18 ---

In this context, the Group has committed to a
reorganization whose progressive deployment started
September 1, 2015. Sodexo will evolve from a company
organized by country to an organization by client
segment. This will allow the Group to continue to deepen
its knowledge of consumer expectations in the area of
quality of life specific to each segment, and to standardize
and pool its expertise thanks to the implementation of
operational platforms. This new organization will create
enhanced value for Sodexo’s clients and consumers, and
will thus allow the Group to progressively accelerate
growth.
