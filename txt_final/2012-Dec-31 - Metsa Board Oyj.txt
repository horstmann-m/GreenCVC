CEO'S REVIEW

The year 2012 was a very important milestone
for our company. The strategic review that was
initiated in 2006 to transform our company
from Europe’s largest fine paper producer
into the leading fresh forest fibre paperboard
company was successfully finalized. The final
measures were the closure of the Alizay mill in
France and the discontinuation of the unprof-
itable businesses at the Gohrsmiihle mill in
Germany. As part of the transformation
process, the company’s business name was
changed from M-real Corporation to Metsa
Board Corporation. The new name and
identity have been well received by our stake-

holders.

PROFITABLE GROWTH OF THE
PAPERBOARD BUSINESS CONTINUES,
In late 2012, the EUR 120 million investment
programme was completed when the bio-
power plant at our Kyro mill was commis-
sioned. As part of the programme we have
increased our annual folding boxboard capac-
ity from 785,000 tonnes to 935,000 tonnes.
The new capacity will be fully available from
early 2013 onwards. The share of modern
folding boxboard of all consumer packaging
raw materials is still rather low globally, espe-
cially outside Europe. We will do our utmost
to replace the traditional less ecological pack-
aging materials with our safe and ecological
folding boxboards that is an excellent way for
consumer goods companies to improve the
sustainability of their operations. We will
focus even more on cooperation with our
customers in North America and Asia to
strengthen our position in these big markets.

We will secure the availability of folding
boxboard in order to support successfully our
customers’ growth, There is still very good
potential to increase the capacity of our cur-
rent folding boxboard machines with moder-
ate investments. Our pulp self-sufficiency
continues at a very high level which is an
essential factor in meeting the growth
potential.

Another important part of the investment

programme was the upgrading of the coating
section at the Kemi linerboard machine in
Finland. In early 2012, we launched the new

double coated white top linerboards, which
has been a great success. We will gradually
increase the share of coated grades in the
Kemi mill’s linerboard production.

GOOD PROFITABILITY TREND IN 2012 BUT

THE FULL POTENTIAL NOT REALIZED YET

The year 2012 started in a rather uncertain
macroeconomic situation and our results were
curtailed by the paperboard inventory reduc-
tion in the delivery chain. Towards the sum-
mer the situation improved as expected and
paperboard operating rates normalized.

The profitability of our company improved at
a similar pace. The efficiencies of the rebuilt
paperboard machines developed well and
month after month we had more capacity
available. The demand in the main end uses of
our paperboard, such as food, cigarette, phar-
maceuticals and cosmetics, is stable by nature.
All in all, the demand outlook for our paper-
boards continue to be very solid both in
Europe and outside Europe.

As planned, the losses from the paper and
market pulp units that were closed or restruc-
tured were reduced in 2012. It is expected that
the measures in several countries and mills to

eliminate losses will improve our annual oper-
ating results by approximately EUR 110 mil-
lion in comparison to actual performance in
2011. This was realized mostly already in 2012
and the remaining losses are expected to be
eliminated from the beginning of 2013.

STRONG FUTURE AS A PAPERBOARD
FOCUSED COMPANY
Today, Metsa Board is very heavily focused on
fresh forest fibre paperboard. Our current
paper and market pulp operations are good
cash generators for developing our paperboard
business further. We have one standard paper
mill left, Husum in Sweden, which is the
largest unit in its field in Europe and definitely
among the most competitive. We continue to
be interested in participating the European-
wide paper industry consolidation.
Sustainability and corporate responsibility
are at the very core of all of our operations.
Our business is run according to the principles

of the United Nations Global Compact in the
areas of human rights, labour, the environ-
ment and anti-corruption. Work to develop
our products in an even more ecological and
safe continues together with our customers.
We are also constantly searching for new ways
to minimize the adverse environmental
impacts of our operations.

HEAVILY
FOCUSED

ON FRESH
FOREST FIBRE
PAPERBOARD.

It seems that 2013 will be characterized by
uncertainties in the general economy. The
successful transformation from a fine paper
company into a paperboard company has,
however, stabilized our business materially.
Our balance sheet has also been strengthened
considerably. We are capable of succeeding in
all macroeconomic situations. As a fresh forest
fibre paperboard focused company, I am con-
vinced that we have the prerequisites to be the
most profitable company in our field in
Europe. The main factors contributing to the
improvement of our result making further in
the future are the full utilisation of the

expanded folding boxboard capacity ani
further productivity and cost improvements
in all operations. We actively develop new
products and innovations in our paperboard
business.

I thank all our employees, owners, cus-
tomers and other stakeholders for the year
2012. Together we can develop our business
even more successfully in the future.

PAPERBOARD
O P E R AT | N G The outlook for ecological and safe paperboards is very good.
E N V | R O N M E N T ‘The share of modern folding boxboard is still rather low globally,

especially outside Europe. Currently, folding boxboard accounts for

about a third in Europe, a fifth in Asia and only a couple of per cents
in North America of the total consumer packaging paperboard consumption. Safe
and ecological folding boxboards offers consumer goods companies an excellent way
to improve their sustainability globally. As the global economic situation is changing,
changes in the inventory levels in different parts of the supply chain are affecting
short-term delivery volumes. In 2012, the global economy continued to be weak,
and customers exercised caution in inventory management. It is forecast by several
external institutions that delivery volumes will grow nicely in the coming years.

Mineral oil residues from printing ink in recycled fibre board continue to be a
central issue. The concern that mineral oils would be transferred from packaging to
foodstuffs themselves has increased interest in fresh forest fibre based paperboard.

In China, the paperboard capacity has grown considerably in recent years. The
new capacity is needed to satisfy the growing demand in China and its neighbouring
areas, It is not expected that the Chinese capacity would challenge Metsa Board’s
main products, high quality and ecological consumer packaging paperboards for

demanding end-uses.

PAPER
Restructuring of the paper market combined with the weak global
economic situation created a challenging situation for paper

suppliers in 2012. New media and information technology are
increasingly competing with the traditional printed media.

PAPERBOARD
HAS AVERY

GOOD FUTURE
OUTLOOK.

‘The uncertain economic situation in Europe has weakened companies’ confi-
dence and resulted in cost savings. Advertising cost cuts and increasing unemploy-
ment have reduced demand for paper. Demand for uncoated fine paper has
decreased slightly, but the demand decline in graphic papers has continued to be
strong.

‘The paper industry has prepared for the changing environment by shutting
down capacity, which is why the utilisation rates of uncoated fine paper mills were
in 2012 higher than in the previous year. Average price of uncoated fine paper
decreased slightly in 2012.

NN

PULP
Year 2012 was challenging for the pulp industry as well. At the

beginning of the year, prices started to increase, then took a down-
ward turn in the summer and started to increase again in the last

quarter of the year. The price increase at the end of the year was
mainly due to low inventory levels, the seasonal increase in paper demand and a
weaker US dollar. China is the leading driver of demand growth.

The market situation of short-fibre pulp was better than that of long-fibre pulp
and the market price gap of the two pulp grades narrowed. Nevertheless, the out-
look in the long-fibre pulp market is better than that of short fibre pulp where
clearly more capacity will enter the market in the future.

Demand for fresh forest fibre was strengthened by problems in the availability
of recycled fibre and its better product safety in food packaging.

Some high yield pulp capacity is about to be closed, which has improved market
balance.

SUPERIOR PRINTABILITY
WITH KEMIART KRAFTLINERS

METSA BOARD'S KEMIART KRAFTLINERS
ENABLE LIGHTWEIGHTING AND SMOOTH
RUNNING ON CORRUGATORS AND IN PRINTING.

Metsa Board launched successfully new double coated Kemiart Graph+ and Kemiart Lite+
grades in the beginning of 2012, following a rebuild of the coating section and installation of a
second coating unit at the Kemi mill in Finland. Kemiart Ultra completes the coated product
range, which includes a suitable coated liner for each printing method.

The double coating provides a smoother and glossier surface, enhancing printability with
improved ink laydown, brighter colours and more accurate detail. The new grades are ideal for
retail-ready packaging, point-of-sale and promotional displays and other high-end packaging
applications and they have been well received in the market.

Metsa Board's kraftliners are made of fresh forest fibres which ensure an excellent
consistency for smooth running on corrugators and printing. Despite of their light weight, the
liners are strong and flexible enabling the use of lower weight grades. That again, lowers the

converter’s production costs and improves sustainability. Kraftliners also provide excellent
folding endurance compared to materials that are based on recycled elements.

The EUR 120 million investment programme
in the paperboard business was successfully
completed in 2012. The goal of the pro-
gramme was to increase the availability of
products and improve service. The paperboard
machine rebuildings included in the pro-
gramme were completed at the Aanekoski mill
in 2012 and at the Kyro and Simpele mills in
2011. The investment programme also
included the implementation of double-coat-
ing at the Kemi linerboard mill as well as the
biopower plant constructed at the Kyro mill,
which was commissioned in the autumn of
2012.
In 2011 and 2012, Metsa Board increased
its folding boxboard capacity by a total of
150,000 annual tonnes. In accordance with
the original goal, the new capacity will be fully
available from early 2013.

The sheeting capacity of folding boxboard
has also been increased to meet the increased

customer needs. The new sheeting plant at the
Aanekoski mill increased the mill's sheeting
capacity to 70,000 tonnes per year. A new
Express Board service for fast deliveries was
established at the Gohrsmithle mill, with a

sheeting capacity of 60,000 tonnes per year.
Certain folding boxboard sales and pro-
duction resources were reallocated during the
year in accordance with the strategy.
The unprofitable operations of the
Gohrsmithle mill were discontinued in 2012.

The Chromolux speciality paper and paper-
board operations will continue at the mill.
Measures to create a business park concept in

Gohrsmiihle continue in collaboration with
employee representatives in order to create
new jobs in the mill site.

The focus of the linerboard business on
coated grades has proven successful, and the
demand for the new double-coated kraftliners
introduced at the beginning of the year has
been good.

Prices of coated white top kraftliners were
successfully increased in 2012. No significant
changes occured in the prices of folding box-
boards. The prices of wallpaper base and
Chromolux products were stable.

In 2012, the profitability was weakened by
the lower share of Metsa Fibre results, due to

lower pulp price and reduced holding in the
company.

GOOD DEMAND OUTLOOK FOR PAPERBOARD
Metsa Board strongly focuses on ecological
and safe fresh forest fibre paperboard with a
good outlook for demand growth. Paperboard
has end uses in people’s everyday life, and their
demand is naturally stable. Safe and ecological
folding boxboards offer consumer goods
companies an excellent way to improve their
sustainability globally.

The most important goal in 2013 is to
fully use the additional 150,000-tonne capac-
ity, which will be used to support the global
growth of existing customers among others.
Metsa Board will have good opportunities to
further increase the capacity of its current
folding boxboard and linerboard machines.

IMPROVED EFFICIENCY
AT THE HUSUM MILL

AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS REACHING
THE FULL PRODUCTION POTENTIAL OF
THE HUSUM MILL WAS TAKEN IN 2012.

Metsda Board’s Husum mill in Sweden is the largest integrated fine paper and pulp mill in Europe
which annual production capacity is currently over 800,000 tonnes of paper and 750,000 tonnes
of pulp. The mill's competitiveness is mainly attributable to its large size but also to its efficient

operations. In 2012, the efficiency and productivity at the paper mill was increased further by
developing the existing machine and operation base

During the annual mill shut, a new reeler on PM6 and a new unwind reeler on Winder 8 were
installed, enabling use of the same reel spools for PM6, PM8 and the coater. Also a minor rebuild
was done at the drying section on PM8. As a result of these minor investments and a major
re-engineering of the production planning the production of different basis weights can be better
focused on selected paper machines. PM6 and PM8 produce both office paper products and
base papers for the coater. Thanks to these changes the grade switches reduce and a material
amount of additional production volume potential is released.

‘The strategic review of the paper business,
launched in 2006, was completed successfully
in 2012.

In recent years, Metsa Board has made
considerable investments in the production
and cost-effectiveness of its remaining paper
units. Paper manufacturing has been central-
ised to the Husum mill in Sweden. The mill's
paper and pulp capacity has been maximised
to 1.6 million tonnes per year without addi-
tional investments.

Sales volumes of the high yield pulp
(BCTMP) have increased and have been
targeted to long-term contract customers in
Europe. The mill is a good reserve for Metsa
Board for growing the paperboard business in
the future.

In spring 2012, a voluntary reindustrialisa-
tion project was launched in Alizay together
with Metsa Board, employee representatives
and local authorities. As a result of the project,
Metsa Board divested the Alizay mill site,
including the equipment and buildings, to
Conseil General de I'Eure, representing the
French government, in January 2013.

In accordance with its strategy, Metsa
Board reduced its pulp surplus by selling a 7.3
percentage point shareholding in Metsa Fibre
to Japanese Itochu Corporation. After the
completion of the arrangement, Metsa Board’s
annual pulp net surplus decreased from
approximately 0.5 million tonnes to 0.3 mil-

lion tonnes. Metsa Board's shareholding in
Metsa Fibre is now 24.9 per cent.

In 2012, the result was improved by con-
siderably lower losses of the units closed and
restructured as well as increased pulp deliver-
ies. The result was weakened by the reduced
prices of pulp and office papers as well as the
strengthening of the Swedish krona.

SMALLER BUT HEALTHIER PAPER BUSINESS
Metsa Board's papers are primarily sold to the
Western European market, where overall
paper demand is estimated to decrease and the
overcapacity situation to continue and, in
many grades, worsen. Situation in uncoated
fine paper is better than in other paper grades.
The overall situation in paper manufacturing
in Europe will require structural changes in
the future.

Demand for pulp was reasonably strong in
2012, and the global demand and supply
situation is estimated to continue to be good
in long-fibre pulp, in particular. Overall,
demand for pulp will decrease in Europe and
increase in the emerging markets.

After considerable restructuring and
successful divestments, Metsa Board now has
aconsiderably smaller but materially healthier
paper business, which is developed in parallel
to the paperboard business. The smaller size
provides opportunities to operate flexibly in

and a safe working environment for all indivi-
duals as well as prohibits corruption and
bribery. The supplier should ensure that its
subcontractors also comply with the require-
ments.

The Supplier Code of Conduct is an
integral part of any agreement documentation
and has been taken into account in all new
and renewed contracts during 2012.

KNOWING THE ORIGIN OF WOOD RAW MATERIAL,
All the wood used by Metsa Board comes
from sustainably managed commercial forests.
Regardless of whether the wood originates
from certified or non-certified forests, its
origin is always known. The wood’s origin can
be traced by a Chain of Custody management
system operated by Metsa Group’s wood
procurement organisation. The wood origin
tracing system is in relation to the require-
ments of the EU Timber Regulation.

In 2012, Mets& Group defined five main
environmental targets for wood supply: main-
taining biodiversity, decreasing the impacts to

water, decreasing operations’ emissions, ensur-
ing legal wood supply and ensuring the knowl-
edge of its personnel and contractors. These
targets were brought into practice via the
Environmental Programmes of each country.
The action plans included training, rationalis-
ing transportation and further developing
internal control and instructions.

The majority of wood used by Metsa
Board in Finland comes from forests owned
by Metsaliitto Cooperative’s members. The
company’s other wood procurement countries
in 2012 were Sweden, Latvia, Russia, Estonia,
Lithuania and Norway. Metsa Group has been
one of the pioneers in developing wood origin
tracing systems in Russia.

All Metsa Board’s mills have both PEFC*
and FSC’ certifications. During 2012, 4.8
million cubic metres of wood was used by
Metsa Board’s mills, of which 64 per cent was
from certified forests.

During the year, Metsa Board used
approximately 1.3 million tonnes of various
types of pulp, of which 1.2 million tonnes
were produced by Metsa Board's own mills.
Through its holding in Metsa Fibre, Metsa
Board had access to 0.6 million tonnes of
chemical pulp. Some 0.1 million tonnes of
various types of pulp were bought from exter-
nal suppliers and 0.5 million tonnes were sold
outside the company. Metsa Board requires its
pulp suppliers to comply with legislation as
well as annually report the origin of the wood,
forest certification and environmental data.

SUSTAINABLE
CHOICES

16 SUSTAINABILITY —

Consumers are increasingly interested in the
sustainability throughout the supply chain of
the products they purchase. Metsa Board’s
lightweight paperboards and papers consume
less raw materials and have fewer environmen-
tal effects in production and transport, as well
as generating less waste than average.

Metsa Board’s business development is
based on customer-oriented packaging solu-
tions, creating added value for customers, as
well as Super Productivity, i.e. superior prod-
uct and production efficiency.

In 2012, anew R&D Centre focusing on
the research and development of paperboards,
raw materials and printing was established in
Aanekoski. The objective of the centre is to
support customers by means of product devel-
opment and innovation, to survey applications
based on new raw materials, and to ensure that
Metsa Board’s paperboard products continue
to suit the rapidly developing printing and
processing methods.

Mets Board's R&D costs remained at the
previous year's level in 2012, amounting to
approximately EUR 5 million, or 0.2 per cent
of sales. The company has invested heavily in
improvements in the quality and efficiency of
products and production machinery, which is
not included in the items categorised as
research and development in accounting.

SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING

Metsa Board’s products are safe throughout
their life cycles. The traceability of raw materi-
als is especially important in paperboards that
are in contact with food. Metsa Board knows

the origin of all the main raw materials, wood,
pulp and chemicals it uses.

The requirements and regulations for
materials in contact with food are only a
starting point. Metsa Board’s products meet
even the strictest international standards and
often surpass the requirements of national
legislation. Metsa Board’s paperboards do not
contain compounds that are harmful, such as
mineral oils.

The fresh forest fibre Metsa Board uses in

its paperboards is a premium raw material:
it is highly functional, light and strong, while
also being cleaner than recycled fibre. The

Metsa Board's folding
boxboards are safe in food
packaging. They are made

of fresh forest fibres, which are by
nature of very high purity. Mineral
oils or other harmful compounds
are not transferred from packaging
to foodstuffs.

lightweight of the board reduces emissions
generated by transport, saving both the envi-
ronment and costs. In addition, lightweight
packages generate less waste. At the end of
their life cycle, Metsa Board’s paperboard can
be recycled, burned or composted.

All mills in Metsa Board’s Paperboard
business area have received the international
ISO 22000 food safety certification. Subcon-
tractors are also required to adhere to the
same strict hygiene requirements to ensure
that paperboard is protected against contami-
nation until the end of its life cycle.

Metsa Board does not use genetically
modified trees or GMO starch raw materials.
Metsa Board does not approve of nanotech-
nology-based new substances until sufficient
information regarding their safety becomes
available.

Mets Board continues the active follow-
up and participation in the research to gain
more knowledge about the risks and benefits
related to these issues.

OPEN AND TRANSPARENT DIALOG

Metsa Board knows the environmental
impacts of its products and will increase
understanding of them among its stake-
holders.

Since 2001, Paper Profile environmental
product declarations have been provided for
all Metsa Board’s papers and boards. The
Paper Profile is a standardised tool for paper
and board products to communicate the
environmental performance of the products.

The climate impact for individual prod-
ucts is reported on a customer-specific basis

through carbon footprint calculations. Cur-
rently, as different corporations use different
methods for carbon footprint calculations,
they are not comparable from company to
company. Mets Board has reported carbon
footprint calculations since 2007. The calcula-
tion adheres to the Carbon Footprint Frame-
work for Paper and Board Products developed
by the Confederation of European Paper
Industries, CEPI.

In 2012, Metsa Board’s Paperboard busi-
ness area produced its first Environmental
Product Declaration (EPD) on Simcote, a
folding boxboard product. EPD is a standard-
ised way of quantifying the environmental
impact of a product. EPD is based on Life
Cycle Assessment (LCA) calculations and, as
such, aims to communicate the product’s
potential environmental impacts during its
entire lifetime from cradle to gate. The calcu-
lation is presented in Metsa Group's Sustain-
ability report 2012.

Eco-labels help consumers understand the
environmental impacts of a product. Metsa
Board’s office papers have been granted the
EU Ecolabel for its paper brands. To date, no
such commonly agreed eco-label criteria exist
for packaging products.

In 2012, Metsa Board’s paper products
were acknowledged in the WWF Environ-
mental Paper Awards for listing the majority
of its Uncoated Woodfree Papers in WWF's
database of eco-rated papers, Check Your
Paper.

Metsa Board has been participating in the
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) since 2007.
The CDP is an independent, non-profit
organisation that encourages listed companies
to carry out transparent reporting on green-
house gas emissions and climate change strate-
gies. The CDP has assisted Metsa Board in
setting objectives to reduce emissions and
improve its environmental performance. In
2012, Metsa Board was invited by customers
to participate in the CDP Supply Chain.

In 2011, Mets& Board signed the CEO
Water Mandate initiative which is a joint
venture between the public and private sectors
with the aim to improve the efficiency of and
open reporting on water usage. The first
report was completed in 2012.

Good manufacturing

practice (GMP) secures

product safety at Metsa
Board's production units. For
example forklifts run on liquid gas
or electricity and the paperboards
are not exposed to exhaust gas.

THE SMALLER THE ENVIRONMENTAL

IMPACT THE BETTER

Metsa Board works actively to minimise and
manage all environmental impacts related to
its own and its partners’ operations.

Landfill waste levels at Metsa Board’s
production sites have been considerably
reduced through the efficient re-use of by
products and residues. Sorting mill waste
on-site for use as a raw material or for energy
production as a normal practice increases the
material efficiency and reduces the need for

landfill disposal.

Metsa Board is continuously looking for
new ways to reduce the consumption of fresh
water in its production by re-using water
efficiently. Wastewater is purified carefully
before it is released back to waterways. The
main wastewater impacts are eutrophication
and oxygen demand caused by phosphorus
and nitrogen nutrients and organic matter.
Nevertheless, each mill has its own specific
environmental permit which sets such limits
for pollutants that insignificant harm to the
environment occur.

Metsa Board’s mills are mainly located in
the Nordic countries where there is plenty of
good quality fresh water and forests of native
tree species. Forests play a crucial role in the
region’s natural water cycle. Forests filter and
clean rainwater before it enters the ground-
water system or flows into rivers and lakes thus
maintaining high water quality. Sustainable
forest management helps to preserve a signifi-
cant part of the forested landscape and hence
helps to maintain the services that forests
provide to the ecosystems.

IMPROVEMENTS AT PRODUCTION UNITS

Metsa Board's production units are developed
continuously in order to minimise the envi-
ronmental load and risks.

In 2012, Kyro mill installed a new treat-
ment system for the odorous gases emitted
from the effluent treatment plant. The collec-
tion of odorous gases was also extended to
cover the whole sludge treatment area. Several
improvements were also made at the effluent
treatment process, including the installation
of more efficient aerators in the biological
treatment and extensive maintenance of the

bioreactor. Environmental noise was reduced

with replacement and maintenance of three
exhaust fans. Kaskinen mill installed equip-
ment for screening bottom ash from the
power plant boiler. The screened sand is
re-used as bed material in the fluidised-bed

boiler, reducing the amount of waste signifi-

cantly. Simpele mill was able to reduce noise
by insulating various pieces of equipment.
Environmental risk surveys were updated

at Kyro and Simpele mills. Environmental
authorities have approved the termination
notification of Aanekoski paper mill. Kyro
mill has submitted a renewal for an environ-
mental permit.

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

Metsa Board has environmental liabilities
remaining from earlier operations at industrial
sites that have been closed, sold or leased, and
from landfill sites that are no longer in use.
Metsa Board’s latest actions have related to the
rehabilitation of the Niemenranta area in
Tampere, Finland, for residential and recrea-
tional use. The work on the site began in 2008
and is expected to be completed by autumn
2013.

ENVIRONMENTAL INCIDENTS,
A small number of environmental incidents
were recorded at Mets Board’s mills in 2012.
The permit limit for COD, phosphorous
and nitrogen emissions to water were
exceeded at the Kyro mill between February
and May due to severe operational problems
in wastewater treatment. Several corrective
actions were taken, including new aeration
units in the activated sludge plant, mainte-
nance of the bioreactor and adjustments in the

particles to air from the recovery plant Alrec
were exceeded at the Kaskinen mill in May
and June due to a broken bag filter in the flue
gas treatment. The broken bag filter was
replaced and the flue gas system checked.

Additionally, minor and short-term non-
compliances with environmental permit
requirements were reported at Metsa Board’s
Simpele and Husum mills. The authorities
were informed and corrective actions taken in
all cases.

DEVELOPMENTS IN
ENERGY EFFICIENCY

20 SUSTAINABILITY — 0:

In 2012, Mets Board continued to improve
the energy efficiency of its production pro-
cesses. The improvement work is supported by
the Energy Efficiency Systems that have been
in place since 2009. To be compatible with the
latest standards, all paperboard mills and
Husum mill in Sweden have been granted the
certification for the new ISO 50001 Energy
Management Systems standard. ISO 50001 is
based on the management system model of
continuous improvement also used for other
well-known standards such as ISO 9001 or
ISO 14001.

BIOENERGY
COVERS 55% OF
METSA BOARD'S
TOTAL ENERGY USE.

‘The target of energy efficiency develop-
ment is to reduce the specific energy con-
sumption of manufactured products. In 2012,
Metsa Board started a project to improve the
follow-up of energy efficiency and energy
costs. The new procedure will be implemented
at all mills during 2013.

The main methods to improve energy
efficiency are equipment and process modifi-
cations and optimising operations. Efficiency
improvements are an integral part of all major
investments in production capacity.

New energy efficiency improvement
potentials are continuously studied by con-
ducting energy analyses, cooperating with
equipment manufacturers and developing
procedures internally. As an example, mill
energy analyses were conducted for Kemi mill
in 2012.

In 2012, altogether 11 actions were com-
pleted that reduced electricity consumption
by some 67 GWh and heat by 76 GWh
annually.

FOCUS IN BIOFUELS

During 2012, wood-based bioenergy covered
55 per cent (48% in 2011) of Metsa Board’s
total energy use, which was 12.6 TWh (14.7
TWh). The majority of this bioenergy is
generated by using by-products from Metsa
Board's own production such as bark and
black liquor. The rest is generated from forest
residues originating from wood sourcing. The
majority, 91 per cent, of the total electricity
purchased was CO, neutral. The total pur-
chased electricity consumption was 2.1 TWh
(2.2 TWh).

INVESTING IN

BIOENERGY

A55 MEGAWATT BIOPOWER PLANT, COMMISSIONED AT
THE KYRO MILL, HALVES THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF
THE PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED AT THE MILL.

To increase the already high share of
bioenergy, a new biopower plant was built

at Metsa Board's Kyro mill. Inaugurated in
October 2012, the plant was built together
with Metsa Board and two Finnish energy
companies, Pohjolan Voima and Leppakosken
Sahk6. The new plant produces electricity
and heat and replaces the use of fossil natural
gas at the mill. It also provides heating for the
neighbouring district of Hameenkyré.

The biopower plant utilises wood-based raw
material - mostly bark, whole tree chips,
crushed stumps and other wood fragments
together with other waste materials from
Metsda Group's operations. Carbon dioxide
emissions from the Kyro mill will be reduced
by approximately 100,000 tonnes per year.
The carbon footprints of the folding boxboards
and wallpaper base produced at the mill will
be reduced by half.

INVESTMENTS IN PERSONNELS
WORK CAPACITY AND COMPETENCE

At the end of 2012, the number of Metsa
Board’s employees was 3,279. The number of
employees was 791 lower than the year before.
In 2012, the reorganisation of the paper
ness launched in 2011 was completed. This

usi-

included closing the Alizay mill, discontinu-
ing the unprofitable operations at the
Gohrsmithle and Reflex mills as well as closing
Aanekoski paper machine 2.

At the Gohrsmiihle mill, Metsa Board will
continue Chromolux specialty paper and

paperboard operations and has started folding
boxboard sheeting operations. In addition,
Metsa Board has been developing a so-called

business park concept with various parties
from the city and ministry in order to create
new jobs in the mill site. A good example of
the successful implementation of the business
park concept is the Reflex mill, where Metsa
Board was able to divest business units to
different companies, saving more than 200
jobs. Metsa Board has had no operations at
the Reflex mill since February 2012.
Together with the local authorities, Metsa
Board helped redundant employees find new
jobs. As much as possible, the employees were

offered new positions within the company or
in Mets& Group's other business areas. For
example, number of employees from the
closed paper machine at Aanekoski were
transferred to other Mets Group units.

PROACTIVE WELL-BEING AT WORK

Metsa Board actively cares for the well-being
and work capacity of its personnel, and
addresses risks related to these proactively.
During the year under review, the company
continued to apply the early support model,
implemented the year before, as part of the
unified operating method. The model consists
of operating models for early support and
work capacity evaluation as well as a personal
work capacity plan. The operating model will
generate a more caring working environment
and enable increasingly equal treatment of all
employees.

Personnel surveys are one of Mets Board’s
most important tools in identifying how the
working environment supports personnel in
their daily tasks. Follow-up of measures based
on the personnel survey completed the year

IN KEMI

HEALTHY AT WORK

KEMI MILL STARTED TO
SYSTEMATICALLY PUT AN EARLY
SUPPORT MODEL INTO PRACTICE.

At the end of 2010, Healthy at Work project was launched at Metsa Board's Kemi mill, aiming to
solve issues related to work and well-being at work as early as possible and so prevent severe

problems in personnel work capacity.

Anew operating model was created for the mill in order to identify matters threatening
performance at work, and cooperation was developed with the occupational health services and
insurance companies. The project covered the entire Kemi paperboard and pulp mill integrate, or
approximately 300 people, most of whom work shifts in production

The project, which ended in January 2013, produced the expected results at the mill: sickness
absenteeism was reduced, proactive monitoring of work capacity was activated, and, for
example, the number of job trials increased. In addition, cooperation with insurance companies
became closer, and an early support model was instilled in managerial work. Promoting well-
being at work actively will continue in Kemi even after the end of the project.

before continued at various mills and sales
locations in 2012. Based on the previous
study, the decision was made to ensure oppor-
tunities for the entire personnel to participate
more actively in the development of their
working environment. The next survey, which
will be the third one organised in the com-
pany, is scheduled for early 2013.

Sickness absenteeism and accidents at
work are prevented with proactive actions and
key figures related to them are followed up on
monthly. Supervisors receive support in their
work from local HR organisations. Thanks to

the systematic and persistent work, sickness
absenteeism has decreased considerably (3.9%
in 2012 and 4.6% in 2011). An example of a
successful local project in developing well-
being at work is the Healthy at Work project

completed at the Kemi mill.

SURVEYING AND IMPROVING COMPETENCE
Metsa Board systematically surveys the com-
petence of its personnel. Competence surveys
are based on self-evaluations performed by
employees. Survey results can be used for the
development of unit- and function-specific as
well as personal competence. The competence
survey is an effective and concrete tool for

improving the quality of development discus-
sions, among other things. In 2012, surveys
were completed at the Kemi, Joutseno, Kaski-
nen and Simpele mills, among others.

Taking care of personnel competence is an
essential factor in terms of the success of
investment projects. In the extensive invest-
ment projects carried out at Mets Board, the
development of personnel competence was
supported by machinery and process training
as well as long-term training leading to a
degree.

In 2011, Metsa Board, as part of Metsa
Group, implemented common operating
instructions to ensure that the entire company
adheres to the shared ethical principles. In
2012, studying these operating instructions
continued. Personnel used an online learning
environment to study six key policies (Code
of Conduct, equality policy, personnel policy,
corporate safety policy, information security
policy, and sustainable development princi-
ples). In addition to this, designated target
groups studied policies and Codes of Conduct
central to their own operations.

In 2012, the Simplifier programme focus-
ing on the development of business and
leadership skills of middle management was
organised for the third time. Metsa Board’s

personnel also participated in Metsa Group's
management development programme Chal-
lenger. In addition to these programmes,
Metsi Board conducts other management
coaching programmes, several programmes
leading to vocational degrees and designs
personal development programmes for per-
sonnel.

Metsa Board anticipates future resource
needs by means of retirement forecasts. Based
on these forecasts and personnel competence
surveys, Mets Board develops its recruitment
training to meet future needs. The Production
supervisor and specialist recruitment training
programme organised in 2011-2012 was
aimed at future managers. The programme,
implemented in cooperation with Metsa
Fibre, helped recruit skilled employees for
managerial positions in production and main-
