1 Summary

1.1 Introduction
Full Year 2018 highlights (year ended December 31, 2018)

In Distribution, our travel agency air bookings grew 2.1%, to 580.2 million

In IT Solutions, our passengers boarded increased 11.9%, to 1,853.9 million

Revenue grew by 6.6%", to €4,943.9 million (high single-digit growth rate, excluding foreign exchange
effects)

EBITDA increased by 9.7%’, to €2,040.6 million (high single-digit growth rate’, excluding foreign exchange
and IFRS 16 effects)
Adjusted profit? increased by 1.0%!, to €1,122.8 million

Free Cash Flow amounted to €989.0 million’, representing growth of 7.8%

Net financial debt* was €3,074.0 million at December 31, 2018 (1.47 times last-twelve-month EBITDA‘)

Amadeus continued to evolve positively through the fourth quarter of 2018, delivering 2018 Revenue, EBITDA
and Adjusted Profit growth of 6.6%", 9.7% and 1.0%", respectively (excluding TravelClick related acquisition
transaction costs) *. This result was supported by the operating performances across our Distribution and IT
Solutions segments, as well as by the TravelClick consolidation effect? (acquired on October 4, 2018). Our
reported financial performance in the period was distorted by the USD/Euro exchange rate compared to the
same period last year, which had an important negative impact on our results. Excluding foreign exchange
effects (and also, the IFRS 167 impact on EBITDA), in 2018 Revenue and EBITDA both grew at high single-digit
growth rates’, with a broadly stable EBITDA margin. The slower relative growth in Adjusted Profit in 2018 was
driven by extraordinary positive deferred tax liability adjustments in 2017, excluding which Adjusted Profit
grew 6.0% in the year.

In Distribution, we continued to secure and expand content for our subscribers by renewing or signing
distribution agreements with 15 carriers in the quarter (including Finnair, and TAP), amounting to a total of
50 in 2018. Also, recently, in India, Vistara renewed its distribution agreement with Amadeus and the Indian
low cost carrier SpiceJet, signed its first distribution agreement with Amadeus. In 2018, our Distribution air
volumes increased by 2.1%, impacted by a decelerating industry and Amadeus weak market share
performance in the Western European OTA segment. Market share weakness in Western Europe has
impacted our global competitive position®, which slightly decreased by 0.2 p.p in 2018 to 43.7% (excluding
Western Europe, our competitive position® expanded by 1.1 p.p. in 2018 and by 1.4 p.p. in the fourth quarter).

Including TravelClick’s 2018 consolidation effect of: Revenue, EBITDA and Adjusted Profit contributions of €86.7m, €22.3m and €14.3m,
respectively, while excluding TravelClick’s related acquisition transaction costs, PPA adjustment and bank acquisition financing interest
expense. For full details, please see section 3.2 on TravelClick’s acquisition and impacts. Also, compared to 2017 figures restated for IFRS 15
and IFRS 9, applied from January 1, 2018. See section 3.1 for further details. In addition, we are early adopters of IFRS 16, which we applied
since January 1, 2018. 2017 figures will not be restated for IFRS 16. In 2018, IFRS 16 had a positive €47.4 million impact on EBITDA. See
section 3.1 for further details.

2 Excluding after-tax impact of the following items: (i) accounting effects derived from PPA exercises and impairment losses, (ii) non-operating
exchange gains (losses) and (iii) other non-recurring items.

3 Defined as EBITDA, minus capex, plus changes in our operating working capital, minus taxes paid, minus interests and financial fees paid.
Including TravelClick’s 2018 Free Cash Flow contribution of €14.8m, while excluding TravelClick’s related acquisition transaction costs paid
and TravelClick’s acquisition financing interest paid and related non-recurring fees. For full details, please see section 3.2 on TravelClick’s

Asia and Pacific, as well as North America, were our fastest-growing regions in 2018, expanding at high growth
rates. Over this period, Distribution revenue grew 2.8%", negatively impacted by foreign exchange effects.

IT Solutions revenue grew 13.1%° in 2018, negatively impacted by foreign exchange effects. This evolution
was driven by (i) growth in Airline IT solutions, (ii) a continued expansion in our new businesses and (iii) the
consolidation of TravelClick. In Airline IT, Passengers Boarded increased by 11.9% over 2018, resulting from
7.6% organic Passengers Boarded growth and our 2017/18 migrations, including Southwest Airlines, Japan
Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Kuwait Airways, Boliviana de Aviacion, SmartWings,, Norwegian Air Argentina, Air
Algerie, MIAT Mongolian Airlines ,S7 Airlines, Peruvian Airlines, Maldivian Airlines, Cyprus Airways and
Aeromar on Altéa, as well as, GoAir, Viva Air Peru, Andes Lineas Aéreas, JetSMART flyadeal and Volaris Costa
Rica on New Skies.

Our Airline IT customer base expanded during the quarter. Cyprus Airways and Peruvian Airlines contracted
and implemented the full Altéa Suite, including Inventory, Reservation, Departure Control and Flight
Management. Peruvian Airlines also contracted e-commerce solutions. Additionally, S7 Airlines completed
the implementation of the full Altéa Suite, while Volaris Costa Rica contracted and migrated to New Skies. In
December, we were pleased to announced that Singapore Airlines had implemented Amadeus Altéa NDC
and Amadeus Anytime Merchandising to accelerate its digital transformation and enhance its retailing
capabilities.

During the fourth quarter, we continued to progress in the roll-out of the Guest Reservation System with
InterContinental Hotels Group, which has now been completed successfully. InterContinental Hotels Group’s
more than 5,600 properties across 15 brands and more than 100 countries are now live. Going forward, there
will be future updates to the platform bringing enhanced features and functionality, including attribute-based
selling.

We have remained highly focused on our technology investment as we believe it is the key to our success. In
2018, our investment in R&D amounted to 17.8% of revenue. It was dedicated to support our mid to long-
term growth, through product evolution, portfolio expansion, new customer implementations, system
performance optimization and our continued shift to next-generation technologies and cloud architecture.

In 2018, our Free Cash Flow grew 7.8%’ to €989.0 million. At the end of the year, our net financial debt®
stood at €3,074.0 million, representing 1.47 times last-twelve-month EBITDA’.

2 Operating Review
2.1 Recent business highlights
DISTRIBUTION

During 2018, we signed 50 new contracts or renewals of content or distribution agreements with airlines,
including Vistara, United Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and Norwegian. Subscribers to Amadeus’
inventory can access c. 115 low cost carriers (LCCs) and hybrid carriers’ content worldwide. LCC and
hybrid carriers’ bookings grew 13% in 2018.

Several airlines and travel sellers joined our NDC-X program during 2018, including American Airlines,
Travix, Carlson Wagonlit Travel or American Express Global Business Travel. The NDC-X program, which
we unveiled in February, brings together all of Amadeus’ NDC activities — as an IT provider and an
aggregator — under one roof, so that all relevant travel content from any source (EDIFACT, NDC,
proprietary APIs and other aggregated content) can be distributed via any user interface or device.

In March, we signed an agreement with Air France KLM enabling distribution through a Private Channel.
Amadeus travel seller customers which enact a Private Channel agreement with Air France-KLM will be
able to book Air France KLM content through Amadeus without a surcharge, which started to be levied
from April 2018.

Our merchandising solutions continued to gather interest from our customers. A total of 18 airlines signed
up for Amadeus Airline Ancillary Services for the indirect channel and 16 airlines signed for Amadeus Fare
Families in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, 151 airlines had Amadeus Airline Ancillary Services (from
which 128 had already implemented it) and 81 had Amadeus Fare Families (of which 69 had already
implemented the solution).

IT SOLUTIONS
Corporations

In November, we announced that Bosch will implement Amadeus cytric Travel, the Amadeus corporate
self-booking tool. Bosch will also implement Amadeus’ Mobile platform. Thanks to these solutions, Bosch
will be able to offer its corporate travelers a seamless process from planning and booking their trip to
submitting travel expenses. Bosch employees will additionally benefit from on-trip support, such as
assistance with directions, securing reliable ground transportation or making restaurant reservations.

Airline IT
At the close of December, 214 customers had contracted either of the Amadeus Passenger Service
Systems (Altéa or New Skies) and 204 had implemented them.
During the year, several airlines including S7 Airlines, Bangkok Airways, Philippine Airlines (PAL),
Peruvian Airlines and Cyprus Airways signed up for the full Altéa suite, including the reservation,
inventory, ticketing and departure control modules. The Altéa suite will help these airlines to
enhance customer experience by delivering more consistent and personalized customer service,
develop new revenue streams, and improve operational efficiency. KC International Airlines, a new
Cambodian carrier and Volaris Costa Rica contracted and implemented New Skies. Hawaiian
Airlines, the Honolulu-based airline, selected Amadeus Altéa Departure Control Flight
Management.
In August, Easyjet contracted Amadeus SkySYM by Optym to improve the reliability of its flight
schedules. SkySYM simulates airline schedules in the planning stage to improve schedule reliability
and ensure smooth operations on the actual day of the flight.

In October, Southwest Airlines signed up for the full Amadeus Sky Suite by Optym with a 10-year
agreement. The suite of five industry-first solutions gives Southwest Airlines the most
comprehensive and advanced technology for all its network planning, simulation, forecasting an
optimization needs.

During the year we announced that Singapore Airlines and Avianca had both implemented
Amadeus Altéa NDC.
In March, Qantas completed its ambitious digital redesign. As part of it, the airline implemente
some e-Commerce solutions, including Amadeus e-Personalize, Amadeus Affinity Shopper an
Amadeus Flex Pricer Premium.
We also collaborated with Lufthansa on its new biometric boarding solution using facial recognition.
This innovative pilot, enabled through a collaboration between Amadeus, U.S. Customs and Border
Protection (CBP), Los Angeles World Airports Authority (LAWA), and Vision Box, is available since
March, for Lufthansa flights at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). The airline intends to expan
the pilot program to additional U.S. gateways and other passenger touchpoints.

Additionally, during 2018, a total of 8 airlines had contracted Amadeus Revenue Management,
including Finnair; 7 airlines had contracted Amadeus Anytime Merchandising including Singapore
Airlines; 5 for Passenger Recovery and 7 for Customer Experience Management, including Garuda
Indonesia. Also, Malaysia Airlines contracted for Amadeus Revenue Accounting.

Hospitality

During the year, we continued to progress in the roll-out of the Guest Reservation System with
InterContinental Hotels Group, which has been completed successfully in the fourth quarter.
InterContinental Hotels Group ‘s more than 5,600 properties across 15 brands and more than 100
countries are now live. Going forward, there will be future updates to the platform bringing
enhanced features and functionality, including attribute-based selling.

In August, we announced an agreement to acquire TravelClick for $1.52 billion. TravelClick provides
innovative cloud-based solutions, including an independent and mid-sized hotel Central
Reservation System (CRS) and Guest Management Solution (GMS), as well as business intelligence
and media solutions. The addition of TravelClick’s solutions to the Amadeus portfolio will create a
hospitality leader providing a broad range of innovative technology to hotels and chains of all sizes
across the globe. In October, following the regulatory approvals, Amadeus announced it had
completed the acquisition. See more detail in section 3.2.

In November, we announced that NH Group had joined TravelClick’s Demand360 program which
gives hoteliers unique access to forward-looking demand data and allows hoteliers to develop
optimal strategies for maximizing revenue. Working with TravelClick’s Demand360 provides hotels
with an understanding of the booking trends in their local market, while giving them the ability to
know what actions to take to drive performance and ensure that they are getting their fair share of
bookings through the right segment and channel.

Airport IT

ASA Cape Verde Airports, a customer of Amadeus’ Airport Common Use Service (ACUS), contracted
ACUS Mobile.

We also saw increasing interest from customers in Amadeus Extended Airline System Environment
(EASE) and we signed contracts with airports such as Killeen-Fort Hood Regional Airport, JFK Airport,
Los Angeles International Airport, Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport BZN and Charleston
County Aviation Authority.

Payments

In April, we launched a new solution to facilitate payments of bookings made through airlines’ call
centers. Rather than having to discuss payment details over the phone, with Amadeus Agent Pay
airline agents send their customers a link, via SMS or email, to a secure webpage, so that the traveler
can then complete the payment from their smartphone, tablet or PC. Meanwhile, the ticket is kept
on hold, and issued automatically once the payment is complete. Finnair is using it not only for its
call center but also for its chat-based customer service agents.

Rail

Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) contracted Amadeus to design and power its new intelligent and
flexible booking solution, which will be used across all of SBB’s sales channels —online, at stations
and third parties-.

In September, we expanded our distribution agreement with SNCF, the French national railway.
Thanks to this agreement, travel agencies beyond Europe will have access to SNCF rail content for
the first time.

Other announcements

In the last quarter of the year, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s confirmed their rating s and outlook.
Moody’s a ‘Baa2’ long-term rating for Amadeus, with a stable outlook, and Standard & Poor’s its
‘BBB’ long-term and ‘A-2’short-term ratings, with a positive outlook.

Over the past few months, we have announced several changes to our Executive Committee:

e Wolfgang Krips, former Senior Vice President of Technology Platform Engineering
(TPE) at Amadeus, has been appointed Senior VP Strategy, an appointment driven by
the increasing technological profile of Amadeus.

e Dietmar Fauser has been appointed Senior Vice President of TPE, taking over from Mr.
Krips. Mr. Fauser, who has been with Amadeus since 1998, was until recently Vice
President of Core Platforms and Middleware (CPM) and played a significant role in
recent years in building the TPE organization.

e Francisco Perez-Lozao, former Senior Vice President of New Businesses, has been
appointed Senior Vice President Hospitality. Mr. Perez-Lozao will focus exclusively and
lead the Hospitality business, recently strengthened by the TravelClick acquisition.

e The other new business units will be led by Stefan Roper, appointed Senior Vice
President of Strategic Growth Businesses. Mr. Roper brings over 20 years’
international experience across the technology industry, both in innovative fast-
growth environments and with major tech players.

2.2 Key ongoing R&D projects

As a leading technology provider to the travel industry, Amadeus undertakes significant R&D activities. In
2018, Amadeus devoted 17.8%? of its Group revenue to R&D, which primarily focused on:

Product evolution and portfolio expansion:

e Ongoing efforts for NDC industrialization. Investments related to the development of our platform
to combine content from different sources (existing technology, NDC and content from

3 Presentation of financial information

The audited consolidated financial statements of Amadeus IT Group, S.A. and subsidiaries are the
source to the financial information included in this document and have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.

Certain amounts and figures included in this report have been subject to rounding adjustments. Any
iscrepancies in any tables between the totals and the sums of the amounts listed are due to rounding.

This document includes unaudited Alternative Performance Measures such as EBITDA, operating
ncome, net financial debt as defined by our credit facility agreements, adjusted profit and their
corresponding ratios. These Alternative Performance Measures have been prepared in accordance with
the Guidelines issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority for regulated information
published on or after July 3, 2016.

— EBITDA corresponds to Operating income less D&A expense. A reconciliation to the financial statements
is included in section 6.1.5.

Page 9


--- Page 8 ---

T Group, S.A. a

Report for th

ns of urs) aMaDEUS

— The reconciliation of Operating income is included in the Group income statement included in section
6.1.

— Adjusted profit corresponds to reported profit for the period, after adjusting for: (i) accounting effects
derived from PPA exercises and impairment losses, (ii) non-operating exchange gains (losses), and (iii)
other non-recurring items, as detailed in section 6.1.8.

— Net financial debt as defined by our credit facility agreements is calculated as current and non-current
debt (as per the financial statements), less cash and cash equivalents, adjusted for non-debt items (such
as deferred financing fees, accrued interest and fair value adjustments to an EIB loan). A reconciliation to
the financial statements is included in section 6.2.5.

Also, as explained in more detail in section 3.2, for purposes of comparability with 2017, we present
unaudited financial results, segment results and other alternative performance measures, adjusted to
exclude the consolidated results of TravelClick and TravelClick’s acquisition related effects.

We believe that these measures provide useful and relevant information to facilitate a better
understanding of the performance of Amadeus and its economic position. These measures are not
standard and therefore may not be comparable to those presented by other companies.

When we refer to our competitive position, we take into account our travel agency air bookings in
relation to the travel agency air booking industry, defined as the total volume of travel agency air
bookings processed by the three major global reservation systems (Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport). It
excludes air bookings made directly through airlines’ direct distribution channels (airline offices and
websites), single country operators (primarily in China, Japan, Russia and Turkey), other content
aggregators and direct connect applications between airline systems, travel agencies, corporations and
meta-bookers, which together combined represent an important part of the industry.

3.1 Accounting changes

The following accounting changes have been adopted from January 1, 2018:
IFRS 15

The standard establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when
revenue is recognized.

As a consequence of the adoption of this standard, certain Distribution revenues from the provision of
IT to travel agencies are recognized as a reduction of operating costs (they were previously recognized
within Revenue), with no impact on segment contribution, Group EBITDA or free cash flow.

Other than these effects, there are no significant impacts from the adoption of this standard, given that
more than 90% of the revenues of Distribution and IT Solutions are derived from contracts identified
as “Software as a Service”, compliant with the new IFRS 15 requirements.

The standard has been applied from January 1, 2018 retrospectively and hence 2017 figures shown in
this report have been restated accordingly. Consequently, as shown in the next tables, both Distribution
revenue and operating costs (Cost of revenue, Personnel expenses and Other operating expenses) have
been reduced by €215.5 million in 2017. EBITDA, Operating income, Profit and Free cash flow in 2017
are not impacted by the adoption of this standard.

Page 10


--- Page 9 ---

T Group, S.A. a
Report for th

ns of urs) aMaDEUS

IFRS 9

Among other changes, the standard establishes a new impairment model for the recognition of bad
debt provisions based on expected credit losses rather than incurred credit losses.

As a consequence of the adoption of this standard, bad debt provisions, recognized within operating
costs, have increased, negatively impacting segment contribution and EBITDA (by the same amount) as
well as Profit (by the same amount less the associated tax benefit).

Also, the standard modifies the hedging accounting, resulting in a reduction in net financial expense
and an increase in Profit (by the same amount less the associated tax impact).

There are no significant impacts from the adoption of this standard, other than the effects mentioned
above.

Free cash flow is not impacted by the adoption of this standard.

For comparison purposes, 2017 figures shown in this report have been restated for the adoption of this
standard. Consequently, as shown in the next tables, in 2017, Other operating expenses has increased
by €5.2 million and net financial expense has declined by €4.8 million, resulting in a reduction in both
EBITDA and Operating income of €5.2 million and a decline in Profit of €0.2 million.

Allocation of building and facilities expense

Since January 1, 2018, building and facilities expense is recognized within Indirect costs in full
(previously these costs were partly allocated to Distribution and IT Solutions). Given the geographic
expansion of our businesses and our customer focus, buildings and facilities are often shared by teams
from all of our businesses, making segment allocation rules increasingly complex. We believe this
reallocation results in a cost structure of the operating segments that provides a more accurate
reflection of our segment profitability levels.

As a result of this cost reallocation, the Distribution and IT Solutions contributions have increased, as
well as Indirect costs, with no impact on Group EBITDA, profit or free cash flow.

For comparison purposes, 2017 figures shown in this report have been restated for the adoption of this
cost reallocation. Consequently, as shown in the next tables, in 2017 both the Distribution contribution
and the IT Solutions contribution have increased by €49.2 million and €42.7 million, respectively, and
Net indirect costs has increased by €91.9 million. 2017 EBITDA, Operating income, Profit and Free cash
flow are not impacted by the adoption of this cost reallocation.

IFRS 16

We are early adopters of the standard applying it from January 1, 2018°°. The standard introduces a
single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for right-of-use assets. The main impact from its
adoption is that we have recognized new assets and liabilities for our operating leases of building
rentals. Also, the nature of expenses related to those leases have changed as the standard replaces the
straight-line operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest
expense on lease liabilities. This change has resulted in a reduction in operating costs (and therefore an
increase in EBITDA), and higher depreciation and amortization expenses, with limited (positive) impact
on Operating income. Also, interest expense increases. As a result, Profit is only impacted marginally.
Cash generation is not impacted by the adoption of this standard, however Free cash flow is positively
impacted by it, given that a large part of the payments done in relation to operating leases is now
reported as financial flows (debt payments) whereas it was previously reported as operating flows
(within EBITDA).

The impact from the adoption of this standard in 2018 has been:

A reduction in operating costs of €47.4 million (driving an increase in EBITDA by the same amount), higher
D&A expense by €45.4 million (together resulting in an increase in Operating income of €2.0 million) and
higher interest expense by €4.9 million. As a result, Profit decreased by €2.1 million in 2018.

An increase in right-of-use assets (non-current assets) and financial debt (split between current and non-
current liabilities in the balance sheet) of €251.1 million and €259.7 million, respectively, as of December
31, 2018. Financial debt related to operating leases arising from the adoption of this standard does not
form part of the financial debt as per our credit facility agreements’ definition.

A positive impact of €47.4 million in Free cash flow, as a result of the increase in EBITDA (€47.4 million),
as explained above. There is, however, no impact on cash generation as the increase in Free cash flow is
offset by higher debt repayments (by the same amount) below the Free cash flow line.

2° Given the method chosen for the application of the standard (modified retrospective approach), 2017 figures are not restated for IFRS 16.

3.2 TravelClick acquisition

On August 10, 2018, Amadeus announced its agreement to acquire Project Dwight Ultimate Parent
Corporation and its group of companies (“TravelClick”), a U.S-based leading global provider of
technology and business solutions to the hospitality industry. Amadeus received all the necessary
regulatory approvals and the closing took place on October 4, 2018. The acquisition price amounted to
USD 1,520 million. The acquisition was 100% debt-financed. On September 18, 2018 Amadeus
undertook three Eurobond issues for a total amount of €1,500 million, which were partly used to
finance TravelClick’s acquisition (see section 6.2.5 for more detail).

The results of TravelClick (“TC”) were consolidated into Amadeus’ books from October 4, 2018,
contributing €86.7 million in revenues, €22.3 million in EBITDA, €14.1 million in profit and €14.8 million
in free cash flow, to our full year and fourth quarter 2018 results (excluding non-recurring costs
associated with the acquisition). TravelClick is reported, as part of our Hospitality IT business, within
our IT Solutions segment (except for TravelClick’s indirect costs, which have been allocated to Indirect
costs).

As a consequence of TravelClick’s acquisition, the following non-recurring effects have been accounted
for in 2018:

TravelClick’s acquisition and integration related costs, incurred in full in the fourth quarter of
2018, amounting to €19.5 million (before taxes). Of these, an amount of €4.8 million was paid
in the quarter. These costs mainly refer to third party expert advisory fees (including bankers,
lawyers, accountants and consultants, among others) and costs related to its integration.

A purchase price allocation exercise in relation to the consolidation of TravelClick into Amadeus’
books was carried out in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a consequence of such PPA exercise, the
following effects (before taxes) have arisen:

e  Areduction in revenue and in personnel and other operating expenses amounting to €8.2
million and €0.6 million, respectively, derived from the adjustment to fair value of certain
operating liabilities, resulting in a negative impact of €7.7 million to EBITDA.

e An additional amortization expense of €12.2 million, increasing the total group
amortization expense.

TravelClick’s acquisition financing related fees amounting to €8.2 million were paid in 2018 (€2.0
million in the fourth quarter). These financing fees are deferred in the balance sheet and
recognized in the income statement over the life of the related debt. In 2018, €0.4 million
(before taxes) were recognized in the income statement (under the interest expense caption).

TravelClick’s acquisition related effects described above (acquisition-related costs, PPA effects and
acquisition financing fees) have impacted our group results and cash generation, in particular our
revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Operating income, Profit, Adjusted profit, EPS, adjusted EPS and free
cash flow in 2018.

For clarity purposes, in the following tables we display Amadeus Group figures (including TravelClick’s
consolidated results) and Amadeus Group figures excluding TravelClick’s acquisition, in two separate
columns. The aggregated impacts from the PPA exercise and the non-recurring costs associated with
TravelClick’s acquisition, as well as the impacts from TravelClick’s acquisition financing are also
disclosed in a separate column.

4 Main financial risks and hedging policy
4.1 Foreign exchange rate risk

Our reporting currency is the Euro. However, as a result of Amadeus’ global activity and presence, part of our
results are generated in currencies different from the Euro and therefore are impacted by foreign exchange
fluctuations. Similarly, part of our cash inflows and outflows are denominated in non-Euro currencies. As a
consequence, both our results and our cash flows are impacted, either positively or negatively, by foreign
exchange fluctuations.

Exposure to foreign currencies

Our revenue is almost entirely generated either in Euro or in US Dollar (the latter representing 30%-40% of
our total revenue). Revenue generated in currencies other than the Euro or US Dollar is negligible.

In turn, 50%-60% of our operating costs’? are denominated in many currencies different from the Euro,
including the US Dollar which represents 30%-40% of our operating costs. The rest of the foreign currency
operating expenses are denominated in a variety of currencies, GBP, AUD, INR, SGD and THB being the most
significant. A number of these currencies may fluctuate vs. the Euro similarly to the US Dollar - Euro
fluctuations, and the degree of this correlation may vary with time.

Hedging policy

Amadeus’ target is to reduce the volatility generated by foreign exchange fluctuations on its non-Euro
denominated net cash flows. Our hedging strategy is as follows:

To manage our exposure to the US Dollar, we have a natural hedge to our net operating cash flow
generated in US Dollar or US Dollar-correlated currencies through, among others, payments of USD-
denominated debt (when applicable) and taxes paid in the US. We enter into derivative arrangements
when this natural hedge is not sufficient to cover our outstanding exposure.

We also hedge a number of currencies, including the GBP, AUD, INR and SEK, for which we enter into
foreign exchange derivatives with banks.

When the hedges in place covering operating flows qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS, profits and losses
are recognized within the revenue caption. Our hedging arrangements typically qualify for hedge accounting
under IFRS.

Given that 25-35% of our net free cash flow is generated in USD or currencies that fluctuate vs. the Euro
similarly to the US Dollar-Euro fluctuations, and that our hedging policy targets to reduce cash volatility, our
hedging results are generally insufficient to mitigate the impacts from foreign exchange fluctuations on our
Operating results.

In 2018, foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue and EBITDA, a positive impact on
costs and an expansive impact on EBITDA margin. Excluding foreign exchange effects and the impact from
the adoption of IFRS 16, both revenue and EBITDA (excluding TravelClick’s acquisition-related costs and PPA
impact) grew at a high single-digit rate, respectively, and EBITDA margin was broadly stable.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, foreign exchange fluctuations had a small positive impact on both
revenue and EBITDA and a small negative impact on costs, resulting in a small negative impact on
EBITDA margin. Excluding foreign exchange effects and the impact from the adoption of IFRS 16,

3 Including Cost of revenue, Personnel expenses and Other operating expenses. Excludes Depreciation and amortization.

--- Page 18 ---

T Group, S.A. and Subsidiaries

revenue and EBITDA (excluding TravelClick’s acquisition-related costs and PPA impact) grew at double-
digit and low double-digit rates, respectively, in the fourth quarter of the year.

4.2 Interest rate risk

Our target is to reduce volatility in net interest flows. In order to achieve this objective, Amadeus may enter
into interest rate hedging agreements (interest rate swaps, caps, collars) to cover the floating rate debt.

At December 31, 2018, 23% of our total financial debt (related to the European Commercial Paper
Program and one Eurobond issue) was subject to floating interest rates, indexed to the EURIBOR. As of
this date no interest rate hedges were in place.

4.3. Ownshares price evolution risk
Amadeus has three different staff remuneration schemes which are settled with Amadeus’ shares.

According to the rules of these plans, when they mature all beneficiaries will receive a number of
Amadeus shares which for the outstanding plans amount to (depending on the evolution of certain
performance conditions), between a minimum of 296,000 shares and a maximum of 1,565,000 shares,
approximately. It is Amadeus’ practice and intention to make use of its treasury shares to settle these
plans at their maturity.

In 2018, industry air bookings grew by 2.9% globally. With the exception of Western Europe - where
the industry declined, impacted by the effects mentioned above - all regions showed a positive
evolution, although with a clear decelerating trend relative to 2017 (except for North America, which
has accelerated its growth compared to last year’s). Asia and Pacific reported the fastest growth rate in
2018, followed by North America. Central, Eastern and Southern Europe, Middle East and Africa and
Latin America showed limited growth over the period.

Amadeus bookings

In the fourth quarter of 2018, Amadeus travel agency air bookings grew by 1.0%, leading to a 2.1% increase
over the year. North America was our fastest growing region in the fourth quarter, supported by an
improvement in our competition position”, in the context of a robust industry. Both Middle East and Africa
and Latin America delivered healthy growth. Amadeus’ bookings in Asia and Pacific showed limited growth,
on the back of an overall industry deceleration in the region. Amadeus’ bookings in Europe showed a
contraction over the fourth quarter of 2018, impacted by the industry's continued booking decline. Also,
Amadeus’ Western European bookings were impacted by the loss of share at some European mid-size online
travel agencies resulting from heightened commercial activity in the market. Excluding Western Europe,

In 2018, Amadeus’ bookings increased by 2.1%. Asia and Pacific and North America were our best performing
regions, delivering high growth rates. Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Central, Eastern and Southern
Europe increased softly, supported by limited growth in the industry. Finally, Amadeus’ bookings in Western
Europe declined over the period, impacted by the industry decline and the loss of share at some European
mid-size online travel agencies, as explained above. Excluding Western Europe, Amadeus bookings grew 7.2%

Revenue 724.9 704.2 2.9% 3,004.3 2,922.1 2.8%

1 Our disclosure no longer displays the annual break-out between booking and non-booking revenue, as application of IFRS
15 since January 1, 2018 has considerably reduced the size of the non booking revenue caption and most of the remaining
concepts are today of similar nature to booking activity.

Distribution delivered revenue growth of 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2018, driving 2.8% full year
growth vs. 2017. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by volume expansion and an enhancement
in the average revenue per booking. Revenue growth was also supported by a small positive foreign
exchange effect.

In 2018, revenue growth resulted from an increase in bookings of 1.7% and an expansive revenue per
booking, negatively impacted by foreign exchange effects. Excluding foreign exchange effects,
Distribution revenue grew at a mid single-digit rate, driven by booking growth and an underlying
average revenue per booking expansion, in turn supported by (i) a positive booking mix, both from an
increased weight of global bookings and a declining weight of non-air bookings, with a lower average
fee, and (ii) customer renegotiations.

5.1.3 Contribution

Contribution increased by 2.3%, amounting to €1,380.7 million in 2018. This positive performance was
the combination of 2.8% revenue growth, as explained in section 5.1.2 above, partly offset by 3.3%
increase in our net operating costs. Contribution was negatively impacted by foreign exchange effects.
Contribution represented 46.0% of revenue in the year, slightly below 2017. Contribution margin was
positively impacted by foreign exchange effects. Excluding foreign exchange effects, contribution
margin declined vs. 2017, in line with our expectations and in the same range as we have experienced
over the past few years.

Growth in net operating costs in the year resulted from:

Higher variable costs, due to (i) a 2.1% increase in travel agency air bookings, (ii) a unitary distribution cost
expansion, mainly driven by heightened competitive pressure, a negative customer mix impact on
incentives paid to travel agencies and a negative country mix (driven by the higher weight over our total
volumes of some of the countries where Amadeus operates through local distributors, such as India,
South Korea and some Middle Eastern countries), and (iii) non-recurring effects related to local taxes.

A decline in net fixed costs, resulting from (i) contained FTE and unit personnel cost evolution, together
with higher resources devoted to the R&D activity, offset by (ii) an increase in the capitalization ratio,
impacted by project mix, and a reduction in several cost lines, which by nature may show a more volatile
behavior per quarter.

Positive foreign exchange effects.

5.2.1 Evolution of Amadeus passengers boarded

Amadeus passengers boarded grew by 6.6% to 456.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, leading to a full
year 2018 growth of 11.9%.

This double-digit growth in the year was driven by (i) the impact from the 2017 implementations (such as
Southwest Airlines, Japan Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Kuwait Airways, Boliviana de Aviacién, SmartWings,
Norwegian Air Argentina, Air Algerie and MIAT Mongolian Airlines on Altéa, and GoAir, Viva Air Peru, Andes
Lineas Aéreas, JetSMART and flyadeal on New Skies) and the 2018 implementations (including S7 Airlines,
Peruvian Airlines, Maldivian Airlines, Cyprus Airways and Aeromar on Altéa and Volaris Costa Rica on New
Skies), and (ii) a 7.6% organic growth. Passengers boarded growth was negatively impacted by the ceasing of
operations of Air Berlin and Monarch Airlines during the second half of 2017, and by the de-migration of
LATAM Airlines Brazil from our platform during the second quarter of 2018.

Of our 1,853.9 million passengers boarded during 2018, 60.3% were generated outside of Europe. Our
international footprint has continued to expand, particularly in Asia and Pacific and in North America,
supported by the implementations of Southwest Airlines, Japan Airlines and Malaysia Airlines, among others,
in 2017. As mentioned above, passengers boarded growth in Western Europe and Latin America during 2018
was negatively impacted by the ceasing of operations of Air Berlin and Monarch Airlines as well as the de-
migration of LATAM Airlines Brazil from our platform during the second quarter of 2018, respectively.

IT transactional revenue

In this category we include revenues from (i) our PSS offering for airlines, (ii) our e-commerce solutions,
which provide online shopping and booking engines for airline websites, along with related
functionalities, (iii) our range of standalone IT solutions (in the areas of merchandising, personalization,
revenue optimization and disruption management, among others), which are complementary to, and

fully compatible with, our Altéa solutions, and (iv) revenue from our Airport IT and Payments (the
Merchant Hub offering) businesses.

IT transactional revenue increased by 7.7% in 2018, driven by:

Volume expansion, resulting from organic growth and customer implementations, as explained in
section 5.2.1.

A dilutive IT transactional revenue per PB, impacted negatively by foreign exchange effects and an
increasing weight of low-cost and hybrid carriers. Excluding these effects, IT transactional revenue per PB
expanded in the year, supported by upselling activity (particularly, solutions such as revenue
management, merchandizing and personalization and revenue accounting had a strong performance in
the period) and the positive contribution from airport IT and payments.

Direct distribution revenue

Direct distribution revenue includes (i) fees charged for bookings made through the direct sales channel
of an airline using our Altéa Reservation solution and for certain types of air bookings made through
the direct sales channel of Altéa customers for which we charge a booking fee, not a PB fee, and (ii)
fees charged to airlines using our Altéa Reservation solution for complementary functionalities that are
closely related to the booking process.

Revenue from direct distribution increased by 16.4%, driven by volume growth and negative non-
recurring items impacting 2017.

Non-transactional revenue

Non-transactional revenue comprises among others, (i) the recognition of deferred customization an:
implementation fees of our solutions, (ii) the provision of bespoke and consulting services, and (iii)
revenues related to our Hospitality IT solutions.

Non-transactional revenue increased by 6.4% in 2018, negatively impacted by foreign exchange effects.
Excluding foreign exchange effects, this caption grew at a double-digit rate, supported by the goo
performance of hospitality IT (excluding TravelClick).

5.2.3 Contribution

Contribution expanded by 8.3%, to €1,321.5 million. This positive performance was the combination o
8.0% revenue growth, as explained in section 5.2.2 above, and 7.3% increase in our net operating costs.

Contribution was impacted by negative foreign exchange effects, excluding which contribution grew at
a low double-digit growth rate. Contribution margin expanded by 0.2 p.p. to 71.3%, impacted positively
by foreign exchange effects. Excluding foreign exchange effects, contribution margin was broadly stable
vs. 2017.

Net operating costs increase in the year resulted from:

The reinforcement of (i) our commercial teams, to better support our product offering, customer base
and geographic business expansion, and (ii) increased R&D expenditure dedicated to our airline IT
portfolio enhancement and to the product portfolio expansion and customer implementation activity in
our new businesses.

A higher capitalization ratio, impacted by project mix.

5.3. EBITDA

In 2018, EBITDA increased by 8.5% to €2,018.3 million, negatively impacted by foreign exchange effects
(see section 4.1 for details on the exposure of our operating results to foreign exchange fluctuations).

EBITDA growth resulted from the positive performances of Distribution and IT Solutions and a reduction
in net indirect costs as a consequence of the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2018 (based on which operating
lease costs are no longer recognized within indirect costs. See section 3.1 for details on accounting
changes). Excluding foreign exchange effects and the IFRS 16 impact, EBITDA grew at a mid to high
single-digit rate in the year.

In 2018, EBITDA margin represented 41.6% of revenue, expanding 1.4 p.p. vs. prior year. EBITDA margin
was positively impacted by foreign exchange effects, as well as by the IFRS 16 adoption in 2018.
Excluding both, EBITDA margin was broadly stable vs. 2017.

Net indirect costs declined by 3.7% in 2018 vs. 2017. Excluding the IFRS 16 impact, net indirect costs
increased by 2.9%, resulting from: (i) expansion in R&D investment devoted to cross-area technology,
including the shift to next-generation technologies and cloud services, as well as projects related to our
overall infrastructure (see section 2.2 for further details), and (ii) increased resources in our corporate
functions to support our business expansion, including technological projects to improve the efficiency
and flexibility of internal processes partially offset by (iii) a higher capitalization ratio, impacted by
project mix, and (iv) positive foreign exchange effects.

6.1.1 Revenue

In the fourth quarter of 2018, revenue amounted to €1,173.4 million, growing 5.3% vs. the same period
in 2017. This resulted in full year revenue of €4,857.2, a growth of 4.7% vs. prior year.

Growth in the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 was driven by the positive evolution of Distribution
and IT Solutions. Our revenue was negatively impacted by foreign exchange effects in 2018, despite a

small positive effect during the fourth quarter. Excluding foreign exchange effects, revenue grew at a
mid-single-digit rate and a mid-to-high single-digit rate, in the fourth quarter and the full year,
respectively.

Overall, revenue growth was a combination of:

An increase of 2.9% in Distribution in the fourth quarter of 2018, or 2.8% growth for the year.
An increase of 9.3% in IT Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2018, driving an 8.0% in the year.

See sections 5.1.2. and 5.2.2. for more detail on revenue growth in Distribution and IT Solutions.

Revenue 1,173.4 1,114.7 5.3% 4,857.2 4,637.2 4.7%

6.1.2 Cost of revenue

These costs are mainly related to: (i) incentive fees paid to travel agencies, (ii) distribution fees paid to
local commercial organizations which act as a local distributor (mainly in the Middle East, North Africa,
India, and South Korea), as well as non-reimbursable local taxes, and (iii) data communication expenses
related to the maintenance of our computer network, including connection charges.

Cost of revenue grew by 7.6% to €1,173.3 million in 2018 vs. prior year. The increase in cost of revenue
was driven by (i) booking volume expansion, (ii) a higher unitary distribution cost, resulting from
heightened competitive pressure and a negative country mix (driven by the higher weight over our total
volumes of some of the countries where Amadeus operates through local distributors, such as India,
South Korea and some Middle Eastern countries), and (iii) non-recurring effects related to local taxes.

.3. Personnel and related expenses and other operating expenses

A large number of Amadeus’ employees are software engineers. Amadeus also hires contractors to
support its development activity, complementing permanent staff. The overall ratio of permanent staff
vs. contractors devoted to R&D may fluctuate depending on business needs and project mix, therefore
impacting the evolution of both “Personnel expenses” and “Other operating expenses” captions in our

income statement.

Our combined Personnel and other operating cost line increased by 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018
vs. prior year, positively impacted by the IFRS 16 adoption from January 1, 2018 (see section 3.1 for
further details).

In the full year period, this cost line declined by 1.3%, impacted positively by the IFRS 16 effect, as
explained above, and foreign exchange effects. Excluding foreign exchange effects and the impact from
the adoption of IFRS 16, Personnel and Other operating expenses together increased moderately in the
year vs. previous year, resulting from:

A7% increase in average FTEs (permanent staff and contractors), mainly due to higher resources devoted
to R&D (see further details in sections 2.2 and 6.2.2) and, to a lesser extent, an increase in headcount in

our corporate function, driven by our geographical and business expansion. The expansion of our
commercial and customer support units also contributed to the FTE growth.

country mix.

Growth in non-personnel related expenses, such as computing and consultancy costs.
These effects were partially offset by (i) an increase in capitalizations, driven by both R&D investment

Limited growth in unit personnel cost, as a result of our global salary increase, partly offset by a positive

growth and a higher capitalization ratio, impacted by project mix, and (ii) a reduction in several cost lines,

Depreciation and amortization (including capitalized D&A) was 7.9% higher in the fourth quarter of

Ordinary D&A grew by 19.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018 vs. prior year, and 20.0% in 2018, partly
driven by the adoption of IFRS 16 from January 1, 2018 (see further details in section 3.1). Excluding

the impact from the IFRS 16 adoption (€13.4 million in the fourth quarter and €44.4 million in the full

year period), ordinary D&A grew by 8.4% and 9.6% in the fourth quarter and in the full year period,
respectively. Ordinary D&A growth in 2018 was driven by higher amortization of intangible assets, as
capitalized development expenses on our balance sheet started being amortized in parallel with the
associated project or contract revenue recognition, coupled with a modest increase in depreciation
expense.

6.1.5 EBITDA and Operating income

In 2018, EBITDA increased by 8.5% to €2,018.3 million, negatively impacted by foreign exchange effects
(see section 4.1 for details on the exposure of our operating results to foreign exchange fluctuations).

Page 30

T Group, S.A. and Subsidiaries

” Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (millions of euros) a M a D E | ] S

EBITDA growth resulted from (i) the positive performances of Distribution and IT Solutions and (ii) a
reduction in net indirect costs driven by our adoption of IFRS 16 in 2018 (based on which operating
lease costs are no longer recognized within indirect costs. See section 3.1 for details on accounting
changes). Excluding foreign exchange effects and the IFRS 16 impact, EBITDA grew at a mid-to-high
single-digit rate in the year.

In 2018, EBITDA represented 41.6% of revenue, expanding 1.4 p.p. vs. prior year. EBITDA margin was
positively impacted by foreign exchange effects, as well as by the IFRS 16 adoption in 2018. Excluding
both, EBITDA margin was broadly stable vs. 2017.

Operating income grew by 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2018, or by 7.2% to €1,412.5 million in 2018,
as a result of an increase in EBITDA and higher D&A charges.

Net financial expense increased by €9.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, and declined by €5.7 million, or
10.3%, in 2018. Excluding the impact from the adoption of IFRS 16 (€4.8 million in 2018. See section 3.1 for
further details), net financial expense declined by €10.5 million or 19.0% in 2018, mainly due to a reduction
of €4.9 million in exchange losses vs. 2017. Interest expense declined vs. previous year by 12.2% (if we exclude
the IFRS 16 impact), as a result of both lower average cost of debt and lower average gross debt (this is
excluding TravelClick’s acquisition financing impacts).

6.1.7 Income taxes

Income taxes amounted to €342.6 million in 2018, a growth of 30.9% vs. 2017. The income tax rate in
2018 was 25.2%, higher than the 20.7% rate in 2017. The income tax rate in 2017 was impacted by a
number of non-recurring effects, including adjustments to deferred tax liabilities in France and the U.S.
due to lower corporate tax rates starting in 2018, in accordance with government regulatory changes,
and tax deductions related to non-recurring transactions. Excluding the impacts from the non-recurring
adjustments to deferred tax liabilities in 2017, income taxes grew by €27.5 million or 8.7% in 2018 vs.
2017.

6.1.8 Profit for the period. Adjusted profit

In the fourth quarter of 2018, reported profit declined by 18.4% to €186.4 million, driving full year 2018
growth to 1.6%. 2017 reported profit was positively impacted by non-recurring effects affecting income
tax, as explained in section 6.1.7. Excluding the impacts from non-recurring adjustments to deferred
tax liabilities in 2017, reported profit grew by 6.4% and 7.3% in the fourth quarter and full year 2018,
respectively, vs. the same period of 2017.

After adjusting for (i) accounting effects derived from PPA exercises and impairment losses, (ii) non-
operating exchange gains (losses), and (iii) other non-recurring items, adjusted profit declined by 17.4%
in the fourth quarter of 2018, or by 0.3% to €1,108.5 million in 2018. Excluding the impacts from non-
recurring adjustments to deferred tax liabilities in 2017, adjusted profit grew by 3.1% and 4.7% in the
fourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively, vs. the same period of 2017.

On December 14, 2017, the Board of Directors of Amadeus agreed to undertake a share repurchase program,
in accordance with the authorization granted to it by the General Shareholders’ Meeting held on June 20,
2013. The purpose of the share repurchase program was the redemption of shares (subject to our General
Shareholders’ Meeting approval). The maximum investment approved under the program was €1,000
million, not exceeding 25,000,000 shares (or 5.69% of share capital), to be carried out in two tranches:

Tranche 1: up to €500 million (non-cancellable), from January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019.
Tranche 2: up to €500 million (cancellable at Company's discretion), from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020.

Following TravelClick’s acquisition, on October 25, 2018, Amadeus announced that the Board of Directors
agreed to cancel the second (cancellable) tranche of the share repurchase program, which was due to start
on April 1, 2019.

On December 10, 2018, Amadeus announced it had reached the maximum investment under the first
tranche (€500 million), thus completing the share repurchase program. Under the program, Amadeus
acquired 7,554,070 shares (representing 1.721% of Amadeus share capital).

Under our credit facility agreements’ terms, financial debt (i) does not include the accrued interest
payable (€5.5 million at December 31, 2018) which is treated as financial debt in our financial
statements, (ii) is calculated based on its nominal value, while in our financial statements our financial
debt is measured at amortized cost, i.e., after deducting the deferred financing fees (that mainly
correspond to fees paid upfront in connection with the set-up of new credit agreements and amount
to €14.9 million at December 31, 2018), (iii) does not include an adjustment for the difference between
the nominal value of the loan granted by the EIB at below-market interest rate and its fair value (€1.9
million at December 31, 2018), and (iv) does not include debt related to assets under operating lease
agreements (which form part of the financial debt in the statement of financial position) amounting to

Non-recurring costs amounting to €12.9 million, paid in 2018.
Interest paid related to TravelClick’s acquisition financing amounting to €0.2 million.

Excluding the above non-recurring costs and interest paid in relation to TravelClick’s acquisition, free cash
flow amounted to €989.0 million in 2018, a 7.8% increase vs. 2017. See section 3.2 for a reconciliation of
the above effects.

6.3.1 Change in working capital

Working capital inflow decreased by €59.8 million in 2018, mostly driven by (i) accounting effects from
non-cash operating items, such as bad debt provisions and the recognition of previously deferred
revenue, and (ii) timing differences in some payments and collections, partly related to changes in the
contract terms with a supplier.

6.3.2 Capital expenditure, R&D investment
Capital expenditure

The table below details the capital expenditure in the period, both in relation to property, plant and
equipment (“PP&E”) and to intangible assets. Based on the nature of our investments in PP&E, the
figures may show variations on a quarterly basis, depending on the timing of certain investments. The
same applies to our investments in contractual relationships where payments to travel agencies may
take place in different periods, based on the timing of the negotiations. In turn, our capitalized R&D
investment may fluctuate depending on the level of capitalization ratio, which is impacted by the
intensity of the development activity, the mix of projects undertaken and the different stages of the
various projects.

Capex in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased by 22.0% vs. prior year, as a result of:

Higher capex in intangible assets, driven by growth in software capitalizations, due to an increase in both
R&D investment and capitalization ratio, impacted by project mix. Signing bonuses paid in the fourth
quarter of the year decreased vs. previous year.

A decline in capex devoted to property, plant and equipment.

TravelClick’s contribution to capital expenditure.

In 2018, capex amounted to €718.2 million, an increase of 17.3% vs. 2017. As a percentage of revenue,
capex represented 14.6%, 1.3 p.p. higher than the same period of previous year. Capex in intangible
assets in the year expanded 23.0% vs. 2017, largely driven by an increase in software capitalizations
and, to a lesser extent, higher signing bonuses paid and TravelClick’s contribution.

It is important to note that a large part of our investments do not have any revenue associated at this
stage (particularly in the case of new diversification initiatives), or are investments for projects that will
produce revenue during the life of the contracts, on average 10 to 15 years in Airline IT and 3 to 5 in
Distribution, thereby affecting the capex as a percentage of revenue ratio. It is also important to note
that a large part of our investments related to the migration of our clients is paid by the customer,
although not recognized as revenue but deferred in the balance sheet. It is therefore capex which does
not have a negative cash impact and where revenue does not get recognized as such, making the ratio
of capex to revenue less relevant.

17.8%, 1.7 p.p. higher than prior year.

Growth in R&D investment in 2018 resulted from:

Increased resources to enhance and expand our product portfolio (including projects under the scope of
our NDC-X program, merchandizing, shopping and personalization solutions, our revenue optimization
portfolio, disruption management tools, etc.) and to implement solutions associated with our Airline IT
upselling activity.

Investment devoted to our new businesses, particularly Hospitality, Airport IT and Payments.

Efforts dedicated to the shift to next-generation technologies and cloud services and continued
enhancement of the overall infrastructure and processes to enhance efficiency, flexibility, availability and
security.

The impact from TravelClick’s consolidation.

It should be noted that a significant part of our research and development costs are linked to activities
which are subject to capitalization. The intensity of the development activity and the different stages
in the ongoing projects have an effect on the capitalization ratio in any given quarter, thereby impacting
the level of operating expenses that are capitalized on our balance sheet.

6.3.3. Taxes paid

In 2018, cash taxes amounted to €287.6 million, a decline of €75.8 million, or 20.9% vs. previous year.
This decrease was mainly due to (i) higher reimbursements from previous years, and (ii) lower prepaid
taxes in the U.S. resulting from a decrease in the corporate tax rate in 2018, in accordance with
government regulatory changes.

6.3.4 Interest and financial fees paid

Interest payments under our debt arrangements amounted to €32.4 million in 2018, €5.3 million higher
than in 2017. This increase was mostly due to non-recurring fees paid (i) in relation to the Eurobonds
issued in September 2018, and (ii) the cancellation of two revolving facilities and the set-up of a new
revolving facility, in April 2018. These effects were partly offset by (i) the final payment of the coupon
of €400 million bonds, which matured on December 2017, and (ii) a non-recurring fee from the
cancellation of an interest rate swap in 2017.

6.3.5 Equity investments

In 2018, equity investments amounted to €1,315.1. This cash outflow mainly relates to TravelClick’s
acquisition, as detailed in section 3.2. In 2017, equity investments (€31.4 million) mostly correspond to
the acquisition of i:FAO shares.

6.3.6 Cash flow from non-operating and extraordinary items

In 2018, cash outflow from non-operating and extraordinary items amounted to €48.7 million, mostly
relating to exchange differences related to non-operating assets and liabilities.

6.3.7. Cash to shareholders

In 2018, the cash outflow to shareholders, amounting to €1,003.2 million, corresponds to (i) a payment
of €494.3 million related to the ordinary dividend of €1.135 per share (gross) on the 2017 profit, (ii) the
acquisition of treasury shares for a total amount of €500.0 million in relation to the first tranche of the
share repurchase program (as described in section 7.3.2) and (iii) the acquisition of treasury shares to
cover the staff shared-based remuneration schemes (as described in section 4.3).

7.3.1 Dividend payments

At the General Shareholders’ Meeting held on June 21, 2018, our shareholders approved the annual gross
dividend from the 2017 profit. The total value of the dividend increased 20.7% vs. prior year to €498.1 million,
representing a pay-out of 50% of the 2017 reported profit for the year, or €1.135 per share (gross). An interim
amount of €0.48 per share (gross) was paid on January 31, 2018 and the complementary dividend of €0.655
per share (gross) was paid on June 29, 2018.

On December 13, 2018 the Board of Directors of Amadeus proposed a 50% pay-out ratio for the 2018
dividend.

In June 2019, the Board of directors will submit to the General Shareholders’ Meeting for approval a
final gross dividend of €1.175 per share, representing a 3.5% increase vs. the 2017 dividend and a 50%
of the reported Profit, adjusted to exclude TravelClick’s acquisition related effects. An interim dividend
of €0.51 per share (gross) was paid in full on January 17, 2019. Based on this, the proposed
appropriation of the 2018 results included in our 2018 audited consolidated financial statements
includes a total amount of €515.6 million corresponding to dividends pertaining to the financial year
2018.

7.3.2 Share repurchase program

Amadeus has stated that in low leverage scenarios, it would complement ordinary shareholder remuneration
with extraordinary remuneration.

On December 14, 2017, the Board of Directors of Amadeus agreed to undertake a share repurchase program,
in accordance with the authorization granted to it by the General Shareholders’ Meeting held on June 20,
2013. The purpose of the share repurchase program was the redemption of shares (subject to our General
Shareholders’ Meeting approval). The maximum investment approved under the program was €1,000
million, not exceeding 25,000,000 shares (or 5.69% of share capital), to be carried out in two tranches:

Tranche 1: up to €500 million (non-cancellable), from January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019.
Tranche 2: up to €500 million (cancellable at Company's discretion), from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020.

Following TravelClick’s acquisition, on October 25, 2018, Amadeus announced that the Board of Directors
agreed to cancel the second (cancellable) tranche of the share repurchase program, which was due to start
on April 1, 2019.

On December 10, 2018, Amadeus announced it had reached the maximum investment under the first
tranche (€500 million), thus completing the share repurchase program. Under the program, Amadeus
has acquired 7,554,070 shares (representing 1.721% of Amadeus share capital).

8 Other additional information
8.1 Expected Business Evolution
8.1.1 Macroeconomic environment

Given that Amadeus operates transaction-based business models, our operating results are highly
linked to travel volumes (mainly bookings made by travel agencies connected to the Amadeus
Distribution system, or passengers boarded by airlines using our IT solutions) at a global scale. Amadeus’
businesses and operations are largely dependent on the worldwide travel and tourism industry, which
is sensitive to general economic conditions and trends.

In January 2018, the IMF updated its World Economic Outlook, reporting that the growth of the global
economy is expected to decelerate in 2019, growing at 3.5%, vs. 3.7% in 2018.

Growth in the advanced economies is projected to slowdown (2.0% in 2019 vs. 2.3% in 2018) mainly
driven by slowdowns expected in the United States (2.5% in 2019, vs. 2.9% in 2019) and the Euro Zone
(1.6% in 2019 vs. 1.8% in 2018).

Growth in the emerging markets and developing economies are also expected to decelerate (4.5% in
2019 vs. 4.6% in 2018) reflecting contractions in Argentina and Turkey, as well as the impact of trade
actions on China and other Asian economies.

IATA believe that the slowdown in economic growth coupled with rising fuel costs will lead to a
deceleration in air traffic growth, which is expected to expand by 6.0%”° in 2019 (vs. 6.5% in 2018). All
regions are expected to perform positively: Africa (5.0%), Asia-Pacific (7.5%), Middle-East (5.5%), Latin
America (6.0%), North America (4.5%) and Europe (5.5%).

8.1.2 | Amadeus strategic priorities and expected business evolution in 2019

Amadeus is a leading technology provider for the travel industry. Amadeus has built commercial
relationships with players across the industry, including airlines, travel agencies, hotels and airports,
among others, and across the globe (with presence in more than 190 countries). Amadeus has invested
consistently over the years to have a unique technology offering. Having market leading and cutting-
edge technology allows us to serve our customers better, to customize more efficiently and to continue
innovating.

In Distribution, we see growth coming from adding travel providers and travel agencies to our network,
as well as from expanding the content offering distributed through Amadeus. In Airline IT, future growth
will be driven by (i) implementing new customers to our current solutions, (ii) increasing the
penetration of our solutions within our current customer base, and (iii) expanding our portfolio of
solutions to address customer needs. Additionally, we expect growth to come from our new businesses,
including Hospitality, Airport IT, Payments and Rail, as we progress in each of them.

In 2019, we expect to continue evolving positively. In Distribution, we expect to maintain our leadership
position, supported by our sustained investment in R&D and focus on innovation, global footprint, local
market understanding and industry expertise.

In Airline IT, our PSS business will continue to expand as we implement our upcoming, contracted
migrations, while also benefiting from the full-year impact of the 2018 customer implementations. This
is despite the full-year negative impact from LATAM Airlines Brasil (formerly TAM Airlines), which de-
migrated in 2018. Beyond the PSS business, we continue to invest on enhancing and expanding our
solutions portfolio in order to sustain our upselling activity, with particular focus on the areas of
merchandising, personalization, revenue optimization, digitalization, and disruption management.

In Hospitality IT, we have now fully implemented the first version of the Guest Reservation System with
InterContinental Hotels Group. In 2018, we also completed the acquisition of TravelClick, which
provides innovative cloud-based solutions, including an independent and mid-size hotel Central
Reservation System and Guest Management Solution, as well as business intelligence and media
solutions. During 2019, we will continue the process of integrating TravelClick’s solutions to the
Amadeus portfolio, while also continuing to invest in further product development, creating a
hospitality leader that provides a broad range of innovative technology to hotels and chains of all sizes
across the globe

Investing in technology is a key pillar to our success. In 2019, Amadeus will continue to invest in R&D
to support long term growth through new customer implementations, product evolution, portfolio
expansion (including non-air IT diversification) and cross-area technological projects. We will continue
investing for our NDC vision, which is to develop an integrated solution that can be widely adopted by
both travel agencies and airlines to deliver sustainable results on a scale that matters. Also, we will
progress on our shift to next-generation technologies and cloud services, as well as the application of
new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Amadeus has a proven track record of operating a solid and resilient business model that results in
strong cash generation, allowing for sustained investment in R&D and innovation, as well as for
shareholder remuneration, while maintaining a flexible capital structure. Ordinary dividends paid have
grown consistently every year since our IPO, at an average annual rate of 20% and we have
complemented this with share repurchases.

The Group has exposure, as a result of the normal course of its business activities, to foreign exchange,
interest rate, own shares price evolution, credit and liquidity risk. The goal of the Group is to identify
measure and minimize these risks using the most effective and efficient methods to eliminate, reduce,
or transfer such exposures. With the purpose of managing these risks, in some occasions, the Group
enters into hedging activities with derivatives and non-derivative instruments.

Page 44

T Group, S.A. a

Report for th

8.4.1 Foreign exchange rate risk

The reporting currency in the Group’s consolidated annual accounts is the Euro (EUR). As a result of the
multinational orientation of its business, the Group is subject to foreign exchange rate risks derived
from the fluctuations of many currencies. The target of the Group’s foreign exchange hedging strategy
is to reduce the volatility of the Euro value of the consolidated foreign currency denominated cash
flows. The instruments used to achieve this goal depend on the denomination currency of the operating
cash flow to be hedged:

— The strategy for US Dollar (USD) exposures is based on the use of natural hedges and
derivatives. This strategy aims at reducing the exposure created by the USD denominated
operating cash inflows of the Group with the USD payments of principals of the USD
denominated debt and with derivatives, although as of December 31, 2018, there was no
USD denominated debt.

— Aside from the USD, the foreign currency exposures are expenditures denominated in a
variety of foreign currencies. The most significant of these exposures are denominated in
Sterling Pounds (GBP), Indian Rupees (INR), Australian Dollars (AUD) and Singapore Dollars
(SGD). For these exposures, a natural hedge strategy is not possible. In order to hedge a
significant portion of the aforementioned short exposures (net expenditures) the Group
can engage into derivative contracts with banks: basically currency forwards, currency
options and combinations of currency options.

Provided that the objective in relation with the foreign exchange rate risk is to reduce the volatility of
the EUR value of the foreign currency denominated cash flows, the total exposure of the Group to
changes in the foreign exchange rates is measured in terms of Cash-flow at Risk (CFaR). This risk meas-
ure provides an estimate of the potential EUR loss of the foreign currency denominated cash flows from
the moment the estimation is calculated to the moment the cash flow is expected to take place. These
estimates are made using a 95% confidence level.

4

e CFaR methodology is similar in many respects to the Value at Risk (VaR) methodology. However,
whereas VaR is generally centered in the changes in the value of a portfolio of exposures in a given
future interval of time, CFaR is focused on the changes in the value of the cash-flows of that portfolio
from the calculation date to the moment in which these cash-flows are expected to effectively take
place. In the case of Amadeus CFaR is a more adequate measure of the risk of the Group given that the
goal of our risk management strategy with relation to foreign exchange risk is reducing the volatility of
the EUR value of the foreign currency denominated cash-flows. An additional reason for focusing on
cash-flows is that, eventually, the cash-flows of a company result in its level of liquidity which in the
case of a non-financial corporation it is generally a scarce and valuable element.

The main limitations of the CFaR methodology are very similar to the ones of the VaR methodology:

— Firstly, its results are based on several of hypotheses on the future volatilities of the
exchange rates and the future correlation among them which may correspond with the
real evolution of the exchange rates or not”

2 The volatilities implicit in the market prices of currency options and the historic correlations among the main currencies in which Amadeus
has exposures are used as inputs to the model.

Page 45


--- Page 44 ---

Amadeus IT Group, S.A. and Subsidiaries

Directors’ Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (millions of euros) a M a D E u S

— Additionally, the foreign exchange exposure estimates used as inputs to the model may
deviate with respect to the exposures which will finally take place in the future.

— Finally, it is important to mention that given a level of CFaR calculated with a 95% con-
fidence level, the losses which could take place in the remaining 5% of the cases may
be significantly greater than the level of risk as measured with the CFaR methodology
for a 95% confidence level.

The CFakR of the foreign exchange exposures of the Group calculated with a 95% confidence level is set
forth in the table below:

December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017

2019 CFaR 2020 CFaR 2021 CFaR 2018 CFaR 2019 CFaR 2020 CFaR

(10.3) (38.1) (90.0) (5.6) (24.4) (53.9)

There are two main reasons for the increase in the CFaR levels of the Group for the next three years
with respect to the CFaR levels outstanding at the end of 2017. On one side, the higher US Dollar expo-
sure as a consequence of the increased underlying exposures. Additionally, foreign exchange implicit
volatilities outstanding at the end of 2018 were higher than the ones used to make the calculation in
the previous year.

As it can be observed in the table above, the level of risk measured in CFaR terms tends to increase for
the periods which are further away. The reasons for this are: (1) the further away the future cash-flows
are, more adverse the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations can be potentially; (2) the level of hedging
is smaller for the later periods; and (3) in the later periods the size of the foreign exchange exposures
tends to be greater.

8.4.2 _ Interest rate risk

The objective of the Group in terms of interest rate risk management is reducing the volatility of the
net interest flows payable by the Group. In line with this goal as of December 2018 approximately 77%
(86%, 2017) of the debt contracted by the Group was fixed rate debt. No interest rate hedges were
hedging this debt as of December 2018 and December 2017.

The sensitivity of fair value of Amadeus debt to a 0.1% (10 bps) parallel shift of the interest rate curve
as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, is set forth in the table below:

?? In order to calculate the foreign currency exposures of the Group we take into account the estimated cash flows in each currency according
to the last available forecast and the foreign currency hedges contracted as of the CFaR calculation date

EUR denominated debt (10.5) (4.7)

EUR accounting hedges - - - .

Total 10.5 (10.5) 42 (4.7)

In 2018 there has been an increase in the sensitivity of the EUR denominated debt to the movements
of the interest rate curve with respect to the previous year. This increase is basically due to the issuance
of three new Eurobonds with a total notional of €1,500 million and maturities in 2022, 2023 and 2026.
This new debt increases both the total amount of outstanding debt and the average time to maturity
of the Amadeus’ debt. Although the future flows of the fixed rate debt instruments are not sensitive to
the changes in the level of interest rates, the fair value of the instruments is sensitive to these changes.

According to the table above a 10 bps drop in the level of interest rates would cause a loss in the fair
value of the debt (an increase of the liability) and the derivatives in the Amadeus hedging portfolio
amounting to €10.5 million at December 31, 2018 (€4.2 million, 2017). However, given that the changes
in the fair value of the derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recognized directly in equity
and the debt is measured at amortized cost, the impact of a 10 bps drop in the level of interest rates
would imply no loss recognized in the profit for the year at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

8.4.3. Own shares price evolution risk

As of December 31, 2018, the Group has three different remuneration schemes outstanding which are
settled with Amadeus shares; the Performance Share Plan (PSP), the Restricted Share Plan (RSP) and
the Share Match Plan (SMP).

According to the rules of these plans, when they mature their beneficiaries will receive a number of

Company’s shares which for the outstanding plans will be (depending on the evolution of certain per-

formance conditions) between a maximum of 1,565,000 shares and a minimum of 296,000 shares, ap-

proximately. It is Amadeus intention to make use of its 8,214,289 treasury shares to settle these plans
ity.

8.4.4 Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial asset will cause a loss for the Group by failing to
discharge an obligation.

Amadeus’ cash and cash equivalents are deposited in major banks on the basis of diversification and
the credit risk of the available investment alternatives.

The credit risk of Amadeus’ customer accounts receivable is mitigated by the fact that the majority are
settled through the clearing houses operated by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”)
and Airlines Clearing House, Inc. (“ACH”). These systems guarantee that the cash inflows from our cus-
tomers will be settled at a certain fixed date, and mitigate the credit risk partially by the fact that the

members of the clearing house are required to make deposits that would be used in the event of de-
fault. Moreover, our customer base is large and unrelated which results in a low concentration of our
credit risk.

8.4.5 Liquidity risk

The Corporate Treasury is responsible for providing the cash needed by all the companies of the Group.
In order to perform this task more efficiently, the Group concentrates the excess liquidity of the sub-
sidiaries and channel it to the companies with cash needs.

This allocation of the cash position among the companies of the Group is mainly made through:
— Acash pooling agreement with most of the subsidiaries located in the Euro area.

— Through bilateral Treasury Optimization agreements between Amadeus IT Group, S.A. and
its subsidiaries.

Corporate Treasury monitors the Group’s cash position through rolling forecasts of expected cash
flows. These forecasts are performed by the subsidiaries of the Group and later on consolidated in order
to examine both the liquidity situation and prospects of the Group and its subsidiaries.

The detail of the contractual maturities of the Group’s debt financing as of the end of the financial year
2018 is described in the note 17 “Current and non-current debt”.

In addition to other smaller treasury lines agreed with several banks, the Group has access to a Revolv-
ing Credit facility as detailed in note 17. The facility has a notional of €1,000.0 million and can be used
to cover working capital needs and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018, this facility
was fully unused and thus €1,000.0 million can be used to cover the liquidity needs of the Group (as of
December 31, 2017, there wasn’t any used amount either).

Finally, in August 2016, the notional of the Multi-Currency European Commercial Paper (ECP) program
was increased from €500.0 million up to €750.0 million. This program can be used for raising short term
financing. As of December 31, 2018, €330.0 million of this program were in use (€300.0 million, 2017).

8.5 Subsequent events

As of the date of issuance of this report no significant subsequent events have occurred after the
reporting period which might affect the Group and that should be disclosed.
