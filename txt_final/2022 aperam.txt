Annual Report 2022

Our history

On December 7, 2010, the Board of Directors of Aperam and the Board of Directors of ArcelorMittal
approved a proposal to its shareholders to spin-off ArcelorMittal’s stainless and specialty steels
businesses. The objective of establishing an independent company was to enable the stainless and
specialty steels businesses to benefit from better market visibility by pursuing a growth strategy focused on
emerging markets and specialty products, including electrical steel. On January 25, 2011, at an
extraordinary general meeting, the shareholders of ArcelorMittal voted to approve the spin-off proposal.
The main shareholder ("Significant Shareholder") holds 40.91% of the voting rights. Please refer to the
share capital section of this Management Report for the definition of the term "Significant shareholder". On
December 27, 2021, Aperam announced the completion of the acquisition of ELG, a global leader in
collecting, trading, processing and recycling of stainless steel scrap and high performance alloys.

Our operational organisation and facilities

In 2022, we managed our business according to four primary operating segments:

+ Stainless & Electrical Steel. We are a leading global producer of stainless steel by production capacity.
We produce a wide range of stainless and electrical steels (both Grain Oriented and Non-Grain
Oriented) and continuously expand our product offerings by developing new and higher grades of
stainless steel and electrical steel. The Stainless & Electrical Steel segment includes Aperam’s
Stainless Precision business.

This segment accounted for 38.4% of external sales and 73.5% of EBITDA for the year ending December
31, 2022, and 48.0% of external sales and 73.5% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2021.

+ Services & Solutions. Our Services & Solutions segment, which includes our tubes business, performs
three core activities: (i) the management of exclusive direct sales of stainless steel products from our
production facilities, primarily those located in Europe; (ii) distribution of our products and, to a much
lesser extent, external suppliers’ products; and (iii) transformation services, which include the provision
of value added and customised steel solutions through further processing to meet specific customer
requirements.

This segment accounted for 32.9% of external sales and 8.6% of EBITDA for the year ending December
31, 2022, and 41.8% of external sales and 17.5% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2021.

+ Alloys & Specialties. Our Alloys & Specialties segment is the fourth largest producer of specialty alloys
in the world. We specialise in the design, production and transformation of various specialty alloys and
certain specific stainless steels. Our products take the form of bars, semis, cold-rolled strips, wire and
wire rods, and plates and are offered in a wide range of grades.

This segment accounted for 8.1% of external sales and 4.9% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31,
2022, and 10.1% of external sales and 4.9% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2021.

+ Recycling & Renewables. Our new segment includes all recycling and renewable energy activities: (i)
ELG now called Aperam Recycling which is global leader in the trading, processing and recycling of raw
materials for the stainless steel industry as well as high performance materials such as superalloys and
titanium; (ii) Recyco which is our electric arc furnace recycling facility retrieving dust and sludge with the
aim of recycling stainless steel raw materials and reducing waste; and (iii) and Aperam BioEnergia,
which produces wood and charcoal (biomass) from cultivated eucalyptus forests in Brazil. We use the

3 Due to the transfer of Aperam BioEnergia, ASB Recycling and Recyco from the segment "Stainless & Electrical Steel" to the

segment "Recycling & Renewables" as from January 1, 2022, segmented figures for the year ending December 31, 2021 have
been recast accordingly.

charcoal (biomass) produced by Aperam BioEnergia as a substitute for coke at our Timdteo production
facility.

This segment accounted for 20.6% of external sales and 8.0% of EBITDA for the year ending December
31, 2022, and 0.1% of external sales and 11.9% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2021.

Additionally, we have EBITDA that is reported within our "Others and Eliminations" segment. This segment
includes corporate costs and elimination between our primary operating segments. EBITDA for “Others
and Eliminations” accounted for 5.0% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2022, and (7.8)% of
EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2021.

South America

We are the only producer of flat stainless and electrical steel in South America. Our integrated production
facility in Timoteo, Brazil, produces a wide range of stainless, electrical steel and special carbon products,
which account for approximately 35% of the Stainless & Electrical Steel operating segment’s total
shipments. Steel shipments from Stainless & Electrical Steel Brazil facilities represented 626 thousand
tonnes in 2021 and 593 thousand tonnes in 2022.

The Timdteo integrated production facility includes two blast furnaces, one melting shop area (including
two electrical furnaces, two converters and two continuous casting machines), one hot rolling mill
(including one walking beam and one pusher furnace with one rougher mill and one steckel mill), a
stainless cold rolling shop (including one hot annealing and pickling line, two cold annealing and pickling
lines, one cold preparation line, three cold rolling mills and four batch annealing furnaces) and an electrical
steel cold rolling shop (including one hot annealing and pickling line, two tandem annealing lines, one
decarburising line, one thermo-flattening and carlite coating line, one cold rolling mill and 20 batch
annealing furnaces). Aperam South America also has a unique capability to produce stainless and
specialty steel by using charcoal from our sustainably cultivated forests in Brazil with low dependence on
external sources for coke and energy.

The year of 2022 was unique for Aperam South America, specially for two achievements:
+ ahistoric landmark of our safety, where it completes one calendar year without Lost Time Injuries
(LTI). This important milestone is the result of the commitment, dedication and effort of our
employees and their tireless work to ensure a safe and healthy environment;

14


--- Page 6 ---

Annual Repo! 2

+ — the confirmation of our contribution to the circular economy in the world. More than neutralizing its
emissions, by absorbing more CO2 than it emits, Aperam South America has been acknowledged
as carbon neutral from the cultivation of renewable eucalyptus forests, which is a great differential;
it is the first company in the world, in the special flat steel segment, to achieve carbon neutrality in
scopes 1 and 2.

“This is the second year in a row of relevant investments, which shows the belief of our company and our
group in each one of us. We made an entire inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from the Industry and
the BioEnergia unit and analyzed the removals, which our forests remove from gasses from the
atmosphere. With this it was possible to obtain the result in which emissions are totally neutralized by our
removals", pointed out the CEO of Aperam South America and BioEnergia, Frederico Ayres Lima.

Aperam continues its commitment to the most demanding international standards and has made this effort
a long-term and global one with several certification processes achieved and done. The most relevant for
the Minimum Safeguards of the Taxonomy regulation is certainly the ResponsibleSteel™ membership and
certification campaign which has been extended to Aperam South America currently going through the
audit process with the final certification decision achieved beginning 2023.

Aperam Stainless & Electrical - Timdteo plant

Services & Solutions

We predominantly sell and distribute our products through our Services & Solutions segment, which also
includes our tubes business. The segment provides value added and customised steel solutions through
further processing in very short lead time and high service level to meet specific customer requirements.
Our distribution network comprises 15 steel service centres, 5 transformation facilities and 15 sales offices
with a global presence. Steel shipments from the Services and Solutions division represented 642
thousand tonnes in 2022 and 726 thousand tonnes in 2021.

Recycling & Renewables

Aperam Recycling & Renewables is our fourth segment established in 2022 which combines the three
recycling and renewable energy generating entities Aperam Recycling, Recyco and BioEnergia.

Aperam Recycling

Aperam Recycling (former ELG) is a global leader in the trading, processing and recycling of raw materials
for the stainless steel industry as well as high performance materials such as superalloys and titanium.
With 51 locations in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and South Africa, Aperam has with Aperam
Recycling one of the largest global networks of the Stainless Recycling industry.

Aperam Recycling’s product lines include stainless steel, special metals and superalloys scrap. Aperam
Recycling’s customers, primarily stainless steel producers as well as manufacturers from the aviation
industry, receive the material in exactly the composition and form that meet their requirements.

Aperam Recycling is an integral part of the stainless steel and superalloys value chain, forming the link
between industrial customers, local scrap handlers and mills & melt shops that purchase globally. To
achieve this, Aperam Recycling works with more than 4,000 trusted suppliers in order to source small- and
medium-sized lots of material of manifold compositions and qualities. Aperam Recycling’s value creation
consists of transforming a heterogeneous collection of materials into a tailor-made, homogenous, and
constant stream of valuable raw material to be used by its global customers. Especially in the stainless and
superalloys segments, Aperam Recycling has developed sophisticated analytical methods, innovative
techniques and services to meet the demanding quality standards of its customers.

Aperam Recycling continuously contribute to reduce the stream of metal waste: 1.4 million tonnes of
recycled raw material were shipped in 2022 to be transformed into new products.

Recyco

Recyco, our electric arc furnace recycling facility located in France (Isbergues), is dedicated to recovering
and treating the metallic content from melting shop dust and sludge. Re-using the furnace of a former melt
shop, we treat these residues and extract the valuable metallic content to send it back for reuse.

Aperam BioEnergia

The charcoal produced at BioEnergia is used in our steel-making process as a natural and renewable
substitute for fossil fuels (coke). This allows us to entirely eradicate the use of extractive coke and makes

17

Annual Repo! 2

our steel a leader in terms of CO2 footprint. Our forest is continuously cultivated and maintained and is
actually carbon positive, which means it is acting as a carbon sink. This is why our BioEnergia unit is a
source of pride for our teams, who are keen to promote our products with ‘green’ labels.

Our forest management is based on best practices and is recognized by the Forest Stewardship
Council®’s (FSC®) certification, whose standards and principles conciliate ecological protection (flora and
fauna, but also water reserves) with social benefits and economic feasibility.

Our carbonization process doesn’t use any extractive fuels and is realised with extraordinary energy
efficiency, reusing the heat and gases generated by incineration to dry the wood. Thanks to this
responsible and sustainable process, all the charcoal is produced efficiently and is sent to the furnaces of
the Aperam Brazilian steel plant, located in the same state, in the city of Timdteo, some 350 kilometers
away.

Annual Report 2022

Market analysis

Market environment

Our operational results are primarily affected by external factors that impact the stainless and specialty steel
industry in general and, in particular, stainless and electrical steel pricing, demand for stainless and specialty
steels, production capacity, trends in raw material, energy prices, and fluctuations in exchange rates. In
addition to these external factors, our operational results are affected by certain factors specific to Aperam,
including several initiatives we introduced in response to the challenging economic environment. These
factors are described in greater detail below.

After Gross Domestic Product and Industrial Production sharply recovered in 2021 from COVID-19 shock in
the previous year, 2022 saw a progressive deterioration of the macroeconomic environment induced by
booming inflation and the consequences of the war in Ukraine. Activity in China was also subdued by the real
estate crisis and a tough Zero-Covid policy which affected consumption, logistics and overall industrial activity.

In the EU, economic and industrial growth remained strong at the beginning of 2022, before gradually
deteriorating, impacted by booming energy costs, inflation and rising interest rates. Dynamics vary across
euro area with Germany, being more exposed to Russia limitation on gas supply, impacting its industrial
activity. Although inflation started to slow down, it remains much higher than the central bank’s target and
interest rate may keep increasing in 2023. Energy prices could remain very volatile and the evolution of the
conflict between Russia and Ukraine is uncertain.

For Brazil in 2022 GDP growth was mainly supported by services, as the restrictions imposed by covid-19
vanished since 2021. Household consumption is expected to be in 2022 at a higher level than in 2021.
Industry in general will give a modest contribution in economic growth. Despite signs of gradual normalisation,
the manufacturing industry is still facing production cost pressures and shortage of some raw materials as an
effect of unbalanced global supply and logistic chains. For commodities prices, drop in iron ore international
prices in 2022 limited export revenues. Jobs creation in the labour market got stronger in 2022. Concerning
apparent consumption of flat steels in 2022, despite the drop over 2021, the figures of stainless are still in the
highest historical levels. The electrical steel apparent consumption showed stability when compared to 2021,
but at a high level when compared to the previous years. The grain oriented electrical steel consumption is
strongly correlated with the electricity consumption and the projections for 2022 show some small increase
from the past years.

China was affected in 2022 by a real estate crisis, which in previous years was a major engine for the
economic growth, and a zero-Covid policy that disrupted logistics and production, affecting consumers’
confidence and consumption. These factors led to a high volatility of stainless steel prices and pushed China
to increase exports to offset the lower domestic consumption.

Stainless steel pricing

The stainless steel market is a global market. Stainless steel is suitable for transport over long distances, as
logistics costs represent a small proportion of overall costs. As a result, prices for commoditised stainless
steel products evolve similarly across regions. However, in general, stainless steel products are not
completely fungible due to wide variations in shape, chemical composition, quality, specifications and
application, availability of local raw material and purchase conditions - all of which impact sales prices.
Accordingly, there remains a limited market for uniform pricing or exchange trading of certain stainless steel
products.

Stainless steel is a steel alloy with a minimum of 10.5% chromium content by mass and a combination of
alloys that are added to confer certain specific properties depending on the application. The cost of alloys

19


--- Page 11 ---

Annual Report 2022

used in stainless steel products varies across products and can fluctuate significantly. Prices of stainless steel
in Europe and the United States are concluded as either fixed prices or generally include two components :

+ the "base price", which is negotiated with customers and depends on market supply and demand; and

+ the “alloy surcharge", which is a supplementary charge to the selling price of steel that offsets the
purchase price increases in raw materials, such as nickel, chromium or molybdenum, by directly
passing these increases onto customers. The concept of the “alloy surcharge", which is calculated
using raw material purchase prices, among which some are quoted on certain accepted exchanges
like the London Metals Exchange (LME), was introduced in Europe and the United States in response
to significant volatility in the price of these materials.

Notwithstanding the application of the "alloy surcharge", the Group is still affected by changes in raw material
prices. This is particularly true for nickel, which in the last decade experienced some sudden spikes, before
coming back to a lower level. In general, when the price of nickel is falling, purchasers delay ordering
stainless steel products in order to benefit from expected price decreases. This in turn has the effect of
reducing demand in the short term. By contrast, when nickel prices are rising, purchasers tend to acquire
larger quantities of stainless steel in order to avoid having to buy at higher prices.

Globally, stainless steel prices in 2022 can be split into two periods; prices increasing to very high level at the
beginning of the year, supported by strong demand, long lead-time and booming nickel prices. From the end
of Q2 2022, weakening of global demand and oversupply in China resulting from Covid lockdowns led to a
collapse of prices. In Europe, healthy demand in the first part of 2022, plus higher raw material and energy
costs, pushed prices at a multi year high. Prices collapsed thereafter due to weakening demand, high stocks
and very competitive price from Asian imports.

The graphs below show the price of nickel on the London Metals Exchange and the European transaction
price for Cold Rolled 304 stainless steel for the period running from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022:

Nickel prices have been derived from the LME. Stainless steel/CR304 2B 2mm transaction domestic, delivered North Europe have been derived from
Fastmarkets.

Raw material prices are described in more detail in the “Raw Materials and Energy” section below.

Electrical steel pricing

The prices of electrical steels for Grain Oriented (GO) and Non Grain Oriented steels (NGO) are affected by
global demand and supply dynamics. In 2022, prices reflected the tight supply in Asia but also the logistics
constraints as with most of the steel products mainly on H122. Non Grain Oriented prices were still affected by
rising demand of Electric-Vehicles (EV) and partial migration of Non Grain Oriented producers mainly in
Europe and Asia, shifting production for less productivity grades to supply EV motors demand. In Grain
Oriented prices were also affected by an increasing demand for transformers worldwide, mainly in Asia for
electrification.

Demand for stainless and electrical steel and
specialty alloys products

Demand for stainless and electrical steel, which represents approximately 2.5% of the global steel market by
volume, is affected to a significant degree by trends in the global economy and industrial production. Short-
term demand is also affected by fluctuations in nickel prices, as discussed in greater detail in the "Stainless
Steel Pricing" section above.

Global apparent consumption of stainless steel experienced a decline in 2022 compared to 2021 volumes,
mainly driven by China which saw the first contraction of stainless steel consumption in more than a decade.
In Europe, consumption remained high during the first half of the year and then demand collapsed due to high
stocks and weakening consumption. China’s exports kept increasing in 2022, thanks to competitive export
price to offset the decline of domestic consumption. Nevertheless, with China adding some slab capacities
despite weaker demand the effective slab capacity utilization rate dropped below 80% in 2022 compared to
91% in 2021. In Brazil, the apparent consumption had a negative impact of the supply chain destocking.
Compared to 2021, the drop reached -10 percentage points. Slow down of consumer goods segments as
white goods, cutlery and domestic appliances due to inflation levels, but also a recovery of Services share on
GDP supported the drop in real demand.

With respect to electrical steel, Asia is the most important source of demand but also supply, and as a
consequence its prices are dependent in particular upon the Asian context. The removal of exports rebate in

21


--- Page 13 ---

Annual Report 2022

China, as well as the difficulties in exports due to logistics constraints in Asia affected the international prices
environment.

During 2022, Aerospace was a major Ni alloy demand driver in the specialty alloys markets. In parallel,
increased construction rates for producers due to supply chain replenishment also resulted in a double digit
growth (+16%). For Oil/Gas, recovery ran until the end of 2022. Although the LNG marine market was at a
lower cycle, LNG demand will continue to grow and shipyards are expected to be full until end 2025, thus
amplifying demand for Ni alloy. For Automotive, in spite of supply chain issues, the automotive market grew
this year after several years of declines— except for combustion engine vehicles, which are relevant for Ni
alloy demand. As for Power Generation, year to date orders for Land-Based Gas Turbines (LBGT) remained
surprisingly weak. Other sub-segments (including the new hydrogen demand) can however partly compensate
for the stagnant Ni alloy demand for LBGT. Electronic Alloys has grown in line with consumer goods
development (a constant as consumer goods even kept growing in 2020 during the COVID-crisis), inflation
could however negatively impact it in 2023.

Production and capacity

In 2022, global stainless steel production dropped, driven by a contraction of demand in China and, with
smaller volume, in Europe.

Global cold rolled stainless steel production is estimated to have declined by 2% in 2022 and by 3.5% in
Europe. China experienced a decline of 2% of cold rolled and 5% of slabs production. 2023 is expected to see
a rebound globally, primarily driven by China which is expected to see a rebound of activity along the year
now that Covid policy has been eased. Nevertheless, the magnitude of this rebound will also depend on the
situation of the real-estate sector in China and demand in developed countries in a context of inflation, high
and volatile energy costs and more restrictive monetary policy from central banks.

The global structural overcapacity is estimated to have strongly increased in 2022 due to new capacities
added by China while demand declined. Cold rolled overcapacity in China is estimated to have doubled, from
2.3 to 3.8 million tonnes between 2021 and 2022. Both on the upstream and downstream, new capacities are
under construction and have been announced by Chinese companies and should result in another increase of
overcapacities in the coming years.

Overall, import pressure in Europe continues despite safeguard measures and anti-dumping duties, not only
because of higher energy and production costs in Europe, but also because of new cold rolling lines which
could circumvent this trade defense. The European Commission announced anti-dumping duties on cold-
rolled stainless steel imports from Indonesia and India. The steel safeguard measures are implemented until
June 30th, 2024.

Competition

Aperam is a leading flat stainless steel producer in South America, the second largest producer in Europe and
one of the top ten flat stainless steel producers in the world. The largest stainless steel producers are Chinese
companies who benefited from the exponential growth of their domestic market to expand capacities.

Developments regarding trade measures

Last years were marked by extensive developments in respect to trade measures, as described in greater
detail below.

1. Safeguard measures on import of steel products

The EU has prolonged for three additional years the safeguard measure currently in place on imports of
certain steel products. The prolongation applies from July 1, 2021. The initial safeguard measure was
introduced in July 2018 to protect the Union steel market against trade diversion, following the US decision to
impose, under its Section 232 legislation, duties on imports of steel into the US market. The US Section 232
measures are still in force.

On June 25, 2021, the European Commission published amending Commission Implementing Regulation
(EU) 2019/159 to prolong the safeguard measure on imports of certain steel products. These measures took
effect on July 1, 2021, for a period of three years, expiring on July 30, 2024.

On December 17th, 2021, the Commission has opened the expected safeguard review on the TRQ
functioning and impact of the EU-US S232 deal.

Anti-dumping measures on cold rolled stainless steel originating in China and Taiwan, India and Indonesia,
and on hot rolled stainless steel originating in China, Taiwan and Indonesia continue during the imposition of
safeguard measures.

Once the quota is filled, to avoid the imposition of double remedies, the highest level of safeguard or the anti-
dumping and/or anti-subsidies duties are to be applied.

On December 2, 2022, the Commission has opened the expected safeguard review, to determine whether the
safeguard measure should be terminated by June 30, 2023, which is one year earlier than its otherwise

current duration. In line with its commitment under the Prolongation Regulation, the review investigation will
focus on collecting and analysing any relevant evidence and data to determine whether it would be justified to
terminate the measure by June 30, 2023. To that end, the Commission deems it necessary to collect certain
specific information via questionnaires (see Section 2 below).

In addition, considering that the Commission used data pertaining to the year 2021 in the last review in order
to update the list of developing countries subject to the measure, the Commission may also use this review to
update such a list in view of the data for 2022.

6. World Trade Organization challenge against Indonesian restrictions on raw materials

On November 22, 2019, the European Union brought a dispute in the World Trade Organization (WTO)
against Indonesian export restrictions for raw materials used in production of stainless steel.

These restrictions unfairly limit access of international producers to raw materials for steel production, notably
nickel. The European Union is also challenging subsidies that encourage use of local content by Indonesian
producers and give preference to domestic over imported goods, which goes against WTO rules.

On January 14, 2021, the European Union requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on January
25, 2021, the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) deferred the establishment of a panel.

At its meeting on February 22, 2021, the Dispute Settlement Body established a panel. Brazil, Canada, China,
India, Japan, Korea, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Turkey, Ukraine, the
United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States reserved their third-party rights.

On April 19, 2021, the European Union requested the Director-General to compose the panel.

On April 29, 2021, the Director-General composed the panel.

On November 1, 2021, the Chair of the panel informed the DSB that, in accordance with the timetable
adopted thus far following consultations with the parties, the panel estimated that it would issue its final report
to the parties in the last quarter of 2022.

For further details please refer to the following link:
https://www.wto.org/english/tratop e/dispu_e/cases e/ds592 e.htm

On November 30, 2022, the Panel report on the Indonesian nickel ore export restriction was released.

With respect to the Domestic Processing Requirement (DPR), the Panel was of the view that because Article
XI:1 also covers measures prohibiting or restricting “sale for export” it applied to domestic regulations such as
the DPR that prevent or limit the ability to sell goods for export even if they apply internally within the exporting
Member.

The Panel found that the export ban was a prohibition on the export of nickel ore.

The Panel concluded that as the DPR by its nature restricted the sale for export of nickel ore, it was fell within
the scope of the obligation in Article XI:1 of the GATT 1994.

Following the circulation of the Panel report on the Indonesian nickel ore policy, Indonesia has notified an
appeal against the report on December 12, 2022.

7. Anti-circumvention investigation on imports of stainless steel hot-rolled flat products (SSHR)
originating in Turkey

On June 16, Eurofer lodged the request to COM for the initiation of an anti-circumvention investigation on
imports of SSHR products originating in Turkey.

The measure circumvented via the imports from Turkey is Commission implementing Regulation (EU)
2020/1408 of 6 October 2020 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of SSHR originating in
Indonesia, the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan.

On July 26, 2022 the Commission published in the Official Journal the Regulation through which it opens the
anti-circumvention investigation on imports of SSHR from Turkey and registers imports from that country.

Brazil

Since 2013, Brazil's Trade Defence Department (Decom), an investigative body under the Brazilian Ministry
of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade, opened anti-dumping investigations against imports from
several countries for welded austenitic stainless pipes, flat stainless steel products and flat non-grain oriented
products, imposing anti-dumping duties for a period of five years. In 2021, an anti-dumping investigation and
an anti-subsidy investigation was also opened against Indonesia. On November 5, 2021, stainless steel
import duties were reduced from 14% to 12.6%. On December 2, 2022 Brazilian Trade Defense authority
published final determination on anti-subsidies duties for Stainless Flat Cold Rolled 304 grades from
Indonesia, of 18,79% on top of CIF prices All the current measures are described below.

Raw materials and Energy

Raw materials

Stainless and specialty steel production requires substantial amounts of raw materials (primarily nickel,
chromium, molybdenum, stainless and carbon steel scrap, charcoal (biomass) and iron ore). With the
exception of charcoal, which is produced internally, we are exposed to price uncertainty with respect to each
of these raw materials, which we typically purchase under short-term and long-term supply contracts, as well
as on the spot market.

Prices for these raw materials are strongly correlated with demand for stainless steel and carbon steel and
thus tend to fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand. In addition, since most of the raw
materials we use are finite resources, their prices may also fluctuate in response to any perceived scarcity of
reserves, along with the development of projects working to replace depleted reserves.

Annual Report 2022

The London Metal Exchange (LME) nickel price started 2022 at a level of U.S.$21,137 per tonne and
continued the strong performance of 2021, helped by a continued positive market sentiment as the Covid
pandemic was fading away. But early March the LME nickel price showed a sudden increase in both price and
volatility, culminating in the collapse of the LME trading mechanism on March 7, 2022 when initially a price of
over U.S.$100,000 per tonne was reached before the LME stopped the nickel trade and reversed all
ransactions on that day. The cash settlement price of March 7 was finally recorded at U.S.$42,995 per tonne,
a price level not seen since May 2007. At the origin of the LME fiasco was apparently an attempt to cover a
big short position taken by an Asian party. The LME Nickel trade was interrupted till March 23, when the cash
settlement price was set at U.S.$30,800 per tonne. The LME suspended overnight trading and set a rule that
rade would be stopped whenever an intraday price change would exceed 15%. This still happened some
days in March and only on March 28, a more or less normal trade was established, albeit with much lower
volumes compared to the period before the March 7 event. Many market participants lost faith in the LME
rading system as many of them were confronted with very high margin calls. Investigations by the LME and
its controlling bodies are still ongoing at time of this report. Following the LME debacle, The LME nickel price
traded for a while around U.S.$35,000 per tonne but then started to decline as of late April to reach a low point
for the year of U.S.$19,385 per tonne on July 15, 2022. The LME nickel price then started to trade in a range
of U.S.$20,0000 to U.S.$25,000 per tonne till early November. Despite recession fears the LME nickel price
started to rise again and ended the year at a level of U.S.$31,118 per tonne on December 31, after 2 months
with low liquidity and very high intraday volatility. The LME nickel stocks continued their descent which started
already in early 2021. On January 4, the total LME nickel stocks stood at 101,136 tonnes and reached a low
of 49,470 tonnes on November 18, to slightly recover to 55,380 tonnes on December 30, 2022.

In the first quarter of 2022, the European ferrochrome benchmark was rolled over from the previous quarter at
U.S.$1.80 per pound of chrome in the first quarter as the supply and demand moved into a more balanced
situation. On rising power costs in South Africa, combined with still excellent demand in Europe and USA, the
European ferrochrome benchmark reached an all time high of U.S.$2.16 per pound of chrome in the second
quarter of 2023. But as global, and in particular Chinese, stainless steel production fell sharply in the second
half of 2022, the European ferrochrome benchmark price dropped to U.S.$1.80 per pound of chrome in the
third quarter and fell further to U.S.$1.49 per pound of chrome in the fourth quarter.

Supported by a negative supply demand balance in 2021 and early 2022, molybdenum prices continued to
trade around U.S.$42 per kilogram from January to May 2022. As of June, molybdenum prices started to
weaken as China turned into a net exporter in the first half of 2022 after having imported massive amounts of
molybdenum in 2021. As demand weakened following reduced stainless steel production in the third quarter, a
low of U.S.$31 per kilogram was reached in early August 2022. But as of then, good demand from military
applications, oil & gas and new energy investments, combined with lower by-product output in copper mines of
South America, supported a continuous price rally till the year end when the molybdenum price reached U.S.
$66 per kilogram, the highest level since 2008.

Ferrous scrap prices showed a very volatile pattern in the first half of 2022 with a price of U.S.$450 per tonne
at the start of January followed by a sharp increase in early March to U.S.$663.5 per tonne and staying at that
level till mid April. This peak was the highest in more than 12 years and could be explained by a strong
recovery of the construction, automotive and machinery sectors after the 2020 Covid pandemic. However as
energy prices exploded after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, demand from the power intensive carbon steel
industry collapsed as significant capacity was closed. As a result, the price dropped very fast, down to U.S.
$315 per tonne by the end of June 2022. Despite a few upticks to U.S.$400 per tonne in July and September
the ferrous scrap price could not really recover and ended the year at U.S.$394 per tonne.

Energy

Inflationary pressures on energy were already imminent in last year’s rapid economic recovery from the
pandemic. This turned into a global energy crisis after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting
curtailments of natural gas supply to Europe exposing customers to high energy bills and supply shortages.

29


--- Page 21 ---

Annual Report 2022

Volatility was additionally fuelled by the drought over summer in several countries and the ongoing outages
and repairs with numerous delays at the majority of the French nuclear reactor fleet.

Spot prices for natural gas TTF peaked with a monthly average of 232 €/MWh in August 2022 and closed the
year with an average of 121 €/MWh, increasing around 150% YoY. With natural gas still accounting for 25% of
European electricity generation and CCGT power plants being the marginal cost producers, also electricity
prices peaked in August (Belgium 448 and France 492 €/MWh). Annual averages were 245 and 276 €/MWh in
Belgium and France, an increase of around 150% YoY and around 6-7 times higher than the historic average
during the last decade.

With regard to natural gas, the Timdteo production facility in Brazil has a natural gas supply contract with a
Brazilian supplier. In Europe, the Group has purchased most of its natural gas through a supply contract put in
place with ArcelorMittal Energy S.C.A. in 2015.

For electricity in France, a supply contract was put in place with ArcelorMittal Energy S.C.A. at the beginning
of 2016, whereas in Belgium such a contract has been in place since the beginning of 2015. In Brazil,
electricity needs are mainly secured through long-term contracts with a couple of suppliers, with balancing
requirements managed through short-term arrangements.

With regard to industrial gases, the Group procures its industrial gas requirements using short- or long-term
contracts with various suppliers in different geographical regions.

As a stainless steel producing company, Aperam is a large consumer of electricity and natural gas and
manages its energy needs through a mix of forward hedges, spot and fixed price contracts. Therefore the
energy and natural gas inflation had an impact during the whole year 2022 and especially during market price
peak in summer. In this environment, we also sought to balance higher costs with efficiency gains and
accelerated procurement of electricity from renewables mainly from on-site installations. This shows how
important our 30% energy reduction target to 2030 is and that investments in energy savings have potentially
high returns.

Impact of exchange rate movements

At the end of 2021, the Euro amounted to 1.1326 U.S. dollar/Euro and 6.3210 Brazilian real/Euro. In 2022, the
Euro depreciated by 5.8% against the U.S. dollar to reach 1.0666 U.S. dollar/Euro. In 2022, the Euro
depreciated by 11.9% against the Brazilian real to reach 5.5694 Brazilian real/Euro.

Because a substantial portion of Aperam's assets, liabilities, sales and earnings are denominated in
currencies other than the Euro (see presentation currency), Aperam is exposed to fluctuations in the values of
these currencies relative to the Euro. These currency fluctuations, especially the fluctuation of the Euro
relative to the U.S. dollar and Brazilian real, as well as fluctuations in the currencies of the other countries in
which Aperam has significant operations and sales, can have a material impact on the results of operations.
To minimise its currency exposure, the Group enters into hedging transactions to lock in a set exchange rate
for specific transactions in non-local currencies, in accordance with its management policies.

The Group’s operating income for the year ending December 31, 2022, was €890 million, compared to an
operating income of €1,042 million for the year ending December 31, 2021. Group operating income
decreased by 14.6%. Excluding exceptional losses of €(53) million related to the reversal of the inventory
step-up of €(48) million recognized in the 2021 bargain purchase gain on ELG acquisition and a final bargain
purchase gain adjustment on this acquisition for €(5) million in 2022 and exceptional gains of €126 million
made of a bargain gain on ELG acquisition of €117 million and PIS/Cofins tax credits related to prior periods
recognized in Brazil for €9 million in 2021, group operating income increased by 2.9% as the first time
consolidation of ELG and higher realized prices compensated lower steel shipments, cost inflation and
significant inventory valuation charges. Phase 4 of the Leadership Journey® - the Transformation Program -
realized €82 million gains in 2022.

Stainless & Electrical Steel

The operating income for the Stainless & Electrical Steel segment was €689 million for the year ending
December 31, 2022, of which an operating income of €321 million was attributable to our operations in Europe
and €368 million was attributable to our operations in South America. This is compared to operating income of
€774 million for the year ending December 31, 2021, of which an operating income of €384 million was
attributable to our operations in Europe and €390 million was attributable to our operations in South America.
The decrease of the operating income by 11% was mainly driven by the combined effect of lower volumes and
inventory valuation charges.

Services & Solutions

The operating income for the Services & Solutions segment was €79 million for the year ending December 31,
2022, compared to operating income of €196 million for the year ending December 31, 2021. The lower
operating income was mainly attributable to lower shipments, inventory valuation charges and an
unfavourable price/cost development.

Alloys & Specialties

The operating income for the Alloys & Specialties segment was €44 million for the year ending December 31,
2022, compared to operating income of €50 million for the year ending December 31, 2021. The decrease is
mainly attributable to inventory valuation charges and lower shipments.

Recycling & Renewables

The operating income for the Recycling & Renewables segment was €27 million for the year ending
December 31, 2022, including an exceptional loss of EUR (53) million related to the reversal of the inventory
step-up of EUR (48) million recognized in the 2021 bargain purchase gain on ELG acquisition and a final
bargain purchase gain adjustment on this acquisition for EUR (5) million. The operating income for the
Recycling & Renewables segment was a €117 million for the year ending December 31, 2021, including an
exceptional gain of €117 million made from a bargain gain on ELG acquisition.

Financing income / (costs)

Financing income / (costs) include interest income, interest expense, net foreign exchange and derivative
results and other net financing costs. Financing costs, net were €(137) million for the year ending December
31, 2022, compared to financing income of €2 million for the year ending December 31, 2021.

Excluding the foreign exchange and derivative results described below, net interest expense and other
financing costs for the year ending December 31, 2022 were €(15) million, compared to net interest expense
and other financing costs below €1 million for the year ending December 31, 2021, including an exceptional
interest income of €7 million in Brazil for PIS/Cofins tax credits related to prior periods.

Net interest expense and other financing costs also includes recurring financing costs of €(15) million for the
year ending December 31, 2022, of which cash costs of financing of €(9) million, compared to recurring
financing costs of €(9) million for the year ending December 31, 2021, of which cash costs of financing of €(7)
million. Cash costs of financing are made of interests and other expenses related to the service of debt and
other financing facilities.

Realised and unrealised foreign exchange and derivative gains/losses were a loss of €(122) million for the
year ending December 31, 2022, mainly driven by unrealized results on nickel derivatives and realized results
on foreign exchange derivatives compensated primarily via operating results on higher foreign exchange
denominated sales , compared to realised and unrealised foreign exchange and derivative gains of €2 million
for the year ending December 31, 2021. Foreign exchange results primarily relate to the accounting
revaluation of non-Euro assets, liabilities, sales and earnings. Results on derivatives primarily relate to the
financial instruments entered into in order to hedge our exposure to nickel prices but which do not qualify for
hedge accounting treatment under IFRS 9.

Income Tax

We recorded an income tax expense of €(126) million for the year ending December 31, 2022, compared to
an income tax expense of €(74) million for the year ending December 31, 2021. Our 2022 income tax expense
was primarily due to positive operational results in several countries. Despite the fact that, similarly to 2021,
the income tax expense was positively impacted by additional recognition of deferred tax assets on tax
attributes in several jurisdictions, the income tax expense increased due to less favourable mix of the portion
of profit before tax generated in lower versus higher tax rate jurisdictions for the year ending December 31,
2022 compared to the year ending December 31, 2021. The effective tax rate for the year ending December
31, 2022 was 17% compared to the effective tax rate of 7% for the year ending December 31, 2021.

Liquidity
Liquidity and capital resources

The Group’s principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from its operations and its credit facilities at the
corporate level.

Because Aperam S.A. is a holding company, it is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of, and
dividends and distributions from, its operating subsidiaries to pay expenses and meet its debt service
obligations.

In management's opinion, the Group’s operations and credit facilities described below are sufficient to meet
the Group’s present requirements.

Our cash and cash equivalents amounted to €457 million and €524 million as of December 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, respectively.

Our total gross debt, which includes long and short-term debt, was €925 million and €990 million as of
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, Aperam had €126
million out of the total gross debt of €925 million outstanding at the subsidiary level (including €97 million of
finance leases).

Net financial debt, defined as long-term debt plus short-term debt less cash and cash equivalents (including
short-term investments), was €468 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to €466 million at December
31, 2021.

Gearing, defined as net financial debt divided by total equity, was 14% as of December 31, 2022, compared to
16% as of December 31, 2021.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a total liquidity of €984 million, consisting of cash and cash
equivalents (including short term investments) of €457 million, committed credit lines of €500 million
(unsecured revolving credit facility of €500 million) at Aperam SA level and €27 million of committed credit

equivalents (including short term investments) of €524 million, committed credit lines of €300 million (revolving

Financing

Unsecured revolving credit facility

On February 11, 2022, Aperam announced having entered into a 5+1+1 years sustainably linked senior
unsecured revolving credit facility (“The Facility”) of €500 million with a syndicate of 16 banks. Such Facility
replaced the senior unsecured revolving credit facility of €300 million signed in June 2017. In addition, Aperam
announced having entered into a 6 years sustainably linked amortizing fixed rate term facility of €300 million
with a syndicate of 10 banks (“The Loan”). The Facility is for general corporate purposes and the Loan is
dedicated to the refinancing of maturing debts of ELG. The pricing of financing contracts is linked to two
strategic commitments of the company being firstly to become a best-in-class stainless steel manufacturer in
terms of Health & Safety by constantly outperforming its industrial average in terms of Health & Safety metrics
and to maintain its leadership in low carbon steel-making by setting an ambitious decarbonisation trajectory.

The Facility and the Loan contain a financial covenant being a maximum consolidated total debt of 90% of
consolidated tangible net worth. On December 31, 2022, this financial covenant was fully met.

Annual Report 2022

The Facility was fully undrawn and the Loan was fully drawn.
EIB financings

On June 27, 2016, Aperam and the European Investment Bank (EIB) announced the signing of a financing
contract in the amount of €50 million, which will be dedicated to financing a research and development
programme over the 2016-2019 period, as well as an upgrade of two plants located in cohesion regions in
France & Belgium (Isbergues, Hauts-de-France and Chatelet, Hainaut respectively). This project was funded
under the Investment Plan for Europe, also known as the "Juncker Plan”. The financing contract, which is
senior unsecured, was entirely drawn down on October 16, 2018, at a rate of 1.669%, with a final maturity
date of October 16, 2028.

On February 25, 2019, the Company announced the signature of a financing contract where the EIB will make
available to Aperam an amount of €100 million. The purpose of this contract is the financing of ongoing
investments in the cold rolling and annealing & pickling lines at Aperam’s Genk plant (Belgium), as well as the
Company’s ongoing modernisation programmes in the cohesion regions of Hauts-de-France (France) -
Isbergues plant, and Hainaut (Belgium) - Chatelet plant. The financing contract, which is senior unsecured,
was entirely drawn down on March 15, 2019, at a rate of 1.307%, with a final maturity date of March 15, 2029.

On September 30, 2020, Aperam strengthened its liquidity profile with the signature of a top-up financing
contract where the EIB will make available to Aperam an amount of €75 million, in addition to the outstanding
loan of €100 million, in relation to the financing of advanced stainless steel manufacturing technologies. This
top up facility of €75 million was fully drawn on October 8, 2021, at a rate of 0.88%, with a final maturity date
of October 25, 2031.

Schuldscheindarlehen

On September 24, 2019, Aperam successfully priced an inaugural €190 million multi-tranches
Schuldscheindarlehen (debt instrument governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany) with
maturities at 4, 5, 6 and 7 years. On the back of a very positive investor perception and significantly
oversubscribed orderbook, Aperam was able to upsize the deal volume from the initially announced volume of
€100 million to ultimately €190 million. Fixed rate tranches for a total amount of €150 million bear an Interest
rate between 1.10% to 1.50% when floating rate tranches for a total amount of €40 million bear an interest
rate of EURIBOR 6M + 1.10% to 1.50%. The company was able to price all tranches at the tight end of the
announced spread ranges. Aperam took advantage of the very constructive market to secure attractive
conditions and successfully diversify its creditors base.

Commercial paper programme

On July 10, 2018, Aperam received confirmation from Banque de France, as foreseen by art. D.213-2 of
“Code monétaire et financier’ of the French law, that the conditions as described in the financial
documentation of its programme of NEU commercial paper for a maximum outstanding amount of €200
million, fulfil the requirements of law. On December 31, 2022, an amount of €114 million was drawn under the
Aperam NEU CP programme.

True sales of receivables programme

The Company has established sales without recourse of trade accounts receivable programme with financial
institutions, referred to as True Sales of Receivables (“TSR”). The maximum combined amount of the
programmes that could be utilised were €520 million and €370 million as of December 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, respectively. Through the TSR programme, certain operating subsidiaries of Aperam
surrender control, risks and the benefits associated with the accounts receivable sold. Therefore, the amount

39


--- Page 31 ---

Annual Report 2022

of receivables sold is recorded as a sale of financial assets and the balances are removed from the statement
of financial position at the moment of the sale.

On February 11, 2022, Aperam has increased its sales without recourse of trade accounts receivable
programme with financial institutions, referred to as TSR, to a maximum combined amount of the programmes
that could be utilised to €420 million from €370 million earlier.

On April 27, 2022, Aperam has increased its sales without recourse of trade accounts receivable programme
with financial institutions, referred to as TSR, to a maximum combined amount of the programmes that could
be utilised to €520 million from €420 million earlier.

The total amount of receivables sold under the TSR programme and derecognised in accordance with IFRS 9
for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 were €2.8 billion and €2.0 billion, respectively. Expenses
incurred under the TSR programme (reflecting the discount granted to the acquirers of the accounts
receivable) are recognised in the consolidated statement of operations as financing costs and amounted to
€(7) million and €(4) million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Recent developments

On January 26, 2023, Aperam confirmed the extension of the maturity of the sustainably linked senior
unsecured revolving credit facility of €500 million by one year.

Credit ratings

On June 13, 2019, Aperam announced that it has requested to be withdrawn from the credit rating services of
S&P Global Ratings and Moody's Investor Service, while reaffirming to maintain investment grade financial
ratios. Given the Company’s low level of debt at that time and the nature of funding needs, credit rating
services were no longer considered necessary.

On June 27, 2019, Moody's Investors Service withdrew the 'Baa3' long-term issuer rating with stable outlook
of Aperam S.A.

On July 15, 2019, S&P Global Ratings withdrew its 'BBB-' long-term issuer credit rating with stable outlook of
Aperam S.A.

A strong focus on self-help measures

From the very beginning, Aperam has always pursued a strategy designed to reinforce the robustness of our
business using self-help measures. We accomplish this by leveraging our in-house internal improvement
measures continuously and by relying on our own resources. This has proven to be a successful strategy,
one that supports our performance by reducing our reliance on external factors/resources.

As our key strategic priorities have proven their efficiency in terms of operating and financial performance over
the past years, we will remain focused on achieving Phase 4 of the Leadership Journey® through a
combination of cost, growth and mix improvement measures.

The Leadership Journey® is an initiative aimed at achieving management gains, fixed and variable cost
reductions, and increased productivity over the near and medium-term by enhancing the potential of our best
performing assets. The Leadership Journey® is composed of a number of phases that can be broadly
characterised as restructuring and cost cutting projects, upgrading best performing assets, transformation
initiatives, and growth and mix improvements. Each phase is described below.

The completed Leadership Journey® initiatives by phase and total target gains

Phase 1: 2011-2013
Restructuring & cost cutting

Phase 2: 2014-2017
Upgrading best performing assets

Phase 3: 2018-2020
Transforming the Company

Completed

Launched at the early stage of the
programme in 2011, the
restructuring initiatives focused on
the closure of non-competitive
capacities and the reduction of
fixed costs through, in particular,
process simplification and major
cost cutting investments.

Completed

Since the beginning of 2014,
major projects were launched to

help Aperam overcome
bottlenecks in its downstream
operations, improve its cost

competitiveness, and enhance its
product portfolio.

Total gains reached under Phase 1 and Phase 2:
U.S.$573 million

Completed
Launched in 2017, this phase of
the journey aimed to transform the
business and address the next
generation needs of our customers
by creating a modern, _fully-
connected and technology-enabled
organisation. This was extended in
early 2019 to consider cost
reductions, including —_ general
procurement and raw material
savings.
Total gains reached under Phase
3: €223 million

Phase 4 of the Leadership Journey®: Combining growth, mix and cost improvements

On November 4, 2020, Aperam announced Phase 4 of its Leadership Journey® with a cumulative target of
€150 million gains for the period 2021 - 2023 via a combination of cost, growth and mix improvement
measures. This new phase of the Leadership Journey®, comprises two stages. First, changes to our footprint
will defend our cost leadership in Europe by bundling volumes and expertise at the most efficient lines. This
forms a solid basis for stage 2 where the resulting increase in productivity will be used for the mix
improvement and growth pillars. We plan a total cash out of €90 million for Phase 4 which comprises capex
and any associated restructuring costs. As of December 31, 2022, Phase 4 of the Leadership Journey®
reached €122 million of cumulated annualized gains.

Structural cost: Our new rolling lines in Genk - the lowest cost plant in Europe - will play a crucial part under
this Phase and result in efficiency gains and considerable fixed cost reductions. In addition we target
improvements in our SG&A costs as we start transforming us in a post-COVID-19 era.

Growth in Specialties :The footprint concentration and increasing the flexibility of our lines will also enable
us to use specialized lines to further develop high value products. The new set-up is expected to accelerate
our top line strategy. The growth components will to some degree materialize beyond 2023 and yield gains in
addition to those included in the Phase 4 gains.

Our growth initiatives include:

To grow our sales of high margin value added niche products and replace low contribution margin
products, we will continue to focus on developing innovative products through our research and
development initiatives, while also leveraging our marketing and advertising efforts for wider
promotion. This includes accelerating the stainless steel consumption in the Brazilian market.

Our industrial footprint in Europe and South America is perfectly complemented by our global
service centres and sales networks, which are part of our Services & Solutions segment. In a
volatile market environment, we believe that the development of the Services & Solutions segment
and the provision of better customer services are key to achieving financial and operational
excellence. Our value-added services include cutting, polishing, brushing, forming, welding,
pickling, annealing and packaging. We believe that further developing the Services & Solutions
segment will not only drive additional value creation, it will also allow us to serve our customers
more effectively.

The Alloys & Specialties segment focuses on the design, production and transformation of various
specialty alloys and certain specific stainless steels. These products are intended for high-end
applications or to address very specific customer requirements such as for e-mobility, renewable
energies, new display devices (e.g. Oled screens), aerospace, automotive, electronics - to name
only a few. We believe that the Alloys & Specialties segment has significant growth potential,
especially in light of our R&D support and creative solutions we offer our customers. As an example,
Aperam has launched in cooperation with Tekna, a leading actor in metallic powder manufacturing,
a company named ImphyTek Powders to market Nickel and Specialty Alloy spherical powders for
advanced additive manufacturing technologies.

Differentiation: Our recognized Environmental-Social-Governance leadership, strong balance sheet, financial
discipline, and value oriented M&A approach will come as a support to our cost and growth initiatives.

Sustainability and Environment - Our Recycling & Renewables Division

Aperam benefits from the integration of former ELG as Aperam Recycling in our Recycling & Renewables
Division on various levels, including lower costs, environmental improvement and growth. With more than
2,000 of our employees working in Aperam Recycling, the segment defends Aperam’s cost leadership position
with specific synergies identified. It also drives our environmental ambition by facilitating even higher uses of
recycled materials, which lowers further our energy consumption and our Greenhouse Gas emissions.
Aperam Recycling supports our growth potential and opens new areas for development within Aperam by
closing the recycling loops, increasing the scrap volumes and by improving quality of our stainless steel and
our Alloys and Specialties’ superalloys. In Europe, Aperam also now benefits from a secure supply of our key
strategic raw material, as we use more than 80% of scrap in our European operations.

In Brazil, we have a strong link to sustainable agriculture: our production process is 100% based on charcoal
from our own sustainably cultivated eucalyptus forests, which is unique in the world and gives us one of the
best carbon footprints globally. In Brazil, about 1,000 of our employees are employed in seedling, nursing and
planting of eucalyptus trees. Our forest management is based on the best practices, recognized by the Forest
Stewardship Council’s (FSC®) certification, which standards and principles conciliate ecological protection
(flora and fauna, but also water reserves) with social benefits and economic feasibility. As an example of our
responsible forest management, we use the most ecological and advanced technologies to preserve our
forests from diseases and fire. Beyond our environmental responsibility in Brazil, we are very proud to be
recognised since our creation as one of the best companies to work for in the Brazilian steel industry. Thanks
to our own Foundation, in Brazil, we are also very much engaged in the educational, cultural, environmental
and social agendas of the communities where we operate.

Performance - A competitive footprint in Europe and Brazil

Aperam's modern production facilities enable the Company to meet its customers’ needs for stainless and
specialty steel with a high level of operational efficiency.

In Europe, the Group benefits from high-quality and cost-efficient plants, including the largest and most recent
electric arc furnace meltshop (Chatelet, Belgium), the largest hot rolling mill (Chatelet, Belgium), one of the
largest cold rolling mills (Genk, Belgium) and LC2I, the best-in-class integrated rolling-mill (Isbergues,
France). In January 2018, we announced a new investment project of €130 million at our Genk (Belgium)
plant. This consists of adding a new cold rolling and a new annealing and pickling line to further facilitate the
transformation of our business. With these state-of-the-art modern lines, which use the latest technology, we
can enlarge our product range to include the most demanding applications, improve lead-times and our
flexibility to meet market demands, increase the efficiency and cost competitiveness of our assets, and

49


--- Page 41 ---

Annual Repo! 2

continuously enhance our health, safety and environmental impact. In May 2021, we announced the
investment in revamping the hot rolling mill for long products at Imphy and re-start of the Argon Oxygen
Decarburization (AOD) converter project in Genk that was put on hold in 2019. Both projects, together with the
planned specialties centre in Gueugnon, will further contribute to the reorientation of our product portfolio
towards specialties.

To adapt to market conditions, shortly after its creation, Aperam restructured its downstream operations from
29 to 17 tools in Europe. As a result, Aperam has reached an optimal loading of its most efficient assets and is
well positioned in Europe’s core markets. To benefit from the long-term growth potential of the stainless and
specialty steel market and further improve its cost competitiveness in a highly competitive environment,
Aperam aims to continue improving its operational excellence and investing in its industrial asset base with
Leadership Journey® initiatives (described in detail under the section "A strong focus on self-help measures").

In South America, Aperam is the only integrated producer of flat stainless and electrical steel. Our integrated
production facility is based in Timdteo (Brazil), and produces a wide range of stainless, electrical steel and
special carbon products. This production setup is unique, as it allows to switch flexibly between products and
markets to maximise profitability.

Based on low levels of historical and apparent consumption per capita and a developing market for stainless
steel, management foresees a substantial potential for growth in South America. In Brazil, Aperam continues
to benefit from the actions of the Leadership Journey® and Top Line strategy, while the long-term growth
prospects in terms of stainless steel consumption have remained intact.

Value add and proximity to Customer - Our Geography and Our Distribution Network

Aperam's research and development activities are closely aligned with our strategy and focus on product and
process development. The Group's Research and Development team comprises 144 employees (FTE)
spread across two main centres in Europe (Isbergues and Imphy, France) and one main centre in Timdteo,
Brazil. These centres interact closely with the Group's operating segments and partner with industrial end-
users and leading research organisations to remain at the forefront of product development. Our research and
development capabilities have contributed to both the Group's position as an industry leader and its
development of long standing and recognisable brands. Aperam concentrates a significant portion of its
research and development budget on high margin, value-added niche products, such as specialty alloys, and
on developing products with enhanced capabilities for new applications and end markets. As our customers
look to lower their carbon footprint, Aperam is present with a wide range of products answering the strong
demand for more sustainability. Some of our solutions are highlighted below.

The Company is the second largest producer in Europe, and the leading stainless and specialty steel
producer in South America. Aperam is well-positioned in both developed and emerging markets. At the Group
level, approximately 74% of Aperam’s sales are derived from developed markets and 26% from emerging
markets.

Aperam has a strong presence in the European stainless steel market. Not only are the Group's modern
production facilities in Belgium and France strategically located close to scrap generating regions, they are
also close to the Group’s major customers. Aperam’s European industrial operations have consistently
maintained high performance standards through the optimisation of production volumes, inventory and costs.

The Group also has a highly integrated and technically advanced service centre and distribution network that
is effective at maintaining direct contact with end-users through its strong sales and marketing capabilities.

Annual Report 2022

Aperam’s integrated stainless and specialty steel sales, distribution and service networks has a total of 15
Steel Service Centres, 5 transformation facilities and 15 sales offices, and is one of the largest in the world.
This network, along with its best-in-class service, allows the Group to develop customer loyalty and a
consistent and stable customer base, while also capturing additional value in downstream operations. The
Group's distribution channels are strategically located in areas of high demand and close to many end-users.
The Group's global distribution network enables it to tailor its products to address specific customer needs,
thereby facilitating the maintenance of our market share and the capturing of growth opportunities. The
Group's customer base is well diversified, consisting of a number of blue chip clients.

Our Premium Products - Alloys and Stainless Specialties

Aperam offers a wide range of products, including high margin value-added niche products to a diversified
customer base in both emerging and developed markets. It is this diverse product offering, sold to a wide
range of customers across numerous industries, that allows the Group to enjoy greater stability and to
mitigate some of the risks and cyclicity inherent in certain markets.

The Group's products are mainly sold to end-users in the automotive, building and construction, catering and
appliance, energy and chemicals, and transportation industries. Our electrical steel products are primarily sold
to customers in the electric motors, generators and transformers industries. We are the fourth largest global
producer of specialty alloys and the largest producer of alloys wire rods and strips, which are sold to
customers in the aerospace, automotive, electronics, petrochemical, and oil & gas industries. As previously
mentioned, Aperam is also engaged in the Nickel and Specialty Alloy spherical powders for advanced additive
manufacturing and metal injection molding technologies though its JV ImphyTek Powders SAS.

Principal risks and uncertainties related to the
Company and the stainless and specialty
steel industry

The following major factors could cause actual results to materially differ from those
discussed in the forward-looking statements included throughout this Annual Report:

Macro-economic & geopolitical risks indirectly impacting Aperam
Global economic cycle downturn

Aperam’s business and results of operations are substantially affected by international, national and regional
economic conditions, including geopolitical risks that could disrupt the economic activity in affected countries.
A period of slow growth in emerging economies that are, or are expected to become, substantial consumers of
stainless and specialty steels (such as China, Brazil, Russia and India, as well as other emerging Asian
markets and the Middle East) would have a material adverse effect on the stainless and specialty steel
industry.

Overcapacity
In addition to economic conditions, the stainless steel industry is affected by global production capacity and
fluctuations in stainless steel imports and exports. Production capacity in the developing world, particularly

China and Indonesia, has increased substantially, with China being the largest global stainless steel producer.
Accordingly, the balance between China’s domestic production and consumption is an important factor

52


--- Page 44 ---

Annual Report 2022

impacting global stainless steel prices. Stainless steel exports from these countries, or conditions favourable
to them (such as excess capacity in China / Indonesia and/or higher market prices for stainless steel in
markets outside of China/Indonesia) can have a significant impact on stainless steel prices in other markets,
including Europe and South America. Over the short- to medium-term, Aperam is exposed to the risk of
stainless steel production increases in China and other markets (including Indonesia) outstripping increases in
real demand, which may weigh on price recovery in the industry as a whole.

China slowdown

A reduction in China’s economic growth rate, with a resulting reduction in stainless and specialty steel
consumption, coupled with China’s expansion of steel-making capacity, could continue to substantially
weaken both domestic and global stainless and specialty steel demand and pricing.

The risks of nickel price fluctuation, raw material price uncertainty, material margin squeeze,
over dependency of main suppliers and electricity

Aperam’s profitability correlates, amongst other factors, with nickel prices. A significant decrease in the price
of nickel would have a negative impact on apparent demand and base prices due to “wait and see” behaviour
by customers. Furthermore, nickel is listed on the LME and thus subject to the fluctuation of the financial
markets. Stainless and specialty steel production requires substantial amounts of raw materials (primarily
nickel, chromium, molybdenum, stainless and carbon steel scrap, charcoal (biomass) and iron ore), which can
lead to an over-dependence on its main suppliers. Aperam is also exposed to price uncertainty and material
margin squeeze with respect to each of these raw materials, which it mainly purchases under short- and long-
term contracts, but also on the spot market.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates

Aperam operates and sells its products globally, and a substantial portion of its assets, liabilities, costs, sales
and income are denominated in currencies other than the Euro (Aperam’s reporting currency). Accordingly,
currency fluctuations triggered by inflationary movements or other factors, especially the fluctuation of the
value of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real, as well as fluctuations in the currencies of
the other countries in which Aperam has significant operations and/or sales, could have a material impact on
its results of operations.

Litigation risks (product liability, patent infringement, commercial practices, employment,
employment benefits, taxes, environmental issues, health & safety)

A number of lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been and may be asserted against Aperam in relation to
he conduct of its currently and formerly owned businesses, including those pertaining to product liability,
patent infringement, commercial practices, employment, employee benefits, taxes, environmental aspects,
health and safety, and occupational disease. In particular, Aperam is subject to a broad range of
environmental laws and regulations in each of the jurisdiction in which it operates. Such laws and regulations
focus in particular on air emissions, wastewater storage, treatment and discharges, the use and handling of
hazardous or toxic substances, slag treatment, soil pollution, waste disposal practices and the remediation of
environmental contamination.

Due to the uncertainties of litigation, no assurance can be given that the Company will prevail on all claims
made against it in the lawsuits that it currently faces or that additional claims will not be made against it in the
uture. While the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some of these lawsuits, claims
or proceedings may have an outcome that is adverse to Aperam, Management does not believe that the
disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on Aperam’s financial

condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could
have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations for that period.

Risks of lack of competitiveness of the workforce costs, of losing key competencies and
inability of attracting new key competencies, and social conflicts

A lack of competitiveness in workforce costs might have a material adverse effect on Aperam’s cost position.
Aperam’s key personnel have extensive knowledge on its business and, more generally, on the stainless and
specialty steel sector as a whole. Its inability to retain key personnel and/or the experience of social conflicts
could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Customer risks in respect to default and credit insurance companies refusing to insure the
risks

Due to the challenging economic climate, Aperam might experience increased exposure to customer defaults
or situations where credit insurance companies refuse to insure the recoverability risks of its receivables.
Such a scenario could have a material effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

Cybersecurity risks

Aperam’s operations depend on the secure and reliable performance of its digital systems. An increasing
number of companies, including Aperam, are experiencing phishing attacks and other intrusion attempts for
ransom money transfers, as well as attempts at compromising the digital systems operation. If such attempts
would succeed, they could cause applications unavailability, data compromising, adverse publicity and, in the
case of a successful attack to our production systems, interruptions to the Group’s operations. Aperam could
be subject to litigation, civil or criminal penalties, and adverse publicity - all of which could adversely affect its
reputation, financial condition and results of operations.

Risk of production equipment breakdown, delays in investments ramp-ups, risk of disruption
of operations and supply chain, and lack of energy availability

Stainless steel manufacturing processes are dependent on critical steelmaking equipment, such as furnaces,
continuous casters, rolling mills and electrical equipment (such as transformers).The production process may
incur downtime as a result of unanticipated failures or other events, such as fires, severe climate events,
explosions or furnace breakdowns, shortage in gas supply in Europe.

Aperam’s manufacturing plants have experienced, and may in the future experience, plant shutdowns or
periods of reduced production, disruption of operations and supply chain as a result of such process failures,
or other events such as natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics, extreme weather events, and environmental
issues linked to climate change. Efficient project management is crucial to mitigate the risk of delays in
investment ramp-ups to sustain Aperam future growth.

Climate-related Disclosures

As a key player in the field of a high-carbon emission sector, Aperam is fully aware of the challenges, risks
and opportunities in relation to Climate change and the transition to a lower-carbon economy, in particular with
respect to our financial implications.

Aperam has an ambitious climate change action plan with solid greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets
as well as general sustainable practices, including water stewardship, recycling and relevant monitoring. In
our action plan, impacts on Aperam’s local stakeholders is a key performance indicator. Aperam fully
integrates into its strategy the need for a more circular economy, as demonstrated with the creation of our new

segment Recycling & Renewables and the acquisition of the former ELG (a major player in the global
stainless scrap recycling market) in December 2021.

We are aware of the mid- to long-term impacts expected from the energy transition, which is why we started to
use an internal price of carbon for the assessment of our investments as early as 2016. This allowed Aperam
to manage the possible repercussions in terms of emission trading system, price of commodities, access to
credit, competition and market trends amongst others.

Aperam is convinced that climate change, and the transition to a more sustainable economy, will open new
opportunities for our responsibly-manufactured products.

All these aspects are reported in full in our annual Group Sustainability Report as well as considered as part
of the assumptions made in terms of financial impacts incorporated into our Annual Report’s consolidated
financial statements, specifically with regard to assets in scope of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment or
IAS 38 Intangible Assets and to impairment of non-financial assets under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. No
related material impairments are to be reported to this respect for the 2022 Financial Statements.
