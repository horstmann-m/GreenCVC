2015 IN THE SPOTLIGHT

Dear Shareholders,

The 2015 results reflect the success of Novabase’s
ocus on internationalization, and are in line with
our strategic goals.

Our international business increased 22%, surpassing

€100 million. Operations in Europe expanded 44%,
and now accounts for more than half of non-domestic
business, now with a new subsidiary in the United
ingdom. International business now represents 46%

or the first time, in the current consolidation perimeter,

of the total, above the annual goal of 40-45%.

This was only possible through the winning of major
new contracts in several regions, which bears out

the global competitiveness of our offerings.

Services also held their upward trend, driven by

the noteworthy international performance of Business
Solutions, which increased 51%.


--- Page 2 ---

06 2015 IN THE SPOTLIGHT

EBITDA fell within the tolerances of guidance,

and includes repositioning costs from the adverse
setting of the emerging markets where we do

business, with relevant impacts on Infrastructures &
anaged Services. Net Profits were very strong in their
performance, benefiting from the favourable financial
results. Over the course of the year, €4 million in cash
was generated. Based on these results, we will propose
a dividend of €0.12 per share at the next General
eeting of Shareholders.

We improved our already high levels of customer
satisfaction, achieving a Net Promoter Score of 45,

he highest of all time. We strengthened our
investments in human capital by hiring 105 more young

university graduates, along with multiple training
initiatives. We also continued our talent development
program through Leadership and Coaching
Enhancement initiatives.

n the field of innovation, as just one example, we

saw the launch of the MyWizzio solution at Finovate
Fall 2015 in New York. The Finovate conferences
showcase the biggest and latest fintech innovations,
with high-quality networking, attracting more than
,000 technology and finance companies from across
he globe at each event. In the area of Venture Capital,
FCR Novabase Capital Inovacao e Internacionalizacao
sold part of its investment in the company Feedzai in
a venture capital investment round led by Oak HC/FT,



--- Page 3 ---

one of the world’s leading venture capital companies

in the area of fintech. Feedzai is involved in data
science, and is a benchmark in innovation in Novabase
Capital’s portfolio. Novabase was also invited to join
the recently-created Euronext Tech 40 index of leading
European companies in innovation.

We continued our social responsibility initiatives in the
area of education, including sponsorship of the FST/
Novabase project with students from IST, together
with summer courses in partnership with the Carlucci
American International School of Lisbon and the Sintra
City Council.

2015 IN THE SPOTLIGHT

We will keep internationalization a priority in 2016,
ailoring our focus to the risks of the world’s current
macroeconomic backdrop. We will limit our exposure
oO emerging markets, in view of the volatility of some
economies where we do business.

Finally we would like to thank all of Novabase’s
employees for their talent and tremendous dedication,
and all of our customers, partners and shareholders for
he confidence they have placed in us.

CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE

Novabase has been a publicly traded company since
July 2000. It operates according to a corporate
governance model which is regularly assessed by the
Board of Directors with regard to its adequacy and
performance, with a view to optimizing the latter in
close alignment with the interests of all stakeholders
- those interested in its corporate activities - namely
shareholders, investors, customers, suppliers, other
business partners and employees.

In view of the mounting challenges of
internationalization and competitiveness which have
characterized Novabase’s business, the company’s
corporate governance system needed to be updated,
namely by simplifying and streamlining structures and
procedures, to better adapt existing solutions to the
company’s specific size and circumstances.


--- Page 7 ---

In its General Meeting of Shareholders dated 29 April
2015, Novabase amended its articles of association and
implemented a reinforced Latin corporate governance
model including a Board of Directors, Supervisory
Board and Statutory Auditor (ROC). Under this model,
a substantially more agile day-to-day management
structure has been implemented, including two
managing directors (Luis Paulo Cardoso Salvado (CEO)
and Francisco Paulo Figueiredo Morais Antunes (CFO).
Moreover, Novabase has a general meeting board
elected for three-year terms of office, along with

a Remuneration Committee appointed by the General

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 11

Meeting of Shareholders to establish the remuneration
of each corporate board member based on the duties
performed and the company’s financial status.

The company also designates a secretary and
respective substitute, under the terms of article 446-A
of the Commercial Companies Code, to perform the
duties established by law.

In order to improve its governance practices whenever
possible and tailor the model to the company’s
demands and challenges, Novabase constantly
analyzes its implementation.

BUSINESS SUMMARY

The 2015 results reflect the success of the defined
strategy, confirming the trends that have been
anticipated over the year.

Indeed, there has been clear progress in terms of
internationalization and differentiation of the offerings,
with a significant increase in international activity that
represents now 46% of the total, above the annual
goal of 40-45%, and with the growth in services, which
accounts for approximately 3/4 of the total business.

Compared to the same period of last year, Turnover
increased by 5%, due to the significant 22% growth

in the international business, and EBITDA rose 2%,

an operating improvement that reflects the measures
implemented in late 2014 (restructuring aiming to
improve competitiveness in the domestic operations
and freeing resources to the effort

of internationalization). Towards the Guidance,

the results of 2015 were above on Turnover, and
within the EBITDA range.

To highlight that Novabase won several managed
services contracts for the European Commission.
These contracts, led by Novabase, are included in
the framework agreement signed in consortium with
another European company.

In the last quarter, and following the strategic priority
of enhancement of internationalization, the company
Celfocus Ltd, in UK, was incorporated, which will allow
ovabase to expand its operations in Europe.

With regard to new partnerships, Novabase IMS is
since the beginning of 2015, Gold partner of EMC, the
Storage and Backup market leader in Portugal. In the
second quarter, Novabase and OutSystems signed

a strategic partnership to offer new joint products
and services in the markets where they do business.
Likewise, Novabase and SAP strengthened their
partnership, to resell SAP products and solutions in
Africa. Note that Novabase has been a recognized
SAP partner for more than 15 years, and received
certification as a SAP Channel Partner in 2013.

In terms of innovation, Novabase launched MyWizzio in
New York, at Finovate Fall 2015. Finovate conferences
showcase the latest and the greatest in global fintech
and perform high quality networking, gathering over
1000 fintech innovators and financial institutions from

34 FINANCIAL AND STOCK PERFORMANCE

RISKS

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial
risks, namely, Foreign exchange risk, Cash flow and fair
value interest rate risk, Credit risk, Liquidity risk and
Capital management risk.

The Group’s overall risk management program focuses
on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks
to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s
financial performance.

A) FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to
foreign exchange risk, mainly arising from U.S. Dollar,
Kwanza and Metical exposure, since some subsidiaries
perform transactions in these currencies.

The finance department is responsible for the tracking
of the exchange rate of the currencies mentioned
above, in order to reduce the impact of the fluctuation
in consolidated results. The Group uses derivative
financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.


--- Page 31 ---

B) CASH FLOW AND FAIR VALUE INTEREST
RATE RISK

The Group’s interest-rate risk arises from finance
investments in banks and bonds, and borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group
to cash flow interest-rate risk. Borrowings issued

at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest
rate risk.

FINANCIAL AND STOCK PERFORMANCE

C) CREDIT RISK

Credit risk is managed, simultaneously, on business
unit levels, for the amounts of outstanding trade and
other receivables, and on Group basis, for financial
instruments. Credit risk arises from cash and cash
equivalents, derivative financial instruments, as well

as credit exposures to wholesale and retail customers,

including outstanding receivables and committed
transactions. For banks and financial institutions, only
independently well rated parties are accepted. Credit
risk management of trade and other receivables is
based in credit limits, taking into account the financial
position of the customer and past experience.

35


--- Page 32 ---

36 FINANCIAL AND STOCK PERFORMANCE

D) LIQUIDITY RISK

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining
sufficient cash and marketable securities,

the availability of funding through an adequate amount
of committed credit facilities and the ability to close
out market positions.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s
liquidity reserve (which comprises undrawn committed
borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents)

on the basis of expected cash flows, taking into
account the analysis of the remaining contractual
maturity of the financial liabilities and the expected
date of financial assets inflows, and taking into
account the cash transfer restrictions from Angola
and Mozambique. Additionally, a regular monitoring

is made to the maturity concentration of borrowings
of the Group.

E) CAPITAL MANAGEMENT RISK

The Group’s objectives when managing capital, which
is a broader concept than ‘equity’ in the consolidated
statement of financial position, are:

(lI) To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as
a going concern in order to provide returns for
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders;

(Il) To maintain a solid capital structure to support the
development of its business;

CII) To maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce
the cost of capital.

OUTLOOK FOR 2016

The results of 2015 reflect the successful
implementation of Novabase’ strategic options in
internationalization and differentiation of its offerings.
Turnover increased, strongly driven by the international
business, which now accounts for 46% of total business.
Likewise, the weight of services increased to 73%.

Novabase has defined as a priority for 2016 the
continuity of the strategic focus on internationalization,
adjusting the focus on the risks of the current global
macroeconomic situation. Therefore, Novabase will limit
its exposure to emerging markets, given the volatility in
some of the economies where it operates.

In terms of Guidance, it is expected a Turnover of 215
M€, more than 45% of which outside Portugal, and an
EBITDA between 14 M€ and 17 M€.
