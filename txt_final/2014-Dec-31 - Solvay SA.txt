Financial & extra-financial information

MANAGEMENT REPORT

The management report for the accounting period ending on December 31,
2014, consisting of pages 47 to 74 (Corporate governance) and 75 to 85
(Management of risks), has been prepared in accordance with Articles 96
and 119 of the Belgian Companies’ Code and was approved by the Board of
Directors on February 25, 2015. It covers both the consolidated accounts
of the Solvay group and the statutory accounts of Solvay SA.

In this section, Solvay is presenting its 2013 and 2014 comparative Income
statements. Therefore, 2013 income statement has been restated for:

= Eco Services business, which was sold on December 1, 2014. Since
the 3° quarter of 2014 Solvay restated its 2013 and 2014 income
statement and statement of cash flows to reflect the discontinuation
of the business;

= The retrospective application of IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements on
January 1, 2014,

MANAGEMENT REPORT

The term “restated” throughout this document must be understood as
per above considerations, unless otherwise stated.

The European and Latin-American Chlorovinyls business activities
are presented as “Assets held for sale” on the statement of financial
position (in one single line) and as “discontinued operations” in the
income statement.

The intended sale of Solvay’s 70.59% majority stake in Solvay Indupa
to Braskem has been rejected by the Brazilian competition authority
(CADE) in November 2014. Solvay confirms that its strategic direction
remains unaffected and that it is examining alternative options to
sell its participation in Solvay Indupa. As a disposal within 12 months
is considered highly probable, Solvay Indupa remains classified as
“Assets held for sale” on the statement of financial position and as
“discontinued operations” in the income statement.

Chemlogics is consolidated in the financial statements from November 1,
2013.

Management analysis convention

Business performance and analysis

In addition to the consolidated IFRS accounts for 2013 (historical and
restated) and 2014 provided in pages 128 to 209 (Financial statements)
in this report, Solvay is disclosing “Adjusted” Profit & Loss information
and analysis in order to provide a more meaningful presentation of
the economic and financial performance of the Group and its business
segments between periods.

Adjusted Profit & Loss indicators referring to 2013 and 2014 exclude non-
cash Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) accounting impacts related to the
Rhodia acquisition.

All references to year on year evolution must be understood comparable,
and on an adjusted basis for 2013 and 2014, unless otherwise stated

The term “Net sales” refers to the sales of goods and value-added
services corresponding to Solvay’s know-how and core business. Net
sales exclude other revenues primarily comprising commodity and utility
trading transactions and other revenues deemed as incidental for the
Group (for example temporary).

Furthermore, for its analysis and financial communications, Solvay uses

non-GAAP" indicators, the definitions of which are the following

REBITDA which consists of EBIT as presented in the income
statement, excluding:

= recurring amortization and depreciation;
= non-recurring items;

= material financing related costs and non-recurring items for
companies consolidated using the equity method of accounting;

= operating revenues/expenses not taken into account by
management when assessing segment performances;

non-recurring items mainly include:

m= gains and losses on the sale of subsidiaries, joint operations,
joint ventures, and associates that do not qualify as discontinued
operations;

acquisition costs of new businesses;

gains and losses on the sale of real estate not directly linked to
an operating activity;

major restructuring charges;

impairment losses resulting from the shutdown of an activity or
a plant;

impairment losses resulting from testing CGUs for impairment
(a CGU includes tangible assets, intangible assets and allocated
goodwill, if any);

the impact of significant litigation;

the remediation costs not generated by on-going production
facilities (shut-down of sites, discontinued activities, previous
years pollution);

Free Cash Flow is calculated as cash flow from operating activities
(including dividends from associates and joint ventures) + cash
flow from investing activities (excluding acquisitions and sales of
subsidiaries and other investments and excluding loans to associates
and non-consolidated subsidiaries);

net debt is defined as short and long-term financial debt less cash
and cash equivalents and other current receivables - Financial
instruments.

Solvay believes that these measurements are useful tools for analysing
and explaining changes and trends in its historical results of operations,

as they allow performance to be compared on a consistent basis. However,
they are not subject to audit and are not performance measurements
with respect to IFRS. The methods of calculating changes used by Solvay
may differ from those used by other companies.

(1) Generally accepted accounting principles.

Financial & extra-financial information

MANAGEMENT REPORT

Commercial and administrative costs

Commercial and administrative costs of € (1,225) million in 2014 rose by
€ (36) million or by 3% compared to prior year. This increase is primarily
due to the inflation experienced over the different regions where the
Group operates. The impact of Chemlogics' acquisition is partly offset by
favorable foreign exchange rate effects.

Research and innovation costs

Research and innovation costs amounted to € (247) million in 2014,
increasing by 4% compared to prior year thanks to reinforced research
efforts of the business units. The ratio of research and innovation cost
on net sales remained stable at 2.3%.

Other operating gains and losses
Other operating gains and losses in 2014 amounted to € 16 million on an
adjusted basis, compared to € 59 million in 2013. In 2013, the realignment

of insurance policies of the Group had led to the reversal of provisions for
positive € 22 million. The rest of the variance is essentially due to an
unfavourable net balance of exceptional items.

On an IFRS basis, other operating gains and losses amounted to
€ (94) million, or a € (110) million difference with the adjusted accounts
and corresponding to the depreciation of PPA on fixed assets relative to
Rhodia's acquisition. Please refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial
statements.

Earnings from associates and joint ventures accounted for
using the equity method

Earnings from associates and joint ventures accounted for using the
equity method amounted to € (34) million compared with € 34 million
in 2013. The decrease of € 67 million is largely driven by an exchange loss
on euro debt due to rubble devaluation, reducing RusVinyl joint venture
Net Equity.

* Restated for comparable purposes.

REBITDA grew 11% to € 1,783 million from € 1,611 million in 2013, with
organic volumes up 9% or € 139 million. Unfavorable foreign exchange
rates for the year and the phase-out of CER carbon credits weighed
€ (73) million. External growth, mostly Chemlogics, contributed 5% or
€ 85 million

The wide range of excellence measures spanning from manufacturing
to innovation, marketing and sales strengthened operating performance
and offset the inflation in our fixed cost base.

In a deflationary raw material context, the Group was able to maintain
price increases and reported a positive pricing power. Selling prices
increased € 44 million year on year and raw material prices declined
€ (38) million, resulting in a € 82 million positive net price effect on
REBITDA to which excellence initiatives on variable costs and value
pricing contributed.

All Operating Segments contributed to Solvay’s REBITDA increase.
Innovation-driven demand bolstered volumes and profit at the Group’s
growth engines Advanced Formulations and Advanced Materials.
Performance Chemicals and Functional Polymers delivered strong cost
reductions with operational excellence programs.

The Group’s REBITDA margin on net sales widened SO basis points to
17.5% from 16.6% in 2013, a substantial improvement when considering
€ (15) million forex impact and the CER credit phase-out between the
two years.

Depreciation and amortization charges

In 2014, depreciation and amortization charges amounted to € (641) million
on an adjusted basis versus € (614) million in 2013. This increase is mainly
linked to the acquisition of Chemlogics

Depreciation and amortization charges in 2014 IFRS accounts amounted
to € (751) million or a € (110) million difference with the adjusted accounts
and corresponding to the depreciation of PPA on fixed assets relative to
Rhodia’s acquisition.

Non-recurring Items

Non-recurring Items of € (308) million (€ (239) million in 2013) included
restructuring expenses of € (49) million versus € (115) million in 2013,
as well as other costs primarily linked to environmental, litigation and
portfolio management provisions for a combined € (99) million compared
to € (59) million in the prior year. It also included non-cash impairment
charges of € (160) million chiefly relating to Solvay's investment in
the RusVinyl joint venture and to a lesser extent relative to Emerging
Biochemicals epichlorhydrine plant in China.

Operating result

EBIT, on an adjusted basis, grew 4% to € 761 million from € 734 million in
2013. Besides amortization and depreciation charges of € (641) million, it
included overall financial charges of € (65) million related to the RusVinyl
project financing, including impacts from the 60% appreciation of the
euro against the ruble since the end of 2013 on debt expressed in euros.

EBIT on an IFRS basis totaled € 652 million. The difference between
IFRS and adjusted figures reflects the Rhodia non-cash PPA depreciation
impact of € (110) million.

In 2014, net sales at Advanced Formulations grew 17% to € 2,854 million
from € 2,432 million last year. Chemlogics contributed 13%, while organic
volume growth was 6%, and prices increased 1%. Forex headwinds had
an adverse impact of (2)%.

In 2014, REBITDA grew 23% to € 426 million, supported by organic and
external volume growth. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates led to a
decline of € (8) million.

Solvay - Annual Report 2014

At Novecare, growth was driven by the oil & gas activities. The successful
and swift integration of Chemlogics strongly contributed to this good
dynamic.

Coatis was impacted by Brazilian economy which suffered from weak
competitiveness and imports and persistent drought in the country.

Aroma Performance benefited from good growth in demand for vanillin
and in pricing power in inhibitors, but industrial issues throughout the
first part of the year reduced its performance.

Net sales of Advanced Materials increased 8.3% to € 2,762 million
in 2014 from € 2,551 million in 2013. Growth was supported by strong
volumes +10% in most end markets and especially in auto and smart
devices. Positive volume impacts were partially held back by lower raw-
material led prices (1) % mainly at Rare Earth Systems, as well as by
unfavorable foreign exchange rates (1) %.

REBITDA for Advanced Materials reached a record, up 14% at
€ 709 million underpinned by robust innovation-driven demand, despite
significant forex headwinds mainly Japanese yen of € (38) million, chiefly
of a transaction nature.

The excellent Operating Segment’s REBITDA reflected the performance
of its four businesses. Beyond volume dynamics, excellence programs
in manufacturing, purchasing and commercial activities also supported
this performance.

* Restated for comparable purposes.

Net sales of Performance Chemicals grew 1.4% to € 2,944 million.
Price increases of 3% compensated for the adverse foreign exchange
developments which lowered the segment's sales by (2)%. Volumes
stood stable.

REBITDA for Performance Chemicals grew 6.1% to € 724 million supported
by good pricing. The Operating Segment’s good performance was backed
by all four businesses, despite unfavorable currency developments,
chiefly at Acetow and Emerging Biochemicals.

Soda Ash & Derivatives delivered solid performance. Price increases
across all regions and its breakthrough competitive program could make
up for inflation. The targeted € 100 million annual cost savings plan is
well on track to be achieved by the end of 2015.

Peroxides’ volume growth benefited from higher H,0, demand in mature
markets as well as developments of new applications.

Acetow showed a record performance in 2014 driven by higher prices and
despite the destocking impact on volume during the second half of the
year.

Emerging Biochemicals was flat, reflecting weak demand in PVC and
epichlorohydrin as well as pricing pressure from competition

Following unfavorable conditions specific to the Chinese market, the
Group decided to put on hold the construction of a production asset
in China and booked an impairment of € (34) million (reported as non-
recurring item below REBITDA).

Note: The sale of the Eco Services business to CCMP CAPITAL was completed on
December 1, 2014 (consolidated as discontinued business).

* Restated for comparable purposes.

Functional Polymers reported net sales of € 1,654 million in 2014
compared to € 1,763 million last year. The sale of the Benvic PVC
compounding business represented a decline of (5)% or € (89) million.
Furthermore, volume growth of 2% was insufficient to compensate for
a decline in prices of (2)% and unfavorable foreign exchange rates taking
off (1)%.

REBITDA increased 25% to € 111 million from € 89 million in 2013.
The operating performance was supported by both the delivery of the
profit restoration plan and solid performance at Engineering Plastics
which grew its volumes in Asia and showed strong pricing power. Fibras
suffered from Brazil's weak macro-economic conditions.

Discontinued Operations: Solvay’s European Chlorovinyls businesses,
planned to become part of the Inovyn joint venture with INEOS, as well
as Solvay Indupa, are classified as Discontinued Operations.

The sale of Benvic to OpenGate Capital was completed in June 2014.

The remaining Chlorovinyls businesses refer to the residual trading
activities not included in the INEOS joint venture agreement.

The market environment declined in 2014, impacting the performance of
the European Chlorovinyls business. Net sales amounted to € 2.4 billion
and REBITDA came in at € 111 million for the combined European and
Latin American business.

REBITDA (188) (131) (43)%

* Restated for comparable purposes,

Net sales were nil compared to € 67 million last year. The last carbon
credit (CER) sales under the 2013 Kyoto protocol were phased out entirely
in the first half of that year.

Net costs at REBITDA level amounted to € (188) million compared to
€ (131) million in 2013. The end of CER sales impacted Energy Services
contribution by € (58) million and this loss was partially compensated for
by the energy and carbon management services in Europe.

Expenses related to corporate structure and corporate functions increased
to € (213) million from (185) million last year. The difference mainly came
from the favorable € 22 million one-off reversal of provisions linked to
the realignment of the Group’s insurance policies booked last year.

Furthermore, tight cost controls compensated for inflationary elements
while the Group continued investing in the deployment of best-in-class
business support services.

MANAGEMENT REPORT

Energy situation

Energy costs are an important part of the Group's cost structure. Net
energy costs represented about € 0.9 billion in 2014. Energy sources were
spread over electricity and gas (circa 75%), coke, coal and anthracite (circa
20%) and steam and others (circa 5%). The Solvay group has pursued an
active energy policy for many years now. In this context, it operates an
energy production park with a total installed capacity of 1,000 MW.

Within the Group, Solvay Energy Services focuses on optimizing the
Solvay’s energy costs and carbon emissions. Furthermore, Solvay Energy
Services has continued deploying its operating energy efficiency
excellence initiative called SOLWATT®, which aims at reducing energy
consumption and optimizing energy production on industrial sites.
SOLWATT® also defines the medium and long term energy strategy
for each site. It is gradually rolled out and will cover all the Group’s
manufacturing sites by the end of 2015. The objective is to reduce by
10% the Group energy bill.

Net financial expenses increased to € (309) million from € (213) million
in 2013. Charges on net debt diminished to € (145) million from
€ (166) million in 2013 as the repayment of € 1.3 billion of gross debt in
the first half of 2014 helped to significantly lower the Group’s negative
cost of carry. Net financial expenses also contained a € (19) million
negative one-off due to the settlement of interest rate swaps in the first
half of the year.

The cost of discounting provisions for environmental and pension
liabilities widened to € (163) million from € (87) million in 2013. This was
mainly related to environmental provisions which in 2014 included an
overall € (35) million negative one-off impact following applicable lower
discount rates across geographies, whereas in 2013, increases in discount
rates resulted in a positive impact of € 36 million. Income from “available
for sale investments” was nil in 2014 compared with € 40 million in 2013.

Income taxes on an adjusted basis narrowed to € (120) million from
€ (209) million in 2013. The nominal tax rate was 24.6% and included
the recognition of an exceptional € 110 million deferred tax assets. The
underlying tax rate was 32.8%, in line with the Group’s expectations.

Net result from discontinued operations was € (244) million
against € 110 million in 2013, and related mainly to the pre-minorities
impairment loss of € (477) million of the European Chlorovinyls assets
to be contributed to the joint venture project Inovyn. The € 177 million
capital gain from the sale of Eco Services partly compensated for the
impairment loss.

Net income on an adjusted basis fell to € 89 million from € 422 million
in 2013. Net income Group Share, on an adjusted basis, came in at
€ 156 million profit. Adjusted basic earnings per share amounted to
€1.87.

Net income Group Share on an IFRS basis amounted to € 80 million.

Excluding exceptional items, net income Solvay share amounted to
€ 635 million, versus € 507 million m in 2013.
