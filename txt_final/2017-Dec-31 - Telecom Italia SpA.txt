Financial highlights

In terms of economic and financial performance in 2017:

™" Consolidated revenues amounted to 20 billion euros, up by 4.2% on 2016 (+2.7% in organic terms). The
figure for the fourth quarter of 2017 showed growth of 1.2% (+2.8% in organic terms).

=" EBITDA amounted to 7.8 billion euros, down by 2.6% on 2016 (-3.7% in organic terms). The organic EBITDA
margin came to 39.3%, 2.6 percentage points lower than in 2016. EBITDA in 2017 was pulled down by non-
recurring expenses for a total of 883 million euros (198 million euros in 2016 at constant exchange rates),
without which the organic change in EBITDA would have been +4.6% (+382 million euros), with an EBITDA
margin of 43.7%, up by 0.7 percentage points compared to 2016.

™ EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 amounted to 1.6 billion euros (2.1 billion euros in 2016). In organic
terms, and without the impact of the above-mentioned non-recurring expenses, the change would have
been an increase of +4.1%.

"  EBIT amounted to 3.3 billion euros, down by 11.6% compared to 2016 (-12.1% in organic terms), as a result
of the negative impact of non-recurring net expenses of 913 million euros (185 million euros in 2016 at
constant exchange rates), without which the organic change in EBIT would have been +6.9%.

= EBIT for the fourth quarter of 2017 amounted to 457 million euros (954 million euros in the fourth quarter
of 2016). In organic terms and without non-recurring net expenses, the change from the fourth quarter of
2016 would have been +12.5%.

= Profit for the year attributable to Owners of the Parent amounted to 1.1 billion euros (1.8 billion euros in
2016). On a like-for-like basis i.e. without including the impact of non-recurring net expenses and, in 2016,
the positive impact of the fair value measurement of the embedded option in the mandatory convertible
bond converted into TIM shares profit for 2017 would have been approximately 270 million euros higher
than the figure for 2016.

= Capital expenditures for 2017 amounted to 5,701 million euros (4,876 million euros in 2016) and included
the outlay of 630 million euros for the renewal of the user rights to the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz (GSM)
frequencies by the Domestic Business Unit. In the Domestic Business Unit, the innovation component of
total network investments rose to 63% (+6.3 percentage points compared to 2016) thanks to the selective
approach taken to investments, which focused on identifying projects delivering higher returns and
targeted at raising levels of UBB coverage through innovation or transformation.

=" Adjusted net financial debt amounted to 25,308 million euros at December 31, 2017, up by 189 million
euros compared December 31, 2016 (25,119 million euros). The positive performance of business operations
almost entirely absorbed the cash requirements relating to income taxes, which were much higher than in
2016, the outlay of 630 million euros for the renewal, as reported earleir, of user rights to domestic mobile
telephone frequencies, and the payment of 257 million euros by the Brazil Business Unit to the consortium
for the clean-up of the 700 MHz spectrum, for which the business unit purchased user rights in 2014.

Statements.
The materiality matrix for 2017, which summarizes the point of view of the Company and the stakeholders,
also identifies the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to which the Group believes it can make an
appreciable contribution through the digitalization of the Country, social inclusion and the protection of human
rights, improving the sustainability of the value chain and combating climate change.

(1) The average exchange rates used for the translation into euro (expressed in terms of units of local currency per 1 euro) were 1.12946 in 2017
and 1.10666 in 2016 for the US dollar. For the Brazilian real, the average exchange rates used were 3.60584 in 2017 and 3.85935 in 2016. The
effect of the change in exchange rates is calculated by applying the foreign currency translation rates used for the current period to the period
under comparison.

(2) The change in the scope of consolidation has been calculated by excluding the contribution of the companies that have exited from the
comparison figure and adding in the estimated contribution of any companies entering the scope of consolidation.

® an increase of 16 million euros in the component outside Italy of employee benefits expenses; the
lower cost of labor connected with the drop in the average salaried workforce outside Italy (-1,392
average employees) was offset by both local wage growth and the exchange rate effect, referring
essentially to the Brazil Business Unit, which resulted in around 24 million euros of higher costs. In the
previous year, the Brazil Business Unit had recognized a total of 16 million euros (at constant exchange
rates) in non-recurring expenses relating to the implementation of the company restructuring plan.

activities. The drop was driven by lower provision charges and lower contribution fees for telecommunications

operations.

In detail:

™ revenues from services in the Fixed-line market remained largely stable compared to 2016 at 9,952 million
euros (-0.1%), but showed major recovery and improvement in the fourth quarter of 2017 (+1.2% compared
to the same period of 2016). The natural decline in revenues from traditional voice services (-279 million
euros), due to falling traditional accesses and the cut in regulated prices for certain wholesale services (-72
million euros), was more than offset by higher revenues from ICT solutions (+56 million euros, +9%) and,
above all, by higher revenues from innovative data connectivity services (+284 million euros, +15%), driven by
growth in the Ultra-Broadband customer base (+1.2 million on 2016), which reached a total of 2.1 million
customers (3.1 million including wholesale lines).

™ revenues from Mobile services came to 4,655 million euros, an increase of 75 million euros compared to the
previous year (+1.6%). Growth was driven by the positive competitive performance, which led to growth in
the customer base without diluting ARPU levels. Growth in the previous three quarters was confirmed in the
fourth quarter (+0.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016), despite the impact of new roaming rules in
the European Union.

Revenues from product sales, including the change in work in progress, amounted to 1,354 million euros in 2017
(+226 million euros compared to 2016) and reflected growth in sales of smartphones and other connected
devices (smart TVs, Smart Home products, modems, set-top boxes, etc.).

EBITDA

EBITDA for the Domestic Business Unit totaled 6,171 million euros in 2017, down by 527 million euros compared
to 2016 (-7.9%), with an EBITDA margin of 40.2% (-4.4 percentage points compared to the previous year). The
figure for 2017 was brought down by non-recurring expenses totaling 882 million euros (182 million euros in the
previous year), relating to the corporate restructuring and reorganization expenses reported earlier, as well as
disputes and business transactions, which peaked in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Without those expenses, the organic change in EBITDA would have posted growth of 2.5%, with an EBITDA
margin of 45.9%, in line with the 2016 figure, despite the higher share of revenues from products, which have
lower margins than revenues from services.

EBITDA was boosted by the positive performance in sales, and hence in revenues, as well as by the cost
optimization plan, which lowered industrial and general operating costs without reducing support for sales
drives.

° Mobile revenues posted positive growth compared to 2016 (+1.2%), driven by steady improvement in the
services segment (+4.5% in the fourth quarter). In particular, growth in new digital services (+13% on the
previous year) more than offset the continuing decline in traditional services (-9% in 2016, mainly in

relation to voice services);

°  Fixed-line revenues rose by 111 million euros (+3.2% on 2016), driven mainly by the equipment and
product segment. Revenues from services remained substantially in line with the 2016 figure, as lower
prices and revenues from traditional services (connected with the technological shift towards VoIP
systems) were offset by steady growth in revenues from ICT services (+9.3%).

™ Wholesale: revenues for the Wholesale segment in 2017 came to 1,690 million euros, down by 90 million
euros compared to 2016 (-5.1%). Negative growth was due to the absence of non-recurring income from the
sale of infrastructure (cable ducts and dark fiber/Backbone) to other operators, which had a positive impact
on revenues for 2016. Nevertheless, growth in revenues from access and ultra-broadband services in 2017
(+88 million euros) more than offset the cut in regulated prices (-72 million euros).

than offset the drop in revenues from IP/Data/Other services, which were affected by the non-renewal of long-
term contracts that expired in May 2017 (-33.7 million euros); net of the expired contracts, the IP/Data/Other
component would have posted organic growth of 4.0 million euros.

Revenues

Revenues for 2017, amounting to 16,234 million reais, were up by 617 million reais (+4.0%) on the previous year.
Revenues from services totaled 15,474 million reais, an increase of 754 million reais compared to 14,720 million

reais for 2016 (+5.1%).

Mobile Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) for 2017 was 20.2 reais, up on the figure of 18.0 reais for 2016
(+12.2%), due to the general repositioning towards the postpaid segment and new commercial initiatives
aimed at increasing data usage and the average spend per customer.

The total number of lines at December 31, 2017 was 58,634 million, representing a decrease of 4,784 thousand
compared to December 31, 2016 (63,418 thousand). The decline was entirely attributable to the prepaid

segment (-7,701 thousand) and was only partially offset by growth in the postpaid segment (+2,918 thousand),
also as a result of the consolidation underway in the market for second SIM cards. Postpaid customers
represented 30.4% of the customer base at December 31, 2017, up 6.9 percentage points on December 2016
(23.5%).

Revenues from product sales came to 760 million reais (897 million reais for 2016; -15.3%). The decline
reflected a change in the sales policy, which is now focused more on value than on increasing sales volumes.
The main goals of the new strategy are to increase purchases of new connected devices giving TIM customers
access to broadband services on 3G/4G networks and to support new loyalty offerings for higher-value
postpaid customers.

EBITDA amounted to 5,894 million reais, up by 780 million reais on 2016 (+15.3%). The growth in EBITDA was
attributable to both the positive performance of revenues and the benefits delivered by projects to enhance
the efficiency of the operating expenses structure, launched in the second half of the previous year.

The EBITDA margin stood at 36.3%, 3.6 percentage points higher than in 2016.

As reported, employee benefits expenses for 2016 included non-recurring expenses for termination benefits of
56 million reais. Excluding the impact of the non-recurring expenses, EBITDA for 2017 showed growth of

EBIT

EBIT amounted to 1,931 million reais, up by 513 million reais (+36.2%) on 2016 (1,418 million reais). This result
benefited from the greater contribution from EBITDA (+780 million reais), which was offset by higher
depreciation (+228 million reais) relating to the development of industrial infrastructure, and a lower impact of
net gains from disposals of assets (-39 million reais), mainly attributable to the sale of telecommunication
towers. In this regard, we note that the last partial sale of telecommunications towers to American Tower do
Brasil took place in the second quarter of 2017. This transaction resulted in proceeds and an income effect of
an immaterial amount. EBIT for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled 729 million reais (586 million reais for the

Consumer

Growth in the Fixed-line Consumer market continued to be driven in 2017 by the convergent and quadruple
play offers of TIM SMART, a TIM family deal that combines Internet access, fixed-line phone service, mobile
service and on-demand TIMVISION content all in one, and by continuing innovation in commercial deals, with
promotional formulas reproposed in 2017 offering particularly competitive prices, including:

= local promotions: in Milan, for instance, starting from 19.90 euros for 1 year, and then 29.90 euros until the
fourth year; and in other select cities starting from 24.90 euros for 4 years;

™ TIM SMART welcome promo: a 10 euro discount for 3 renewals in April and May, and a promotional deal
>e “- ©& > © -—  »»- To. »-- -- ce jlGe - ...7» °

To help drive the adoption of fiber, TIM continued to give customers reached by the fiber-optic network a free
trial of the new superfast fiber-optic services.

Building on the high service standards of its offers, in 2017 TIM introduced major improvements to customer
experience for new TIM fixed-line customers, with the launch in April of new next-generation delivery services
which:

™ enable customers to make service appointments on their own by SMS;
™ extend appointment times and days for TIM technical service calls, which can now be made Saturdays.

In 2017, TIM confirmed its commitment to the constant technological development of its network by
accelerating deployment of fiber-optic connections, retaining its leadership for best fiber-optic coverage in
Italy with over 2,000 municipalities served at the end of 2017 and the release in June of new ultrafast
connections, running at 200Mbit/s over FTTCab and at 1000Mbit/s over FTTH.

Business strategy in the Mobile market in 2017 focused strongly on a direct debit campaign in an effort to
reduce churn rates and stabilize customer spending. As part of the campaign, a range of deals was launched
TIM Special, TIM Young, TIM 60+, TIM International) offering content benefits and subscription discounts for
customers choosing to direct debit the subscription fee from their bank account or credit card. In June 2017,
the TIM direct debit campaign was given a further boost with the launch of TIM Ricarica Automatica, a new
option for customers to top-up their credit automatically the day before a deal is renewed or when their credit
falls below 3 euros. Other initiatives to reduce the churn rate involved the launch of special deals, in March
2017, offering a discount on activation fees for customers, providing their TIM Card remains activated for 24
months. If not, the discount applied will be reversed and charged. In addition, in an effort to differentiate itself
from its competitors, TIM introduced new features to its portfolio of mobile deals that build on the competitive
advantages of the quality of its 4G and 4.5G networks, with new offers launched to maximize customer
retention (such as exclusive smartphone deals for customers of more than one year) and exclusive PREMIUM
content unlocked for all customers, including TIM Show, featuring the best TIMMUSIC playlists, Gameloft
games and STUDIO+ TV series. The introduction of distinctive offers like these underpins a “value” strategy
and a focus on the quality of our deals that have allowed us to maintain our premium positioning on the
market.
At the same time, efforts continued to focus on the spread of new smartphones through the offer of premium
content and unique formulas, such as the “NEXT” smartphone renewal deal. TIM was the first to offer this kind
of deal, allowing the customer to replace their smart phone every year at no cost, with extra services such as
protection against damage and theft.
The customer retention drive in 2017 once again included a wide-ranging program of commercial initiatives
> ~ ce f 7 from. 7 ~ > eo ~ ee eE 1 - ~ { -
Halloween, etc.), to show our care for customers and boost brand loyalty and satisfaction levels.
Lastly, during the year the company also continued its segment-based approach, with dedicated value
propositions according to the varying needs of the targets. In particular, for Young customers, initiatives
included targeted music deals and special content offers for customers choosing to direct debit subscription
charges from their bank account or credit card. For the youngest customers (Young Junior), TIM focused on
expanding the content it offers to appeal both to younger children (TIM Games) and parents (TIM Protect, to
control Internet browsing, and tracking services and devices). Finally, for Senior customers, the company
expanded its offering with targeted features such as dedicated 24/7 telephone assistance and simplified
smartphones.

The year 2017 also saw significant progress in the technological evolution of the TIM mobile network. At
national level, 4G LTE technology has now reached more than 7,100 municipalities, covering over 97% of the
population. Moreover, TIM has also confirmed its technological leadership through the development of its 4G
Voce service (VoLTE technology), which allows all customers with a compatible smartphone to experience
the quality of high-definition (HD) voice calls. The company continued the steady roll- 1 ce
cities of 4.5G services (LTE Advanced technology), which offer data connection speeds of up to 700 Megabits
per second. In July, TIM gave a world preview of the exceptional download speeds of up to 1 Gigabit per

Business

TIM's work in the Business market during 2017 focused on four main areas:

™ restoring positive growth in the Fixed-line and Mobile customer bases, in line with trends in the various
segments (fixed-line, mobile and IT) and turning around the decline in revenues;

™ consolidating the customer retention process through structural initiatives targeting both the proposal of
deals and customer experience;

™ streamlining and simplifying internal processes through their progressive digitization, to further improve
the flexibility and effectiveness of our approach to the market;

™ extending -o- er CA Lj = »thé- —» -e- ~“f- >>
>- eo _ wee fe = eH... =  @the- ve > »loug consputing solutions for
SMEs.

Initiatives were directed towards the commercial front end, accelerating the progressive enhancement of the
assets that make TIM an integrated operator: fixed-mobile convergence, innovation driven by significant
investment and IT which, in support of the core business, helps the traditional offering to stand out. At the
same time, additional investments were targeted at further expanding the reach of our widespread and
dominant direct and indirect commercial networks, which are a key asset for our business. The primary
objective pursued over the year was to defend the customer base (by stemming line losses in the fixed-line
segment and achieving net growth in Mobile users) and to strengthen TIG c 7 ~ . ~ -
in steering the IT needs of small and medium enterprises, corporates and the public sector. Major ‘efforts were
also focused on boosting ARPU through bundle propositions combining different types of services, and by
leveraging professional services that are distinctive and highly visible. This stronger commercial presence also
helped to drive greater use of core connectivity services, speeding up the spread of fixed-line fiber and VoIP
services and the adoption of LTE/VoLTE on the mobile network, thanks to significant increases in the
coverage of both during the course of the year. The M2M customer base was expanded greatly, which,
together with technological innovation towards 5G networks, will lay the groundwork for the development of
new next-generation services (loT).
In the Fixed-line market, in particular for the SOHO-SME segment, TIM radically simplified its entire portfolio of
deals by rationalizing and steering it closer to changing market demands, with the focus squarely placed on
fiber-optic and VoIP solutions. Most notably, a dual-line fiber-optic solution was launched to enable the
migration of ISDN customers. To support ARPU growth and boost customer retention, the range of offers was
enriched with bundle deals for Unified Communication services (Nuvola IT Comunicazione Integrata Smart)
and IT services, delivering major opportunities for end users in terms of efficiency and new business
development. In all segments, the emphasis was on differentiating TIM to stand out in terms of its range of
deals, the professionalism of its services and their exclusivity, to ensure the identification as a Premium player
(also supported, for the first time, with dedicated radio and television campaigns).
For high-end Business customers, the portfolio of offers for professional connectivity services was overhauled
to privilege fiber-optic connectivity deals. The proposition of cloud computing services was stepped up with
new offers launched for VoIP and advanced Collaboration w@- ~f-c _ > f 7 » ton> fo >
—- "@- >= ...@7>—-cloud deal, offering SIP trunking as part of the Nuvola IT Comunicazione
Integrata offer. This type of strategy will help promote the development of IT services.
Information Technology offers underpinned major growth in revenues for the segment as a whole and in
revenues from cloud services. Developments in services were focused primarily on leveraging Data Center
assets and on the offer of Security, Communication as a Service and Business Solutions. Efforts were stepped
up with respect to 2016 to promote the adoption of SPC Cloud Lotto 1 solutions for the Public Sector, in
particular cloud-based laaS, PaaS, SaaS solutions. To drive the more widespread adoption of cloud services by
Local Public Sector bodies, cloud-based SPC solution packages were developed offering data protection, server
virtualization, website management/development and statutory document archiving. Development of the OTT
IT offering also continued. The Digital Store Market Place now features around 100 solutions for SMEs, of which
around 70 were developed by partners in the TIM Open environment, using both horizontal and vertical
approaches for new e-commerce, e-payment, security, and video control solutions, to give just a few
examples.
In terms of Mobile services, the Business market in 2017 also saw further development of the Mobile Ultra-
Broadband service over the LTE and VoLTE networks, while also expanding our offering with VAS and IT
solutions.Growth was posted over the year in the total acquisition of lines and the churn rate improved. The
overall performance of MNP was also positive and solid growth was witnessed in the M2M segment. Data and

improve retention rates.

For our top-end customers, alongside contract renegotiations with large customers to defend revenues, the
Tutto Smart offering continued, which provides a bundle of services for smartphones and tablets while also
adding a suite of extra services to our standard All-Risk Assistance priced at a monthly fee per line. Business
with this particular segment improved in terms of effectiveness, thanks to the greater efficiency of
processes/systems and bidding initiatives.

Finally, in 2017, Olivetti, now integrated into the Business Unit in organizational terms, focused on the
optimization of its traditional Enterprise Services and Specialist Assistance business, and on expanding its
foothold in innovative areas such as Metering & Tracking, Connected Cars, Smart Retail, Digital Schools,
Business Intelligence (through the TIM Visual Insight and Tim City Forecast offers), Smart Agriculture and
ndustry 4.0.

n 2017, TIM Brazil fully renewed its range of offers to reposition the brand with high-value customers,
everaging its leadership in the 4G network.

The change in approach had a major impact on the mix of the customer base, mainly in the prepaid segment,
resulting in the progressive and marked migration of customers from single service daily plans (voice and/or
data) to recurring weekly/monthly plans that bundle voice and data packages with other value-added services
music, e-reading and video streaming), all with a view to stabilizing future revenue flows and proactively
managing the consolidation underway of the market for second SIMs. The main sales initiatives included:

™ the launch of a new range of recurring bundle offers (TIM Pre) for the Prepaid segment, which offer
comprehensive and differentiated solutions for voice and data services;

™ the introduction of TIM’s innovative “More for More” approach for the Controle segment, which gives
customers more value in terms of calls, data and unlimited content. The approach has underpinned
constant growth in the customer base as increasing numbers of prepaid customers migrate to higher value
recurring offers, which has positively impacted growth in ARPU generated;

™ the launch of new offers for the Postpaid Consumer segment including the TIM Black brand, consisting of
differentiated data offers bundled with add-on packages to access specific content (Netflix, Cartoon

™ the overhaul of the customer acquisition strategy for the Postpaid Corporate SMB segment, where TIM
is the market leader. The new strategy does away with trade-ins as a sales practice, to ensure the growth
and retention of the high-value customer base and avoid arbitrage by sales channels;

™ greater commercial development of the brand TIM Live in the Residential Fixed-line Broadband segment,
which posted strong growth in the customer base thanks to service levels that are among the highest on
the market. The launch of FTTH offers is planned for the first half of 2018. In addition, in a select number
of smaller cities without fixed-line UBB networks, WTTX was launched to provide mobile access to limited
broadband services, building on the potential of the 700 Mhz 4G network.

In the same Resolution 623/15/CONS, AGCom asked TIM to submit two alternative proposals (unbundling and
outsourcing models) regarding greater autonomy for the other licensed operators in the provision of delivery
and assurance for the local loop unbundling (LLU) and sub-loop unbundling (SLU). On August 23, 2017, by
Resolution 321/17/CONS, AGCom approved an unbundling model that gives other licensed operators the
possibility of choosing between TIM and external companies, selected by TIM, for provisioning and assurance
services, while still fully meeting the requirements of integrity, functional operation and security of the
network.

Infratel Tenders for the subsidizing of the Ultra Broadband networks
In March 2017, Infratel Italia awarded the company Open Fiber (OF) the five lots of the tender for the
construction and operation of networks enabling the offering of Ultra Broadband services (from 30 to 100

28-day invoicing

On March 24, 2017, by Resolution 121/17/CONS, AGCom ordered all TLC providers to set their invoicing cycles on
a monthly or multiple month basis for fixed-line and convergent (fixed-line and mobile bundles) services, with
the deadline for compliance set at June 23, 2017. Resolution 121 marks the definitive conclusion of a regulatory
dispute whose sole purpose has always been to ensure price transparency and the comparability of economic
terms and conditions.

TIM has filed an appeal against the decision with the Lazio Regional Administrative Court on the grounds that
AGCom is not vested with such power given that neither European nor national legislation contemplate limits
on the invoicing cycles chosen by fixed-line and mobile service providers. ASSTEL (the association of TLC
providers) has also appealed the decision on behalf of the sector as a whole. A ruling is expected between
March and April 2018.

On the basis of the Resolution, in September 2017, AGCom initiated penalty proceedings against TIM and other
TLC operators, which ended with the handing down of Resolution 499/17/CONS in December 2017, under which
TIM (and other TLC operators) was fined 1.16 million euros and ordered to refund, when restoring the monthly
(or multiple month) invoicing cycle, additional amounts charged for the corresponding number of days of
service not utilized by customers, from June 23, 2017 onwards, resulting from to the realignment of the 28-day
invoicing cycle to a monthly cycle. At the end of January 2018, TIM filed an appeal with the Regional
Administrative Court against the decision, requesting its suspension.

In December 2017, the Italian parliament approved Law 172/17 introducing mandatory monthly invoicing for all
electronic communication services, with the deadline for compliance set at April 5, 2018.&

On February 12, 2018, the Lazio Regional Administrative Court rejected the appeal of TIM (and similar appeals
filed by Wind Tre, Fastweb, Assotelecomunicazioni, Eolo and Postemobile) against Resolution AGCom
121/17/CONS. TIM will challenge the ruling with the 8*",!C(!*& /!& H#’#*Instead, the Lazio Regional

customers amounts corresponding to the number of days of service not utilized, from June 23, 2017 onwards,
under the 28-day invoicing cycle. The merits hearing has been set for November 14, 2018. On March 7, 2018,
TIM was notified of the decision by AGCOM (Resolution 112/2018/CONS) to (i) order the Company, in relation to
fixed-line telephone services only, to postpone the commencement of invoices issued after the restoral of the
monthly invoicing cycle by a number of days equal to those presumed gnawed since June 23, 2017 under the
28-day invoicing cycle; and (ii) cancel part of its previous Resolution 499/17/CONS in which TIM was ordered to
refund amounts presumed gnawed since June 23, 2017 under the 28-day invoicing cycle. The decision will be
appealed by TIM with the Lazio Regional Administrative Court.

Finally, we report that on February 19, 2018, AGCM initiated proceeding 1820 to investigate alleged collusion
among major operators in an agreement to restrict competition in complying with the provisions laid down by
Law 172/17.

Universal Service
By Resolution 46/17/CONS of January 26, 2017, AGCom introduced new measures regarding the subsidized
financial conditions for access to fixed-line and mobile services for particular categories of disabled customers.
The provisions of the measure, which apply to the deaf and the totally and partially blind, broaden the current
subsidies, both in terms of discounted services (e.g. flat voice and data offers) and categories of disabled
people covered (e.g. the partially blind). In February 2017, TIM submitted an appeal to the Lazio Regional
Administrative Court against Resolution 456/16/CONS of October 2016, through which AGCom rejected TIM's

those annual periods and appointed an independent consultant to revise the calculation of the USO, by
Resolution 145/17/CONS for the years 2006 and 2007 and by Resolution 207/17/CONS for the years 2004 and
2005. Audit activities were started in October 2017 and should end by mid-2018.

Wholesale mobile network markets

International roaming

On June 15, 2017, the provision of European Regulation 2015/2120 of November 25, 2015 ("Telecom Single
Market - TSM Regulation") entered into force, which requires for the application of the national tariff for intra-
EU voice, SMS and roaming data traffic.

On April 25, 2017, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a regulation establishing new wholesale
caps for roaming traffic valid from June 15, 2017 to June 30, 2022 (Voice: 3.2 euro cents per minute; SMS 1 euro
cents per SMS, data: 7.7 euro/GByte in 2017; 6 euro/GByte in 2018; 4.5 euro/GByte in 2019; 3.5 euro/GByte in
2020; 3 euro/GByte in 2021; and 2.5 euro/GByte in 2022).

AGCom contribution fee

On March 31, 2017, TIM paid an amount of 19.3 million euros, with reservation, for the 2017 AGCom
contribution fee. The value was calculated by applying the rate of 0.0014 to the revenues recorded in the
Company's 2015 Financial Statements. The guidelines for the calculation of the contribution fee, set out in the
AGCom Resolutions 463/16/CONS and 62/17/CONS, have not changed with respect to those established for the
calculation of the 2016 contribution fee.

Antitrust

Case A500B

On December 13, 2017, AGCM concluded proceeding A500B, finding that the Company, with the assistance of
Telecom Italia Sparkle S.p.A., had abused its dominant market position by forcing an equally efficient
downstream competitor that purchases SMS termination for the mobile network to reduce its margins.

AGCM imposed an administrative fine on TIM of 3.7 million euros. TIM lodged an appeal against the decision
with the Regional Administrative Court on February 26, 2018.

Case “1799”
On February 1, 2017, AGCM initiated investigation proceedings for possible breaches of Article 101 TFEU (ban on
competition-restricting agreements) against TIM S.p.A. and Fastweb S.p.A., following the signing of an
agreement aimed at establishing a joint cooperative enterprise Flash Fiber S.r.l.. In agreement with Fastweb,
TIM has submitted several amendments to the agreements signed to the AGCM, in the form of proposed
commitments, aimed at settling the proceedings without accepting the violation and, therefore, without any
financial penalty. On December 20, 2017, AGCM decided to extend the deadline for the evaluation of the
proposed commitment to February 28, 2018, and the deadline for the conclusion of the proceedings to July 31,
2018. If the commitments undertaken by TIM are approved, AGCM will announce its decision after hearing the
mandatory opinions of AGCom and the European Commission. If instead the commitments are rejected, the
proceedings will continue and be concluded by July 31, 2018.

Case “A514”
On June 28, 2017, AGCM initiated proceedings against TIM for alleged competition breaches of Article 102 of
the TFEU, following complaints made by Infratel, Enel, Open Fiber, Vodafone and Wind-Tre. The charges
against TIM include behavior aimed at: (i) hindering Infratel tender processes in an effort to delay or render less
profitable the entry of another operator on the wholesale market; and (ii) locking in ultra-broadband
customers in advance, to reduce the market space available to competitors. On February 14, 2018, AGCM
decided to extend the scope of the proceeding to investigate other alleged behavior by TIM concerning its
wholesale price strategy for broadband and ultra-broadband wholesale access services and the use of
privileged information concerning the customers of alternative operators. The proceeding is due to end by
October 31, 2018.

Case “1820”

On February 19, 2018, AGCM initiated a preliminary proceeding against the companies TIM, Vodafone, Fastweb
and Wind Tre and the industry association ASSTEL to investigate the alleged existence of an agreement
among the major fixed-line and mobile telephone operators to restrict competition by coordinating their
respective commercial strategies, in breach of Article 101 of the TFUE.

According to the AGCM decision initiating the procedure, collusion is alleged to have consisted of coordination
by the operators in their compliance with the obligation introduced by Article 19-quinquiesdecies of Italian
Decree Law 148/2017 (converted into Law 172/2017) for providers of electronic communication services to
invoice and renew fixed-line and mobile services on a monthly (or multiple month) basis. The proceeding is due
to end by March 31, 2019.

Disputes with AGCom

On October 12, by Resolutions 149/17/CIR, 151/17/CIR, 152/17/CIR, and 150/17/CIR, and on October 30, by
Resolution 153/17/CIR, AGCom concluded 5 disputes brought by TIM against Fastweb to obtain full payment for
a series of services billed to the provider (WLR ISDN PRA, ATM ABR band for VP Bitstream, TDM
interconnection flows, ULL and Bitstream termination, and activation of symmetric accesses), ruling in favor of
TIM.

Potential use of frequencies for mobile technology

Under Decision (EU) 2017/899 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 17, 2017, all frequencies in
the 700 MHz band (694-790 MHz frequencies, corresponding to television channels 49-60 on the UHF band),
are to be allocated on a primary basis to mobile broadband services by 2020, or by 2022 if justified reasons
exist. In Italy, Article 1 (1026 1045) of Law 205 of December 27, 2017 sets out how the 700 MHz band, together
with the 3.6 3.8 GHz and 26.5 27.5 GHz bands, is to be released and auctioned. The 700 MHz band will be
available to mobile service providers as of July 1, 2022, after its release by television broadcasters. The
auctioning of the band is expected to raise at least 2.5 billion euros in revenues for the State, of which 1.25
billion euros in 2018 alone (payment of user rights to 700 MHz frequencies will be spread over 2018 to 2022).

On September 30, 2017, TIM paid up approximately 630 million euros for the renewal of its licenses to the 900
and 1800 MHz bands until December 31, 2029. AGCom has approved the renewal of the licenses and the
Ministerial Decree assigning the extensions is now pending.

As concerns the television frequencies, the 2018 Budget Law provides for the re-farming of lower frequencies
or their return for an indemnity. Specifically, for television broadcasters holding frequency rights to specific
frequencies that are transformed into shared MUX capacity rights, the law envisages an indemnity to
compensate for the technological change of:

™ approx. 277 million euros in total for national broadcasters (including Persidera, holder of national
frequency rights on 5 MUX), equal to an average 7 million euros per channel;

™ approx. 304 million euros in total for local broadcasters, equal to an average 7.6 million euros per channel.

Revision of the model for the provision of telecommunications services

In April 2016, the working group composed of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and

industry and proposed guidelines for the revision of the Brazilian regulatory model. A bill (PLC 79/2016) was
then presented to the National Congress of Brazil to propose amendments to the General
Telecommunications Law. Although the bill was passed by both chambers of Congress, the opposition
challenged the legislative procedure followed in the Supreme Court, where the bill remained blocked for
months. At the beginning of October, the bill PLC 79/2016 was referred back to the Senate, where it is expected

to be debated again over the course of 2018.

In October and November 2017, the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC)
held a public consultation to review the general telecommunications policy, which is expected to lead to the
issue and publication of a new Presidential Decree in 2018. The public consultation process proposed the
setting of guidelines and objectives for the provision of telecommunications services, for the technological

In relation to the deadlines for the upgrading of pipelines not compliant with current regulations,
authorizations for user licenses to radio frequencies, and the introduction of other statutory provisions
generally, planned investments (as identified by Anatel and approved by the MCTIC) will focus primarily on the
expansion of mobile and fixed-line broadband networks and on specific areas of the country. TLC networks
built under the investment plan will have shared access.

Revision of Competition Rules

In November 2012, the Brazilian regulator Anatel introduced instruments for the market analysis, the
identification of operators with significant market power (SMP) and the consequent imposition of $K#"#$
obligations (Plano Geral de Metas de Competicdo PGMC).

Currently, TIM has SMP in (i) passive infrastructure (towers); (ii) mobile network termination, and (iii) national
roaming. A public consultation on reforms to the PGMC was begun on December 7, 2016 and concluded on
March 22, 2017. Alongside the re-identification of relevant markets, work is underway for the classification of
towns on the basis of specific competition levels (1: competitive, 2: moderately competitive, 3: not very
competitive, 4: uncompetitive) before any asymmetric regulatory measures are applied. Under the regulatory
agenda, the new regulation is expected to be introduced in 2018.

700 MHz and Analog TV switch off

In September 2014, TIM won the tender for the award of the 700 MHz (4G/LTE) band frequencies, for a price of
1.7 billion reais, and with additional commitments of 1.2 billion reais (in four annual installments, adjusted for
~ >» ~ ce f “¥ ‘_ f e ~ -e ¥ “e’-> ¥ ~- = >= »
Algar, Claro and Vivo) awarded the contract for managing the freeing up of the 700 MHz band through the
switch off of analog TV, the redistribution of channels and the clean-up of interference. To that end, the first
payment (370 million reais) was made in April 2015 and another two payments (for a total of 860 million reais)
were both made in January 2017, whereas the final installment (142 million reais) is due in January 2018.

Since the switch-off process was launched, 3,592 municipalities have released the 700 Mhz spectrum, including
major cities such as Rio de Janeiro and Sdo Paulo. The municipalities represent 51.7% of the Brazilian
population (105.6 million people) and 89% of national territory.

The market

The Italian TLC market witnessed a turnaround in 2017, posting low but positive growth levels after years of
uninterrupted decline, despite high competition levels in the sector.

The expansion of broadband and ultra-broadband has been the main driver of market growth, helping to open
up new opportunities for telecommunications providers to develop convergent offers that bundle together TLC
services with Media & Entertainment services, IT services and Digital services.

sector _ still the factor that has the greatest impact on market trends ¥ ce ce > ~ sO S ~
by Over-the-Top service providers (OTTs) and device manufacturers, which operate entirely in the digital world,
using completely different assets and competitive strategies to TLC players.

The traditional business models of the various market players are, therefore, changing to exploit new
opportunities and meet the challenges posed by the new entrants:

™ in the Media & Entertainment segment, as the web takes on growing importance as a complementary
distribution platform, OTTs, telecommunications providers and consumer electronics manufacturers are
acquiring an increasingly major role;

= in the Information Technology market, the decline in traditional revenues is driving the various players
towards cloud computing, with the goal of protecting their core business. Telecommunications providers
are strengthening in this sector, including through partnerships;

™ Consumer Electronics manufacturers are developing services that can be accessed through the Internet by
leveraging handset ownership and user experience management, breaking the relationship between
customers and TLC providers;

™  OTTs have, for some time now, been leading the transformation in how TLC services are used (including
voice services), increasingly integrating them with Media & Entertainment, IT and new Digital services.

With regard to the current positioning of telecommunications providers in converging markets, on the
other hand, as partially described above, the following is taking place with different levels of progress:

™ development of new Media & Entertainment services (TV, Music, Gaming) and new Digital services (Smart
Home, Digital Advertising, Mobile Payment-Digital Identity);

™ development of Innovative Services in the IT market, particularly Cloud services.

Competition in Fixed-line Telecommunications

The fixed-line telecommunications market has continued to see a decline in access and voice revenues, while
broadband and ultra-broadband revenues have shown continuous growth. In recent years, service providers
have concentrated mainly on expanding the penetration of broadband and ultra-broadband services and
defending Voice revenues by introducing bundled voice, broadband and service deals in a highly competitive
environment with consequent pricing pressure.
Deals and offers are also becoming more competitive thanks to the consolidation, among competitors, of an
approach based on control over infrastructure (above all, Local Loop Unbundling (LLU), as well as Fiber to the
Cabinet (FTTC) networks). The main fixed-line service providers are also offering mobile services, also as Mobile
Virtual Operators (MVOs).
As concerns competition in infrastructure, two providers Open Fiber (an ENEL Group company) and Infratel
(controlled by the Ministry of Economic Development) presented plans for the development of their own
optic fiber networks as alternatives to the TIM network, which respectively target major Italian cities and areas
of market failure.

For major cities, Open Fiber announced a plan to invest 3.9 billion euros in the development of Fiber to the
Home (FTTH) in 271 large Italian towns by 2022, reaching around 9.6 million real estate units.

™ The service is already available in some districts of major cities, such as Milan, Turin and Bologna, where
Metroweb (which was acquired in December 2016) had previously expanded its network, but also in other
cities such as Bari, Cagliari, Catania, Naples, Padua, Perugia, Venice, Genoa, Palermo and others.

™ Open Fiber announced that it would be extending the network to another 40 towns by the end of 2017,
with another 40 to be added in 2018.

Report on Operations of the Competition | 43
TIM Group
In the meantime, according to media reports, a number of our competitors in the TLC retail market have
signed an agreement with Open Fiber to link their new ultra-broadband customers onto its network, where
available.

As concerns areas of market failure theso-f -» °*~ - -@ _ > f e@w-e-> & ..

Ultra-Broadband Plan __ Infratel held two public calls for tenders over 2016 and 2017 for the development of a
UBB network to deliver services to a total of 9.3 million real estate units in over 6,000 municipalities across 16
regions.

™ In the first call for tenders, Open Fiber won all five of the lots offered in the six regions involved (Lombardy,
Emilia Romagna, Veneto, Tuscany, Abruzzo and Molise), covering around 3,000 municipalities and 4.6
million real estate units.

™ In the second call for tenders, Open Fiber won all six of the lots offered in the ten regions involved
Piedmont, Valle d'Aosta, Liguria, Friuli Venezia Giulia, the Autonomous Province of Trento, Marche,
Umbria, Lazio, Campania, Basilicata and Sicily), covering around 3,700 municipalities and 4.7 million real
estate units.

= Infratel is now preparing a third call for tenders for the remaining areas in Calabria, Apulia and Sardinia
the public consultation process was brought to a close on November 20, 2017).

ce co f° O — dév¥eloprrent plan and the coverage of the public contracts awarded by Infratel stepped
up competition in the infrastructure sector in a major way, by introducing new ultra-broadband networks that
overlap and have a different reach to existing infrastructure:

— areas with two FTTH networks overlapping FTTC networks
— areas with a single FTTH network overlapping FTTC networks
= areas with FTTH networks overlapping ADSL networks

— areas with FTTC networks overlapping ADSL networks

Competition in the Italian fixed-line telecommunications market is also characterized by the presence of other
service providers besides TIM, such as Wind-Infostrada, Fastweb, Vodafone, and Tiscali, which have business
models focused on different segments of the market.

After years of market decline, driven by the migration of fixed-line customers to mobile services and
alternative telecommunications solutions (Voice over IP, e-mail, Social Media chat services), fixed-line accesses
grew slightly in 2017, reaching approximately 20.6 million at December 31, 2017 (including Infrastructured OLO
accesses and FWA-Fixed Wireless Access). Competition in the access market led to a gradual reduction in
TIM's market share.
As concerns the Broadband market, at December 31, 2017, the number of fixed-line broadband customers in
Italy (including both broadband and ultra-broadband customers) was estimated to have reached a penetration
rate of approximately 80% of all fixed-line accesses. The spread of broadband continues to be driven by the
penetration of computers and other enabling devices (such as Smart TVs), but also by growing demand for
fast connections and access to new over-IP services that are becoming increasingly widespread (Media &
Entertainment, IT and Digital services).

Competition in Mobile Telecommunications

The mobile market has continued to see the rationalization of second and third SIM cards for human
communications, while sales of SIM cards for machine to machine (M2M) communications are growing.

The spend on services showed slight growth in 2017, although signs of weakness appeared in the second half
of the year. Revenues from traditional service components, such as voice and messaging services, continued to
decline, while mobile broadband revenues grew strongly.

Growth in mobile broadband customers has continued thanks to the high penetration rate of LTE on mobile
lines, especially as a result of the increasing spread of smartphones.

Alongside innovative services that have already caught on and are under full-scale development, as in the
case of mobile apps, there are other market environments, associated with the development of mobile
broadband, with major potential for growth in the medium term, such as the Internet of Things and mobile
payment.

The competitive scenario in the Italian telecommunications market in 2017 was shaped by the merger of Wind
and H3G, which became effective during the year, creating the biggest single player on the market in terms of
SIM card numbers. During the year, TIM launched Kena Mobile, a new virtual operator on the market. In 2018,
the French provider Iliad is expected to enter the Italian market, where it will become the fourth infrastructured
operator alongside TIM, Vodafone and, now, Wind-Tre.

At the same time, mobile virtual operators (MVO), of which PosteMobile is the most important player, have
continued to enjoy significant growth, taking market share away from infrastructured operators.

Macroeconomic trends witnessed in the last quarter of 2017 confirm the recovery expected in 2018 and should
ensure the sustainability of an expansive economic cycle. Production output has recovered and unemployment
has fallen, while inflation returned to a more contained level (around 4%), after the instability seen over the
last two years, which risked seriously undermining the purchasing power of households.

Nevertheless, the present political uncertainty raises an important question mark over the ability for growth to
be constant and structural, as do the tax rises introduced to rein in the growing budget deficits of
municipalities, Federal States and the central government. At the start of 2018, in fact, an additional tax was
introduced for value-added services, which may complicate the ability of companies to implement business
growth strategies and cost control plans.

n this conflicting setting, the mobile telecommunications sector has seen rationality prevail in the market and
in competition, with service providers remaining focused on the development of the characteristics and service
range of their commercial offers, rather than pursuing aggressive pricing policies.

nthe Prepaid segment, the main objective of market players has been to raise recurrence rates on the use of
services by leveraging the consolidation underway in the market for second SIMs and encouraging migration to
weekly and monthly rate plans or hybrid plans (Controle postpaid) by offering a range of bundled service
packages to meet the different needs of customers (unlimited call minutes or data packages). The aim of the
strategy is to improve the mix of the customer base and ensure greater stability and growth in ARPU.

n the Postpaid mobile segment, growth in the customer base was driven primarily by the migration of Prepaid

sales policy that is bringing greater price stability and effectively repositioning the customer base towards

higher value deals (voice + data + content).

Service quality is increasingly becoming an element of differentiation. The TLC providers that have invested
most in the development of 4G networks and in the improvement of processes shaping customer experience
will have a greater ability than their competitors to apply a premium on prices, as customers raise their
expectations and place growing importance on the quality of data services and higher value content.

The residential fixed-line broadband market posted growth of approximately 7% in 2017 compared to 2016,
driven mainly by smaller market players, which tend to offer faster download speeds and/or service in areas in
which the incumbents have limited infrastructure. Penetration rates across the population are still quite low
when compared to the United States or Europe, which means there are good opportunities for medium-term
growth, underpinned by the improving macroeconomic situation.

In this context, in 2017, TIM adopted a new business strategy based on a differentiated approach between the
big cities, where it has the fiber network infrastructure to offer FTTC/FTTH through TIM Live, and small cities,
where it has leveraged the availability of the 700 MHz 4G network to launch a new WTIX service offering
limited access to broadband. At end of 2017, TIM Live had a customer base of 392 thousand users, up by 28%
on the end of 2016. Its download speeds and customer satisfaction rates rank it among the top broadband
providers in the country.
