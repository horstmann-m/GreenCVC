MANAGEMENT BOARD

MANAGEMENT REPORT

TO THE COMBINED GENERAL MEETING OF
13 MAY 2020” APPROVED AS OF 2 MARCH 2020

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In accordance with legal and regulatory provisions in force, the Management Board has convened you here in order to inform you on the
management of your company and its subsidiaries and to submit for your approval the financial statements for the year ended

31 December 2019.

Founded in 1969 in the Arve Valley, in the Haute-Savoie region of France, and now operating in 58 countries, Somfy is the preferred partner
for window and door automation and a pioneer in the connected home. The Group is constantly innovating to guarantee comfort,
well-being and safety in the home and is committed to promoting sustainable development.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR

FIRST-TIME APPLICATION OF IFRS 16

IFRS 16 “Leases”, whose application was mandatory from
1January 2019, was applied for the first time to the financial
statements to 31December 2019, using the simplified
retrospective approach.

The impact of this first-time adoption on existing leases at
1January 2019 was €42.1 million on non-current assets and
financial debt and €14.1 million on EBITDA for the financial year.
The impact on shareholders’ equity, current operating result and
net profit is not material.

CHANGES TO THE CONSOLIDATION SCOPE

There were no material changes to the consolidation scope during
2019 financial year.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The Court of Appeal of Chambéry issued its ruling on 21 May 2019
on the dispute between Spirel employees and Somfy SA. The claims
of the employees in respect of the alleged deliberate bankruptcy of
Spirel and the non-material damage caused as a result of anxiety,
disappointment and vexation were judged inadmissible, thereby
confirming the April 2017 ruling of the High Court of Albertville. The
employees filed an appeal in cassation in August 2019.

It should be noted that their claims for damages totalled
€8.2 million. The liquidator of the company Spirel had also sought
to have Somfy SA ordered to refund advances of €2.9 million paid
by the AGS (Guarantee Fund for the Payment of Salary Claims) in
the event the disposal was declared null and void.

Proceedings before the Labour Court — dismissed in 2016 and 2018
and involving the employees contesting the grounds for their

~ %  |v(}u tv fv Z) i jv Z 0 1(

SOMPFY — ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019,

dismissal and claiming damages of a substantially similar amount
to that sought before the Court of Appeal — are still ongoing.

These factors do not alter the Group’s risk evaluation.
Consequently, it continues to qualify these risks as contingent
liabilities and no provision was thus recognised in relation to these
disputes at 31 December 2019.

On 5January 2015, Somfy SA transferred its 46.1% direct and
indirect equity investment in the share capital of CIAT Group to
United Technologies Corporation. On 31 March 2016, United
Technologies Corporation filed a complaint against the sellers of
the CIAT shares under the liability guarantee for a total of
€28.6 million (Somfy’s share being €13.2 million). The Group
considers these requests to be unfounded, and _ insufficiently
detailed and justified. In mid-November 2017, UTC brought an
action against the sellers before the Paris Commercial Court for the
liability guarantee. Proceedings before the Commercial Court and
the Court of Appeal are ongoing.

As the proceedings and the documentation provided by UTC
currently stand, the Group continues to contest the entirety of
UTC’s claims and remains confident regarding the outcome of this
dispute. It has qualified the risk as a contingent liability and no
provision was therefore recognised at 31 December 2019.

At 31 December 2019, Somfy SA’s financial statements include a
receivable for deferred settlement in relation to the sale of the CIAT
shares for the sum of €9.7 million. In early July 2017, Somfy SA and
the other sellers brought an action against UTC before the Paris
Commercial Court seeking the fulfilment of the acquisition contract
and the settlement of the deferred payments falling due. These
proceedings are still ongoing. Somfy SA remains confident regarding
the settlement of these sums and therefore no writedown in
relation to these receivables was recognised at 31 December 2019.

NEW ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE

The building industry is undergoing profound transformations with
accelerated digitalisation, the need for greater energy efficiency,
ever shorter innovation cycles and more. These are all challenges
that Somfy has begun to tackle thanks to its Believe & Act strategic
plan first implemented in 2017 but now need to take a step
further.

The current organisation, whose foundations date back to 2004,
has enabled the Group to expand its range of applications,
becoming a pioneer of smart home solutions and expanding its
geographical presence. After a decade of strong and profitable
growth and progress in its main market segments, Somfy aims to
accelerate in order to continue establishing its leadership in its
markets.

In order to meet these challenges, the Group has set up a new
organisation guided by three major principles: a function-based

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD MANAGEMENT REPORT

architecture to support the Group’s development; a
customer-centric organisation with reduced interfaces to facilitate
decision-making and optimise resource allocation; and finally a
strong focus on the digitalisation of its products, customer
relations and operations.

The first definitive act of this change is the appointment of a new
Executive Committee, along with the creation of a Strategy &
Insights Division, the reorganisation of the three activities that are
Home & Building, Access and Connected Solutions into three
Divisions: Products & Services, Engineering & Customer
Satisfaction, and Operations & Supply Chain. Finally, the sales
subsidiaries will be split into two new geographical areas, for
greater transversality.

In addition to the new organisation, the Executive
Committee—under the supervision of Jean Guillaume Despature,
Chairman of the Management Board—will work on defining and
implementing a new, three-year strategic plan, based on the
achievements brought by the Believe & Act plan.

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PARENT COMPANY DATA

Over the year ended 31 December 2019, Somfy SA generated sales
of €3.7 million. Net financial income amounted to €122.1 million,
including €126.2 million in dividends paid by the subsidiaries in
respect of their net profit for the year to 31 December 2018.

Net profit was €115.0 million, after inclusion of a tax income of
€2.9 million.

CONSOLIDATED DATA

SALES

Group sales were €1,200.2 million over the year just ended, an
increase of 6.1% on a like-for-like basis, including 4.7% in the first
half-year and 7.5% in the second, and of 6.5% in real terms.

This expansion follows several years of steady growth and reflects
progress within all geographical regions, with the exception of
Africa & the Middle East, for contextual reasons. It attests to the

SALES BY CUSTOMER LOCATION

growing interest of all types of consumers in motorised and
connected solutions for the home, due to the need for comfort
and safety and the growing awareness of energy and
environmental issues.

The most noteworthy growth was recorded in Central & Eastern
Europe, as a result of excellent performances in Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic, as well as Northern Europe.

Significant increases were also posted in China, France and
Germany, as well as in Central & South America and North
America, thanks to a sharp upturn over the last quarter,
particularly in Brazil and the United States. Growth was however
more modest in Asia-Pacific (excluding China) and Southern
Europe.

In contrast, the trend remained negative in Africa & the Middle
East, although it improved significantly over the second half-year.
Sales of the now equity-accounted Chinese subsidiary Dooya
totalled €187.5 million over the financial year, an increase of 9.3%
in real terms and 8.2% on a like-for-like basis.

RESULTS

Current operating result stood at €204.8 million over the financial
year, up 15.2% in real terms, and represented 17.1% of sales,
compared with 15.8% in the previous year. It benefited from a
positive impact of €3.1 million from changes in exchange rates and
€0.4 million from the application of the new lease recognition rule
(IFRS 16).

This improvement was due to both high sales, particularly during
the second half-year, and a modest increase in structure costs, as a
result of the normalisation of “strategic” expenditure following a
period of substantial investment.

Consolidated net profit grew 16.3% to €163.2 million. It includes a
net non-current operating expense of €3.2 million, a positive
contribution from associates of €3.8 million and an income tax
charge of €37.2 million.

Reflecting these solid results, return on capital employed (ROCE) was
22.2% (23.7% restated for the impact of IFRS 16), compared with
20.4% in the previous year.

SEGMENT REPORTING AT 31 DECEMBER 2019

FINANCIAL POSITION

Group equity rose from €894.4 million to €1,012.8 million over the
financial year, while the net financial surplus rose from
€222.4 million to €310.5 million, despite the recognition of
financial liabilities of €48.3 million following the application of
IFRS 16 to leases.

The hike in net financial surplus was due to the increase in cash
flow and the decline in working capital requirements.

POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENT

Within the context of the current epidemic (Covid-19), the global picture remains uncertain and is evolving rapidly. At this stage, it is difficult
to measure the consequences in 2020 on business activity and on the Group in particular”.

OUTLOOK

The ongoing changes in the building sector, due to the energy transition, digitalisation and changes to society have led the Group to review its
structure and to announce, in January 2020, the appointment of a new Executive Committee, a consequence of which was the merger of the
three existing activities into a single unit and the re-segmentation of the ten geographic regions into two major sales territories.

SOMPFY — ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019,
04 MANAGEMENT BOARD MANAGEMENT REPORT

This restructuring, guided by a long-term project named Ambition 2030, will help improve the efficiency of operating processes, thanks in
particular to a streamlined organisational structure as well as greater customer proximity and a better allocation of resources. It will also serve
as a platform for defining and implementing the strategic plan over the coming years.

Investment will continue to enable the Group to strengthen its positioning and competitive advantage within its core business, and will
specifically focus on product innovation, optimising information systems with the roll-out of the new integrated management software
package (SAP ERP), and the digitalisation of ranges and operations.

The policy of openness and partnerships will be pursued in parallel, and will continue to fit in with the same strategy of collaborating with
complementary partners and accessing new ecosystems that are compatible with the international standard Zigbee 3.0”, thereby positioning
the Group as an undisputed leader in the world of the connected home.

The Group was not adversely affected by Brexit in 2019 and does not expect to be in 2020. However, within the context of the current
epidemic (Covid-19), the global picture remains uncertain and is evolving rapidly. At this stage, it is difficult to measure the consequences in
2020 on business activity and on the Group in particular”,

INFORMATION ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
(ARTICLES L. 233-1 AND L. 233-26 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

In 2019, the Research and Development activities carried out in
line with the established roadmap. The Group filed 44 patent
applications with the patent office INPI (Institut National de la
Propriété Industrielle) which had published 38 of them in 2018. At
the end of 2019, Somfy had a portfolio of 2,212 registered patents.
Thanks to the eco-design efforts made in 2019, more than 50% of
Somfy products sold worldwide will be Act for Green’ certified in
2020. Act for Green’ certification is one of the levers of the
Group’s environmental programme aimed at reducing its carbon
footprint.

76 new products and services marketed by the Group in 2019

In October 2019, the Group presented its first motorised sliding
window to the market. Following three years of research, in joint
development with the French group Liébot, there are 15 patents
pending in relation to this project, including nine for Somfy and
two jointly innovated with its partner. With a motor integrated
into a sliding window, this range is a precursor of future
developments to address environmental challenges related to
indoor air quality, while overcoming ventilation related
constraints: lack of time, concerns regarding burglary or loss of
heat. This initial project from the new “Somfy air” programme won
the “Innovation Award” at the 2019 Batimat Mondial du Batiment
trade show.

In 2019, specific efforts were made to strengthen the Interior
Product range. A preview of Somfy’s range integrating the global
radio standard Zigbee 3.0 was unveiled at the 2019 CES trade
show, before its launch at the CEDIA Expo home technologies
trade show in the United States. Zigbee 3.0 is now the undisputed
standard for the Connected Home. Backed by an alliance of more
than 400 manufacturers including Amazon, Apple, Google and
IKEA, it guarantees the interoperability of their equipment. Silent
motorisation is also a major technology lever in the Interior
Products market. Launched commercially in late 2019, the Sonesse
ULTRA range was presented at the 2020 CES trade show. At 38
decibels, which equates to the sound level of the rustling of leaves,
the new Sonesse ULTRA range is the quietest motorisation solution
for blinds and curtains on the market.

Lastly, the collaborative creativity platform My Somfy Lab has
stepped up its activity. In 2019, 14 research projects were the
subject of user feedback, including six in the form of user tests of
the solutions (beta-tests) and the remainder in the form of
exploratory studies. This interactive platform which comprises
3,645 registered contributors (an increase of 44%) resulted in
1,307 ideas and 6,092 questionnaire responses, an intense level of
activity that included 2,151 comments and more than 7,421
“Likes”.

2019 NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT

PRESENTATION OF THE BUSINESS MODEL

PRESENTATION OF SOMFY

Somfy has spent the last 50 years making everyday life easier for
millions of users around the world by developing smart home and
building management solutions. The Group innovates to automate
and connect all types of equipment to open, close and shade
windows, terraces, doors and gates using connected motors that
operate them together using intelligence and make them
interoperable with other household equipment. In addition to
motorisation, Somfy solutions include accessories for control,
comfort and security. Occupants are central to Somfy’s concerns
and the Group constantly strives to create reliable long-term
solutions that offer a better way of living and increased well-being
for everyone. This is what Somfy calls smart living.

Somfy has 6,067 employees worldwide, of which 5,711 excluding
temporary staff, operates in 58 countries, and generated sales of
€1,200.2 million in 2019, up by 6.5% in real terms, with a current
operating result of €204.8 million, ] X17X1% of sales.

The Somfy spirit and its vision for tomorrow

Somfy shares its vision for the future with every employee ] a
document that has been translated into 17 languages, called Somfy
Spirit, which lies at the heart of the Group’s collective vision:

“Inspiring a better way of living accessible to all”.

21

This vision is born of the firm belief that everyone throughout the
world aspires to a safe, healthy and eco-friendly living
environment for themselves and their family. To meet these basic
needs and improve living environments, Somfy has created
innovative solutions for the home and buildings in three areas:

— comfort and well-being for everyone irrespective of their age;

— security for both people and property;

— environmental conservation.

Today, Somfy offers a line of products that is unique to the
market

For the past SOyears, the Group has been improving living
environments by integrating technology into window, terrace,
door and gate equipment. At the forefront of the digitalisation of
buildings, Somfy is a pioneer in smart living or connected home,
designing for occupants new functions for new and existing
buildings that match the aspirations of everyone. Somfy’s ambition
is to make smart living accessible to all and release the potential of
the connected home through attractive product lines and
interoperability with home equipment and its new control
methods — voice, home automation, artificial intelligence.

Through each of its subsidiaries and brands, the Group is
committed to making these innovations as widely accessible as
possible. Somfy is a genuine local stakeholder, with a presence on
five continents, and adapts its product lines to the expectations
and specific features of each of its markets. In this way, Somfy
contributes to the development of both its customers and its
partners, by making the excellence of its products and services a
constant objective.

Somfy’s growth and success depend on the entrepreneurial spirit
of all the men and women who make up the Group. It is also based
on their personal quest for individual fulfilment through a
collective project. Over time, increasing numbers of market players
have been involved in this project, on the clear assumption that

SOMPFY — ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019
04 MANAGEMENT BOARD MANAGEMENT REPORT

benefits for the end user cannot be fully fulfilled unless all
stakeholders in the ecosystem contribute to and play their part in
value creation through partnerships.

Development model

Providing useful, safe, simple and accessible solutions is at the
heart of the value creation model that Somfy develops with all its
stakeholders. This commitment influences the adoption of new
technologies by the user and by the building industry, as well as
the adaptability of solutions to each person’s own habits, to
ensure a better living environment for all.

Today, Somfy continues:

— to create and develop new markets as part of a business model
that will enable everyone — the Group and its stakeholders — to
provide their own distinctive features and share the benefits;

— to provide tailored and sustainable solutions that promote
energy savings and offer comfort and security, and to do so by
implementing the vision that guides the Group — “Inspiring a
better way of living accessible to all”, and its new ambition,
“Being the preferred partner for window and door automation”.

In order to ensure its continuing development, a three-year

strategic plan, Believe & ACT!, was rolled out between 2017 and

2019, incorporating four drivers: “Closer to our End Users”,

“Bolder on the Interior Market”, “Stronger on Operational

Excellence” and “Better Together”.

In 2019, Somfy realised that its markets were changing at an

accelerated pace, led by changing lifestyles and working patterns,

the growing digitalisation of houses and buildings, the need for
better energy efficiency, ever shorter innovation cycles, and

rw ].

smartphone driven connectivity. These changes are mirrored in the

company and call for rapid responses and innovative solutions.

Somfy has therefore looked ahead to the next ten years in order to

develop a new strategic framework, Ambition 2030, which is based

around four pillars:

— delivering on performance, with a new segmentation of its
activities and territories;

— adding more value for customers and users, through Somfy’s
products, services and contribution to a more sustainable
development;

— inventing the smart living of the future, by offering innovation
and partnerships;

— anew mindset, “One Somfy, One Team”, which is the human
pillar of Ambition 2030, to leverage the strength of being a
Group.

BASIC ORGANISATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF SOMFY

In order to address the increasingly radical transformations of the
building industry and oversee the objectives of its ten-year project,
Ambition 2030, on 1 January 2020 the Group implemented a new
structure guided by three major principles:

— a function-based structure, constructed around — global
professions in order to support the Group’s development;

— a more customer-centric organisation, with a reduced number
of interfaces to ensure rapid decision-making and to optimise
the allocation of resources;

— an organisational model that facilitates the digitalisation of
products, customer relations and operations.

DESCRIPTION OF GROUP ACTIVITIES

Somfy is first and foremost an equipment manufacturer and assembler that designs, assembles and supplies motors and automation
solutions (control systems and sensors) for manufacturers and installers who integrate the solution into a carrier product: blind, shutter,
door or gate, to then market this, sometimes bespoke, end product within a network or to resellers, or to the installer on a site.

Somfy also develops finished products (certain motors, automation products and control systems, connected objects, digital applications)

that may be sold by prescribers, networks, retailer installers or resellers, ] large specialist and DIY stores, and online, either directly or
indirectly.

Finally, the products may, by design, be installed indiscriminately in individual homes, small businesses, apartment blocks, office blocks,
hotels and collective residences.

This diversity has two consequences. The first is that the markets in which Somfy operates are globalised on account of the size of the main
participants, and yet very local as they depend on the uses of a particular building and construction methods. The second is the relative
overlapping of Somfy’s different product categories, which gives the Group the option of combining its brands and ranges to provide
customers with solutions that incorporate ranges from across all its activities.

23 SOMPFY — ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019
04 MANAGEMENT BOARD MANAGEMENT REPORT

For these reasons, Somfy retains the geographic dimension as the key to understanding its performance to the extent that it optimally
reports the underlying dynamics in the Group’s markets: the buoyancy of the construction and renovation market, momentum of

distribution circuits, and changing occupant uses.

A description of the performance of the different geographical areas can be found on page 15 of this report.

A SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT POLICY IN LINE
WITH THE GROUP’S AMBITION AND VISION

KEY FEATURES OF THIS POLICY

With the strategic framework Ambition 2030 rolled out over the
course of 2019, Somfy is incorporating its Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) ahead of its strategy in order to make it the
foundation for the Group’s sustainable growth. The CSR topic
features in each of the four strategic pillars of Ambition 2030.

This thought process has helped to formally set out Somfy’s
sustainable development policy, which is structured into four
sections in line with each of the pillars of Ambition 2030:

1. Improving living environments for all;

2. Consumer respect;

3. Reduction of environmental impact;

4. Employee commitment.

SOMPFY — ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019,

24

Given that ethics in everyday behaviour and compliance with the
law are prerequisites, they form a transversal axis of this
sustainable development policy.

The four sections of Somfy’s sustainable development policy
respectively address four long-term objectives, which are
themselves structured into three-level action plans: immediate
compliance, three-year strategy and ambition by 2030.

These four long-term objectives are:

to make progress in achieving the vision, “Inspiring a better way
of living accessible to all”;

to have loyal customers and consumers who trust the Group;

to make the environment an innovation driver for Somfy and its
value chain;

to involve and motivate employees in line with the vision.

These objectives are consistent with the sustainable development
policy pursued in 2019, the main programmes of which are
developed as part of the management of the non-financial risks
expanded upon below.
04 MANAGEMENT BOARD MANAGEMENT REPORT

GOVERNANCE

The strategic framework of the Group’s sustainable development policy within Ambition 2030 was set out by the Strategic and Executive
Committees. This policy was presented to the Supervisory Board as part of Ambition 2030.

In 2019, a strengthened Sustainable Development Department was created, with effect from 1 January 2020. It is attached to the CEO and
Chairman of the Management Board, and includes environmental performance and social commitment, as well as the teams from the
Somfy Foundation and the Endowment Fund Les Petites Pierres.

In 2019, the Steering Committee for Sustainable Development brought together the Sustainable Development Department with the HR,
Communications and Procurement functions as well as the Chair of the Ethics Committee. It ensured the monitoring of the various policies
implemented. It actively contributed to the Strategic Committee’s work on CSR.

The various policies are communicated to the Group’s head office and its subsidiaries ] coordinators or the local manager. In addition, the
Human Resources Department works in coordination with the heads of the Foundation and of the Group’s Social Commitment to make the
Group’s socially responsible policy a driver of commitment and belonging for employees and candidates, and it also helps to roll out these
policies within the Group. Across Somfy Activités SA’s scope, the Act for Green® and Employee Commitment indicators are included in the
employee incentive scheme.

ASSOCIATED RISKS

The challenges related to this sustainable development policy have long been acknowledged and were already taken into consideration in
the strategic plan prior to Ambition 2030 (source — Somfy 2018 Annual Financial Report). The risks were identified within the framework of
the Sustainable Development Steering Committee based on ISO 9004, Managing for the Sustained Success of an Organisation - a Quality
Management Approach, as well as on the basis of the materiality matrix developed across the scope of Somfy Activités SA, which
complements this approach and confirms that this sustainable development policy is in line with the expectations of stakeholders. The
relevance of these risks, the long-term objectives detailed previously and the policies to be implemented have all been reformulated or
confirmed by the Strategic Committee as part of the work to draft Ambition 2030.

This work has highlighted four types of risk for Somfy. Firstly, the issue of sustainable development is a lever that Somfy must take
ownership of. Its business model and solutions help to limit the contribution of buildings to global warming, and Somfy seeks to serve the
common good in both its vision and its values. These are therefore significant commitment factors for employees and stakeholders.
Secondly, climate change is in itself a risk for everyone, and that we must strive to combat both collectively and individually. There also
exists, for all companies, a risk to image and reputation from doing nothing or not doing enough to promote sustainable development,
which is heightened for companies that claim to make a positive contribution to the fight against global warming or that they are acting in
the public interest. Lastly, social, technological and environmental changes all have impacts on activities, which we must take into account
and anticipate.

Themes Major non-financial risks Pages
Social/Human Capital Inadequate resources in terms of talents and skills 26
Employee health and safety 28

Environmental Impact of global warming on the business model 30
Acceptability of solutions and processes 30

Contribution to climate change 31

Societal Company reputation and image with its stakeholders 34
Attractiveness of the company and its employments areas 35

Ethics and combating corruption Risk of non-ethical behaviour and corruption 37
Non-compliance of the supply chain with CSR standards 38

Given the nature of its activities, Somfy believes that the following topics do not represent major CSR risks and do not warrant further
discussion in this Management Report: combatting food waste, food poverty and animal welfare and promoting responsible, fairly traded
and sustainable food consumption. Fight against tax evasion is not considered as a major CSR risk. It is developed on page 39.

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD MANAGEMENT REPORT

SOCIAL POLICY PERFORMANCE

The professional development of employees is critical to their engagement, which in turn drives innovation and performance and is
therefore a key growth driver. The Group’s appeal and its employees’ engagement are linked to the professional development offered and
also to the respect they are given through health and safety, and more generally their working conditions.

In 2018, Somfy’s biennial commitment survey had a participation rate of 82.1%, a high score that demonstrates the deep commitment of

employees.

OVERALL GROUP WORKFORCE AND EMPLOYEE STRUCTURE BY AGE AND GEOGRAPHIC REGION

At 31 December 2019, total Group workforce was 5,711 people (excluding temporary workers), compared with 5,677 in 2018, an increase

of 0.6%, and was analysed as follows:

IMPROVING THE VISIBILITY OF RECRUITMENTS, RETAINING TALENTS AND DEVELOPING THE SKILLS THE COMPANY NEEDS

Human capital is an important element of the business model.
Through their skills and expertise, this human capital gives Somfy
the ability to respond effectively to the challenges posed by the
digital transformation of companies, new business models and the
development of the company.

In order to prevent an inadequacy of talents and skills in this
human capital, Somfy has introduced a policy of employee
professional development which aims to gain the maximum
potential from this human capital by developing their internal
employability. The areas of this policy are: improving the visibility
of internal recruitments, retaining talents, and the development of
the skills the company needs.

In addition, Somfy is pursuing a policy that maximises the results of
its societal and environmental measures to make it attractive to
external candidates.

The indicators are the following: staff turnover, change in the
implementation rates of the People Review (support in
professional development J] the assessment of skills and the
recognition of performance). These indicators and all social data
are monitored within the scope known as the CSR (Corporate
Social Responsibility) scope, in which the monitoring of such data
makes sense. It relates to 41 Group companies and a workforce at
31 December 2019 of 5,269 people, representing 92.3% of the
Group’s total workforce.

Plan to support the professional development
of employees and internal mobility

Roll-out of the application tool within the Group

In order to promote internal mobility within the Group, a single
tool for managing internal and external applications has been
implemented across all the French legal entities and the Eastern

SOMPFY — ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019,

26

Europe Business Area (Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania,
Russia, Lithuania and Ukraine). The ambition is to continue to roll
out this solution to other subsidiaries in 2020 in order to continue
to improve internal mobility within the Group.

Improvement of the People Review process

The People Review process helps to identify those of the
employees capable of moving on to positions of greater
responsibility within the Group. This process feeds into succession
plans to ensure the continuity of execution necessary for the
Group's performance in the event of an employee's departure. It
also makes it possible to identify the collective training needs of
employees. This process relies on support that is progressively
enhanced and whose international roll-out (SOPEM in Poland in
particular) is continuing.

Internal mobility and promotion

Each time this is possible, Somfy prioritises internal mobility by
drawing on employees who are in a position to progress within the
Group.

Skills mapping

A substantial part of Somfy’s success and appeal is based on its
ability to develop the talent of its current and future employees. In
order to make development paths more effective, Somfy has a
shared framework to map its jobs and its skills. Launched in
September 2018, this project aims to identify its business sectors
and existing jobs, in order to define the skills required to perform
them. At the end of 2019, 60% of Somfy’s professions were
covered. This framework is integrated into the performance
assessment tool which feeds the People Review process. This
facilitates a uniform assessment of employees’ skills to identify and
then address the gap between skills needs and skills recorded.
Skills development plan
The skills development plan is one of the outcomes of the People
Review process combined with the professional appraisal
interview. It is the result of the consolidation of the skills
development requirements identified by the dialogue between the
manager and their employee and translates initially into individual
training or guidance plans. It subsequently outlines the structuring
axes of the training policy, that are three to date:

— improving the operational excellence of teams: quality training,
training on working methods, integration of new employees;

— working better together: training in management, in health and
safety, intercultural training, training trainers, and transversal
operation for business experts;

— specific business training: training in new technologies, business
intelligence.

Attractiveness of Somfy to external candidates

Somfy is an attractive company. Over the 2019 financial year, the
workforce grew 1.68% over the CSR scope, going from 5,182 to
5,269 employees. 70% of this workforce is accounted for by the
seven industrial sites within the CSR scope.

Results of the policy of employee professional development

90% of the increase in staff was split between France, Eastern and
Central Europe, and Asia-Pacific, primarily within the entity Somfy
Activités SA and at the manufacturing sites SOPEM in Poland and
Lian Da in China.

100% of the decrease in the workforce relates to the Southern
Europe and Middle East region, mainly the Middle East scope.

The percentage of completion of People Reviews fell slightly, from 94% in 2018 to 90% as a result of a reorganisation within one of the

Percentage of employees who progressed (internal mobility or promotion)
The rate of internal development rose slightly between 2018 and 2019, going from 7.74% to 8.29% of the workforce. Management will
continue its efforts (definition of a mobility policy in 2020) in order to improve the rate of internal mobility.

Prevention of psychosocial risks

The prevention of psychosocial risks requires training that takes
place either face-to-face or remotely (e-learning), as well a
communication campaign. E-learning training on the definition of
psychosocial risks is accessible to all Group employees. Somfy
Activités SA managers received training on how to spot minor signs
of cases of psychosocial risks.

Lastly, a mapping of those involved in the prevention of
psychosocial risks was conducted within Somfy Activités SA.

Listening and personalised support service within Somfy

Somfy’s Management wanted to introduce an anonymous
telephone listening and personalised support service. This service
provides emotional support at difficult times, offering employees
and managers information, guidance and assistance in seeking
solutions appropriate to their situation.

All the preventive measures related to accidents at work and
musculoskeletal disorders have had a significant impact on both
the frequency (5% reduction) and severity (17% reduction in days’
absence due to accidents) of work-related accidents.

This reduction primarily relates to the industrial sites where the
risk of accidents is the most significant.

The other indicator monitored is the average number of days’
absence per individual: this indicator stood at 11.23 days in 2019
compared with 10.32 days in 2018. This increase was primarily due
to a rise in the number of days’ absence for illness (up 10.7% in
2019 in relation to 2018) excluding occupational disease,
work-related accidents and commuting accidents.

ENSURING DIVERSITY OF EMPLOYEES WITHIN THE GROUP TO
IMPROVE PERFORMANCE

Given the nature of the Group’s activities and its presence in
58 countries, with a workforce comprising many nationalities,
Somfy does not consider the issue of diversity to constitute a risk
but rather an opportunity. Ambition 2030 also underlines the
importance for Somfy of having diverse and inclusive teams, willing
to welcome people with disabilities or with unusual professional
backgrounds.

Gender parity

This measure is intended to achieve better gender parity in the
company. Within the scope of Somfy Activités SA, it is driven by an
Agreement on Gender Equality in the Workplace, with in particular
a renewed objective to achieve a rate of 30% female at manager
level by 2021. This agreement also contains areas requiring
attention in relation to remuneration. A process has been
introduced to ensure that individuals on maternity and paternity
leave are not excluded from wage increase.

In 2019, as in 2018, Somfy achieved a score of 89 on the gender
parity index within the scope of Somfy Activités SA. At Group level,
in 2019 the ratio of men to women in the workforce was stable
with a breakdown of 57% men and 43% women.

Combatting prejudice and exclusion

Through the Disability Agreement of 21October 2019, the
Management of Somfy Activités SA underlined its desire to initiate
a drive and the mobilisation of everyone to promote the
employment of workers with disabilities. This agreement, covering
2020-2022, is intended to improve the overall employment rate
through action in the following areas:

— developing the recruitment of new employees with disabilities
on the various sites;

— improving measures to accommodate and
employees within the Somfy Activités SA sites;

— continuing to apply measures to retain employees in the
workforce, in particular through communication with disabled
employees;

— developing relationships and framework agreements with
service providers in the sector, and enabling them in particular
to gain new skills;

— improving communication with employees, and their managers
and those involved in the disabled sector in relation to the
disability policy, raising awareness and training;

— maintaining the momentum of the disability policy.

ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY PERFORMANCE

Somfy is an industrial company whose products are installed in
buildings. Worldwide, buildings account for approximately 20% of
greenhouse gas generation. By promoting the smart control of
opening and closing systems in homes and buildings, Somfy helps
to reduce their energy consumption, by acting on light levels and
by reducing needs for heating and air conditioning. Thus, Somfy
solutions improve the energy efficiency of the buildings in which
they are installed.
Analysis of environmental concerns therefore focused on three
aspects: consideration of the impact of global warming on the
business model; the common good and taking into account the
impact of operations on global warming and more generally the
environment; and the potential operational consequences for the
activities.

The risks related to climate change identified are:

— impact of global warming on the business model:

The solutions provided by the Group offer energy savings in the
buildings in which they are installed. Demand for the solutions
offered by Somfy should remain steady and this environment
should stimulate innovation in research into responses to global
warming;

— perceptions of Somfy’s
stakeholders:
Independently of the notion of vulnerability in relation to
climate change, the desire to limit the environmental impact of
its operations is a priority for Somfy. How its action plans are
viewed by its stakeholders is key to ensuring the acceptability of
the Group’s operations in the long-term in the territories in
which it operates. The Group must lead by example and help to
adapt to climate change in the regions in which it operates in
order to ensure the longevity of both its activity and its strategy
of attracting and retaining talent;

— impact on the industrial structure:

Climate change involves impacts that could affect the Group’s
operations, in particular access to energy and water, as well as
physical effects on buildings. These risks have been assessed as
minor. Conversely, the environmental impact of its operations
contributes to global warming and must therefore be taken into
account in the general interest and to meet the expectations of
stakeholders.

To manage these risks, Somfy implements a general policy of

reducing its environmental impact.

GENERAL POLICY TO MANAGE ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE
RELATED RISKS

Combatting global warming is a priority for the Group, which was
reaffirmed by General Management in 2019. An effective policy of
combatting climate change involves firstly measuring, and then
reducing, greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020, Somfy is launching a
Carbon Assessment’ globally, taking into account its entire carbon
footprint. This assessment will form the baseline year from which
the company’s own energy conservation and efficiency targets will
be developed in order to manage the Group’s impact on global
warming. The “We Act for Green” programme is the manifestation
of Somfy’s environmental policy. “We Act for Green” is aimed at
reducing Somfy’s environmental impact and_ transforming
environmental problems into innovation opportunities for the
Group and its value chain. It is structured around four pillars:

~ }v uv ] } lv }v XxX

SOMPFY — ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019,

1. “Green Benefits’: Somfy products and solutions enable
buildings to reduce their energy consumption;

2. “Green Products”: Somfy products and solutions are
eco-designed in accordance with the “Act for Green”
framework;

3. “Green Teams”: Somfy products are developed, manufactured
and distributed by teams who introduce environmentally
friendly practices to their workplaces;

4. “Green Operations”: Somfy's production sites take into
account their environmental impact.

Green Benefits

Solar protection systems motorised and automated by Somfy’s
solutions help to reduce the energy consumption of buildings. This
is achieved both by limiting the winter heat loss of buildings and by
protecting them from the heat in summer, thereby improving
comfort in the summer and helping to reduce the installed air
conditioning capacity.

The ONIX, ES-SO, ESTIA, BBSA and London South Bank University
studies have all shown that Somfy solutions and their carrier
products could lead to a reduction in energy usage in relation to
the heating, air conditioning and lighting of buildings. The ONIX
study demonstrated a reduction of approximately 29% under real
conditions. Large-scale heating studies of buildings are ongoing in
order to consolidate these results, refine the Group’s calculation
models and better quantify their impacts. In any event, the interim
results of this work are similar and confirm the positive impact of
the Group’s solutions on the energy consumption of buildings.
Somfy’s business model as a response to global warming issues is
reaffirmed as part of Ambition 2030 and in its pillars
“Forward-looking in Smart Living” and “Rising value to Customers”.

Green Products

These products are awarded an Act for Green® label when they

meet stringent eco-design requirements.

The origins of Act for Green® can be traced back to the results of a

Carbon Assessment® carried out in 2012". This Carbon

Assessment® had established work on electricity consumption and

the use of raw materials as priorities.

Act for Green® is based on a framework taken into account by

Research & Development teams. It incorporates requirements that

are broken down according to several subject areas:

— controlling greenhouse gas emissions through moderate
electricity use and the choice of appropriate raw materials;

— seeking to use recycled and recyclable raw materials in the
composition of products;

— materials selected for their low impact on health and the
environment;

— product durability;

— a statement of the environmental impacts in line with the PEP
ecopassport® programme in which Somfy participates. This
programme, developed by the electricity industry, defines a
standardised method for making environmental declarations in
accordance with international regulations (ISO14025 &
ISO 14040s). The information contained in this PEP ecopassport®
has been independently verified by Bureau Veritas CODDE.

A roadmap for the integration of projects in the Act for Green®

programme had been drafted in collaboration with development

teams for the next two years.
The target defined at the start of the policy, in 2015, was to
achieve certification for 80% of amounts of Somfy brand products
sold in 2020. The updated roadmap shows that the threshold
achieved at the end of 2020 will be above 65%.

Requests, both from customers and regulatory, in relation to
awareness of the substances used in products have continued.
Somfy actively monitors regulatory developments and conducts
detailed laboratory analysis of substances. The Group is monitoring
the progress and implementation of these regulations by taking
part in the FIEEC’s” “GT Substances” working groups.

In Europe, end-of-life products are collected and processed under
the WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) Directive.
These collection and processing initiatives are organised by
environmental organisations with which Somfy has contracts in
different countries of the European Union.

In general terms, Somfy contributes to the implementation of the
circular economy through its involvement in_ professional
organisations such as the FIEEC, IGNES” and the Technical
Committee 111°).

Green Teams

Driven by the desire to protect the environment and in accordance
with its values and those of its workforce, Somfy encourages its
employees to increase the number of green initiatives and best
practices. Somfy has committed to promoting environmentally
friendly practices amongst its employees and its local ecosystem: a
network of volunteer eco-ambassadors promotes environmental
initiatives amongst their colleagues. In 2019, this network of
eco-ambassadors was made up of 43 people, across 17 of the
Group’s sites in  12countries. The network covers
3,165 employees, equating to 55% of Somfy’s workforce.

These eco-practices are coordinated and promoted through a
webzine, website and in-house social network. In addition, the
Group has incorporated the presentation of its sustainable
development policy and values into the induction days for new
employees.

The Green Teams programme has a dual objective. It involves
raising awareness and changing mindsets to ensure everyone
understands the importance of environmental issues, while

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD MANAGEMENT REPORT

Green Operations

The Group rolls out action plans in order to limit its reliance on
energy supplies.

Moreover, the industrial sites are traditionally subject to physical
risks. In Somfy’s case, its factories are fairly new and built in
accordance with the standards applicable to buildings in the
countries in which Somfy operates.

Climate change is faced with the geographical location of the
Group’s infrastructures. Changes in rainfall and their impact on
water resources is not a direct risk for the Group’s manufacturing
sites. The industrial processes employed in the factories do not use
water. Furthermore, the industrial sites are inland from coastal
areas and are therefore not at risk from rising waters. Lastly, the
number of sites located in areas subject to an increase in the
severity of tropical storms is low. The vast majority of physical risks
related to climate change should therefore not directly affect the
Group’s industrial structure.

ACTIONS AND EFFECTS OF THESE POLICIES ON THE ENERGY
EFFICIENCY OF PRODUCTS AND TAKING CLIMATE CHANGE
INTO ACCOUNT

Results of the Green Buildings action plan

Somfy is a member of the Active House Alliance, which promotes
healthier, more comfortable buildings that do not have a negative
impact on the climate“),

The efficiency of Somfy solutions in reducing the energy
consumption of buildings is also recognised by French legislation.
Its solutions have been integrated into regulation RT2012 which
transposes European Directive EPBD (2010/31/EU) into French law.
It is aimed at reducing by a factor of three the energy consumption
of new buildings so that the construction sector becomes carbon
neutral by 2050.

In this context, animeo Connect, the range of controls for fully
connected solar protection, was awarded the Solar Impulse
Efficient Solution label by the Solar Impulse Foundation. This

responding very favourably to ever greater demands for solution considerably enhances opportunities for energy

Eco-design and Act for Green®

$" #" "

an

Although Somfy solutions help lower the overall carbon impact of
buildings, the Group is also committed to reducing the impact of
its activities on global warming. Somfy is using the results of a
Carbon Assessment® carried ou' using 2011 data. The eco-design
policy is based on this assessment. A new Carbon Assessment® will
be carried out in 2020 in order to update choices. This eco-design
programme, Act for Green®, is gradually being applied to all
product ranges and markets. The project integration targets in the
programme have been met. Compliance with the roadmap permits
its extension, as planned, over the next two years.

In addition, the continuing eco-design efforts are reflected in a
higher rate of products covered in the Somfy portfolio. In 2019, 13
new ranges of products were certified Act for Green’:

— nine motorisation ranges;

— four ranges of control systems.

As a result, the proportion of products sold under the Somfy
brand” which bear the Act for Green” label continues to increase
and rose from 24% in 2018 to 60.77% in 2019. The 2018 figure
(24%) was recalculated in relation to the information published last
year (28%) in order to better match the exact definition of the
indicator and be consistent with the 2019 figure.

into account:

— analyses of the lifecycles of products conducted on the control

— research into the use of recycled plastics is also ongoing.
However, the plastic materials used in Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (EEE) must meet very high specifications and
standards in relation to fire testing and dielectric properties
(notably CEI 335-1, UL 746 C). These materials are not currently
available on the recycled plastics market. Somfy is supporting

}v X¥/v o Jv } Z AJUC v oo
the circular economy-focused work of the FIEEC to make
progress in this field.
Somfy has decided to monitor a significant indicator concerning its
greenhouse gas emissions and regarding which it is able to take
action: the CO, emissions related to the energy consumption of its
electronic motors when on standby.

The data used in the calculation was provided by the Group and
has a low level of uncertainty. However, the emission factor used is
based on average European data, ultimately resulting in a level of
uncertainty classed as medium.

Waste processing

Somfy takes into account the impact of waste on the entire
lifecycle of its products, from their production through to their end
of life reprocessing.

Industrial waste from the Group’s manufacturing sites

Waste ~d} vv 31/12/18 31/12/19

The increase in the total amount of waste generated is 6.3% for a
6.5% increase in activity.

Somfy products are covered by the European WEEE Directive
2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment. Somfy’s
membership of local environmental organisations or trade bodies
professional means that it falls within the scope of this Directive
regarding the processing of end of life products.

Somfy is involved, within its trade associations, in the promotion of
the circular economy within its industry, an example being Somfy’s
active participation in the GT circular economy of the IGNES trade
body in France.

Somfy is also active in this field within the association G.R.E.En
which is testing the software Upcycléa.

Eco-behaviour and eco-habits of employees

Mobility plays an important role in these eco-friendly habits:

The Group’s head office is located in Haute-Savoie, in the Arve
Valley. Due to weather conditions and its specific topography, it is
an area sensitive to episodes of air pollution. It is also covered by
an Air Protection Plan. Somfy focused on measures to help reduce
this pollution by seeking to influence the means of transport used
for commuting to and from work. Several practical steps have been

33

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD MANAGEMENT REPORT

introduced, such as the bicycle mileage allowance, the car sharing
site Klaxit, electric bicycle loans, the partial reimbursement of
season tickets for public transport for Somfy Activités SA, the
installation of electric vehicle charging stations and the gradual
introduction of hybrid (electric and petrol) vehicles to replace
diesel in the company’s vehicle fleet.

The “Mobility Challenge” day, aimed at changing commuting habits
was held again in 2019.

Since the softest mobility is the type that is not undertaken,
agreements have been reached to promote remote working
amongst eligible employees. Currently, out of an estimated
maximum of 1,300 employees eligible to work remotely, more
than 750 have already done so on at least one occasion,
representing a ratio of almost 58% of eligible employees. The
average number of days worked remotely per employee is 16 per
year per person.

Other green habits:

In 2019, at least 19 green habits were included at all the Group’s
locations. They included, in particular, the distribution of
recyclable mugs and containers; the sorting of waste and its
anaerobic digestion for use in public transport; limiting the use of
plastic cups and aluminium capsules for coffee, choosing low
carbon taxi companies, carbon offsetting of a logistics seminar.

At the Cluses company restaurant, proactive measures in favour of
organic food and local produce has increased the amount of
organic food served to 18%.

In respect of reusing IT equipment, 1,298 items were processed in
2019 including 987 computers. The update and removal of
computer data is performed by a company promoting the
employment of disabled people. These computers and various
accessories are then reused, thereby breathing new life into them.
In 2019, 88% of the equipment was reusable, with the remaining
12% sent for recycling.

Involvement of teams in the local ecosystem

Somfy is one of the founder members of the organisation G.R.E.En
(Groupement pour la Responsabilité Environnementale des
Entreprises) which brings together companies and communities
from the Haute-Savoie and Mont-Blanc regions. This organisation
promotes initiatives to support the sustainable development of
these territories. Somfy takes part, for example, in working groups
and active events related to eco-mobility, energy efficiency and
the circular economy.

Somfy is involved locally in the grouping of local authorities’
Regional Air and Energy Climate Plan where a proportion of its
French manufacturing sites are located, the 2CCAM (Communauté
de Communes Cluses Arve & Montagne).

As part of this same drive, the Sustainable Development
Department often leads initiatives to raise awareness amongst
younger generations of sustainable development issues. These
initiatives take the form of participation in presentations and
lessons in primary and secondary schools, and universities in
Haute-Savoie and elsewhere.

Water usage and discharge of wastewater

The industrial assembly processes do not use water. The water
volumes cited below are therefore exclusively related to the daily

Greenhouse gas, combatting global warming and energy
efficiency

In addition to the eco-design measures implemented as part of the
Act for Green’ programme, efforts have been made in relation to
operations.

A Greenhouse Gas Emissions Assessment (GGEA) relating to the
2018 financial year was conducted in 2019 covering the scope of
Somfy Activités SA. This entity includes one of the Group’s major
industrial sites and 29% of its workforce, equating to
1,641 employees out of a total of 5,711. In comparison with the
GGEA completed in 2014, the results are encouraging. The
amounts of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere fell in
absolute terms, down 6% to 3,484 tCO,e, while the workforce grew
by 2.6% over the same period.

A Group-wide Carbon Assessment’ is being prepared for 2020. The
exact quantification of GHG emissions will determine the key
potential for improvement to limit the impact of Somfy’s activities.
The new strategic cycle launched in the same year has made
combatting global warming a major strategic priority.

The greenhouse gas emissions of the manufacturing sites are
monitored and calculated using actual energy usage readings.

efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2019, an

energy audit was carried out at Somfy Activités SA’s sites to

identify new ways of reducing energy consumption.

In 2019, the following began or ended:

— the replacement of old lighting systems with low energy LED
bulbs at the R&D Center, WAY, BFT and Lian Da sites;

— insulation work at the sites;

— boiler replacements.

Measures to support biodiversity

As an industrial business mindful of its carbon footprint, Somfy is
duty bound to focus on protecting biodiversity. A proactive policy
has been introduced, in connection with the drive to make the
Group’s business model carbon neutral.

Somfy Activités SA owns several sites in the heart of the French
Alps, near Mont Blanc. Somfy acts to preserve mountain
ecosystems by becoming involved in local initiatives. The company
is a member of the Club d’Entreprises pour la Montagne et son
Développement Durable (CEM2D).

Environmental certification and compliance

The SOPEM factory in Poland is located on the edge of protected
sites belonging to the Natura 2000 network:

— Puszcza Niepolomicka PLB 120002;

— Torfowisko Wielkie PLH120080.

The factory complies with strict requirements regarding the
protection of its local environment. Compliance with
environmental standards was also a precondition for setting up
any plant.

BFT is ISO 14001 certified in relation to its three major sites.

Lastly, the Group operates in 58 countries. In 2019, the Group was
not the subject of any appeal or proceedings relating to any
potential violation of national environmental regulations in the
countries in which it operates. However, these positive results
cannot be deemed to be an end in themselves and the company
intends to continue to implement proactive policies to ensure that
the number of legal actions remains at zero.

PROGRAMME’S PERFORMANCE IN RELATION
TO SOCIETAL COMMITMENT

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SOCIETAL COMMITMENTS

As with all companies, Somfy must ensure the consistency of both
its image and its reputation. What it promotes in terms of values
and ambition for its employees and customers must correspond to
the reality perceived by them. To embody its vision of “inspiring a
better way of living accessible to all”, Somfy has for a long time
chosen to pursue a committed societal policy, embodying this
vision in initiatives and areas that contribute to the common good
and where Somfy has legitimacy. This consistency is essential to
ensure customer loyalty, maintain the commitment of employees,
retain talents and keep the skills acquired.

Somfy’s societal commitments are focused on two areas: since
2004, a citizen commitment to combat poor housing J] human
and financial sponsorship; and for more than 20years, a
commitment by Somfy to the local and regional ecosystem
surrounding its head office, in Cluses - a policy that is intended to
be duplicated at its other major sites.

In addition to the fact that these commitments are longstanding
and pre-date the existence of reports on CSR in Somfy’s annual
financial report, the risks addressed by this policy of societal
commitment are of two types: firstly, it is a significant driver of
employee commitment, and secondly, it has a positive effect on
Somfy’s image and reputation in the eyes of its stakeholders in
general and promotes the appeal of both Somfy and _ its
employment areas to external candidates.

A CITIZEN AND SPONSORSHIP COMMITMENT COMPONENT
TO EMBODY A VISION AND VALUES

Description of Somfy’s citizen commitment scheme
and sponsorship policy

Somfy’s citizen action embodies a desire to improve living
environments for all, and to make this improvement accessible to
all. Somfy’s policy of citizen commitment took the shape of a
corporate foundation, created in 2004, whose aim was to combat
poor housing and social exclusion |] housing. A leader in the
building industry and a promoter of better housing for all, this area
of involvement where Somfy has credibility is both a logical and
coherent choice. In 2019, the Group committed €350,000 in the
Somfy Foundation’s initiatives and provide both it and the
Endowment Fund Les Petites Pierres with an operational team of
five full-time equivalents.
The Somfy Foundation

The Somfy Foundation is a lever that enables the Group to respond
to the high expectations of its external and internal stakeholders
that there should be consistency between what the Group says
about improving living environments and its day-to-day actions.
The Foundation wants to be a recognised player in the fight against
poor housing. The Foundation combines financial sponsorship
(each year €350,000 is allocated to the Somfy Foundation) and
human sponsorship (every Somfy Activités SA employee can give
three working days to the Somfy Foundation’s initiatives). The
ambition upheld by the Foundation is to continue to build the
human connections that form a balanced society, develop
sustainable relationships and collaborate with community partners
identified as project participants and leaders, by connecting Somfy
employees |] human or skills sponsorship. This helps promote the
values of solidarity within the company.

Seven different formats enable Somfy employees to find the one
that suits them. Somfy offers employees wishing to do so to offer
help to organisations who request it ] their business expertise,
either in the form of long-term individual support (Solidarity
Talents), or in the form of interactive classes for several
organisations (Solidarity Workshops). Human sponsorship is also
provided by the employee giving time to renovation projects, or
projects to improve premises (Solidarity Projects). This format
often takes the form of a team initiative. Another collective format
is that of the hackathon organised each year for the benefit of
organisations to help them resolve any challenges that they face
(Solidarity Challenges). Lastly, support for employees is possible to
help them take their Solidarity Leave: they are granted support
and a budget to enable them, over their time off and for a trip for
which they are responsible, to work with a local organisation. The
last format is intended to support employees ahead of their
retirement, by helping them to explore the voluntary sector and to
help them prepare for this new stage.

Les Petites Pierres Endowment Fund

The Endowment Fund Les Petites Pierres is a crowdfunding
platform initiated by the Somfy Foundation. Based on a digital
crowdfunding platform and personalised support for organisations,
it allows individuals to donate to charity projects in the field of
acceptable housing, with each donation matched by the
Endowment Fund, on the principle of one euro matched for each
euro donated. The ongoing development of the platform has led
the Endowment Fund to open itself to other partners. In addition
to the Somfy Foundation, other major backers of the Fund include
the Schneider Electric Foundation, the BTP+ Foundation and the
company Valfidus.

A House is A Home

The Group considers it important to make a citizen commitment in
the countries in which it operates. With the A House is A Home
programme, launched in January 2015, the Somfy Foundation is
taking action internationally outside the scope of Somfy
Activités SA. Through this programme, Somfy subsidiaries work
alongside the Somfy Foundation. In consultation with the
Foundation, subsidiaries identify projects which promote decent
living conditions for the most underprivileged, and provide
financial support, often topped up by skill-based patronage from
their employees. The A House is A Home programme was
consolidated in 2017 with the introduction of human sponsorship
in certain subsidiaries in addition to the financial support provided.

Employee involvement

As part of the Somfy Foundation’s Solidarity Missions, all
employees have the opportunity to commit some of their working
time, together with the Foundation, to offer their energy and skills
to the charitable organisations. In France, in particular, employees
have a right to three solidarity days each year. This is part of a
human, } } }sponsorship approach which _ offers
organisations essential support and also creates value for company
employees.

Results of Somfy’s citizen commitment scheme
and sponsorship policy

Somfy Foundation initiatives

In 2019, 87 Solidarity Missions were offered to Somfy Activités SA
staff, and 477 individual employees took part in a Solidarity
Mission in 2019 in France. For 2019, the Somfy Foundation granted
funding of €176,406 to the Les Petites Pierres Endowment Fund.

Les Petites Pierres

In the 2019 financial year, 83 non-profit projects were financially
supported by the Les Petites Pierres Endowment Fund. This
represents total grants provided to organisations for 2019 of
€1,157,873, representing 4,303 donations by individuals with
€650,617 matched by partners of the Fund, including €145,000
from the Somfy Foundation.

An impact study conducted in 2019 highlighted that in addition to
project funding, non-profit organisations derive great benefits
from assistance with digital skills learning, thereby helping them to
leverage their various communities and other partners
independently.

A House is a Home

In 2019, ten projects were proposed as part of this programme.
Seven countries took part in the programme and provided financial
or human support to the Somfy Foundation, facilitating the
involvement of 67 individual employees. The countries involved
were France, the United States, Germany, Hungary, Belgium, Brazil
and Australia.

Employee involvement

A single indicator is used to measure the strength of Somfy’s entire
policy relating to societal commitment. It relates to the
involvement of employees in the Foundation’s initiatives,
measured in the number of unique employees who have
participated in the Foundation’s work.

The number of employees participating in these Solidarity Missions
has increased steadily since these initiatives were launched in
July 2012.

In 2019, 545 unique employees took part in a Somfy Foundation
initiative around the world.

A COMMITMENT COMPONENT IN THE REGIONS
AND EMPLOYMENT AREAS IN RELATION TO STAKEHOLDERS

Somfy employees are also engaged in local and national initiatives,
primarily through professional associations but also through local
charitable organisations thereby boosting the attractiveness of
local areas and ecosystems.

Action to support resident populations and the local ecosystem
in Haute-Savoie

In order to promote regional development, Somfy participates in
and supports higher education and research establishments along
with the Haute-Savoie district. Somfy is a founding member of the
Fondation Université Savoie Mont Blanc (USMB) university
foundation and the Club des Entreprises de |’Université Savoie
Mont Blanc business club and works with the University to bring
together the academic and business worlds. Somfy also sits on the
Board of Directors of Polytech Annecy-Chambéry. In this way, the
University has representatives to facilitate job openings for its
students who are seeking skills training contracts and can also
identify new training requirements in the region, such as training
in Polytech Annecy-Chambéry’s “Data Usage Computing” which
meets the needs of the industry of the future and of Somfy today.
This policy promotes the emergence of pool of talents for the
company as can be seen in particular in Somfy’s presence at
“work-placement job dating” events and on work placement
events organised by the Business Club.

Somfy is heavily involved in competitiveness centres and
technology or methodology expertise clusters active in the Arve
Valley (Haute-Savoie), where the Group’s head office is located.
These organisations, boosted by the economic action of the
Auvergne-Rhéne-Alpes region, have more wide-ranging and
deeper effects thereby laying the ground for national or European
initiatives with selected partners in the future. Somfy is a member
of the governing Board of the CIMES Competitiveness Center and
chairs the organisation Thésame. These collaborations enable the
company to be committed to enhancing the attractiveness of the
local area whilst continuing to benefit from the input of skills and
innovations into its design and industrialisation processes. The
ecosystems that it includes also enable interaction and sharing
between all Somfy’s regional stakeholders: institutions,
associations, local suppliers and customers.

Lastly, Somfy is a sponsor of various initiatives in the Cluses and
Bonneville areas to ensure that local populations, employees living
near their place of work and their children can all see and benefit
from Somfy’s involvement locally. It involves supporting sports
clubs where children of local employees play (often shift workers).

Action to support top athletes

Somfy has been a partner of the French Ski Federation and the
French Biathlon Team since 2005, and all Nordic Skiing since 2014
(Biathlon, Cross Country, Ski Jumping, Nordic Combined). A
committed supporter of sporting initiatives for more than 20 years,
the Group also sponsors established and emerging athletes
individually: Anais Bescond, Clément Parisse, Antonin Guigonnat,
Julia Simon and Emilien Jacquelin.

For more than ten years, Somfy has been a partner of Martin
Fourcade, multiple Olympic medallist and 11-time world
champion. Martin Fourcade is a Somfy brand ambassador and
sponsor of the Les Petites Pierres Endowment Fund.

In 2019, Somfy supported three local ski clubs that provide
biathlon training to young people and enabled them to meet their
idols.

CONDITIONS FOR DIALOGUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS

A communication policy that is reviewed annually

The Group annually reviews its communication plan in relation to
its stakeholders, to ensure they are kept regularly informed and to
facilitate as much as possible constructive discussions in relation to
the Group’s strategy and management with the stakeholders
identified as priorities: employees, shareholders, investors,
customers, users, suppliers and regional governments.

Ongoing dialogue with public authorities

Involved in the development of the areas in which the Group is
located, Somfy has led dialogue in France with the various levels of
public decision-making to contribute to action in the areas of
education, employment, research and development, or to support
cultural and sporting projects for local people, by trying where
possible to relay these events within the company for the benefit
of employees. The cultural and sporting programmes include: Plein
Feux Festival (Bonneville), MB Race (Pays du Mont-Blanc) and the
centenary of Carpano & Pons (Cluses). This collaboration can take
the form of patronage or sponsorship.

It is within this context that in 2019, Somfy took responsibility as
leader in the Arve Valley region of the initiative “France, one
chance, companies commit!”, for the promotion of inclusion within
companies, thereby supporting a French government initiative,
covered by DIRECCTE (French Regional Department of Enterprise,
Competition, Consumer Affairs, Labour and Employment) and
Medef (French Business Confederation). The Minister of Labour,
Muriel Pénicaud, visited Somfy on this occasion and spoke with
stakeholders about this initiative in the Arve Valley region.

Somfy also sought to support Cluses council’s initiative to promote
Priority Neighbourhoods in the town’s policy and more generally
primary schools, by co-financing a string orchestra for the
neighbouring school, Laurent Molliex, in partnership with the
Cluses School of Music, as part of the national initiative, “An
Orchestra at School”.

Dialogue with customers and consumers

For several years, Somfy has been initiating a dialogue not only
with its customers but also with users of its products and
solutions. It is a promotional tool for the brand and a guarantee to
continue developing simple and useful products for the consumer.

Protection of user data and management of the digital risk

Somfy has introduced a comprehensive monitoring and employee
training policy to protect the company against malicious attacks on
its information systems or on the connected objects ecosystems
(objects, applications, servers). Each year, an audit plan is prepared
by professional experts for the two categories of digital risks
(information systems on the one hand and connected objects on
the other), presented and discussed with the heads of Internal
Audit and Risk Management. In addition to the training of
employees (programmer training is currently being developed),
this includes penetration tests carried out in accordance with
current standards.
Dialogue with users

Users are regularly consulted as part of the development of new
offers.

The My Somfy Lab platform allows studies to be conducted with
Internet users interested in the Somfy market without necessarily
being users of it brands. A part of the platform is closed to the
public and operates by invitation. 2,300 users and customers are
grouped into communities. 41 projects have been completed since
the launch of the platform in 2016. It covers three countries and
the feedback rate for surveys is 28%, which represents a high level
of engagement. In 2019, the open version accessible to all resulted
in 1,307 ideas and 6,092 answers to questionnaires for 14 projects,
an intense level of activity that included 2,151 comments and
more than 7,421 “Likes”.

In France, a forum moderated by Somfy gives the floor to
consumers. To date, more than 60,000 questions have been
posted there and the forum receives 160,000 unique monthly
visits. The 76,000 registered participants since the launch of the
forum in 2013 enables the hotline to be more efficient and to
answer calls more quickly. Similar initiatives exist in other
countries.

Somfy’s consumer information websites were used by 10,064,988
unique visitors in 2019.

Measuring customer satisfaction

Being responsive to professional customers is a priority for Somfy.
In 50 years, the Group has built a reputation for being close and
attentive to its customers. Within a relatively young market that is
growing and constantly changing, Somfy’s leadership and its desire
to be a trusted partner requires changing needs to be monitored.
For each customer profile, the Group has developed
dialogue-based activities — studies, surveys, training, services —
tailored to the needs of these stakeholders. Customer satisfaction
istracked | an international survey that assesses Somfy’s score in
terms of customers promoting the Somfy brand. This quality
survey shows that the Net Promoter Score was 68, which is a good
result and helps to identify areas for improvement.

PERFORMANCE OF THE ETHICAL APPROACH
AND THE ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY

COMMITMENT TO ETHICS AND COMBATTING CORRUPTION

Through the Ambition 2030strategic framework and_ its
sustainable development policy, Somfy is determined to
strengthen its stakeholders’ confidence in its ability to conduct its
business ethically. That is why the Group has made ethics a
cross-company focus of this policy. Risks related to non-ethical
behaviour and corruption within the company, and_ their
repercussions in terms of image and reputation as well as the
financial impacts, are taken all the more seriously by Somfy given
that the Group is committed to being the preferred partner for
window and door automation.

Business ethics and employee integrity are essential to preserving
Somfy’s image and reputation and protecting its staff. Employees
must comply with the laws and regulations in force within the
jurisdictions in which Somfy pursues its activities, as well as with
Somfy’s values and policies in terms of ethical principles. To do
this, Somfy promotes a strong ethical culture at every level of the
organisation.

The aim of this approach and policy is to strengthen the confidence
of stakeholders in the way in which Somfy pursues its international
development.

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD MANAGEMENT REPORT

ETHICAL ACTION PLAN

Since 2015, Somfy has had a Code of Ethics which is a point of
reference for employees in relation to individual and collective
behaviour, and a framework for everyday actions, enabling them
to embody the Group’s values. This Code is a common and unifying
document, which guides every employee in their decision-making;
it is also a tool to promote dialogue between employees so that
ethics is an open matter understood by all. It is systematically
provided to employee on joining the Group and is available on the
website in 23 languages.

Drivers of the Ethics function

The Supervisory and Management Boards provide strong support
to the Ethics Committee and oversee the ethics function.

The Ethics Committee is a structure that enables a collegiate vision
of ethics to be developed and rolled out and its application
monitored. It is made up of four members appointed by the
Management Board for a renewable term of office of three years,
as well as an Ethics Manager appointed from within its ranks to
lead both the system and the Committee.

The Ethics Committee relies on a network of Ethics officers to
oversee local communication and close coordination, ensuring the
solution’s effectiveness. The majority of these local officers are
members of the Human Resources community. As well as
providing coordination and support at local level, they are often
responsible for resolving difficulties locally. They help to provide
the most appropriate solutions to the questions asked by
employees on the ground.

The Managers are responsible for the roll-out and application of
the Code of Ethics within their scope, including in relation to new
arrivals.

Every employee must understand and apply the principles set out
in the Group’s Code of Ethics. They also all have a duty to
whistleblow if they become aware of any facts or practices that are
unethical. Employees are also encouraged to report any concerns
relating to ethical principles or behaviour to their manager, their
local Ethics officer, or the Ethics Committee.

The Ethics function also naturally has strong links with other
support functions. As such, the Head of Ethics has regular
interaction with the Legal, Internal Control and Risks, Internal
Audit, Sustainable Development and Environment, Corporate
Affairs, Finance, Safety, and Human Resources Departments, as
well as with all the Group’s Operational Departments.

Ethical reporting system

In addition to reporting direct exchanges, a whistleblowing system
allows anyone to report serious matters so that they can be taken
into consideration and treated in accordance with the applicable
legal and regulatory provisions. Included in the anti-corruption
compliance programme rolled out within the Group, this
whistleblowing mechanism also allows Somfy to meet the
requirements of law n°2016-1691 of 9December 2016 on
transparency, the fight against corruption and the modernisation
of the economy, known as the “Sapin 2 law” (hereafter the “law”).
The Group thus decided to introduce a unique mechanism to bring
itself into line with the requirements of this law.

This system complements the mechanism in force within the
Group since 2015 and which facilitates the confidential and safe
reporting of any behaviour in contravention of the Code of Ethics.
A specific procedure has been formally set out in 23 languages to
present this system and the conditions of its use. It is intended to
apply to all the Group’s entities, subject to its adaptation to
existing provisions under local legislation. A privacy policy relating

SOMPFY — ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019
04 MANAGEMENT BOARD MANAGEMENT REPORT

to the personal data processed as part of this mechanism is
provided to the individuals concerned.

The indicator used to monitor the performance of the ethics
mechanism is the number of ethics alerts reported to the Ethics
Committee, which was nine in 2019 (against 12 in 2018). However,
this slightly lower figure shows that the alert escalation system is
working well. Of the nine alerts received, eight were admissible, six
of which are closed at 31 December 2019.

Somfy is also a member of the Business Ethics Group, an
organisation that has set itself the task of promoting ethics and
compliance in the management and governance of French
companies. The Group’s Ethics Committee thus remains connected
with other professionals responsible for ethical issues within
companies and organisations.

ANTI-CORRUPTION PROGRAMME

In addition to the Group’s Ethics Code and following the
enactment of the law on transparency, the fight against corruption
and the modernisation of the economy, Somfy has implemented
an anti-corruption programme. In this way, the Group has formally
set out mapping dedicated to the analysis of corruption related
risks in each of its geographic regions, in accordance with its
activities. The Group also decided to adopt the Middlenext
Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct is designed
to guide business behaviour. Somfy supplemented it with several
appendices in order to provide practical advice, examples and links
to other procedures. In addition to these documents, e-learning
materials are currently being rolled out and face-to-face training
has also been introduced for those employees expected to be the
most exposed. The warning system introduced in 2015 to escalate
non-ethical behaviours (as mentioned above) was extended to
meet the requirements of the French “Sapin 2” anticorruption
legislation. Accounting controls were also implemented to detect
potential fraudulent acts. Lastly, procedures are currently being
rolled out to assess third parties with whom the Group already
works, and prior to any new relationship. A screening tool has also
been purchased in order to consult public databases reporting
potentially sensitive information about its partners. Validation
workflows are in the process of being configured and will allow the
assessments made and resultant decisions taken to be traced.

Several indicators are monitored, notably those relating to

training:
— in France, 1,251employees completed anti-corruption
e-learning training in 2019 within Somfy Activités SA,

representing 100% of the individuals concerned and employed
on the date of the campaign;

— in the Group’s other entities, 1,182 additional individuals
completed this same module in their native language,
representing 100% of the people concerned in deployed areas
and employed in the workforce on the dates of the local
campaigns;

— 646 people judged to be more exposed to the corruption risk
received face-to-face training, as well as 194 Directors, who are
members of the various Management Committees.

The roll-out of local training will continue in 2020.

As of 31 December 2019, neither Somfy nor any of its subsidiaries

had been found guilty of or were under investigation in relation to

corruption.

SOMPFY — ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019,

RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUBCONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS

Relationships with suppliers and subcontracting are important for
the Group due to the nature of its industrial activity which is
essentially assembly. The components of its products are all
purchased. Somfy is dedicated to ensuring the entire value chain is
involved in its commitment to corporate social responsibility. This
policy is reflected in the new contractual framework with a view to
deploying the Group’s CSR commitments in the upstream supply
chain: employment, the environment, fair practices and combating
corruption, conflict minerals and hazardous substances.

To respect its commitments, Somfy has launched a supplier

risk-management approach covering the following topics:

geopolitical risks and corruption, combating modern slavery,
environmental impacts of supplier processes and has mapped the
risks at between 1-low risk to 4-high risk.

Furthermore, in France, Somfy is a member of the organisation

Thésame, where it jointly finances a programme called PEAK which

develops collaborative and innovative approaches in relation to

the procurement function within a sector. Somfy has jointly
financed three dissertations on the subject.

The indicators monitored by Somfy regarding relationships with

subcontracting and suppliers are:

— the volume of purchases made locally, meaning within 500km of
the assembly site. In 2019, 45.9% of purchases met this
criterion;

— the number of suppliers covered by a supplier risk analysis. In
2019, the top five were audited, and in 2020 the top 40 should
be, and in 2021 the top 80.

For every component developed by a supplier, the Group requests

a written undertaking relating to the European Directives REACH

and ROHS. 100% of the top 80 suppliers (69% in the previous

report), representing 88% of purchasing amounts, comply with

REACH/ROHS requirements (results from the 2019 campaign).

In accordance with the regulations adopted by the US Securities

and Exchange Commission in 2012, the Group implemented its

duty of diligence in respect of its supply chain, in order to ensure
that the supplies used in its products do not contain any “Conflict

Minerals”. Of the nine suppliers affected by “conflict minerals”,

100% are compliant.

QUALITY CUSTOMS LABEL

Somfy is also an Authorised Economic Operator. This quality

customs label is internationally recognised (World Customs

Organisation). AEO programmes around the world have become

flagship Customs/Business Partnership programmes as they enable

customs to share their security responsibilities with the private

sector. This certification is subject to a very extensive audit not

only in terms of customs, but also in relation to safety and security

for compliance purposes. The terms and conditions related to this

certification cover a range of issues such as:

— compliance with regulations and notably in relation to previous
convictions;

— reliability of the company’s logistics and accounting system
(including audit trail);

— the company’s financial solvency;

— traceability of logistics flows;

— securing of business partners (customers, suppliers, service
providers, etc.);

— IT safety and security;

— overall compliance.

Being an AEO therefore means being an economic player

recognised as reliable by the European and global customs

authorities.
FIGHT AGAINST TAX EVASION

Somfy undertakes to observe the spirit and the letter of the law in
all countries in which it does business. It wants a frank and
transparent relationship with all tax authorities, seeks to clarify all
uncertainties and resolve all disputes in due course. It considers
that it pays its fair share of taxes in those countries in which it
operates.
Furthermore, the Group undertakes to pursue the following
actions in its drive for tax transparency and to combat tax evasion:
— participate in compulsory’ reporting such as_ the
Country-by-Country Reporting for France;
— monitor that intragroup transactions comply with arm’s length
principles and OECD actions on base erosion and profit shifting
(BEPS).

METHODOLOGY NOTE

The Non-Financial Performance Statement was drafted using the
reporting protocol introduced for the 2019 CSR reporting in
accordance with Article L. 225-102-1 of the Commercial Code.

REPORTING PROTOCOL

The Groups’ CSR reporting protocol is the reference guide for all
those involved in CSR reporting within the Group. It is drawn up in
French and English. Its purpose is to define all the Group’s CSR
indicators along with their method of calculation, and to describe
the procedures for their collection and for reporting in order to
promote the consistency and comparability of data. This document
is distributed to and applied at all levels of data reporting. The
reporting protocol is updated annually to take into account Group
developments.

The CSR reporting protocol also serves as a reference framework
for the external verification of data, in accordance with
Article L. 225-102-1 of the Commercial Code. It is available on
request from Head Office.

SELECTION OF INDICATORS

The Group’s indicators were defined by the CSR officers for each
area in line with the Group’s CSR strategy, the non-financial risks
identified and the resulting social, environmental, societal and
ethical objectives. They address the main challenges (risks and
opportunities) inherent in the Group’s activity and illustrate,
through clear communication, the Group’s non-financial
performance and the policies it has introduced to address these
challenges, while at the same time supporting the CSR approach in
each of the progress drivers identified by the Group.

COLLECTION, INTERNAL CONTROL AND CONSOLIDATION

The collection of CSR indicators is ensured by the CSR officers
within their respective fields of expertise. They rely on their
network of local experts who provide the data. The CSR officers are
also responsible for monitoring the consistency and plausibility of
the data prior to its consolidation in order to generate the Group
indicators included in the CSR section of the management report.

39

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD MANAGEMENT REPORT

REPORTING PERIOD

The data collected covers the period from 1 January to

31 December 2019.

Depending on the indicators, it can relate to:

— an annual consolidation of the data from 1 January 2019 to
31 December 2019;

— the data measured at 31 December 2019.

Where historical information is available, data is reported on the

last two financial years.

Unless otherwise specified, when 2019 and 2018 data are referred

to, it is on a comparable scope basis.

REPORTING SCOPE

Pursuant to Article L.225-102-1 of the Commercial Code,
companies which are controlled by the Group and_ fully
consolidated within the financial reporting scope are included
within the reporting scope. The concept of control means the
power to govern the financial and operational policies of an
affiliated company so as to benefit from its operations. Control is
generally deemed to exist where the Group holds more than half
of the controlled company’s voting rights.

For reasons of organisation and access to information, not all
Group companies have yet been included. The Group wants to use
perimeters that are more relevant depending on the topics
covered. As such, certain companies are excluded from the social
scope due to the existence of very low workforces in certain
organisations (distribution subsidiaries spread out over vast
geographic areas such as South America), or the lack of Human
Resources information systems designed for collecting data easily.
However, the Group integrates all significant companies that it
fully owns.

Newly acquired companies are integrated into the reporting scope
following a probationary period necessary for the introduction of
reporting. Companies which were sold during the financial year are
not included within the reporting scope.

As a follow-up to changes in control and governance at the Chinese
subsidiary Dooya, which has left the full consolidation scope and is
now consolidated using the equity method, Dooya is no longer part
of the CSR scope.

Specifics of the scope for 2019 reporting

The scope of analysis of the social data for the preparation of the
2019 CSR report was stable. It related to 41 Group companies and
a workforce at 31 December 2019 of 5,269 people, representing
92.3% of the Group’s total workforce.

These companies are spread across five continents, and
30 countries (South Africa, Germany, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Brazil, China, South Korea, Egypt, Spain, United States, France,
Greece, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Morocco, Norway, Netherlands,
Poland, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, United Kingdom,
Russia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunisia and Turkey).

METHODOLOGY LIMITATIONS

The methodologies used for the reporting of certain CSR indicators
may present limitations due to:

particularities of local legislation in the various countries in
which the Group is located;

lack of availability of information on certain scopes;

use of estimates in the absence of assessment tools;
practicalities of collecting and processing data.

(ARTICLE L. 225-100-1 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

Epidemiological risks (example: Covid-19) and their consequences
are not developed in this section but are not such as to change the

Group's risk information as described in the following
paragraphs”.
FINANCIAL RISKS

The main financial risks to which the Group is exposed are foreign
exchange, interest rate, liquidity, credit and raw material risks.
According to IFRS, all derivative financial instruments are
measured at their fair value. Fair value is either the market value
for listed instruments, or a value provided by financial institutions
in accordance with traditional criteria (over-the-counter market).
The amounts covered exclusively relate to current or future
transactions within the framework of the Group’s normal business
activities.

As part of the transposition of the MIF Directive that came into
force on 1 November 2007, Somfy SA and its French subsidiaries
opted for the “non-professional customers” category.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

Somfy’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily related to its
operational activities (intragroup sales of manufactured products
distributed by commercial subsidiaries outside the Euro zone,
these sales being denominated in local currencies and purchases
denominated in local currencies).

At comparable terms and conditions, the Group gives priority to
natural hedges (foreign currency purchases related to sales in the

~ “  |v(yu j}v fv Z] i

SOMPFY — ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019,

40

same currency). The derivative financial instruments put into place
are forward foreign exchange contracts for the main currencies.
The management of foreign exchange risk is covered in note 7.3 to
the consolidated financial statements.

INTEREST RATE RISK

The Group is exposed to interest rate risks. Management of the
interest rate relative to Group debt is based on consolidated
position and market conditions. The primary objective of the rate
risk management policy is to control Group financing costs.

The management of the interest rate risk is covered in note 7.3 to
the consolidated financial statements.

LIQUIDITY RISK

The Group must have permanent access to the necessary financial

resources to allow it to finance its day-to-day activities and its

investments. The Group’s liquidity risk primarily arises from the

obligation to repay its existing debt, the funding of its future

requirements and observance of its financial ratios.

The granting of credit facilities is subject to Somfy SA’s

commitments to its banking partners to comply with two types of

financial covenants based on:

— the Group’s financial structure (net financial debt/shareholder’s
equity); and

— its ability to repay (net financial debt/EBITDA).

The management of liquidity risk is covered in note 7.3 to the

consolidated financial statements.

Credit facilities and compliance with covenants are detailed in note

7.2.2.6 to the consolidated financial statements.
CREDIT RISK

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is related to its cash surplus
deposited with banks.

The management of credit risk is covered in note 7.3 to the
consolidated financial statements.

RAW MATERIAL RISK

The Group is exposed to fluctuations in the price of the raw
materials used in the manufacture of its products (copper and zinc
in particular).

To maintain its profitability, the Group must be able to cover for or
offset this risk or pass it on to its customers. It has, however,
introduced procedures designed to limit its exposure to risks
associated with changes in the prices of raw materials.

The management of raw material risk is covered in note 7.3 to the
consolidated financial statements.

EQUITY RISK

The Group is exposed to equity risk on treasury shares. Given the
share price, it was not necessary to record a provision for
writedown at 31 December 2019.

LEGAL RISKS

The Group’s operations are not subject to specific regulations. Its
activities do not require specific legal or regulatory authorisation.
The Group is involved in a number of disputes in respect of its
business. These should not have any significant negative impact on
the Group’s financial position.

To the Group’s knowledge, there were no exceptional events or
litigation likely to have a significant negative impact on the Group’s
or its subsidiaries’ operations, assets or results, other than those
mentioned in the highlights.

INSURANCE — RISK COVERAGE

The Group covers the main risks with the following insurance

policies:

— “Property damage”, covering buildings and their contents in all

locations (equipment, goods, IT equipment) as well as resulting
monetary and operational losses.
The events insured are, as a minimum, fire, explosions, lightning,
smoke, emissions, steam, impacts from airborne objects, vehicle
collisions, electrical risks, storms, hurricanes, cyclones, snow,
hail, water damage, frost, machine breakage, computer risks,
malicious acts, acts of vandalism, popular movements and IT
equipment theft, natural disasters, except where local
circumstances make this impossible;

— “General civil liability relating to monetary consequences of an
insured entity’s liability following physical injury, property
damage or moral prejudice caused to a third party during or in
relation to its operations”;

— “Corporate officers’ civil liability”;

— “Transported goods”.

In addition, credit insurance contracts, both in France and

internationally, mitigate the consequences of customer default.

Approximately 85% of sales are covered by such contracts.

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD MANAGEMENT REPORT

COUNTRY RISK

The country risk is analysed from two perspectives. The first
relates to the distribution activities most of which takes place in
safe regions such as Europe and the United States, as opposed to
regions that are the most exposed to economic, geopolitical and
monetary uncertainties like China, Latin America and the Middle
East which represent less than 10% of the Group’s sales. The
second perspective relates to the production and procurement
activities which are more exposed than the distribution activities,
since Somfy has production sites in Tunisia and China, and a large
proportion of its suppliers of components have close connections
with Asia, and more specifically China. In relation to this second
perspective, given the level of risk, business continuity plans have
been developed in order to reduce and control this risk.

The Group was not adversely affected by Brexit in 2019 and does
not expect to be in 2020.

FINANCIAL RISKS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EFFECTS OF
CLIMATE CHANGE AND A LOW-CARBON STRATEGY

Somfy’s activity is partly focused on exterior (motorisation of
shutters and patio awnings) and interior (motorisation of curtains
and blinds) sun protection. Weather conditions have an impact on
both the volume of products sold and on their installation, in
particular over the first half-year, during which sales of
motorisations for awnings are concentrated.

As part of its industrial activities, the Group is exposed to a certain
number of risks attributable to climate conditions (storms,
earthquakes, floods, etc.) and therefore, more generally, to
climate change. The Group has introduced a risk assessment for
this and has the insurance it needs to protect it from any financial
consequences.

The fight against climate change has been taken into account in
the design of its products through its Act for Green’ programme.
The Group is also working on optimising the use of raw materials,
energy efficiency and recyclability to reduce the carbon footprint
of its products. In relation to risk assessments linked to climate
change and actions introduced by the Group to mitigate them as
part of its environmental approach, see section “Non-Financial
Performance Statement”, paragraph “Environmental Policy
Performance” of this report.

CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK

Customer credit risk is linked to the receivables portfolio and the
sometimes challenging economic environment in certain parts of
the world. Nevertheless, customer profile, the Group’s
international geographic presence and the credit insurance cover
help to mitigate this risk.

The management of credit risk is covered in note 4.5 to the
consolidated financial statements.

NON-FINANCIAL RISKS

Non-financial risks are covered in the Non-financial Performance
Statement (page 25).

DESCRIPTION OF INTERNAL CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS
PROCEDURES RELATIVE TO THE PREPARATION AND PROCESSING
OF FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION

(ARTICLE L. 225-100-1 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

STRATEGIC, BUDGETARY AND REPORTING
PROCESSES

The preparation of the budget is part of an annual strategic
process involving all the Activities, Business Areas and Business
Units, as well as all the Divisions, which define their own key
objectives, in line with the strategic guidelines set by General
Management.
The overall budget is prepared as part of an iterative process
involving all Group players. It is the result of the consolidation of
local budgets.
After approval by the General Management of the Group, every
manager becomes responsible for meeting his/her own budget.
The measurement of the achievement of objectives set out in the
budgets is carried out through a system of matrix reporting on a
monthly and quarterly basis, which enables results to be produced
on several axes (Business Area, Business Unit and Activity). It
comprises the standard financial data: operating accounts and
balance sheet indicators, and non-financial performance
indicators.
Reporting is complemented by strategic reports and quarterly
updates of forecast sales and profit for the current year. These
measurements enable a follow-up of the achievement of
objectives and provide corrective actions on a matrix basis and at
all levels of responsibility (consolidation, Business Areas, Business
Units, Activities, Legal Companies, Departments and Services).
In addition, three three-year plans, in line with Group strategy and
revised annually, are overseen by Management. They include:
— a PSMP (Products and Solutions Master Plan) which relates to
the development of the range of products and solutions;
— an industrial and logistics master plan for production facilities;
— amaster plan for information systems.

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Group has defined a unique and common framework for the
recording of accounting and financial information.

It resulted in the definition and implementation within all
subsidiaries of a Group chart of accounts, as well as the definition
and implementation of the main management procedures
(inventories, non-current assets, trade receivables, etc.), which are
formalised in the Group Procedure Manual relayed through and
updated on the Group’s intranet.

The proper application of the chart of accounts, procedures and
reporting reliability is monitored by visits to subsidiaries, planned
within the context of year-end and half-year closing. It is also
verified during the budget preparation and monthly reporting
processes.

The Group team responsible for the development and control of
financial statements comprises:

— the consolidation team;

— the central financial control team.

This team relies on financial controllers, based in each Business
Area, reporting to the Group in its ten geographical areas.

SOMPFY — ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019,

42

In addition, each of the Activities benefits from at least one
dedicated financial controller.

The Group endeavours to lead this network J] international
meetings and on-going training of accountants and _ financial
controllers.

Particular care is taken with risk analysis, through a review of asset
provisions and provisions for liabilities and charges, as well as
off-balance sheet commitments.

At each year-end, inventories are verified either through a
complete physical stock-take or by a rolling physical stocktaking
procedure.

Trade receivables are the subject of credit risk analyses with
respect to the measurement of provisions. In addition, the
company hedges the majority of its risk by entering into customer
credit insurance contracts, both in France and abroad.

Intragroup purchases, sales and balance sheet items are confirmed
monthly.

Inventory amounts originating from the Group are determined in
all entities in order to eliminate internal profit margins on
inventories.

A pre-closing meeting is organised each half-year with the Legal
Department to identify all liabilities and possible or stated
litigation and to calculate, with reference to the progress of cases,
corresponding provisions for liabilities and charges.

The review of various contracts, deposits, sureties and guarantees
also serves to identify off-balance sheet commitments.

The consolidation packages, including: balance sheet, income
statement, cash flow tables and related data, are then sent to the
Consolidation Department according to a predefined planning
schedule.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTROL

The Consolidation Department, after verifying the completeness of
financial information, the proper application of closing procedures
and restatements, performing the intragroup account
reconciliations and verifying the net equity justification, performs
financial statement consolidation using dedicated software.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with IFRS. In addition, accounting options selected are presented
to and approved by the Audit Committee.

FINANCIAL COMMUNICATION

Following their approval by the Supervisory Board, the half-year
and full-year financial statements are presented to the financial
community under the auspices of the SFAF (French financial
analyst society) and published in a report posted on the financial
issuer’s website (www.somfyfinance.com) as well as | a primary
information provider (www.lesechos-comfi.fr).

The other regulated information referred to in Article 221-1 of the
AMF’s general regulations is also available on both these sites.
Relevant information relating to the company’s business activities
is presented to the Audit Committee.
IT SYSTEMS

The BaaN integrated management package is installed in most
distribution subsidiaries, excluding Asia, where ERP Accpac has
been rolled out in the majority of cases.

For the companies that have an ERP (BaaN or Accpac) installed,
standard parameters are included (comprising a chart of accounts,
analytical follow-up and procedures).

The new ERP chosen by the Group will be gradually rolled out
starting from 2020.

Completion of the budget, monthly reporting, margin analysis by
product family and legal consolidation are all carried out on the
same platform (Hyperion), which improves uniformity and
facilitates the analysis of information.

TREASURY COMMITTEE/GROUP CASH
MANAGEMENT

The Group Treasury Department reports to the member of the

Management Board and Chief Financial Officer.

The Group Treasury Department is responsible for carrying out

transactions in cash management, financing and managing risks of

a financial or banking nature, and providing technical support to

subsidiaries’ cross-company functions, in connection with the

Group’s operations.

It has a duty to warn the member of the Management Board and

Chief Financial Officer, the Treasury Committee or the

Management Board of developments in the relevant markets and

the fair assessment of risks.

A Treasury Committee meeting is held each month, chaired by the

Group’s Treasurer, to review:

— deposits;

— funding;

— the Group’s net debt;

— off-balance sheet banking commitments;

— foreign exchange positions;

— amacroeconomic review of the market;

— the Group’s cash and debt positions (current and forecast);

— miscellaneous items: ongoing acquisitions, follow up of late
payments, guaranties/securities, Group loans;

— miscellaneous projects (netting, optimisation of cash
management systems, securing the management of banking
powers...);

— the Group’s net financial income/(expense) (twice annually).

This Committee comprises the following members:

— the member of the Management Board and Chief Financial
Officer;

— the Group Treasurer;

— the Group Head of Consolidation.

Members of the Management Board are ~r }(( ]mémbers and

have a standing invitation to Committee meetings.

The role of the Treasury Committee is twofold:

— strategic: to define the overall policy in terms of Group Cash
Management, financing, and interest rate, exchange rate and
investment risk management. They also include the follow-up of
Group subsidiaries’ equity balance sheet items;

— operational: to guarantee the regular monitoring of Group Cash
Management’s actions. These are detailed in a monthly trend
chart.

The rules and procedures relating to the Group’s Cash

Management have been formalised in the Cash Management

Charter, which covers the following:

— ethics;

43

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD MANAGEMENT REPORT

— liquidity/exchange rate/interest rate risk;

— deposit of excess cash;

— counterparty risk;

— governance.

This Charter was subject to a quality review in 2019.

In addition, a Group Treasury Charter has been in place since
1 November 2013. It defines best practices and list in a single
document the guidelines that ensure the secure, economical and
efficient management of financing and deposit operations, and
more generally of cash management and bank relations within the
Group.

This Group Treasury Charter is applicable to all subsidiaries
controlled directly or indirectly by Somfy SA and specifies their
roles and responsibilities regarding the management of their
financing, deposits, banking flows and more broadly speaking their
cash management transactions.

INTERNAL CONTROL MONITORING

The Internal Control Department reports to the member of the
Management Board and Chief Financial Officer. The Department is
made up of the Head of Internal Control, a long-term trainee and
representatives responsible for leading internal control at local
level.

The internal control function coordinates management actions,

ensuring the following:

— compliance with laws and regulations;

— the application of the instructions and guidelines set by the
Management Board;

— the smooth running of the Group’s processes and operations,
notably those that help safeguard its assets and prevent fraud;

— the reliability of reporting (both financial and non-financial).

Members of the Internal Control Committee meet once every two

months to discuss the latest audit reports issued and other

matters, such as year-end visits or training programmes to be
provided to financial controllers, or ongoing projects.

In order to fulfil its coordinating and monitoring role, the

Department implemented a dedicated GRC tool (Governance, Risks

& Compliance), specifically:

— to initiate a self-assessment campaign for subsidiaries each year,
including a framework of key controls;

— to monitor all the tasks of Internal Audit, as well as the related
recommendations and the corresponding action plans;

— to assess the Group’s risks, at several levels (BU, BA/BG,
BMA/Activities), to consolidate the results at Group level and to
link them with action plans.

The use of all these resources is closely monitored by the Audit

Committee, which is regularly informed of the progress achieved

and the results obtained.

A quarterly reporting process has also been established for the

benefit of the Group Executive Committee and the managers of all

subsidiaries in relation to the progress of action plans and the
resolution of weaknesses that have been identified.

Certain improvements are directly addressed by entities at a local

level, while others are looked into centrally by the Internal Control

Department and/or in collaboration with other cross-Group

functions.

Lastly, the Internal Control Department is also responsible for the

centralised monitoring of risks and the update of risk mapping, in

collaboration with the Internal Audit Department specifically in
relation to the methodology.

AUTHORISATION TO BE GRANTED TO THE
MANAGEMENT BOARD FOR THE BUYBACK

BY THE COMPANY OF ITS OWN SHARES PURSUANT
TO ARTICLE L. 225-209 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE,
DURATION OF THE AUTHORISATION, OBJECTIVES,
TERMS AND CONDITIONS, CAP (resolution 15)

A share buyback plan for a period of 18 months will be submitted
for your approval. This plan would replace the current programme,
which would be terminated early. It would allow management to
purchase up to 10% of the shares of the company, if necessary
restated for any potential capital increase or decrease transactions
that may be carried out over the timeframe of the programme.

This authorisation would supersede the authorisation granted to

the Management Board by the 11™ resolution to the General

Meeting of 22 May 2019, sitting in ordinary session.

The objectives of this programme would be:

— to stimulate the secondary market or ensure the liquidity of the
Somfy share, by way of an investment services provider within a
liquidity contract that complies with practices recognised by
regulations, it being specified that within this framework the
number of shares considered for the calculation of the limit
specified above corresponds to the number of shares purchased
less the number of shares resold;

— to retain the shares purchased and subsequently exchange them
or use them as payment within the framework of potential
acquisitions;

— to ensure the coverage of stock option plans and/or free share
allocation plans (or similar) granted to employees and/or
corporate officers of the Group, as well as all other shares
allocated under a company or group savings scheme (or similar),
in relation to employee profit-sharing and/or any other form of
allocation to employees and/or corporate officers of the Group;

— to cover marketable securities giving right to the allocation of
company shares, in accordance with applicable regulations;

— to proceed with the possible cancellation of shares acquired, in
accordance with the authorisation granted or to be granted by
the Extraordinary General Meeting.

Such share purchases could be effected by all means, including by

means of acquiring blocks of shares and at any times considered

appropriate by the Management Board.

The company would reserve the right to use options or derivative

instruments, in accordance with applicable regulations.

We propose to set the maximum purchase price at €170 per share.

The maximum value of the transaction, taking account of the

2,616,647 treasury shares held at 31 December 2019, is therefore

set at €184,170,010.
AUTHORISATION TO BE GRANTED TO THE
MANAGEMENT BOARD TO CANCEL SHARES BOUGHT
BACK BY THE COMPANY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK
SET OUT BY ARTICLE L. 225-209 OF THE
COMMERCIAL CODE (resolution 16)

1) to cancel the shares bought back by the company under the
mechanism of Article L. 225-209 of the Commercial Code, at its
own discretion, on one or more occasions, within a limit of
10% of capital, calculated on the day on which the cancellation
decision is made, reduced by the number of shares cancelled
during the previous 24 months, the shares which the company
holds or could hold following share buybacks exercised within
the framework of Article L. 225-209 of the Commercial Code as
well as to reduce share capital by the corresponding amount
pursuant to the legal and regulatory provisions in force;

to set the term of this authorisation at 24 months starting from
the General Meeting of 13 May 2020",

to grant the Management Board all powers required to carry
out all necessary transactions for such cancellations and
ancillary reductions of share capital, to modify the company’s
