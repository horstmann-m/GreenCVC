Our history

On December 7, 2010, the Board of Directors of Aperam and the Board of Directors of ArcelorMittal approved
a proposal to its shareholders to spin-off ArcelorMittal’s stainless and specialty steels businesses. The
objective of establishing an independent company was to enable the stainless and specialty steels businesses
to benefit from better market visibility by pursuing a growth strategy focused on emerging markets and
specialty products, including electrical steel. On January 25, 2011, at an extraordinary general meeting, the
shareholders of ArcelorMittal voted to approve the spin-off proposal.

The main shareholder ("Significant Shareholder") holds 40.94% of the voting rights. Please refer to the share
capital section of this Management Report for the definition of the term "Significant shareholder".

Our operational organisation and facilities

We manage our business according to three primary operating segments:

+ Stainless & Electrical Steel. We are a leading global producer of stainless steel by production capacity. We
produce a wide range of stainless and electrical steels (both Grain Oriented and Non-Grain Oriented) and
continuously expand our product offerings by developing new and higher grades of stainless steel and
electrical steel. The Stainless & Electrical Steel segment includes Aperam’s Stainless Precision business
and Aperam BioEnergia, which produces wood and charcoal (biomass) from cultivated eucalyptus forests.
We use the charcoal (biomass) produced by Aperam BioEnergia as a substitute for coke at our Timdteo
production facility.

This segment accounted for 45.8% of external sales and 80.8% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31,
2020, and 45.8% of external sales and 77.0% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2019.

+ Services & Solutions. Our Services & Solutions segment, which includes our tubes business, performs
three core activities: (i) the management of exclusive direct sales of stainless steel products from our
production facilities, primarily those located in Europe; (ii) distribution of our products and, to a much lesser
extent, external suppliers’ products; and (iii) transformation services, which include the provision of value
added and customised steel solutions through further processing to meet specific customer requirements.

This segment accounted for 40.2% of external sales and 11.4% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31,
2020, and 40.2% of external sales and 12.9% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2019.

+ Alloys & Specialties. Our Alloys & Specialties segment is the fourth largest producer of specialty alloys in
the world. We specialise in the design, production and transformation of various specialty alloys and
certain specific stainless steels. Our products take the form of bars, semis, cold-rolled strips, wire and wire
rods, and plates and are offered in a wide range of grades.

This segment accounted for 14.0% of external sales and 13.1% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31,
2020, and 14.0% of external sales and 14.0% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2019.

Additionally, we have EBITDA that is reported within our "Others and Eliminations" segment. This segment,
including corporate costs and elimination between our primary operating segments, accounted for (5.2)% of
EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2020, and (3.9)% of EBITDA for the year ending December 31,
2019.

Europe

Our European facilities produce the full range of our stainless steel products. In 2020, steel shipments from
Stainless & Electrical Steel Europe facilities represented 1,048 thousand tonnes (compared to 1,113 thousand
tonnes in 2019).

We have two melt shops in Belgium, located in Genk and Chatelet. The Genk facility includes two electric arc
furnaces, argon-oxygen decarburization equipment, ladle refining metallurgy, a slab continuous caster and
slab grinders. It also includes a cold rolling mill facility. The Chatelet location is an integrated facility with a
meltshop and a hot rolling mill. The Chatelet melt shop includes an electric arc furnace, argon-oxygen
decarburization equipment, ladle furnaces refining metallurgy, a slab continuous caster and slab grinders.

Our cold rolling facilities in Europe consist of four cold rolling mill plants, located in Belgium (Genk) and
France (Gueugnon, Isbergues and Pont-de-Roide). Our plants include annealing and pickling lines (with shot
blasting and pickling equipment), cold rolling mills, bright annealing lines (in Gueugnon and Genk), skin-pass
and finishing operations equipment. The Isbergues plant also includes a Direct Rolling, Annealing and Pickling
(“DRAP”) line. The Genk plant is focused on austenitic steel products, the Gueugnon plant on ferritic products,
and the Isbergues plant on products dedicated to the automotive (mainly ferritic steels) and industrial markets
(mainly austenitic steels). The Pont-de-Roide plant is focused on narrow precision strips. Recyco, our electric
arc furnace recycling facility located in France (Isbergues), retrieves dust and sludges with the aim of
recycling stainless steel raw materials and reducing waste.

South America

We are the only producer of flat stainless and electrical steel in South America. Our integrated production
facility in Timdteo, Brazil, produces a wide range of stainless, electrical steel and special carbon products,
which account for approximately 35% of the Stainless & Electrical Steel operating segment's total shipments.
Steel shipments from Stainless & Electrical Steel Brazil facilities represented 591 thousand tonnes in 2020
and 609 thousand tonnes in 2019.

The Timoteo integrated production facility includes two blast furnaces, one melting shop area (including two
electrical furnaces, two converters and two continuous casting machines), one hot rolling mill (including one
walking beam and one pusher furnace with one rougher mill and one steckel mill), a stainless cold rolling shop
(including one hot annealing and pickling line, two cold annealing and pickling lines, one cold preparation line,
three cold rolling mills and four batch annealing furnaces) and an electrical steel cold rolling shop (including
one hot annealing and pickling line, two tandem annealing lines, one decarburising line, one thermo-flattening
and carlite coating line, one cold rolling mill and 20 batch annealing furnaces). Aperam South America also
has a unique capability to produce stainless and specialty steel from low cost biomass (charcoal) produced by
Aperam BioEnergia with the wood from its eucalyptus forests.

Aperam BioEnergia

The charcoal produced at BioEnergia is used in our steel-making process as a natural and renewable
substitute for fossil fuels (coke). This allows us to entirely eradicate the use of extractive coke and makes our
steel a leader in terms of CO, footprint. Our forest is continuously cultivated and maintained and is actually
carbon positive, which means it is acting as a carbon sink. This is why our BioEnergia unit is a source of pride
for our teams, who are keen to promote our products with ‘green’ labels.

Our forest management is based on best practices and is recognized by the Forest Stewardship Council®’s
(FSC®) certification, whose standards and principles conciliate ecological protection (flora and fauna, but also
water reserves) with social benefits and economic feasibility.

Our carbonization process is realised without any extractive fuels and with extraordinary energy efficiency,
reusing the heat and gases generated by incineration to dry the wood. Thanks to this responsible process and
sustainable, all the charcoal is produced efficiently and is sent to the furnaces of the Aperam Brazilian steel
plant, located in the same state, in the city of Timdteo, some 350 kilometres away.

Services & Solutions

We sell and distribute our products through our Services & Solutions segment, which includes our tubes
business. The segment also provides value added and customised steel solutions through further processing
to meet specific customer requirements. Our distribution network is comprised of 14 steel service centres, 5
transformation facilities and 17 sales offices. Steel shipments from the Services and Solutions division
represented 646 thousand tonnes in 2020 and 706 thousand tonnes in 2019.

Market analysis

Market environment

Our operational results are primarily affected by external factors that impact the stainless and specialty steel
industry in general and, in particular, stainless and electrical steel pricing, demand for stainless and specialty
steels, production capacity, trends in raw material, energy prices, and fluctuations in exchange rates. In
addition to these external factors, our operational results are affected by certain factors specific to Aperam,
including several initiatives we introduced in response to the challenging economic environment. These
factors are described in greater detail below.

Stainless steel pricing

The stainless steel market is a global market. Stainless steel is suitable for transport over long distances, as
logistics costs represent a small proportion of overall costs. As a result, prices for commoditised stainless
steel products evolve similarly across regions. However, in general, stainless steel products are not
completely fungible due to wide variations in shape, chemical composition, quality, specifications and
application, availability of local raw material and purchase conditions - all of which impact sales prices.
Accordingly, there remains a limited market for uniform pricing or exchange trading of certain stainless steel
products.

Stainless steel is a steel alloy with a minimum of 10.5% chromium content by mass and a combination of
alloys that are added to confer certain specific properties depending on the application. The cost of alloys
used in stainless steel products varies across products and can fluctuate significantly. Prices of stainless steel
in Europe and the United States are concluded as either fixed prices or generally include two components :

> the "base price", which is negotiated with customers and depends on market supply and demand; and

> the "alloy surcharge", which is a supplementary charge to the selling price of steel that offsets the
purchase price increases in raw materials, such as nickel, chromium or molybdenum, by directly
passing these increases onto customers. The concept of the "alloy surcharge", which is calculated
using raw material purchase prices, among which some are quoted on certain accepted exchanges
like the London Metals Exchange (LME), was introduced in Europe and the United States in response
to significant volatility in the price of these materials.

Notwithstanding the application of the "alloy surcharge", the Group is still affected by changes in raw material
prices. This is particularly true for nickel, which in the last decade experienced some sudden spikes, before
coming back to a lower level. In general, when the price of nickel is falling, purchasers delay ordering
stainless steel products in order to benefit from expected price decreases. This in turn has the effect of
reducing demand in the short term. By contrast, when nickel prices are rising, purchasers tend to acquire
larger quantities of stainless steel in order to avoid having to buy at higher prices.

During the 1st half of year 2020, stainless steel prices have been negatively affected by several factors. The
COVID-19 induced crisis has led to a collapse of demand _ in China in Q1 2020, and consecutively in Europe
and in the Unites States of America in Q2 2020 with consumption and production basically on halt. While it
was also hit by the COVID-19 induced crisis, Brazil reacted relatively better from a macroeconomic
perspective compared to Europe and the USA. The COVID-19 pandemic has occurred at a moment where
consumption was weak due to the automotive industry slowdown, and the economic growth stagnation in
Europe and had negative repercussions on stainless-intensive markets such as capital goods, electronic/
household appliances and architecture, building and construction. At the same time, Indonesia’s upstream
stainless steel production capacity expansion kept pricing on the export market under strong pressure, despite
the quota system put in place by the EU to tackle imports of hot rolled coils from Indonesia and cold rolled
coils from Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. The coupling of these negative factors has

put strong pressure on the international stainless steel pricing, and European prices reached historical lows in
May-June 2020.

The prices of electrical steels for Grain Oriented (GO) and Non Grain Oriented steels (NGO) were negatively
affected by lower demand due to COVID-19 induced crisis in the first half of 2020. In the second half of 2020,

18


--- Page 9 ---

Annual Report 2020

prices were positively supported by the rebuilding of inventories, increased demand and improved electrical
steel utilization rates.

Demand for stainless and electrical steel and
specialty alloys products

Demand for stainless and electrical steel, which represents approximately 2.5% of the global steel market by
volume, is affected to a significant degree by trends in the global economy and industrial production. Short-
term demand is also affected by fluctuations in nickel prices, as discussed in greater detail in the "Stainless
Steel Pricing" section above.

In 2020, global demand for stainless steel flat products was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 induced
crisis. Consumption was down 12% in Europe and in Brazil, and decreased by 11% in the USA. China is the
only main country where demand continued to grow, albeit by a mere 1%. (Data source: CRU, cold-rolled
stainless steel apparent consumption).

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 induced crisis, the specialty alloys market suffered from an estimated 20%
decline primarily due to weaker end markets in the aerospace, automotive, and Oil & Gas sectors. The
relative stability in power generation, LNG tankers or, to a lower extent, gas pipelines, could not fully
compensate the excess supply due to the decline in the above mentioned end-markets. In this uncertain
business environment, certain projects have either been cancelled or postponed, especially in the long
products alloys segment, but on the upside, long-term technological changes are driving and boosting new
applications for Aperam’s specialty alloys products in electronics, e-mobility or green energy.

Production and capacity

Compared to 2019, the cold-rolled stainless steel production in 2020 decreased by 12% in Brazil, by 11% in
the USA, and by 9% in Europe as demand was negatively impacted by the pandemic situation. Only China
showed still a positive trend, with +1% compared to 2019.

The global structural overcapacity is estimated to have grown due to additional capacity added by China,
where cold rolled overcapacity increased to 3.4 million tonnes, and by Indonesia, whose stainless slab
overcapacity doubled to more than 1.2 million tonnes.

Considering the steady increase of stainless steel capacity in Indonesia, and China not taking sufficient
measures to address its own overcapacity issue, it is unlikely that noticeable overcapacity reductions will take
place in the near future, thus keeping under pressure the global stainless value chain and trade flows.

Due to ineffective safeguard measures in Europe, imports from Asia remained significantly high in Europe
during the entire year 2020, thus exacerbating the pressure on domestic producers whose market had already
been heavily impacted by COVID-19-induced demand crisis.

Competition

Aperam is a leading flat stainless steel producer in South America, the second largest producer in Europe and
one of the top ten flat stainless steel producers in the world.

Aperam’s main competitors in Europe are Outokumpu, Acerinox and Thyssenkrupp Acciai Speciali Terni
S.P.A. Globally, the competitive landscape has transformed over the past years, with Chinese producers
Tsingshan, TISCO, BaoWu (formerly known as Baosteel) and Beihai Chengde now ranking among the 10
largest global flat stainless steel producers in the world.

While it was also hit by the COVID-19 induced crisis, Brazil reacted relatively better from a macroeconomic
perspective compared to Europe and the USA. As a consequence, despite also showing a negative
performance for 2020, the prices and the volumes have been relatively good, with a healthy recovery of prices
in the second half of the year.

Developments regarding trade measures

2019 and 2020 were marked by extensive developments in respect to trade measures, as described in
greater detail below.

Safeguard quotas are excessively generous. AD is effective in levelling playing field

1. Safeguard measures on import of steel products

On February 1, 2019, the European Commission published a regulation imposing definitive safeguard
measures on the import of steel products, following the 200 day period of the application of the provisional
measures. These measures took effect on February 2, 2019, expiring on July 30, 2021.

Definitive safeguard measures take the form of a tariff-rate quota in order to prevent serious injury, but at the
same time preserve traditional trade flows as much as possible. This level of tariff-rate quota is set at the
average level of imports over the 2015-2017 period plus 5%. Quotas are to be further adjusted, increasing the
level of the free-of-duty quota by 3% after each year, specifically on July 1, 2019 and July 1, 2020. The
additional duties to be paid above the quota are 25%.

20


--- Page 11 ---

Annual Report 2020

A mixed approach has been put in place. A country-specific tariff-rate quota is allocated to countries having a
significant supply interest, based on their imports over the last three years. A global tariff-rate quota (the
residual quota) based on the average of the remaining imports over the last three years is allocated to all
other supplying countries. This residual tariff-rate quota is divided quarterly. Unused quarterly tariff-rate quota
allocations will be automatically transferred to the next quarter, during the same period.

When a supplying country has exhausted its specific tariff-rate quota, it is given access to the residual tariff-
rate quota. However, this possibility is only applied during the last quarter of the period.

Products originating in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are not subject to the measures and, according to
WTO rules, products originating from developing countries below 3% of total imports in the period July 2017 —
June 2018 are not subject to the measures.

Furthermore, in order to comply with bilateral obligations, certain countries with which the European Union
has signed an Economic Partnership Agreement will also be excluded from the application of this Regulation
(this includes, for instance, South Africa).

On May 17, 2019, the European Commission announced the initiation concerning the review of safeguard
measures applicable to imports of steel products.

On September 27, 2019, the European Commission published its decision to adopt the adjustments to the
steel safeguard measures, taking effect as from October 1, 2019.

With the first review in the summer of last year, the EC introduced a 3% annual increase in tariff-free steel
quotas across all product categories, a cut from the original 5% annual increase and reviewed the list of
exclusions for developing countries on the basis of statistics of 2018 full year.

Imports from Indonesia (both stainless steel cold rolled and stainless steel hot rolled products) were included
in the scope, falling into the residual quota,

For further details please refer to the following link:

Link to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1590 of 26 September 2019 amending Implementing Regulation
(EU) 2019/159 imposing definitive safeguard measures against imports of certain steel products

On February 14, 2020, the European Commission announced the initiation concerning the second review of
safeguard measures applicable to imports of steel products.

On June 30, 2020, the European Commission published its decision to adopt the adjustments to the steel
safeguard measures, taking effect as from July 1, 2020.

The main adopted adjustments to the existing steel safeguard measures are the following, trying to better
reflect the current situation in the steel sector:

1) The 3% liberalization still remained in place.

2) Quarterly administration of all country-specific quota (but no elimination of unused quarterly quota carry-
over)

3) Adjustment to the access regime to the residual quota in the fourth quarter of the last period (the last
period runs from 1st July 2020 to 30th June 2021; Q2-2021 represents the last quarter of the period):

- Prohibited access: organic coated, wire rod, cold finished bars
- Limited access: stainless plate, merchant bars, rebar, stainless bars, stainless wire rod

- Unlimited access: all other categories. However the access to the last-quarter residual quotas is now
limited to the initially available quota volumes (carried over volumes NOT included).

21

Annual Report 2020

4) The list of developing countries excluded from the measures was updated on the basis of the most
recent stable statistical data (2019), but there were no changes for Stainless Steel categories.

Some relevant changes for stainless steel products need to be underlined:
1) For Stainless Steel Cold Rolled Product Category there is a quarterly administration of all country-
specific quota, with an unlimited access to the last-quarter residual quota; however the access is now

limited to the initially available quota volumes (carried over volumes NOT included).

2) For Stainless Hot-Rolled Sheets And Strips Product Category, country quota system has turned into a
global Tariff Rate Quota administered on a quarterly basis

https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32020R0894&from=EN

On October 30, 2020 the European Commission published in the Official Journal the "Notice concerning the
adaptation of the level of Tariff Rate Quotas under the safeguard measures on certain steel products following
the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union as of 1 January 2021".

On December 10, 2020, the European Commission published the Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/2037
amending Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/159 imposing definitive safeguard measures against imports of
certain steel products.

All quotas have been recalculated (including countries eligible to national quota >5% import share and
developing countries >3%), this time with regard to EU27. The reference period is the same as the one in the
original investigation (i.e. 2015-2017). The new tariff-rate quota will apply in Q1 and Q2 2021.

Some relevant changes for stainless steel products need to be underlined:
1) For Stainless Steel Cold Rolled Product Category overall quotas are slightly lower, around 3,000 tonnes
per quarter. Vietnam recalculated import share is now 4.8% and therefore Vietnam is no longer eligible

to have a national quota. As such its volumes are now falling into the residual quota (residual quota will
be around 47,000 tonnes per quarter).

2) For Stainless Hot-Rolled Sheets and Strips Product Category, global quotas are slightly higher, around
1,000 tonnes per quarter (removed imports in UK from third countries but added EU imports from Uk).

For further details please refer to the following link:

https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:JOC 2020 366 R_0012&from=ENhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/

Anti-dumping measures on cold rolled stainless steel originating in China and Taiwan continued after the
imposition of provisional safeguard and definitive measures.

Once the quota is filled, to avoid the imposition of double remedies, the highest level of safeguard or the
following anti-dumping duties are to be applied:

2. Expiry review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of stainless steel cold-rolled flat
products originating in the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan

On August 25, 2020, the European Commission published in the Official Journal the “Notice of initiation of an
expiry review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of stainless steel cold-rolled flat products
originating in the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan”.

The request for an expiry review was lodged by the European steel association Eurofer on May 27 of the
same year.

7. WTO challenge against Indonesian restrictions on raw materials

On November 22, 2019, the European Union brought a dispute in the World Trade Organization (WTO)
against Indonesian export restrictions for raw materials used in production of stainless steel.

These restrictions unfairly limit access of international producers to raw materials for steel production, notably
nickel.

The European Union is also challenging subsidies that encourage use of local content by Indonesian
producers and give preference to domestic over imported goods, which goes against WTO rules.

For further details please refer to the following link:

https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2019/november/tradoc_158450.pdf

On January 14, 2021, the European Union “has requested the establishment of a panel at the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to seek the elimination of unlawful export restrictions imposed by Indonesia on raw
materials necessary for the production of stainless steel, notably nickel ore and iron ore”.

“The measures the European Union is challenging concern an export ban on nickel ore and domestic

processing requirements on nickel ore and iron ore. These measures illegally restrict access for European
Union steel producers to raw materials needed for stainless steel production”.

The above graph shows the evolution of stainless steel imports into Europe. Anti dumping duties on hot rolled
stainless steel products from China, Indonesia and Taiwan have become effective since 8 April 2020 on top of
the safeguard. The duty has to be paid on every single tonne coming into Europe and therefore influences
relative competitiveness of domestic producers versus imports. Q2 2020 imports were limited due to a lack of
remaining safeguard quotas. Imports from countries affected by the anti-dumping duty on hot rolled coil
dropped by almost 90% in 2020 versus 2019 which demonstrates the effectiveness of these measures. An
anti-dumping complaint against cold rolled stainless steel from Indonesia and India has been filed in August
2020. Both countries accounted for ~25% of cold rolled imports in Q3 2020. The European Commission has
opened an investigation in September and has 7 to 8 months for the possible imposition of provisional
measures.

Annual Report 2020

Raw materials and Energy

Raw materials

Stainless and specialty steel production requires substantial amounts of raw materials (primarily nickel,
chromium, molybdenum, stainless and carbon steel scrap, charcoal (biomass) and iron ore). With the
exception of charcoal, which is produced internally, we are exposed to price uncertainty with respect to each
of these raw materials, which we typically purchase under short-term and long-term supply contracts, as well
as on the spot market.

Prices for these raw materials are strongly correlated with demand for stainless steel and carbon steel and
thus tend to fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand. In addition, since most of the raw
materials we use are finite resources, their prices may also fluctuate in response to any perceived scarcity of
reserves, along with the development of projects working to replace depleted reserves.

The LME nickel price started the year 2020 at U.S.$14,075 per tonne. However, as of February the rapid
spread of the COVID-19 outbreak negatively impacted the global market as demand collapsed. In this context,
the LME nickel price has been on a bearish trend and reached a year low of U.S.$11,055 at the end of March.
In the second quarter, the COVID-19 related nickel supply disruptions as well as the recovery of the Chinese
industrial activity and the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions in the key economies have supported the
LME nickel price which ended the second quarter at U.S.$12,790. Since then, supported by the good
economic data coming from China and a weakening US dollar, the LME nickel price has been bullish and
reached its 2020 highest level of U.S.$17,650 per tonne in mid of December. At the end of year, the LME
nickel price consolidated at U.S.$16.540 per tonne. The LME nickel stocks increased from 156,400 tonnes in
January to 247,900 tonnes at the end of the year.

The ferrochrome price continued the bearish trend of 2019 as the European benchmark price further
weakened to U.S.$1.01 per pound of chrome in the first quarter amid a quiet market demand. The Q2
benchmark has been concluded higher at U.S.$1.14 per pound of chrome supported by COVID-19 related
lockdowns and supply disruptions in the main producing countries such as South Africa and India. The Q3 and
Q4 European benchmark price remained at the high level of U.S.$1.14 per pound of chrome amid persistent
supply disruptions and high electricity costs in South Africa.

Molybdenum prices started the year on a healthy trend trading at U.S.$20.3 per kilogram in January to peak at
U.S.$24.03 per kilogram in February 2020 pushed by supply disruptions and strong demand. But slowing
demand from the oil & gas sector drove the molybdenum prices down to U.S.$17.2 per kilogram in March,
their lowest level since August 2017. After a short price recovery early Q2, additional COVID-19 related
demand drop negatively impacted the molybdenum prices which were down to U.S.$16.26 per kilogram at the
end of the second quarter. In the third quarter, the molybdenum prices consistently rose as demand recovered
while the Chinese imports massively increased on local supply disruptions. The molybdenum prices stood at
U.S.$22.10 per kilogram at the end of December 2020.

lron ore prices started the year on a bullish trend supported by active stockpiling in China. The 62% Fe
reference price CFR China increased to U.S.$96.7 per tonne in January. Despite remaining supply concerns,
the iron ore prices followed the negative trend of the rest of the metals complex to drop to U.S.$80.5 per tonne
in April. As market activity, led by China, recovered and supply disruptions remained a concern, the iron ore
prices bounced back to U.S.$99.43 per tonne at the end of Q2. Boosted by positive expectations for steel
demand, the iron ore prices rallied to U.S.$130.17 per tonne in September, the highest level since 2013. After
a brief softening in Q3, the iron ore prices ended the year at a strong level of U.S.$160.47 per tonne.

Ferrous scrap prices started 2020 firmly trading at U.S.$284.5 per tonne in January. But the persistent
negative sentiment on the market put a downward pressure on the ferrous scrap prices, crashing to U.S.
$201.13 per tonne in March. Easing COVID-19 restrictions supported EU domestic and Turkish demand and
the ferrous scrap prices recovered to U.S.$251.21 per tonne at the end of the second quarter. In the third
quarter, the ferrous scrap prices continued their bullish trend boosted by higher iron ore price and improved

28

Annual Report 2020

demand. At the end of the year, supported by a strong demand and a limited supply the ferrous scrap
increased again to U.S.$464.17per tonne.

Energy

With regard to natural gas, the Timdteo production facility in Brazil has a natural gas supply contract with a
Brazilian supplier. In Europe, the Group has purchased most of its natural gas through a supply contract put in
place with ArcelorMittal Energy S.C.A. in 2015.

For electricity, in France, a supply contract was put in place with ArcelorMittal Energy S.c.a. at the beginning
of 2016, whereas in Belgium such a contract has been in place since the beginning of 2015. In Brazil,
electricity needs are mainly secured through long-term contracts with several suppliers, with balancing
requirements managed through short-term arrangements.

With regard to industrial gases, the Group procures its industrial gas requirements using short- or long-term
contracts with various suppliers in different geographical regions.

Impact of exchange rate movements

At the end of 2019, the Euro amounted to 1.1234 U.S. dollar/Euro and 4.5305 Brazilian real/Euro. In 2020, the
Euro appreciated by 8.5% against the U.S. dollar to reach 1.2271 U.S. dollar/Euro. In 2020, the Euro
appreciated by 29.0% against the Brazilian real to reach 6.3779 Brazilian real/Euro.

Because a substantial portion of Aperam's assets, liabilities, sales and earnings are denominated in
currencies other than the Euro (its presentation currency), Aperam is exposed to fluctuations in the values of
these currencies relative to the Euro. These currency fluctuations, especially the fluctuation of the Euro
relative to the U.S. dollar and Brazilian real, as well as fluctuations in the currencies of the other countries in
which Aperam has significant operations and sales, can have a material impact on the results of operations.
To minimise its currency exposure, the Group enters into hedging transactions to lock in a set exchange rate
for specific transactions in non-local currencies, in accordance with its management policies.

COVID-19: health and safety,
business and accounting review

COVID-19: Health and Safety review

Health and safety remained as a top priority within the organisation. Triggered by the fast spread of
COVID-19, Aperam took immediate and swift actions in all its plants and offices to guarantee a safe workplace
for our employees. The actions were the result of joint risk analyses by management, employees and our
medical staffing, embedding the rules as imposed by authorities in the different countries and adding the best
practices presented in media, other companies and proposed employees ideas. As highlights of these actions,
we can mention : strict sanitary rules providing all needed materials like alcohol gel and increased frequency
of cleaning; clear procedures (SOPs) explaining the new way of working complemented with clear and
frequent communication; adaptation of offices and shop floor workplaces, to guarantee the necessary
distance between employees, placing of plastic shields; wearing of masks where and when needed,
implementation of smart home office to reduce the people on site to the strict necessary minimum; strict rules
applied to all visitors and contractors, all reduced to the absolute minimum needed on site. As a result, and
thanks to the contribution of all our employees, we managed to keep our assets running with only temporary
halts to implement strict health and safety protocols as described below, and avoided contamination with the
virus on our premises.

COVID-19: Business perspective related impacts and related actions

In March 2020, with the spread of COVID-19, maintaining the health of all our people required to implement
additional health & safety measures in our plants. We decided to temporarily halt our plants for the time
necessary to put in place the required health and safety arrangements, guarantee social distancing and
disinfectant routines. We also imposed a global travel ban, restricted access to our sites and encouraged
employees to work remotely wherever possible. The plant specific shutdowns differed between sites. The
plants in Genk and Brazil were able to implement the measures without a complete shutdown, while other
plants were closed for the time required for implementation. This took about 10 days on average. Our
distribution center in Italy was closed due to government orders which also continued in Q2 2020. Thanks to
the quick and decisive measures taken there has been only a small impact on the group. Direct COVID-19
related costs remained below €10 million in Q1 2020. After reopening Aperam was fully able to produce and
serve our customers. The health & safety measures successfully prevented the spread of COVID-19 in our
workforce and succeeded in guaranteeing a safe working environment for our employees.

While our plants were back to being fully operational within Q2 2020 the prolonged shutdown in several
European countries and the temporary closure of key customer industries like e.g. white goods and
automotive was negatively reflected in our order books and caused a considerable drop in demand for our
products. Due to our flexible business model we were able to align our production quickly with the lower
demand. Q2 2020 shipments dropped 14% compared to Q1 2020 and 19% versus the prior year. The low
volume was the major driver for a 30% drop in EBITDA versus Q1 2020 and -48% versus the prior year
quarter. Due to tight cost control and the successful variabilization of fixed costs Aperam was still able to
generate a positive free cash flow and remained profitable in 2020.

COVID-19: Accounting review

Due to the unforeseeable global consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, accounting estimates and
management judgements have been subject to increased uncertainty during the year 2020.

Management considered the COVID-19 outbreak and the economic downturn as impairment triggers and has

therefore updated as of June 30, 2020 the impairment testing of goodwill performed as of October 31, 2019.
Impairment tests for the cash-generating units of the group have therefore been performed as of June 30,

30

Annual Report 2020

2020 and have confirmed the correctness of the corresponding carrying amounts. This correctness has been
confirmed during the annual impairment testing of long-lived assets as of October 31, 2020.

The Company also continues to monitor and evaluate its key business drivers on an ongoing basis even if it is
difficult to properly estimate the length and severity of this COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting
consequences on its business. The negative effects have been largely mitigated with internal actions initiated
by Management like strong cost variabilization plans and a focus on cash generation.

On April 1, 2020, the Company announced that the Board of Directors decided to prudently defer the start of
the share buy-back programme announced on February 5, 2020 by six months to assess the severity and
duration of the economic contraction linked to the COVID-19, while keeping the announced dividends. On
November 4, 2020, considering the remaining exceptional COVID-19 related uncertainties, the Board of
Directors decided to postpone the 2020 share buy back program.

Finally, the Company continues to invest in improving Aperam's competitiveness in the future. In this context,
Management considers that future financial results will remain relatively resilient in a difficult macroeconomic
environment. The Company will continue to further analyse developments and consequences of COVID-19
outbreak and implement mitigating actions during the year 2021.

Annual Report 2020

In 2020, sales decreased by 12.5% compared to 2019 primarily due to lower average steel selling prices and
lower steel shipments.

Stainless & Electrical Steel

In 2020, sales in the Stainless & Electrical Steel segment (including intersegment sales) decreased by 13.6%
compared to 2019 primarily due to lower shipment volumes and decreased average steel selling prices.

Steel shipments for this segment (including inter-segment shipments) decreased by 4.8% to 1,639 thousand
tonnes for the year ending December 31, 2020, of which 591 thousand tonnes were attributable to our
operations in South America and 1,048 thousand tonnes were attributable to our operations in Europe,
including inter-segment shipments. This was down from 1,722 thousand tonnes for the year ending December
31, 2019, of which 609 thousand tonnes were attributable to our operations in South America and 1,113
thousand tonnes were attributable to our operations in Europe, including inter-segment shipments. The
average steel selling price for the Stainless & Electrical Steel segment decreased by 9.3% in 2020 compared
to 2019.

Sales to external customers in the Stainless & Electrical Steel segment were €1,660 million for the year
ending December 31, 2020, representing 46% of total sales, a decrease of 15% as compared to sales to
external customers of €1,943 million for the year ending December 31, 2019, or 46% of total sales.

Services & Solutions

In 2020, sales in the Services & Solutions segment (including intersegment sales) decreased by 14.7%
compared to 2019 primarily due to 8.5% lower steel shipments and a lower average steel selling price by
5.8% for the segment.

Sales to external customers in the Services & Solutions segment were €1,456 million for the year ending
December 31, 2020, representing 40% of total sales, a decrease of 14% as compared to sales of
€1,703 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 40% of total sales.

Alloys & Specialties

In 2020, sales in the Alloys & Specialties segment (including intersegment sales) decreased by 14.4%
primarily due to lower steel shipments by 13.9% when average steel selling price remained almost stable with
an increase of 0.7%.

Sales to external customers in the Alloys & Specialties segment were €509 million for the year ending

December 31, 2020, representing 14% of total sales, a decrease of 13% as compared to sales to external
customers of €594 million for the year ending December 31, 2019, or 14% of total sales.

which includes all operations other than those that are part of the Stainless & Electrical Steel, Services & Solutions and Alloys &
Specialties operating segments, together with intersegment eliminations and/or non-operational items that are not segmented.

The Group’s operating income for the year ending December 31, 2020, was €199 million, compared to an
operating income of €207 million for the year ending December 31, 2019. Group Adjusted EBITDA declined by
14% as the COVID-19 related lower demand also resulted in a very competitive pricing environment in
Europe. Together with a negative inventory valuation, this outweighed the positive effect from the Leadership
Journey® Phase 3, the Top Line strategy and the positive earnings development in Brazil. Exceptional gains
of net €50 million from the PIS/Cofins tax credits and restructuring provisions for the Leadership Journey®
Phase 4 also contributed to the operating income.

Stainless & Electrical Steel

The operating income for the Stainless & Electrical Steel segment was €159 million for the year ending
December 31, 2020, of which an operating income of €16 million was attributable to our operations in Europe
and €143 million was attributable to our operations in South America. This is compared to operating income of
€152 million for the year ending December 31, 2019, of which an operating income of €83 million was
attributable to our operations in Europe and €69 million was attributable to our operations in South America.
Despite the COVID-19 crisis, 2020 Adjusted EBITDA remained resilient at close to 90% of 2019, thanks to the
successful implementation of the Top Line strategy and Leadership Journey® and higher earnings in Brazil.
Negative effects in Europe where capacity utilization declined on the back of COVID-19 related lower demand
were compensated via cost variabilization, but also resulted in additional pricing pressure. Inventory valuation
was negative.

Services & Solutions

The operating income for the Services & Solutions segment was €26 million for the year ending December 31,
2020, compared to operating income of €33 million for the year ending December 31, 2019. The lower result
was mainly attributable to a lower capacity utilization resulting from the demand slowdown due to the
COVID-19 crisis and negative inventory valuation which was not fully compensated by cost savings.

Annual Report 2020

Alloys & Specialties

The operating income for the Alloys & Specialties segment was €36 million for the year ending December 31,
2020, compared to operating income of €42 million for the year ending December 31, 2019. The decrease is
mainly attributable to lower volumes which could not be completely compensated by cost savings through the
Leadership Journey®, price improvements and a less negative contribution from inventory valuation.

Financing costs

Financing costs include interest income, interest expense, net foreign exchange and derivative results and
other net financing costs. Financing income increased to €40 million for the year ending December 31, 2020,
compared to financing costs of €(23) million for the year ending December 31, 2019.

Excluding the foreign exchange and derivative results described below, net interest expense and other
financing costs for the year ending December 31, 2020 were positive at €49 million, including an exceptional
interest income of €66 million in Brazil for PIS/Cofins tax credits related to prior periods, compared to net
interest expense and other financing costs of €(30) million for the year ending December 31, 2019, including
an exceptional net financial loss of €(16) million related to the accounting effects linked to the acceptance by
bondholders of the invitation to sell their Convertible Bonds 2021 pursuant to a fixed price tender offer
process.

Net interest expense and other financing costs also includes recurring financing costs of €(17) million for the
year ending December 31, 2020, of which cash costs of financing of €(11) million, compared to recurring
financing costs of €(19) million for the year ending December 31, 2019, of which cash costs of financing of
€(10) million. Cash costs of financing are made of interests and other expenses related to the service of debt
and other financing facilities.

Realised and unrealised foreign exchange and derivative gains/losses were a loss of €(9) million for the year
ending December 31, 2020, compared to realised and unrealised foreign exchange and derivative gains of
€7 million for the year ending December 31, 2019. Foreign exchange results primarily relate to the accounting
revaluation of non-Euro assets, liabilities, sales and earnings. Results on derivatives primarily relate to the
financial instruments were entered into in order to hedge our exposure to nickel prices but which do not qualify
for hedge accounting treatment under IFRS 9.

Income Tax

We recorded an income tax expense of €(63) million for the year ending December 31, 2020, compared to an
income tax expense of €(37) million for the year ending December 31, 2019. Our 2020 income tax expense
was primarily due to positive operational results in several countries. The profit before tax of €238 million for
the year ending December 31, 2020 increased by 29% compared to the profit before tax of €185 million for
the year ending December 31, 2019 while the income tax expense increased by 70% because the portion of
profit before tax generated in high tax rate jurisdictions (mainly Brazil) was more important in the year ending
December 31, 2020 compared to the year ending December 31, 2019. The effective tax rate for the year
ending December 31, 2020 was therefore also higher at 26% compared to the effective tax rate of 20% for the
year ending December 31, 2019.

Annual Report 2020

Liquidity
Liquidity and capital resources

The Group's principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from its operations and its credit facilities at the
corporate level.

Because Aperam S.A. is a holding company, it is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of, and
dividends and distributions from, its operating subsidiaries to pay expenses and meet its debt service
obligations.

In management's opinion, the Group’s operations and credit facilities are sufficient to meet the Group’s
present requirements.

Our cash and cash equivalents amounted to €358 million and €375 million as of December 31, 2020 and
December 31, 2019, respectively.

Our total gross debt, which includes long and short-term debt, was €425 million and €450 million as of
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Net financial debt, defined as long-term debt plus
short-term debt less cash and cash equivalents (including short-term investments), was €67 million as of
December 31, 2020, compared to €75 million at December 31, 2019. Gearing, defined as net financial debt
divided by total equity, was 3% as of December 31, 2020, compared to 3% as of December 31, 2019.

As of December 31, 2020, no amount of our credit facility was drawn, leaving a credit line of €475 million
under the facilities (see more details in “Financing” section below).

In addition, as of December 31, 2020, Aperam had €54 million in debt outstanding at the subsidiary level
(including €53 million of finance leases). As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a total liquidity of €833
million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents (including short term investments) of €358 million and
committed credit lines of €475 million (revolving credit facility of €300 million and €100 million plus EIB
financing of €75 million). As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a total liquidity of €675 million,
consisting of cash and cash equivalents (including short term investments) of €375 million and committed
credit lines of €300 million (revolving credit facility of €300 million as described below).

These facilities, which include debt held at the subsidiary level, together with other forms of financing
represented an aggregate amount of approximately €0.8 billion, including a borrowing capacity of €475
million. In Management's opinion, such a financing arrangement is sufficient for our future requirements.

Financing

Unsecured revolving credit facility

On June 6, 2017, Aperam entered into a €300 million unsecured revolving credit facility (The Facility) with a
group of 10 banks. The Facility is structured as a five-year revolving credit facility with two options of
extension by one year each, replacing its U.S.$400 million three-year secured borrowing base facility. It will be
used for the company's general corporate purposes. On May 22, 2018 and May 23, 2019, the original final
maturity date of the Facility was extended by one year, to June 6, 2024.

The Facility charges interest at a rate of EURIBOR (or LIBOR, in the case of an advance denominated in U.S.
dollars) plus a margin for the relevant interest period, which may be below one, two, three or six months, or
any other period agreed to between the parties. The Facility also charges utilisation fees on the drawn portion
of the total facility amount and commitment fees on the undrawn and uncancelled portion of the total facility
amount, payable quarterly in arrears. On June 4, 2019, the Company received the consent from all lenders to
amend the calculation of the margin to be determined on levels of a “Net Leverage Ratio” as opposed to the

39


--- Page 30 ---

Annual Report 2020

Company’s previous pricing model depending on the Group's most recent corporate rating by Standard &
Poor's, Moody's, or both.

The Facility contains financial covenants, including:
* a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of €1.25 billion; and
* a maximum consolidated total debt of 70% of consolidated tangible net worth.

On December 31, 2020, these financial covenants were fully met and the credit facility was fully undrawn.
Unsecured short term revolving credit facility

On June 30, 2020, Aperam entered into a €100 million unsecured revolving credit facility (“The Short Term
Facility”) arranged with BGL BNP Paribas. The Short Term Facility is structured as a one year credit facility
and is guaranteed by the Office du Ducroire Luxembourg. \t will be used for the company's general corporate
purposes (excluding acquisitions financing) and the Company’s specific costs or expenses that have or will
arise in the context of COVID-19 outbreak. This credit facility of €100 million was fully undrawn at end
December 2020.

EIB financings

On June 27, 2016, Aperam and the European Investment Bank (EIB) announced the signing of a financing
contract in the amount of €50 million, which will be dedicated to financing a research and development
programme over the 2016-2019 period, as well as an upgrade of two plants located in cohesion regions in
France & Belgium (Isbergues, Hauts-de-France and Chatelet, Hainaut respectively). This project was funded
under the Investment Plan for Europe, also known as the "Juncker Plan”. The financing contract, which is
senior unsecured, was entirely drawn down on October 16, 2018, at a rate of 1.669%, with a final maturity
date of October 16, 2028.

On February 25, 2019, the Company announced the signature of a financing contract where the EIB will make
available to Aperam an amount of €100 million. The purpose of this contract is the financing of ongoing
investments in the cold rolling and annealing & pickling lines at Aperam’s Genk plant (Belgium), as well as the
Company’s ongoing modernisation programmes in the cohesion regions of Hauts-de-France (France) -
Isbergues plant, and Hainaut (Belgium) - Chatelet plant. The financing contract, which is senior unsecured,
was entirely drawn down on March 15, 2019, at a rate of 1.307%, with a final maturity date of March 15, 2029.

On September 30, 2020, Aperam strengthened its liquidity profile with the signature of a top-up financing
contract where the EIB will make available to Aperam an amount of €75 million, in addition to the outstanding
loan of €100 million, in relation to the financing of advanced stainless steel manufacturing technologies. This
top up facility of €75 million was fully undrawn at end December 2020.

Convertible bonds

Net share settled convertible and/or exchangeable bonds due 2021

On June 27, 2014, Aperam announced the successful placing and pricing of its offering of net share settled
convertible and/or exchangeable bonds due in 2021 (hereafter “Bonds”). Following the success of the offering,
the Company decided to exercise the extension clause in full to increase the initial offering size to U.S.$300
million. The net proceeds of the offering were targeting general corporate purposes and the refinancing of
existing indebtedness.

The Bonds were senior and unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all other existing and future
senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated
indebtedness.

The Bonds had an annual coupon of 0.625% payable semi-annually in arrears and an initial conversion price
of U.S.$43.92 representing a conversion premium of 32.5% above the reference price of U.S.$33.15 (based
on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s shares on Euronext Amsterdam between launch and
pricing of €24.3453, and an exchange rate of €1=U.S.$1.3616). The Bonds were issued and were redeemed

40


--- Page 31 ---

Annual Report 2020

at 100% of their principal amount and matured on July 8, 2021 (7 years), unless previously redeemed,
converted, exchanged, purchased or cancelled.

The Company had the option to redeem the Bonds at their principal amount plus accrued interest on or after
July 23, 2018 (4 years plus 15 days), if the parity value (translated into U.S.$ at the prevailing exchange rate)
shall have exceeded 130% of the Bonds’ principal amount.

Bondholders were entitled to have their Bonds redeemed at their principal amount plus accrued interest on
January 8, 2019 (4.5 years).

In December 2017, U.S.$0.8 million (€0.7 million) of Bonds were repurchased by the Company for a total
consideration of U.S.$1.0 million (€0.9 million).

In 2018, U.S.$55.1 million (€47.7 million) of Bonds were repurchased by the Company for a total
consideration of U.S.$69.9 million (€60.3 million).

At the end of 2018, U.S.$72.4 million (€63.2 million) of bondholders decided to exercise their put option as of
January 8, 2019. The remaining amount of debt of U.S.$164.8 million (€143.9 million) was therefore
reclassified as non-current financial liability as of December 31, 2018, and the accounting value of the debt
was updated based on initial effective interest rate leading to an accounting value of U.S.$144.1 million
(€125.9 million).

On March 25, 2019, Aperam invited holders of its outstanding bonds to offer to sell their Bonds pursuant to a
one day fixed price tender offer process. On April 2, 2019, Aperam repurchased U.S.$137 million of bonds at
a price of 107.02% (U.S.$147 million, €131 million).

The remaining portion of the U.S.$27.6 million debt, was repurchased in cash thanks to a clean-up call
(compelling the bondholders to redeem the bond at par) on November 4, 2019. An accelerated amortization of
U.S.$18 million (€16 million) has been recorded as a financial loss in the statement of operations in 2019.

Schuldscheindarlehen

On September 24, 2019, Aperam successfully priced an inaugural €190 million multi-tranches
Schuldscheindarlehen (debt instrument governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany) with
maturities at 4, 5, 6 and 7 years. On the back of a very positive investor perception and significantly
oversubscribed orderbook, Aperam was able to upsize the deal volume from the initially announced volume of
€100 million to ultimately €190 million. Interest rates vary from 1.10% to 1.50%. The company was able to
price all tranches at the tight end of the announced spread ranges. Aperam took advantage of the very
constructive market to secure attractive conditions and successfully diversify its creditors base.

Commercial paper programme

On July 10, 2018, Aperam received confirmation from Banque de France, as foreseen by art. D.213-2 of
“Code monétaire et financier” of the French law, that the conditions as described in the financial
documentation of its programme of NEU commercial paper for a maximum outstanding amount of €200
million, fulfill the requirements of law. On December 31, 2020, an amount of €37 million was drawn under the
Aperam NEU CP programme.

True sales of receivables programme

The Company has established sales without recourse of trade accounts receivable programme with financial
institutions, referred to as True Sales of Receivables (“TSR”). The maximum combined amount of the
programmes that could be utilised were €340 million and €320 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,
respectively. Through the TSR programme, certain operating subsidiaries of Aperam surrender control, risks
and the benefits associated with the accounts receivable sold. Therefore, the amount of receivables sold is

4


--- Page 32 ---

nnual Report 20

recorded as a sale of financial assets and the balances are removed from the statement of financial position
at the moment of the sale.

The total amount of receivables sold under the TSR programme and derecognised in accordance with IFRS 9
for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019 were €1.5 billion and €1.6 billion, respectively. Expenses
incurred under the TSR programme (reflecting the discount granted to the acquirers of the accounts
receivable) are recognised in the consolidated statement of operations as financing costs and amounted to
€(4) million and €(4) million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Credit ratings

On June 13, 2019, Aperam announced that it has requested to be withdrawn from the credit rating services of
S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investor Service, while reaffirming to maintain investment grade financial
ratios. Given the Company’s low level of debt and the nature of funding needs, credit rating services were no
longer considered necessary.

On June 27, 2019, Moody's Investors Service withdrew the 'Baa3' long-term issuer rating with stable outlook
of Aperam S.A.

On July 15, 2019, S&P Global Ratings withdrew its 'BBB-' long-term issuer credit rating with stable outlook of
Aperam S.A.

2020 share buyback programme cancelled due to the exceptional COVID-19 related uncertainties

On February 5, 2020, Aperam announced a share buyback programme under the authorization given by the
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on May 7, 2019 (hereinafter “Programme’).

The key features of the Programme are described below:
+ Purpose of the Programme: cancellation of shares to reduce the share capital
+ Maximum number of shares to be acquired under the Programme: 3.8 million
+ Maximum pecuniary amount allocated to the Programme: €100 million
+ Period of authorisation of the Programme: 8 February 2020 to 30 December 2020

On April 1, 2020, the Company announced that the Board of Directors decided to prudently defer the start of
the Programme by 6 months to assess the severity and duration of the economic contraction linked to the
COVID-19, while keeping the announced dividends. On November 4, 2020, Aperam announced that
considering the remaining exceptional COVID-19 related uncertainties, the Board of Directors decided to
postpone the 2020 share buy back program. As a consequence, the Company did not repurchase any of its
own shares under this Programme.

A strong focus on self-help measures

From the very beginning, Aperam has always pursued a strategy designed to reinforce the robustness of our
business using self-help measures. We accomplish this by leveraging our in-house internal improvement
measures continuously and by relying on our own resources. This has proven to be a successful strategy,
one that supports our performance by reducing our reliance on external factors/resources.

As our key strategic priorities have proven their efficiency in terms of operating and financial performance over
the past years, we will remain focused on achieving Phase 4 of the Leadership Journey® through a
combination of cost, growth and mix improvement measures.

The Leadership Journey® is an initiative aimed at achieving management gains, fixed and variable cost
reductions, and increased productivity over the near and medium-term by enhancing the potential of our best
performing assets. The Leadership Journey® is composed of a number of phases that can be broadly
characterised as restructuring and cost cutting projects, upgrading best performing assets, transformation
initiatives, and growth and mix improvements. Each phase is described below:

The Leadership Journey® initiatives by phase and total target gains:

successfully completed with €223 million of cumulated annualized gains exceeding the targeted objective of
€200 million.

Phase 4 of the Leadership Journey®: Combining growth, mix and cost improvements

On November 4, 2020, Aperam announced Phase 4 of its Leadership Journey® with a cumulative target of
€150 million gains for the period 2021 - 2023 via a combination of cost, growth and mix improvement
measures. This new phase of the Leadership Journey®, comprises two stages. First, changes to our footprint
will defend our cost leadership in Europe by bundling volumes and expertise at the most efficient lines. This
forms a solid basis for stage 2 where the resulting increase in productivity will be used for the mix
improvement and growth pillars. We plan a total cash out of €90 million for Phase 4 which comprises capex
and any associated restructuring costs.

Our growth initiatives include:

+ To grow our sales of high margin value added niche products and replace low contribution margin
products, we will continue to focus on developing innovative products through our research and
development initiatives, while also leveraging our marketing and advertising efforts for wider
promotion. This includes accelerating the stainless steel consumption in the Brazilian market.

+ Our industrial footprint in Europe and South America is perfectly complemented by our global
service centres and sales networks, which are part of our Services & Solutions segment. In a
volatile market environment, we believe that the development of the Services & Solutions segment
and the provision of better customer services are key to achieving financial and operational
excellence. Our value-added services include cutting, polishing, brushing, forming, welding,
pickling, annealing and packaging. We believe that further developing the Services & Solutions
segment will not only drive additional value creation, it will also allow us to serve our customers
more effectively.

+ The Alloys & Specialties segment focuses on the design, production and transformation of various
specialty alloys and certain specific stainless steels. These products are intended for high-end
applications or to address very specific customer requirements across a broad range of industries,
including oil and gas, aerospace, automotive, electronics, and petrochemical - to name only a few.
We believe that the Alloys & Specialties segment has significant growth potential, especially in light
of our R&D support and creative solutions we offer our customers. As an example, Aperam has
recently launched in cooperation with Tekna, a leading actor in metallic powder manufacturing, a
new company named ImphyTek Powders. It will market Nickel and Specialty Alloy spherical
powders for advanced additive manufacturing technologies.

Differentiation: Our recognized Environmental-Social-Governance leadership, strong balance sheet, financial
discipline, and value oriented M&A approach will come as a support to our cost and growth initiatives.

Our stainless steels are high added value material playing a key role in the energy transition

e-Mobility solutions
Aperam's solutions enable e-vehicle components such as converters, inverters, onboard-charges, motors, EPS, cooling
systems, air conditioning systems, current sensors, charging stations, fuel cells and battery packs

Clean air
Stainless and alloys help the marine transport sector minimizing emissions. Aperam offers scrubbing systems that remove over
90% of Sulphur and 80% of particles. Corrosion resistance grades with high mechanical properties are required

Cryogenic applications

They require a material that can withstand very low temperatures. Aperam solutions (stainless and INVAR M93 LNG tanker) are
specially designed for cryogenic storage; transporting natural gas, ethane, or ethylene: and handling liquefied air gases like
nitrogen, oxygen and argon

Sustainable water supply
Due to its inert nature, stainless is the material of choice for water supply (e.g. tanks and fountains, water boilers, sanitary
piping systems, etc.) and water treatment (e.g. sewerage, distillation, desalination) applications

Solar power

Alloys are resistant to heat, corrosion, fatigue, and creep. It is the ideal material for the receiver tubes used to ensure the flow of
molten salt and for glass metal sealing. Stainless, is the material of choice for the structural and fixing elements used in solar
power systems.

Renewable energy

> Electrical steels enable high performing wind generators due to their high permeability.

> The magnetic properties of alloys convert and shape an electrical signal from generation to end use

> Anemometric towers built of stainless stee! enjoy an increased life span, reduced maintenance costs, improved safety

The hydrogen economy
Stainless steel and alloys are already used in a number of important hydrogen applications eg fuel cells, production and storage
installations, and transportation’. Aperam is a big supporter of the shift to hydrogen and a proud member of HydrogenEurope

In Brazil, we also have a strong link to sustainable agriculture: our production process is 100% based on
charcoal from our own sustainably cultivated eucalyptus forests, which is unique in the world and gives us one
of the best carbon footprint globally. In Brazil, about 1,000 of our employees are employed in seedling, nursing
and planting eucalyptus trees. Our forest management is based upon the best practices, recognized by the
Forest Stewardship Council’s (FSC®) certification, which standards and principles conciliate ecological
protection (flora and fauna, but also water reserves) with social benefits and economic feasibility. As an
example of our responsible forest management, we use the most ecological and advanced technologies to
preserve our forests from diseases and fire. Beyond our environmental responsibility in Brazil, we are very
proud to be recognised since our creation as one the best companies to work for in Brazil in the steel industry.
Thanks to our own Foundation in Brazil we are also very much engaged in educational, cultural,
environmental and social aspects of the communities where we operate.

Performance - A competitive footprint in Europe and Brazil

Aperam's modern production facilities allow it to support its customers' stainless and specialty steel
requirements with a high-level of operational efficiency.

In Europe, the Group benefits from high-quality and cost-efficient plants, including the largest and most recent
electric arc furnace meltshop (Chatelet, Belgium), the largest hot rolling mill (Chatelet, Belgium), one of the
largest cold rolling mills (Genk, Belgium) and LC2I, the best-in-class integrated rolling-mill (Isbergues,
France). In January 2018, we announced a new investment project of €130 million at our Genk (Belgium)
plant. This consists of adding a new cold rolling and a new annealing and pickling line that further facilitate the
transformation of our business. With these state-of-the-art modern lines, which use the latest technology, we
can enlarge our product range to include the most demanding applications, improve lead-times and our
flexibility to meet market demands, increase the efficiency and cost competitiveness of our assets, and
continuously enhance our health, safety and environmental impact.

To adapt to market conditions, shortly after its creation, Aperam restructured its downstream operations from
29 to 17 tools in Europe. As a result, Aperam has reached an optimal loading of its most efficient assets and is
well positioned in Europe’s core markets. To benefit from the long-term growth potential of the stainless and
specialty steel market and further improve its cost competitiveness in a highly competitive environment,

Value add and proximity to Customer - Our Geography and Our Distribution Network

Aperam's research and development activities are closely aligned with our strategy and focus on product and
process development. The Group's Research and Development team comprises 128 employees (FTE)
spread across two centres in Europe (Isbergues and Imphy, France) and one centre in Timdteo, Brazil. These
centres interact closely with the Group's operating segments and partner with industrial end-users and leading
research organisations to remain at the forefront of product development. Our research and development
capabilities have contributed to both the Group's position as an industry leader and its development of long
standing and recognisable brands. Aperam concentrates a significant portion of its research and development
budget on high margin, value-added niche products, such as specialty alloys, and on developing products with
enhanced capabilities for new applications and end markets. As our customers look to lower their carbon
footprint, Aperam is present with a wide range of products answering the strong demand for more
sustainability. Some of our solutions are highlighted below.

According to the International Stainless Steel Forum (ISSF), the Company is the second largest producer in
Europe, and the leading stainless and specialty steel producer in South America. Aperam is well-positioned in
both developed and emerging markets. At the Group level, approximately 72% of Aperam’s sales are derived
from developed markets and 28% from emerging markets.

Aperam has a strong presence in the European stainless steel market. Not only are the Group's modern
production facilities in Belgium and France strategically located close to scrap generating regions, they are
also close to the Group’s major customers. Aperam’s European industrial operations have consistently
maintained high performance standards through the optimisation of production volumes, inventory and costs.

The Group also has a highly integrated and technically advanced service centre and distribution network that
is effective at maintaining direct contact with end-users through its strong sales and marketing capabilities.

Annual Report 2020

Aperam’s integrated stainless and specialty steel sales, distribution and service networks has a total of 14
Steel Service Centres, 5 transformation facilities and 17 sales offices, and is one of the largest in the world.
This network, along with its best-in-class service, allows the Group to develop customer loyalty and a
consistent and stable customer base, while also capturing additional value in downstream operations. The
Group's distribution channels are strategically located in areas of high demand and close to many end-users.
The Group's global distribution network enables it to tailor its products to address specific customer needs,
thereby facilitating the maintenance of our market share and the capturing of growth opportunities. The
Group's customer base is well diversified, consisting of a number of blue chip clients.

Our Premium Products - Alloys and Stainless Specialties

Aperam offers a wide range of products, including high margin value-added niche products to a diversified
customer base in both emerging and developed markets. It is this diverse product offering, sold to a wide
range of customers across numerous industries, that allows the Group to enjoy greater stability and to
mitigate some of the risks and cyclicality inherent in certain markets.

The Group's products are mainly sold to end-users in the automotive, building and construction, catering and
appliance, energy and chemicals, and transportation industries. Our electrical steel products are primarily sold
to customers in the electric motors, generators and transformers industries. We are the fourth largest global
producer of specialty alloys and the largest producer of alloys wire rods and strips, which are sold to
customers in the aerospace, automotive, electronics, petrochemical, and oil & gas industries. As an example,
Aperam has recently incorporated together with Tekna Plasma Europe, a leading actor in metallic powder
manufacturing, a new joint-venture company named ImphyTek Powders SAS. It will market Nickel and
Specialty Alloy spherical powders for advanced additive manufacturing and metal injection molding
technologies.

In addition, Aperam's leading position in specialty alloys, which is a particularly high margin value added
niche, helps the Group maintain and improve its margins and profitability.

Principal risks and uncertainties related to the
Company and the stainless and specialty
steel industry

The following major factors could cause actual results to materially differ from those
discussed in the forward-looking statements included throughout this Annual Report:

Macro-economic & geopolitical risks indirectly impacting Aperam

Global economic cycle downturn

2020 has been an unprecedented year with demand falling globally due to COVID-19. Due to COVID-19 we
expect very high sovereign debts, higher inflation and unemployment in certain sectors hit hardest. The speed
of recovery most likely will be regional.

Aperam’s business and results of operations are substantially affected by international, national and regional
economic conditions, including geopolitical risks that could disrupt the economic activity in affected countries.
The re-emergence of recessionary conditions or a period of weak growth in Europe, or slow growth in
emerging economies that are, or are expected to become, substantial consumers of stainless and specialty

53


--- Page 44 ---

nnual Report 20

steels (such as China, Brazil, Russia and India, as well as other emerging Asian markets and the Middle East)
would have a material adverse effect on the stainless and specialty steel industry.

Overcapacity

In addition to economic conditions, the stainless steel industry is affected by global production capacity and
fluctuations in stainless steel imports and exports. Production capacity in the developing world, particularly
China and Indonesia, has increased substantially, with China being the largest global stainless steel producer.
Accordingly, the balance between China’s domestic production and consumption is an important factor
impacting global stainless steel prices. Stainless steel exports from these countries, or conditions favourable
to them (such as excess capacity in China / Indonesia and/or higher market prices for stainless steel in
markets outside of China/Indonesia) can have a significant impact on stainless steel prices in other markets,
including Europe and South America. Over the short- to medium-term, Aperam is exposed to the risk of
stainless steel production increases in China and other markets (including Indonesia) outstripping increases in
real demand, which may weigh on price recovery in the industry as a whole.

China slowdown

A reduction in China’s economic growth rate, with a resulting reduction in stainless and specialty steel
consumption, coupled with China’s expansion of steel-making capacity, could continue to substantially
weaken both domestic and global stainless and specialty steel demand and pricing.

The risks of nickel price fluctuation, raw material price uncertainty, material margin squeeze,
over dependency of main suppliers and electricity

Aperam’s profitability correlates, amongst other factors, with nickel prices. A significant decrease in the price
of nickel would have a negative impact on apparent demand and base prices due to “wait and see” behaviour
by customers. Furthermore, nickel is listed on the LME and thus subject to the fluctuation of the financial
markets. Stainless and specialty steel production requires substantial amounts of raw materials (primarily
nickel, chromium, molybdenum, stainless and carbon steel scrap, charcoal (biomass) and iron ore), which can
lead to an over-dependence on its main suppliers. Aperam is also exposed to price uncertainty and material
margin squeeze with respect to each of these raw materials, which it mainly purchases under short- and long-
term contracts, but also on the spot market. During the last months of 2020, following the impact of the
COVID-19 1st wave, prices and margins have recovered, but remain lower than the historical average of the
period 2016-2019. Considering the lack of efficient trade defense in Europe, margins may remain under
pressure looking forward. Price cost squeeze due to higher cost of Raw Materials may also impact the
Company considering higher raw material prices, and developments of regulations in Asia on scrap which
could tighten the stainless steel scrap market, in Europe.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates

Aperam operates and sells its products globally, and a substantial portion of its assets, liabilities, costs, sales
and income are denominated in currencies other than the Euro (Aperam’s reporting currency). Accordingly,
currency fluctuations triggered by inflationary movements or other factors, especially the fluctuation of the
value of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real, as well as fluctuations in the currencies of
the other countries in which Aperam has significant operations and/or sales, could have a material impact on
its results of operations.

Litigation risks (product liability, patent infringement, commercial practices, employment,
employment benefits, taxes, environmental issues, health & safety)

A number of lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been and may be asserted against Aperam in relation to
the conduct of its currently and formerly owned businesses, including those pertaining to product liability,
patent infringement, commercial practices, employment, employee benefits, taxes, environmental aspects,
health and safety, and occupational disease. In particular, Aperam is subject to a broad range of
environmental laws and regulations in each of the jurisdiction in which it operates. Such laws and regulations
focus in particular on air emissions, wastewater storage, treatment and discharges, the use and handling of

54


--- Page 45 ---

nnual Report 20

hazardous or toxic substances, slag treatment, soil pollution, waste disposal practices and the remediation of
environmental contamination.

Due to the uncertainties of litigation, no assurance can be given that the Company will prevail on all claims
made against it in the lawsuits that it currently faces or that additional claims will not be made against it in the
future. While the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some of these lawsuits, claims
or proceedings may have an outcome that is adverse to Aperam, Management does not believe that the
disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on Aperam’s financial
condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations for that period.

Risks of lack of competitiveness of the workforce costs, of retention and social conflicts

Aperam's total cost per employee is the main factor of our cost disadvantage against competitors in certain
countries. A lack of competitiveness in workforce costs might have a material adverse effect on Aperam’s cost
position. Aperam’s key personnel have extensive knowledge on its business and, more generally, on the
stainless and specialty steel sector as a whole. Its inability to retain key personnel and/or the experience of
social conflicts could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations
or cash flows.

Customer risks in respect to default and credit insurance companies refusing to ensure the
risks

Due to the challenging economic climate, Aperam might experience increased exposure to customer defaults
or situations where credit insurance companies refuse to insure the recoverability risks of its receivables.
Such a scenario could have a material effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

Cybersecurity risks

Aperam’s operations depend on the secure and reliable performance of its information technology systems.
An increasing number of companies, including Aperam, are experiencing intrusion and phishing attempts for
money transfers, as well as attempts at disabling information technology systems. If such attempts would
succeed, they could cause application unavailability, data confidentiality failures, adverse publicity and, in the
case of an intrusion to our process systems, interruptions to the Group’s operations. The Group could be
subject to litigation, civil or criminal penalties, and adverse publicity - all of which could adversely affect its
reputation, financial condition and results of operations.

Risk of production equipment breakdown or stoppage and risk of pandemic virus due to
COVID-19 or other type of future virus

Stainless steel manufacturing processes are dependent on critical steelmaking equipment, such as furnaces,
continuous casters, rolling mills and electrical equipment (such as transformers). This equipment may incur
downtime as a result of unanticipated failures or other events, such as fires, severe climate events, explosions
or furnace breakdowns.

The risk of pandemic due to COVID-19 or other type of disease could also affect our employees and lead to
high absenteeism rate, up to fatalities in our production premises. While we have implemented strict health
and safety protocols (please see section “COVID-19: health and safety, business and accounting review’),
such pandemic may impact our production processes.

Aperam’s manufacturing plants have experienced, and may in the future experience, plant shutdowns or
periods of reduced production as a result of such process failures, or other events such as natural disasters,
epidemics or pandemics or extreme weather events.

To the extent that lost production resulting from such a disruption cannot be compensated for by unaffected
facilities, the disruption could have an adverse effect on Aperam’s operations, customer service levels and
results of operations.
