THE L'OREAL GROUP: FUNDAMENTALS

1.1.1. A CLEAR MISSION AND STRATEGY,

SUPPORTED BY STABLE
GOVERNANCE

For over 100 years, L'Oréal has devoted itself to one business :
beauty, in which it is the world’s leading company. It is the
Group’s raison d’étre, because, far from being futile and
superficial, cosmetics are full of meaning. They give everyone
self-confidence, enable them to blossom and open up to
others and contribute to individual and collective well-being.

Boasting an_ international portfolio of 34 diverse and
complementary brands, the Group responds to all beauty
aspirations worldwide. Present in all distribution channels,
L’'Oréal generated sales of €26.02 billion in 2017 thanks to its
82,606 employees across the globe.

The Group’s governance, the guarantee of stability in a
changing world, makes it possible to work towards long-term
objectives and to ensure regular growth.

THE L;OREAL GROUP: FUNDAMENTALS

A balanced and committed Board of Directors,
which plays its role of reflection and strategic
impetus to the full

The Board of Directors determines L’Oréal’s — strategic
orientations and ensures their implementation. It oversees the
management of both the financial and extra-financial aspects,
and ensures the quality of the information provided to the
shareholders and to the market.

The structure of L’Oréal’s Board makes it possible to take into
account the specificities of its shareholding structure while
guaranteeing the interests of all its stakeholders. At 31
December 2017, there were 15 Board members : the Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Jean-Paul Agon, 5 Directors
from the Group's principal shareholders (the Bettencourt
Meyers family with Mrs Frangoise Bettencourt Meyers, Mr
Jean-Pierre Meyers and Mr Jean-Victor Meyers, and Nestlé with
Mr Paul Bulcke and Mrs Béatrice Guillaume-Grabisch), 7
independent Directors (Mrs Sophie Bellon, Mrs Belén Garijo, Mrs
Virginie Morgon, Mrs Eileen Naughton, Mr Charles-Henri Filippi,
Mr Xavier Fontanet and Mr Bernard Kasriel), and 2 Directors
representing the employees (Mrs Ana Sofia Amaral and Mr
Georges Liarokapis). All of them make sure that the Board's
work is carried out on a collective basis with the common
objective of ensuring the Group’s long-term development.

The Board takes steps to ensure that the Directors are from differen
backgrounds, and most of them have international experience
acquired in groups with a global dimension, and complementary
skills ; industrial, financial, digital and above all entrepreneuria
competencies. The diversity of skills and expertise on the Board
enables it to understand rapidly and in detail the developmen
issues facing L'Oréal, the leader on a highly competitive globalised
cosmetics market, in a fast-changing world.

L'Oréal is attentive to compliance with the principle o
balanced gender representation on the Board: 46% of its
members are women (excluding Directors representing
employees), and 2 committees out of 4 are chaired by
women, the Audit Committee and the Appointments and
Governance Committee.

Ethics, at the heart of Group governance and commitments

L’'Oréal has built up its business on the basis of strong Ethical
Principles that guide its development and contribute to
establishing its reputation: Integrity, Respect, Courage and
Transparency. L’Oréal’s commitment to acting ethically and
responsibly is summarised in a document called “The L’Oréal
Spirit” accessible to everyone.

These principles underpin the Group's culture and business
model. They inform our compliance, responsible innovation,
environment, corporate social responsibility and philanthropy
policies. The L’Oréal code of Ethics is available in 45 languages
and in Braille (in English and French). It is given to all
employees around the world. Country Managers (or for
Corporate or Zone staff, the members of the Group’s Executive
Committee to whom they report) are responsible for ensuring
compliance with the code.

Activities of the Board and its committees in 2017

The Board of Directors fully assumes its role in defining the
Group's strategic orientations.

Thanks to an open and constructive dialogue with the General
Management and regular meetings with management, the
Directors are completely up-to-date with L’Oréal’s economic
reality and fully informed of all the Company’s activities, its
performances and the challenges it faces. They examine the
main areas and opportunities for long-term development and
acquisitions in particular.

The Directors make sure that the decisions taken contribute to
implementation of the strategy.

Wishing to continually enhance its role of reflecting on issues
and providing support with regard to _ strategic
decision-making, the Board carried out an evaluation of its
modus operandi and organisation in 2017, as it has done
every year since 1996.

A CLEAR STRATEGY: BEAUTY FOR ALL

Demand for beauty is universal. L’‘Oréal deploys a global strategy to satisfy this demand.

1.2.1. UNIVERSALISATION, TO MEET

GLOBAL DEMAND FOR BEAUTY

L'Oréal relies on a single strategy - Universalisation - meaning
globalisation that respects differences. This strategy aims at
offering beauty attuned to the specific expectations of
consumers in every region of the world. It is based on a keen
ability to listen to consumers and a profound respect for their
differences in each and every country.

This is why the Group's Research and Marketing teams in alll its
markets are alive to the specific needs of its customers and
laboratories around the world. The innovation policy is based
on affordability and on the adaptation of products to the
beauty rituals and lifestyles of all men and women in their
infinite diversity.

1.2.2. AN INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE

L'Oréal was founded in France in 1909 and quickly expanded
in Western Europe and developed a significant and strategic
presence in these markets. In 2017, it generated 31.2% of its
cosmetics sales on this historical territory. To make
Universalisation a really powerful strategy, the global market
has been organised into 5 large homogeneous regions, even
more attentive to consumers and closer to their desires.

In addition to the country and marketing strategy which
underlies Universalisation, the Group is a resolutely multi-centric
organisation with its “nerve centre” in France. Each major
region has it own centre of expertise or excellence for
Research and Marketing activities. Research therefore has 6
hubs across the globe, led by central teams and fuelled by the
Group’s core expertise and fundamental knowledge.

After establishing its presence in Western Europe, L’Oréal
gained a foothold in North America in the first half of the 20"
century. Initially, the Group entrusted distribution companies
with commercialising its products, these companies being
united in 1953 around an exclusive agent, Cosmair. Following
Cosmair's takeover in 1994, the Group developed in North
America with the status of a subsidiary. The acquisition of
brands such as Maybelline (1996), Matrix and Kiehl's (2000),
Urban Decay (2012), or more recently NYX Professional
Makeup (2014), IT Cosmetics (2016) and CeraVe (2017) have
considerably reinforced its presence in North America.

Beginning in the 1970s, the Latin America Zone developed with
a multi-divisional organisation that the Group has since
adopted in the other major regions of the world.

12 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT / LOREAL 2017

Present in Japan for nearly 50 years, L’'Oréal has expanded its
presence in the country by choosing the brands to be given
priority for this extremely specific market: Kérastase in hair
salons, Lancéme in Luxury products and Maybelline and
L’'Oréal Paris in mass-market products.

The 1990s witnessed the opening up of New Markets with very
strong development in Eastern Europe. At the same time, the
Group extended its activities to more distant markets like India
or China.

L'Oréal was among the first foreign groups to obtain an
authorisation from the Indian government in 1994 to create a
wholly-owned subsidiary with its registered office in Mumbai.
In 1997, the Group created a large multi-divisional zone in Asia
and opened new subsidiaries, particularly in China where
L'Oréal holds all of the capital of its entity.

The mid 2000s were another turning point: a sharp
acceleration in growth of the New Markets led to a shift in the
economic world’s centre of gravity.

Africa and the Middle East, where the Group lacked a strong
presence, became a new frontier for development.

In total, the percentage of cosmetics sales generated by the
Group in the New Markets was 15.5% in 1995, 27.1% in 2006
and 40.5% in 2017. Sales in New Markets increased greatly as a

proportion of the Group's total sales between 2006 and 2017.
This trend is expected to continue.

The Group has a well-balanced geographical footprint across
most of the world’s main markets.

The New Markets show considerable growth potential: in many
countries, the consumption of cosmetics products per
inhabitant is 10 to 20 times lower than in mature countries.
Every year across the globe, several tens of millions of people
gain access to income levels that make them part of the
“middle classes”, enabling them to afford modern cosmetics
products.

Growth in the beauty market in 2017 was between 4 and 5%.
However, overlapping distribution channels, and the extremely
rapid growth of e-commerce make it more difficult to estimate
the pace of growth in each channel. All in all, we saw
contrasting growth patterns by region and by distribution
segment.

Growth was robust for make-up in 2017, particularly in the
selective market. Skincare sales accelerated throughout the
year to become the leading contributor to growth in the
beauty market.

The selective market surged ahead, powered by China and
Travel Retail, to make the largest contribution to growth in the
beauty market in 2017.

We estimate that the pace of growth in the mass market was
slower than in 2016, especially in the United States, Brazil,
Japan and Russia. China recovered during the year, but
conditions remained very tough in the Gulf states and in
France.

in Southern Europe.

The pace of growth picked up in New Markets to account for

China, with double-digit growth, and outside China. The

Beauty market outlook

Beauty is a universal aspiration that will continue to feed
sustainable growth in the cosmetics market. The main drivers in
the market will be accelerated growth in the middle classes in
emerging economies, who will aspire to consume more
high-quality cosmetic products, as well as the expansion of
categories with further untapped potential in mature
economies. Estimates project that the market will double in the
next 15 years.

As digital and social networks explode around the world,
evolving lifestyles will see the emergence of a new era to buoy
growth: the era of “social beauty’, social, connected, shared
beauty. Beauty will become even more essential, as
appearance increasingly reflects people's personality and is

Presentation of the Group Integrated report
A CLEAR STRATEGY : BEAUTY FOR ALL

seen as vital both for their self-confidence and relations with
others.

Consumer expectations have shifted dramatically in this new
era: they want more individualised relations and ongoing
dialogue with the brands they use in each country; they
expect personalised advice on choosing and using products;
and they want an immersive and unique purchasing
experience, with direct access to brands, especially through
online sales channels or in specialist shops.

L’Oréal is an agile and flexible organisation that is quick to
react. The ability to select and continuously fine-tune
advertising and communication materials to more demanding
customers is part of its essential value proposition.

1.2.4. A PORTFOLIO OF DIVERSE AND COMPLEMENTARY BRANDS

To meet the beauty expectations of consumers all over the
world, the Group has the richest, most varied and most
powerful brand portfolio in the cosmetics industry. Moreover, its
brands are constantly being reinvented so that they are
always a perfect match with local consumer demand.

New acquisitions also regularly provide valuable additions to
this unique portfolio to respond to consumer trends.

Some of these acquisitions are global brands, such as the
CeraVe skincare brand in the Active Cosmetics Division
portfolio; or US make-up brands like Urban Decay and IT
Cosmetics, which make a tremendous contribution to L’Oréal
Luxe; or NYX Professional Makeup, an affordable, make-up

artist-inspired brand; or Decléor, which extends the growth
potential of Professional Products to the professional skincare
field.

Other acquisitions aim to extend the Group's geographical
footprint: in Colombia with the make-up brand Vogue, in
Kenya with Interbeauty, and also in Brazil with Niely
Cosmeticos, and in China with Magic Holdings.

These newly acquired companies, through their integration
and deployment, are helping to accelerate the Group's
penetration of their markets, and help to drive organic growth
going forward.

1.2.5. REINVENTING RESEARCH & INNOVATION

Adapting to world markets

Listening to consumers to improve innovation

More than a century has passed since chemist Eugéne
Schueller invented the first harmless hair colourants and
ounded L'Oréal. Science and innovation were written into the
Group's genetic code and quickly became one of the keys to
its success.

Determined to offer everyone, everywhere in the world, the
best of cosmetics in terms of quality, efficacy and safety,
L’'Oréal continues to push the boundaries of science and to
leverage its CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) policy as a
source of new innovation opportunities.

nventing beauty by meeting the aspirations of millions of
women and men remains a_ steadfast commitment. By
remaining ahead of the game in product performance,
research at L’Oréal is anchored in a Sustainable Development
approach. All ingredients are respectful of customers and the
environment.

A nexus of regional scientific ecosystems

L'Oréal has a powerful Research & Innovation (R&I) model with
unique expertise and a formidable bank of scientific and

technical data, which represent a veritable asset. Advanced
Research creates, develops and sources active ingredients
and raw materials drawing on its knowledge of skin and hair
around the world. Applied Research invents formula
architectures that increase asset performance tenfold and the
Development laboratories create innovative formulas with a
proven superiority for each brand.

This innovation model is nurtured by a constant dialogue
between the laboratories and marketing to respond to the
aspirations of consumers and to offer technological
breakthroughs to change behaviour patterns.

In the course of the past five years, R&I has become global,
more open, and more customer-focused. This trend supports
the Group's strategy of strengthening its global presence and
extending outwards from France through six regional hubs
(Japan, China, India, USA, Brazil and South Africa). These
regional hubs identify the needs of consumers and their
cosmetic practices. R&l has strengthened its capacity for
innovation and to respond to the infinite diversity of beauty
needs all over the world.

Openness and agility: a breath of fresh air

The scientific and technical ecosystems in emerging
non-beauty fields offer a rich seam of possibility for L’'Oréal,
whose research teams have entered into collaboration
agreements with universities and scientific institutes (Open
Research), formed partnerships with suppliers and start-ups
(Open Innovation) and set up ties with the best subcontractors
(Open Development).

At the same time, Research is gradually rolling out a
project-based model for faster and more agile working. This
approach combines multidisciplinary teams, fast prototyping
and interaction with consumers to develop the right products
at the right time.

By focusing on its major areas of expertise, R&I is steadily
pursuing its policy of improving the performance of completely
safe and exemplary products, refocusing on consumers, agility
and speed, drawing on digital technologies, and ensuring that
innovation remains its foremost concern.
Safe ingredients for impeccable products

New advances in replacing animal testing

In the drive to guarantee consumer safety, the cosmetics
industry must make sure that the ingredients in a finished
product do not cause adverse reactions, such as skin allergies
or eye irritation. The European Union banned animal testing in
2013, making alternative in vitro methods more important than
ever in predicting potential side effects.

In October, the OECD (Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development) announced the adoption o
two new methods developed by L’Oréal’s research teams as
alternatives to animal testing to evaluate skin allergies and eye
irritation. These two scientific methods add to the testing
options available with a broader and more efficient range o
alternative assessment methods that avoid the need for
animal testing. The inclusion of these two methods in the OECD
Test Guidelines (TG442E and TG492) amounts to international
recognition and regulatory acceptance for all industries tha
may use these tests.

ISO 16128!: an international standard for natural
and organic ingredients and products

ISO 16128 is the first independent global standard to provide a
definition of natural and organic cosmetic ingredients and
products, or their by-products. The standard provides a
comprehensive and rigorous definition of a natural or organic
ingredient or product based on origin (natural or organic) and
extraction process. It provides consistent global criteria for
natural and organic products. The ISO 16128 reference on the
packaging will provide customers with a clear marker of the
percentage of natural ingredients in the product. It is a
guarantee of transparency for brands that meet the criteria to
use it. A harmonised global definition of natural and organic
ingredients and their by-products is a major advance for
cosmetics.

Innovation policy

Renewing product formulations

Emulsions have long been the formulation of choice for most
cosmetics. To take things to the next level, work was
conducted to discover how to combine seemingly
incompatible compounds - without surfactants - to deliver
new and exciting functionality. Innovation in this field means
exploring new areas not covered by emulsions. The result was
the development of the exclusive Alliagel technology based
on the inter-penetration of incompatible gels. It has many
advantages, including: a new sensory signature, optimised
availability of active ingredients and remarkable optical effects
under certain conditions. Suitable for nearly all product
categories, the technology demonstrates the crucial
importance of perceived performance for product
formulation (for example: Infaillible Total Cover by L'Oréal Paris
and Dermablena's 3D Correction).

The explosion of colours in hair colourants

Hot on the heels of the rash of make-up products came the
trend for hair make-up. Hair colour used to be almost
exclusively about covering white and grey hair. Enter a
younger, more creative and fully digitised target market. Hair
colour has become a_ vehicle for self-expression for
millenials © for whom the colour in their locks is as interesting
as their make-up.

Being ahead of the curve to quickly seize the opportunity and
respond to emerging needs means combining the best
technologies to create the desired effects. L'Oréal's long track
record in hair colour meant a rapid response to meet the
challenge in less than six months. In record time, L'Oréal
launched a number of different haircare lines, ranging from
make-up to permanent hair colourants - a feat that was only
possible by drawing on the technologies developed over
several years (such as Colorista by L’Oréal Paris and City Beats
by Redken).

Massage device for rejuvenation based
on mechanobiology

After nine years of research in collaboration with the Medical
Biology Institute of Singapore, Institut Langevin and Denis
Diderot University in Paris, L'Oréal’s Research launched the first
ever massage device based on mechanobiology, the science
of cell and tissue mechanics and how they react to
mechanical stimuli (pressure, twisting or stretching). This
disruptive innovation opens up the possibility of combating the
signs of ageing without resorting to invasive procedures. The
teams demonstrated that the vibrations of the three-point
massage head have a biological effect on the skin,
depending on the stimulation frequency. A clinical trial
confirmed significant improvement in several clinical signs of
ageing, especially skin elasticity and the firmness of skin
around the edges of the face (for example: Clarisonic's
Smart Profile Upliff).

Matching the product to my skin profile

Skin is continually changing and renewing. The proteins on the
surface of the epidermis are not only markers of the skin's state of
health (dry, hydrated, inflamed, etc.), but also give information to
predict how the skin will age (wrinkles, stains, dryness, etc.).
Current, traditional clinical trials involving hundreds _ of
participants are both lengthy and costly. Now, the skin diagnostic
system - known as miniaturised proteomic diagnostics -
developed by Korean start-up NanoEntek (a L’Oréal R&I partner)
can analyse these proteins in a matter of minutes and determine
the skin profile: and combine it with optical skin diagnosis
techniques and a questionnaire for skincare personalisation. This
all-new service points the way of the future.

profile of 100% of its products by 2020. This is a major paradigm
shift: from now on, whenever the Group's teams invent or
update a product, they take account not only of the product's
performance and profitability, but also its contribution to
sustainability. To do this, they act on at least one of the criteria
illustrated below:

The Operations Division harnesses the most specialised, agile,
effective and connected technological expertise, from
packaging design and product development, sourcing and
production through to distribution of all the Group's products,
in order to enable the brands to offer consumers worldwide the
most advanced cosmetic solutions.

Assuming its fundamental responsibilities, the Operations
Division guarantees consumers compliance with _ strict
standards of quality, safety, security and societal and
environmental responsibility all over the world.

At the forefront of new technologies to better
serve consumers with increasing demands

The Operations 4.0 programme aims to accelerate the digital
transformation of Operations. We are embracing new
technologies from end to end of the value chain to respond to
new consumer demands.

For product development, 3D printing of prototypes for
products and/or functional components reduces
development times and therefore brings products to the
market faster. This fast prototyping allows to respond with
agility to consumers' new beauty expectations and to keep
pace with evolving cosmetic trends. Two new 3D printing labs
were opened in 2017 at L’Oréal sites near Paris and New York.

In production, the combination of technologies like 3D
printing, artificial intelligence, connected objects (Internet of
Things, lol), cobots (collaborative robots) and virtual reality
are new tools to assist operators in production and to develop
new, agile and more flexible production lines.
The Internet of Things (loT) and Big Data usher in exciting
prospects for traceability and productivity by improving supply
chains, creating smoother flows in stores, managing the
omni-channel experience and providing increased interaction
with consumers.

At the centre of design and development,
innovation of packaging

he packaging of a product is the first identifying link between
a brand and its consumers. Beyond its technical performance
and its function, packaging is a key differentiating factor for
he product and therefore for the value perceived by the
consumer. Every year, L’Oréal’s teams of design and
development specialists provide cutting-edge innovations with
3 centres of expertise: Europe, Asia and the Americas. L’Oréal
iled 91 patents for packaging and processes in 2017.

L’Oréal increasingly uses digital technologies more and more
in the design and development of its packaging, to offer
consumers connected, smart beauty products and services
hat meet their specific needs.

Since 2007, eco-design has been part of L'Oréal's innovation
approach: Respect consumers and the environment; Reduce
packaging volume and weight; Replace high-impact materials
with recycled materials or materials from renewable resources.
By the end of 2017, the social or environmental profile of 76% of
new or redesigned products had been improved. The Group
currently includes up to 100%-recycled plastic in some of its
packaging.

A purchasing programme combining
economic and social value

To accompany the Group’s growth - both from a
geographical and technological standpoint - the Purchasing
teams select the most efficient and cost-effective suppliers in
accordance with the L’Oréal Buy and Care responsible
purchasing programme. They manage their performance, with
suppliers, by monitoring precise indicators relating to social,
environmental and ethical criteria and through their ability to
innovate and to meet the Group’s requirements in terms of
quality, service and competitiveness.

L’Oréal builds solid relationships with its suppliers and this
makes it possible to work with them on their supply chains and
thus ensure the agility, reliability and traceability of sourcing
(for raw materials and packaging). In 2017, the Group
conducted 1,231 social audits, making a total of more than
9,400 since 2006.

Furthermore, by creating the responsible purchasing
programme called Solidarity Sourcing, L'Oréal chose as from
2010 to enable sourcing from suppliers with a solidarity model.
In other words, companies that offer employment to vulnerable
workers and people in deprived communities, such as
disabled workers, people from underprivileged backgrounds
or fair trade suppliers (see 3.2.4.3. Solidarity Sourcing).

In a beauty market that pursued its steady growth in
2017, L’'Oréal had a good year with sustained sales
growth momentum, and robust profits. As announced,
the second half accelerated compared with the first,
particularly in the fourth quarter with +5.5% like-for-like
growth.

All the Divisions recorded sales growth, especially L'Oréal
Luxe which is delivering spectacular growth, particularly
in Asia. The Active Cosmetics Division achieved more
than 2 billion euros of sales for the first time. Growth in
the Consumer Products Division is being slowed by the
continuing difficulties of the American and French
markets, while sales in the Professional Products Division
improved at the end of the year.

Today more than ever, L'Oréal can rely on its unique
portfolio of powerful and complementary brands, eight
of which now have sales above one billion euros.

As for the geographic zones, the New Markets exceeded
more than 10 billion euros of sales for the first time ever,
hanks especially to the dynamism of the Asia, Pacific
Zone. Performance in Western Europe remained solid.

2017 was especially notable for the accentuation of
L'Oréal’s digital edge and the strengthening of the
positions of the Group in two strategic channels. Firstly in
e-commerce®, where the Group sales accelerated to
reach 2 billion euros, an increase of +33.6%. Secondly in
ravel Retail, a channel with strong potential, in which
L'Oréal celebrated 40 years of presence by
strengthening its number one position.

n terms of results, as announced, operating margin has

2018 prospects

As for 2018, in a market that should remain dynamic and
contrasted, L’Oréal more than ever before has the best
advantages in terms of innovation, brand power, digital
prowess, and the quality of its teams all over the world, to win
market share and strengthen its Beauty leadership. L'Oréal is
therefore confident that, this year once again, it will outperform
the market and achieve significant growth in like-for-like sales
and an increase in profitability.

1.3.1.5. L'Oréal’s investment policy responds

to long-term objectives

L'Oréal is an industrial company which develops chiefly
through two types of investment:

1. scientific investments and investments in equipment which
are explained at length in several sections of this document
(see in particular section 1.2.5. and section 1.2.6.);

2. marketing investments which are made on an ongoing
basis and are inherent to the Group’s activities in the
cosmetics industry. To capture new market share, in-depth
research tailored to each situation must be conducted,
and advertising and promotional expenses need to be
attuned to the familiarity of the brands and _ their
competitive position in each country. Lastly, investments in
pointof sale (POS) advertising materials ensure optimal
presence for our brands in points of sale.

For reasons relating to strategy and competition, L’Oréal
cannot therefore provide any systematic information on future
investments.

In 2017, the Group's investments totalled €1,264 million, or 4.9%
of its sales. This level reflects the Group’s constant efforts in
terms of improving industrial efficiency, research and digital
development performance and enhancing brand value.

1.3.2. CONSTANT, SHARED GROWTH

Priority to human capital

L'Oréal has always been guided by humanist values that have
led it to place the individual and talent at the very heart of its
organisation. As its founder, Eugéne Schueller affirmed with
conviction “a company is not walls and machines but men,
men and more men.”

These strategic intangible assets are one of the Group’s main
competitive advantages in the long term, alongside its brands,
governance and Research.

The Group’s human and social project revolves around two
priorities: the first is individual performance development of
employees and future leaders and the second is social
performance.

L'Oréal has always targeted constant, sustainable growth.

Since its very beginnings, the Group has been committed to
developing its presence in all regions of the world by applying
the fundamental rules of a good corporate citizen. The
products offered to consumers meet the highest quality
standards; the Group's social commitments are the same in all
its subsidiaries; all production centres comply with the same
rules aimed at reducing their environmental footprint. Social
audits are conducted in relation to the suppliers of plants and
distribution centres.

Each subsidiary contributes, in accordance with its resources,
to the L’Oréal Foundation's major programmes, notably “For
Women in Science”, “Beauty for a Better Life”, or other Group
philanthropic initiatives, such as Hairdressers against Aids (see
chapter 3). Above and beyond its solid long-term economic
performances, the Company seeks to be exemplary and sets
itself demanding standards in order to limit its environmental

footprint. In October 2013, all the L’Oréal Group's Sustainable
Development commitments were formally provided for and
structured at a strategic level within the scope of the Sharing
Beauty With All programme.

Sharing Beauty With All

The Sharing Beauty With All programme presents the targets
that the Group has set itself for 2020 with the aim of reducing
its environmental impact and increasing its social
commitments, while sharing its growth with the surrounding
communities. Every year, L'Oréal reports on its strategy and its
results transparently and giving figures via performance
indicators. A panel of independent international experts called
the Panel of Critical Friends meets regularly to review progress
made and take a critical look at the actions taken and
suggest improvements.

The Sharing Beauty With All programme stands out for its
complete integration into the Company's value chains it
therefore covers all the Group's impacts, broken down into
four areas:

s innovating sustainably, which aims at improving the
environmental and social profile of products (see section
1.2.5);

s producing sustainably, to reduce the environmental
footprint of the Group’s plants and distribution centres, all
over the world (see section 1.2.6);

s_ living sustainably, to engage with consumers and offer
them the possibility to make sustainable consumption
choices;

s developing sustainably to share growth with all the Group’s
stakeholders (employees, suppliers, communities).

with suppliers

“By 2020, 100% of the Group's strategic suppliers will be participating in our supplier sustainability

programme."

L’‘Oréal considers that the activities of its suppliers are part of its
wider social and environmental footprint. This is why the Group
has decided to associate its suppliers with its social, ethical
and environmental commitments. This concerns first and
foremost its “strategic” suppliers, who represent over 80% of the
Group's direct purchases (raw materials, packaging and
subcontracting).

Following on from the responsible purchasing policy it has
implemented since 2002 known as the L’Oréal Buy & Care

82% of the Group’s strategic suppliers have been evaluated and
selected on the basis of their environmental and social
performance. They represent more than 74% of total direct purchases

(raw materials, packaging items and subcontracting) Furthermore,

in 2017, 1,231 social audits ” were carried out, making a total of over
9,400 since 2006.

programme, the Sharing Beauty With All programme has
enabled the Group to associate its suppliers more with its CSR
initiatives by developing a twofold approach:

s_ the supplier selection process now takes into consideration
their environmental and social performances;

s the Group makes available to them _ continuous
improvement tools to enable them to carry out a better
self-assessment and improve.

... with communities

"By 2020, the Group will enable more than 100,000 people from socially or financially deprived

communities to access work through its actions.”

Due to its large number of purchasing programmes and its
many industrial and administrative sites all over the world,
L’'Oréal makes a contribution to many local projects. As a
general rule, the Group's establishments and its subsidiaries
build good relationships with the communities in the areas in
which they operate, and make every effort to share their
growth.

This ambition led to a commitment in the Sharing Beauty With
All programme: enabling over 100,000 people from socially or

38 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT / L'OREAL 2017

financially deprived communities to access work by 2020. This
means that L'Oréal will support as many people outside the
Company as there are employees in the Group.

To achieve this target, L'Oréal has implemented various
programmes: professional training for people in highly
vulnerable situations, the inclusion of persons with disabilities
or the deployment of Solidarity Sourcing projects.
Solidarity Sourcing

n 2010, L’'Oréal created Solidarity Sourcing, a global
responsible purchasing programme which aims to open up
he Group's calls for tenders to companies that employ people
rom economically vulnerable communities in order to enable
hem to have durable access to work and to income, as well
as to companies that traditionally do not have access to the
large calls for tenders of multinational companies.

DEVELOPMENT

AN ORGANISATION THAT SERVES THE GROUP’S

The Group's organisation responds to a dual challenge: pursuing the strategy which has enabled
L’Oréal to be successful over the last century and at the same time inventing the new L’Oréal of the
21° century, perfectly matched to an ever-changing world.

1.4.1. L'OREALS.A.

L'Oréal S.A. is a French company, with its head office in
France. It performs a sales activity that is specific to France.
L’'Oréal parent company also functions as a holding company
and has a role of strategic coordination as well as scientific,
industrial and marketing coordination for the L'Oréal Group on
a global basis.

The Group’s subsidiaries develop the Group’s business in their
respective territory. To do so, they define the strategy specific
to their market, make the most suitable choices, and
manufacture, directly or indirectly, and market the products
they decide to sell on their market.

Almost all of the subsidiaries are owned by L’Oréal S.A, which
has a holding or control percentage equal or close to 100% “.
The detailed list of these subsidiaries is set out in the notes to
the consolidated and parent company financial statements.

1.4.2. OPERATIONAL DIVISIONS

The Group's business activities are organised into four
Operational Divisions. In its markets, each Operational Division
develops and enhances a range of its own brand of consumer
products.

s The Consumer Products Division's goal is to democratise
access to the best that the world of beauty has to offer.

Growth in this Division is underpinned by four major global
brands (L’Oréal Paris, Garnier, Maybelline New York and
NYX Professional Makeup Professional Makeup), and by the
deployment of its specialised and regional brands (Essie,
Niely, Dark and Lovely, etc.).

Across all Divisions and markets, digital resources are not
only an opportunity to leverage the enormous growth
acceleration potential inherent in e-commerce, but also a
chance to optimise the Division's marketing models.

s L'Oréal Luxe creates exceptional experiences and products,
for the most demanding consumers in selective distribution.

The Division has built a unique portfolio of prestigious
brands including iconic mainstream, — aspirational,
alternative and specialist brands (Lancéme, Yves Saint
Laurent Beauté, Giorgio Armani Beauty, Kiehl's, Urban
Decay, Biotherm, Ralph Lauren, IT Cosmetics).

Locally, digital resources mean we can offer L’'Oréal Luxe
customers an exceptional experience with inspiring
content, the opportunity to establish a personalised,
value-added relationship and an e-commerce strategy that
encapsulates each brand's particular added value.

s The Professional Products Division provides expertise to
beauty professionals

For over 100 years, this Division has acquired extensive
knowledge of, and provided tailored support solutions for,
the hairdressing sector. It has built up a unique brand
portfolio which currently includes L'Oréal Professionnel,
Kérastase, Redken, Matrix, Blolage, Pureology, Decléor and
Carita.

Digital resources are a powerful lever to reinvent the
professional beauty world and help transform the industry
by creating a direct and inspiring link between brands,
professionals and their customers in each market.

s_ The Active Cosmetics Division's goal is to help everyone in
heir quest to have healthy and beautiful skin.

Its portfolio of highly complementary brands (Vichy, La
Roche-Posay, SkinCeuticals, and Roger&Gallet) is designed
o keep pace with major skincare trends and
recommendations of healthcare professionals. The recent
acquisition of the US brand CeraVe has recently added to
his portfolio.

in its markets, the Division is developing or reinventing
dermocosmetics in all distribution channels, including
pharmacies, drugstores, branded retail, and e-commerce
sites. It is launching new products and services on the
recommendation and advice of health and beauty opinion
leaders and influencers, in retail outlets and on digital
platforms.

Travel Retailis a fast-growing channel that conveys the
Company's image and is increasing in line with passenger
numbers. By establishing the multi-Division Travel Retail
department, the Group aims to develop this segment
implementing a global shopper strategy: a bespoke approach
tailored according to language, culture and beauty rituals,
enabling the Group to respond to the aspirations of this new
generation of travellers.

INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

1.5.

The Group operates in a constantly changing environment
and like any company, L’Oréal is necessarily exposed to risks
which could have a negative impact for it if they were to
materialise.

In order to ensure the sustainability of its development and the
achievement of its objectives, the Group strives to anticipate
and manage the risks to which it is exposed in its different
areas of activity.

L'Oréal’s risk management consists in identifying, managing
and controlling risks that may affect the smooth running of the
Company. It also participates in value creation by promoting
the good use of resources to minimise the impact of negative
events and maximise the realisation of opportunities.

Risk management therefore goes beyond a strictly financial
framework.

By contributing to preventing and managing the risks to which
the Group is exposed, the purpose of the Internal Control
system is to enable the Group's industrial and economic
development to take place in a steady and sustainable
manner in a control environment appropriate for the Group’s
businesses.

INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

In L’'Oréal, Internal Control is a system that applies to the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and aims at
ensuring that:

s economic and financial targets are achieved in
compliance with the laws and regulations in force;

s_ the orientations set by General Management are followed;
s_ the Group’s assets are valued and protected;

s_ the Group’s financial and accounting information is reliable
and provides true and fair statements.

The control environment, which is critical to the Internal Control
system, good risk management and the application of
procedures, is based on people, behaviour and the
organisational structure. In L’Oréal, it forms part of a culture of
rigour and commitment communicated by — senior
management and is also in line with the Group’s strategic
choices.

Risk management and Internal Control are the affair of
everyone, from all the employees to the governance bodies.

The Internal Control system is the subject of ongoing
supervision in order to verify whether it is relevant and meets
the Group’s objectives and addresses its issues.
