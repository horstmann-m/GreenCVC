ended December 31, 2018. Upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, which met on February 12, 2019, the Supervisory Board, at its
meeting held on February 14, 2019, reviewed the Financial Report and the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended
December 31, 2018, as previously approved by the Management Board on February 11, 2019.

without qualified opinion. The statutory auditors’ report on the Consolidated Financial Statements is included in the preamble to the
Financial Statements.

1 Earnings analysis: group and business segments

Preliminary comments:

Change of accounting standards
In 2018, Vivendi applied two new accounting standards:

e IFRS 15 — Revenues from Contracts with Customers: in accordance with IFRS 15, Vivendi applied this change of accounting
standard to 2017 revenues, thereby ensuring comparability of the data relative to each period of 2018 and 2017 contained in this
report, and

e IFRS 9 — Financial Instruments: in accordance with IFRS 9, Vivendi applied this change of accounting standard to the 2018
Statement of Earnings, therefore, the data relative to 2017 contained in this report is not comparable.

For a detailed description, please refer to Notes 1 and 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Non-GAAP measures

“Income from operations”, “EBITA” and “adjusted net income”, all non-GAAP measures, should be considered in addition to, and not as a
substitute for, other GAAP measures of operating and financial performance as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the
related Notes, or as described in this Financial Report. Vivendi considers these to be relevant indicators for the group's operating and
financial performance.

Vivendi Management uses income from operations, EBITA and adjusted net income for reporting, management and planning purposes
because they exclude most non-recurring and non-operating items from the measurement of the business segments’ performances. Under
Vivendi's definition:
e — the difference between EBITA and EBIT consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations, the
impairment of goodwill and other intangibles acquired through business combinations, the income from equity affiliates
- operational, as well as other charges and income related to transactions with shareowners,
e income from operations is calculated as EBITA, as presented in the Adjusted Statement of Earnings, before share-based
compensation costs and special items, due to their unusual nature and particular significance; and
e adjusted net income includes the following items: EBITA, income from equity affiliates, interest (corresponding to interest expense
on borrowings net of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents); income from investments (including dividends and
interest received from unconsolidated companies), and taxes and non-controlling interests related to these items. It does not include
the following items: amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations and related to equity affiliates,
impairment losses on goodwill and other intangible assets acquired through business combinations, other charges and income
related to transactions with shareowners, other financial charges and income, earnings from discontinued operations, provisions for
income taxes and adjustments attributable to non-controlling interests, non-recurring tax items (in particular the changes in deferred
tax assets pursuant to Vivendi SA's Tax Group and the Consolidated Global Profit Tax Systems and the reversal of tax liabilities
related to risks extinguished over the period).

Moreover, it should be noted that other companies may have definitions and calculations for these non-GAAP measures that differ from
those used by Vivendi, thereby affecting comparability.

e income from equity affiliates — operational, which was a profit of €7 million, compared to a profit of €146 million in 2017. This
decrease of €139 million resulted from the reclassification in 2018 of Vivendi's share of Telecom Italia’s net earnings (€122 million)
in “income from equity affiliates - non-operational”, to account for the decrease of Vivendi's influence over Telecom Italia in 2018
(please refer below and to Note 11.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018). In 2017, this
amount primarily included Vivendi’s share of Telecom Italia’s net earnings, calculated based on the financial information publicly
disclosed by Telecom Italia, which represented a profit of €144 million.

1.2.3 Income from equity affiliates - non-operational

Income from equity affiliates - non-operational amounted to a profit of €122 million, compared to nil in 2017. In 2018, this amount
related to Vivendi's share of Telecom Italia’s net earnings, calculated based on the financial information publicly disclosed by Telecom
Italia’. In 2017, the share of Telecom Italia’s net earnings (€144 million) was recorded as “income from equity affiliates - operational” (please
refer above and to Note 11.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018).

1.24 Financial results

In 2018, interest was an expense of €47 million (compared to €53 million in 2017). In this amount:

e interest expense on borrowings amounted to €64 million, compared to €68 million in 2017. This change notably reflected the
decrease in the average interest rate on borrowings to 1.39% (compared to 1.60% in 2017), partially offset by the increase in the
average outstanding borrowings to €4.6 billion (compared to €4.3 billion in 2017); and

e interest income earned on the investment of cash surpluses amounted to €17 million, compared to €15 million in 2017. This change
reflected the increase in the average interest rate on cash investments to 0.50% (compared to 0.40% in 2017), partially offset by the
decrease in the average outstanding cash investments to €3.4 billion (compared to €3.7 billion in 2017).

Income from investments amounted to €20 million, compared to €29 million in 2017. This amount mainly included dividends received from
elefonica of €11 million (compared to €20 million in 2017), as well as the interest from the bonds issued by Banijay Group Holding and Lov
Banijay and subscribed to by Vivendi for €6 million (compared to €7 million in 2017).

Other financial charges and income were a net charge of €763 million, compared to a net charge of €100 million in 2017. In 2018, other
inancial charges included the write-down of the value of the Telecom Italia shares accounted for under the equity method, for
€1,066 million. Notwithstanding Vivendi’s expected improvement of Telecom Italia’s outlook, Vivendi wrote-down the value of its interest in
elecom Italia accounted for under the equity method notably to take into account the uncertainty affecting Telecom Italia’s governance,
which increases the non-execution risks associated with the company’s industrial plan given Vivendi’s lower power to participate in Telecom
italia's financial and operating policy decisions, and to take into account the changes in Telecom Italia's competitive and regulatory
environment. Other financial income included the revaluation between January 1 and December 31, 2018 of the interests in Spotify and
encent Music for an aggregate amount of €312 million, as well as in Ubisoft for €53 million, reported to profit or loss in accordance with
the new accounting standard IFRS 9, applicable since January 1, 2018.

in 2018, Vivendi realized a capital gain of €1,213 million on the sale of its interest in Ubisoft. Of this amount, only the portion corresponding
to the revaluation of such interest in 2018 (€53 million) was recorded in the Statement of Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018, in
accordance with the new IFRS 9 accounting standard, applicable since January 1, 2018. The remaining portion of the capital gain
{€1,160 million) related to the revaluation of such interest up until December 31, 2017, was recorded in “charges and income directly
recognized in equity” as of December 31, 2017, in accordance with the former IAS 39 accounting standard, and reclassified as retained
earnings as of January 1, 2018 as a result of the first-time application of IFRS 9. Under IAS 39, which was applicable up until December 31,
2017, it would have been reported to profit or loss.

1.2.5 Provision for income taxes

In 2018, provision for income taxes reported to adjusted net income was a net charge of €253 million, compared to a net income of
€195 million in 2017, representing an unfavorable change of €448 million. In 2017, the tax net income reported to adjusted net income
notably included (i) a current tax income of €409 million recorded following the litigation relating to the Consolidated Global Profit Tax
System of 2011, where Vivendi SA secured a favorable settlement, and (ii) the current tax income of €25 million, corresponding to
moratorium interest, relating to the refund to Vivendi SA and its subsidiaries of the amounts paid under the 3% tax on dividend distributions,
following the decision of the French Constitutional Council dated October 6, 2017, where it was ruled that this tax contribution was
unconstitutional (please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018).

° On November 8, 2018 (Financial Statements for the first nine months of 2018) and on March 6, 2018 (Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017): please refer
to Note 11.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Excluding these two non-recurring favorable impacts, provision for income taxes reported to adjusted net income in 2017 would have been a
net charge of €239 million, compared to a net charge of €253 million in 2018, i.e., an unfavorable change of €14 million. This change mainly
reflected the increase in the tax charges of Universal Music Group and Canal+ Group, partially offset by the increase in current tax savings
rom Vivendi’s Tax Group System in France. In 2018, the growth in Universal Music Group's taxable income in the United States resulted in a
ederal tax charge of €48 million, which reflected the impact of the tax reform applicable from January 1, 2018. In 2017, the federal tax
charge was nil, taking into account the current tax savings resulting from the utilization of the tax losses carried forward in the United States
{€96 million). The growth in Canal+ Group's taxable income primarily resulted from the recovery of its businesses in France. The increase in
current tax savings from Vivendi’s Tax Group System in France in 2018 (€168 million, compared to €86 million in 2017) notably resulted from
the integration of Havas and its subsidiaries as from January 1, 2018.

n 2018, the effective tax rate reported to adjusted net income amounted to 20.1%, compared to 25.3% in 2017 restated from the two
non-recurring favorable impacts. This decrease of approximately 5 points in the effective tax rate reported to adjusted net income mainly
reflected the increase in 2018 of the current tax savings from Vivendi’s Tax Group System in France, as well as the decrease in the federal
tax rate in the United States, while unutilized tax losses generated by businesses under development were almost stable.

n 2018, provision for income taxes reported to net income was a net charge of €357 million, compared to a net income of €355 million
in 2017. In 2017, the tax net income reported to net income notably included (i) a current tax income of €409 million recorded following the
itigation relating to the Consolidated Global Profit Tax System of 2011, where Vivendi SA secured a favorable settlement, as well as (ii) a
current tax income of €243 million corresponding to the refund to Vivendi SA (€207 million principal and €24 million moratorium interest) and
to its subsidiaries (€11 million principal and €1 million moratorium interest) of the amounts paid under the 3% tax on dividend distributions,
‘ollowing the decision of the French Constitutional Council dated October 6, 2017, where it was ruled that this tax contribution was
unconstitutional (please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018).

Excluding the two non-recurring favorable impacts, the provision for income taxes reported to net income in 2017 would have been a net
charge of €297 million, compared to a net charge of €357 million in 2018, i.e., an unfavorable change of €60 million. In addition to the
explanatory reasons for the increase in the tax charge reported to adjusted net income, in 2018, this increase in the tax charge reported to
net income included, the deferred tax charge relating to the revaluation through profit or loss of the interests in Spotify and Tencent Music
‘or an aggregate amount of -€72 million, in accordance with the new accounting standard IFRS 9, applicable since January 1, 2018. In 2017,
provision for income taxes also included a net deferred tax income of €79 million following the change of the corporate federal tax rate
applicable in the United States since January 1, 2018. This also included a deferred tax charge of -€119 million corresponding to the write-
off of deferred tax assets related to losses carried forward by Havas, primarily in France. In addition, the deferred tax savings relating to
Vivendi SA's Tax Group System were almost stable (a charge of €2 million in 2018, compared to an income of €3 million in 2017).

1.2.6 Non-controlling interests

In 2018, earnings attributable to non-controlling interests amounted to €30 million, compared to €33 million in 2017. They mainly
included the non-controlling interests of nc+ in Poland, Canal+ International and VTV in Vietnam.

1.2.7 Earnings attributable to Vivendi SA shareowners

In 2018, earnings attributable to Vivendi SA shareowners amounted to a profit of €127 million (or €0.10 per share - basic), compared to
€1,216 million in 2017 (or €0.97 per share - basic), a decrease of €1,089 million (-89.6%). In 2018, the increase in EBIT (+€164 million) and the
revaluation between January 1 and December 31, 2018 of the interests in Spotify, Tencent Music and Ubisoft for an aggregate amount of
+€365 million, were offset by the write-down of the Telecom Italia shares accounted for under the equity method (-€1,066 million) and the
increase in provision for income taxes (-€712 million). In 2017, the tax net income reported to adjusted net income notably included a current
tax income of €409 million recorded following the litigation relating to the Consolidated Global Profit Tax System of 2011, where Vivendi SA
secured a favorable settlement. This also included the current tax income of €243 million (including €25 million of moratorium interest)
relating to the refund received by Vivendi SA and its subsidiaries of the amounts paid under the 3% tax on dividend distributions. Excluding
these two non-recurring favorable tax impacts, the net income would have been a profit of €564 million in 2017.

Thursday February 14, 2019

in 2018, Canal+ Group's revenues amounted to €5,166 million, almost stable compared to 2017 (-0.3% at constant currency and perimeter).

At the end of December 2018, Canal+ Group's overall subscriber portfolio (individual and collective subscribers in France and internationally)
stood at 16.2 million, compared to 15.6 million at the end of December 2017, representing net growth of 654,000 subscribers.

Revenues from television operations in mainland France decreased slightly (-3.4% at constant currency and perimeter) due to the decline in
the individual subscriber base (7.8 million, compared to 8.1 million at the end of December 2017), despite a positive change in the churn rate,
which decreased by 2.2 points over the year to 13.6%. This decline was due in particular to the drop in Canalplay's subscriber base and the
termination of the Canalsat offer in favor of the new Canal offers and subscriptions via wholesale partnerships with telecom operators.

However, the Canal+ channel's individual subscriber base recorded a net year-on-year increase in subscribers of 251,000. Including collective
subscriptions, the total subscriber portfolio in mainland France reached 8.3 million.

International operations delivered a strong increase in revenues of 6.8% at constant currency and perimeter, primarily due to the very strong
growth in the individual subscriber base (+883,000 year-on-year) to which all the territories contributed, without exception.

Studiocanal’s revenues amounted to €462 million, a slight year-on-year decrease (-0.6% at constant currency and perimeter) due to an
unfavorable 2017 comparable basis (particularly with the worldwide success of Paddington 2) and despite significant growth in TV
operations and increased catalog revenues.

In France, Studiocanal was the second largest French film distributor in 2018 with more than 10 million theater tickets sold, thanks in
particular to the success of Sink or Swim (4.3 million tickets sold), Mia and the White Lion (1.4 million tickets sold), and In Safe Hands
{0.8 million tickets sold) during the fourth quarter.

in 2018, Canal+ Group's profitability increased sharply compared to 2017. Income from operations amounted to €429 million, compared to
€349 million in 2017 (+22.4% at constant currency and perimeter).

EBITA before restructuring charges amounted to €428 million, up nearly €80 million year-on-year. EBITA after restructuring charges
amounted to €400 million, compared to €300 million in 2017 (+32.8% at constant currency and perimeter). This strong EBITA growth was
notably due to the cost savings plan initiated in 2016, the significant improvement in mainland France and sustained international
development.

On November 8, 2018, Canal+ Group announced the renewal of its agreement with the French cinema, extending until the end of 2022 a
istoric partnership of more than 30 years. This agreement was a prerequisite for the signing on December 21, 2018 of the new media
release chronology which protects and strengthens the unique position of Canal+ which can now offer new movies to its subscribers as early
as 6 months after their theatrical release.

n the fourth quarter of 2018, Canal+ Group also strengthened its sports offer, especially around football, with the acquisition of the
roadcasting rights in France for the English Premier League and in Poland for the Ekstraklasa. Canal+ Group is proud to have won the
exclusive rights in France for the Premier League, the most widely broadcast football league in the world. Canal+ will offer the 380 Premier
League matches on its channels and on myCANAL. The agreement covers three seasons (2019/2020, 2020/2021 and 2021/2022) and will
start in August 2019.

In addition, the acquisition of Moto GP's rights for the first time illustrates the group's desire to diversify its sports offer, in line with recent
developments in boxing and women's football.

Anew global distribution agreement entered into on November 14, 2018 with the TF1 Group allows all TF1 Group channels and related non-
inear services to be integrated into the Canal offers. The group had entered into a similar agreement with M6 Group in early 2018.

b. Net revenues correspond to Havas’s revenues less the pass-through costs rebilled to customers (please refer to Note 1.3.4.3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018)

Reflecting an excellent fourth quarter 2018, Havas’s revenues amounted to €693 million, up 6.5% at constant currency and perimeter.

revenues amounted to €2,195 million (compared to €2,259 million in 2017 pro forma), up 0.1% organically (+1.9% excluding the impact of
Arnold) and down 2.8% on an actual basis mainly due to negative currency effects.

With an organic growth of 2.7% in the second half of 2018, compared to -2.9% in the first half of 2018, Havas confirmed the net sequential
improvement in organic net revenue growth. All its businesses (creative, health and wellness and media) contributed to this upturn.

n 2018, Havas increased its profitability. Havas’s income from operations reached €258 million, compared to €254 million in 2017 (pro
‘orma), a +0.6-point increase in the income from operations/net revenues margin to 11.8%. EBITA amounted to €215 million, compared to
€212 million in 2017, representing an increase of +0.4 points in the EBITA/net revenues margin. EBITA before restructuring charges was up
3.8% compared to 2017 (+1.9% organically).

he North American agencies performed very well in the fourth quarter of 2018, thanks to Havas Media, Havas Health & You, Havas Edge
and Abernathy/AMO.

Business in Europe continued to show progress at the end of the year, supported once again by robust performances in France and in the
United Kingdom. In France, BETC, Havas Paris and Ekino/Fullsix agencies were the major contributors. The United Kingdom confirmed its
recovery driven by the excellent performance from the media businesses, and the continued dynamism of the healthcare communications
usiness at Havas Lynx and the creative business at Havas London. Italy continued to show steady growth, while performances from the
other European countries remained mixed.

Latin America confirmed its recovery, driven by the media businesses.

Asia-Pacific returned a slightly negative performance, penalized by Australia, while China and India both reported sustained growth.

Havas pursued its policy of targeted acquisitions, completing several acquisitions in 2018:

e Catch, the leading digital conversion rate optimization (CRO) specialist across Australia and New Zealand;

e  Deekeling Arndt Advisors (DAA), a leading German communications consultancy providing communicative support and political

In 2018, Gameloft's OTT revenues (sales of games on platforms such as Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon) which represents 72% of
Gameloft’s total revenues, were up 2.1% at constant currency. This increase partially offset the decline in the activity related to telecom
operators, which is structurally in decline due to the gradual replacement of traditional mobile phones by smartphones, and the decrease in
advertising sales. In 2018, Gameloft’s revenues amounted to €293 million, down 5.1% at constant currency and perimeter.

Gameloft released two new games on smartphones in 2018: Dungeon Hunter Champions and Asphalt 9: Legends, the latest opus of the
No.1 mobile racing franchise that has recorded more than 35 million downloads since its launch on July 26,2018 and was among
Gameloft’s Top 5 bestselling games in 2018.

Gameloft's catalogue (63% of 2018 revenues generated by its own franchises), including its bestselling games such as Disney Magic
Kingdoms, March of Empires, Dragon Mania Legends, Asphalt 8: Airborne and Asphalt 9: Legends, which accounted for 47% of Gameloft’s
total revenues in 2018, is particularly resilient.

In 2018, Gameloft’s income from operations amounted to €4 million, and EBITA amounted to €2 million, including restructuring charges for
€4 million.

a. Constant perimeter reflects the impacts of the acquisition of Paylogic (April 16, 2018) and the sale of Radionomy (August 17, 2017).

n 2018, Vivendi Village’s revenues amounted to €123 million, an increase of 12.6% (+ 11.5% at constant currency and perimeter) compared
to 2017.

icketing revenues amounted to €58 million, up 9.9% compared to 2017 following the acquisition of Paylogic in April 2018. Vivendi Village
now has a ticketing network with a strong presence in Continental Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States, which had a record
year with more than 20 million tickets sold.

Live activities, which encompass Olympia Production, festivals and venues in France and Africa, recorded revenues of €34 million, an
increase of 94.9% compared to 2017. Olympia Production recorded very strong growth with more than 1,100 shows. It has a diversified
portfolio of 32 artists (music and comedy) and four regional festivals in France (compared to two in 2017), including Garorock, one of the
country’s largest festivals with an attendance of 145,000 people, acquired at the end of 2018. L’Olympia enjoyed a very good year with
280 shows, its level of activity prior to November 2015.

in Africa, CanalOlympia, with 11 cinema and entertainment venues in eight countries at the end of 2018, is meeting the challenge of strong
demand for cinema: its average attendance rate (24%) is almost double that of France.

Vivendi Sports organized its first two events in 2018, le Tour de |'Espoir (a cycling race in Cameroon) and Jab&Vibes (a boxing competition in
Senegal).

Vivendi Village's income from operations amounted to a loss of €9 million in 2018, compared to a loss of €6 million in 2017. Excluding the
investments in Africa, income from operations was positive at €2 million. EBITA amounted to a loss of €9 million, compared to a loss of
€18 million in 2017.

1.3.7 New Initiatives

compared to 2017.

GVA is deploying a fiber network on the African continent, enabling major cities to benefit from very high-speed Internet services. In 2018,
GVA opened two locations in Gabon and Togo, and acquired a business in Congo. GVA is planning to make significant investments, which
will weigh on its profitability for the first few years of operation.

Since June 2017, Dailymotion has focused on premium content and has improved its video base. Its audience for premium content has
almost doubled in the space of a year, reaching 2.2 billion views at the end of 2018, compared to 1.2 billion at the end of 2017. This strategy
has enabled Dailymotion to enter into many partnerships with leading global publishers. In total, more than 300 agreements were concluded
in 2018, including 100 in the United States and dozens in territories where Dailymotion previously had little presence (Korea, Vietnam, India).
The audience in these new countries has grown significantly.

recorded in 2017.

Corporate's EBITA was a net charge of €123 million, compared to a net charge of €97 million in 2017, an unfavorable change of €26 million
mainly relating to the change in income from operations and an increase in restructuring charges.

2 Liquidity and capital resources

2.1 Liquidity and equity portfolio

Preliminary comments:

e The “Net Cash Position” and the “Financial Net Debt”, non-GAAP measures, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute
for, GAAP measures presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, as well as any other measure of indebtedness
reported in accordance with GAAP. Vivendi considers these to be relevant indicators of the group’s liquidity and capital resources.
Vivendi Management uses these indicators for reporting, management and planning purposes.

The Net Cash Position (and the Financial Net Debt) are calculated as follows:

i. cash and cash equivalents, as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, corresponding to cash in banks, money
market funds and bond funds, which satisfy ANC and AMF position expectations expressed in November 2018, and other highly
liquid short-term investments with initial maturities of generally three months or less, as required by IAS 7 (please refer to Note
1.3.5.11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018);

ii. cash management financial assets, included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position under “financial assets”, relating
to financial investments, that do not satisfy the criteria for classification as cash equivalents set forth in IAS 7, and, with respect to
money market funds, which satisfy ANC and AMF position expectations expressed in November 2018, and

iii. derivative financial instruments, net (assets and liabilities) where the underlying instruments are Financial Net Debt items, as well
as cash deposits securing borrowings included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position under “financial assets”,

less:

iv. value of borrowings at amortized cost.

e For a detailed description, please refer to Note 14 “Cash position” and to Note 19 “Borrowings and other financial liabilities and
financial risk management” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.

ursday February 14, 2019

As of December 31, 2018, Vivendi’s Net Cash Position amounted to €176 million, compared to a Financial Net Debt of -€2,340 million as of
December 31, 2017, an increase of €2,516 million. This favorable change was mainly attributable to the following items:

e a €1,580 million inflow as part of the sale of Vivendi’s 27.27% interest in Ubisoft at a price of €66 per share for an aggregate
consideration of €2.0 billion (including €1,511 million received on March 23, 2018, €69 million received on October 3, 2018 and
€429 million still to be received under the forward sale of the remainder of its interest which is expected to occur on March 5,
2019; please refer to Note 2.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018);

e a€373 million inflow as part of the sale on the market of the Telefonica shares held by Vivendi in November and December 2018;

e a €267 million inflow received on July 12, 2018 as part of the sale of Vivendi’s interest in Fnac Darty (please refer to Note 2.4 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018); and

e net cash provided by operating activities (after income tax paid) for €1,187 million.

These inflows were partially offset by the dividend paid by Vivendi on April 24, 2018 with respect to fiscal year 2017 for €568 million and net
capital expenditures for €341 million.

During the first quarter of 2019, the following events will impact the cash position:

e On January 31, 2019, Vivendi completed the acquisition of 100% of Editis's share capital, representing an €833 million outflow,
which includes the repayment of Editis’s debt (please refer to Note 2.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended
December 31, 2018);

e On February 11, 2019, pursuant to a decision of the Versailles Administrative Court of Appeal regarding the use of foreign tax
receivables by Vivendi for the payment of the tax income in respect of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, Vivendi received a
request for repayment from the tax authorities in the amount of €239 million. Vivendi has 30 days to satisfy this request (please
refer to Note 6.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018); and

e On March 5, 2019, Vivendi will receive €429 million under the forward sale of its remaining interest in Ubisoft (please refer to Note
2.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018).

2.1.2 Equity portfolio

As of December 31, 2018, Vivendi held a portfolio of listed non-controlling equity interests, including a receivable of €429 million on the
forward sale of its remaining interest in Ubisoft (please refer to Note 2.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended
December 31, 2018). As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate market value of this portfolio was approximately €3.9 billion (before taxes),
compared to €6.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 (which notably included the entire interest in Ubisoft, as well as the interests in Telefonica
and Fnac Darty): please refer to Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.

As of February 11, 2019 (the date of Vivendi’s Management Board meeting that approved the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year
ended December 31, 2018), the value of this portfolio was approximately €4.0 billion (before taxes).

2.2 Cash flow from operations analysis

Preliminary comment:

“Cash flow from operations” (CFFO) and “cash flow from operations after interest and taxes” (CFAIT), non-GAAP measures, should be
considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, other GAAP measures of operating and financial performance as presented in the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes or as described in this Financial Report. Vivendi considers these to be relevant
indicators of the group's operating and financial performance.

2.2.1 Changes in cash flow from operations (CFFO)

In 2018, cash flow from operations (CFFO) generated by the group's business segments amounted to €1,126 million (compared to
€989 million in 2017), a €137 million improvement. These amounts included capital expenditures (net) generated by the group’s business
segments for €341 million (compared to €259 million in 2017), a deterioration of -€82 million mainly at Universal Music Group (-€47 million)
and Canal+ Group (-€22 million). In 2018, cash flow from operations (CFFO) generated by the group's business segments, before capital
expenditures (net), amounted to €1,467 million (compared to €1,248 million in 2017), an improvement of €219 million. This change mainly
resulted from the strong operating performance of Universal Music Group (+€239 million), primarily driven by the growth in subscription
streaming services, as well as Canal+ Group's growth (+€43 million), partially offset by the decline of Havas (-€61 million), which resulted
from the consolidation of Havas as from the second half of 2017. Havas’s change in working capital is usually unfavorable in the first half,
due to the seasonality of cash generation. For the second half of 2018, cash flow from operations (CFFO) generated by Havas, before capital
expenditures (net), amounted to €356 million, compared to €329 million for the second half of 2017.

2.2.3. Changes in cash flow from operations after interest and income tax paid (CFAIT)

In 2018, cash flow from operations after interest and income tax paid (CFAIT) was an €822 million net inflow (compared to €1,346 million in
2017), a decrease of €524 million, primarily resulting from the unfavorable change in cash flow relating to income taxes.

In 2018, cash flow relating to income taxes was a €262 million net outflow (compared to a €471 million net inflow in 2017). In 2017, it
notably included (i) a €346 million inflow received on April 18, 2017 as part of the litigation settlement relating to the tax credits utilized by
Vivendi in fiscal year 2012, (ii) a €223 million inflow relating to the refund to Vivendi SA of the amounts paid with respect to the 3% tax on
dividend distributions following the decision of the French Constitutional Council, dated October 6, 2017, where it was ruled that the tax
contribution was unconstitutional, as well as (iii) a refund of tax installments paid in 2016 under the French Tax Group System for fiscal year
2016 (€136 million), and (iv) a €10 million inflow at Universal Music Group in the United Kingdom, relating to a litigation settlement.

In 2018, the financial activities generated a €42 million net outflow (compared to €114 million in 2017). In 2018, they mainly included net
interest paid (-€47 million, compared to -€53 million in 2017). In addition, cash generated by foreign exchange risk hedging instruments was
a +€13 million inflow, compared to a -€52 million outflow in 2017, notably due to the depreciation of the dollar (USD) against the euro.

year 2018, which will be submitted to the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting to be held on April 15, 2019 for approval. This dividend
