B.1 The Bilfinger Group

B.1.1 Business model

Bilfinger is an internationally active industrial services provider. The objective of our business
activities is to enhance the efficiency of plants in the processing industry, to secure high availability,
to lower emissions and to reduce maintenance costs. In this context, the organization of custom-
ers’ sustainable production processes is becoming increasingly important. Bilfinger’s portfolio co-
vers the value chain from consulting, engineering, manufacturing, construction and maintenance
through to the expansion of plants and turnarounds. Services also include environmental technol-
ogies and digital applications.

B.1.2 Legal form and management

Bilfinger SE is a stock company in accordance with European law (Societas Europaea — SE). In
addition to German stock corporation law, it is also subject to special European SE regulations and
the German law on implementing a European Company as well as the German SE Employee
Involvement Act. The management bodies of the company are the Executive Board, the Supervi-
sory Board and the Annual General Meeting.

The Executive Board of Bilfinger SE manages the company in its own responsibility. The Super-
visory Board appoints, supervises and advises the Executive Board and is directly involved in key
decisions affecting the company. These bodies work in close cooperation for the benefit of Bilfin-
ger. Details are described in Chapter A.4.1 Declaration of corporate governance and corporate

governance report*, which is also available on the Internet site www.bilfinger.com.

B.1.3. Organization, strategy and objectives

Bilfinger SE is a holding company without its own business activities. The operating activities are
organized decentrally and are carried out through subsidiaries which operate on the market as
independent profit centers. The operating companies are divided into regions or divisions which
in turn are each a part of one of the reporting segments.

The operating companies deliver their services for the most part in customers’ plants. The
business processes are therefore largely organized in a decentralized manner and this also applies
to sales structures and procurement markets. In order to continuously improve process and cost
efficiency, Bilfinger implements general business development concepts in relevant positions in
the sales area. Central instruments also play an important role in procurement. Such instruments
include the bundling of buying processes and the use of e-procurement platforms.

Input factors for the business are quantified in Chapter 8.2.4 Financial position — origin and
distribution of value creation. With a comprehensive range of services for plants in the process
industry, an organizational structure that is aligned with the needs of our customers and the focus

on defined customer industries, the foundation for the successful development of the company is
created. Information on research and development activities is included in Chapter 8.2.7 Innova-
tion (research and development report).

Bilfinger reports on business development in 2021 in the three segments Engineering & Mainte-
nance Europe, Engineering & Maintenance International and Technologies. The range of services
in the two Engineering & Maintenance segments is offered locally and includes services for the
maintenance, engineering, extension, new construction and operation of industrial plants — all
from a single source. While the majority of revenue in the Engineering & Maintenance business is
generated from service and framework agreements, the Technologies segment is almost entirely
dominated by project orders. The most important pillars are projects and components for the nu-
clear industry and biopharmaceutical plants.

Engineering & Maintenance Europe

The operational Engineering & Maintenance business in Europe is divided into six regions. Com-
bined reporting in one segment is carried out due to the similarity of the markets, the economic
environment as well as the financial parameters — especially growth expectations and the size of
margins.

Engineering & Maintenance International

The activities of the North America and Middle East regions form the Engineering & Maintenance
International reporting segment. The grouping in one segment is based on the specific market
conditions, economic environment and financial parameters in the regions outside Europe.

Technologies

Activities in the Technologies segment are positioned globally and there is a Group-wide coordi-
nation of market development. The range of products and services offered by the prevailing pro-
ject business is characterized by technological expertise in the nuclear and biopharmaceutical mar-
kets, both of which are growth areas for the Group.

Other Operations

Bilfinger reports on operating units that are active outside the defined business segments, regions
and industries under Other Operations. These units are not part of the strategic regional and tech-
nological positioning of the Group; they will be managed independently for value until a suitable
owner has been found. Other Operations consisted of three individual entities as of January 1,
2021. The selling process for one of these companies was completed in the course of 2021 so that
two companies remain in Other Operations at the end of the year.

B.1.4 Financial management system

The key financial management metrics for financial year 2021 include figures for growth, profita-
bility, capital efficiency as well as for liquidity and capital structure. Revenue, EBITA, adjusted
EBITA, return on capital employed (ROCE) and free cash flow serve as the most important key
figures for financial management.

B.1.4.1 Growth

Revenue

Profitable and sustainable organic revenue growth is a cornerstone of the strategy for increasing
Bilfinger’s enterprise value. In addition, targeted acquisitions can contribute to the growth in vol-
ume.

Revenue planning is conducted on the basis of orders received and order backlog; both key
figures represent early indicators for revenue. For projects, the entire contract volume after sign-
ing is recognized; for framework agreements without a guaranteed volume, expected revenue for
the coming 12 months on a rolling basis is booked in orders received and order backlog.

B1 The Bilfinger Group

B.1.4.2 Profitability
EBITA / adjusted EBITA
The indicator of operating profit of the corporate units and of the Group, and thus the measure of
earnings for segment reporting, is ‘earnings before interest, taxes and amortization’ (EBITA).
Against the background of the ongoing transformation process, Bilfinger continues to focus on
‘adjusted EBITA’ — or EBITA adjusted for special items — in financial year 2021. For better compa-
rability of operating performance over time, special items are eliminated. These include gains on
disposals, restructuring measures as well as expenses in connection with the further development
of the IT landscape and the compliance system. In view of the advanced stage of the transfor-
mation, these special items declined as planned in financial year 2021, so that from financial year
2022 onwards reported EBITA will serve as the primary measure of operating profit.

Net profit
Net profit consists of operating profit plus / minus amortization of intangible assets from acquisi-
tions, financial income and expense and taxes. Also with regard to net profit we made reference
to adjusted net profit in the reporting year with adjustments made for the above-mentioned spe-
cial items as well as for amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions. In addition, a normal-
ized tax rate is assumed here.

When it comes to net profit, as is the case with EBITA, we will also consider the reported figure
as the main indicator from financial year 2022.

B.1.4.3 Capital efficiency

Free cash flow / adjusted free cash flow / net working capital

To facilitate the operationalization of value-oriented management, Bilfinger orients itself on free
cash flow. Free cash flow is calculated on the basis of cash flow from operating activities less net
investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. A major factor to be consid-
ered in this regard is the change in net working capital. Net working capital is calculated as the
difference between current assets excluding cash and cash equivalents and current liabilities ex-
cluding financial debt. A reduction in net working capital leads to lower capital employed and thus
also contributes toward an increase in the return on capital employed (ROCE) and in the value
added by the business segment concerned.

Also in the reporting year, adjusted free cash flow was considered at Group level. As described
above, it is calculated on the basis of cash inflow from operating activities less net investment in
property, plant and equipment under adjustment for special items. These special items logically
correspond to the approach taken in EBITA.

Investments

Although compared with some industries the Group’s business is not very capital intensive,
planned additions to property, plant and equipment are subject to intensive investment control-
ling.

B.1.4.4 Value enhancement

Value added and ROCE

The value added by the reporting segments and the Group is measured with the help of value and
cash-oriented management. Bilfinger employs its capital in a targeted manner in order to achieve


--- Page 6 ---

Bilfinger SE
Annual Report 2021,

B_ Combined management report 57
B1 The Bilfinger Group

significant value added. Positive value added is only achieved for the Group if the return on aver-
age capital employed (ROCE) is higher than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). These
figures are calculated after taxes. Further details are provided in Chapter 8.2.2 Results of opera-
tions - Value added. The underlying parameters are regularly reviewed and adjusted in the case of
relevant changes in the market environment.

B.1.4.5 Capital structure and liquidity

Net debt and dynamic gearing ratio

To manage liquidity, Bilfinger focuses on the important key figures net debt and the dynamic debt
ratio, which also includes net debt as relates to EBITDA (EBITA plus depreciation and amortization
on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets).

Note on pro-forma key figures / alternative performance measures

As explained, in addition to the key performance indicators prepared in accordance with IFRS,
Bilfinger also reports pro-forma key figures. These alternative performance measures include re-
ported EBITA, adjusted EBITA, EBITA margin, adjusted EBITA margin, adjusted earnings per share,
adjusted net profit, adjusted cash flow from operating activities and adjusted free cash flow. They
are not within the scope of, and are not subject to, financial reporting requirements.

Pro-forma key figures are to be seen as a supplement, but not as a substitute for the disclosures
required by IFRS and are based on the definitions set out in this Annual Report. They are used for
management purposes because they are based on purely operational development and therefore
offer a considerable degree of transparency as relates to the actual business development of the
Group. At the same time, a perspective that includes special items is also reported

The quantitative reconciliation of the special items in the earnings key figures is explained in
Chapter 8.2.2 Results of operations; the quantitative reconciliation of the special items in cash flow
figures is explained in Chapter 8.2.4 Financial position

Other companies may calculate these key figures differently.

* The outlook for Engineering & Maintenance International was adjusted on November 11, 2021 in the course of reporting on the third quarter of 2021. Because progress in volumes and project execution in
North America was slower than expected, an improvement compared with the prior year was still expected, although at a negative level. This adjustment had no impact on the Group's overall outlook
because the the decrease at Engineering & Maintenance International was offset by positive developments in the other segments.

Due to rounding, individual figures may not add up exactly to the totals given and percentages presented may not precisely reflect the absolute values to which they relate.

With the figures achieved in 2021, Bilfinger again delivered on its full-year outlook and has thus

left behind the years of transition and major restructuring.

On the heels of the restrictions inflicted in the previous year by the COVID-19 pandemic and

the volatile development of the oil price, business recovered as expected in the reporting year. We

saw especially profitable growth in our engineering and maintenance activities in our European

markets and in our nuclear and biopharmaceuticals businesses.

At the end of the year we met or even exceeded the forecasts made in the Annual Report 2020

and the 2021 half-year report, supported by one-time effects: Net income, free cash flow and

return on capital employed (ROCE) were higher than initially forecast. There was an adverse devi-

Bilfinger SE
Annual Report 2021,

B_ Combined management report 59
B.2. Economic report

ation from our forecast in the Engineering & Maintenance International segment, where the earn-
ings forecast was adjusted in November 2021. As progress in volumes and project execution in
North America was slower than expected, an improvement on the prior year was still expected,
albeit with a continuing negative figure. This adjustment had no impact on the Group’s overall
earnings forecast as the decline at Engineering & Maintenance International was offset by positive
developments in the other segments.

Bilfinger again made significant progress toward achieving its set strategic imperatives in finan-
cial year 2021. The measures already introduced over the longer term to reduce costs and enhance
agility have taken effect. As a result, we achieved an increase in capacity utilization and, subse-
quently, a significant improvement in our gross margin. There were positive contributions to EBITA
in all four quarters of the financial year. This applies to both the adjusted and reported figures and
is a clear indication that the measures taken to reduce the seasonality of earnings development
are proving successful. The working capital position was also further improved. Implementation of
harmonized Group-wide processes and systems was also largely completed.

In addition, the Executive and Supervisory Boards are pursuing a balanced and shareholder-
friendly approach in the use of available financial resources, including the inflow of €458.4 million
from the resale of Apleona, which remains in line with Bilfinger’s long-standing financial policy. In
October 2021, we repaid the variable-interest tranches of outstanding promissory note loans in
the amount of €108.5 million ahead of schedule. These would have been due in April 2022. Fur-
thermore, the Executive and Supervisory Boards will propose to the Annual General Meeting in
May 2022 an additional distribution of €3.75 per share from Bilfinger SE’s unappropriated net
profit in addition to the regular dividend for the 2021 financial year. This corresponds to an addi-
tional dividend payout of approximately €150 million. Moreover, the Executive Board intends to
propose to the Supervisory Board a share buyback program with a volume of up to €100 million
from summer 2022. The basis for this step is a corresponding authorization that will also be put to
the vote at the Annual General Meeting in May 2022.

The sound balance sheet and the expected positive free cash flow in the coming years will
make it possible to invest several hundred million euros in organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions
to strengthen the Group’s market positions, particularly in attractive sectors and regions.

One focus in 2021 was the further development of Bilfinger’s sustainability strategy. The Group
has been reporting its carbon footprint for Scope 1 and Scope 2 in accordance with the Green-
house Gas Protocol since financial year 2021. In addition, we have set the goal of achieving a ‘net
zero’ value in these categories by 2030 at the latest. We also see significant growth potential for
our activities that help customers reduce their energy consumption and emissions with our sus-
tainable industrial services.

As expected, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Bilfinger’s markets and business activi-
ties diminished significantly in the reporting year. The respective developments are presented in
detail, specifically in Chapters 8.2.1.1 Economic environment, B.2.2 Results of operations, B.2.4 Fi-

nancial position and B.2.3 Net assets as well as in Chapter 8.3 Opportunity and risk report and in

Chapter 8.4 Outlook. Government grants received in financial year 2021 (in accordance with IAS

20) are described in Chapter C.6.3.2 Government grants and other measures in connection with

the COVID-19 pandemic.

Business development
Orders received for Bilfinger Group in 2021 increased by 8 percent (organically 9 percent) to
€4,007.8 million (previous year: €3,724 million), thus exceeding the €4 billion mark. This was


--- Page 9 ---

Bilfinger SE
Annual Report 2021,

B_ Combined management report 60
B.2. Economic report

mainly due to good demand in our European markets. The order backlog grew organically by
12.2 percent to €2,946.3 million (previous year: €2,584.7 million), while the book-to-bill ratio of
1.07 underpins Bilfinger’s growth ambitions for 2022.

Group revenue grew by 8 percent (organically 11 percent) to €3,737.4 million (previous year:
€3,461.0 million). The gross margin improved to 10.4 percent (previous year: 8.6 percent), as did
gross profit, which grew significantly to €387.0 million from a low level (previous year: €296.1 mil-
lion). Despite top-line growth, adjusted SG&A expenses remained in the prior-year range at
€285.6 million (previous year: €291.3 million). They were thus below the expected run rate of ap-
proximately €300 million, due also to one-time effects such as lower travel expenses because of
COVID-19. The adjusted SG&A ratio measured against revenue was 7.6 percent (previous year:
8.4 percent)

Bilfinger increased adjusted EBITA in 2021 to €137.2 million (previous year: €19.8 million),
which corresponds to an adjusted EBITA margin of 3.7 percent (previous year: 0.6 percent). A gain
of €30.4 million from non-operational real estate disposals contributed to this improvement. Re-
ported EBITA amounted to €121.2 million (previous year: -€57 million) after adjustments of -
€16 million (prior year: -€76.8 million)

At Engineering & Maintenance (E&M) Europe, orders received increased by 4 percent (organ-
ically 3 percent) to €2,552 million (previous year: €2,449.0 million). Revenue increased by 13 per-
cent (organically 12 percent) to €2,517.7 million (previous year: €2,220.6 million) and the book-
to-bill ratio was above 1. The segment’s adjusted EBITA improved to €130.7 million (previous year:
€68.9 million), which corresponds to an EBITA margin of 5.2 percent (previous year: 3.1 percent).
This reflects the progress made in improving the sales mix as well as further increasing the utiliza-
tion rate.

Orders received at E&M International increased by 44 percent (organically 48 percent) to
€633.9 million (previous year: €440.6 million). Revenue grew by 6 percent (organically 10 percent)
to €553.3 million (previous year: €521.2 million). Adjusted EBITA remained negative at -€13.9 mil-
lion (previous year: -€20.8 million) but with a positive result in the fourth quarter. Here, better
capacity utilization and strategic progress toward increasing the share of service contracts as well
as small and mid-sized projects are showing some effects. The adjusted EBITA margin was -2.5
percent (previous year: -4.0 percent).

In Technologies, orders received decreased by 17 percent (organically -16 percent) to €596.8
million (previous year: €718.8 million). The prior-year figure was largely supported by a higher
amount in call-off orders for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant project in the United King-
dom. A book-to-bill ratio clearly above 1 as well as order backlog growth of 10 percent are evidence
of the healthy demand experienced by this segment. Revenue increased by 12 percent (organically
14 percent) to €559.9 million (previous year: €498.0 million). The segment’s adjusted EBITA was
€20.3 million (previous year: -€10.5 million) and the adjusted EBITA margin improved to 3.6 per-
cent (previous year: -2.1 percent)

Net income increased to €129.5 million (previous year: €99.4 million), driven by the improve-
ment in EBITA and also supported by tax refunds in the amount of €46.2 million. Adjusted for
special items and with the application of a normalized tax rate, adjusted net profit improved to
€89.0 million (previous year: -€8.0 million)

This also had an impact on return on capital employed (ROCE), which improved to 7.4 percent
(previous year: 6.9 percent).

Free cash flow of €114.7 million (previous year: €93.2 million) made further progress compared
with 2020 despite a higher cash-out from special items and for investments. Cash inflows from tax

refunds, particularly in December, of in total €29.0 million contributed to this number. This was in
addition to inflows from real estate disposals of €56.6 million. Another major impact, however,
also came from the strong development of working capital in the last quarter of 2021, with 67 days
of sales outstanding (DSO) established as the new benchmark.

B.2.1.1 Economic environment

Economy as a whole

With strong growth of 5.2 percent in 2021, the euro zone economy was able to recover a substan-
tial share of the severe prior-year recession (-6.4 percent) (DG ECFIN, p. 154, Eurostat). The recov-
ery that began after the end of the hard lockdowns in the second quarter was driven by strong
government spending, by consumers eager to spend and by surprisingly dynamic global trade.
Business investment rose again strongly, increasing by 10.1 percent (DG ECFIN, p. 159). The up-
swing was, however, slowed by global supply bottlenecks, disruptions in international logistics
chains and soaring energy and intermediate product prices. In the course of this development,
there was a sharp rise in the euro inflation rate to over 4 percent.

The European Central Bank continued its highly expansionary approach with a zero interest
rate policy and extensive purchases of securities, citing what it sees as only temporary inflationary
pressures. Renewed high infection levels of the COVID-19 pandemic caused containment setbacks
in Europe in the fall and winter and renewed revenue losses in some particularly affected service
sectors. While the EU countries of Southern Europe have not yet been able to fully recover from
their particularly drastic economic crash of the previous year, economic output in Eastern Euro-
pean countries such as Poland and Hungary is already well above the 2019 level again.

Important German industrial sectors such as automotive and mechanical engineering were
particularly hard hit by supply bottlenecks, with the result that the recovery in Germany was com-
paratively weak, with GDP growth of 2.7 percent. Even though the recession in Germany caused
by COVID-19 was less severe in 2020 with -4.6 percent than the European Union average (-5.9
percent), it was still not possible to return to the pre-crisis level (DG ECFIN, p. 154). Outside the
European Union, the United Kingdom recovered more strongly with an increase of 6.9 percent,
but this was set against an extremely severe prior-year recession of -9.7 percent triggered by the
combination of Brexit and the pandemic, so that here, too, the pre-crisis level was not yet reached
(DG ECFIN, p. 154).

The USA experienced a much milder recession than Europe in the previous year (-3.4 percent,
DG ECFIN, p. 154) and recovered much more quickly from this slump. By the second quarter of
2021, economic activity was already back at pre-pandemic levels (DG ECFIN, p. 128). This was due
not only to the expansionary policy of the Federal Reserve, but also to massive additional govern-
ment spending through the American Rescue Plan. The government deficit was still 11 percent of
GDP in 2021. The rapid recovery, combined with high energy prices and global supply constraints,
pushed inflation up to 7 percent by December (BLS).

The broad upturn in the global economy was accompanied by a sweeping recovery in oil and
gas prices, which had been highly volatile in the previous year. After prices fell to levels of around
US$20 in May 2020, quotations of up to US$85 per barrel of Brent were reached again at times in
the course of 2021. The significantly higher average prices compared with the previous year have
enabled an economic recovery in the oil-producing countries of the Middle East. Following a GDP
contraction of 4.2 percent in the previous year, the region’s economic output likely grew again by
4.5 percent in the reporting year (WEO, p. 40).

Engineering & Maintenance Europe

The market for industrial services in Europe recovered well from the sharp downturn in the previ-
ous year. Projects that had initially been put on hold immediately after the outbreak of the COVID-
19 pandemic to avoid personal contact were increasingly made up for. In addition to these short-
term effects, development was boosted by a structural increase in demand for the wide range of
services in the context of the decarbonization of European industry. Even stronger growth in the
services markets was, however, prevented by supply bottlenecks which led to delays in major in-
vestment projects by industrial customers. Nevertheless, the slump in sales in the industrial ser-
vices sector in the previous year was largely offset. According to industry estimates, sales of all
suppliers in Germany expanded by 11 percent in 2021, after falling by 10 percent in the previous
year (Ltn, p. 13). The chemical and petrochemical sectors continued to slightly expand their role
as by far the most important customer group, with their share of the German market for industrial
services now estimated at 46 percent (Lin, p. 73)

The European chemical sector benefited greatly from the strong recovery in the global indus-
trial economy. However, despite a significantly improved order situation, production was also no-
ticeably hampered by disruptions in supply chains. At mid-year, 50 percent of the companies sur-
veyed by the German Chemical Industry Association (VCI) reported severe disruptions in opera-
tions due to bottlenecks in supply chains and logistics (VCl member survey). Among the customer
sectors of the chemical industry, the automotive industry in particular was adversely affected by
the prevailing chip shortage and had to sharply curtail its production and thus also purchases of
precursors.

Despite these frictions, chemical production in Europe expanded by 9.4 percent year-on-year
from January to November 2021 (VCI WCR). The recovery in chemical production was often a mir-
ror image of the previous year’s development. Where there had been particularly sharp declines
in 2020 due to especially extensive lockdowns, there were particularly significant increases in
2021. Once again, the Eastern European sites recorded the strongest momentum. Chemical pro-
duction in Poland was up 13 percent year-on-year in the year to November, with the extensive
expansion investments of recent years having an impact here (VCI WCR).

Following a situation characterized by oversupply and a drastic fall in prices in the previous
year, the oil and gas sector in the United Kingdom and Norway saw the reverse, with supply short-
ages and very sharp price increases in the reporting year. Surprisingly rapid growth in demand for
liquefied natural gas, particularly in Asia, low inventories following a cold winter and unfavorable
offshore wind conditions led to significant distortions on the gas markets, especially in the United
Kingdom, with the result that prices for natural gas increased more than fivefold from the start of
the year to their peak in October (Trading Economics Gas). Despite rising prices triggered by pan-
demic-related production cuts, oil and gas production fell even more sharply than in the previous
year, dropping from a combined 87 million tons in the previous year to 73 million tons of oil equiv-
alent (UK Oil & Gas Authority PEP). At the same time, the high prices caused the profitability of oil
and gas producers to rise surprisingly strongly at average production costs of US$14 per barrel (UK
Oil & Gas Authority PEP). This development stabilized the industry's capital expenditure for oper-
ating expenses and for decommissioning, which recovered slightly year-on-year from GBP 11.3
billion to GBP 11.8 billion. However, this level was still significantly below the 2019 figure of GBP
14.1 billion (UK Oil & Gas Authority PEP). Exploration and exploratory drilling expenditures are also
still more than 50 percent below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels; a further significant decline in
production is expected in the coming years. Unlike in the UK fields, production volumes in the

B.2. Economic report

Norwegian Shelf have remained constant. The higher-than-expected production capacity of the
Johan Sverdrup field, which went into production in 2019, has contributed significantly to this sta-
ble development (Norwegian Petroleum).

During the reporting year, the energy and utilities industry was characterized by agreement on
more ambitious national, European and global climate policy targets. This development further
increased the pressure toward increased energy efficiency and the reduction of fossil energy in
industry and power generation. In Germany, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the Cli-
mate Protection Act of December 2019 was unconstitutional because the reduction targets for
greenhouse gas emissions were too vague (Bundesverfassungsgericht). The German government
responded to this ruling by amending the Climate Protection Act to make reduction targets more
precise and bring them forward. Accordingly, emissions must fall by 65 percent by 2030 compared
to 1990; previously, a reduction target of 55 percent applied. Germany is now expected to achieve
climate neutrality by 2045, compared with the previous target of 2050 (German government).
With a new emergency program worth €8 billion, the German government has made funds avail-
able for decarbonizing industry and for green hydrogen, among other things.

The tightening of Germany’s emissions targets should also be seen as a response to stricter EU
climate targets. The European Parliament and the Council finally agreed on a new EU emissions
target under which climate-damaging emissions are to be reduced by at least 55 percent by 2030
(previously a reduction target of 40 percent applied) (Handelsblatt EU climate target).

In November, the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow committed to the objective of
limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. The nearly 200 countries participating in the Paris Climate
Agreement have committed to tightening their previously inadequate climate protection targets
by the end of 2022 (COP26).

With climate policy that is particularly ambitious in Europe and North America, there is growing
potential for the industrial services market in the area of energy transformation. In Europe, carbon
reduction is also becoming increasingly economical due to the planned increase in the carbon
emission price. Prices in the European emissions trading system, for example, increased very
sharply in the reporting year from an average of €24.7 per metric ton of CO, in 2020 to more than
€80 at the end of 2021, thus reaching historic highs (BDEW, p. 46, Trading Economics Carbon). The
average electricity price for industrial customers rose from 17.8 ct/kWh in the previous year to
19.1 ct/kWh on average for the year (BDEW, p. 26), with a particularly sharp price spike at the end
of the year.

Engineering & Maintenance International

In the USA, prospects for CO2 reduction projects in industry and the energy sector have greatly
improved again since the Biden administration took office and the USA returned to the Paris Cli-
mate Agreement. This about-face in U.S. climate policy has further strengthened U.S. industry's
willingness to invest in renewables-based power generation, energy storage and greater energy
efficiency.

In the USA, developments in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries varied. The pharma-
ceutical industry developed very dynamically with an increase of 10.8 percent, benefiting strongly
from high demand for vaccines and other pharmaceutical products in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic. By contrast, production growth in the chemical industry was subdued with an increase
of 1.5 percent from January to November (VCI WCR). In addition to global supply bottlenecks, U.S.
production was hampered by the winter storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Stronger positive demand

impetus came from dynamic demand for construction chemicals as a result of the extensive eco-
nomic stimulus programs and for battery chemicals as a result of rapidly increasing electric vehicle
production (GTAI USA Chemicals).

Despite an across-the-board recovery in prices, the U.S. oil and gas sector was still affected by
the previous year’s price slump, when 46 producing companies in the sector had to file for bank-
ruptcy (Haynes Boone). While more than 1,000 production facilities were active at times in 2019,
that number had plummeted to 250 by the summer of 2020. By the end of 2021, however, 586
production sites had been counted again (Baker Hughes). While nationwide crude oil production
declined slightly (-1.3 percent), also due to the production losses caused by Hurricane Ida in Au-
gust, growth in liquefied natural gas production continued (+3.5 percent) (EIA). Thanks to new
infrastructure coming on stream and driven by strong demand from Asia, U.S. liquefied natural gas
exports continued to grow very strongly (+50 percent, EIA)

The financial situation of the Gulf states, which had been strained in the previous year, im-
proved profoundly as a result of stabilized oil and gas prices. In Saudi Arabia, the budget deficit fell
from $78 billion to just $18 billion (GTAI Saudi Arabia). The renewed strong growth in export rev-
enues enabled the Gulf states to accelerate their project awards again for the strategic diversifica-
tion of their economies and the necessary expansion of energy infrastructure. In Saudi Arabia, the
expansion and diversification of downstream industries (chemicals and petrochemicals) is a key
element of the development strategy, along with the strong expansion of green power production
via wind and solar power plants, which can now be realized at an accelerated pace again. In view
of the sharp rise in demand for electricity, the country is also pressing ahead with plans to build
two nuclear power plants.

Technologies

In the course of the German energy transition and the impending shutdown of the last nuclear
power plants at the end of 2022, investments in flexible conventional power plants will continue
to be critical in view of the volatile generation of wind and solar power. In spring 2021, 20 conven-
tional power plant projects had been approved (including seven already under construction) or
were in the middle of the approval process. Apart from three hydroelectric power plants, these
new projects are predominantly gas-fired power plants (UBA). The energy industry in Germany,
however, plays only a minor role in the market for externally contracted services, accounting for
just 6.9 percent of the total (Liin, p. 34). Dismantling nuclear facilities will remain a stable sector
for the foreseeable future.

In the EU, France, Finland and a number of Eastern European countries such as the Czech Re-
public, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Romania and Bulgaria are also relying on nuclear
power in their decarbonization strategies (Handelsblatt - Atomkraft). To cope with the phase-out
of coal-fired power generation, Poland plans to build six nuclear reactors in addition to investing
heavily in the use of renewable energy sources (GTAI Poland new energy policy), with the first
scheduled to come on line in 2033. The country can use €14 billion from the EU COVID-19 recon-
struction plan to decarbonize its energy sector (GTAI Poland promotion). These funds will be used
to further expand wind power and green hydrogen production, among other projects. However,
conflict over the constitutionality of Polish laws with the EU is jeopardizing the approval and dis-
bursement of these funds.

France, one of the world’s largest producers of nuclear power, is pushing ahead with upgrading
its existing nuclear facilities. In November, President Emmanuel Macron announced that the coun-
try would not only invest in extending the operating lives of existing plants but also build new
nuclear reactors as it moves toward its goal of climate neutrality by 2050 (Tagesschau).

The UK government allocated £1.7 billion in October enabling it to make the final investment
decision on another new nuclear power plant alongside Hinkley Point C, which is currently under
construction, before the end of this parliamentary term (Nuclear Engineering - funds for nuclear).
Hinkley Point Cis currently scheduled by operator EDF for commissioning in June 2026, and current
cost estimates for the overall project are £22-23 billion (at 2015 prices, EDF). In addition to these
large-scale plants, the UK government is also pushing ahead with the development of smaller nu-
clear reactors as part of its ”Net Zero Strategy.” In November, Rolls-Royce announced the raising
of £200 million in private funding, which it plans to use to realize the first “Small Modular Reactors”
(SMRs) within the next decade (Economist).

The breakthrough of mRNA technology in the development of successful COVID-19 vaccines
provided a very strong boost to the biopharma industry. With revenue in 2021 in the order of €45
billion for the two mRNA vaccines from Biontech/Pfizer and Moderna (Evaluate, p. 27) and a mas-
sive influx of capital into the industry, there has been a surge in investment in European sites. Ina
short time, high production capacities for these innovative vaccines have been created here in
close cooperation with industrial service providers. As a result of this development, the global
share of biotechnologically manufactured pharmaceutical products rose from 30 percent in the
previous year to 34 percent in 2021 (Evaluate, p. 18). Due to the pandemic-related high demand,
the global sales volume of prescribed medicines has increased very strongly (+14.3 percent) (Eval-
uate, p. 17).

B.2.1.2 Factors influencing business development

In the course of the reporting year, the Bilfinger Group’s operating business largely recovered from
what was at times a severe negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and volatile oil price devel-
opments in the prior year.

The activities of the Engineering & Maintenance Europe, Engineering & Maintenance Interna-
tional and Technologies segments in the core regions of Europe, North America and the Middle
East are each subject to specific influencing factors in the individual sectors of industry. In the key
sectors, the following main trends were recorded in the reporting period:

At Engineering & Maintenance International, service and framework agreements accounted
for about 65 percent of revenue while the project business accounted for approximately 35 per-
cent.

In the Technologies segment, around 95 percent of sales were generated almost entirely from
the execution of projects and the production of components, while service and framework agree-
ments accounted for 5 percent of sales.

For the Group as a whole, framework and service agreements slightly predominated with a
share of around 65 percent of Group revenue, while projects and component manufacturing
accounted for around 35 percent.

In financial year 2021, orders received for the Bilfinger Group of €4,007.8 million were 8 percent
above the prior-year figure; organically, the increase was 9 percent. This was mainly due to a good
demand level in European markets. The market environment in 2021 largely recovered from the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that began in the previous year, showing a generally positive
trend. At the end of the year, order backlog amounted to €2,946.3 million, and was thus 14 percent
above the figure for the prior year (organically: 12 percent). Revenue increased by 8 percent to
€3,737.4 million; organically it increased by 11 percent. Here, too, the expected recovery following
the COVID-19 pandemic materialized, particularly in our activities in Europe. By contrast, develop-
ment in the markets outside Europe was slower.

increased by 6 percent (organically: 10 percent) to €553.3 million, although the trend in both North
America and the Middle East was more subdued than initially expected. In the project business in
North America in particular, high inflation and supply bottlenecks played a major role, resulting in
some customers postponing investment decisions. Nevertheless, in line with the strategy in this
region, important contracts were signed for service agreements and medium-sized projects.

Bilfinger reports on operating units that are active outside the defined business segments, regions
and industries under Other Operations. These units are not part of the strategic positioning of the
Group; they will be managed independently for value until a suitable owner has been found. As of
January 1, 2021, Other Operations included three individual units. The selling process for one of
these companies was completed in the course of 2021 so that two companies remained in Other
Operations at the end of the year.

In Other Operations, orders received increased by 9 percent (organically: 37 percent) to €252.9

Group revenue recovered from the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the volatile oil
price development in the previous year. It rose by 8 percent to €3,737.4 million (previous year:
€3,461.0 million). Revenue includes in particular revenue from the provision of services and from
production orders.

Cost of sales
The main components of cost of sales are material expenses and personnel expenses. Other com-
ponents of cost of sales are depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization of rights
of use from leases in accordance to IFRS 16 and of intangible assets from acquisitions, and other
costs directly allocable to the selling process. The level of these costs in relation to sales revenue
differs from period to period and fluctuates from order to order, mainly depending on the extent
that subcontractors are used. Whereas order processing in the Group’s own output volume is re-
flected in both material expenses and personnel expenses, all costs for the use of subcontractors
are allocated to material expenses.

Cost of sales increased by 6 percent to €3,350.4 million (previous year: €3,164.9 million), and
in relation to revenue was 90 percent (previous year: 91 percent). Of that total, material and per-
sonnel expenses accounted for 77 percentage points (previous year: 78 percentage points). In the


--- Page 22 ---

Bilfinger SE
Annual Report 2021,

B_ Combined management report 73
B.2. Economic report

previous year, cost of sales included amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions in the
amount of €1.7 million; no further amortization was carried out in the reporting year. Depreciation
of property, plant and equipment and the amortization of other intangible assets amounted to
€49.1 million (previous year: €59.3 million). This includes impairment losses of €0.5 million (previ-
ous year: €6.9 million). Depreciation and amortization on rights of use from leases amounted €51.8
million (previous year: €56.4 million). This figure includes impairment losses in the amount €2.1
million (previous year: €3.3 million).

Gross profit

Gross profit increased by 31 percent to €387.0 million (previous year: €296.1 million). In addition
to increased revenue, this is primarily attributable to improvements in capacity utilization as well
as improvements in order processing. The gross margin accounted for a share of 10.4 percent of
revenue (previous year: 8.6 percent).

Selling and administrative expense

Selling, general and administrative expense continued to decline significantly to €290.7 million
(previous year: €309.7 million). This is primarily the result of lower burdens from special items, in
particular from the harmonization of IT systems and from restructuring expenses in the amount of
€5.1 million (previous year: €18.4 million). Selling and administrative expenses adjusted for these
special items continued to improve to €285.6 million (previous year: €291.3 million). COVID-19-
related one-time effects such as lower travel expenses continued to have a positive impact in the
reporting year.

The share of selling and administrative expenses in revenue was reduced further to 7.8 percent
(previous year: 8.9 percent). Adjusted for special items from the harmonization of IT systems and
restructuring expenses, the ratio improved significantly to 7.6 percent due to the revenue growth
(previous year: 8.4 percent).

Other operating income and expense
The balance from other operating income and expense was positive at €24.6 million (previous
year: -€57.9 million).

Income in the reporting year totaled €68.4 million (previous year: €47.8 million). The increase
resulted mainly from the disposal of non-operational real estate in the amount of €30.4 million
(previous year: €1.0 million). Disposals from property, plant and equipment thus increased to a
total of €34.5 million (previous year: €4.3 million). Other income decreased to €8.5 million (previ-
ous year: €27.7 million). In the previous year, this figure included income of €16.7 million from a
settlement agreement with former Executive Board members of Bilfinger SE.

Other operating expenses fell considerably in the reporting year to -€43.8 million (previous
year: -€105.7 million). This was mainly due to significantly lower restructuring expenses of -€16.7
million — these had totaled -€66.9 million in the previous year due to the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic. Other expenses decreased to €7.7 million (previous year: €18.0 million). In financial
year 2020, this item included impairment losses on goodwill from Other Operations amounting to
€6.8 million.

Income from investments accounted for using the equity method

Income from investments accounted for using the equity method is composed of income and ex-
penses from associates and joint ventures. It fell to €3.1 million (previous year: €12.5 million). This
mainly reflects the sale of the stake in a joint venture in Oman.

EBITA / adjusted EBITA / EBIT

Following the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and volatile oil price development in the
previous year, adjusted EBITA increased significantly again in the reporting year. The increase to
€137.2 million (previous year: €19.8 million) was mainly due to the expected business recovery. In
addition, proceeds from the disposal of property and real estate in the amount of €30.4 million
(previous year: €1.0 million) had an impact. In relation to the increase in sales, the adjusted EBITA
margin improved to 3.7 (previous year: 0.6) percent. Exchange rate effects again had only an in-
significant impact, amounting to €1.8 million (previous year: -€0.4 million)

While the COVID-19 pandemic and volatile oil price developments had a tangible impact on the
results of our segments in the previous year, the expected recovery materialized in the reporting
year. After the number of employees had to be reduced by around 5,000 Group-wide in the course
of 2020, it was stable overall in the reporting year. The number of European employees on short-
time work was also no longer significant in the financial year.

Government support measures were still mainly utilized in the Netherlands, the United King-
dom, Poland and Austria. In accordance with the net method selected, government grants, which
under IAS 20 are classified as government grants related to profit or loss, were recognized as a
reduction of the corresponding personnel expense, in the amount of about €9 million (previous
year: €36 million). Details can be found in Chapter C.6.3.2 Government grants and other measures
in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Adjusted EBITA in the Engineering & Maintenance Europe segment improved to €130.7 million
(previous year: €68.8 million); the adjusted EBITA margin rose to 5.2 percent (previous year: 3.1
percent). This reflected the success in improving the sales mix as well as further increasing the
utilization rate.

Adjusted EBITA in the Engineering & Maintenance International segment was negative at
-€13.9 million (previous year: -€20.8 million), but with a positive result in the fourth quarter. Here,
better capacity utilization and strategic progress toward increasing the share of service contracts

as well as from small and mid-sized projects are showing some effects. The adjusted EBITA margin
in this segment was -2.5 percent (prior year: -4.0 percent).

At Technologies, adjusted EBITA improved to a clearly positive €20.3 million ( previous year:
-€10.5 million). This corresponds to an adjusted EBITA margin of 3.6 percent (previous year: -2.1
percent). In this segment, structural measures already initiated in the previous year led to a sus-
tained reversal of the trend in earnings development.

Adjusted EBITA not allocated to the segments showed a break-even result of €0.2 million (pre-
vious year: -€17.7 million) in the reporting year as a result of proceeds from the sale of land and
real estate. The Other Operations also included in this position provided a positive earnings con-
tribution

Reported EBITA of the Group — not including the special items described in B.2.2 Results of
operations - adjusted earnings per share — improved substantially as compared to the prior year,
increasing to €121.2 million (previous year: -€57.0 million). It is important to note that this figure

in the prior year was impacted in particular by necessary restructuring charges in connection with
the COVID-19 pandemic and volatile oil price developments.

Reported EBITA of the individual segments including restructuring charges also improved
across the board. Accordingly, EBITA at Engineering & Maintenance Europe was €115.5 million
(previous year: €36.0 million), at Engineering & Maintenance International -€17.6 million (previous
year: -€34.5 million) and at Technologies €19.2 million (previous year: -€36.0 million).

EBITA not allocated to the business segments amounted to €4.1 million (previous year: -€22.5
million). It also includes restructuring costs and expenses for projects related to process and sys-
tem harmonization as well as income from the disposal of investments in the course of portfolio
adjustments.

Because there was no amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions in the reporting year,
Group EBIT of €121.2 million (previous year: -€65.5) was in line with reported EBITA.

Financial result

The financial result declined significantly to -€5.9 million (previous year: €181.1 million). This is
mainly due to the income from the mark-to-market valuation of the preferred participation note
recognized in income in the previous year following the sale of Apleona. Bilfinger’s former Building
and Facility Services business (now: Apleona) was sold to financial investor EQT in September 2016.
Bilfinger had participated in the resale as agreed in December 2020, which under IFRS led to an
appreciation of the preferred participation note of €209.7 million in the 2020 consolidated finan-
cial statements. Following completion of the transaction in April 2021 it will now be recognized in
income under the German Commercial Code (HGB) in Bilfinger SE’s consolidated financial state-
ments for financial year 2021.

Interest income increased in the reporting year to €17.2 million (previous year: €1.4 million),
mainly as a result of particularly high income in the reporting year from interest on late payment
of tax receivables and from the investment of cash and cash equivalents with variable interest
rates.

The current interest expense amounted to -€22.1 million (previous year: -€20.5 million). This
is mainly incurred on financial debt with fixed and variable interest rates. In October 2021, tranches
of the promissory note loans with variable interest rates due in April 2022 with a nominal value of
€108.5 million were repaid early. The interest expense on lease liabilities in accordance with IFRS
16 amounted to -€5.7 million (previous year: -€4.5 million).

Bilfinger SE
Annual Report 2021,

B_ Combined management report 76
B.2. Economic report

Declining income from securities in the amount of €8.4 million (previous year: €209.7 million)
is mainly due to the valuation difference between the final proceeds realized on disposal and the
preferred participation note for Apleona, which was upgraded in the previous year.

The interest expense from an increase in the retirement benefit obligation — offset against
income from plan assets — amounted to -€2.0 million (previous year: -€3.6 million). The interest
expense for minority interest was -€1.7 million (previous year: €1.4 million).

Earnings before and after taxes

Earnings from continuing operations before taxes of €115.3 million (previous year: €115.6 million)
were at the level of the previous year. This means that the effect in 2020 from the revaluation of
the preferred participation note for Apleona was offset in the reporting year by improved operat-
ing earnings including the positive one-time effects from the disposal of properties described
above.

In financial year 2021, the Group recorded tax income of €8.1 million (previous year: -€7.5
million), including tax refunds of around €31 million from tax audits for the years 2001-2009. In-
come after taxes amounted to €123.4 million (previous year: €108.0 million).

Income after income taxes from discontinued operations improved to €6.8 million (previous
year: -€7.0 million) due to the resolution of several disputes and issues in connection with subsid-
iaries sold in previous years and the associated elimination of the need for risk provisions.

Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests amounted to €0.7 million (previous year: €1.6 million).

Net profit / earnings per share

Consolidated net income increased to €129.5 million (previous year: €99.4 million) as a result of
the improvement in EBITA and also supported by tax refunds. This surpassed the previous year’s
figure, which was impacted in particular by the special item resulting from the revaluation of the
preferred participation note for Apleona. Basic earnings per share increased to €3.19 (previous
year: €2.47), while diluted earnings per share also rose to €3.16 (previous year: €2.44).

Net profit from continuing operations adjusted for amortization of intangible assets from ac-
quisitions and goodwill impairments and for the special items described below amounted to
€89.0 million (previous year: -€8.0 million); adjusted earnings per share from continuing opera-
tions were €2.17 (previous year: €0.20). The figure relates to diluted earnings per share.

Dividend

The Executive and Supervisory Boards will propose to the Annual General Meeting that an in-
creased dividend of €4.75 (prior year: €1.88) per share be distributed. The amount results from
the minimum dividend of €1.00 per share and an additional distribution of €3.75 per share from
the proceeds from the sale of Apleona in Bilfinger SE’s distributable earnings.

Adjusted earnings per share

The calculation of earnings per share in accordance with IFRS is presented in the income state-
ment. Earnings per share after adjusting for exceptional items and the amortization and impair-
ment of intangible assets is a metric that is suited to enabling comparability over time and fore-
casting future profitability.

process and system harmonization of €6.5 million (previous year: €13.2 million) were offset by
income from disposals of investments of €8.5 million (previous year: expenses of -€3.9 million). In
the previous year, there was also income of €17.1 million from the settlement with former mem-
bers of the Executive Board.

Unusually high special items in the financial result in the previous year related to earnings from
the measurement of our preferred participation note for Apleona.

Amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions and goodwill was not recognized in the re-
porting year (prior year: €8.5 million).

Adjustments for income taxes reflect Bilfinger’s specific situation in the context of the trans-
formation and take into account the high level of tax loss carryforwards, some of which were not
capitalized. To establish operational comparability, Bilfinger examines what a normalized average

Group tax rate would be. After taking into account the above-mentioned circumstances, Bilfinger
estimates this to be 27 percent on average in the long term.

Value added — the difference between return on capital employed (ROCE) and the cost of capital
— is an important key figure for measuring the return on capital employed and for its efficient
controlling. We include continuing operations in order to provide better comparability over time
in the consideration of return on capital employed.

To determine the return, we rely on an after taxes calculation, based on EBIT and including
interest income and income from securities. This means that we also consider special items, amor-
tization of capitalized assets from acquisitions as well as potentially goodwill impairments in the
calculation of the return. We thus want to ensure that all success components are represented in
our return on capital employed.

The average capital employed of continuing operations increased to €2,088.9 million in the
reporting year (previous year: €2,005.0 million). The return for continuing operations improved to
€154.9 million (previous year: €138.0 million).

The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the Group was 8.5 percent after taxes (previ-
ous year: 8.8 percent). Overall, ROCE improved to 7.4 percent (previous year: 6.9 percent); value
added in absolute terms improved further to -€23.4 million (previous year: -€37.9 million).

The company’s net assets remain sound. The balance-sheet total decreased only slightly to
€3,148.7 million (previous year: €3,256.3 million).

On the assets side, non-current assets decreased to €1,281.4 million (previous year: €1,313.4
million). In this context, intangible assets of €780.6 million (previous year: €765.2 million) were
well above the prior-year figure. Goodwill included in this figure increased to €777.7 million (pre-
vious year: €761.5 million) mainly due to changes in exchange rates. The annual impairment test
in accordance with IAS 36 is conducted at the level of the operating segments or individual groups
in Other Operations. |t did not reveal any need for impairment. An event-driven impairment test
was not conducted in the reporting year, as there were no indications of a possible impairment of
a cash-generating unit. In the reporting year, non-current assets included property, plant and
equipment amounting to €258.7 million (previous year: €269.7 million), while rights of use from
leases in accordance with IFRS 16 totaled €176.7 million (previous year: €189.3 million).

Other non-current assets decreased to €65.4 million (previous year: €89.2 million), with de-
ferred tax assets comprising the largest item at €46.7 million (previous year: €55.8 million).

Current assets decreased to €1,867.3 million (previous year: €1,942.9 million). Receivables and
other current assets recorded a growth-related increase to €909.1 million (previous year: €865.6
million), with receivables from work in progress rising to €317.0 million (previous year: €262.4
million). In the previous year, securities held as current assets included the preferred participation
note for Apleona with a value of €450.0 million; this item was reversed following the resale of the
company in the reporting year. Part of the payment received in this connection was invested in
financial instruments with a maximum term of 12 months; this led to an increase in other financial
investments to €189.9 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased overall to €642.9 million (pre-
vious year: €510.6 million) in the year under review.

On the liabilities side, equity increased to €1,289.0 million (previous year: €1,198.6 million)
Positive earnings after taxes of €129.5 million (previous year: €99.4 million) had an increasing ef-
fect. The equity ratio was 41 percent at the balance-sheet date (previous year: 37 percent).

Non-current liabilities totaled €729.0 million (previous year: €886.4 million). Non-current fi-
nancial debt decreased significantly to €395.1 million (previous year: €521.3 million). This is due
to the early repayment in October 2021 of tranches of the promissory note loans with a nominal
value of €108.5 million due in April 2022. Non-current financial debt also includes a bond in the
amount of €250.0 million maturing in June 2024. Non-current lease liabilities in accordance with
IFRS 16 totaled €139.9 million (previous year: €146.3 million). Current financial debt amounted to
€54.3 million (previous year: €46.9 million) and mainly relates to current lease liabilities under IFRS
16 of €45.0 million (previous year: €46.6 million). Net liquidity amounted to €383.4 million (previ-
ous year: -€57.5 million) as of the reporting date.

Current liabilities amounted to €1,130.7 million (previous year: €1,171.3 million). Other provi-
sions decreased to €215.8 million (previous year: €300.3 million). Working capital totaled -€41.9
million (previous year: €307.9 million). Trade payables increased to €337.2 million (previous year:
€293.3 million), while advance payments received remained unchanged at €143.5 million (previ-
ous year: €142.1 million).

Pension provisions amounted to €306.5 million (previous year: €340.0 million), based on an
increased discount rate of 1.05 percent (previous year: 0.7 percent) in the euro zone.

There were no assets and liabilities classified as held for sale as of the balance-sheet date, as
was the case for each in the previous year.

B.2.4 Financial position

Principles and objectives of financial management

The main aspects of the Group’s financial policy are determined by the Executive Board of Bilfinger
SE. The prime objective of financial management is to maintain liquidity and limit financial risk. In
addition, we regard financial flexibility as an important precondition for our further corporate de-
velopment. Within the context of centralized Group financing, the application of available surplus
liquidity as well as the provision and utilization of financing instruments for the entire Bilfinger
Group are managed and executed by Corporate Treasury & Investor Relations.

Management of market price change risks as well as creditworthiness risks of financial coun-
terparties is also carried out by means of a Group-wide limit and control system. To this end, fi-
nancial derivatives are also used to a limited extent. We report on the management of financial
risks in Chapter 8.3.2.3 Risk and opportunity report — Financial risks and in detail in the notes to

the consolidated financial statements in Chapter C.6.30 Risks related to financial instruments, fi-

nancial risk management and hedging transactions.

Financing

The main source of funds for corporate financing is our business operations and the cash they
generate. This is based not only on operating profits, but also on the stringent management of
working capital.

For the purpose of general corporate financing, which is carried out under consideration of
matching maturities, our main banks have provided a syndicated credit facility of €250 million,
which had not been utilized at the balance-sheet date. Availability of the facility is firmly commit-
ted until December 2023. The respective interest rate for drawings depends on the interest rate
period selected; the credit margin is oriented toward a rating grid. The syndicated cash credit line
includes a financial covenant in the form of a limitation of the dynamic gearing ratio (adjusted net
debt / adjusted EBITDA). We also have additional short-term bilateral credit commitments of ap-
proximately €85 million.

In addition, we issued a bond in 2019 with a nominal value of €250.0 million, maturity in June
2024 and a fixed interest rate over the entire period. Moreover, several promissory note loans
totaling €123.0 million maturing in April 2022 and in October 2024 with partly variable and partly


--- Page 31 ---

Bilfinger SE
Annual Report 2021,

B_ Combined management report 82
B.2. Economic report

fixed interest rates over the term to maturity were also taken out, whereby the variable tranches
totaling €108.5 million were repaid early during the reporting year. The tranches with fixed interest
rates amounting to €14.5 million remained as of the reporting date.

Bilfinger has at all times complied with the undertaking given in the terms and conditions of
the new bond issued in June 2019 from the time of the issue of the bond in June 2019 until the
end of the past financial year.

We have credit by way of bank guarantees of €905.6 million from various banks and bonding
insurers available to meet the needs of the operating business, which are not fully utilized. Infor-
mation on existing financial debt is provided in Chapter C.6.26 Financial debt.

Financial debt totaled €449.4 million (previous year: €568.1 million) at the reporting date, in-
cluding lease liabilities of €184.9 million (previous year: €192.9 million) in accordance with IFRS 16.
In terms of the financial debt, €395.1 million (previous year: €521.3 million) related to non-current
liabilities and €54.3 million (previous year: €46.9 million) to current liabilities. We do not utilize off-
balance sheet financing instruments. Bank balances of €2.1 million (previous year: €2.8 million)
were pledged as of the reporting date

Approved capital of €66.3 million is available for future capital increases. Bilfinger also has con-
ditional capital of €13.3 million to be used to grant conversion and / or warrant rights in the case
of convertible bonds being issued. We report in detail on the existing authorizations of the Execu-
tive Board to raise capital in Chapter 8.6 Takeover-relevant information pursuant to Section 289a
and Section 315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB).

Investments

Investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets — not including intangible as-
sets from acquisitions in accordance with IFRS 3 — rose again to a sustainable level in the reporting
year, following a significant reduction in the previous year against the backdrop of economic un-
certainty and declining revenue. They amounted to €61.3 million (previous year: €36.6 million), of

from January 1, 2021, and transferred to the newly established subsidiary Bilfinger Height Special-
ists B.V., Netherlands.

The cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations fell slightly to €112.5 million (prior
year: €120.4 million) due to an increase in special items. Cash flow from operating activities ad-
justed for special items, on the other hand, was stable at €164.7 million (previous year: €163.7
million). The main factor contributing to this development was successful working capital manage-
ment, with a further improvement in net working capital in relation to the significant increase in
revenue. Tax refunds amounting to €29.0 million also had a significantly positive impact on the
cash effect of taxes.

Special items increased to a total of -€52.2 million (previous year: -€43.3 million). While pay-
ments for restructuring were only slightly lower than in the previous year, significantly fewer funds
were used for process and system harmonization. The prior-year figure, however, included cash
inflows from the settlement reached with former members of the Executive Board.

Investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets increased significantly to
€61.3 million (previous year: €36.6 million). These outflows were offset by an equally sharp in-
crease in cash inflow of €63.5 million (previous year: €9.4 million), primarily due to the disposal of
various non-operational properties and land (inflow of €57.1 million). Net capital expenditures
were thus negative, declining to -€2.2 million (previous year: €27.2 million). Contrary to original
expectations, these non-recurring effects contributed to a significant increase in free cash flow to
€114.7 million (previous year: €93.2 million). Adjusted free cash flow also improved to €166.9 mil-
lion (previous year: €136.5 million).

Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took advantage in the previous year of
the option to defer social security contributions and tax payments to improve the liquidity situation
over the course of the year. At the end of 2020, these liabilities, which as of June 30, 2020,
amounted to a total in the high double-digit million-euro range, had been nearly fully settled. In
the reporting year, this option was used only to a limited extent. Details are explained in Chapter

C.6.3.2 Government grants and other measures in connection with the COVID 19 pandemic.

Disposals of financial assets resulted in a cash inflow of €14.9 million (previous year: €8.3 mil-
lion), primarily due to the sale of Muscat Engineering Consultancy LLC, Oman. Investments in fi-
nancial assets were incurred in the amount of €2.4 million (previous year: €0.0 million). They re-
lated to the acquisition of the activities of a Dutch specialist for rope access to industrial plants at
great heights as part of an asset deal with effect from January 1, 2021, and the transfer to the
newly established subsidiary Bilfinger Height Specialists B.V., Netherlands.

Cash outflow from financing activities increased significantly to €266.5 million (previous year:
-€82.2 million). From the repayment and taking of loans there was a net outflow of €158.5 million
(previous year: €51.8 million). In the reporting year, dividend payments including payments to mi-
nority shareholders of €78.5 million (previous year: €7.3 million) were significantly higher than the
previous year’s outflows, because at that time the dividend had been reduced to the statutory
minimum of €0.12 to improve the liquidity situation in view of the economic uncertainty caused
by the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduction was made up for in the reporting year following the
stabilization of business performance, with the basic dividend of €1.00 per share being additionally
increased by the €0.88 reduction from the previous year, resulting in a dividend of €1.88 per share
being paid out to the shareholders of Bilfinger SE. Interest payments increased to €27.6 million
(previous year: €22.8 million).

Continuing operations resulted in a net cash inflow of €129.1 million (previous year: €19.3 mil-
lion)

Cash flows from discontinued operations amounted to €2.4 million (previous year: -€6.5 mil-
lion)

Changes in exchange rates resulted in an arithmetical increase in cash and cash equivalents of
€0.8 million (previous year: decrease of €2.0 million). Cash and cash equivalents of activities clas-
sified as held for sale in the reporting year amounted to €0.0 million as was the case in the previous
year. In total, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year increased to €642.9 million (previous
year: €510.6 million).

Origin and distribution of value creation
The Group’s value creation originates from revenue, income from investments accounted for using
the equity method and other operating income. Depreciation, material expenses and other costs
had an impact on value creation.

In the distribution of value creation in 2021, 93 percent was accounted for by employees (pre-
vious year: 93 percent), 1 percent by creditors (previous year: 1 percent). The remaining value
creation resulted in a corresponding increase in equity.

The income statement of the company financial statements of Bilfinger SE is characterized by its
holding function. Revenue amounted to €114 million (previous year: €139 million) and resulted
almost solely from output volume charged to companies of the Group as well as from rental in-
come. Revenues from services charged to other companies in the Group are comprised of the
costs of these services plus an adequate margin. As a result of efficiency enhancements at head-
quarters and thus the associated cost savings, revenue was significantly lower than in the previous
year while the margin remained constant.

Other operating income of €76 million (previous year: €40 million) mainly related to income
from the sale of non-operational properties, the reversal of other provisions and write-ups of re-
ceivables from associates. The significant increase compared with the previous year was due in
particular to substantial book gains on the disposal of real estate.

The increase in personnel expenses from €43 million to €47 million was mainly due to higher
management bonuses and other compensation in connection with the increase in corporate earn-
ings following a weak performance in 2020 due to the Corona pandemic.

Other operating expenses of €105 million (previous year: €200 million) were mainly made up
of non-personnel administrative expenses, IT costs, rents and leases, insurance premiums, legal
and consulting fees, additions to other accruals, losses from the disposal of investments and im-
pairment losses on current assets. The significant decrease is mainly due to the fact that write-
downs on receivables from associates were significantly lower than in the previous year and losses
on the disposal of investments were significantly higher in the previous year. Consulting costs were
also further reduced.

Income from financial assets of €354 million (previous year: €90 million) mainly comprised the
book gain of €263 million (previous year: €0 million) from inflows in the spring of 2021 from the


--- Page 37 ---

Bilfinger SE

B_ Combined management report 88
B.2. Economic report

preferred participation notes in connection with the sale of the former Building and Facility busi-
ness segment (Apleona) completed in 2016, which were recognized in income in spring 2021 with
effect under commercial law. Also included are earnings from profit and loss transfer agreements,
dividends received from Group companies, and write-downs on investments. The significant in-
crease is mainly due to the above-mentioned inflows recognized in income from the preferred
participation notes, but also to lower write-downs on the carrying amounts of investments in as-
sociates compared with the prior year.
The sharp increase in net interest income is partly due to interest income from tax refunds in
connection with completed tax audits, but also to higher net interest income from pensions and
plan assets due to a positive performance of plan assets.
Earnings before taxes thus increased from €2 million to €389 million.
In terms of the income tax expense, it should generally be kept in mind that distributions as well
as income and expense from investment measurement and disposals are mainly tax-neutral. The
reported income of €30 million (previous year: €4 million) results from tax refunds and the reversal
of tax accruals in connection with completed tax audits totaling €33 million (previous year: €4 mil-
lion) and current tax expense for the financial year totaling €3 million (previous year: €0 million).

Distributable earnings in the amount of €217 million result from the annual profit of +€419
million (previous year: +€6 million) and retained earnings in the amount of €7 million (previous
year: €39 million) with a release from retained earnings in the amount of €209 million (previous
year: €38 million). It will be proposed that a dividend for financial year 2021 of €4.75 per share be
paid out. This represents a dividend distribution of approximately €193 million in relation to the
number of shares entitled to a dividend as of March 7, 2022.

The assets and financial position of Bilfinger SE are governed by its function as a holding company.

Assets totaling €2,803 million (previous year: €2,535 million) mainly comprised financial assets
of €1,680 million (previous year: €1,797 million), receivables and other assets of €456 million (pre-
vious year: €247 million) as well as cash and cash equivalents of €651 million (previous year: €473
million).

Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment decreased by €2 million, in particular due
to the sale of non-operational properties.

The €117 million decrease in financial assets to €1,680 million was mainly due to the disposal
of the preferred participation notes, which were capitalized at a carrying amount of €195 million,
as already mentioned in the section on the results of operations. This was partly offset by an in-
crease of €73 million from the intra-Group purchase of a subsidiary in Scandinavia in connection
with an optimization of the shareholding structure in Scandinavia and the UK.

Receivables and other assets of €297 million (previous year: €230 million) mainly comprised
receivables from subsidiaries in connection with the Group’s centralized corporate financing. Also
included in this figure is a fixed-term deposit of €140 million (previous year: €0 million) invested
for twelve months on a non-cancelable basis as part of the cash inflow from the sale of the pre-

B.2. Economic report

ferred participation notes. Cash and cash equivalents recorded a significant increase of €178 mil-
lion to €651 million, largely due to of the inflow from the preferred participation notes the sale of
properties. This was partly offset by a €93 million reduction in promissory note financing.

Prepaid expenses resulted from a discount on the bond issued in 2019 and are reduced in
proportion to the maturity.

The excess of plan assets over pension liabilities relates to existing surplus cover of partial re-
tirement benefit obligations through plan assets.

The other side of the balance sheet included equity of €1,680 million (previous year: €1,325
million), provisions of €86 million (previous year: €111 million) and liabilities of €1,037 million (pre-
vious year: €1,099 million).

The significant increase in equity resulted from the annual profit for 2021, which exceeded the
dividend payment for 2020 which was paid in 2021. The equity ratio thus increased from 52 per-
cent to 60 percent.

Provisions included defined-benefit obligations in the amount of €26 million (previous year:
€22 million), tax provisions of €21million (previous year: €4 million) and other provisions of €39
million (previous year: €85 million).

The increase in pension provisions results from a decrease in net plan assets due to a payout
in the amount of the pension payments of the previous year. Another factor was the fact that the
discount rate decreased further compared with the previous year.

The increase in tax provisions results from a reclassification of tax provisions relating to units
sold in previous years, which were previously reported under other provisions. This was offset by
reversals of provisions for corporate income tax and trade tax in connection with the results of the
tax audit.

The significant decrease in other provisions is mainly due to the reclassification of tax provi-
sions relating to disposed units mentioned in the previous section and the resolution of several
disputes and issues in connection with subsidiaries sold in previous years.

Liabilities mainly relate to bond and promissory note financing, which was reduced from €358
million to €255 million in the financial year, and liabilities to affiliated companies from cash invest-
ments in the central cash pooling system amounting to €742 million (prior year: €712 million).

Opportunities and risks
The business development of Bilfinger SE as Group holding company is generally subject to the
same risks and opportunities as the Bilfinger Group.

As the parent company of the Bilfinger Group, Bilfinger SE is included in the Group-wide inter-
nal control and risk management system.

Outlook

As the parent company of the Group without any business operations of its own, Bilfinger SE re-
ceives revenue primarily from its subsidiaries. Expectations with regard to the Group’s business
development will therefore generally significantly affect the earnings of Bilfinger SE. For financial
year 2022, we expect a positive but significantly lower result, given that the special item from the
inflow from the preferred participation notes had a significantly positive impact on the result for
financial year 2021.

Bilfinger is an internationally focused Group that provides what tend to be highly diversified ser-
vices. We therefore depend on employees who bring a broad range of experience, qualifications
and perspectives to their jobs and help us to successfully take advantage of market opportunities.

One aspect of equal opportunity is equality among male and female employees. Our predom-
inantly industrial operational working environment in the commercial sector is, however, heavily
dominated by male workers. At the end of the reporting year, the share of women in the workforce
Group-wide was 10.5 percent (previous year: 10.3 percent).

Information in relation to the law that is valid in Germany on the equal participation of women
and men in executive positions in the private sector and in the civil service as well as the infor-
mation on the diversity concept as required by the CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG)
are included in Chapter A.4.1 Declaration of corporate governance and corporate governance re-

port, which is also available on the website www.bilfinger.com.
Employee development programs implemented over the course of the reporting year are de-
scribed in Chapter 8.5. Non-financial Group declaration.

B.2.7 Innovation (research and development report)
The focus of Bilfinger’s innovation activities in the reporting year remained in the area of digitali-
zation. The development of new solutions was carried out in line with the decentralized corporate
structure both at the operating companies and through central departments, which implement
Group-wide digitalization projects. New requirements of the operating companies were ad-
dressed, advanced in the context of joint developments and introduced in the operating business.
In the reporting year, Bilfinger implemented innovation projects with a total expense of
€5.8 million (previous year: €8.1 million).

The majority of the expense, as was the case in previous years, was incurred in the digitalization
field of innovation, with both solutions for our customers as well as for internal digitalization being
further developed. On the Bilfinger platform BCAP (Bilfinger Connected Asset Performance), plant
data is used for Internet of Things (loT) applications while solutions based on artificial intelligence
are also developed. This enhances overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) and, in particular, the
energy efficiency of our customers’ plants. The focus is on the reduction of quality deviations, im-
provement of plant availability as well as the optimization of energy management and product
throughput. The user interface of the BCAP platform has been redesigned, organized by user
groups to make it more user-friendly and equipped with the respective role-specific programs and
information content. New Edge solutions for installation in our customers’ plants expand the safe
deployment options of the BCAP platform, increase performance and reduce the operational costs
of the loT solutions.

In addition, the BCAP platform has also been further developed for internal use by the com-
pany’s own business units and implemented operationally. Asset management, for example, is
supported with digital solutions in the Bilfinger Maintenance Concept (BMC) and extensive evalu-
ations for control and optimization are provided automatically. The units involved in industrial
scaffolding and inspection services also use the platform as a customer portal to optimize their
operating business and communicate with customers.

For the monitoring and optimization of production processes, we have developed our solutions
with cognitive sensors that facilitate product quality tracking during the manufacturing process
using acoustic perception. This leads to an increase in the efficiency of production plants and re-
duces fluctuations in product quality. Blockchain technology is now being used to increase the
security of plant data.

Bilfinger’s digital application PIDGraph uses artificial intelligence to transfer existing asset dia-
grams from paper form to a digital format and supports our customers in the necessary digitaliza-
tion of the extensive documentation of existing assets. The technology can also be used to build a
modern object-oriented, digital structure for asset management from existing inventory documen-
tation. Initial developments in this area have already been successfully implemented with custom-
ers.

In the year under review, the program’s performance was significantly enhanced and the in-
terfaces to engineering programs used by customers were expanded. PIDGraph also forms the
basis for the implementation of ‘digital twins’ of real plants and contributes to the creation of a
central digital ‘single place of truth’ with remote access to required information.

The focus on developing digital solutions has proven to be forward-looking in light of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Using such solutions to monitor our customers’ production processes will

B.3 Risk and opportunity report

The recognition of opportunities and risks is an integral part of the management processes in all
of our units, both operational and administrative. We define risks as potential negative deviations
and opportunities as potential favorable deviations from our plans.

Bilfinger has a systematic management system for the integrated identification, evaluation and
management of risks and opportunities. This is intended in particular to avoid a threat to the ex-
istence of the company as a going concern and to achieve a sustained improvement in its earnings
situation

For reasons of consistency with Chapter 8.4 Outlook, the underlying timeline for the likelihood
of risks and opportunities includes financial year 2022.

B.3.1 Risk management

B.3.1.1 Basic principles

The Group-wide risk management system serves to identify, evaluate and control significant risks
in a targeted manner. It is focused on achieving the goals of the company in the context of the
strategy developed for the Group.

The risk management process covers all activities for the systematic handling of risks in the
Group. At Bilfinger, risk management is not an isolated process that runs parallel to company ac-
tivities, but rather an integral part of existing company and business processes.

The systematic approach to identifying, evaluating and managing relevant risks is based on the
Enterprise Risk Management — Integrated Framework (2004) of the Committee of Sponsoring Or-
ganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Opportunities and risks are reported with the
help of a top-down / bottom-up process established throughout the Group — an essential compo-
nent of risk management at Bilfinger. On the IT side, risk management is extensively supported by
a special risk management tool. Another key element of the risk management organization at
Bilfinger is the definition of clear roles and responsibilities.

The risk strategy for the Bilfinger Group is formulated by the Executive Board in the context of
the planning process and also includes the definition of parameters to assess which risks the com-
pany should take in order to achieve its desired goals, for example, by determining risk classes for
projects and framework agreements. The starting point is the company’s risk capacity. This de-
scribes the amount of risk the Group can take on without jeopardizing its continued existence. To
summarize, the following applies:

¢ Individual risks that put the Group in jeopardy may not be taken. This also applies if liquidity
cannot be quickly restored when a risk occurs.

° Possible combinations of significant individual risks are reviewed as to whether they represent
an existential threat in total. This creates an informative overall picture of the risk profile.

e Risks from large projects and services contracts are subject to a special review, among others
by Corporate Project Controlling.

e  Insurable risks are, where financially viable, transferred centrally to external insurance compa-
nies.

B.3_Risk and opportunity report

The line organization’s management is primarily accountable for the responsible handling of risks.
Supervisory Board, Audit Committee and Executive Board perform these superordinate functions:

e Supervisory Board and Audit Committee
The Audit Committee monitors the risk situation and the functionality of the risk management
system for the Supervisory Board on the basis of the risk report provided each quarter by the
Executive Board. The Audit Committee is also informed of the results of the monitoring activi-
ties carried out by Corporate Internal Audit & Investigations and Corporate Compliance. The
Supervisory Board and Audit Committee may make decisions regarding additional internal or
external reviews.

¢ Executive Board
The Executive Board assumes overall responsibility for the functionality of the risk manage-
ment system. It monitors the risk management cycle, carries out the final review and prioriti-
zation of significant Group risks and reports to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board
in this regard.

Bilfinger is oriented toward the Three Lines of Defense model, with operations and functional su-
pervision structured under Group headquarters and Corporate Internal Audit & Investigations.
Bilfinger’s responsibilities and tasks are clearly defined at these levels:

e First Line: Operational

e Division / Region Heads (Executive President / Financial Director)
Divisional / regional management is responsible for the functionality of the risk manage-
ment system and its monitoring at divisional / regional levels and in the local units. Divi-
sional / regional management regularly itemizes risks, as well as providing the final evalu-
ation and prioritization of significant risks for the divisions / regions. This also includes the
classification of risks to a defined risk owner and the approval of a division’s / region’s risk
portfolio in the context of the quarterly reporting process.

e Division / Region Risk Officer

In its entirety, specific responsibility for the operational implementation of the risk man-
agement process and for monitoring and identifying risks lies with the Division / Region
Risk Officer. This function is normally performed by a division’s / region’s financial director.
The tasks of the Division / Region Risk Officer include, among other things, the plausibility
of the overall risk situation with regard to its completeness and the evaluation of significant
risks as well as the appropriateness and effectiveness of the risk mitigation measures —
including the evaluation of necessary investments or expenses — and regular updates on
the risk situation.

e Division / Region Risk Coordinator
Division / Region Risk Coordinators consolidate the individual risks at divisional levels in the
course of risk inventory. They support the heads of the divisions / regions in the consistent
application of risk management methods and in reporting to Corporate Risk Management
or the Group Risk Organization.


--- Page 46 ---

Bilfinger SE
Annual Report 2021,

B_ Combined management report 97
B.3_Risk and opportunity report

e Risk Owner
Risk Owners are responsible for the identification, analysis and evaluation of individual
risks. This also includes the evaluation and implementation of appropriate risk mitigation
measures and the regular analysis and monitoring of the current situation regarding indi-
vidual risks. This also comprises the evaluation of necessary investments and other ex-
penses.

Second Line: Functional supervision of headquarters

e  Bilfinger Risk Committee

The Bilfinger Risk Committee generally meets every quarter on behalf of the Executive
Board. Members include the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Financial Directors of the
divisions / regions, the Group Risk Organization as well as the heads of Corporate Account-
ing, Controlling & Tax, Corporate Treasury, Corporate Legal & Insurance, Corporate Com-
pliance, Corporate Internal Audit & Investigations and the Head of Internal Control Sys-
tems. If necessary, the Bilfinger Risk Committee is supplemented with further experts from
other specialist areas.

The committee establishes plausibility for the risk reports quarterly and submits these
to the Executive Board. It supports the design of a pragmatic risk management system,
shares best-practice approaches and assumes responsibility for superordinate quality as-
surance of the quarterly risk report for significant Group risks. The Risk Committee also
fulfills an important advisory function and contributes recommendations on the design of
the risk management system.

e Group Risk Organization

Group Risk Organization at Bilfinger is responsible for and has decision-making authority
over methods and development of the risk management system. This includes the moni-
toring and design of all risk management processes at the level of the divisions / regions,
headquarters and the Group as a whole. Group Risk Organization also bears overall respon-
sibility for the execution of risk inventories at regular intervals, as well as for generating
and submitting reports to the Executive Board, the Audit Committee and the Supervisory
Board. Ongoing monitoring of the risk management system should ensure its effectiveness
in light of constantly changing conditions and also continuously improve the process in the
future.

e Corporate Central Functions

In consultation with the Executive Board, Corporate Central Functions perform specialist
monitoring tasks throughout the Group. They have wide-ranging obligations to request and
receive information, to intervene in some cases and to issue individually defined compe-
tences to issue guidelines, and be actively involved with their specialist colleagues in the
divisions / regions and subsidiaries. Corporate Central Functions partially assume primary
responsibility for risks or make tax-related interventions in the context of their Group-wide
functional supervision.

Third Line: Independent review

e In accordance with the Three Lines of Defense model, Corporate Internal Audit & Investi-
gations, as an independent monitoring body, has the task of regularly reviewing the effec-


--- Page 47 ---

Bilfinger SE
Annual Report 2021,

B_ Combined management report 98
B.3Risk and opportunity report

tiveness and appropriateness of the risk management system and the internal control sys-
tem on an incident-related or ad-hoc basis. The risk owner regularly monitors the evalua-
tion of the identified risks in order to determine significant changes.

As part of the audit of the annual financial statements, external auditors also carry out
a review of the appropriateness of the system in order to detect early threats to the con-
tinued existence of the Group.

In addition to the specific tasks and functions described above, the Principles of Risk Awareness,
which are Group-wide and binding, apply to all staff. These aim to ensure that only manageable
risks are taken. We promote risk awareness among employees by taking appropriate communica-
tion and training measures. Each employee is required to act responsibly in the handling of risks
and to immediately report any knowledge of risk-related behavior.

B.3.1.2 Identification
Risk identification is conducted continuously in the course of daily business processes. It includes
the regular and systematic analysis of internal and external developments and events that could
lead to negative deviations from underlying framework conditions.

In order to achieve comprehensive Group-internal transparency, risk identification is con-
ducted as part of an ongoing, institutionalized process:

As of the balance-sheet date, the following significant risks result from the parameters of impact
and likelihood: Directly following this, the Bilfinger Risk Committee convenes, performs quality as-
surance on the quarterly risk report and forwards it for processing in the Executive Board and for
submission to the Audit Committee.

Any significant risk is documented with a high degree of transparency and described compre-
hensibly. The description indicates cause and effect clearly.

The operating companies and divisions / regions as well as units at headquarters entrusted
with company-wide functional supervision immediately report relevant short-term risks to the re-
sponsible Corporate Central Functions and, if relevant, to the Executive Board.

In accordance with the COSO standard, the identified risks are assigned to four categories:
strategic risks, operational risks, financial risks and compliance risks. In this regard, the cause of a
risk is decisive for the categorization.

B.3.1.3 Evaluation

The basic risk assessment is carried out within the scope of the annual risk assessment workshops
of the divisions / regions. In this regard, the respective form of the risk (net) is determined while
also considering the risk mitigation measures currently implemented. Each risk is evaluated in five
defined levels using the parameters of effect and likelihood.

The evaluation primarily takes place using a qualitative approach. At times, an addi
etary evaluation is made. However, this is assigned a subordinate value.

The assessment of the effect and likelihood allows for risks to be prioritized and for necessary ac-
tion to be taken in order to manage risks. Here, a focus is on the 10 most significant risks.

Annual Report 2021,

B_ Combined management report 100
B.3_Risk and opportunity report

B.3.1.4 Control
Additional measures to manage risks, where reasonable and necessary, are taken on the basis of
risks that have been identified and evaluated. Depending on the scope and value, this takes place
in consultation with those in the companies defined as responsible for the risk management pro-
cess or according to line functions.

Bilfinger differentiates between four fundamental strategies to deal with individual risks:

e Avoid
Incalculable risks or risks with a disadvantageous risk-return ratio are avoided, for example by
not accepting projects in a high risk category or ensuring that these risks are explicitly elimi-
nated by means of contractual provisions.

e Transfer
Depending on the situation, risks are contractually transferred to third parties such as insurers,
subcontractors and customers outside the Group.

e Manage
Manageable risks or their impact are reduced or limited by better operational execution,
strengthened control or other risk mitigation measures (hedging etc.).

e Accept
Remaining risks are accepted as such in their current respective form whenever further risk
mitigation measures are not economically viable.

The costs and benefits will be taken into account in the selection of a control measure. Risk man-
agement is carried out within the business processes by the risk owner. The risk owner regularly
monitors the evaluation of the identified risks in order to determine significant changes. The risk
owner reviews the appropriateness of the implemented control measures for the risks assigned to
him, as well as the implementation of additional measures deemed necessary.

The transparency necessary to control risks is achieved by communicating significant risks in
the risk report, at least quarterly, to the Executive Board and to the Audit Committee of the
Supervisory Board. Risks from framework agreements in the services business relate primarily to
business in the engineering & maintenance sector.

B.3.2 Significant risks
Significant risks for Bilfinger are calculated on the basis of the described evaluation method. If risks
calculated as significant occur, this could lead to negative effects on our net assets and financial
position as well as on our reputation. The risks are presented on a net basis after risk mitigation
measures.

As of the balance-sheet date, the following significant risks result from the parameters impact

The individual risks compiled under semantically aggregated risk titles in the fields of strategic risks,
operational risks, financial risks and compliance risks are described in the following. Unless other-

wise stated, the risks presented affect the entire Group. Risks specific to business segments include

an appropriate indication.

Risks are monitored in accordance with COSO requirements. Additional risks with a lesser
meaning for the Bilfinger Group are also followed alongside identified significant risks. Obligatory
information, such as on risks from financial instruments, is explained in Chapter C.6.30 Risks from
financial instruments, financial risk management and hedging transactions.

B.3_Risk and opportunity report

B.3.2.1 Strategic risks

Adverse market developments

Bilfinger depends on the general economic situation and the development of its markets. Bilfinger
evaluates the risk from project and framework agreement risks in their effect overall as relevant.
Bilfinger is also smaller than a range of its customers, who try to exploit their relative market
strength, particularly in the context of new tenders.

In addition to this general situation and in light of continued major activities in the oil and gas
segment, Bilfinger — despite the ongoing expansion of its service portfolio including in areas such
as renewable energies and hydrogen technologies — is dependent on the development in the price
of oil and its effect on the spending behavior of customers in this market segment. Increasing
efforts to decarbonize operations can also tend to lead to a decline in demand in the oil and gas
sector.

Bilfinger continued to face restrictions in its operating business in reporting year 2021 as a
result of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, such as the limitation of occupancy capacities on
oil and gas platforms in the North Sea. These did not, however, have a significant impact on our
business activities.

In the course of the pandemic, Bilfinger last year prepared itself for a scenario in which the oil
price only returns to a historical level of between USS 55 and USS 75 per barrel in the medium
term. Fortunately, however, we saw a recovery in the price of oil to the level forecast in the 2021
reporting year. Development of the price of oil, its volatility in particular or even its longer-term
decline, remain a potential risk for our activities.

Furthermore, the efforts made at the end of financial year 2019 to make the organization more
efficient and agile are paying off, enabling Bilfinger to meet the ongoing challenges from a position
of greater agility and strength.

We continue to counter these risks by gradually strengthening our product range, by regularly
expanding the customer base and by actively managing productivity and capacity to minimize po-
tential sunk costs, in addition to intensive cooperation with customers. In general, Bilfinger’s strat-
egy targets a balanced distribution of the business between the six core industries and eight re-
gions.

A delay in planned projects in the area of nuclear energy represents an additional risk in the
development of our markets. A further risk lies in the scarcity of resources in the area of special
materials. Increases in raw material costs for our customers in the chemical sector, a long-term
increase in the price of oil, for example, could also have negative effects on their spending behavior
regarding investments and maintenance. The latter may be partially offset by additional revenue
in the oil and gas sector. And, not least, a further acceleration of the energy transition and a de-
parture from conventional energy, particularly in Germany, could lead to additional overcapacities
on the one hand, but also to additional opportunities in new sectors. However, the start of the
projects depends heavily on the duration of the approval processes or procedures for funding

Inflationary trends currently being observed could potentially lead to a reluctance on the part
of our customers to award projects, as economic viability may no longer be assured. This could
lead to a reduction in growth at Bilfinger.

Bilfinger counters the risk arising from adverse market developments through, among other
things, a highly diversified portfolio of customers and industries, whereby growth in sustainability
areas in particular will also be pursued. Overall, Bilfinger’s assessment of the risk from future ad-
verse market developments is unchanged compared with the previous reporting period and there-
fore remains within the range of possibility with a relevant impact.

B.3_Risk and opportunity report

Dependence on individual customers in some business sectors

Steady increases in inflation also cannot be readily carried over to the customer in full. A deterio-
ration or loss of customer relationships could have a negative impact on regional business or as-
sets.

In view of the necessary productivity increases, Bilfinger continues to assess the risk as relevant
in terms of its impact, with the likelihood being within the possible range. Our customer relation-
ships are also cultivated through effective customer relationship management. Overall, Bilfinger
continues to assess the risk of dependence on individual customers in some business segments as
low in terms of both likelihood and effect.

B.3.2.2. Operational risks

Risks from projects and framework agreements

When planning and executing projects, significant calculation and execution risks exist that are
often larger than in the service business due to the project volumes and higher degree of technical
complexity. Risks from the project business therefore relate primarily to the Technologies segment
but are becoming increasingly relevant for the maintenance and repair units due to the growing
project business.

Project orders involve the construction of new industrial production facilities or major over-
hauls, for example. Requirements that have not been fully anticipated, and resulting modifications,
delays, financial difficulties of our customers or suppliers, lack of skilled personnel, technical diffi-
culties, cost overruns, construction site conditions or changes to the project sites, weather influ-
ences or natural catastrophes, changes to the legal or political environment or logistical difficulties
can have a significant negative impact on the results of operations, net assets and financial position
of Bilfinger.

Bilfinger assumes significant technical guarantees for some orders in the project area. Plant
construction projects carried out in this way are often complex and require a large purchasing
volume and qualified project management. Such project contracts are typically concluded with the
obligation to provide turnkey construction of the plant. A key risk lies in the fact that the calculated
prices are inadequate for the contractual performance for diverse reasons (e.g., construction site
conditions, delays due to weather conditions, mistakes by subcontractors) and that further claims
cannot be obtained from the customer. This can result in a decreased profit margin and in some
cases can lead to significant losses from the contract.

The limitation of risks is a key task of the unit responsible for the individual project at Bilfinger.
There are thus minimum requirements which a project must fulfill in order to be accepted by the
responsible unit. Depending on the bid volume and specific risk categories, the independent cor-
porate departments of Project Compliance, Corporate Project Audit and Corporate Legal & Insur-
ance must be involved as additional supervisory authorities — until the Executive and Supervisory
Boards have given their approval.

Risk management begins with the targeted selection of the projects. In addition to the actual
task of the project, the experience with the client, conditions in the region in which the project is
to be carried out, the competence and capacity of the Group unit that will potentially do the work,
the schedule, project risks, the draft contract, the payment plan, payment security and resource
availability are analyzed. In the following bid phase, positive or negative deviations from the gen-
erally expected conditions are systematically listed. In the determination of costs, the calculation
initially assumes planned conditions. Positive or negative particularities are subsequently analyzed,
evaluated and transferred into significant projects in a quantitative risk analysis. The risk structure
is decisively taken into account in the final decision on the bid and its formulation. Furthermore, it


--- Page 53 ---

Bilfinger SE
Annual Report 2021,

B_ Combined management report 104
B.3_Risk and opportunity report

is consistently monitored by a central unit in accordance with defined regulations from the bid
phase through to the implementation, completion and processing of any warranty claims.

Risks from framework agreements in the services business relate primarily to business in the
engineering & maintenance sector. Here, we generally conclude contracts over a longer term,
which are primarily awarded in a highly competitive environment. The earnings margins attainable
in long-term contracts could deviate from the initial calculations as a result of changes from diverse
influences. In maintaining industrial plants, there is the risk that material and personnel costs or
legal requirements are not fully covered by the contractual revenue and thus have an impact on
the financial position.

The basis for the management of risks in the service sector is a profound understanding of the
customer, the services being provided and of the contract conditions that have been agreed. For
the execution of the work, our operative companies have competent, reliable and experienced
staff. Wage increases, which are partly influenced by external factors, primarily wage settlements,
will be partially absorbed by the indexing of contractual remuneration

In view of the high degree of involvement in the business processes of our customers, we pay
particular attention to the appropriate level of qualification of the persons assigned. Precise
knowledge of the specific conditions in the plants we manage is a decisive factor for our business
success. Service contracts above a certain volume must be subject to a regular review by Corporate
Project Audit over the contract period.

Bilfinger evaluates the risk from project and framework agreement risks in their effect overall
as relevant. On the basis of internal analyses, the likelihood of occurrence is currently assessed as
increased, which corresponds to an unchanged estimate compared with the previous year. This is
mainly due to project risks that occur and that cannot be completely avoided despite globally es-
tablished project governance and standardized project management processes.

Lack of adequate personnel

The market for skilled labor remains difficult, particularly for our business activities in Europe and
North America. There is therefore an ongoing risk that qualified and motivated personnel will leave
the Group. Another risk is posed by the failure to recruit relevant personnel due to increased com-
petition for qualified personnel and demographic change. Because the company relies on techni-
cally qualified and motivated employees in many business areas in order to be able to optimally
meet the requirements of its customers, the lack of skilled personnel could have a negative impact
on customer satisfaction. Insofar as this should affect the regular business and order acquisition,
negative effects on the net assets and financial position are possible. It is therefore vital that highly
qualified specialist and management personnel are recruited and retained by the company over
the long term.

We counter the risk of losing employees with targeted development and incentive systems.
This is achieved, among other things, by a thorough annual performance appraisal process, indi-
vidually tailored training opportunities and performance-related remuneration systems.

Overall, we counter human resources risks that could arise from a lack of young talent, fluctu-
ation, a lack of qualifications or the change in the workforce due to demographic development
with a broad range of measures that are described in the non-financial Group declaration in Chap-
ter 8.5.3.2 Employee development and diversity.

Overall, the situation on the labor market for skilled workers is becoming increasingly difficult,

which is why we have raised our assessment of the probability of occurrence by one level com-
pared with the previous year, with the impact remaining relevant.

COVID-19 pandemic

In the reporting year 2021, there was no significant impact on our business activities due to the
global COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence of new virus mutations, however, continues to gener-
ate increased uncertainty. One example is that COVID-19 protection measures could result in re-
duced production activities on oil and gas platforms, as well as possible travel restrictions and
quarantine obligations. In our view, however, a severe negative economic impact in our target
markets is not expected in the coming year. If, contrary to Bilfinger’s expectations, significant dis-
tortions in business activity were to occur again, this could certainly lead to material effects on the
Group’s net assets, financial position and results of operations, taking into account the elimination
of state compensation funds in particular.

In view of the global dimension and the limited predictability of the pandemic, Bilfinger will
continue to monitor the situation very closely and will make every effort to mitigate any negative
effects on the Group. These include, in particular, agility measures and comprehensive occupa-
tional safety and hygiene concepts for our employees.

Bilfinger currently assumes a relevant impact with a downward tendency. We consider the
probability of occurrence to be within the realm of possibility.

Serious HSEQ incident (Health, Safety, Environment and Quality)

As a service provider, we are almost exclusively active at the locations of our customers. In the
execution of our work, we place the highest possible demands on health, safety, and environmen-
tal protection as well as on the quality of the services provided. The ‘Zero Accidents’ vision is a
fixed component of our safety and corporate culture. At the same time, we urge our employees
to strictly comply with our customers’ safety requirements, though it is still not possible to prevent
all incidents.

Failures in environmental protection or in occupational health and safety that result in a seri-
ous incident could lead to adverse effects on our customer relationships through to a loss of orders
as well as contractual penalties and damage claims and could thus have a negative impact on the
net assets and financial position of the Group.

We counteract risks from quality defects by using far-reaching quality and process manage-
ment. It starts with the operating units, which are responsible for the process as well as the quality
of their services. Through system requirements and targets as well as internal audits, they work
toward the continued development of quality standards. To ensure this development, our pro-
cesses and units are externally audited and certified in accordance with the ISO EN 9001, ISO EN
14001 and ISO EN 45001 standards.

With an accident rate of 0.21 per 1,000,000 working hours, lost-day incidents are at an inter-
nationally leading level for our industry. Our 2021 global safety campaign “Line of Fire”, which
raised awareness of the Bilfinger Life Saving Rules among our employees and managers, was also
a contributing factor here. In the coming year, we will continue to focus intensively on work con-
tent as we continue this global safety campaign and help make ourselves even more successful.

Bilfinger’s assessment of the HSEQ risk as one of the most significant Group risks is largely
unchanged with a relevant effect on the earnings situation and a simultaneously lower likelihood
of occurrence.

Details on HSEQ management at Bilfinger are described in the non-financial Group declaration
in Chapters 8.5.3.2 Employee development and diversity, B.5.5.1 Customer focus and B.5.5.2 Qual-

ity management.

Insufficient agility

The achievement of our medium-term margin goals requires a significant increase in productivity
in both direct and indirect functions. By contrast, market and margin pressure remain high as cus-
tomers demand that any cost reductions achieved be passed on. Steady increases in inflation also
cannot be readily carried over to the customer in full. Newly accepted framework agreements in
the Engineering & Maintenance business segment are less profitable due to set-up costs and the
initial training necessary for a specific plant in the start phase.

Due to productivity improvements already achieved as well as the leaner organization, Bilfinger
assesses the risk in terms of its impact as low and therefore one level lower than in the previous
year, while the probability remains within the realm of possibility.

The situation requires constant and careful management of the cost base and regular review
of the status quo. Productivity management is initially the responsibility of all those with opera-
tional responsibility. To further support achievement of these goals, measures are being intensi-
fied within the Group to obtain new personnel resources from alternative sources and to train
them thoroughly in central training centers. Transparency regarding key resources is also being
increased Group-wide and flexibility is being enhanced.

To ensure an ongoing improvement in operating performance, Bilfinger continues to identify
so-called transformation units within the Group that are initially subject to increased monitoring
and undergo a comprehensive reorganization program.

IT-related risk

Information is a key component of our business processes and thus represents an important cor-
porate asset that must be protected in an appropriate manner against unauthorized access. The
ever-increasing global networking of computer systems, however, makes it increasingly difficult to
protect our information from abuse, manipulation, espionage or theft. This is a general trend in
the business world and Bilfinger is by no means immune to it. The most serious risk in this regard
is posed by hostile attacks on Bilfinger IT systems (so-called cyber attacks), which are becoming
increasingly prevalent as a result of increasing digitalization. These cyber attacks can have mali-
cious intent including disrupting processes, attempting to gain access to internal and confidential
information or even blackmailing to release data. The result can be significant system failures and
disruptions to operational processes.

In addition to these direct attacks on our systems, continued attempts are being made to use
IT-supported communication to entice employees to surrender company information or even to
pay out funds (known as phishing or spoofing).

We counter the risks in the cyber security environment with a broad package of measures,
such as increased monitoring of incoming and outgoing e-mail traffic to prevent malicious e-mails
with a cloud-based e-mail gateway. In the event of specific threats, we work together closely with
the relevant authorities. The central data centers were migrated to Microsoft Azure and will con-
tinue to be subject to ISO 27001 certification. In addition, measures to make network access more
stringent are checked by means of regular vulnerability analyses, e.g., through so-called friendly
hacking.

To monitor security-relevant events, Bilfinger uses a Security Information and Event Manage-
ment System (SIEM) which collects all central logs and evaluates them for anomalies. In addition,
training requirements have been defined for all employees with IT access to raise awareness with
regard to potential risks. In addition, the risk for Bilfinger was partially mitigated through the pur-
chase of cyber security insurance.

B.3_Risk and opportunity report

In addition to the risks from the cyber security environment mentioned above, risks relating to
potential breaches of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on the IT side are
also significant. Measures to comply with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regu-
lation with regard to the use of personal data in Bilfinger’s IT processes that may not have been
fully implemented could result in severe penalties if breaches are identified. In order to counteract
possible violations, Bilfinger has a uniform Group Data Protection Policy based on the regulations
of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and on globally accepted principles
of data protection law for the processing of personal data from employees, customers, suppliers
and other business partners. Compliance with the requirements is monitored by means of regular
audits, among other things.

Overall, Bilfinger classifies IT-related risks as having a low impact. We consider the probability
of occurrence to be within the realm of possibility.

B.3.2.3 Financial risks

Inadequate focus on working capital / cash management

Bilfinger lists significant working capital positions on the balance sheet, particularly in the area of
current and future customer requirements (services that have been provided but not yet invoiced)
Furthermore, Bilfinger’s business model involves substantial liabilities due to warranty and follow-
up costs as well as significant advance payments, particularly from the project business. The in-
volvement of suppliers and external staff that is typical of the business leads to substantial liabili-
ties from trade receivables. This results in Bilfinger normally being in a net position for accounts
receivable because the payment due dates for suppliers are often shorter than those of customers,
mainly due to temporary staff. This results in an imbalance which typically widens during the year.

With a view to Bilfinger’s growth plans, there is a risk that this imbalance continues to increase
in the future and that there will arise both an increased need of financing and additional costs to
finance this position. Moreover, an active management of working capital can also be identified
on the customer side, for example, in the even more restrictive interpretation of requirements for
milestones when billing. This can also lead to a further imbalance in relation to receivables and
liabilities, with corresponding additional costs for financing.

The mitigation measures focus on a consistent local management of receivables and liabilities,
which is formalized in the Group policy on minimum standards in working capital management, to
which all employees are bound. This extends comprehensively to the order-to-cash (OtC) and pur-
chase-to-pay (PtP) processes. In addition, the objective of the ongoing comprehensive process and
system harmonization within the Group is to contribute to greater transparency with regard to
improvement potential and an increased Group-wide exchange of best practices in working capital
management. In addition, there has been a Group-wide program at Bilfinger since 2019 to opti-
mize working capital management, including training and awareness measures as well as the def-
inition of specific measures in individual units. Significant improvements in order-to-cash demon-
strate the effectiveness of the program, which is why it will be continued in the future.

In addition to working capital, Bilfinger monitors all financial risks with proven control mecha-
nisms that allow for timely and transparent reporting. The Group’s reporting system guarantees
the regular identification, analysis, assessment and management of financial risks by Corporate
Treasury. All relevant equity interests and joint ventures are included in this monitoring.

As a result of an unexpected negative business development, increased financing needs can
occur in the operating units. At the same time, a negative business development can entail a
change in Bilfinger’s creditworthiness, particularly from rating agencies and banks, which can lead
to more difficult and expensive financing or a more difficult and expensive provision of securities

and guarantees. External financing can also result in a worsening of the dynamic gearing ratio that
was pledged to be maintained through the financial covenant. Any breach of the financial covenant
can lead directly or, through cross-default clauses, indirectly to the repayment call of all financing
on a recourse basis and can thereby also lead to an unplanned loss of liquidity.

We counter this risk by centrally monitoring liquidity development and risks in the Group using
an ongoing cash-flow planning and introducing countermeasures at an early stage. Within the con-
text of central financing, Bilfinger SE makes necessary liquidity available to its subsidiaries. Not-
withstanding economically less relevant regions, the Group’s internal equalization of liquidity in
Europe and in the United States is supported by cross-border cash pooling.

Investment financing is carried out with consideration of matching maturities. To finance work-
ing capital, we have a €250 million pre-approved syndicated credit line at attractive conditions that
is in place until December 2023. This includes a standard market financial covenant in the form of
a limitation of the dynamic gearing ratio adjusted net debt / adjusted EBITDA. The value as of
December 31, 2021, is below the contractually agreed cap. If, in the case of a significant worsening,
adjustment does not take place in agreement with the lender, any breach of the financial covenant
can lead directly or, through cross-default clauses, indirectly to the repayment call of all financing
on a recourse basis.

The sureties available for the execution of our project and service business with a volume of
€906 million are sufficiently dimensioned to accompany the further development of the company.
In addition, we have a U.S. surety program in the amount of USS 750 million for the execution of
our business in North America. All credit commitments can be called due prematurely in the case
of a change of control.

In addition, Bilfinger has issued a €250 million bond maturing in June 2024 and several prom-
issory note loans totaling €14.5 million maturing in April 2022 and October 2024.

Bilfinger’s assessment of the risk from insufficient progress on working capital management /
cash management remains unchanged with regard to possible occurrence and an impact classified
as low.

For a presentation of the risks we refer to Chapter C.6.30 Risks related to financial instruments,

financial risk management and hedging transactions. You will also find further information in Chap-

ter C.6.29 Additional information on financial instruments.

B.3.2.4 Compliance risks (including legal risks)

Legal disputes and completed legacy projects

In addition to the costs and expenses that arise as a result of legal disputes, there is also the risk
of financial loss arising from correct, incorrect or lengthy decisions on the part of courts or public
authorities.

Legal disputes predominantly arise from our provision of services. Controversies with custom-
ers mainly relate to claimed defects in our services, delays to completion or to the scope of services
provided. In such cases, there is often also a similar dispute with the subcontractors that were
used. We strive to avoid legal disputes wherever possible or to settle them at an early stage. This
goal cannot always be achieved, however, with the result that German and international compa-
nies are sometimes involved in litigation or arbitration. The outcome of such can of course not be
predicted with any degree of certainty, but is often dependent on inquiry or assessments on the
part of the courts. We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that the outcomes of litigation and
proceedings may deviate from our assessments and forecasts and that damages may occur to our
net assets and financial position.

In connection with an explosion incident at a gas station in Austria in 2017, the public prose-
cutor is investigating a Bilfinger company and other involved parties and has now filed charges.
The reason for the accident has not yet been determined. In the summer of 2019, an expert com-
missioned by the public prosecutor's office determined that the gas accident was due to technical
defects in the plant for which the relevant Bilfinger company was responsible. Another court-ap-
pointed expert basically concurred with this view on causation in the report he submitted in sum-
mer 2021. Bilfinger has disputed these findings. The main public hearing started in December
2021. From today’s perspective, we expect that in case of a civil law availment by injured parties,
we would, if necessary, have sufficient insurance coverage. In individual projects in various coun-
tries, clients, subcontractors, public authorities or consortium partners are asserting claims in the
mid triple-digit million-euro range against Bilfinger for various reasons. The objects of the disputes
are, among other things, the appointment of blame for the causes of construction delays, disrup-
tions to the construction process, defects and disagreements related to the technical features of
the plants. It was possible to bring large volume cases to a close in various countries over the
course of the 2021 reporting year.

Bilfinger is also asserting claims against customers in various countries for payment of out-
standing compensation claims in the mid double-digit million-euro range and sees opportunities
in this regard.

Overall, following careful examinations, we can assume that sufficient provisions have been
recognized in the balance sheet for all ongoing disputes and partially with counter-claims. How-
ever, it is still possible that the available provisions are insufficient as a result of the difficulty in
making projections or because capitalized receivables cannot be fully collected.

Due to the positive developments, Bilfinger assesses the risk from legal disputes and legacy
projects as relevant and therefore one level lower than in the prior year, with a simultaneous lim-
ited likelihood of occurrence.

B.3.3 General assessment of the risk situation
The evaluation of overall risk is the result of a consolidated consideration of all significant individual
risks. Bilfinger expects that the general risk situation of the Group in reporting year 2021 did not
change significantly as compared with the previous year.

The pandemic-related recession in the global economy was followed this year by a worldwide
economic upturn, during which the price of oil also rose again due to demand — in some cases even
exceeding pre-crisis levels — which benefited our business in the oil & gas sector in particular.

The challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be an issue that should
not be underestimated, although Bilfinger does not currently expect any major setbacks. Further-
more, Bilfinger was able to successfully conclude another major legal case in the fall of this year
without incurring any financial losses. At the same time, it is becoming apparent in some units that
risks in project execution can still have an impact as can an increasing scarcity of personnel re-
sources. The inflationary trends currently being observed could also have a negative impact on our
business if customers become more reluctant to award projects due to higher costs.

Overall, however, Bilfinger is convinced that the existing risks are sustainable for the Group as
a result of the instruments put in place to manage them.

In the past financial year, we did not identify any individual risks whose occurrence, either
alone or in combination, would have jeopardized the continuing existence of the Group or one of
its significant Group companies. If unpredictable, exceptional risks should occur, the possibility
that they would have an impact on the development of our sales or earnings cannot be ruled out
From today’s perspective, however, no risks can be identified that could threaten the existence of
the Group or one of its significant Group companies.

B.3.4 Opportunity management

B.3.4.1 Principles, identification, evaluation and control
We understand opportunities as potential positive deviations from our planning. Their occurrence
may have additional positive impacts on our net assets and financial position.

In its dynamic competitive environment, Bilfinger is presented with opportunities, both exter-
nally through new customer requirements, market structures or legal framework conditions, and
internally through new services, innovations, quality improvements and competitive differentia-
tion.

Opportunities are identified by Bilfinger’s employees and management in the course of their
daily processes and market observations. In addition, a strategic planning process at regular inter-
vals supports a fundamental annual analysis of the opportunities presented to us.

In the overall context of the company, opportunities that are considered advantageous to
Bilfinger’s development and, with it, to the interests of shareholders, should be — where it makes
financial sense — encouraged and realized using targeted measures. These are managed by estab-
lished planning and forecasting processes as well as by projects.

B.3.5 Significant opportunities
Significant opportunities for Bilfinger that are established on the basis of the described method
are present in the following areas:

Opportunities from tax matters

Advantageous market developments

Digitalization and business development

Positive outcomes of pending legal cases and disputes

Effective project and contract execution

Optimization of personnel availability and costs

Compliance and safety culture as a positive differentiation feature

ON DHAWNHB

Portfolio rotation (value contribution through the purchase and sale of companies and shares
in companies)

9 Accelerated implementation of productivity measures

10 Growth opportunities in sustainability areas

Like risks, the opportunities described below fall under the four core areas of the COSO framework
and generally relate to the entire Group. Segment-specific opportunities are declared as such.

B.3.5.1 Strategic opportunities

Advantageous market developments

Our strategic planning is based on certain assumptions with regard to the economic framework
conditions in our markets in Europe, the United States and the Middle East. If the actual develop-
ment deviates positively from this planning basis, it can lead to additional impetus on demand.

A substantial and sustainable increase in global market prices for fossil fuels beyond the level
that we assume in our strategic planning would, due to our substantial activities in this segment,
likely have additional positive effects on our business operations. An oil price that, over a longer
term, is above the profitability threshold of the respective extraction technologies used would re-
vive the investing activities of our customers. This would primarily impact the maintenance and
investment budgets in the Norwegian, British and U.S. oil and gas sectors.

An additional revival of demand in the area of nuclear energy as a result of targets on the
reduction of CO2 emissions could also open further earnings potentials in selected national mar-
kets.

Bilfinger considers additional opportunities in this area to be relevant, which is one level lower
than the previous year’s assessment. This is, however, against the background that additional pos-
itive market developments and additional growth opportunities in sustainable areas have been
reported separately since this year. We continue to assess the probability of occurrence of favor-
able market developments as low compared with the previous year.

Portfolio rotation
(value contribution through the sale of companies and shares in companies)
Operating units that are active outside the defined business segments, regions or industries are
allocated to the Other Operations segment. These units are not part of the strategic positioning of
the Group. Units with a positive earnings contribution are initially managed independently for
value until a suitable owner has been found.

In the case of the selling of these companies or for other strategic considerations, cash inflows
can have an additional positive effect on the liquidity of the Group and can be put to use for the


--- Page 61 ---

Bilfinger SE
Annual Report 2021,

B_ Combined management report 112
B.3_Risk and opportunity report

expansion of growth areas (portfolio rotation). With only two units remaining in this group as of
December 31, 2021, the impact of the opportunity is still considered low, with a low likelihood of
occurrence. Should it come to a sale with proceeds below the current carrying amount, this would
even be associated with a corresponding disposal loss. At the same time, the proceeds from the
sale of the preferred participation note to Apleona and the current financial position, as commu-
nicated, allow for acquisitions in the amount of several hundred million euros. Should the purchase
price be significantly lower than the value contribution of the asset, on a stand-alone basis or due
to synergies, this could have a positive impact on our net assets, financial position and results of
operations.

Growth opportunities in sustainability areas
Bilfinger has a comprehensive portfolio of products and services to help its industrial customers
achieve their sustainability objectives and to meet climate-protection targets.

We provide support through services in hydroelectric power and district heating, and in inno-
vative areas including the production of (green) hydrogen, carbon capture, utilization and storage
(CCUS), battery production or energy efficiency. In this context, Bilfinger is constantly developing
its capabilities so that it can better serve its customers along the entire value chain. A major part
of the growth opportunities in sustainability areas is already included in our planning, which is why
we assess additional opportunities beyond the planning as low, with a simultaneously low proba-
bility of occurrence.

B.3.5.2. Operational opportunities

Digitalization and business development

The digitalization of processes in our customer industries is being driven forward with a high de-
gree of commitment under the keyword ‘Industry 4.0’. We see ourselves as a full service provider
for the process industry in the development and ongoing enhancement of existing and new digital
solutions. We act as a liaison between industrial companies and pure IT providers. We want to
actively shape the transformation and, among other things, to contribute to enabling digitally net-
worked production, even for medium-sized companies. To this end, we have established a com-
petence center and make targeted investments in this area (see Chapter 8.2.7 Innovation (research
and development report). Furthermore, the Global Development Organization was established as
part of an organizational adjustment at the beginning of the 2020 financial year. This organization
reports directly to Bilfinger’s Chief Operating Officer and coordinates Group-wide business devel-
opment programs related to both new products and the greater integration of services across or-
ganizational boundaries. In the course of these efforts, the digital competence center was placed
under the control of the Global Development Organization. The objective is to more aggressively
market Bilfinger’s existing innovative products.

An accelerated customer demand for our digital solutions that goes beyond our underlying
planning can, along with an additional boost in growth, also lead to a business that can more easily
be scaled and thus to the use of economies of scale. Both can have a significant positive impact on
Bilfinger’s financial position. The perspective of opportunities that go beyond planning in this re-
gard includes relevant effects with a limited likelihood of occurrence.

Effective project and contract execution

Supplementary earnings opportunities arise from constant improvement of project execution and
the identification of additional potential contracts resulting from this. The realization of these po-
tentials relies on the nearly optimal application of project management processes and instru-


--- Page 62 ---

Bilfinger SE
Annual Report 2021,

B_ Combined management report 113
B.3_Risk and opportunity report

ments, which are also used in the mitigation of project risks. This also requires a profound under-
standing of the underlying contracts in each case. Bilfinger therefore utilizes professional project
managers with comprehensive experience and training. Bilfinger continues to assess the likelihood
of this opportunity occurring within the realm of possibility, while the impact, compared with the
previous reporting period, is one level lower and therefore considered low.

Optimization of personnel availability and costs

A positive deviation from the underlying planning on the availability of cost-efficient personnel
resources presents an opportunity for Bilfinger. In particular, the possibilities here are in a more
effective integration of qualified suppliers and subcontractors as well as in a moderate develop-
ment of labor and incidental wage costs in our focus regions. There are also additional modern
methods for personnel deployment as part of a better process and system landscape, among other
things, with regard to an even more effective administration of necessary training. Current
measures to further optimize personnel availability include the development of new source mar-
kets and training at central training centers, thus creating additional opportunities. Generally
speaking, however, the potential positive effects are considered low and thus unchanged com-
pared with the previous year. The likelihood of occurrence also remains within the realm of possi-

bility

Accelerated implementation of productivity measures

The achievement of our medium-term margin goals depends on a substantial increase in produc-
tivity in all areas of the Group. To this end, Bilfinger implemented significant further measures in
the prior year, also as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, to make personnel resources in partic-
ular more flexible. The Group also benefits from our internal Global Excellence Team, which is
responsible Group-wide for the establishment and implementation of additional productivity-en-
hancing measures.

Moreover, in the coming 12-18 months, more employee training on operational excellence
and lean management will be carried out in order to firmly establish the concept of ‘lean’ in the
organization and culture. We expect the improvement measures that have been initiated to take
effect and to contain relevant potential opportunities, but these have already been incorporated
to a significant extent in our medium-term planning.

Bilfinger continues to assess the probability of realizing relevant opportunities beyond this as
very low. If the measures can be implemented more quickly or effectively, this would generate
additional finance and earnings potentials for Bilfinger.

B.3_Risk and opportunity report

B.3.5.3 Financial opportunities

Opportunities from tax matters

In the Bilfinger Group there are substantial tax-loss carryforwards for which no deferred taxes have
been capitalized because the conditions pursuant to IFRS are not currently given. The majority of
these loss carryforwards is attributable to the German tax group of Bilfinger SE. Despite the posi-
tive taxable income of Bilfinger SE in 2021, no loss carryforwards have yet been capitalized as the
results are to a significant extent attributable to one-time items. In the event of a further increase
in profitability in the operating companies, non-capitalized loss carryforwards could be utilized,
thus improving the Group’s financial and earnings planning beyond the current planning.

Further opportunities from appeals against tax assessments following tax audits were realized
in 2021, as key aspects of the appeals were upheld. These effects led to an improvement in the
financial position, net assets and results of operations of the Bilfinger Group. Approximately two-
thirds of the expected income has also already been recognized. Further opportunities still exist in
a change in the valuation of the interest position.

With regard to the outstanding issues, the appeal proceedings are suspended until the highest
court decides on these legal questions. These additional effects have a much smaller material
scope. The prospects of success are in some cases good and in others considered to be rather low.
Overall, Bilfinger estimates the additional expected effects from tax matters to be low, with an
increased probability of occurrence.

B.3.5.4 Compliance opportunities

Positive outcomes for pending legal cases and disputes

Bilfinger’s business activities occasionally lead to disputes with customers concerning the appro-
priateness of certain requirements. There are relevant balance-sheet provisions in place for Bilfin-
ger’s current expectations. Should the processes end more favorably than currently expected, this
would, in some instances, provide significant potentials for our net assets and financial position
Here we see opportunities primarily in our European units.

In addition, Bilfinger is asserting claims against customers in various countries for payment of
outstanding compensation claims in a combined double-digit million amount. If these claims can
be asserted, this would also have a positive effect on the Group’s net assets and financial position.

Overall, the opportunity from pending legal cases and disputes is seen as having a low effect
and a possible probability of occurrence.

Compliance and safety culture as a positive differentiation feature

Our customers place a greater focus on compliance and HSEQ performance when choosing their
partners. In light of the measures for optimization of integrity and HSEQ culture described in Chap-
ter B.5.2.2 Counteracting corruption and bribery, Bilfinger rigorously meets these requirements
and can gain an important positive differentiation feature in the competitive environment. This is
proven by the contracts awarded to Bilfinger, for which the compliance system was an important

factor in the customer's decision. This trend opens up additional growth and earnings potential for
us. The opportunity from this is still considered small in terms of its effect. This also applies to the
probability of occurrence.

B.3.6 General assessment of the opportunities situation

Our current planning for 2022 and beyond already provides for a substantial improvement in the
Group’s net assets, financial position and results of operations through the realization of possible
opportunities, meaning that further opportunities beyond this planning tend to be limited


--- Page 64 ---

Bilfinger SE
Annual Report 2021,

B_ Combined management report 115
B.3_Risk and opportunity report

Compared with the prior year, Bilfinger’s overall opportunity situation has weakened some-
what because relevant elements of the opportunities have already been realized, in particular with
the sale of the preferred participation note to Apleona. Inflows from the sale as well as the current
financial situation do, however, offer the opportunity for potential acquisitions, which in turn could
generate positive value added for the Group. As a result of the economic upturn, the oil price has
also risen sharply recently and was quoted above the pre-crisis level, which has benefited our oil
& gas business. In addition, Bilfinger offers a comprehensive portfolio of services and products in
sustainability areas, which is why we also see potential for additional growth here.

Irrespective of this, Bilfinger continues to work on the ongoing development of its opportuni-
ties portfolio, including through the established BTOP platform.

B.3.7 Internal control and risk management system as relates

to the accounting process

The primary objective of our internal control and risk management system as relates to the
accounting and consolidation process is to ensure orderly financial reporting in terms of conform-
ity of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report of the Bilfinger
Group as well as the consolidated financial statements of Bilfinger SE as a parent company with all
relevant regulations.

Accounting process

Our consolidated financial statements are produced based on a centrally predetermined concep-
tual framework. This primarily comprises uniform requirements in the form of accounting guide-
lines and an account framework. Continual analysis is carried out to determine whether adaptation
of the conceptual framework is necessary as a result of changes in the regulatory environment.
The departments involved in accounting are informed of current topics and deadlines to be met
which affect accounting and the preparation of financial statements on a quarterly basis or, when
necessary, also ad hoc.

The financial statements provided by Bilfinger SE and its subsidiaries form the data basis for
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Accounting at the Bilfinger Group is gen-
erally organized in a decentralized manner. Accounting tasks are mainly undertaken by the con-
solidated companies on their own responsibility, or are transferred to one of the Group’s shared
service centers. In some cases, such as the evaluation of pension obligations, we call upon support
from external qualified service providers. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in
the consolidation system on the basis of the reported financial statements.

The accuracy of the accounting process is supported by appropriate staffing and material
equipment, the use of adequate software, implemented process controls as well as a clear defini-
tion of areas of responsibility. The accounting process is also supported by quality assurance con-
trol and monitoring mechanisms (for example plausibility controls, the dual control principle, au-
dits performed by Corporate Compliance / Corporate Internal Control Systems (ICS) as well as Cor-
porate Internal Audit & Investigations), which aim to expose and prevent risks and errors.

Internal control and risk management system

Taking into account legal requirements and customary industry standards, Bilfinger has established
a Group-wide internal control system (ICS) for the identification and mitigation of potential risks.
This system is continuously expanded and developed. The internal control system consists of prin-
ciples, procedures and measures to secure the effectiveness, efficiency and accuracy of the com-
pany’s accounting as well as the observance of applicable legal requirements. This also includes


--- Page 65 ---

Bilfinger SE
Annual Report 2021,

B_ Combined management report 116
B.3_Risk and opportunity report

the internal auditing system insofar as it relates to accounting. On this basis, the observance of
fundamental controlling principles such as separation of tasks and functions, four-eyes principle
or lawful access regulations in the IT systems will be ensured for the accounting and consolidation
process. The ICS at the Bilfinger Group for both the companies included and for the consolidation
is based on the COSO standard 2017.

The basic structure of the ICS includes the five core business processes purchase-to-pay,
order-to-cash, hire-to-retire, investment-to-disposal and financial reporting. The controls embed-
ded in the financial reporting process relate to both the accounting process in the included com-
panies as well as the consolidation. The key risks have been identified for these business processes
and necessary correlating controls are defined within the framework of a risk control matrix. This
structure represents the Group-wide binding ICS standard.

The internal control and risk management system designed and implemented at Bilfinger with
regard to the Group accounting process consists of the following significant features:

e The IT systems used in accounting are protected from unauthorized access through appropri-
ate security measures.

e Uniform accounting is defined in Group-wide guidelines, which are regularly updated.

e Accounting data is randomly reviewed on a regular basis for completeness and accuracy. Pro-
grammed plausibility audits are carried out by software that is designed for that purpose.

e Appropriate controls have been implemented for all accounting-relevant processes (including
the dual-control principle, functional separation and analytical audits). They are also regularly
reviewed by Corporate Compliance / Corporate Internal Control System (ICS)

e Onthe basis of the reports received from the external auditors and from Corporate Compliance
/ Corporate Internal Control System (ICS), the Supervisory Board, through its Audit Committee,
reviews the functionality of the internal control and risk management system as relates to the
accounting process.

The methodical support of the ICS is organized in accordance with the structure of the Group.
Responsible persons for the ICS are determined at a Group, regional or division and company level
Their tasks include reporting on the status of the ICS to the respective management, which has
overall responsibility for the ICS, and supporting the implementation of further development of
the system.

The effectiveness of the internal control system is monitored through annual effectiveness
checks (tests). The tests are carried out by Corporate Compliance / Corporate Internal Control
System (ICS) and by the units themselves (control self-assessments). By means of regular training
measures, it is ensured that all those involved in the internal control system have current and valid
information available. This forms the basis for the evaluation of the appropriateness and effective-
ness of the Group-wide control system by the Executive Board at the end of the financial year.
Recommendations for improvement become part of the ongoing development of the internal con-
trol system.

Within the scope of the internal control and risk management system with regard to the ac-
counting and consolidation process, Bilfinger has taken the measures described above for the iden-
tification and evaluation of risks such as the inappropriate exercise of assessment latitude as well
as violations against standards and regulations. The requirement of a conceptual framework and
the establishment of quality-assuring control and monitoring mechanisms in particular serve to

limit risks that exist with regard to the Group accounting processes. Given their inherent limita-
tions, however, internal controls cannot completely prevent potential errors in the Group account-
ing process and do not provide absolute certainty with regard to the achievement of control ob-

jectives.

B.4 Outlook

B.4 Outlook

B.4.1 Economy as a whole

Recent high infection rates led to renewed restrictions for contact-intensive service industries in-
cluding tourism and hospitality in Europe and the U.S. as 2021 drew to a close. With setbacks in
the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, economic risks have begun to intensify again. The euro
zone and the USA can both expect real economic growth of just over 4 percent in 2022 (DG ECFIN,
p. 154). This development is conditional, however, on the COVID-19 pandemic remaining under
control, also with regard to new virus mutations, and on the current supply bottlenecks and dis-
ruptions in global logistics gradually easing. In this case, growth momentum may be supported by
continued strong business investment and catch-up effects. In Europe, the start-up of project fi-
nancing from the EU reconstruction plan is providing growth impetus through additional invest-
ment in digital infrastructure and the energy transition. One risk to the economic outlook is the
development of inflation: If inflationary pressure proves to be unexpectedly persistent, the Euro-
pean Central Bank could be forced to scale back its monetary policy support for the recovery
through its securities purchases and zero interest rate policy earlier than expected. The develop-
ment of the oil price will be heavily dependent on global economic developments. The price of oil
is likely to be stable in the scenario of a further broad-based recovery of the global economy, but
more volatile again in the event of economic setbacks.

Engineering & Maintenance Europe

The European industrial services market will experience further structural growth impetus in the
coming years from the ambitious climate policy under the European Green Deal. The new tighter
European and national emission reduction targets, combined with further increases in CO2 prices,
will lead to significant investment in the decarbonization of European industry. Industry will invest
extensively in energy efficiency improvements, distributed generation and innovative carbon cap-
ture and storage processes. The chemical & petrochemical sector is expected to grow +1.5 percent
in Europe in 2022 (VCI Business Worldwide).

A key role in the industry’s gradual phase-out of fossil energy will be played by the production
and use of climate-neutral hydrogen. The EU and its member states are providing considerable
support for the development of a European hydrogen value chain through the European Hydrogen
Strategy and national funding instruments. In addition to the USS 37 billion in public funding al-
ready committed internationally, announced private sector investments total USS 300 billion
(FAZ). In the EU, there are already more than 400 funding projects in 18 countries (BMWI IPCEl)
These projects relate to the production of hydrogen, the infrastructure from transport to storage
and the applications in industry and mobility. In Germany, the new federal government has set
itself the goal of making the country the lead market for hydrogen technologies. More than 60 ma-
jor projects have been selected for funding under the national hydrogen strategy (BMWI IPCEI). In
this transformation process, there is increasing demand from industry for integrated services to
create the hydrogen infrastructure on site and to adapt plants and processes to the new energy
carrier. Industrial service providers are increasingly becoming industry's transformation partners
here.

Another trend in the context of the Green Deal with high potential for European industrial
services relates to electromobility and the surge in demand for batteries. Extensive investments in

new European battery factories have started, and even more are at the planning stage. A total of
40 projects have been announced for the next 10 years, 17 of them — with a total investment of
€25.5 billion — already have a concrete financing concept (Handelsblatt Elektromobilitat). The EU
and its member states are promoting these investments in order to reduce dependence on the
import of batteries from Asia. Not least, recent experience with the possible unreliability of global
supply chains has increased the willingness of policymakers and industry to secure sufficient pro-
duction capacity for strategically important products at European locations (Ltin, p. 46).

In view of these very positive long-term demand-side trends and the high level of technical
expertise required, the shortage of skilled workers will increasingly prove to be a restricting factor
for growth opportunities in the European services market. In industry surveys, the lack of qualified
personnel is ranked first as the most important obstacle to business development in the medium
term, ahead of other limiting factors such as growing price and competitive pressure (Lin, p. 37).

United Kingdom
Due to the low level of exploration activity in recent years, a further decline in oil and gas produc-
tion in the UK production fields is inevitable. For oil production, the UK Oil & Gas Authority expects
crude oil production to decline by 25 percent and gas production to decline by 15 percent in the
years from 2021 to 2025 (UK Oil&Gas PEP). However, if oil prices remain stable, exploration activ-
ities are expected to pick up again slightly. In the short term, the business will also benefit from
catch-up effects. For example, projects to decommission production facilities that were postponed
during the COVID-19 pandemic are gradually being caught up. In addition, expenditures to extend
the service life of existing plants in particular are expected to increase. A permanently growing role
will be played by carbon capture and storage projects, with which the oil industry aims to contrib-
ute to climate neutrality in the UK.

The country is already the world’s largest offshore wind power producer with its capacity of
10 gigawatts. This capacity is expected to quadruple by 2030 (OGUK Business Outlook). With in-
vestment recently hampered by supply bottlenecks and input price increases, demand for inspec-
tion and maintenance is expected to rise in light of high public and private investment.

Scandinavia

On the Norwegian Shelf, oil and gas production is still expected to increase slightly until 2025, after
which it is forecast to decline gradually (Norwegian Petroleum). Although the new government,
which took office in 2021, intends to continue to allow new developments of production fields in
the oil industry, the energy policy focus is on an expansion of offshore wind energy and on the
further development of green hydrogen production (Reuters, Windpower).

Chemical and petrochemical industries in Scandinavia are benefiting from a sharp increase in
the willingness on the part of the companies there to invest, with a focus on petrochemicals, bat-
tery chemistry and the hydrogen economy (GTAI Norway). Significantly lower electricity prices
than in Western Europe are boosting development in addition to the expected global recovery of
the chemical markets.

B.4 Outlook

Belgium / the Netherlands

Belgian pharmaceutical sites play a key role in the European production of COVID-19 vaccines and
will consequently also benefit substantially from the associated ongoing upswing in the biopharma
sector. The Belgian government presented its hydrogen strategy in the fall of 2021, according to
which it will further expand the country’s European role in hydrogen technology and develop the
infrastructure for the necessary hydrogen imports (Allan & Overy).

The chemical industry, together with the pharmaceutical sector, will remain Belgium’s indus-
trial backbone. In 2022, this significant chemical hub, with its excellent integration into global
chemical logistics, is expected to benefit strongly from the anticipated global recovery of customer
industries. Future growth is also backed by substantial investments currently underway in propyl-
ene and ethylene production capacity in the Antwerp cluster (GTAI Belgium).

The Netherlands expects to gain a particular advantage from the know-how and infrastructure
of the existing gas industry when switching to green hydrogen. This infrastructure offers potential
for conversion to hydrogen, which will require significant investment on the part of the industry
(GTAI Netherlands Hydrogen).

Dutch chemical companies’ expectations for 2022 are optimistic, despite supply chain issues.
40 percent of chemical companies expect sales to increase, with only 3 percent expecting a decline
in sales (GTAI Netherlands Industry Check)

Germany

Higher growth rates are also expected for the German market for outsourced industrial services in
the coming years than in previous years, which were still strongly characterized by the loss of im-
portance of the fossil power plant market. Partly as a result of the catch-up effects following the
COVID-19 recession, the services sector is expecting strong revenue growth of 11 percent in 2022
and then further strong growth rates of 8 percent in subsequent years (Ltn, p. 13). The climate
policy of the new German government is expected to provide additional impetus. Under the coa-
lition agreement, the new federal government will make the expansion of renewable energies a
central project of its work. Offshore wind energy in the North Sea and Baltic Sea is to be expanded
toacapacity of at least 70 gigawatts by 2045 (Coalition Agreement). The expansion of modern gas-
fired power plants to safeguard the energy turnaround is to be accelerated, and these are to be
convertible to climate-neutral gases at a later date. The import and transport infrastructure for
green hydrogen will be expanded. Although the deadline for the phase-out of coal-fired power
generation has not yet been set as binding, according to the coalition agreement, the phase-out
should “ideally” be brought forward to 2030 (Coalition Agreement, p. 5). With the exception of the
business associated with the indispensable flexible gas-fired power plants, the service market for
fossil-fired power plants in Germany will thus finally become a phase-out model.

The German chemical and pharmaceutical industry is concerned that production will continue
to be hampered by a lack of upstream products and disruptions to global logistics until at least the
summer of 2022. The industry is also concerned about the very sharp price increases for electricity
and gas, which can only be passed on to customers with a delay and not in full. Nevertheless, in
view of the good order situation, the industry association VCI expects production to increase by
2 percent and sales by 5 percent in 2022 (VCI balance sheet).

B.4 Outlook

Austria / Switzerland
The chemical and pharmaceutical locations in Switzerland and Austria continue to have high po-
tential in the coming years due to high productivity and innovative capacity.

The 2021 breakdown of negotiations between Switzerland and the EU on a comprehensive
framework agreement could hinder the integration of Swiss industry into the EU internal market
in the coming years (BAK). It is true that the existing bilateral agreements currently still provide a
good basis for largely smooth trade in the single market. However, without a contractual follow-
up solution, there would no longer be continuous alignment with changing EU standards. This
would create increasing obstacles for exports and imports by Swiss industry. However, further ne-
gotiations are to be expected here because both sides have a strong interest in a pragmatic solu-
tion.

The Austrian chemical industry, almost two-thirds of whose exports go to the EU’s internal
market (CEFIC), will benefit strongly from the expected industry recovery in Europe due to this
interdependence. However, high energy costs and problems in the supply chains also remain key
challenges for the medium-sized Austrian chemical industry in 2022.

Poland

Poland’s chemical industry plans to expand its already significant investment activity by 15 percent
in 2022 (GTAI Poland supply bottlenecks). Extensive investments continue to take place in both
chemicals and petrochemicals. However, supply bottlenecks for important components, a short-
age of skilled workers and high energy costs are hampering investment activity. Important EU-
funded support programs in the area of infrastructure development and energy transformation
could be delayed due to the conflict between the Polish government and the EU over the rule of
law. If the country were to permanently lose parts of the promised high payments from the regular
EU budget and the EU’s COVID-19 reconstruction plan, this would lead to a clouding of investment
dynamics in the country (GTAI Poland EU membership).

Engineering & Maintenance International

North America

Chemicals and petrochemicals are expected to expand robustly in the USA in 2022 with growth of
5 percent (VCI Business Worldwide). The expected positive development will be favored by the
abundant availability of energy at prices that are competitive by international standards. In addi-
tion, the extensive economic stimulus programs that have been launched are leading to substantial
additional demand in the construction chemicals sector. In addition, as in Europe, significant in-
vestments in battery factories are taking place due to the turn toward electromobility, with a grow-
ing demand for battery chemicals (GTAI US Chemie).

Although recovering oil and gas prices are leading to a short-term stabilization of investments
in the oil and gas sector, the longer-term outlook for the sector is uncertain given the country’s
climate policy objectives (GTAI Oil and Gas Fracking). On the financing side, growing investor re-
luctance to finance fossil activities is weakening future development opportunities. On the path to
reducing emissions, industry investment is increasing for the capture and industrial use of associ-
ated gases from extraction. In addition, the volume of projects for carbon storage in former oil and
gas reservoirs is growing.

B.4 Outlook

Middle East

The region’s population growth is accompanied by a continued sharp rise in demand for electricity.
This is creating stable demand for services to upgrade and build new power plants. The strategic
objective of oil producers in the Gulf to reduce their one-sided dependence on oil revenues is
accompanied by extensive investment in the expansion of downstream industries, the use of re-
newable energy sources and nuclear power. Among fossil fuels, the region’s producers will rely
more heavily on gas in the future and will be extensively expanding their export infrastructure for
liquefied natural gas.

Technologies

In France, the United Kingdom, Finland and some Eastern European countries, the construction of
new nuclear power plants is part of national energy strategies on the road to climate neutrality.
These investments and the ongoing work to modernize and extend the operating lives of existing
nuclear plants will result in a stable market for services in the coming years.

In the German market, demand for dismantling services for nuclear power plants will continue
to rise in the coming years. At the end of 2021, the Grohnde, Gundremmingen C and Brokdorf
nuclear power plants will be decommissioned. The three newest German plants, Isar 2, Emsland
and Neckarwestheim 2, will be shut down by the end of 2022 at the latest (German government)
In view of the long periods required for the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant, this means
that the development of this market is predictably stable over a time horizon of more than a dec-
ade. The current provisions of power plant operators for dismantling amount to €21.6 billion (year-
end 2020). Of this amount, €5.5 billion is earmarked for actual dismantling and €7.6 billion for
residual material processing and packaging (German Bundestag). These figures provide reliable
indications of the importance of this market segment to be expected in the coming years.

The biopharma industry is likely to experience a further boost thanks to its successes in the
COVID-19 pandemic. Not only has the willingness of venture capitalists to finance innovative meth-
ods grown strongly. Even more, digitization and innovative new trial methods have greatly in-
creased the speed of clinical trials (Evaluate, p. 4). These learning effects will shorten the time to
approval of innovative drugs.

B.4.2 Assumptions

COVID-19 pandemic

The pandemic continues to generate an increased level of uncertainty throughout the world. Our
outlook, however, is based on the assumption that it will not have a material impact on our busi-
ness activities in the course of financial year 2022. More detailed information can be found in
Chapter 8.3 Risks and opportunities report as well as in Chapter C.6.15.1 Goodwill.

Russia-Ukraine conflict

After the end of the reporting year, Russia launched an attack on Ukraine. Bilfinger’s business ac-
tivities in Russia and Ukraine are very limited and the conflict therefore has no significant direct
impact on the Group’s economic situation. It is, however, currently not possible to assess the short
and medium-term consequences of the conflict, in particular regarding its length and any potential
sanctions or further escalations, which means that uncertainties exist with regard to further de-
velopments.

Oil price
We expect the oil price to fluctuate between USS 60 and USS 80 per barrel in 2022

Competitive situation

We continue to expect intense competition in our business segments. In addition to its direct im-
pact on the macroeconomic environment, the COVID-19 pandemic has also led to growing price
sensitivity on the part of our customers. This is already included in our planning, and we are coun-
tering it with the cost-cutting and efficiency-enhancing measures described above. In consultation
with our customers, we identify potential savings to relieve the pressure on their overall budgets.

Currency effects

We are subject to currency translation effects, primarily with regard to the U.S. dollar including
the currencies influenced by the dollar in the Middle East, as well as with regard to the British
pound, the Norwegian krone, the Polish zloty and the South African rand. Our planning is based on
the assumption that the exchange rates will be within the range of the average level from 2020.

Brexit

In addition to possible impacts on currency developments and overall economic demand, Brexit
does not have any significant specific risks for our business because value creation in the United
Kingdom takes place nearly entirely within the country itself. No significant impact is expected on
the major Hinkley Point C project, either.

B.4 Outlook

Inflation
Bilfinger expects moderate cost increases in the medium term which can be passed on at least in
part to customers, in particular with regard to wage developments in the main markets.

B.4.3. Expected business development in 2022
Based on the assumptions above, we expect business to develop as follows in financial year 2022:

OUTLOOK 2022 Initial situation Outlook

financial year 2021 financial year 2022
Revenue €3,737.4 million significant growth
EBITA €121.2 million significant operational improvement
EBITA margin 3.2% significant operational improvement
Free cash flow €114.7 million at prior-year level

The positive development of revenue and earnings is expected to continue in 2022. It is anticipated
that Bilfinger’s growth will be accompanied by further earnings improvements in all three seg-
ments. We now measure this on the basis of EBITA and the EBITA margin, and no longer — as was
the case in the reporting year — on the basis of adjusted figures, a clear indication that the trans-
formation and restructuring phases have now been completed.

Revenue
For 2022, the Bilfinger Group expects significant revenue growth (2021: €3,737.4 million).

In the Engineering & Maintenance Europe segment, revenue (2021: €2,517.7 million) will grow
slightly following a strong recovery in the reporting year, with growth potential limited by the per-
sonnel resources that are currently available, particularly in Germany, Belgium/Netherlands and
Poland

By contrast, Engineering & Maintenance International (2021: €553.3 million) is expected to
achieve significant revenue growth from a very low level. Key factors here will be the progress in
implementing the strategy to expand both the service business as well as the continued focus on
smaller and medium-size projects.

At Technologies, a significant increase in revenue (2021: €559.9 million) is also expected due
to the high order backlog and continued strong development of the nuclear power and biopharma
markets.

In Other Operations (2021: €167.2 million), revenue is expected to be significantly below the
level of the previous year due to deconsolidation effects.

Order backlog as of December 31, 2021, amounted to €2,946.3 million for the Group. We ex-
pect that most of this amount will translate into revenue in 2022.

EBITA

The special items required in the past for transforming the Group will no longer be incurred in a
significant amount from 2022 as these processes were largely completed in 2021. Bilfinger is there-
fore now focusing on reported EBITA as the key earnings indicator. Here, the Group expects a
significant increase (2021: €121.2 million). The absence of restructuring charges will also signifi-
cantly increase the EBITA margin. In this context, the gains from the disposal of property and real
estate incurred in the reporting year will be offset by improved operating results in 2022.


--- Page 74 ---

Bilfinger SE
Annual Report 2021,

B_ Combined management report 125
B.4 Outlook

For Engineering & Maintenance Europe (2021: €115.5 million), Bilfinger anticipates a stable
operating performance. Overall, the segment’s EBITA margin will improve significantly due to the
fact that restructuring expenses will no longer be incurred in 2022. At Engineering & Maintenance
International (2021: -€17.6 million), EBITA is anticipated to increase significantly to at least break-
even due to higher capacity utilization. A further significant improvement in EBITA is also expected
at Technologies (2021: €19.2 million)

For the items summarized in the Reconciliation Group (2021: €4.1 million), we expect EBITA in
2022 to be significantly lower than in the reporting year, when it was strongly impacted by gains
on real estate and property disposals. Excluding this effect, a generally stable level is expected.

Net profit

As with EBITA, the reported figure for net profit will also be regarded as the primary measure from
financial year 2022. Due to a financial result without positive special items and a normalized tax
rate, it will be significantly lower than the figure for the reporting year (2021: €129.5 million) de-
spite improved EBITA.

Return on capital employed

In 2022, we expect a slightly lower return on capital employed after taxes despite significantly
improved EBITA, because the figure in the reporting year (2021: 7.4 percent) was positively influ-
enced by special items from taxes.

Free cash flow

We anticipate free cash flow in 2022 to be at the good level of the reporting year (2021: €114.7
million), which was influenced by positive cash inflows from real estate disposals and tax refunds.
This will be offset by increased operating cash flows in 2022.

Investments in property, plant and equipment
We expect investments in property, plant and equipment to be slightly above the sustainable level
of 1.5 percent of sales in 2022 due to investments undertaken to support growth.

Financing

We have a syndicated cash credit line of €250 million available which is due in December 2023.
We expect that the limit defined in the loan agreement for the financial covenant (dynamic gearing
ratio = adjusted net debt / adjusted EBITDA) will be maintained at all times.

B.4 Outlook

General statement from the Executive Board of Bilfinger SE on the anticipated
development of the Group

In financial year 2022, we expect a positive development of the Bilfinger Group, although increased
inflation and the lack of availability of skilled workers pose particular challenges in individual mar-
kets. We generally assume that the competitive situation will remain intense. In financial year
2021, Bilfinger clearly demonstrated that the company is very well positioned, particularly in Eu-
rope, to continue growing profitably.

At the same time, in 2021 we managed to successfully conclude measures that had originally
been planned for the longer term. Not least among these were the finalized harmonization of
Group-wide ERP systems, a further reduction in the number of legal entities and the disposal of a
further unit in Other Operations.

It is thus wholly consistent to formulate the earnings forecast for the coming year 2022 on the
basis of the key performance indicators EBITA and EBITA margin, and no longer — as was the case
in the reporting year — on the basis of adjusted figures, a clear indication that the transformation
and restructuring phases have now been completed. This puts us in a strong position to achieve
our targets for financial year 2022 — to significantly grow revenue in the financial year while at the
same time significantly improving the EBITA margin at operating level.

In addition to higher profitability, we will also continue to focus our attention on sustainably
increasing our free cash flow. The measures initiated to further reduce costs and improve cash
flow generation will be important factors when it comes to achieving our medium-term targets.
