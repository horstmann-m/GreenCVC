Somfy - Annual financial report 2015

MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT
TO THE COMBINED GENERAL MEETING OF 24 MAY 2016

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In accordance with legal and regulatory provisions in force, the Management Board has convened you here in order to inform you on the
management of your company and its subsidiaries and to submit for your approval the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.

Somfy Group is the global leader in opening and closing automation for both residential and commercial buildings.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR

DISPOSAL OF CIAT

On 5 January 2015, Somfy SA transferred its 46.1% equity investment
in the share capital of CIAT Group to United Technologies Corporation.
The transaction was worth €117 million, including €38 million related
to the disposal price of the securities, excluding costs, and €79.4 million
for the redemption of the CIAT bond issue originally subscribed to by
Somfy.

The payment of the transfer price includes a deferred portion totalling
€10.5 million spread between 2016 and 2019.

The disposal generated a consolidated net capital gain of €5.9 million
in 2015.

Pursuant to IFRS 5, the impact of the disposal on the income state-
ment, the balance sheet and the cash flow statement has been high-
lighted in specific lines in 2014 and 2015.

CANCELLATION OF FAAC SHARES

In May 2015, Faac and Somfy Groups concluded that there were no
joint development projects and therefore decided to undo the existing
capital links (Somfy’s 34% holding in the share capital of Faac and Faac’s
7.3% stake in Somfy).

The transaction to unwind their mutual equity interests involved the
exercise of a statutory right to withdraw and thus gave rise to the
cancellation of the Faac shares held by Somfy. As consideration for
this, the 571,400 Somfy shares held by Faac were returned to Somfy
and a compensation balance of €50.7 million was set, the payment of
which included a deferred amount of €13.2 million spread over 2016
and 2017.

This transaction generated a financial income of €35.7 million, net of
expenses, and is reflected in the cash flow statement by the collection
of €150.8 million related to the exit of the Faac securities and a move-
ment of -€115.7 million involving Somfy SA treasury shares.

In addition, some of the returned Somfy shares (436,800 shares) have
been cancelled to restrict the percentage of the share capital held
by Somfy to 7.2%. As a result, the share capital of Somfy comprises
7,400,000 shares with a par value of €1 each, including 535,880
treasury shares at 31 December 2015.

RETURN OF GAREN’S USUFRUCT

During June, the Group decided to return the usufruct in the share
capital of Garen Automagao without consideration. This transaction
was unwound on 14 July 2015 from a legal perspective and as a result
Somfy SA returned to its initial position of bondholder. The decision
can be explained by the deterioration of the economic situation in
Brazil and by the current problems of Garen Automagao’s owners.
The deconsolidation took place during the third quarter, leaving Somfy
with the residual financial risk of non-collection of its financial receiv-
ables despite agreement on the rescheduling of repayment over a
six-year period (2021). In this regard, and as a precaution, the annual
financial statements include a writedown to cover the maximum risk.
The exit of Garen Automagao had a negative impact of €12.4 million
on net financial income and also affected sales (2014 second-half sales
were €11.4 million).

ENTITY HELD FOR SALE: GIGA

As a result of the worsening economy in Brazil, the decline in sales
seen in 2014 and an uncertain outlook, the Group took the decision to
sell the Giga entity. A Restructuring Agreement, initiated in December
2015, is currently being finalised. It provides for the disposal of securities
held by Somfy SA and the partial waiver of financial receivables. Within
this context, the annual financial statements include a writedown of
€2.0 million recognised in the Group’s net financial income, which
covers the maximum risk.

Pursuant to IFRS 5, balance sheet items are classified as assets and
liabilities held for sale without restatement of the comparative period.
Income statement and cash flow statement items are not restated.

Somfy - Annual financial report 2015

CREATION OF OPENDOORS

By a decision of the Commercial Court of Versailles, Somfy Group’s
successfully tendered for the takeover of the business of Openways
SAS. This company specialises in access control (digital locks and other
security systems).

As part of this takeover, the new entity Opendoors was created with
share capital of €0.5 million and is a fully owned subsidiary of Somfy
SA. In the consolidated financial statements of 31 December 2015, the
transaction resulted in the acquisition of assets and a cash outflow of
€1.4 million.

OTHER CHANGES IN GROUP STRUCTURE

Apart from the transactions discussed above, the Group made no
major acquisition during the 2015 financial year.

TAX AUDITS

Somfy SAS was subject in 2012 to a tax audit in relation to the 2009 and
2010 financial years. The main adjustment related to the transfer price
policy implemented between Somfy SAS and other Group entities.
The inspection was completed in 2014 when agreement was reached
with the Tax Authorities, and the financial impact has been recorded.
As anticipated, a tax audit covering the 2013 financial year alone took
place in the first half of 2015. The adjustment issued and paid, namely
€1.9 million, is in line with the provision recognised at the end of 2014.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Somfy Mexico, the Group’s Mexican subsidiary, was subject to a tax
audit in 2013 by the tax authorities in relation to foreign trade matters.
The value of the proposed adjustment was €1.4 million, covering customs
duties, VAT and penalties related to lack of product certification. The

company brought an action against the Tax Authorities in relation to
the Customs Code that should be used for importing Somfy products to
Mexico. At the end of 2014, the Group considered that the arguments
put forward by the Tax Authorities were disputable and remained
confident in the likelihood that this ruling would be overturned.
Therefore, the Group had qualified this risk as a contingent liability and
no provision was recognised at 31 December 2014.

By a decision made public in early July 2015, the Fiscal Court declared
the adjustment to be invalid. The Tax Authorities appealed this decision.
On 10 February 2016, the Fiscal Court issued a final judgment in the
Group’s favour. As a result, this risk is no longer qualified as a contingent
liability.

The dispute between Somfy SA and Spirel employees is ongoing before
the Albertville District Court. The employees seek annulment of the
transfer of the Spirel securities, which took place in 2010, and to have
Somfy SA ordered to pay them damages for the alleged deliberate
bankruptcy of Spirel and non-material damage caused as a result of
the anxiety, disappointment and vexation they claimed to have been
victim of, for a total of approximately €9.7 million. Submissions filed
by Chappel Industries France and Spirel were tabled and hearings
should take place during the first half of 2016. Somfy SA disputes the
arguments put forward by counsel for the Spirel employees, believes it
has complied with its obligations and remains confident of its chances
of receiving a favourable ruling.

In addition, in the course of July the employees also brought Spirel,
Chappel Industries France et Somfy SA before the Albertville Labour
Court, disputing the grounds for their dismissal and claiming damages
of a substantially similar amount. Submissions are currently being filed
and, at this stage, Somfy SA is unaware of the grounds on which the
employees are basing their appeals.

Therefore, the Group continues to qualify these risks as contingent
liabilities and no provision was recognised in relation to these disputes
at 31 December 2015.

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PARENT COMPANY DATA

For the year ended 31 December 2015, Somfy SA generated sales of
€3.4 million. Net financial income amounted to €287.8 million, taking
into account €147.1 million in dividends paid by the subsidiaries on
their profits for the year ended 31 December 2014 and including
€149.1 million in revenue distributed on Faac’s exit.

Net extraordinary expense totalled €0.4 million.

Net profit was €279.5 million, after inclusion of an income tax gain of
€3.4 million.

CONSOLIDATED DATA
SALES

Sales totalled €1,061.1 million for the financial year just ended, an
increase of 8.1% in real terms and 5.6% on a like-for-like basis compared
with the previous year.

All geographic regions achieved growth, with several of them recording
a marked acceleration in the second half, partly due to the base effect.
Central and Eastern Europe, Southern Europe and Northern Europe
again stood out, benefiting from expansion in Poland, the Czech
Republic, the Middle East and Africa, as well as from the continued
recovery of the Iberian Peninsula, the UK and the Netherlands.

The Americas and Asia-Pacific suffered from the downturn in Brazil and
Korea and from the slowdown in China, but conversely fully benefited
from the dynamism of North America, Mexico, Australia and Japan.
Germany and France recovered as the year progressed and as a result
successfully offset the downturn seen at the beginning of the year.

RESULTS

Current operating result was €165.6 million for the financial year, up
10.6% and representing 15.6% of sales, compared with 15.3% the pre-
vious year.

The increase is attributable to sales growth, foreign exchange gains
and a healthy gross margin. It was achieved against the backdrop of a
significant rise in structure costs, due to the continuation of the invest-
ment plan initiated in previous years and the resulting increase in
research and development expenses.

Net profit was €164.8 million, boosted by the proceeds from the exit
from CIAT and Faac’s share capital (€5.9 million and €33.9 million
respectively) but curtailed by provisions for the writedown of financial
interests in Garen Automagao and Giga (€6.7 million in total).

Net profit restated for exceptional items! was €127.2 million, an
increase of 9.2%.

SEGMENT REPORTING AT 31 DECEMBER 2015

€ thousands

Europe, Middle

FINANCIAL POSITION

The net cash position went from a net financial debt of €199.9 million
to a net cash surplus of €1.2 million between the start and the end of
the financial year.

The improvement is closely linked to the high level of cash flow, a
controlled increase in working capital requirement and the payments
received following the exit from the share capital of both CIAT and Faac.
The net financial debt corresponds to the difference between financial
assets and financial liabilities. Notably it takes into account unlisted
bonds receivable, issued by certain companies in which shares are
held or related entities, earn-out on acquisitions, liabilities relating
to options granted to minority shareholders in fully-consolidated
companies and deferred settlements of a financial nature. Not included
are securities in non-controlling equity investments, convertible bonds,
deposits & guarantees and government grants.

The net financial debt is detailed in note 8.2.3 to the consolidated
financial statements.

9 March 2016;

— Unanimously appointed Jean Guillaume Despature, a member of the

end of 2015 under IFRS 5 included the assumptions of this agreement.

CIAT

On 31 March 2016, United Technologies Corporation filed a claim
against sellers of CIAT shares within the framework of the liability

possible, as of the date of the Combined General Meeting, to calculate
Somfy Group’s potential exposure.

— Jean Guillaume Despature, Chairman of the Management Board,
and
— Pierre Ribeiro, Group CFO.

OUTLOOK

The current financial year should be marked by an unstable environment in the Americas and Asia, particularly in China, due to the local economic
and monetary uncertainties, and by a rebalancing in Europe following the catching-up process seen over the recent period in regions such as
Benelux and the Iberian Peninsula.

The investment effort will nevertheless be maintained, even increased in certain areas, mainly focusing on product innovation and brand promotion,
in order to permit the Group to fully benefit from new market opportunities (expansion of connected objects, development of environmentally
responsible solutions, etc.).

BYLAW PROVISIONS RELATING TO DOUBLE

VOTING RIGHTS (Excerpt of Article 29 of the bylaws)
“The voting right attached to shares is proportional to the capital that

A voting right that is double that conferred on other shares is allocated
to all fully paid shares that have been duly registered for at least four
years in the name of the same shareholder at the end of the calendar
year preceding that of each General Meeting.

In the case of a capital increase by the capitalisation of reserves, profits
or issue premiums, registered shares granted free of charge to a share-
holder in exchange for existing shares, which already benefit from this
right, will be entitled to the same double voting right.

All shares converted into bearer shares or whose ownership has been
transferred shall lose their entitlement to a double voting right, except
in instances provided for by law.”

Somfy - Annual financial report 2015

— To proceed with the possible cancellation of shares acquired, subject
to the authorisation granted by the General Meeting of shareholders
of 14 May 2014 in its sixth resolution, sitting in extraordinary session.

The company reserved the right to use options or derivative instru-
ments, in accordance with applicable regulations.
The maximum purchase price was set at €330 per share, with
the maximum amount of the share buyback programme set at
€126,133,590, taking account of the 401,457 treasury shares held at
31 December 2014.
During the financial year just ended, on the basis of the authorisations
given by the General Meetings of 2014 and 2015, the company bought
back 585,618 shares at an average price of €203.96, sold 14,395 shares
at an average price of €259.04 and cancelled 436,800 shares priced at
€202.50.
The untying of capital relationships between Faac and Somfy is now
effective. It has given rise to the cancellation of all the Faac shares held
by Somfy, with Somfy concurrently receiving, as consideration, all the
Somfy shares held by Faac and the payment by Faac of a balance of
€50.7 million.
It should be noted that, of the shares acquired, the company purchased
571,400 Somfy shares on 27 May 2015 from Faac through a number of
off-market transactions, and concurrently cancelled 436,800 of these
securities to reduce the number of treasury shares held. Following this
transaction, the share capital comprises 7,400,000 shares.
Of the 585,618 shares acquired, 14,218 were allocated for the purpose
of liquidity, 134,600 for the purpose of retention for their subsequent
remittance in exchange or payment in relation to potential mergers
and acquisitions, and 436,800 shares were allocated for the purpose
of cancelling purchased shares, in accordance with the authorisation
granted by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders of 14 May
2014 in its sixth extraordinary resolution and were cancelled as stated
above.
No shares were re-allocated for objectives other than those initially
specified.
The company held 535,880 of its own shares at 31 December 2015,
representing 7.24% of the share capital; the value of the purchase
price of the share amounted to €185.26 for a par value of €1 each,
representing a total nominal value of €535,880 (€389 for the liquidity
contract, €246,854 to be retained for future acquisition transactions
and €288,637 to cover option plans to purchase shares and/or free
share allocation plans).

The Management Board will submit a new share buyback plan for
a period of 18 months for shareholders’ approval. This plan would
replace the current programme, which would be terminated early. It
would allow management to purchase up to 10% of the shares of the

company, if necessary restated for any potential capital increase or
decrease transactions that may be carried out over the timeframe of
the programme. The objectives of this programme would be:
— To stimulate the secondary market or ensure the liquidity of the
Somfy share, by way of an investment services provider within a
liquidity contract that complies with the Ethics Charter of AMAFI
recognised by regulations;
To retain the shares purchased and subsequently exchange them or
use them as payment within the framework of potential acquisitions;
To ensure the coverage of stock option plans and/or free share
allocation plans (or similar) granted to employees and/or corporate
officers of the Group, as well as all other shares allocated under
a company or group savings scheme (or similar), in relation to
employee profit-sharing and/or any other form of allocation to
employees and/or corporate officers of the Group;
To cover marketable securities giving right to the allocation of shares
in the company, in accordance with current regulations;
— To cancel purchased shares, in accordance with the authorisation
granted or to be granted by the Extraordinary General Meeting.
The company would reserve the right to use options or derivative
instruments, in accordance with applicable regulations.
We propose to set the maximum purchase price at €480 per share.
The maximum value of the transaction, taking account of the 535,880
treasury shares held at 31 December 2015, is therefore set at
€97,977,600.

REPLACEMENT OF MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD
(Article 15)

“The Management Board is composed of a minimum of two and a max-
imum of five members who are private persons and may or may not be
shareholders.

In accordance with and for the period provided for by the law, the
Supervisory Board will appoint Management Board members, determine
their number, appoint one of them as Chairman of the Management
Board and determine their remuneration.

No person aged over 70 may be appointed to the Management Board.
Upon reaching this age, members of the Management Board are deemed
to have resigned at the Supervisory Board’s next meeting.

The Supervisory Board is authorised to assign the powers of the
Chairman of the Management Board, as conferred by law, to one or
more members of the Management Board who carry the title of Chief
Executive Officer.

Management Board members can be re-elected.

In case of a vacancy, a replacement shall be appointed for the time
remaining until re-election of the Management Board.

If a Management Board member seat is vacant, the Supervisory Board
must change the number of seats it had previously set or fill the vacancy
within a two-month time frame so that the number of members does
not fall below the minimum required by the bylaws. Otherwise, any
interested party may ask the President of the Commercial Court, act-

appointed may, at any time, be replaced by the Supervisory Board.

Management Board members or the Chief Executive Officer may only be
dismissed by the Annual General Meeting or by the Supervisory Board. If
dismissal is decided without just cause, it may give rise to damages. In the
case where an individual holds an employment contract with the com-
pany, the revocation of his/her functions purely as a Management Board
member or Chief Executive Officer will not terminate this contract.”

bylaws in all its provisions. Nevertheless, it cannot increase share-
holders’ liabilities with the exception of transactions resulting from an
exchange or regrouping of shares properly decided and executed.

It requires a two-thirds majority of votes of present or represented

shareholders, including shareholders who voted by mail”;

— Concerning powers, the Management Board has no delegations
except those described under the sections “Information on delega-
tions relating to share capital increases and other authorisations”

04| Management Board report

Somfy - Annual financial report 2015

The above terms of office are exercised within unlisted Somfy Group
companies.

Remuneration includes a fixed part and a variable part.

Variable remuneration is determined by the Supervisory Board on
the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. The variable
part is based on the achievement of objectives that take account of
quantitative and qualitative criteria. For the part based on quantitative
criteria (referred to as “financial” criteria), the criteria used are profit
growth, measured by the average growth in COR (Current Operating
Result) over two years; the growth in profitability of capital used,
measured by the average level of ROCE (Return On Capital Employed)
over two years; and lastly, business development, measured by sales
growth and by its differential with the sales growth of a range of
benchmarks consisting of nine companies deemed to be comparable.
For the part based on qualitative criteria (referred to as “non-financial”
criteria), the criteria used concern the quality performance within the
company, the monitoring of the Quality Management System (QMS),
and the implementation of the Development Master Plan (DMP). These
non-financial criteria are weighted by a coefficient representing the
Remuneration Committee’s assessment of the personal and managerial
involvement of the Management Board member concerned. For
confidentiality reasons, the expected level of achievement of
quantitative criteria, as well as the qualitative criteria, which are
predetermined by the Supervisory Board, are not publicly disclosed.
The variable remuneration also includes the incentive bonus, profit-
sharing and contributions to the Group savings scheme, as described in
the report of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board.

Benefits in kind consist of the use of a company car.

Details of remuneration paid during the financial year just ended are
included in the summary table (page 24).

The company CMC SARL established a supplementary pension plan in
2006. This plan applies to Directors and III-C position Senior Executives,
as well as Managers benefiting from an employment contract, in
accordance with the categories defined by the French Convention
Collective Nationale des Ingénieurs et Cadres de la Métallurgie
(collective bargaining agreement for engineers and managers in the
metalworking industry).

The plan grants a contingent right to a supplementary pension,
pursuant to the so-called “Article 39”, which is dependent on the length
of service of the beneficiary (a minimum of 15 years). The right to a
supplementary pension is acquired at a rate of 0.75% per year of service
and cannot exceed 15% of the potential beneficiary’s reference salary.
The reference salary is defined as the average of the best three years
after applying CNAV re-evaluation coefficients. Based on estimates
setting at 35% the future rate of replacement provided by the compul-
sory pension plans when the affected population reaches retirement
age, this plan should enable the rate to increase to 35 + 15 = 50% of the
reference salary for beneficiaries whose career within the Group lasted
20 years or more.

Commitments of the plan and corresponding assets have been
outsourced to an insurance company. Future commitments are fully
covered by plan assets under management, which were measured at
fair value.

Member of the Management Board concerned: Jean-Philippe Demaél,
potential beneficiary of this pension plan.

In relation to his employment contract prior to his appointment to
the Management Board, Jean-Philippe Demaél also benefits from a
CMC SARL so-called “Article 83” defined contribution pension plan,
applicable to Senior Executives as well as Managers benefiting from an
employment contract, for whom the portion of contributions payable
by the company represents 6.25% of remuneration, limited to the
tranche B cap applicable to the Senior Executives’ scheme.

For members of the Management Board who had benefited from stock
options until then, the new constraints introduced by the Law of 3
December 2008 have led the Supervisory Board to exclude them from
future allocations of performance-based shares and stock options.
However, the Board deemed it necessary to continue giving perspective
to their contribution and bring their interest as much as possible in
line with those of the shareholders and other managers, as in the
past. Therefore, it was decided to grant them variable remuneration
based on identical performance conditions to those used for allocating
performance-based shares to management. No payments were made
in this respect during the financial year.

Committee and Remuneration Committee meetings.

Somfy - Annual financial report 2015

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

AUDIT COMMITTEE

The Audit Committee comprises three members: Victor Despature,
Committee Chairman, Valérie Pilcer (independent member) and Paule
Cellard (independent member).

The Committee’s mission is to monitor the preparation of the financial
information and the efficiency of internal control and risk management
systems. It is also informed of due diligence carried out by the Statutory
Auditors in their legal assignment to audit the parent company and
consolidated financial statements, ensures the latter’s independence
and is involved in their selection.

The Audit Committee supervises the work of Internal Audit and
approves the annual audit plan. It proposes, directs and ensures the
follow-up of Internal Audit assignments.

Since its creation, it has met at each half-year and year-end balance
sheet date.

During the 2015 financial year, the Audit Committee met on four occa-
sions with all members in attendance.

Under the supervision of the Audit Committee, the Internal Audit
Department reports to the Group CFO, a member of the Management
Board.

The department is made up of an Internal Audit Officer and the
equivalent of 3.5 full time auditors, and carries out audits in all the
Group’s subsidiaries, based on an annual audit plan.

This plan, prepared together with the Management of Somfy Group,
is approved by the Management Board and then validated by the
Audit Committee. The assignments included in the audit plan provide
an independent assessment of the efficiency of the system of internal
control in each entity.

Where appropriate, the principal weaknesses identified in internal
control are reported to Management and recommendations are
issued. Monitoring of the implementation of the recommendations
takes place twice a year, as well as during monitoring assignments on
the ground. Every year, a report is presented to the Management Board
and to the Audit Committee.

In addition, urgent assignments that were not provided for in the
audit plan may be carried out during the year at the request of the
Management Board or the Audit Committee.

Twice a year, the Internal Audit Officer presents a report on the activ-
ities of the Department to the Management Board and to the Audit
Committee.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

The Remuneration Committee currently comprises two members:
Michel Rollier, Committee Chairman (independent member) and Victor
Despature. Its mission is to submit proposals to the Supervisory Board,
in particular in respect of the amount and calculation methods for
corporate officers’ remuneration, including findings on the variable
remuneration for 2014 and proposals to be issued for the 2015 financial
year, and to issue an opinion concerning the amount of attendance fees.
Upon its request, external persons who are not members may attend
Committee meetings.

At least once a year, the Committee calls on a firm specialised in the
subject of senior executive remuneration, which provides advice on the
practices that are generally applied in companies of a comparable size.
During the year just ended, it met three times. The rate of attendance
by the members was 83%.

The members of the Remuneration Committee report verbally to the
Supervisory Board on their work and on the opinions they have issued,
thus helping the Board to prepare and make decisions in terms of
corporate officers’ remuneration.

INDEPENDENCE OF THE MEMBERS
OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD

As provided by the Middlenext framework, the Board has assessed the

independence of its members.

Based on the independence criteria suggested by the Middlenext

framework, the Supervisory Board notes that, to date, an inde-

pendent member of the Board is a member who has no relationship

of any nature whatsoever with Somfy SA or its management, or with

a company consolidated by the Somfy Group, that may affect his/her

freedom of judgement, and who meets the following criteria:

— Is not and has not been an employee or executive corporate officer
of Somfy SA or any other Group company during the last three years;

— Is not a significant customer, supplier or banker of Somfy SA or its
Group, or for which Somfy SA or its Group represents a significant
share of his/her business activity;

— Is nota significant shareholder of Somfy SA;

— Is not closely related to a corporate officer or major shareholder;

— Has not been a statutory auditor of Somfy SA over the past three years.

In light of these criteria, the Supervisory Board considered that Paule

Cellard, Valérie Pilcer, Michel Rollier and Bernard Hours qualified as

independent members.

INFORMATION ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
(ARTICLES L. 232-1 AND L. 233-26 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

2015 was a pivotal year for Research and Development at Somfy, which
pursued its investment effort in connected offers and implemented
structural changes, while launching a significant number of innovative
offers on its traditional markets.

At the R+T 2015 professional trade show in Stuttgart, the Group exhib-
ited its five international brands and all the innovations that were
announced in 2014. It was an opportunity to show all the players in our
historical market how strong our brands and how dynamic our innova-
tions are.

In this way, in 2015 the Exterior Business Group continued its invest-
ments in the BLDC motors platform. This technology was integral to the
success of the “Somfy Smart & Smooth Operator” RS100 motor with
customers at the R+T trade show. It offers new kinematics and new
benefits for users. Well received on the market in France, Germany and
Northern Europe, with certain manufacturers already switching to it for

all their purchases, this motor, fitted with a two-way radio is supported
by an ecosystem that generates productivity upon integration with
manufacturers, and creates value in terms of installer configuration
and maintenance.

Transposing this technology to other application technologies, and
initially in the field of terraces, is underway.

Teams are also working on application technology interfaces aimed at
improving our range of autonomous products.

Lastly, following the successful transfer of the outdoor venetian blind
manufacturing lines to Poland, an R&D unit was opened there in line
with the Group’s desire to promote geographical proximity between
R&D, industrialisation and market.

Somfy - Annual financial report 2015

The Interior Business Group’s R&D invested heavily in the North
American market as part of our partnership with Springs Window
Fashion and has developed a connected range that will be compatible
with the standards of this market in the United States. The silent offers,
initially designed for the US market, that also marked R+T, are currently
being extended to include ranges more specifically designed for the
European and Middle East market. The ultra-quiet “Sonesse” motor
was awarded a prize by the tertiary integrators sector in the United
States in 2015.

In relation to curtain applications, the year saw the adaptation of
the development and manufacturing system that began in 2014
completed, for optimisation purposes and to move R&D closer to the
Asian markets. In 2015, the curtains teams worked on expanding the
range (DC + wirefree), with new offers being launched in early 2016.

In 2015, the Building Control Business Group put into production a
range allowing the management of motorised awnings over IP. This
launch meant equipping more than 60 buildings around the world
throughout the year, and installing 20,000 io and SDN motors.

2015 was also marked by the completion of some iconic projects. They
included “200 Georges Street in Sydney”, which is an example of a
successful international collaboration and saw one of the first installa-
tions of the “web remote”, allowing occupants to control sun protec-
tion at their workstation via their computer.

2015 was a busy year for the Controls Business Group, since all the
ranges were renewed, and R+T confirmed our leadership in terms of
design and the relevance of our ergonomics. There was the launch of
the NINA offer, a range with a touchscreen interface and innovative
design and ergonomics, which was a huge success at the R+T trade
show; as well as the development of a range of remote controls for
Asia with tailored aesthetics and the renewal of the wired range.
Preparatory work was also completed in relation to the connected offer.
In parallel, the Group redeployed its connected home operations. The
home automation division became the “Connected Solution” Activity,
represented at the Executive Committee in the same way as the Access
and Home & Building Activities.

Connected offers are a major challenge for the R&D teams. In Access,
a quarter of Somfy brand Residential Access resources are allocated to
it and two thirds of recruitments are software engineers. Similarly, the
Security Business Group replaced three departing employees with the
recruitment of new expertise in Cloud, Apps and video flow.

At R+T, the Activity presented the three Conexxoon offers which allow
accessible and more consumer based home automation by applying
smart home concepts to a more limited environment such as terraces
and windows and to a more specific usage: creating an ambiance,
warning and preventing. A connected security range is being prepared
for early 2016.

The Cloud platform developed by the Group’s subsidiary Overkiz led
to an agreement being signed in 2015 with Monitorling which allowed
Somfy to test service offers.

In 2015, BFT launched its own connected range with U-Link, an open
offer allowing BFT solutions to connect to a number of protocols, in
particular through the provision of an SDK for integrators. Moreover,
BFT carried out a major restructuring of its R&D, by implementing a
matrix organisation by Business Unit (Residential and Industrial, Tertiary
and Commercial, Pedestrian and Urban). In addition to connectivity,
the other area of focus was the redesign of all offers in keeping with
the new BFT brand platform.

In 2015, the brand SIMU invested in its R&D centre, located in Arc-lés-
Gray, on anew connected offer with control, design and operation points
by Smartphone. This enabled the Group to retain a high performance
multi-brand offer, including in connected offer.

The subsidiary WAY which hosts the R&D for ASA and Mingardi launched
seven new products (motors and control points) and continued its
efforts to tailor its offers to its customers’ needs.

Somfy filed 40 new patent applications. The portfolio is made up of
1,849 patents.

A Director of Innovation was appointed in 2015.

INFORMATION ON EMPLOYEE SHAREHOLDING
(ARTICLE L. 225-102 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

At 31 December 2015, the FCPE Somfy (Somfy Investment Fund Scheme) held 47,741 Somfy SA shares amounting to 0.65% of the company’s share capital.

SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTING
(ARTICLE L. 225-102-1 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

A SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT POLICY IN LINE
WITH SOMFY GROUP’S CORPORATE IDENTITY

AND THE STRATEGIC VISION IT PORTRAYS

During 2015, Somfy Group extensively deployed and shared the
Group’s new corporate identity. Our vision, values and development
model define what we are as a company and as employees. It is this
combination that makes a Group unique.

The Group has an ambitious vision: to inspire a better way, accessible to
all, to live in our living environments. The mission thereby committed
to is to help to make a real improvement to our living environments,
not only in terms of comfort, but also in terms of energy efficiency,
security and independence for the people living in them.

The Group’s four values are: Boldness, Respect, Openness and
Proximity.

Boldness is to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit that has driven
Somfy Group since its creation. Being bold means daring to innovate to
support ambitious objectives. This ambition is found in the Sustainable

Development policies that have been implemented.

Respect is to thrive on the diversity of cultures, personalities and
generations. Our willingness to act as ethical and responsible citizens is
a natural part of this respect for diversity.

Openness is to put an emphasis on being open to others, on partner-
ships and on the curiosity of our teams as a source of creativity and
value creation.

Proximity is to be close to our employees and our customers. We are
committed to building long-term relationships based on trust. This
value is embodied in the dialogue that has been established with all
the stakeholders of the business.

These values and this mission of Somfy Group are embodied in our
development model. The challenges in the field of CSR are therefore
naturally connected with our value creation, as they contribute to the
commitment of Group employees and serve the long-term interests
of the Group and its stakeholders. This helps the gradual yet decisive
implementation of Sustainable Development drivers in the Group’s
strategy and operations.

the achievement of the Group’s mission: Providing better living
environments for all.

GOVERNANCE

The organisation as a whole and the teams within the Group contribute
to the continuous improvement of the Sustainable Development policy.

Since 2008, Somfy has had a Sustainable Development Department. It
reports to the Group’s Industrial Department. Its missions are to guide
the implementation of the Group’s environmental commitments.

The Group Human Resources Department has the task of guiding the
implementation of Somfy’s commitments relating to social matters.
The Communications Department has the task of guiding the imple-
mentation of Somfy’s commitments relating to societal matters. In this
regard, the Group Communications Director is a member of the Somfy
Foundation Governing Board, the main driving force of the Group’s
citizenship policy, and whose main purpose is to support projects that
fight poor housing.

The Strategic Committee for Sustainable Development brings together
the Sustainable Development Director, the Group Human Resources
Director and the Group Communications Director. Its mission is to
ensure the coherent implementation of the three lines of Somfy’
Sustainable Development strategy: Planet, Employees and Society.

The 2015 CSR scope covers, among others, seven of the eight factories

located around the world, representing 77.6% of the Group’s industrial

workforce.

Information was collected for 2014 and 2015, which enabled data and

their variations to be compared on a constant group structure basis

throughout the analysis. As such, 2014 comparison data has been

restated (in comparison with the 2014 published data) to incorporate

the broader data consolidation scope.

The methodologies used for the reporting of certain CSR indicators

may present limitations due to:

— Particularities of local legislation in the various countries in which
the Group is located,

— Lack of availability of information on certain scopes,

— Use of estimates in the absence of assessment tools.

WORKFORCE

The increase in workforce is representative of the Group’s international
development. Over the 2015 financial year, the workforce grew 3.9%,
going from 4,029 to 4,187 employees, mainly due to the sharp increase
in the number of employees at our Polish factory SOPEM (more than
69%) whose operations started on 4 January 2014 and which is a new
entry into the CSR scope.

The male to female staff ratio within the scope remained virtually
stable with a balanced split: 51% men and 49% women.

Across the Group, employee expenses amounted to €313.3 million at
31 December 2015, compared with €286.9 million at 31 December 2014.
Within the 2015 CSR scope, these totalled €231.9 million at 31 December
2015, representing 74% of the Group compared with €211.5 million at
31 December 2014 representing 73.7% of the Group.

A RESPONSIBLE SOCIAL POLICY

The Group’s Social Responsibility policy is to support Somfy Group’s
transformation in its continued international expansion, in creating
new markets and increasing its innovation activity.

In 2015, the Group continued to roll out its road map in the field of
Human Resources according to three key areas: the implementation of
practices aimed at turning the personal commitment of each individual
into collective momentum, the development of skills thanks to internal
support measures, and the strengthening of performance through new
cross-company projects.

Within a complex global economic environment, Somfy Group con-
tinued to demonstrate a winning mentality to ensure its growth. This
ambition was driven by the project Let's! 2015 which guided all the
Group’s corporate measures until the end of the year.

AREA: COMMITMENT

The measures deployed help to provide both direction to the collective
project and consistency to maintain and strengthen commitment
within the teams. Each employee is a key player in this development.
A whole series of social measures are currently in place so that every-
one is involved in the ongoing changes: access to information, to train-
ing, development possibilities etc. They also include a formalisation of
the practices ensuring that everyone receives balanced support and is
listened to more.

The strategic issue of competitiveness calls for every employee to feel
recognised, individually involved and to share a desire for collective success.

Work organisation

In all the companies within the scope, the average working week com-
plies with the applicable local legislation and varies between 35 and 45
hours of work per week. The most common working week is 40 hours,
covering more than 56% of the staff within the scope of the study.
Organisation by shift schedule concerned the following production
sites in 2015: Somfy SAS, SITEM and SOPEM.

Collective working hours can vary depending on production plans and
business opportunities. This flexibility is essential in adapting to market
needs. One of the adjustment parameters at industrial level is night
time working, which takes place on an ad hoc basis in the event of a
production peak.

Social relations

Social dialogue refers to all the relationships and interactions that
exist within the company between management, executive staff,
staff representatives and employees. It is an important component in
regulating the collective organisation of work, and it enables Somfy
Group’s social frame of reference to progress and employees to be
informed about the Group’s position and its areas of development and
transformation. The company wishes to enhance its quality and role.
All the companies in the CSR review scope comply with the local laws
and agreements connected with their activities.

Faced with the complexity in which the Group is developing and in
order to better connect the strategic challenges and the economic
constraints with employees’ aspirations and expectations, the social
dialogue drive has been particularly strengthened with employees in
France. Although not all companies in the CSR review scope have union
representatives, social dialogue is guaranteed or implemented through
regular meetings and/or communication with staff representative
bodies or with employees directly.

Generally, the companies in France, Italy, Germany, Tunisia and Poland
have union representation, as well as LianDa, in China. The others,
which are smaller in terms of workforce and subject to fewer require-
ments in this field, encourage social dialogue via direct meetings with
employees.

Certain companies signed new agreements in 2015 or amendments to
agreements in place, primarily in the fields of social dialogue (France),
salaries and employee benefits (Australia, France, Italy, China, Tunisia),
employee savings (France), working time (France), training (Italy), and
pension schemes (France).

Several countries including France have taken action to improve the
“Quality of Working Life”. These improvements have taken the form,
amongst others, of setting up staff rooms, dedicated rooms for sporting
activities, a company restaurant, a concierge service and a créche.

Health and safety

The development of health and safety is one of the key pillars of
Somfy’s human project characterised by the desire to better live
together within the Group. Somfy’s social responsibility begins with a
guarantee to ensure everyone’s physical safety and discover a quality
of life within their working environment that encourages commitment.
Most of the companies have an occupational health department and
internal safety functions, notably strengthened in France by the sup-
port of company doctors and specialists in ergonomics. Efforts have
been made in many countries to reduce the exposure to risks and to
improve working conditions.

Within Somfy SAS, it was decided that a safety engineer should be
recruited in order to improve safety management with the intention of
making it an area of excellence.

During 2015, a tool to manage occupational risks was selected and will
be gradually rolled out in France in 2016.

Work accidents frequency and severity rate indicators for the CSR scope:
In 2015, many companies strengthened their communication and
awareness raising initiatives in the field of occupational risks. Specific
examples involve initiatives on our industrial sites (pedestrian walk-
ways, evacuation signage, safety induction booklets, skylight renova-
tion, etc.) and more broadly concerning mobile employees in relation
to the issue of travel risks. As such, the overall frequency and severity
rates were significantly improved.

In 2015, the industrial organisation set itself reduction targets for its
frequency rates. This indicator was also used in the Somfy SAS incentive
agreement.

In 2014, the study of frequency and severity rates covered four com-
panies: Somfy GmbH, SITEM, Somfy SAS and Simu SAS. A comparison
on a constant scope basis is shown below so that changes may be
understood.

activity of the companies.

04| Management Board report

Somfy - Annual financial report 2015,

It can be seen that accidents occur less frequently and are less serious
in the distribution subsidiaries than on the production sites and that
in both cases the rates have fallen. Overall, the number of accidents
has dropped by 38% and the number of days’ absence caused by work
related accidents fell by almost 15%.

Work related accidents and occupational diseases are monitored,
and preventive action implemented, by dedicated working groups
or specially appointed employee representative bodies, according to
country (HSWCC in France for example). SITEM has, for example, seen
very good growth in results which may be explained by the implementa-
tion of, amongst other things, SIM (Short Interval Management) which
leads to daily updates with production staff during which the problems
identified are reported; where possible resolution takes place immedi-
ately and problems can be escalated to up to five higher levels.
Initiatives related to psychosocial risk (PSR) problems, and more
generally to quality of working life, launched in France in 2014, have
been maintained and strengthened: expanding and professionalising
the monitoring network, training employees and managers in stress
management, organisation of rest and relaxation measures, and
Sustainable Development initiatives.

Efforts have continued in relation to Musculo-Skeletal Disorders (MSD)
including training in movements and posture, workstation ergonomics,
job rotation in production, and road risk prevention.

Most recognition of occupational diseases is related to these MSDs.
The number of people affected by a recognised occupational disease
has been decreasing since 2013.

Absenteeism:
The rate of absenteeism was 2.76% for the entire reporting scope, a
decline compared with 2014 (2.98%).

Equal treatment

Somfy Group pays particular attention to avoiding any form of discrim-
ination and encouraging as much as possible the equal treatment of
employees and applicants. It is important to highlight the diversity
in both our activities and in the people who are developing and
supporting them.

In terms of professional equality, taking into account developments
in legislation, the French companies have signed agreements or action
plans committing them to setting improvement targets in the field of
professional equality. An initial assessment successfully highlighted
positive developments with progress nevertheless to be made with all
our stakeholders.

As such, our partners who benefit from the payment of the apprentice-
ship tax were asked to sign gender equality charters to encourage them
to move forward with us on the issue.

In 2015, the female workforce within the CSR scope grew more than
6% (1.9% for male staff) leading to a slight improvement in the ratio of
male to female employees to almost achieve balance, with 51% men
and 49% women (in 2014, the ratio was 52%/48%).

2,106 2,147 m 2014

It should be noted that across the Group, this workforce ratio is fairly
consistent (58% men and 42% women).

Analysis of 2015
Group workforce

Analysis of 2015 workforce
within the CSR scope

@ Men @ Women

This variation between the Group and the CSR scope can be explained
by the presence in the 2015 scope of three major production sites with
overwhelmingly female staff (SOPEM, SITEM and LianDa) with an over-
all proportion of 78.2% women.

In the area of disability, the majority of the Group’s companies are
subject to local regulations with which they comply. Some take addi-
tional action, often with the support of specialised institutions, to
improve the working conditions of any employees affected by specific
health problems, their continued employment remaining an ongoing
priority. Several measures, such as adapting workstations or working
hours, adapting premises, or support in terms of recognition, restruc-
turing or reclassification can be seen.

In the area of ethics, as announced in 2014, the rollout of the Ethics
Charter began in September 2015. The aim is that, once the rollout
is complete, all Somfy Group employees know about the existence of
this Charter and its contents, and that they have been made aware
of and trained in ethical concepts by their managers. This Charter is a
tool for the promotion of dialogue between employees so that ethics
is an open matter understood by all. More details are provided in the
societal section of this report.

Somfy Group has a network of Human Resources Managers extend-
ing across the entire scope covered by this report. One of their main
roles is to ensure the respect of Human Rights, particularly examining
within their scope rights and concerns relating to racial discrimination,
torture, enforced disappearances, disabled people and the rights of
women, children, migrants, minorities and indigenous peoples.

AREA: EMPLOYABILITY AND SKILLS

The company continued its effort to ensure that the skills of Group
employees are matched with the organisation’s needs and to ensure
the employability of staff.

Employment

In 2015, there were 480 recruitments, higher than the number of
departures (322), which included 26 dismissals. Moreover, the rate of
voluntary turnover”®, exclusively involving resignations, was 3.6%.

It should be noted that the company continued to focus on internal
mobility. As such, in France, more than 46% of positions were filled via
internal mobility.

16. Voluntary turnover calculation method: the ratio between the number of
departures due to resignation over a given period and the number of employees
at the end of the previous period (year).

Although undervalued, the number of training*® hours in 2015 for the
entire CSR scope increased by 13.2% overall in comparison with the
previous year. Employees & technicians and executives & managers
were the main beneficiaries of this increase.

The main training areas used in 2015 generally involved management &
communication, intercultural skills (languages), project management,
quality, development of professional expertise, as well as special efforts

17. Published training hours refer to sessions lasting more than two hours.

18. Given that several of the companies newly included in the CSR scope did
not have details of training hours by category of employee, their total number
of hours was added by default to the employees & technicians category — with
a low overall impact as their staff members represent less than 3% of the total
workforce within the scope.

made to improve health and safety training, following the example of
Somfy SAS which has devoted more than 18% of its number of training
hours to “Health & Safety” training.

The results of the commitment survey Somfyscope, presented in 2014,
enabled some Group companies to take on training plans which more
specifically meet the requirements of its teams.

The Somfy Academies

The “Management and Leadership” Academy, created in 2013, is
aimed at managers’ managers. This system, which alternates 12 days
of training, mentoring and exchange of best practices, aims to promote
transformation and manage changes. This enables managers to better
manage complexity, to act more consciously and effectively and lastly
to fulfil Somfy’s expectations in relation to the expected managerial
approach.

In 2015, approximately 40 new managers and executives received this
training.

The members of this academy (97 to date) were involved in defining
the Group’s strategic guidelines for the new 2016/2020 cycle. As such,
the Believe! Project is going to closely interweave our economic and
human project over the next five years.

The purpose of the “Quality Academy” is to support the management
line in the transformation of the Quality culture. It enables aware-
ness to be raised in relation to the overall Quality strategic issue and
the central role of the customer. It is aimed at managers and depart-
ment heads (80 people) from different areas: Manufacturing, Design,
Purchasing, Customer Relations and Quality.

During 2015, a third Academy, “Business in Motion”, was created which
primarily involves managers in marketing & communication, product
development and controlling. The purpose of this Academy is to
develop a common language, and offers tools to rationalise and align
decision-making. A pilot involving approximately 15 people was carried
out during the second quarter. The Academy should be up and running
in France and China in 2016 covering about 80 people.

Safeguarding career paths: Horizon tool

The Horizon tool introduced in France to support employees in relation
to analysing and securing their career path concerned 170 employees
over two years, including 46 in 2015.

The purpose of this tool is to enable participants to think about their
own professional project: this system, overseen by HR teams, involves
a series of interviews to establish a summary of previous positions
and skills held and to consider potential development paths by taking
into account the feasibility of the project (in terms of the skills gap to
be bridged, the employee’s motivation to change and above all, the
current labour market, both within Somfy or externally). The analysis
of the professional project could lead to a development in the current
position, an internal mobility that has been prepared and validated,
even in some cases a secure transfer to a position outside Somfy. The
Horizon tool is a key component of the mobility policy in place within
the company.

This ability to guarantee a professional future to every employee is
called “employability”. Within this “win-win” approach, Somfy builds
loyalty amongst its workforce whilst making sure they are offered
relevant opportunities. While the business increases its knowledge
and expertise, employees can develop professionally through positions
which suit them perfectly.

AREA: PERFORMANCE
It is through the gradual rollout of key HR business processes - People

Review, Talent Review, Grading, Annual Performance Appraisal and
Salary Reviews — supported by dedicated tools, that Somfy Group

continuously measures both individual and collective performance to
serve its corporate project. The value of the entire system is to guide
and enhance the development of resources to make them a lever of
commitment and attractiveness both internally and externally.

International Human Resources Information System: IHRIS

The Group has set up an International Human Resources Information
System (IHRIS) able to monitor key HR processes in support of
Somfy Group’s business goals. These processes notably concern staff
monitoring, performance management, team reviews, succession
planning, remuneration packages.

This information system will help to build and develop an HR culture
that is shared far beyond the HR community, and to provide manage-
ment with new decision-making aids. It allows everyone to access their
own professional data and that of their teams, and to view their posi-
tion within the structure of the Group.

During 2015, the rollout of IHRIS continued and at the end of the year
covered 3,145 people across 38 countries. The companies added to
the tool this year were: SITEM, Somfy Espafia SA (Spain & Portugal),
Automatismos Pujol SL, Pujol Redutores de Velocidade LDA, Somfy
Bulgaria AD, WAY SRL and Somfy Thailand.

The Group’s goal is for IHRIS to be fully deployed by 2017, for basic
data. Additional modules will be gradually added and will form the
basis of an international deployment plan over the next few years so
that the information system increasingly adds value for Group manage-
ment and employees.

Overhaul of the Performance Review

One of the tools implemented in IHRIS was, for example, piloted during
the first quarter of 2015, between March and April, with a group of
250 managers: Annual Performance Management (APM). The aim of
this development is to bring individual annual appraisals into line with
collective and cross-company targets. This new appraisal, called APM,
enhances not only the performance of the individual, but also team
and company performance. That is why all employees will gradually
have overlapping targets that are clearly defined during individual
appraisals, between departments and between business areas and
projects; all intended to promote collaboration and a stronger link
between performance and bonus.

The impact of this system will ensure quality and uniformity in the

rollout of the appraisal system and process which:

— Expressly informs employees of the requirements and priorities
related to their position (permanent tasks);

— Defines performance targets for the Group, by company, individual
and of management;

— Explains the level of expectation in terms of skills and behaviours via
a clear and shared frame of reference;

— Establishes a clear link between performance and remuneration:
individual increase measured against performance of permanent
role and bonus measured against annual targets;

— Interacts with other HR processes (remuneration, training, career
management);

— Trains managers in a SMART (Specific, Measurable, Ambitious,
Realistic, and Timed) definition of targets and in how to conduct the
various interviews;

— Offers support to managers in the assessment of employees in
the event of a particular concern (poor performance, behavioural
problem, etc.).

The Group’s aim is to strengthen the culture of individual and collective

performance whilst adhering to its values.

Remuneration: Project to categorise management positions (Grading)

Extensive streamlining work has been carried out in the company since
2014 to identify the various positions in all the subsidiaries. The aim
of this Grading (or classification) project is to assess the burden of
responsibility of each position within Somfy, by accurately describing
each role and the skills it requires. This work, carried out gradually,
is necessary to improve fairness, particularly in relation to supporting
and assessing different employees. This was supplemented by a more
transparent vision in relation to the remuneration and employee bene-
fits to which everyone may be entitled.

The Grading project in 2015 involved:

— Assessing 138 benchmark positions for L-1 and L-2 of the Executive
Committee for Somfy SAS and L-1 for the Asia-Pacific Business &
Marketing Area;

— Analysing the internal equity of remunerations within Somfy’s
gradings;

— Comparing Somfy’s remuneration levels with market practices;

— Communicating with managers.

The implementation of Grading enables the provision of clear

information on the rules for employees’ eligibility for the different

components of the remuneration packages and on the employee
benefits in place, whilst providing managers with a common tool to monitor
their management teams (remuneration and career management).

The ongoing project will involve:

— Pursuing the assessments for the L-3 staff of members of the
Executive Committee;

— Constructing a grading based salary structure;

— Defining the rules of governance.

Talent Review

One of Somfy Group’s priorities is to clearly inform all employees
about the management and professional support tools. It also involves
implementing the framework for a genuine “joint construction” of indi-
vidual careers between the employee, their manager and their Human
Resources manager.

Within this framework, meetings between managers and HR Managers,
called People Reviews, are particularly important to ensure the devel-
opment and professional growth of everyone within the Group. It is
at this point that opportunities can be suggested collectively, between
the manager who knows their employee’s skills and the Human
Resources Manager who is aware of the opportunities offered by the
company. The People Reviews mean that both the key positions and
the employees with the drive and necessary skills to develop in a new
role can be identified.

Within this context, the Talent Review process is currently being revised
in order to improve career management. It will include the introduc-
tion of succession planning, the identification of potential and key roles
and lastly, the construction of personalised development plans.

In conclusion, the Human Resources road map remains ambitious,
since the Let’s! 2015 strategic project will be replaced in 2016 by the
new economic and human resources project Believe! 2020. As with
Let’s! in its time, this project will provide direction and set targets.
Believe! involves two components to fulfil two major ambitions: the
first, called Better living for all, is dedicated to the business, and will
enable changes in the world to be anticipated so that we remain
pioneers in our markets. The second, called Better Living Together, is a
managerial and human component combining the values of boldness,
respect, openness and proximity. Together, they combine to support
the Group’s four key transformations: quality, connectivity, innovation
and agility.

ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION

NATURE OF ACTIVITIES, ASSOCIATED RISKS AND MEASURES TAKEN

The activities of the sites are of tertiary, industrial and logistical natures.
Industrial sites mainly perform product assembly operations from
plastic and metallic components and circuit boards sourced from
outside the sites. Assembly operations do not product gas emissions,
liquid releases or substance discharges, with the exception of packing
waste and possible manufacturing scrap which are subject to selective
sorting and recovery.

There are no machine operations generating waste material.

There is no specific noise pollution generated by the industrial sites
affecting local residents. Indeed, operations are situated inside the
buildings and mainly consist of the assembly of small parts.

The different sites are subject to classification levels compliant with
local regulations in relation to pollution or nuisance risks that these
facilities are likely to create.

The French sites are subject to an authorisation scheme for storage
in covered warehouses and a registration scheme for compression
facilities and installation of accumulators for recharging fork-lift trucks.
There are no facilities that correspond to the maximum level,
“Authorisation with encumbrances - (AS)3” commonly known as
“SEVESO”.

Conclusions on the nature of activities, associated risks and measures:
For these reasons, the risk of air, soil, water and noise pollution is low
or non-existent. This report does not therefore provide any information
on these subjects.

In relation to these risks of pollution or nuisance that Somfy Group’s
sites are likely to create and the preventive measures introduced, the
amount of provisions and guarantees for environmental risks is nil.
Given this low level of environmental risk on these sites, there are no
specific resources deployed. The measures introduced are managed by
the facilities departments of the sites.

GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

In 2015, the priority given in previous years to eco-design took shape
through the launch of the Act for Green® label, which designates
products that meet eco-design requirements.

This priority can be traced back to the results of a Bilan Carbone®

(carbon assessment) carried out in 2012. This carbon assessment

had established work on electricity consumption and the use of raw

materials as priorities.

In 2015, three new products were launched on the market with this Act

for Green® label. They included a new motorisation, the S&SO RS100,

and two control points, the Smoove RS100 and SITUO IO.

Act for Green® is based on a framework taken into account by Research

& Development teams. It incorporates requirements that are broken

down according to several subject areas:

— Controlling greenhouse gas emissions through moderate electricity
use and the choice of appropriate raw materials,

— Seeking to use recycled and recyclable raw materials in the composi-
tion of products,

— Materials selected for their low impact on health and the
environment,

— Product durability,

— An available statement of the environmental impacts in line with
the PEP ecopassport® programme. Somfy has signed up to the PEP
ecopassport® programme. This programme, developed by the elec-
tricity industry, defines a standardised method for making environ-
mental declarations in accordance with international regulations
(ISO 14025 & ISO 14040s). The information contained in this PEP
ecopassport® has been independently verified by Bureau Veritas
CODDE.

Somfy - Annual financial report 2015

Specific initiatives regarding internal communication were carried
out, aimed at Research and Development teams in particular, for the
purpose of including these eco-design requirements in all stages of
product creation. A roadmap for the integration of projects in the Act
for Green® programme had been drafted for the next three years.
Requests, both customer and regulatory, in relation to understanding
the substances used in our products has intensified. Work has been
undertaken with the development of procedures and the completion
of analyses to confirm the conformity of Somfy products with the
REACH and ROHS European Directives.

Somfy has a Sustainable Development Department. This department
integrates the resources and skills necessary for the completion of
projects that come under the heading “Planet”. The Sustainable
Development Department rolls out its policy by working with the
teams concerned in Somfy Group’s various sites and businesses.

In 2015, Somfy Group continued to implement measures to reduce the
environmental impact of its sites:

— Somfy participates in the Mobil Arve programme in Haute-Savoie
(France), aimed at reducing the impact of transport pollution in a
zone covered by an air pollution plan;

Car-pooling site in Haute-Savoie (France): 150 Somfy employees
use this private community to easily find a co-driver amongst their
colleagues (up 30 employees compared with 2014);

The measures introduced under the partnership with Corabio made
it possible to achieve the target of serving 10% local and organic
products in Somfy’s company restaurant in Cluses (up 5% compared
with 2014);

The reuse of laptop computers across Somfy SAS: 377 products
handled in 2015 including 143 computers. The update and removal
of computer data is performed by a company promoting the employ-

POLLUTION AND WASTE MANAGEMENT

ment of disabled people. These computers and various accessories
are then reused, thereby breathing new life into them. In 2015, 95%
of the equipment was reusable, with the remaining 5% sent for
recycling;
— LianDa, in China, has developed gardening areas in its green spaces
that are used by its employees;
— The SITEM factory in Tunisia has made investments in LED lighting in
its workshops;
— The SOPEM factory in Poland is committed to reducing its energy
consumption and waste production. Since the factory went into
production in 2014, a structure for sorting and recycling waste has
been introduced. In 2015, meetings with staff have been led to offer
training in procedures to deal with waste;
In Italy, BFT has an ISO 14001 certified structure. Instructions on the
sorting and reduction of waste in manufacturing zones have been
implemented by internal “environment experts” and employees
responsible for waste management. This happens through meetings
and general communication with staff or information campaigns.
Measures have also been implemented in relation to eco-design with
priority accorded to reducing the energy consumption of products,
to packaging and recyclable oils.
Internal communication initiatives continued in 2015 in support of
initiatives undertaken. They took the form of articles in the various
in-house magazines, both in video and paper format (for example, in
the in-house magazine “Imagine” printed in five languages and avail-
able to all Somfy employees), information meetings on site or internal
seminars.
The communication themes tackled were primarily based on the Act
for Green® programme and the link between Somfy’s values and its
commitment to the environment.

Simu SAS continued its thermal insulation improvement measures by

changing the skylights in its manufacturing workshops and replacing

the old office windows with double glazed windows and airtight double

glazing.

Similarly, Somfy SAS continued its initiative to reduce energy consump-

tion on its sites:

— Insulation was improved and LED lighting was installed during refur-
bishment of premises;

— The traditional boiler at the Crétet site in France was replaced with a
condensing boiler, receiving an energy certificate;

— An air compressor was replaced with a variable speed compressor,
receiving an energy certificate;

— Air transfer system to regulate summer and winter temperatures
between two workshops.

Raw materials

Somfy has incorporated requirements aimed at minimising the deple-

tion of raw materials in its Act for Green® framework:

— Use of packaging materials with a minimum of 50% recycled fibres;

— Full use of recycled paper in product instructions;

— Ensuring products can be repaired as much as possible;

— Ensuring durability of remote controls with products resistant to
cumulative shocks.

Regarding the collection and processing of end of life products, in 2013,

Somfy implemented measures for professional sector products, which

represented most of the volume put on the market:

— In France, through a contract signed with RECYLUM, an organisation
authorised to process professional WEEE. This is the result of an
industry approach in which Somfy Group was a stakeholder.

In 2015, Somfy continued in its efforts in this area through working

within the various professional bodies to improve the industry and

work on the recyclability of products. The recycling rate for S&SO

RS100 motors is currently 59% (based on PEP ecopassport® data).

LAND USE

There are no mining operations on any Somfy Group's sites.

Our plants have regular HOSHIN or 5S workshops in order to optimise
the footprint of the sites. A team of specialists, integrated into the
Group’s Industrial Department, is dedicated to leading these projects
at the Group’s plants.

CLIMATE CHANGE

Our industrial activities do not present any risks linked to climate
change, whether they relate to the growing scarcity of water, rising sea
levels or the rise in temperature.

CO, emissions from our activities concern emissions related to the
generation of electricity, gas and mineral fuel. They represent 5,946
tonnes of CO,**.

19. The conversion of KWh to CO, was calculated based on the conversion
factors provided by IAE.

PROTECTION OF BIODIVERSITY

The SOPEM factory in Poland is located on the edge of protected sites
belonging to the Natura 2000 network:

— Puszsza Niepolomicka PLB 120002,

— Torfowisko Wielkie PLH120080.

Somfy SAS owns several sites in the heart of the French Alps, near
Mont Blanc. Somfy wants to act to protect the mountain’s eco-systems
and is involved in local initiatives such as the “Club d’Entreprises pour
la Montagne et son Développement Durable” (CEM2D) (Club of busi-
nesses supporting the mountain and its sustainable development). A
charter was notably developed in 2013.

SOCIETAL INFORMATION

TERRITORIAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACT

Consideration of the local impact of the company’s activity in rela-
tion to employment and regional development

Leader in its business sectors, Somfy Group grew, which in 2015 had a

positive impact on both direct and indirect employment across all the

regions in which it operates. Several elements support this assertion:

— Pick up in recruitment in zones which, following the 2012 economic
crisis, had to overhaul their cost structure: North America, Northern
Europe and Southern Europe;

— In Poland specifically, implementation of a new phase of work to
increase production capacity and creation of a regional logistics
centre. This development of local employment was accompanied by
a transfer of Group knowledge and skills (French operators sent to
train their Polish counterparts);

— In 2015, Somfy Group continued to have a positive impact on
employment in France and particularly in the Rhéne-Alpes region,
where its activities have traditionally been located.

The Group prioritises the local recruitment of senior executives and

employees, as this offers advantages in terms of the understanding of

local issues and cultures which is essential in particular in the residen-
tial sector.

Moreover, the Group wants production sites to be autonomous in

their methods and their supply. The sites have autonomy in their

choice of suppliers from a panel jointly constructed and managed by

Group Purchasing. The aim is to maintain consistency in the purchasing

strategy whilst going as far as possible to ensure local implementation

in relation to sub-contracting and supply. This openness is beneficial
to the Group which in return benefits from successful local initiatives
which can then be rolled out elsewhere.

Group policy aimed at ensuring R&D centres are located close to

production centres and the main consumer-dense areas led in 2015

to the creation of two R&D divisions - in China for curtain motorisation

and in Poland for motorisation of exterior venetian blinds.

Consideration of the impact on neighbouring and local populations

In order to promote regional development, Somfy Group participates
in and supports higher education establishments in the Rhéne-
Alpes region. In 2015, Somfy Group became a founder member of
the Université Savoie Mont Blanc (USMB) Foundation alongside the
Assemblée des Pays de Savoie and the Club des Entreprises de I’Univer-
sité Savoie Mont Blanc. This selection forms part of the longstanding
relationship between the University and Somfy, which has continued
since the creation in 1991 of the Club des Entreprises, of which Somfy’s
Paul Dreyfus was the inaugural chairman. Somfy is working alongside
the University to bring the academic world closer to the business world.
This is the aim of the University-created Foundation. Moreover, since
2012, the Group has chaired the Board of the Ecole Polytech Annecy

Chambéry, the University’s engineering school. In total, 38 graduates of
the University have stated they have worked for Somfy during or after
their studies, 12 of whom hold a Master’s. In 2015, Somfy welcomed
students from the University on work placement and work-study
contracts.

In addition, ARIES group “Graphic and Motion Design” students,
in collaboration with Somfy and Grenoble School of Management,
created a serious game called “Home Smart Home” on the housing of
tomorrow in the form of a board game.

Somfy Group is heavily involved in competitiveness centres and tech-
nology clusters active in the Arve valley (Haute-Savoie), where the
Group’s historical sites are located. Somfy is particularly active in the
Competitiveness Division of Mont-Blanc Industries, where it mixes
with a number of leading and successful mechatronics businesses
such as Altran-NSI, NTN-SNR, Seb-Téfal, Staubli, etc. Somfy is involved
in Thésame, a technology network for mechatronics businesses and
MIND, a Public Interest Group and innovative Franco-Swiss platform
specialised in the mechatronics field. Mechatronics is the synergetic
and systematic combination of mechanics, electronics and real time
computing, and is at the heart of Somfy’s expertise. These collabo-
rations enable the company to be committed to territorial industrial
development whilst continuing to benefit from the input of skills and
innovations into our design and industrialisation processes.

In 2014 in particular, Somfy Group launched the research and
development project COMETE (Cloud pour la maison intelligente
et l'efficacité énergétique / Cloud for the smart home and energy
efficiency), whose purpose is to develop home automation systems
aimed at improving the energy efficiency of buildings. The project
brings together nine partners, businesses and research laboratories
from the Rhéne-Alpes region. COMETE is financially supported by
the FUI (Fonds Unique Interministériel), the Rhéne-Alpes Region, the
Haute-Savoie and Isére departmental councils, and the Communauté
de Communes (federation of local councils) of Grésivaudan. After
three years of this project’s development, Somfy Group believes that
COMETE will lead to the creation of 40 local jobs.

On a different note, the Group has a role of director within the Board of
Governors of the Arve Mont Blanc Intercompany Occupational Health
Service, whose purpose is to promote and encourage the prevention
of occupation risks in the Vallée de l’Arve, action which involves the
health and safety risks for Group employees being better taken into
account.

RELATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS

Conditions for dialogue with stakeholders

The Group annually reviews its communication plan in relation to
its stakeholders, to ensure they are kept regularly informed and to
facilitate as much as possible constructive discussions in relation to
the Group’s strategy and management with the stakeholders iden-
tified as priorities: employees, shareholders, investors, customers,
users, suppliers and regional governments. We distinguish between
customers, a term that refers to the professionals or distributors who
buy and sell, integrate, or install our products; users, a term that refers
to the end users of our products, whether they are the customers of
our customers, users of our solutions in offices or communal facilities,
or consumers buying our products on our websites.

The social section of this report summarises all the developments and
improvements made as part of the dialogue with employees, manage-
ment and unions.

Being responsive to professional customers is a strategic priority for
Somfy Group and it is structured within a programme called “Customer
First”. For each customer profile, Somfy Group has developed dialogue-
based activities — studies, surveys, training, services — tailored to the
expectations of these stakeholders.

Users are regularly consulted as part of the development of our new
offers. A forum moderated by Somfy gives them a voice in France.
Other users, as well as company employees, reply to them. More
than 100,000 questions are consulted each month by those using this
forum, which received almost 800,000 visits in 2015, representing
40,000 unique visitors per month. This allows our hotline to be more
efficient and to answer calls more quickly and has led to productivity
gains in this telephone support service.

Involved in the development of the areas in which the Group is located,
Somfy has led dialogue in France with the various levels of public
decision-making to contribute to action in the areas of education,
employment, research and development, or to support cultural and
sporting projects for local people, by trying where possible to replicate
these events within the company for the benefit of employees. These
programmes include the Mont-Blanc Photo Festival (Pays du Mont-
Blanc), le Salon du Livre Esperluette (Cluses), Musiques en Stock
(Cluses), Plein Feux Festival (Bonneville), MB Race (Pays du Mont-
Blanc) and various sports clubs (Cluses). This collaboration can take
the form of patronage or sponsorship, since the visibility of Somfy’s
initiatives by Group employees or local residents is one of the aims of
this commitment.

In 2014, Somfy created Somfy Ski Talents, a sponsorship programme
for top young skiers, which as well as financially supporting young
athletes, offers to help them, where applicable, to prepare for their
transition into, or in finding out about, the business world. Thus in
2015, Jonas Devouassoux completed a placement at the R&D centre.
Lastly, we help young athletes to build their reputations by passing on
their news via our social networks.

Acitizen’s policy involving employees

Through the Somfy Foundation, the Group is pursuing its civic action in
its field of business where it is strongest: the fight against poor housing,
in keeping with the strategic mission to improve living environments
driven by Somfy.

In 2015, the Group committed almost €400,000 to the Foundation,

which enabled three major programmes to be financed:

— The endowment fund Les Petites Pierres is an online crowdfunding
platform, www.lespetitespierres.org, created in 2013. It enables
anyone to donate to community projects in the area of access to
decent housing. In 2015, the platform enabled 25 projects to be
funded, for an amount of €146,413, topped up by the Group. The
recruitment at the Foundation of a project coordinator for digital
communication meant that support could be put into place to help
associations with their online presence;

— The international programme “A House is a Home” became the sole
vehicle to roll out the Foundation’s measures externally, across all
the countries in which the Group operates and should allow asso-
ciations looking for funding to be directed to the site. In 2015, two
initiatives were conducted — in France, as part of the partnership
with Emmaiis France, a single yet large scale project, the EMRA
(Emmaiis Mutualisation Rhéne-Alpes) community renovation
project in St André le Gaz, Isére; and in Brazil, as part of the “Habitat
for Humanity” partnership, the Foundation renovated one house
per month in a suburb of Sdo Paulo, meaning 12 projects, to provide
housing for single mothers. Several projects aimed at linking the
Group’s subsidiaries with the Foundation are under consideration in
Europe for 2016;

— Continuation of a participation programme for Somfy Group
employees, “Time for Others” (“Un Temps pour les Autres”). This
programme provides associations with the skills and drive of Somfy

Group employees by offering the latter the opportunity to take
part, during working hours, in solidarity action days on behalf of
associations. In 2015, 117 employees benefited from a solidarity
day to take part in this programme. This was an increase of 40%,
demonstrating the interest shown by employees in this programme.
The Foundation led a campaign to raise awareness about poor housing
by debuting a touring photographic exhibition, which shares with
visitors the life trajectories and feelings of those benefiting from
or involved in the projects carried out thanks to Les Petites Pierres
endowment fund. It was exhibited in Annecy in late 2015, as well as to
Group employees.
Following the example of what was achieved in Brazil as part of the
growth strategy in Latin America, and what is currently being imple-
mented in several countries in the Europe, Middle East and Africa
region, the Group is globally exporting the Foundation’s policy in
order to promote this societal commitment to all Group entities and
employees, beginning with subsidiaries where the economic issues
demonstrate that each employee’s commitment is fuelled by a shared
sense of the common good provided by this civic action.

SUB-CONTRACTING AND SUPPLIERS

Suppliers and sub-contracting are important for Somfy Group due

to the nature of its industrial activity which is essentially assembly.

Indeed, all the components that form part of the composition of the

products are purchased components.

In order to make progress in relation to responsible purchasing, Somfy

Group, in collaboration with other manufacturers, has developed a

maturity frame of reference in relation to collective and responsible

purchasing: this framework incorporates the central issues of the

standard, ISO 26000.

This work was carried out within the framework of PEAK, a business

Research and Training network aimed at developing collaborative

customer supplier relationships.

Somfy Group has begun to introduce measures to make sure that its

suppliers and sub-contractors are socially and environmentally respon-

sible. Thus, Somfy has auditors who assess suppliers prior to their

admittance to the panel. These audits are conducted on the basis of a

questionnaire that includes questions on the following topics:

— Existence of an environmental policy,

— Planning to ensure that products conform to environmental
requirements,

— Existence of a health and safety policy and consideration of ergo-
nomic and safety aspects in the design of workstations.

These questions are rated, with the ratings forming part of the final

assessment score of the supplier. If significant variations are discovered,

relating for example to safety in the workplace, Somfy Group may ask

the supplier to take corrective action.

For every component developed by a supplier, Somfy Group requests

a written undertaking relating to the European Directives REACH and

ROHS.

In accordance with the regulations adopted by the US Securities and

Exchange Commission in 2012, Somfy Group implemented its duty

of diligence in respect of its supply chain, in order to ensure that the

supplies used in its products do not contain any “Conflict Minerals”.

FAIR PRACTICES

As announced in 2014, the rollout of the Ethics Charter began during
the Somfy Conference in September 2015. The aim is that, once the
rollout is complete, all Somfy Group employees know about the exist-
ence of this Charter and its contents, and that they have been made
aware of and trained in ethical concepts by their managers.

04| Management Board report

Somfy - Annual financial report 2015

“As it continues to grow, the Somfy Group benefits from greater
visibility in many countries and on increasingly diversified markets.
This development is generating new challenges and imposing new
demands. Protecting the reputation of the Group therefore requires
us to reinforce our need for exemplary behaviour in our day-to-day
activities. Our leadership position on several of our business sectors
and our ambition for the future imply greater responsibilities, which
we readily accept. And the success of our Group will not last unless we
clearly assert our requirements as an ethical and responsible business.
In this context, the Somfy Group has drawn up an Ethics Charter which
will become a point of reference in terms of individual and group
behaviour, and will guide our day-to-day activities. We want to make
this a Charter that brings people together, and share our aspirations
with the men and women who join our Group.”

Source: Introduction of the Ethics Charter by the Management Board
This Charter divides our principles into five areas:

— Compliance with laws and regulations,
‘ e
-thics
ead

Upright behaviour,

Respect for people,

Integrity towards our customers and
our business and financial partners,
Responsibility towards society and the environment.

It is a common and unifying document based on a single set of prin-

ciples applicable to all Somfy Group employees in each of its consti-

tuting entities. This Charter is also a tool for the promotion of dialogue

between employees so that ethics is an open matter understood by all.

To facilitate its circulation, it has been translated into 14 languages, and

30 ethics contacts have been appointed within the Group’s different

companies. Supported by managers, they can be consulted in the

event of an ethical conflict or dilemma. An Ethics Committee has been

set up to lead the process in relation to all the Group’s ethical issues

and to handle any alerts that may be reported via a dedicated and

secure email address. A dedicated e-learning platform and a deploy-

ment kit complement this system; the package is accessible to the

Group’s managers, who are responsible for ensuring its rollout within

their scope.

Somfy Group and its employees particularly seek to respect the regula-

tions of the countries in which it operates in relation to organisation of

work, whilst subscribing to the principles and objectives of the funda-

mental conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO)

and by aiming to adopt the practices of a responsible management

respectful of everyone.

This is reflected in a commitment to:

— Respect differences, improve diversity and reject discrimination;

— Reject any kind of harassment, notably moral and sexual;

— Ensure the health, safety and decent working conditions for the
company’s employees and partners;

— Seek to develop the skills and employability of staff;

— Seek the professional development of employees;

— Guarantee constructive social dialogue.

The Group’s Ethics Charter reaffirms the fact that the company rejects

all illegal child labour and the use of forced labour, seeks to establish

constructive social dialogue and rejects all forms of discrimination and

corruption, whether active or passive.

MEASURES PROMOTING CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

Ensuring the safety of the users of its products is a top priority for Somfy
Group. Alongside other leading companies in the electrical industry
and the building shutters sector, Somfy Group is heavily involved
in standardisation in order to ensure that the good safety practices
implemented in relation to product development are maintained.
This action operates on an international (IEC standards), European
(CENELEC and CEN standards) or local (UL standard for the United
States for example) scale. To show that its products comply with safety
standards, Somfy products are accredited by independent bodies in its
different territories (VDE, NF, SASO, UL, etc.).

Somfy Group acquired a quality management system enabling it to
ensure that its products comply with the standards and requirements
in place within its markets. To control the performance and safety of
the installation of its products, Somfy Group has developed a network
of expert installers throughout the areas in which the Group is located.
These specialists benefit from professional training to help ensure that
the products are installed under optimum safety conditions both for
the installer and users. Every product is accompanied by usage and
safety instructions.

Somfy publishes online manuals on its websites. They are available on
38 of our sites intended for users of our solutions (also on our sites for
professionals) and are translated into between 12 and 18 languages
depending on the product listing. In addition, 32 YouTube channels
around the world broadcast presentations on products and their oper-
ating instructions, usage tips, and even demonstrations on installation
and programming.

METHODOLOGY NOTE
REPORTING PROTOCOL

Somfy Groups’ CSR reporting protocol is the reference guide for all those
involved in CSR reporting within the Group. It is drawn up in French and
English. Its purpose is to define all the Group’s CSR indicators along
with their method of calculation, and to describe the procedures for
their collection and for reporting in order to promote the consistency
and comparability of data. This document is distributed to and applied
at all levels of data preparation and reporting. The reporting protocol is
updated annually to take into account Group developments.

The CSR reporting protocol also serves as a reference framework for
the external verification of data, in accordance with Article L.225-102-1
of the Commercial Code (“Grenelle 2” Law). It is available on request
from Head Office.

SELECTION OF INDICATORS

Somfy Group’s indicators were defined by the CSR officers for each area
in line with the Group’s CSR strategy and the resulting social, environ-
mental and societal objectives. They facilitate the monitoring of the
CSR policy’s progress in each of the improvement areas identified by
the Group and the transparent communication of the Group’s CSR
performance in this report.

The indicators used comply with the Grenelle I] decree and are based
on the general principles of the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative)
guidelines.

38

Somfy - Annual financial report 2015

COLLECTION, INTERNAL CONTROL AND CONSOLIDATION

The collection of CSR indicators is ensured by the CSR officers within
their respective fields of expertise. They rely on their network of local
experts who provide the data.

The CSR officers are also responsible for monitoring the consistency and
plausibility of the data prior to its consolidation in order to generate
the Group indicators included in the CSR section of the management
report.

REPORTING PERIOD

The data collected covers the period from 1 January to 31 December 2015.
Depending on the indicators, it can relate to:

— Anannual consolidation of the data from 01/01/2015 to 31/12/2015,
— The data measured at 31/12/2015.

Where historical information is available, data is reported on the last
two financial years.

REPORTING SCOPE

Companies which are controlled by the Group and fully consolidated
within the financial reporting scope are included within the reporting
scope. The concept of control means the power to govern the financial
and operational policies of an affiliated company so as to benefit from
its operations. Control is generally deemed to exist where the Group
holds more than half of the controlled company’s voting rights.

Newly acquired companies are integrated into the reporting scope
following a probationary period necessary for the introduction of
reporting.

Companies which were sold during the financial year are not included
within the reporting scope.

Specifics of the scope for 2015 reporting:

The social reporting scope taken into account for the 2015 financial
year was restricted to the following entities:

— Somfy SAS (France),

— Simu SAS (France),

— SITEM SARL (Tunisia),

— LianDa (China),

— Somfy China Co Ltd (China),

— Somfy GmbH (Germany),

— Somfy Systems Inc. (USA),

— BFT SpA (Italy),

— Somfy Italia SRL (Italy),

— WAY SRI (Italy),

— Somfy BV (Netherlands),

— Somfy Ltd (UK),

— NV Somfy SA (Belgium),

— Somfy Nordic AB (Sweden),

— Somfy Norway AS (Norway),

— Somfy Middle East Co Ltd (Republic of Cyprus),
— Somfy Egypt (Egypt),

— Somfy Maroc SARL (Morocco),

— Somfy Ev Otomasyon Sistemleri Ticaret Ltd Sti (Turkey),
— Somfy South Africa (PTY) Limited (South Africa),
— Somfy Tunisie (Tunisia),

— SOPEM (Poland),

— Somfy K.K. (Japan),

— Somfy PTY Ltd (Australia),

— Somfy Joo (Korea),

— Automatismos Pujol SL (Spain),

— Somfy Espafia SA (Spain).

Certain companies are excluded from the social scope due to the
existence of very low workforces in certain organisations (distribution
subsidiaries spread out over vast geographic areas such as Russia or
South America), or the lack of Human Resources information systems
designed for collecting data easily. To overcome this last difficulty, an
international information system is currently being deployed within
the Group’s main companies, its aim in the long run being to cover all
Somfy regions and companies.

The environmental reporting scope taken into account for the 2015
financial year was restricted to the following entities:

— Somfy SAS (France),

— Simu SAS (France),

— SITEM SARL (Tunisia),

LianDa (China),

BFT SpA (Italia),

WAY SRL (Italia),

— SOPEM (Poland).

The distribution subsidiaries are excluded from the environmental
scope due to their low environmental impact in comparison with the
industrial sites.

For reasons of organisation and access to information, certain Group
companies have not yet been included. For future years, the Group
wishes to use perimeters that are more relevant depending on
the topics covered and is setting itself the short-term objective of
incorporating all the companies that it fully owns.

It may be recalled that the 2014 reporting scope included the following
companies:

— Somfy SAS (France),

— Simu SAS (France),

— SITEM SARL (Tunisia),

— LianDa (China),

— Somfy China Co Ltd (China),
— Somfy GmbH (Germany),

— Somfy Systems Inc. (USA),
— BFT SpA (Italia),

— Somfy Italia SRL (Italia),

— WAY SRL (Italia).

METHODOLOGY LIMITATIONS

The methodologies used for the reporting of certain CSR indicators
may present limitations due to:

— Particularities of local legislation in the various countries in which
the Group is located,

Lack of availability of information on certain scopes,

— Use of estimates in the absence of assessment tools,

Practicalities of collecting and processing data.

Somfy - Annual financial report 2015

We inform you that the candidates have not, over the past two finan-
cial years, verified any contribution or merger transaction involving
the company or companies it controls within the meaning of Article
L. 233-16 of the Commercial Code.

You will also be asked to renew the authorisations (i) for the purpose
of cancelling the shares bought back by the company under the provi-
sions of Article L. 225-209 of the Commercial Code, which ends on 13
May 2016, and (ii) in relation to the allocation of existing free shares to
employees and/or certain corporate officers, to enable the company to
benefit from the new system under the Macron law, in accordance with
the terms and conditions specified below.

CANCELLATION OF SHARES BOUGHT BACK BY THE
COMPANY PURSUANT TO ARTICLE L. 225-209 OF THE
COMMERCIAL CODE (resolution 11)

You will be asked to vote on the authorisation for a period of 24 months
allowing the company to cancel the acquired shares allocated to the
cancellation purpose as part of the share buyback programme within
the limit of 10% of the share capital per 24-month period.

It is specified that over the course of the last 24 months, the company
cancelled 436,800 shares representing 5.57% of the share capital on
27 May 2015.

FREE ALLOCATION OF EXISTING SHARES TO
MEMBERS OF STAFF AND/OR CORPORATE OFFICERS
(resolution 12)
You will be asked to renew the authorisation in relation to the alloca-
tion of existing free shares, delivered by the Annual General Meeting of
13 May 2015, to enable the company to benefit from the new system
under the Macron law. This authorisation would cancel the authorisa-
tion granted by the Combined General Meeting of 13 May 2015 under
its tenth extraordinary resolution.
You will be asked to grant the Management Board an authorisation
to allocate, in one or more instalments, in accordance with Articles
L. 225-197-1 and L. 225-197-2 of the Commercial Code, existing ordi-
nary shares in the company, for the benefit of:
— Employees of the company or companies directly or indirectly related
to it within the meaning of Article L. 225-197-2 of the Commercial Code,
— And/or corporate officers meeting the conditions set forth by Article
L. 225-197-1 of the Commercial Code.
The total number of free shares thus allocated may not exceed 1.5%
of the share capital at the date of the Meeting, it being specified that
from this limit would be deducted the total number of shares to which
the options that may be awarded by the Management Board under the
authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders
of 13 May 2015 in its ninth extraordinary resolution may give rise.
The allocation of shares to beneficiaries would be definitive at the end
of a vesting period whose duration, which may not be less than one
year, would be set by the Management Board.
Beneficiaries should, where applicable, retain these shares for a
minimum period, set by the Management Board, at least equal to that
required to ensure that the cumulative duration of the vesting, and
where necessary the retention, periods may not be less than two years.
The Management Board shall have the necessary powers to set the other

INFORMATION ON PAYMENT TERMS

conditions and procedures pursuant to which the shares are allocated
and, where applicable, do anything, within the context of applicable
legislation that the implementation of this authorisation requires.

We propose setting the duration of this authorisation at 38 months
from the date of this Meeting.

This new authorisation would terminate in advance the existing author-
isation with the same purpose.

Lastly, you will be asked to vote on dividing the par value of the shares
in the company and delegate the execution thereof to the Management
Board, and on amending Article 2 of the company bylaws.

PAR VALUE SPLIT (resolution 13)

You will be asked to set the par value of the shares in the company at
€0.20 and, consequently, to split each share with a par value of €1, by
exchanging these shares at a transfer rate of five €0.20 shares against
one €1 share, it being specified that this division would take effect ona
date set by the Management Board.

We inform you that the double voting right as provided for by the provi-
sions of Article 29 of the company’s bylaws, would then be allocated
upon the issue of registered shares of €0.20 resulting from the division
of registered shares of €1 bearing this right, the stipulated period of
four years not being interrupted by the exchange.

The €0.20 shares would merely replace the €1 shares which would be
cancelled, and this exchange will not result in a change in the relation-
ship between the company and its shareholders.

You will be asked to approve this delegation and authorise the
Management Board to carry out this exchange on a date following
the dividend payment date, determine the number of existing shares,
amend the bylaws accordingly and more generally, do all that is neces-
sary to implement these decisions no later than the end of the General
Meeting held in 2017 to approve the financial statements for the
previous financial year.

AMENDMENT OF ARTICLE 2 OF THE COMPANY
BYLAWS (resolution 14)

It will be proposed to amend Article 2 “Corporate purpose” of the

bylaws as follows:

“The purpose of the company is, either directly or indirectly, in any

country, on its own behalf or on behalf of third parties, to design,

manufacture and market any solutions and any products which help
to improve living environments, notably in the fields of the automa-
tion of buildings, and to that end it may:

— Acquire, manage or dispose of any equity or investment securities,

— Acquire shareholdings or interests in any commercial, industrial,
financial, personal or real property companies or businesses,

— Manage the available funds that may be at its disposal,

— Acquire, file or use any brands, patents or patent licences, sell or
transfer them, and grant any relevant operating licence,

— Participate in the management of the policy of its subsidiaries
with, where applicable, the provision of specific services to such
subsidiaries, according to their requirements,

and more generally, carry out any commercial, financial, industrial,

or real or personal property transactions that may relate, directly or

indirectly, to the corporate purpose.”

(ARTICLE L. 441-6-1 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

At 31 December 2015 as at 31 December 2014, there were no liabilities due but unpaid to Somfy SA suppliers.
Trade receivables specific to Somfy SA’s activity represent payment terms generally less than 45 days from the end of the month.

Somfy - Annual financial report 2015

INFORMATION ON RISKS (ARTICLE L. 225-100 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

FINANCIAL RISKS

The main financial risks to which the Somfy Group is exposed are
foreign exchange rate, interest rate, liquidity and investment risks.
According to IFRS, all derivative financial instruments are measured at
their fair value. Fair value is either the market value for listed instru-
ments, or a value provided by financial institutions in accordance with
traditional criteria (over-the-counter market). The amounts covered
exclusively relate to current or future transactions within the frame-
work of Somfy Group’s normal business activities.

As part of the transposition of the MIF Directive that came into force on
1 November 2007, Somfy SA and its French subsidiaries opted for the
“individual clients” category.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

Somfy Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily related
to its operational activities (intragroup sales of manufactured products
distributed by commercial subsidiaries outside the Euro zone and
purchases denominated in local currencies).

At comparable terms and conditions, the Group gives priority to
natural hedges (foreign currency purchases related to sales in the
same currency). The derivative financial instruments put into place are
forward foreign exchange contracts for the main currencies and NDF
(Non-Deliverable Forward) contracts.

The management of foreign exchange risk is covered in Note 8.3 to the
consolidated financial statements.

INTEREST RATE RISK

Somfy Group is exposed to risks associated with the effect of fluctu-
ations in interest rates. Management of the interest rate relative to
Group debt is based on consolidated position and market conditions.
The primary objective of the rate risk management policy is to control
Group financing costs.

The management of the interest rate risk is covered in Note 8.3 to the
consolidated financial statements.

LIQUIDITY RISK

Somfy Group must have permanent access to the necessary financial

resources to allow it to finance its day-to-day activities and its invest-

ments. The Group’s liquidity risk primarily arises from the obligation

to repay its existing debt, the funding of its future requirements and

observance of its financial ratios.

The granting of credit facilities is subject to Somfy SA’s commitments

to its banking partners to comply with two types of financial covenants

based on:

— The Group’s financial structure (net financial debt/shareholder’s
equity) and,

— Its ability to repay (net financial debt/cash flow and net financial
debt/EBITDA).

The management of liquidity risk is covered in Note 8.3 to the consolidated

financial statements.

Credit facilities and compliance with covenants are detailed in Note

8.2.2.6 to the consolidated financial statements.

INVESTMENT RISK

The Group’s exposure to investment risk is related to its cash surplus
deposited with banks.

The management of investment risk is covered in Note 8.3 to the
consolidated financial statements.

RAW MATERIAL RISKS

Somfy Group hedges against the volatility in the price of raw mate-
rials that are significantly used in the manufacturing of its products by
placing firm orders with its suppliers, depending on market conditions.

SHARE RISKS

The Group is exposed to equity risk on treasury shares. Given the
share price, it was not necessary to record a provision for writedown
at 31 December 2015.

LEGAL RISKS

Somfy Group’s operations are not subject to specific regulations. Its
business does not require a specific legal or regulatory authorisa-
tion with the exception of the compulsory listing in the Register of
Companies and stock exchange regulations.

Somfy Group is involved in a number of disputes in respect of its busi-
ness. These should not have any significant negative impact on the
Group’s financial position.

To the Group’s knowledge, there were no exceptional events or litiga-

ment, goods, IT equipment) up to the maximum amount of damage
likely to be incurred;

— “Resulting loss of profit”;

Risks insured by these two policies include, fire, explosions, lightning,

smoke, emissions, steam, impacts from airborne objects, electrical

risks, storms, snow, hail, water damage, frost, machine breakage, IT
equipment theft, natural disasters and other non-designated events;

— “General civil liability relating to monetary consequences of an
insured entity’s liability following physical injury, property damage
or moral prejudice caused to a third party during or in relation to its
operations”;

— “Corporate officers’ civil liability”;

— “Transported goods”;

— In addition, credit insurance contracts, both in France and inter-
nationally, mitigate the consequences of customer default.
Approximately 60% of sales are covered by such contracts.

COUNTRY RISK

The majority of operations occur in safe areas such as Europe and the
United States.

The geographic regions most exposed to current economic and mone-
tary uncertainties are Asia (China and Korea), Latin America (Brazil) and
the Middle East (Levant). In total, they represent between 10 and 15%
of Group sales.
