3.7 COMMITMENTS UNDER CO-INVESTMENT PLANS

In accordance with the decisions validated by the Supervisory Board,
co-investment by Eurazeo management and teams is organized
through multi-annual plans, and not on an individual investment
basis. This personal co-investment by management and teams is
nonetheless paid in cash to Eurazeo at the time of each investment.

The first plan covering investments performed during the period
2003-2004 was settled in 2007, as disclosed in the 2007 Registration
Document. Under subsequent plans, Eurazeo teams invested
€15,774 thousand, including €7,110 thousand invested by members
of the Executive Board.

In view of the terms and conditions of co-investment contracts,
the main characteristics of which are described in Note 17 to the
Company financial statements in this Registration Document, it may
be deduced that:

4 rights subscribed under the 2005-2008 plan have no value on the
basis of the valuations used in the NAV as of December 31, 2013;

4 with regards to the rights subscribed under the 2009-2011 plan, as
the investments involved have only been held for a short period of
time and the future crossing of the 6% annual hurdle is currently
uncertain, the final value cannot be estimated at this time.

4.1 ACTIVITY AND HIGHLIGHTS

il EURAZEO ACTIVITY AND HIGHLIGHTS

n 2013, Eurazeo stood out through its active policy in each of
the three stages of its investor business: identify, accelerate and
enhance investment value.

Identify: proof of its ability to detect companies with high growth

potential, Eurazeo completed four acquisitions in two Eurazeo
divisions (Croissance and PME) - IES Synergy, Péters Surgical,
Idéal Résidences and Cap Vert Finance - representing a total
investment of €102.3 million, accompanied by significant build-ups in
existing investments and particularly Elis and Foncia.

Accelerate: Eurazeo continued to roll-out human, financial and
technical resources in 2013 to accelerate the transformation of its

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

Global growth in 2013 was estimated at around 2.7% by the OECD "?
and 2.1% by the UN ®. According to these studies, growth in
countries outside Europe slowed by at least one point, while growth
in China slowed by close to 1.6 points. In Europe, the situation is
more difficult with confirmation of a second year of recession, the
economy contracting between 0.1 points and 0.4 points according
to the two studies. The outlook for 2014 shows an improvement in

RESULTS OF ACTIVITIES

The Eurazeo group reported economic revenue, excluding Danone
dividends © of €6,598.2 million in 2013, stable on last year on a
restated basis (-0.3%) and in line with 2013 GDP trends in Europe.
Restated consolidated revenue © is stable at +0.2%. Consolidated
revenue decreased by 4.1% on a reported basis primarily due to
disposals performed by Eurazeo PME, the sale of Edenred and the
deconsolidation of Fraikin.

The improvement in results is all the more remarkable as it was
achieved by concentrating on the core aspects of the investments.
Transformation is reflected by 38.4% pro forma growth in the
contribution of companies net of financing costs, after restatement for
the extension of the textile depreciation period in Elis. The extension
of the textile depreciation period in Elis had a positive impact of
€9.7 million in 2013 compared with €40.2 million in 2012. Fully-
consolidated investments reported growth of €10.1 million, while the
contribution of equity-accounted investments increased €7.5 million.

global growth of round 3.6%, boosted by a 1 point increase in growth
in the United States and expected growth in emerging countries of
around 5.0%, in line with 2011 and 2012 trends but below growth
levels enjoyed before 2010. China is expected to grow in excess of
7% in 2014.

In addition to these recurring results obtained through the
transformation of its investments, Eurazeo recorded gross
consolidated capital gains of €914.7 million mainly comprising
(i) €416.6 million realized on the sale of Edenred, generating a
cash-on-cash multiple of 2x the initial investment (ii) €221.4 million
realized on the sale of 37% of Eurazeo’s investment in Moncler
on its IPO, generating a gross cash-on-cash multiple of 2.75x
(ii) €44.3 million realized on the sale of three Rexel share blocks
during the year, generating an average multiple of 2.1x the initial
investment, (iv) €85.8 million realized on Eurazeo PME disposals and
(v) €141.9 million realized on the early redemption of the bond issue
exchangeable for Danone shares.

debt

On February 6, 2013, Eurazeo repaid its residual unallocated HSBC.
debt of €110.8 million (including finance costs of €1.2 million).

Early redemption of bonds exchangeable for

in June 2009 Eurazeo issued 15,469,613 bonds exchangeable for
Danone shares for an amount of €700 million, maturing in June 2014.

In April 2013, following the marked increase in the Danone share price,
Eurazeo received conversion requests from bondholders covering
12,334,655 bonds. This increase also enabled Eurazeo to exercise its
early redemption option.

Eurazeo reported consolidated net income attributable to owners of
the Company of €561.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013,
compared with a consolidated net loss of €198.5 million on a reported
basis and €238.4 million pro forma of changes in Group structure for
the year ended December 31, 2012.

This transaction had several positive consequences for Eurazeo:
(i) full elimination of the debt relating to this bond in the amount of
€700 million, (ii) sale of 16,339,143 Danone shares presented to
bondholders realizing a consolidated capital gain net of the change
in the bond derivative of €141.9 million, (iii) reversal in 2013 of the
financial expenses provided on a time-apportioned basis in 2012, for
€24 million; (iv) elimination of the corresponding interest expense for
2013 and 2014 (up to June 10, 2014), of €43.8 million on a full-year
basis; (v) collection by Eurazeo of Danone dividends in 2013 in respect
of fiscal year 2012, in the amount of € 4.8 million.

Following completion of these transactions, Eurazeo held 94,227
Danone shares, representing 0.01% of the share capital and voting
rights of Danone.

A shareholder of Danone for over 25 years, Mr. Michel David-Weill
having been Vice-Chairman of Danone from July 1987 to
February 2011 "), Eurazeo supported the development of this
company and the strategy implemented by Antoine Riboud and then
Franck Riboud over the years. During this period, Danone Group
revenue grew from €5.7 billion to nearly €20 billion.

NEW ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF EURAZEO

Eurazeo, through its new organizational structure based on four
divisions, continued to provide the best possible support to its
investments in 2013.

Eurazeo Capital comprises 10 investors and focuses on investments
with an enterprise value in excess of €150/200 million. Eurazeo PME

and investor business (Hotellnvest). In this context, a new Executive
Committee was formed, representing the two business segments
and five geographical areas and placing operations at the core of the
strategy.

In 2013, the group posted solid results and presented a sound
balance sheet. The second half of the year reflected the significant
turnaround in the hotel business, the set-up of an efficient distribution
policy, and impacts of the savings plan. Group revenue in 2013 totaled
€5,536 million, up 2.7% on a comparable basis (constant scope and
exchange rates) compared with 2012, and down 2% on a reported
basis. The Group's gross operating income amounted to €1,759
million for the year ended December 31, 2013, up 2.6% compared
with December 31, 2012 on a comparable basis, and down 1.7% on
a reported basis.

In 2013, Group recurring cash flow was steady at €248 million. Efficient
management of working capital requirements (+€133 million) and the
impact of the cost cutting plan initiated in the first half of the year had
a positive impact of €190 million on changes in Group net debt, thus
bringing net indebtedness to €231 million as of December 31, 2013.

In line with its distribution policy of 50% of current earnings per
share, Accor will propose for approval at the Shareholders’ Meeting
of April 29, 2014 the payment of a €0.80 dividend per share 100%
payable in cash, or 50% payable in cash and 50% payable in shares
with a 10% discount.

In 2014, Accor will continue to implement the new strategy, by
focusing its efforts on three priorities: 1) redefining its digital strategy,
particularly in terms of distribution; 2) strengthening its brands and
consolidating its market share; 3) rolling out the Hotellnvest strategy.
Starting in 2014, the group will communicate its financial aggregates
in line with its new business model.

APCOA (fully consolidated)

APCOA reported revenue of €678 million in 2013, down 3.3% on a
reported basis and 1.3% at constant exchange rates. This contraction
reflects a performance level affected in the first-half by weather
conditions and the impact of the renegotiation of airport contracts and
by a soft trading environment in the second-half.

EBITDA is €64 million, down 3.5% on last year (2.3% at constant
exchange rates), while net debt rose 2% at constant exchange rates
to €641 million.

APCOA's discussions with its core lenders are in progress in order to
significantly reduce the Company's leverage and this could entirely

dilute Eurazeo’s interest. This has been reflected in the accounts and
APCOA's value is nil in the NAV as of December 31, 2013.

Elis (fully consolidated)

ELIS MAKES FURTHER ACQUISITIONS IN EUROPE AND
ACQUIRES ATMOSFERA IN BRAZIL AFTER RENEGOTIATING ITS
DEBT

Elis completed eight external growth transactions in 2013, representing
an annual revenue equivalent of €46.1 million. These acquisitions were
performed in Germany, (Cleantex in January), Switzerland (Inotex in
January and Kunz in July), France representing an annual revenue
equivalent of €5.8 million (Aquaservice and RLD Sanary in April and
FTHS in July) and Spain (Reig Marti in June and Diana in September).

On December 23, 2013, Elis announced the acquisition of Atmosfera,
the Brazilian leader in industrial laundry services. The transaction
was funded by a combination of debt and equity financing, with
Eurazeo contributing around €45 million in equity. Atmosfera has eight
industrial sites located in the regions of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro,
Belo Horizonte and Salvador de Bahia as well as in the state of Santa
Catarina. It processes 95,000 tons of laundry every year and delivers
to 2,800 clients from the healthcare, industrial and hotel sectors. The
company has 3,500 employees and generated revenue of around
BRL 280 million (i.e. nearly €90 million) in 2013.

This acquisition has greatly accelerated Elis’ international
development: under Eurazeo’s ownership, 20 external growth
transactions have been completed outside France, representing total
annual revenue, including Atmosfera, of €217 million. International
business now represents more than 25% of the company’s revenue,
compared to 13% in 2007 when Elis was acquired by Eurazeo.

On May 28, 2013, the Elis group announced it had obtained the
consent of the required majority of its senior lenders to amend certain
provisions of its existing senior facilities and extend their maturity to
2017, pursuant to its waiver request dated May 21, 2013.

In addition, the Elis group announced on May 31, 2013, that Novalis,
an intermediate holding company of the Elis group, had priced
€450 million of senior secured notes maturing in 2018 at par (the
“Senior Secured Notes”). The Senior Secured Notes will bear interest
at a rate of 6.00% to be paid semi-annually.

The Elis group also issued Senior Secured Notes on June 14, 2013,
and used the net proceeds of the offering, together with the proceeds
of a private placement of €173 million of PIK notes maturing in 2018
and €380 million of senior subordinated notes maturing in 2018,
to repay in full Elis’ existing junior mezzanine notes and the senior
mezzanine notes and to repay a portion of the senior facilities.

On April 15, 2013, the Elis group announced the sale of its subsidiary
Molinel, a specialist in the design, manufacture and distribution of
professional clothing, to the family-owned Belgian group, Alsico.

OVERVIEW OF THE FISCAL YEAR

Activities and results of the main subsidiaries and investments

RECORD PROFITABILITY

Elis reported a solid performance in the fourth quarter of 2013,
in line with the first 9 months of the year: revenue grew 1.2% ona
comparable basis with constant exchange rates to €303.1 million
(+1.2% over the first 9 months). Sales totaled €1,225.4 million in
2013, up 3.4% on a reported basis and comprising 2.0% growth in
France (revenue of €944 million) and 19.3% growth internationally.
Activity in France was driven by the hotel and healthcare sectors. In
the healthcare sector, where textile maintenance services are being
progressively outsourced, the group continues to win new customers.
The restaurant sector was the only one to report a downturn, penalized
by difficulties in this sector. Outside France, revenues grew 19.3% on
a reported basis to €261 million, driven by acquisitions.

EBITDA increased 6.4% in 2013 to €400.8 million, with an increase
in the margin of 90 basis points on 2012 to 32.7%, a record high.
The group continues to implement strict cost control measures and
achieve productivity gains. Margins improved both in France and
internationally.

Adjusted for the impact of the extended textile depreciation period,
group EBIT increased 9.9% to €212.6 million. The increase in the
textile depreciation period had a favorable impact of €9.7 million in
2013 compared with €40.2 million in 2012. The situation should return
to normal in 2014, with a nil impact.

Net debt is €1,995 million in 2013, up nearly €48 million on 2012.
This increase is mainly due to the costs associated with the June
refinancing (€41 million) and acquisitions performed during the year.
Leverage continued to fall, reaching 5x0 EBITDA in 2013 from 5.2x
in 2012.

Europcar (full consolidation)

STRONG RECOVERY IN EARNINGS IN 2013, ATTRIBUTABLE
TO REORGANIZATION MEASURES LAUNCHED 2 YEARS

AGO — FURTHER INCREASE IN CORPORATE EBITDA EXPECTED
IN 2014

The transformation program launched at the beginning of 2012 was
rewarded in 2013 by a marked upturn in Europcar earnings. The
company has implemented several initiatives, the full effects of which
will not be felt until 2014 and 2015.

At €156.5 million in 2013 compared with €119.0 million in 2012 on
a reported basis, Corporate EBITDA is at the top end of the range
(€150-160 million) communicated on the publication of 2013 third
quarter earnings. It is up 32% on a reported basis and 28% pro forma
of the refinancing. The Corporate EBITDA margin rose 210 basis
points to 8.2% in 2013.

These results reflect the in-depth transformation of the group and
confirm it is ahead of the initial objective of a €50 million increase
in Corporate EBITDA by the end of 2014, an objective increased to
€70 million in November 2013. The action plans launched in 2012
and 2013 include several commercial and cost saving initiatives, the
effects of which will be long-lasting, but not felt until 2014.

Europcar reduced its corporate net debt by nearly 8% at the end of
2013 to €525 million, under the combined effect of increased earnings
and the improved management of fleet and non-fleet WCR. Leverage
improved to 3.4x Corporate EBITDA, compared with 4.6x in 2012.

132. EURAZEO 2013 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT

The improvement in Corporate EBITDA is partly due to the good
resistance of revenue in a market that remains difficult. Europcar
successfully preserved both volume and RPD (revenue per day), with
an increase in the latter from the third quarter. Better management
of seasonal factors, an improvement in the fleet utilization rate
and strengthened fixed and variable cost control measures also
contributed to improving performance (2 point increase in the margin).

Europcar revenue remained stable in 2013 at €1,902.7 million, despite
two negative impacts. Firstly, at constant exchange rates, RPD
contracted during the first nine months of the year before finishing
2013 up 0.1%. Secondly, volumes remained stable over the year
despite a reduction in the number of vehicles for rental, primarily in
Italy in a move to improve profitability, At the same time, management
took steps to improve profitability focusing on three areas in 2013: (i) a
6.9% reduction in monthly unit fleet maintenance costs over the year,
(ii) a 1.2 point improvement in the utilization rate to 75.6% from 74.4%
in 2012, (iii) a decrease in overheads and primarily insurance costs.

Foncia (associate)

A HIGH RATE OF EBITDA/CASH FLOW CONVERSION IN 2013 -
A FAVORABLE OUTLOOK FOR 2014

Foncia continued its transformation in 2013, at both an operational
and commercial level.

The steady improvement in processes, the simplification of the
organization and the implementation of digital tools such as
dematerialization have enabled the company to improve the quality
of its services and employee satisfaction. This was reflected by an
improvement in team retention in the network of 180 basis points in
2013.

At a commercial level and in addition to the ambitious action plan, the
brokerage business recruited a significant number of new employees
in 2013 in strategic areas. This enabled 15% growth in brokerage
revenue in the second-half of the year in a market which reported a
5% fall in volume over the year as a whole (source: French FNAIM).

External growth was also dynamic, with 14 acquisitions in 2013,
including primarily Tagerim, the 8" largest Residential Real Estate
Services company in France.

Foncia reported revenue of €595 million in 2013, up 5.3% on a reported
basis and 3.5% excluding the acquisition of Tagerim (consolidated
revenue of €10 million for 3 months and €44.7 million for a full year).
Sales surged 15.1% in the fourth quarter of 2013 to €160.3 million
on a reported basis and 7.9% excluding the acquisition of Tagerim.
Over the year as a whole on a reported basis and excluding the
acquisition of Tagerim, the Residential Real Estate Services business,
encompassing joint property management, lease management and
rental activities, reported an increase of 2.9% (2.4% over the first
9 months of 2013) and the Brokerage business an increase of 1.3%.

Group EBITDA increased 13.6% to €102.5 million and 11.6%
excluding Tagerim. The 2013 EBITDA margin is 17.2%, representing
an improvement of 120 basis points on 2012 and 180 basis points on
the first-half of 2013.

OVERVIEW OF THE FISCAL YEAR

Activities and results of the main subsidiaries and investments

Net debt stood at €432 million at the end of 2013, with a leverage of
3.8x pro forma of the full-year consolidation of Tagerim. The increase
in net debt was due to the extent of external growth transactions
(€111 million) and one-off costs of €13 million primarily relating to these
acquisitions, while the company continued to generate significant
cash; excluding external growth transactions, non-recurring items and
before tax and debt servicing, Foncia generated cash of €84 million
(.e. 82% of EBITDA).

Foncia confirms its objective of annual organic growth in EBITDA of
5-10% for the coming years. Leverage should near 2x (excluding any
external growth transactions) towards the end of 2016.

Moncler (associate)

Following the sale of the Sportswear division, preliminary reported
earnings solely concern the Moncler brand. In 2013, Moncler enjoyed
another year of sustained earnings growth, driven by continued
dynamic sales, on a constant number of stores basis, and the
expansion of its store network, particularly internationally.

Revenue totaled €580.6 million in 2013, up 19% on a reported basis
(25% at constant exchange rates), The store network generated 57%
of consolidated sales, compared with 51% in 2012, up 33% (41% at
constant exchange rates). At constant exchange rates and on a like-
for-like basis, sales increased 14% in 2013. Wholesale sales increased
4% (7% at constant exchange rates), driven by international markets.
Moncler opened 24 new retail monobrand stores (DOS), including 9 in
the fourth quarter of 2013. At the end of December 2013, Moncler had
a network of 107 DOS and 28 wholesale monobrand stores. Moncler
has already secured the opening of 20 new stores for 2014.

EBITDA increased to €191.7 million in 2013 (€161.5 million in 2012),
representing an EBITDA margin stable at 33.0%. The EBITDA/
cash flow conversion rate remains very high, enabling a €51 million
reduction in net debt to €178.2 million at the end of 2013. Leverage fell
to 0.93x EBITDA in 2013 compared with 1.42x in 2012.

RESILIENT PERFORMANCE IN 2013 IN A DIFFICULT
ENVIRONMENT — A 2014 OUTLOOK TIED TO THE RAPID AND
EXTENSIVE TURNAROUND OF THE NON-RESIDENTIAL MARKET
IN EUROPE ANDTHE UNITED STATES

In an environment that remained difficult in 2013, Rexel posted a
resilient performance, based on strict gross margin discipline and
efficient cost-cutting.

In 2013, Rexel’s revenue amounted to €13,012 million, down 3.3% on
a reported basis. On a comparable basis and in terms of a constant
number of days, the full-year decline was 2.7% with a sequential
improvement over the period: -3.7% in the first quarter, -3.3% in the
second quarter, -2.7% in the third quarter and -0.9% in the fourth
quarter. Adjusted EBITA fell by 7.6% to €702 million, reflecting a
limited decrease in the EBITA margin by 26 basis points to 5.4%
compared with 2012.

In 2013, available cash flow before interest and taxes totaled
€600.6 million, resulting in a net debt reduction of slightly more than
€400 million to €2,192 million. Leverage amounted to 2.72x EBITDA,
compared with 2.95x as of December 31, 2012.

Rexel will propose shareholders a stable €0.75 dividend per share
paid in cash or shares, representing a distribution amounting to 64%
of recurring net income, compared with 53% in 2012.

Depending on the speed and extent of the turnaround in the European
and US non-residential market, Rexel has the following objectives for
2014: 1) sales of between around -1%/+2% compared with 2013
sales on a comparable basis and with a constant number of days; 2)
an adjusted EBITA margin of between around -10/+20 basis points
compared with the 2013 margin, in line with the annual operating
efficiency ratio objective, i.e. an increase or decrease of around 10
basis points in the adjusted EBITA margin for a one percent increase
or decrease in sales; 3) a solid net available cash flow, in line with the
target EBITDA transformation rate, i.e. at least 75% before interest
and taxes and around 40% after interest and taxes.

leases (41%), offices (25%), residential housing (21%) and hotels
(9%). The remaining rent was collected from parking lots and other
surface areas.

EBITDA rose by 18% to €21.6 million, primarily due to a 14% rise
in gross rent and the 8% decline in overheads. Cash flow totaled
€14.5 million, ie. €0.82 per share, and increased by 17% compared
with 2012 pro forma cash flow.

of a second photovoltaic power plant. The company now operates
photovoltaic power plants in France and India with a total capacity of
75 MWp. The development of photovoltaic projects in these regions is
continuing, as well as in Porto Rico, Eastern Europe and Latin America.
Fonroche also continues to develop its biogas and geothermal energy

The majority-owned investments reported total EBITDA of
€66.2 million, compared with €62.5 million in 2012 at constant scope,
with an average EBITDA margin of 16.4%. This improvement was due
to the good performance of nearly all group companies.

Excluding the underwater business, revenue increased 12% in 2013,
driven by the land telecommunications and industrial sectors.

|-Pulse continued to develop its commercial activities in the petroleum

Eurazeo Capital completes the acquisition of
Asmodee, the games publisher and distributor

Elis signs a sale and leaseback agreement
covering 17 real estate assets

On January 22, 2014, Eurazeo Capital acquired 83.5% of the share
capital of Asmodee, a publisher and distributor of board games and
playing and trading cards. The aim is to accelerate the transformation
of the company into a global leader in the publishing and distribution
of games, primarily through international external growth transactions.

This transaction was completed based on an enterprise value
of €143 million, ie. 7.9x EBITDA. Eurazeo invested equity of
€98.0 million, while the company’s management, founders and
minority shareholders invested €20 million, for a total injection of
€118 million.

Asmodee is one of the main publishers and distributors of board
games and playing and trading cards in France, and is also present in
seven foreign countries, including the United Kingdom, Benelux and
the United States. The company was founded in 1995 by Marc Nunés
and is considered a pioneer in “modern” games (party and family
games), publishing and distributing several blockbusters such as
Jungle Speed, Dobble, Time's Up, Miss Kipik, Timeline, Ticket to Ride,
The Werewolves and Hotel. Jungle Speed, Dobble and Time’s Up
alone represented nearly 1.2 million units sold in 2012. The group also
distributes Pokemon trading cards in France, the United Kingdom,
Belgium and Spain. Asmodee currently has nearly 180 employees and
reported revenue of €110 million in 2012, up 13% year-on-year and a

lights for industrial and commercial vehicles

On February 5, 2014, Eurazeo PME announced the acquisition of
71% of the share capital of Vignal Systems, a European leader in
signaling lights for industrial and commercial vehicles. Based in
Lyons, Vignal Systems is a French company founded in 1919, with
a solid reputation in its activity sector. It has 230 employees at its
facilities in Vénissieux and Corbas, where it designs, manufactures
and distributes signaling products, primarily for trucks. With more

the company has consolidated its positions through its acknowledged
industrial expertise, constant innovation led by a highly experienced
R&D team and a first-rate managerial culture.

The group has a highly resilient business model and an organizational
structure that allows it to ride out market cycles. The group reported
revenue of nearly €50 million in 2013, an increase of more than 20%
compared with 2012. Over 70% of sales are generated outside
France. Eurazeo PME invested €25 million and could invest further

On March 17, 2014, Eurazeo finalized a partnership with Desigual
to accompany the growth of the brand. Eurazeo will subscribe to a
€285 million share capital increase and receive 10% of the shares in
the group held by its founder, Thomas Meyer. This agreement grants

true partnership forged between the parties.

Created in Spain in 1984, Desigual designs and distributes clothing
and accessories for women, men and children. Its values, strong
creativity and unique positioning give it a true identity. Its multi-
channel sales strategy has enabled the brand to develop rapidly over
the last ten years.

The company is enjoying exceptional growth, with revenues increasing
tenfold since 2007 and compound annual growth of 29% between
2009 and 2013. In 2013, revenues reached €828 million, up 18% on

acquired Vitalitec, European leader in the
market of surgical clamps, and surgical
adhesive specialist Fimed

On March 28, 2014, Eurazeo PME announced the acquisition by
Péters Surgical, the world’s fourth-largest surgical suture specialist,
of Vitalitec, the European leader in haemostatic surgical clamps in
titanium used to ligature blood vessels. At the same time, the group
acquired surgical and haemostatic adhesive manufacturer Fimed, an
innovative company for which Vitalitec is the exclusive distributor.

These transactions will strengthen the positioning of Péters Surgical
as a surgical closure specialist, with a wide range of products: sutures,
clips, clamps, parietal reinforcement and surgical adhesives. Vitalitec
and Fimed were acquired based on a total enterprise value of more
than €40 million. Eurazeo PME reinvested €22 million in Péters Surgical
to support the group in this dual external growth transaction. Ouest
Croissance, Vitalitec shareholder since 2011, also supported the
transaction, investing €2 million.

With these two acquisitions, Péters Surgical, which reported revenue
of €38 million in 2013, stepped up its growth both in France, by
boosting its commercial presence, and abroad, thanks to direct
operations in the United States and Belgium, doubling its network of
distributors outside France. Combined group revenue now exceeds
€60 million.

Vitalitec was set up in 1991 and is based in Domalain (Brittany,
France). It has 81 employees and two distribution subsidiaries in
the United States and Belgium. The company generates 70% of its
revenue through a network of distributors that export to 72 countries.
Vitalitec shares with Péters Surgical a model based on developing
close relationships with its clients - hospital chemists and surgeons.

Partial sale of Rexel shares

On April 3, 2014, Eurazeo announced the sale by Ray Investment
S.a.rl. of 26.9 million Rexel shares, representing approximately
9.5% of the share capital of Rexel, at a price of €18.85 per share,
representing a total amount of approximately €500 million, by way of
an accelerated book building to institutional investors. Eurazeo, along
with its co-investors, has been a shareholder of Ray Investment S.a.r.l.
since March 2005.

Eurazeo’s share of the proceeds of the Rexel share sale is
approximately €105 million. As a result of the sale, Eurazeo’s indirect
interest in Rexel through Ray Investment was reduced from 9.1% to
7.0% of Rexel's share capital.

OVERVIEW OF THE FISCAL YEAR

Net asset value

10.5 METHODOLOGY

Net Asset Value (NAV) is determined based on net equity as presented
in the Eurazeo company financial statements , adjusted to include
investments at their estimated fair value in accordance with the
recommendations set out in the International Private Equity Valuation
Guidelines ® (IPEV).

Pursuant to these recommendations, which propose a multi-criteria
approach, the preferred method for valuing Eurazeo’s unlisted
investments is based on comparable multiples (stock market
capitalization or transactions) applied to earnings figures taken from
the income statement.

This valuation approach requires the exercise of judgment, particularly
in the following areas:

4 in order to ensure the relevance of the approach, samples
of comparables are stable over time and include companies
presenting characteristics as close as possible to our investments,
particularly with respect to their business and market position;
where appropriate, these samples may be adjusted to reflect the
most relevant comparables;

4 the earnings to which multiples are applied to obtain the enterprise
value are primarily operating income, EBIT, gross operating income
or EBITDA. The multiples are applied to data taken from the
historical accounts (preferred method) © or alternatively forecast
accounts for the coming year where these contribute additional,
relevant information;

4 the value of each investment is then obtained by subtracting the
following amounts from the enterprise value, determined after
adjustment, where applicable, for a control premium applied
to equity (i) historical or forecast net debt at nominal value, as
appropriate, (ii) a discount for liquidity, where applicable and (iii) the
amount payable, where applicable, to other investors according to
their rank and investment managers.

When the comparables method cannot be applied, other valuation
methods are adopted, such as the Discounted Cash Flow method.

As of December 31, 2013, the values adopted for Elis, Europcar Groupe,
Gruppo Banca Leonardo, Foncia, Fonroche, |-Pulse and 3SP Group
were subject to detailed review by an independent professional
appraiser, Sorgem Evaluation “’. This review concluded that the values
adopted are reasonable and prepared in accordance with a valuation
methodology in accordance with IPEV recommendations. The recent
investment in IES Synergy is valued at acquisition cost.

Listed investments © (listed investments and other listed assets) are
valued based on the average, over the 20 days preceding the valuation
date, of average daily share prices weighted for trading volumes. As
the liquidity of the shares concerned is satisfactory, neither a discount
nora premium is applied to the share prices adopted. Where the shares
are held through a company that secured debt specifically to finance
the investment, the transparent amount, net of borrowings contracted
by the holding company carrying the shares, is taken into account in
the NAV. In the specific case of Moncler, the average share price as
of December 31, 2013 was determined from December 16, 2013 (the
date of the IPO), i.e. over 8 trading sessions.

Real Estate investments are valued as follows, at the valuation
date: (i) for ANF Immobilier, in a similar way to listed investments,
that is based on the share price (20-day average of weighted daily
average share prices), ii) for investment funds (Colyzeo and Colyzeo
ll), based on the most recent information communicated by fund
managers. Note that ANF Immobilier's 20-day average share price as
of December 31, 2012 was restated for the settlement of the share
buyback performed on December 26, 2012.

Net cash and cash equivalents © and Eurazeo treasury shares are
valued at the valuation date. Treasury shares allocated to share
purchase option plans are valued at the lower of the closing price and
the strike price.

Net Asset Value is reported after adjustment for the taxation of
unrealized capital gains and amounts likely to be due to management
teams. The number of shares is the number of shares comprising
the Eurazeo share capital less any treasury shares earmarked for
cancellation.

(1) Including, by transparency up to operating company level, the assets and labilies of holding companies and intermediary funds controlled by Eurazeo.

(2) These recommendations are recognized by the majority of private equity associations around the world, and particularly AFIC in France, and are applied by numerous
funds. They may be consulted at the following internet address: http://www. privateequityvaluation.com.

(3) Consolidated financial statements of each investment used to prepare the Eurazeo IFRS consolidated financial statements, before impairment of goodwill and amortization
of intangible assets recognized on business combinations. Figures are adjusted, where appropriate, for non-recurring items.

(4) Inaccordance with the terms of its engagement, Sorgem Evaluation based its opinion on a comparison of values adopted by Eurazeo with a range of estimates obtained
using the valuation methods considered most pertinent. The procedures performed by Sorgem Evaluation were based on () information communicated by Eurazeo,
primarily business plans and available forecast data and (i) publicly available information.

(6) Listed investments comprise investments in listed companies in which Eurazeo exercises control or significant influence. This is not the case for other listed securities.
(6) Cash and cash equivalents net of other current assets and operating liabilities of Eurazeo, at their net carrying amount.

(0.1 APTESTATION OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS ON THE NET ASS

VALUE OF EURAZEO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013

This is a free translation into English of a report issued in the French language and is provided solely for the convenience of English-speaking
readers. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in
France.

To the Chairman of the Executive Board,

In our capacity as Statutory Auditors of Eurazeo and pursuant to your request, we have verified the financial information relating to Eurazeo’s Net
Asset Value as of December 31, 2013 (hereafter referred to as “Net Asset Value”) given in the 2013 management report (hereafter referred to as
“Management Report”) and computed in accordance with the International Private Equity Valuation Guidelines.

The Net Asset Value has been prepared under the responsibility of Eurazeo's Executive Board based on the accounting records of Eurazeo and of
the fully consolidated subsidiaries, as well as on available market data as of December 31, 2013. The method of calculation of the Net Asset Value
and the assumptions adopted are described in part 4.5 of the Management Report.

Our role is to comment as to:

whether the accounting information used for the calculation of the Net Asset Value is consistent with the accounting records and;
whether the calculation complies with the methodology described in part 4.5.3 of the Management Report.

We are not however required to call into question the methodology, the assumptions used and the judgments made by Eurazeo’s management to
determine the fair values of its investments in unlisted companies. Nor are we required to comment on the compliance of this methodology with
a set of standards or best practices, or to comment on the values thus determined for each investment within the context of the Net Asset Value.

In our capacity as Statutory Auditors, we have audited the annual and consolidated financial statements of Eurazeo for the year ended
December 31, 2013.

The purpose of our audit, performed in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France, was to express an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and not on specific elements of these financial statements used for the calculation of the
Net Asset Value. Consequently, we did not perform our audit tests and sample testing with this aim and we do not express any opinion on these
elements taken separately.

We performed our work in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France. For the purposes of this report, our work consisted in:
4 familiarizing ourselves with the procedures set up by your Company to produce the information relating to the Net Asset Value;

comparing the methods applied to calculate the Net Asset Value with those described in part 4.5.3 of the Management Report for 2013;

“4. verifying the consistency of the accounting net assets of Eurazeo and its subsidiaries holding the investments used to calculate the Net Asset
Value with the annual financial statements of Eurazeo for the year ended December 31, 2013;

“4. verifying the consistency of the accounting information used to calculate the Net Asset Value with the elements used as a basis for preparing
the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013, notably:

« in situations where the fair value has been determined by applying multiples to aggregates taken from the accounting records or provisional
accounts of investments, verifying the consistency of these aggregates with the accounting records or the provisional accounts of investments,

>

in situations where the fair value has been determined by applying multiples to aggregates taken from the accounting records and adjusted
for non-recurring items, verifying the consistency of these aggregates with the accounting records before these adjustments are taken into
account,

>

in situations where fair value has been determined by applying multiples to aggregates taken from forecast accounts of investments,
reconciling these forecast aggregates with items used by Eurazeo for impairments tests in preparing the consolidated financial statements,

>

in situations where financial debt items have been used to calculate the fair value of unlisted investments, verifying the consistency of the
financial debt items with the accounting records, except when prospective items have been used;

4 verifying the consistency of the share price used to calculate the fair value of listed investments with observable information;
4 verifying the arithmetical accuracy of the calculations after application of rounding rules, if necessary.

Based on our work, we have no matters to report on the consistency of the accounting information used in the calculation of Eurazeo’s Net Asset
Value with the accounting records and on the compliance of their calculation with the methodology described part 4.5.3 of the Management Report
for 2013.

The present attestation has been prepared for your attention in the context described above and must not be used, distributed or referred to for
other purposes.

The work performed in the framework of this attestation is not designed to replace the inquiries and other procedures that third parties with
knowledge of the attestation may need to perform and we express no opinion as to the adequacy of our work for the purposes of such third parties.

OVERVIEW OF THE FISCAL YEAR

Eurazeo consolidated earnings

The contribution of companies net of finance costs, including
fully-consolidated investments and equity-accounted associates,
increased €17.6 million to €183.1 million. After restatement for the
extension of the textile depreciation period in Elis, this growth of
10.6% increases to 38.4%.

Eurazeo group consolidated investments reported total EBIT of
€576.2 million, up €17.6 million on 2012 pro forma EBIT. Group EBIT
also includes the temporary impact of the extension of the textile
depreciation period in Elis: favorable impact of €40.2 million in 2012,
reduced by €30.5 million in 2013. Restated for this item, Group EBIT
increased by €48.1 million, or 9.3%.

Elis reported EBIT of €212.6 million, down €12.2 million year-on-year
due to the impact of the extension of the textile depreciation period.
Restated for this impact, EBIT increased by nearly 10%.

Europcar reported an increase in EBIT in value and rate terms across
all major markets, reflecting its ability to adapt its resources to the
commercial situation in each country. 2013 EBIT is €260.4 million, up
€33.0 million with stable revenue, representing an improvement in the
EBIT margin of more than 2 points to 13.7% of revenue.

The contribution of equity-accounted associates increased 10.2% or
€7.5 million, boosted in particular by the results of Moncler. Rexel,
Accor and Foncia reported stable recurring earnings.

In addition to these recurring results obtained through the
transformation of its investments, Eurazeo also recorded recurring
items in respect of disposals performed in 2013. Disposals generated
cash inflows of €1,127 million and consolidated capital gains of
€914.7 million, a breakdown of which is presented on page 203 of
this document.

The Holding Company business reported a net loss of €6.5 million.
This improvement of €40.9 million year-on-year was primarily due
to the early redemption of the bond issue exchangeable for Danone
shares.

Consolidated net income attributable to owners of the Company is
€561.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared
with a consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2012
of €198.5 million on a reported basis and €238.4 million pro forma of

Consolidated equity, including non-controlling interests and interests
relating to investments in investment funds and 2013 net income,
is €3,857.0 million as of December 31, 2013, or €61.6 per share,
compared with €3,837.9 million, or €61.2 (adjusted) per share, as of
December 31, 2012.

Consolidated net cash

The Eurazeo group has consolidated cash net of bank overdrafts
of €1,197.9 million as of December 31, 2013, representing cash
generation of €548.3 million during the year.

Operating activities generated net cash of €671.1 million in 2013.
Vehicle fleet flows had a positive impact on net cash flows from
operating activities of €56.0 million in 2013.

Adjusted for these flows (working capital requirements and
acquisitions and disposals) cash flows from operating activities
totaled €615.1 million, up 4.9% on 2012. This increase was primarily
due to a significant tax payment in 2012 (€110.3 million compared
with €77.5 million in 2013) and an improvement in the management of
working capital requirements.

Investment and divestment activities generated cash inflows of
€989.4 million in 2013, reflecting a year marked by disposals.

Proceeds from sales of investments include the Ray Investment
distribution following the sale of Rexel shares (€427.7 million), the sale
of Edenred shares (€602.6 million), the Moncler IPO (€391.1 million,
net of costs), the sale of The Flexitallic Group by Eurazeo PME
(€144.5 million) and the sale of Molinel shares by the Elis group.

Purchases of investments primarily reflect the acquisition of IES
Synergy by Eurazeo Croissance and of Idéal Résidence, Péters
Surgical and Cap Vert Finance by Eurazeo PME, the buy-out of
minority interests in Ray France by Eurazeo and the external growth
of the Elis group.

The impact of changes in consolidation scope primarily concerns the
reclassification of the net cash and cash equivalents of the APCOA
group, whose related assets and liabilities were transferred to assets

OVERVIEW OF THE FISCAL YEAR

Eurazeo consolidated earnings

and liabilities classified as held for sale. Net cash and cash equivalents
of €63.2 million were reclassified.

Property, plant and equipment investment efforts continued during
the year, particularly in Elis. Purchases of investment properties
totaled €93.7 million in 2013: ANF Immobilier invested particularly in
new projects and continued the renovation of its real estate assets,
primarily in Marseilles, Lyons and Bordeaux.

Finally, dividends received were primarily paid by the Accor group.

Net cash flows from financing activities reflect the dividend
distribution of €76.2 million and the decrease in net interest paid
(due to savings resulting from the early redemption of the bond issue
exchangeable for Danone shares in May 2013).

The removal of the Danone shares and the redemption of the bonds
are not reflected in cash flows as the early redemption of the bonds
exchangeable for Danone shares was settled in shares (except for
94,227 shares retained).

The refinancing of the Elis debt generated loan repayments of
€979 million and proceeds from new borrowings of €1,003 million.

The sale of Edenred shares led to the repayment of the borrowing tied
to this share line of €275.0 million.

Eurazeo group consolidated net debt is €3,619.1 million as of
December 31, 2013, down €2,402.1 million on December 31, 2012.

A breakdown of Eurazeo group debt, commitments tied to the
consolidated debt and liquidity risks is presented in Note 14 to the
consolidated financial statements.

There were no covenant breaches for which a major counterparty
default was notified or which benefited from a waiver at the year end.

shareholders.

The ex-dividend date will be May 14, 2014 and the dividend will be
paid from June 10, 2014.

Dividends payable on any Eurazeo shares held by the Company on
the payment date will automatically be added to Retained earnings.

16.2 DISTRIBUTION TRENDS

In addition, the Shareholders’ Meeting of May 7, 2014 will offer each
shareholder the option to elect for payment of the totality of the
dividend to which they are entitled in new shares of the Company.

This option must be exercised through the financial intermediaries
authorized to pay the dividend, between May 14, 2014 and
May 27, 2014, inclusive. Dividends will be paid in cash only for all
options not exercised on this date. Shares will be delivered at the
same time as payment of the cash dividend from June 10, 2014.

The issue price of the new shares to be issued in payment of the
dividend will be equal to 90% of the average opening price of the
Company's share on the Euronext Paris regulated market during the
20 trading sessions preceding the day of the decision to pay the
dividend, less the net amount of the dividend and rounded up to the
nearest euro cent.

Shares issued in payment of the dividend will rank for dividends from
January 1, 2014.

If the dividend amount for which the option is exercised does not
represent a whole number of shares on the day the option is exercised,
the number of shares presented to the shareholder will be rounded
down to the nearest whole number and the shareholder will receive
the balancing amount in cash.

The ordinary dividend distribution has increased at an average annual rate of 7.5% since 2004.
