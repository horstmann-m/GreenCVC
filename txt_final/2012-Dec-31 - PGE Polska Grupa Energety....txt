1.3. Main projects implemented in PGE Capital Group in 2012

In March 2012 the composition of the Management Board was supplemented by 2 persons. As from
March 5, 2012 Mr Krzysztof Kilian was appointed the President of the Management Board and

Mrs Bogustawa Matuszewska was appointed the Vice-President of the Management Board.

The new Management Board set a primary goal which consists not only in a final reorganisation of
the Group's formal and legal structure, but mainly in increasing the operational performance of the
entire Group, so that it can be managed efficiently. With this assumption in mind, several key
projects have been launched, which will translate into short, medium and long-term performance of
the entire Capital Group and its ability to create value in the longer perspective. Projects being vital

for the success of the entire PGE Capital Group are described below.

At the same time, taking into consideration alternating market conditions and challenges ahead of
conventional generation, PGE verifies its strategy and thoroughly reviews current investment
projects in view to ensure optimal development path for PGE Group that makes the most of market

opportunities, with account taken to both the financial and organisational capabilities.

To stay ahead of the competition in a market where electricity prices are determined by variable
costs of energy generation and in face of the increasing share of generation from renewable sources
— highly subsidized and frequently characterised by the elimination of variable costs — retaining strict
cost discipline and reducing the share of fixed costs in the total cost of electricity generation will be
key. PGE takes active measures in this respect, in particular in mine - power plant facilities which

generate electricity from their own lignite resources.

Furthermore, PGE takes steps to secure a regulatory coverage of fixed costs of the least efficient
conventional power plants while simultaneously keeping or improving the stability and safety of the
power system. Among these efforts, Polskie Sieci Elektroenergetyczne S.A. (“PSE S.A.”) issued an
updated Traffic Operation and Transmission Grid Manual which should enable much more efficient

use of Elektrownia Dolna Odra — in both economic and power system aspects.

1.3.1. PGE Capital Group Operating Model

The objective underlying the development of the Operating Model for PGE Group assumes
integrated operations of Business Segments and the Corporate Centre. The essential aims of the
implemented project include building stronger links between operating activities and striving to
take advantage of synergy effects to be achieved by centralised functions of management,
decision-making, planning and analysis. The target development of the Operating Model should
facilitate the coordination of management of margin and investment activities at the Capital Group

level.

By the date of this report on the operations of GK PGE Management Board, the Project have been
completed in the stages of developing a vision for functional areas along with modelling target
processes and designing organizational units responsible for their implementation in the new
operating structure. One of the important components of the Project is developing a key competency
model for employees of the Group. A series of workshops were held with the aim to build
management skills necessary to the implementation of organizational changes for both top
management and employees on key specialist positions. Furthermore, a system of management by

objectives compatible with the new organizational model has been updated and designed.

Next stages of the Project’s execution in the nearest months include implementation of the new
Operating Model throughout the Capital Group, developing updated organizational structures of the
PGE Group and updating documentation regarding the transformation process and corporate

documents.

1.3.2. Implementation of SAP system

In June 2012, the PGE Capital Group launched the implementation of a centralised and integrated
information system of ERP class (Enterprise Resource Planning) designed by the SAP company. The
implementation is one of the prime internal projects (ERP Programme) which will enable to enhance
management processes at various levels of the group's organisation and which is strictly linked to the
introduction of the Operating Model in the Group. The primary objectives of the Programme include
in particular the standardisation of processes, and consequently, a better organisational
performance throughout all the group, improvement and acceleration of the decision-making
process, a more efficient use of assets, designing a uniform reporting and analysis environment, and

achieving more transparency in the functioning of the Group's companies.

“DCE

The implementation process in the PGE Capital Group is led by the PGE Systemy S.A. and selected
external subcontractors. Contracts preceding the ERP Programme execution and involving the
selection of technology and subcontractors were signed in the period from December 2011 to June

2012.

The ERP Programme involves the following business processes: financial accounting, fixed assets
accounts, cash management, controlling, storage management, sale, real estate management,
property management, investment management, human capital management, data consolidation

and reporting, business analyses.

The Programme, which will introduce the ERP system, covers the following companies of the PGE
Capital Group: PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A., PGE Gornictwo i Energetyka Konwencjonalna
S.A., PGE Dystrybucja S.A., PGE Obrdt S.A., PGE Energia Odnawialna S.A., PGE Energia Jadrowa S.A.,
PGE Systemy S.A., Exatel S.A.

1.3.3. Shared Services Centre Development Plan

The Shared Services Centre Development Plan in the area of telecommunications and IT (“ICT SSC”)
has been redesigned with regard to concept and way of implementation. This plan provides for
strategic objectives for the PGE Capital Group with respect to consolidation of ICT services by PGE
Systemy S.A. and by ExatelS.A., respectively with regard to IT and telecommunications.
Consolidation in these areas is aimed at achieving tangible business advantages — better
performance of the Capital Group operations, enhanced processes and improved flow and access
to information as well as maximisation of technology, ICT resources and higher quality of provided

services.
The Project’s implementation bases on three major phases:
I. Development of concepts, assumptions and operating standards for ICT SSCs

A phase with the object to prepare PGE Systemy S.A. organisation for tasks related to fulfilling the
role of an ICT SSC for the PGE Capital Group had been worked out, launched and completed during
period from March to the end of December 2012. Key procedures designed to ensure production
continuity and prepare the company to the execution of 2013 goals, were developed and
implemented within the organisation. Strategic actions were undertaken with regard to the

organization of the development management area (project management), maintenance of ICT

services and support for the user (development of a Central Service Desk). In addition, the PGE
Capital Group adopted a new Accounting Model (defining rules with respect to financial settlements
for services rendered by PGE Systemy S.A. to the companies of the PGE Capital Group) together with
official principles regarding the operation of ICT SSCs, i.e. the ICT Policy.

ll. | Taking over of services and responsibility from the companies

In the fourth quarter of 2012, the 2nd phase of ICT SSC development was launched in order for the
ICT services to be taken over by a specially designed processing unit, i.e. PGE Systemy S.A. According
to the plan, IT responsibilities of the companies PGE Dystrybucja S.A., PGE Obrot S.A., PGE GiEK S.A.,
PGE Energia Odnawialna S.A. and PGE S.A. will be taken over by December 31, 2013.

Ill. Transformation and optimization of provided services

The phase of ICT optimization in the PGE Capital Group was primarily designed to achieve benefits of
synergy effects in the ICT area as a result of centrally managed services provided to entities within
PGE Capital Group, mainly through standardisation and consolidation of IT infrastructure, solutions

and resources.

Along with developing ICT CCSs, PGE Systemy S.A. runs numerous other IT projects which are crucial
for the PGE Group. Key IT projects include: SAP system implementation, modernization
(centralisation) of corporate mail, implementations covering IT Service Management, Dom Maklerski
operational system, GIS (Geographic Information System) and redesigning systems supporting the

process of Connecting New Customer.

Activities carried out from March 2012 mainly aim at developing a new organisational unit and
efficient implementation of all necessary processes with simultaneous assurance of continuity of

services and their quality parameters.

1.3.4. Tur6w Complex optimisation

To stay ahead of the competition in a market where electricity prices are determined by variable
costs of energy generation and in face of the increasing share of generation from renewable sources
— highly subsidized and frequently characterised by the elimination of variable costs — retaining strict
cost discipline and reducing the share of fixed costs in the total cost of electricity generation will be
key. PGE S.A. takes active measures in this respect, in particular in mine - power plant facilities which

generate electricity from their own lignite resources. In January 2013, an optimization project was

launched for Kopalnia Wegla Brunatnego Turdw and Elektrownia Turdw. The aim of the project is to
define actions which, after implementation, will increase competitiveness of the Tur6w Complex,
ensure profitability of the facility operations and, what’s important, will create conditions for its

further development and new investments.

In the first half of 2013 similar projects will be also commenced in other branches of PGE GiEK S.A.,

including Betchat6w Complex.

2. Activity of PGE Capital Group
2.1. Factors and events affecting results

2.1.1. Macroeconomic situation

The PGE Group runs its activities mainly in Poland. Therefore it has been and will be dependent on
macroeconomic trends existing in Poland. At the same time, in connection with the growing
integration, the domestic economy is more and more vulnerable to the changes in the economic
situation in European Union as well as in the international markets. Condition of the European
economy, impact of future regulatory decisions and unstable legal environment makes assessments

of development prospects in the European energy sector subject to significant unpredictability

As a rule, there is a positive correlation between the growth of electricity demand and economic
growth. Thus, the macroeconomic situation of Poland has an impact on financial results achieved by
the PGE Group. Falling electricity prices in Poland and in Europe as a consequence of weaker demand
for electricity and considerably higher share of subsidized renewable energy sources in the total
energy output reduced the profitability levels of conventional sources of electricity generation, and
in certain cases even led to their total elimination. This is particularly relevant to gas-fired power

plants and the least efficient coal-fired plants.

Weakening economic conditions resulted in decreased demand for electricity in the National Power
System in the 12 months of 2012, that was by approximately 0.6% lower in comparison to the 12
months of 2011. In addition, lower energy export along with the growing import of energy from
Sweden and Ukraine, contributed to the decrease in energy prices and production in the power

plants.

2.1.2. Tariffs

PGE Group companies earn part of their income based on tariffs approved by the President of the

Energy Regulatory Office:
|. tariffs for the sale of electricity to households (G tariff group);
Il. tariffs of distribution system operators and
Ill. tariffs for heat.
Sales of electricity

In 2012 sales of electricity to recipients from the G tariff group, connected to the distribution
network of PGE Dystrybucja S.A. took place on the basis of electricity tariffs approved by the
President of the Energy Regulatory Office on December 16, 2011, that came into force on January 1,
2012. In 2012 sales of energy to the corporate customers (key and business) and to individuals
(except for G tariff customers connected to the distribution network of PGE Dystrybucja S.A., for
whom PGE Obréot S.A. is a supplier of last resort), took place on the basis of Tariff for customers from
A, B, C and R tariff groups, approved by the resolution of the Management Board of PGE Obrot S.A.
and effective from December 1, 2011, as well as on the basis of individually negotiated offers and

promotional offers.
Distribution of electricity

Methodology of and assumptions for tariffs determination were published in the document “Tariffs
for the DSO for the year 2012”, which were prepared by the President of the Energy Regulatory

Office and provided to distribution system operators.

Tariff of PGE Dystrybucja S.A. for 2012 was approved by the President of the Energy Regulatory
Office on December 16, 2011 in the part concerning the transition fee and on December 19, 2011 in
other part. Tariffs for 2012, according to resolution of the Management Board of PGE Dystrybucja
S.A, dated December 20, 2011, came into force on January 3, 2012 (according to the decision of the

President of the Energy Regulatory Office, the transition fee has been in force since January 1, 2012).

Distribution tariffs for 2012 approved by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office, contributed

to changes in average payments for customers in particular tariff groups in comparison to year 2011:
x A tariff group — increase by 2.69%;

xB tariff group — increase by 2.93%;

x C+R tariff group — increase by 5.32%;

x G tariff group — increase by 5.84%.

An average price of energy distribution services in comparison to last tariffs binding in 2011

increased by approximately 3.87%.

During the reporting period the approved tariffs for distribution services were not subject to any

changes.
Tariff for heat

Pursuant to art. 47 sections 1 and 2 of the Energy Law, energy companies, which hold licences, set
tariffs for heat and propose their duration. Submitted tariff is subject to the approval by the
President of the Energy Regulatory Office, provided that it is consistent with rules and regulations
referred to in art. 44-46 of the Energy Law. Conduction of proceedings concerning heat tariffs

approval lies within the competence of regional Branches of Energy Regulatory Office.

The binding tariffs for electricity, electricity distribution services and heat, which are subject to the
approval by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office, do not cover all costs incurred by the

Group companies. At present, costs recognized by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office as
He CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012
ae

“DCE

justified costs to calculate tariffs for PGE Group companies are lower than costs actually incurred by

these companies.

2.1.3. Electricity prices

In present conditions, the regulated electricity market is based on the operation of power exchanges
and trading platforms. The market includes the Polish Power Exchange (”TGE” — Towarowa Gietda
Energii), the Warsaw Stock Exchange Energy Market (“WSE EM”), GFI Brokers (“GFI”) and Tradition
Financial Services (“TFS”) trading platforms. The leading exchange market is the Polish Power
Exchange (TGE) with a turnover in 2012 reaching approx. 64% of the regulated market sales, while
the WSE EM share amounted to less than 4%. Other trading operations were carried out on
platforms, with the leading position of TFS — approx. 27% of the regulated market, while GFI’s share

slightly exceeded 5%.

Trading conditions on the electricity wholesale market are subject to constant changes. The
introduction of the so-called ”power exchange obligation”, i.e. electricity generators’ obligation to
sell energy on power exchange markets or regulated markets (art. 49a clause 1 and 2 of the Energy
Law) brought about increasing turnovers on TGE, in particular in the futures and forward contracts
segment, which in 2012 made up nearly 90% of the whole market. With a gradual decrease in the
number of generators subject to the mentioned ”power exchange obligation”, a fall in the TGE’s
share in the regulated electricity market should be expected. The process was already noticeable in
2012 when TGE’s share in the futures and forward market dropped to 61% compared to 69% in the

previous year.

As of April 2013, TGE will become the only electricity market for SPOT transactions in Poland, as the

Warsaw Stock Exchange will cease to provide facilities for commodity trading.

The SPOT market on TGE is based on the Day Ahead Market and the Intra Day Market, where
transactions for hourly contracts and block transactions in baseload, peakload and off-peak hours are

concluded.

The futures and forward market is the basic trading place on the regulated energy market. On TGE,
market participants can make futures and forward contracts with deliveries in periods throughout
the year, each quarter, month or week. Furthermore, trading platforms enable deliveries at the

weekend or on any particular day.

A separate type of market is formed by the Balancing Market (”BM”) which fulfils the functions of
a technical market enabling to physically perform sale/purchase contracts made by traders and to
balance in real-time demands for electricity with its output in the National Power System (NPS). The
existence of the balancing market is indispensable for the operation of the energy market; the
participation of centrally dispatched units and other entities dealing with energy balancing is
mandatory. With the exception of the dedicated technical function, the Balancing Market in Poland is
used for the sale or purchase of energy. In 2012, the energy volume provided and received on the

Balancing Market amounted to 3.7 TWh.
Domestic market

Prices noted on the electricity market in 2012 were significantly lower than prices in the year 2011.
Average prices in all quarters of 2012 were clearly lower than in the same quarters of the previous
year. The most visible differences were noted in the 2nd and 4th quarters when price levels from
2012 were lower than in the same periods of 2011 by respectively 38.38 PLN/MWh and
35.13 PLN/MWh.

A decline in prices on the wholesale energy market was caused by several reasons:

x Lower dynamics of the increasing demand for electricity, which according to PSE S.A. data for

2012, resulted in decreased demand by approx. 0.6% in relation to the year 2011.

x Lower exports of energy along with rising imports from Sweden and Ukraine. The foreign

trade balance went down by nearly 14% year-on-year.
KRESS

x Increased capacity from renewable sources of energy. According to PSE S.A. data, the total
installed capacity in wind plants at the end of 2012 amounted to 2,500 MW compared to

1,776 MW in the previous year (generation capacity increased by approx. 724 MW).

——Electricitydemand =— Monthly electricity demand

SPOT market

From the beginning of 2012 the spot energy market saw lower prices with a yearly average
amounting to 173.58 PLN/MWh (IRDN24 Index). In almost every month of 2012 electricity prices
were clearly below the price levels noted in 2011 and 2010. For example, prices quoted in April and
November were lower than prices in 2011 by respectively: 43.68 PLN/MWh, 59.41 PLN/MWh. Only in
February the average monthly price exceeded the price from February 2011 by 19.28 PLN/MWh and
amounted to 209.07 PLN/MWh. Price levels increase was owed to weather conditions in that month,
and in particular to low temperatures which substantially differed from the long-term average and,

consequently, to a higher demand for energy.
1 IE CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012

V

A drop in price levels throughout the year 2012 should be explained by increased generation capacity
available in the NPS and imports of energy from Sweden carried out in the whole period. At the same
time, a diminishing difference in price levels quoted on TGE and the European Energy Exchange
(“EEX”) did not favour exports — which typically have a crucial impact on prices in Poland — in

volumes of 2011.

A significant power reserve in the National Power System was reflected by price levels on the
Balancing Market, which only in extraordinary circumstances clearly exceeded prices on TGE. The
National Power System resources have a significant impact on the electricity supply, and thus on the
price level. With growing generations from renewable sources, the importance of the segment is
rising as, in favourable conditions, it can periodically replace conventional units. It applies mainly to
energy generated by wind plants, where the average hourly output varied from 13.8 MW/h in July to
29.5 MW/h in December.

Lower prices on the Polish market in 2012 were also partly due to the overall conditions of the
electricity and fuel market. It should also be noted that prices on the EEX exchange were lower than
in the previous year as a result of the so-called “nuclear crisis” following a major damage suffered by
the Fukushima plant. Thus, despite the relatively extended availability of cross-border transmission
capacities, convergent prices in Germany and in Poland were not so crucial for the price levels

development on the domestic market.

In 2012, the turnover volume on the Balancing Market rose by 2.5% compared to 2011. Prices on this
market slightly exceeded prices on the main market (178.74 PLN/MWh), and, additionally, were
characterised by higher volatility. This stemmed from the fact that this market is also used for

commercial transactions.
Futures and forward market

The significance of the futures and forward market in Poland has risen with every successive year.
The number of quoted contracts has gone up and individual products have been contracted earlier.
In 2012, volumes of energy contracted on the futures and forward market with delivery in the year
amounted to 159.3 TWh. Along with energy traded on the hourly and daily market, the turnover
volume with deliveries in 2012 made up 180.6 TWh, which exceeded by 23.6 TWh the demand for

electricity oscillating around the level of 157 TWh.

Futures and forward contracts in 2012 accounted for nearly 90% of total sales on the regulated
energy market. Transactions were mainly conducted on the TGE and TFS markets (60.8% and 30.5%

respectively). Turnover on the two other platforms (GFI, WSE EM) jointly represented merely 8.7%.

Price levels on the SPOT market in 2012, showing a downward trend from February, had a decisive
impact on prices on the futures and forward market. Gradually decreasing prices affected all
products traded in that period. Regardless of delivery dates, electricity sales in futures and forward
transactions on the regulated market in 2012 were higher by 19% compared to the previous year and
accounted for approx. 183.6 TWh. The highest share in sales was noticed in transactions involving

baseload and peakload yearly products , which covered 76% of the volume transacted.

Total sales of energy for the year 2013 in the period before the end of 2012 amounted to 137.6 TWh,
of which 131.0 TWh were used in 2012. Sales included mostly transactions involving yearly baseload
products, whose volume in the year preceding delivery was 101.1 TWh (11.5 GW capacity).
Quotations of the product reflected the changing conditions affecting prices levels on the market. In
the whole year, the Cal13 product lost approx. 45 PLN/MWh in value (decrease from 214 PLN/MWh
in January to 169 PLN/MWh at the end of December). The same applied to yearly contracts with
deliveries in 2014 (decrease from 223.75 PLN/MWh to 178.5 PLN/MWh).

International market

Based on past experiences, conditions on electricity markets in neighbouring countries have
a significant impact on the Polish electricity market. Price levels, their mutual links and availability of
substitutes determine the market situation in terms of prices. The demand and supply of energy on
the domestic market are influenced by active cross-border exchanges. As was observed in 2011, price
levels and demand for energy imported from neighbouring countries favours a rise in prices in

Poland, particularly in periods when PSE S.A. offers large capacities for cross-border exchange on

daily auctions (up to 1,756 MW in one hour). Furthermore, energy imports from Sweden and Ukraine

could effectively reduce price levels as the traded volume reached 820 MW.

In 2012, EEX prices did not differ as clearly from TGE prices as in the previous year. Similarly to the
Polish market, price levels on the German market were significantly lower compared to prices in
2011 and showed a downward trend in the first two quarters with the exception of a rise in February.
Falling demand for energy, increased generations from renewable sources and the increasingly
sharper drop in CO2 emission rights led to low price levels. A spectacular decline in price levels,
noticed in the second half of December when even negative price values could be observed, was
caused by: low energy consumption in the Christmas period and a very high generations from wind

plants.

The Scandinavian market was hit by an even greater fall where prices went down from
48.46 EUR/MWh in 2011 to 34.21 EUR/MWh. This was partly due to a very high level in water
reservoirs, which reached 90% in the second half of 2012. As a result, at the turn of July and August
prices fell to 8 EUR/MWh. Ultimately, price levels in Sweden rose to approx. 40 EUR/MWh due to
end-of-year low temperatures. Unusual price fluctuations were noted in February 2012 when prices
rose to even 100 EUR/MWh. This could be explained by harsh weather conditions and the situation

in Oskarshamn 3 nuclear power plant.

Owing to lower prices on neighbouring markets the total volume of energy exported from Poland as
part of 2012 turnover amounted to approx. 5.2 TWh, of which nearly 2.4 TWh could be attributed to
the connection of PSE-O HzT50 (Germany). The remaining exports represented 1.5 TWh — Czech
Republic, 1.2 TWh — Slovakia and only 127.3 GWh — Sweden. As a consequence of lower price levels
in Scandinavia, imports from Sweden nearly doubled compared to 2011 and amounted to 2.7 TWh.
Furthermore, throughout the year 2012 energy was imported from Ukraine through a connection
launched at the end of 2011 (0.8 TWh). This energy as well as imports from Sweden contributed to
the limited use of generation capacities available in Poland. Total imports of energy to Poland

through all cross-border connections in 2012 accounted for 3.5 TWh.

2.1.4. National Allocation Plan for the years 2008-2012 (“NAP II”)

The National Allocation Plan on CO emission (“NAP”) is subject to the notification to the European
Commission, under the EU emission rights trading system. In connection with the fact that the
European Commission reduced the quantity of CO, emission rights for Poland in both settlement
periods in relation to quantities applied by Poland in the NAP, the granted limits constitute a material

limitation for the electro energy sector.

As regards the second settlement period, which covers the years 2008-2012, Poland applied for
emission caps of 284 million tonnes of CO. The European Commission reduced the average free CO,
emission rightss per year for Poland to 208.5 million tonnes. According to the present NAP II, utility
power plants would only be authorized to emit 110.8 million tonnes of CO2, whereas Polish CO

emissions in normal circumstances are estimated at approximately 120 million tonnes per year.

2.1.5. Prices of CO2 emission rights

Two types of emission rights can be found on the market — EUA (European Union Allowances),
allowing for the emission of one tonne of CO:, and — CER (Certified Emission Reduction), the so-called
reduction rights, which entitle to the emission of one tonne of CO, and which are granted to
generators as result of reaching a long-term target with respect to emission reduction. CER-type
rights may be redeemed by business operators only to a limited extent and they are insignificant to
the financial standing of PGE Capital Group. In addition, using these rights in the successive NAP for
the years 2013-2020 has been made impossible.

Electricity prices are significantly affected by prices of CO, emission rights. The number of CO,
allowances granted to Poland within the National Allocation Plan of CO, Allowances is lower than
demanded by the Polish industry sector. Business operators are obliged to purchase the difference
between the demand resulting from CO, emission levels and allowances granted for free under the
framework of the so-called European Emissions Trading Scheme. The purchasing cost of lacking

allowances is therefore a significant factor determining the financial results achieved by PGE.
Prices of CO, emission rights in 2012 were as follows:

Prices on the market of CO, emission rights in 2012 were significantly lower than prices observed in
the year 2011. The value of EUA Dec 2012 contracts listings went down by 56% in the period from
January 2011 to December 2012. A similar drop was observed for listings of EUA Dec 2013 contracts.
Values of CER contracts listings fell dramatically as contracts could not be carried forward to the
following accounting period anymore.

Among significant factors determining the prices of emission rights in 2012 there were:
xX oversupply of emission rights on the market;
x decreased demand from the industry sector for emission rights due to economic slowdown.

Furthermore, measures taken by European institutions with a view to restrict free allowances in the
next NAP for 2013-2020 or their reallocation at the end of the period crucially contributed to the
volatility of emission rights prices in 2012. As at the date of this report, the European Commission’s
intervention on the market of CO, emission rights was still undecided, which largely contributed to

volatility in prices of emissions rights.

In 2012 and 2011, the Group produced respectively 57.05 TWh and 56.52 TWh of electricity, what

means growth of production by 0.53 TWh i.e. by 1%.

The production increased, among others, in lignite-fired power plants (by 1.65 TWh i.e. by 4%), and

in gas-fired CHP plants, hydroelectric plants and in wind power plants. Coal-fired power plants and

coal-fired CHP plants decreased their production. Production in pumped storage power plants

remained at the same level.

The increase in electricity production in lignite-fired power plants is mainly a result of electricity

production in new 858 MW unit in Betchatow Power Plant. The decrease of production in coal-fired

power plants results from lower competitiveness of these power plants and lower demand from the

Transmission System Operator (PSE S.A.) for electricity in Dolna Odra power plant and in Opole

power plant.

The commissioning of the biomass boiler in Elektrownia Szczecin in the fourth quarter of 2011 also

affected the structure of production in PGE Group in 2012. Biomass boiler replaced all coal boilers

exploited in Elektrownia Szczecin up till that time.

2.1.7. Sales of heat
Sales of heat mainly depend on the weather conditions in Poland.

In 2012 the heat sales in PGE Group totaled 21.71 GJ million and were higher by 1.73% as
compared 2011. Higher sales of heat resulted from increased demand for heat due to lower average

outside temperatures during winter time.

2.1.8. Termination of long-term contracts (LTC)

Due to the termination of LTCs in accordance with The Act on coverage of stranded costs resulting at
generators in relation to accelerated termination of long-term contracts (“LTC Act”), the producers
being earlier the parties to such contracts obtained a right to receive compensations for the coverage
of so called stranded costs (capital expenditures resulting from investments in generating assets
made by the generator before May 1, 2004 that a generator is not able to recoup from revenues
obtained from sales of generated electricity, spare capacity and ancillary services in a competitive
environment after early termination of LTC). The LTC Act limits the total amount of funds that may
be paid to all generators to cover stranded costs, discounted as at January 1, 2007, to PLN 11.6

billion.

In the period provided for by the LTC Act, i.e. till December 31, 2007, PGE S.A. signed termination
agreements with generators being parties to the then applicable LTCs. Therefore generators

obtained a right to receive funds to cover their stranded costs.

The impact of LTC compensations on results achieved by the PGE Group is described in Note 45.1 to
the consolidated financial statements.

In the 12-month period ended December 31, 2012 the costs of purchasing primary fuels from
providers outside the Group amounted to PLN 3,167.0 million and were higher by approximately 9%
as compared to the analogical period of the previous year. It is mainly connected with increased use

of biomass and growth of average gas prices by approximately 15%.

In 2012 approximately 71% of the electricity produced was obtained from internally sourced lignite,
whose price is less fully controlled by PGE Capital Group in contrary to cost of other fuels, which

prices showed upward trend in 2012.

Consolidated statement of comprehensive income

Total sales revenues of the Group in 2012 amounted to PLN 30,556.8 million, as compared to
PLN 28,111.4 million in 2011, what means growth by 8.7%. The biggest increase of revenues was
recorded in the revenues from sales of finished goods and merchandise which grew by

PLN 1,651.1 million mainly as a result of:

I. increased revenues from sales of electricity on the wholesale market and to the end

users;
Il. increase in revenues from distribution services;
Il. increase in revenues from sales of certificates of origin.

The revenues from LTC compensations, which were higher by PLN 887.8 million, also significantly

affected the sales revenues.

Cost of goods sold in 2012 amounted to PLN 22,345.2 million, i.e. it grew by ca. 8% as compared to

2011. The increase of the cost of goods sold was mainly caused by:
I. increased merchandise and materials sold;
I. increase of personnel expenses;
Il. increased cost of fuel for production.

Gross profit on sales in 2012 amounted to PLN 8,211.6 million as compared to

PLN 7,437.2 million in 2011, what means growth by ca. 10%.

In| 2012 total distribution and_ selling expenses of PGE Group amounted _ to
PLN 1,495.5 million and were lower by approximately 9% as compared to 2011. The decrease of
selling and distribution expenses was mainly associated with lower costs of redemption of property

rights incurred by PGE Obrot S.A.

General and administrative expenses in 2012 amounted to PLN 764.9 million, what means

approximately 7% decrease as compared to 2011.

Net income from other operating activities in 2012 was negative and amounted to

PLN (-) 2,080.7 million as compared to negative result in amount of PLN (-) 888.7 million in 2011.

Other operating revenues of the Group in 2012 amounted to PLN 782.7 million, what means

approximately 25% growth in relation to PLN 624.0 million achieved in 2011. The increase in other

operating revenues is mainly associated with provisions reversed higher by PLN 221.4 million and
recognition in 2012 of adjustment of revenues from LTC compensations in amount of
PLN 199.6 million with the simultaneous decrease of received compensations, penalties and fines

which were lower by PLN 301.4 million.

Other operating expenses in 2012 amounted to PLN 2,863.4 million as compared to
PLN 1,512.7 million in 2011, what means growth by approximately 89%. The growth is mainly
connected with the increase in impairment allowances raised for other assets by PLN 1,659.4 million
(mostly due to impairment allowance for non-financial assets recognised in PGE GiEK S.A. Branch
ZEDO in December 2012) and provisions created — increase by PLN 770.8 million (mostly due to
change in provision for recultivation in PGE GiEK S.A. as a result of change of applied discount rate).
In 2011 in other operating expenses Company recognized, among others, adjustment of

LTC compensations settlements by in amount of PLN 1,037.6 million.

In 2012 and 2011 the result on financial activities was positive and amounted respectively to

PLN 245.6 million and PLN 1,846.6 million.

The Group’s financial revenues in 2012 amounted to PLN 612.9 million, what means decline
by approximately 73% in relation to PLN 2,304.4 million achieved in 2011. High level of that item
in 2011 resulted from sale of Polkomtel S.A. Revenues from interests higher by PLN 168.4 million

positively affected the level of that item in 2012.

The decrease of financial expenses by PLN 90.6 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 mainly results

from:
I. foreign exchange losses lower by PLN 71.2 million;
I. cost of interest from financial instruments lower by PLN 47.8 million;
Il. interest expenses lower by PLN 26.8 million due to discount unwinding.

This decline was partly leveled by increased costs related to impairment allowances created which

were higher by PLN 66.9 million.

As a result of the factors discussed above, the gross profit of the Group in 2012 amounted

to PLN 4,102.5 million as compared to PLN 6,111.2 million in 2011.

In 2012 gross profit margin of the Group (gross profit to total sales revenues) decreased to 13% from

22% in 2011.

The net profit of the PGE Capital Group in 2012 amounted to PLN 3,233.1 million as compared
to PLN 4,928.7 million in 2011. Net profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent company
decreased in 2012 by PLN 1,681.6 million as compared to 2011 and amounted to PLN 3,211.1 million.

Total comprehensive income of the Group in 2012 amounted to PLN 3,067.6 million as compared

to PLN 4,985.6 million in 2011.
Consolidated statement of financial position

As at December 31, 2012 and as at December 31, 2011, non-current assets of the Group amounted
to respectively PLN 44,857.3 million and PLN 44,444.9 million and accounted for respectively 77%

and 76% of total assets.

The biggest change in non-current assets was observed in intangible assets, which as at
December 31, 2012 and as at December 31, 2011 amounted respectively to PLN 462.4 million and
PLN 216.9 million.

Current assets of the Group as at December 31, 2012 and as at December 31, 2011 amounted

respectively to PLN 13,396.6 million and PLN 14,317.7 million.

The decrease in the value of the Group’s current assets by PLN 921.1 million in the period ended
December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 was mainly caused
by decrease in other loans and financial assets by PLN 2,015.8 million (PLN 2,097,2 million of the
decrease was connected with termination of deposits longer than 3 months) and decrease in
CO, emission rights by PLN 476.4 million. CO2 emission rights decreased from PLN 3,367.0 million as
at the end of December 2011 to PLN 2,890.6 million as at December 31, 2012 as a result
of redemption of free allowances for 2011, that took place in April 2012. The decrease of the above
positions was partly compensated by growth in inventories by PLN 907.9 million and in cash and cash

equivalents by PLN 743.3 million.

Increase of inventories in the period ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2011 mainly resulted from increased level of CO emission rights intended for trading,

certificates of energy origin and materials.
Cash and cash equivalents were described in the part relating to cash flow statement.

As at December 31, 2012 and as at December 31, 2011 total equity of the Group amounted
respectively to PLN 40,671.8 million and PLN 41,113.6 million. Non-controlling interest as at

December 31, 2012 and as at December 31, 2011 amounted respectively to PLN 289.5 million and
PLN 414.0 million.

The decrease of total equity by PLN 441.8 million was caused by recognition of the distribution
of profit for 2011 and part of retained earnings in amount of PLN 3,422,5 million for dividend
payment. Recognition of the net profit for the period ended December 31, 2012 in amount

of PLN 3,233.1 million positively affected the total equity.

The long-term liabilities as at December 31, 2012 amounted to PLN 8,395.3 million and were higher
by PLN 1,119.6 million than as at December 31, 2011. The change in long-term liabilities mainly
reflected higher provisions raised (particularly provision for recultivation costs higher by
PLN 974.5 million), debt due to bank loans, borrowings, bonds and lease lower by PLN 256.1 million

and deferred income and government grants lower by PLN 130.5 million.

Short-term liabilities decreased from PLN 10,373.4 million as at December 31, 2011
to PLN 9,186.9 million as at December 31, 2012 mainly due to decrease of short-term provisions by
PLN 956.4 million, decrease of other financial liabilities by PLN 280.3 million and income tax liabilities
by PLN 183.4 million. The described negative divergence was partly compensated by increase
in short-term part of interest-bearing loans, borrowings, bonds and by PLN 113.8 million and in trade

liabilities by PLN 84.7 million.

Short-term provisions decreased from PLN 4,634.5 million as at December 31, 2011 to
PLN 3,678.1 million as at December 31, 2012 resulted from utilization of provision for CO, emission

rights and reversal of part of provision for third party claims.

The change in other financial liabilities from PLN 1,826.6 million as at December 31, 2011
to PLN 1,546.3 million as at December 31, 2012 mainly resulted from increased liabilities related to
LTC compensations, increased liabilities related to deposits and guarantees and lower liabilities

related to purchase of property, plant and equipment.

Increase in short-term part of interest-bearing loans, borrowings, bonds is a result of increased
current account credits with simultaneous repayment of a loan by PGE GiEK S.A. Branch Elektrownia

2.4.1.1 Financial data

In 2012 total sales revenues for Conventional Generation amounted to PLN 15,081.7 million, which
means 11% growth as compared to 2011. EBIT of the segment in 2012 amounted to PLN 2,013.1
million, and EBITDA amounted to PLN 3,724.9 million. In the previous year EBIT amounted to
PLN 2,953.5 million, and EBITDA amounted to PLN 4,491.3 million. Decrease of EBIT in 2012 as

compared to 2011 mainly resulted from:

I. Recognition of impairment of assets in amount of PLN 1,485.9 million in PGE GiEK Branch

ZEDO in December 2012,

ll. Increase in provisions for recultivation and actuarial provisions resulting from modified

assumptions for the discount rate level,
Ill. increased cost of redundancy compensations due to the Voluntary Leave Program and
IV. recognition of impairment of the CCS project.

This decline was partly compensated by revenues from LTC compensations higher by PLN 887.8
million and settlements regarding revaluation of LTC receivables higher by PLN 1,237.2 million, which

was recognised in other operations.

In 2012 capital expenditures in Conventional Generation amounted to PLN 2,767.8 million as

I. Review of main issues regarding resources
Lignite quality parameters

The quality of lignite in Betchatow and Turéw mines was originally assessed during an archaeological
examination of the coal layer. Additionally, boreholes at individual coal layers enabled to carry out
coal quality tests. Results of the examinations are available in an electronic version and in paper
records. The table below shows average quality parameters of lignite found in deposits owned by

PGE GiEK S.A. with a reference to balance resources.

Long-term projects

Current lignite deposits in Kopalnia Betchatow and Kopalnia Tur6w mines ensure a stable output
level until 2030. Following that year, output will gradually decrease. In order to ensure continuity of
operations and protect the value of the Capital Group, based on advanced and efficient generating
methods, lignite surveys are conducted with a view to obtain the extraction permit with regard to

lignite deposits in “Ztoczew” and “Gubin”.

Projects completed in 2012 involved exploratory drilling in the “Ztoczew” deposit. Geological

documentation is currently being compiled.

The “Ztoczew” deposit contains 485,622 million Mg of lignite resources supposed economic and
12,938 million Mg of subeconomic resources. Similarly to the Betchatéw deposit, the “Ztoczew”
deposit takes the form of a rift valley. Deposits filling the valley consist of sand and miocene silt and
a single lignite seam of a thickness of 16.1m to 111.4m with an average thickness of 46.2m. The coal
seam’s depth reaches 338m. The thickness of the subdeposit varies from 146.8m to 297.9m (210m

on average), and the N:W ratio (relation of the subdeposit to the amount of coal) varies from 1.9 to

9.1 — 4.6 on average. Quality parameters of lignite in the deposit: ash content 21.82%; sulphur
content: 1,17%; calorific value: 2017kcal/kg (8445kJ/kg).

Current activities with regard to the “Gubin” deposit involve necessary arrangements and decisions

as well as compilation of documents required for a permit application to be filed.

The Gubin deposit belongs to the so-called miocene layer with coal characterised by the best
suitability for industrial purposes. These are deposits which in morphological and structural terms
belong to almost flat seam deposits most often composed of 1 or 2 seams. Results of conducted
geological research are contained in Exhibit 1 to the complex geological documentation of the Gubin
deposit; it comprises information on the “Gubin” and “Gubin-Zasieki-Brody” deposits covering
4 decades of research carried out on these deposits. According to the documentation, lignite
resources amounted to: resources supposed economic — 1,561,015 million Mg and subeconomic

resources — 63,659 million Mg.
Current rehabilitation operations

The law in force provides for the obligation to rehabilitate post-mining land. The rehabilitation duty
applies to natural and legal persons who cease production activities on exploited land which
consequently loses its use value. Therefore, mines conduct rehabilitation work on post-mining land,

where mining activities are discontinued.

A. Betchatow lignite mine

Rehabilitation operations of post-mining land are currently carried out on the internal dump, south
and north settling ponds of Field Betchatéw, the external dump of Field Szczercéw and other land
belonging to Field Betchatéw. Mainly, operations cover advanced rehabilitation of newly prepared
dumping areas selected for biological reclamation as well as restoration of land excluded from

mining exploitation.

Activities carried out in Field Betchatéw in 2012 included:
x advanced rehabilitation on land on an area of 15.698ha;

x basic rehabilitation of the internal dump on an area of 12.05ha and advanced rehabilitation on

an area of 10.36ha.

Activities carried out in Field Szczercow in 2012 included:
x basic rehabilitation consisting in land shaping of the external dump on an area of 95.0ha;

x advanced rehabilitation involving turfing and afforestation of banks and shelves on an area of

13.0ha.

B. Turdw lignite mine

Current rehabilitation operations are performed based on an official decision under which land
rehabilitated in the pit should be reforested. In 2012, rehabilitation on post-mining land involved
reforestation on an area of 3.99ha. Supplementations and additional forestation covered an area of
22.65ha. Along with forestation, operations conducted on rehabilitated grounds included land
neutralisation and application of a grass mix and papilionaceous plants. Furthermore, basic and
supplementary fertilisation was applied to areas of land which had been rehabilitated earlier. The
treatment was performed on an area of 47.41ha. Silviculture operations included late clean-up of
young trees and bushes on an area of 55ha. Rehabilitation is carried out systematically on lands
which are successively made available following termination of mining activities. Technical
rehabilitation comprised water system re-engineering. Ditch R, which had earlier been damaged, was
reconstructed (the length of the restored section was 482m); hydrotechnical infrastructure
developed as part of technical rehabilitation was systematically repaired. In addition, rehabilitation
covered technical and biological treatment of wash erosions (erosion length exceeding 16,000 linear

metres).
Il. Rehabilitation and provision for mine rehabilitation
A. Mine Liquidation Fund

Pursuant to the provisions the Geological and Mining Act, business operators extracting minerals in
open-pit mines must contribute to the Mine Liquidation Fund an amount equivalent to 10% of the
charged exploitation fee; raised funds must be deposited on a separate bank account. The Fund is

charged to the costs of open-pit mining operations. The transfer of funds takes place on a monthly

basis and the amount contributed depends on the extraction output achieved in the reporting

period. Interest earned on the Mine Liquidation Funds increase the value of the Fund.

In 2012:
x The provision made for the Fund by Branch KWB Betchatow amounted to PLN 6.7 million. As at

December 31, 2012, the funds gathered amounted to PLN 73.0 million;

x The provision made for the fund by Branch KWB Turow amounted to PLN 1.7 million. As at
December 31, 2012, the funds gathered amounted to PLN 22.7 million.

B. Provisions for post-mining land rehabilitation

Mines belonging to the Group make provisions for expenses to be incurred for the rehabilitation of
land where mining operations ended. The amount of the provision is determined based on projected
costs of rehabilitation operations and the final pit improvement. As regards mining excavations, the
provision is fixed in the amount depending on the ratio of coal produced to total projected coal
output from a deposit in the entire period of exploitation. Estimates of anticipated rehabilitation
expenses are updated not less frequently than every five years, with the reservation that the value of
the provision is verified each year against current assumptions regarding the inflation rate, discount

rates and extraction output.

The provision corresponding to the output in a given year is charged to operating costs while the
difference resulting from changed macroeconomic assumptions, i.e.: inflation rate or discount rates,
is charged to other operating expenses or revenues. The unwinding of the discount effect is charged

to the financial cost.

In 2012:

x the provision for rehabilitation (together with the contribution to the Mine Liquidation Fund)
made by KWB Betchatow rose by PLN 578.0 million, of which PLN 523.4 million was attributed to
significant changes in discount rates. As at December 31, 2012, the amount of the provision

together with the contribution to the Mine Liquidation Fund was PLN 1,226.5 million.

x the provision for rehabilitation (together with the contribution to the Mine Liquidation Fund)
made by KWB Turow rose by PLN 367.2 million, of which PLN 341.0 million was attributed to
significant changes in discount rates. As at December 31, 2012, the amount of the provision

together with the contribution to the Mine Liquidation Fund was PLN 791.5 million.

2.4.3. Wholesale trading

In 2011 total sales revenues in the Wholesale Trading amounted to PLN 10,648.9 million, which
means an approximately 4% increase as compared to 2011. EBIT of the segment in 2012 amounted
to PLN 554.8 million, and EBITDA amounted to PLN 574.1 million. In the previous year EBIT
amounted to PLN 178.6 million, and EBITDA amounted to PLN 202.1 million. Higher EBIT in 2012 as
compared to 2011 was mainly caused by higher remuneration for additional services rendered for
PGE GiEK after the execution in 2012 of the Agreement on Commercial Management of Generation
Capacities and higher result on other operations (mainly due to reversal of provision on reservation

of interconnector capacities and reversal of provision for claims related to transmission services).

In 2011 capital expenditures in the Wholesale Trading amounted to PLN 4.7 million as compared to
PLN 10.0 million in 2011. Capital expenditures related mainly to modernization of the building, in

which company has its registered office, along with accompanying infrastructure.

2.4.4. Distribution
2.4.4.1 Financial data

In 2012 total sales revenues in the Distribution segment amounted to PLN 5,538.7 million, as
compared to PLN 5,253.0 million in 2011. EBIT of the segment in 2012 amounted to PLN 1,029.0
million, and EBITDA amounted to PLN 1,970.0 million. In the previous year EBIT amounted to PLN
703.3 million, and EBITDA amounted to PLN 1,617.3 million. Growth of EBIT by approximately 46%
mainly resulted from higher revenues from sale of distribution services, what is connected with the
change in average distribution tariffs in particular groups and slightly higher volume of energy

distributed. Additionally EBIT was affected by higher result on other operations.

In 2012 capital expenditures in the Distribution segment amounted to PLN 1,338.8 million, as
compared to PLN 1,254.6 million in 2011. In 2012 capital expenditures mainly related to connection
of new customers to the distribution network (PLN 566.6 million) and construction and

modernization of the grid, substations and electro energy lines (PLN 462.3 million).

million in 2011 and were mainly related to expenditures for IT and customer support systems.

2.4.5.2 Information on operating activities

Retail sale of the Group is dealt with by the PGE Obrot S.A. The company's operations involve trading
in electricity in all the country. The company supplies to more than 5 million customers: businesses,

local self-government units and households.

Revenues are mainly generated from electricity sales to final customers and sales of distribution
services under master agreements. The main costs of operation in the segment are costs of
electricity purchase (see Section 2.1.3. Electricity prices) and expenses incurred in compliance with
the obligation to buy units of ownership which are subject to remittance under the System of
Support for Renewable and Cogeneration Energy Sources. As an alternative, a substitute fee may be

contributed.

2.5. Supply markets

Provision of raw materials

Lignite, hard coal, natural gas and biomass are key fuels used to generate electricity and heat by

power plants and heat and power plants belonging to the PGE Group.
The cost of fuel procurement constitutes a major share in electricity generation costs.

Lignite supplies are carried out within a framework of regular cooperation between branches
operating in the Company’s structure. The KWB Betchatow mine supplies lignite to the Elektrownia
Betchatow plant and the KWB Turdéw mine supplies it the Elektrownia Turow plant. The Company set
up internal rules with respect to the performance and settlement of lignite supplies between
individual branches of the Company. The stipulations, which took the form of internal instructions,

provide a detailed definition and description of mutual settlements of lignite supplies.

PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. purchases hard coal from several producers and suppliers in
order to secure supplies for power plants and CHP plants belonging to PGE GiEK S.A. The main
supplier is Kompania Weglowa S.A. with an approximate share of 65% in the yearly demand for this

raw material.

Considering the significant share of Kompania Weglowa S.A. in hard coal supplies, lack of this

supplier would cause a neccesity of new purchase contracts on the market.

Natural gas for electricity and heat production (co-generation) is mainly supplied by the company
Polskie Gérnictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo S.A. (“PGNiG S.A.”). Due to contracts for gas supply signed
in the past by PGE S.A. with PGNiG S.A. and conditions thereof, the PGE Group is significantly

dependent on this supplier.

Until the beginning of 2012, biomass supplies to generators from the PGE Capital Group were mostly
ensured by companies within the PGE Capital Group or companies not belonging to the Group (acting
as agents), or they were obtained directly from biomass producers. On August 28, 2011, the Long-
Term Agreement for the Sale of Biomass to all branches of the PGE Capital Group was signed with a
view to consolidate the biomass supplies. On December 23, 2011, PGE GiEK S.A. and Elbis sp. z 0.0.
signed the Annual Contract for the Sale of Biomass (“Contract”) in the year 2012. Under successive
annexes to the Contract, supplies of biomass were transferred to all branches of the PGE Capital
Group. Due to diversity of the Elbis sp. z 0.0. company’s suppliers, the PGE Capital Group is not

dependent on any of the biomass suppliers.
Purchases of transmission and distribution services

Under the existing legislation, power undertakings in Poland:

1. must have a valid Agreement for the Provision of Electricity Transmission Services signed
with a Transmission System Operator (“TSO”) in order to be able to sell electricity on

wholesale markets;

2. must have a valid Agreement for the Provision of Electricity Distribution Services signed with

a Distribution System Operator (“DSO”) for other sale of electricity;

3. must have valid agreements concluded both with a TSO and a DSO - if required due to the

scope of operations.

In view of the above obligations, companies dealing with generation, trade and distribution of
electricity in Poland (including entities in the PGE Group) are, directly or indirectly, dependent on
agreements for the provision of transmission services, which provide for rules with regard to the
settlement of services rendered to a TSO and methods for settling energy divergences of Generating
and Receiving Units arising as a result of balancing the domestic electricity demand by the Operator.
Agreements for the provision of transmission services are made with the company PSE S.A., which is
responsible for the operation of the National Power Grid and ensuring adequate amounts of energy
flows (exports or imports) on exchange channels of connected systems. Pursuant to the provisions of
the Energy Law, the above mentioned services may be provided exclusively by a TSO. Power
undertakings engaged in generation, whose power units are connected to the TSO’s transmission
grid, are required to submit valid agreements for the sale of electricity to the TSO. The obligation
referred to above creates dependency of a systemic nature which additionally affects companies
within the PGE Group to the extent defined by law and determined by the scope and character of
their operations. Termination or expiry of the mentioned agreements while the terms of a new
transmission agreement between a power undertaking and the TSO are not agreed leads in practice
to a request being filed by one party with the President of the Energy Regulatory Office to establish

the terms of the agreement.

Furthermore, generators within the PGE Group are dependent on agreements regarding the
provision of ancillary services rendered to the TSO by the generating units of companies. Agreements
on ancillary services constitute an integral part of agreements for the provision of transmission
services. They are concluded for a period of one year by PSE S.A. exclusively. Importantly, the failure

to agree terms under transmission agreements in the part relating to ancillary services does not
1 IE CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012

V

release a power undertaking from the obligation to provide the service, e.g. power control in the

system.

In 2012, services purchased from PSE S.A. accounted totally for approx. 7% of operating costs

incurred by the Group. PSE S.A. is related to PGE S.A. as a company controlled by the State Treasury.
Purchases of electricity

In 2012, pursuant to the electricity trading model applied in the PGE Group, the Group’s generators
sold electricity on power exchanges (under the provisions of art. 49a section 1 and 2 of the Energy
Law, i.e. under the so-called “power exchange obligation”), to PGE S.A. and to external customers.
Energy purchased by PGE S.A. was sold to the companies of the PGE Group, including to the Retail
Sales company and the Distribution company, to contractors from outside the PGE Group as well as
on domestic and international markets. In addition, the Retail Sales company in the PGE Group
purchased energy from local generating sources located in the areas where the company acts as

a supplier of last resort.

2.6. Description of material agreements

2.6.1. Project of construction of units in PGE GiEK S.A. Branch Elektrownia
Opole. Signing of a material agreement.

On February 15, 2012 PGE Elektrownia Opole S.A. (currently PGE GiEK S.A. Branch Elektrownia
Opole), concluded an agreement with Rafako S.A., Polimex-Mostostal S.A. and Mostostal Warszawa
S.A. (the ,Agreement”), forming a syndicate: Rafako S.A., Polimex-Mostostal S.A. and Mostostal
Warszawa S.A. (later referred to as the ,,General Contractor”). The net value of the Agreement
amounts to PLN 9.4 billion, while gross value of the Agreement amounts to PLN 11.6 billion. Subject
matter of the agreement is construction of two hard coal-fired 900 MW supercritical power units no
5&6 at PGE Elektrownia Opole S.A. by the General Contractor. The project will be executed in EPC
formula (Engineering, Procurement, Construction). According to the Agreement, the General
Contractor is obliged to execute the order within 54 months from the date of the Notice To Proceed

January 12, 2012 the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw, after examination of the complaint
by ClientEarth Poland Foundation to the decision of General Director of Environment Protection of
August 16, 2011 on setting up the environmental conditionings for the realization of the project,
overruled decisions of first and second instance (Regional Director of Environment Protection in
Opole and General Director of Environment Protection in Warsaw) with regard to environmental
permit for units 5&6. In connection with the above, on March 14, 2012 PGE GiEK S.A. filed a
cassation appeal with the Supreme Administrative Court against the decision of the Provincial
Administrative Court in Warsaw of January 12, 2012. On October 2, 2012 the Supreme Administrative
Court repealed the verdict of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw of January 12, 2012 and

remitted the case for re-examination, issuing binding recommendations for the re-examination.

On February 19, 2013 the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw (“PAC”) dismissed appeal of

3. Financial and market risk management

In their business activity, Group companies become parties to various types of agreements and

financial contracts subject to non-financial risks.

During regular business activity, Group’s operations, financial results and cash flows are exposed to
various types of financial and market risks, including interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, price
risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. Each risk could have a negative impact on business activities,

financial standing and performance of operations.
3.1. Interest rate risk

The companies of the PGE Capital Group are exposed to interest rate risk since their operating and
investing activities are financed from debt borrowed at a variable interest rate or through
investments in financial assets remunerated at a floating or fixed interest rate. On the other hand,
financing activities through debt borrowed at a fixed interest rate is associated with the risk of lost

profits when interest rates fall.

The rates of floating rate financial instruments are updated in periods of time shorter than one year.
Interest earned on financial instruments with a fixed interest rate are constant throughout the

period preceding their maturity.

Cash and cash equivalents are reflected in the group of floating rate instruments. Most of the cash
and cash equivalents are short-term deposits (less than 3 months) at a fixed interest rate. Due to the
risk of changing rates in the process of negotiating interest rate levels in subsequent periods, the

Group presents them in the group of higher risk.

The Group is exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of SWAP derivatives resulting from

changes in interest rates.
HIE CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012

V

3.2. Foreign exchange risk

The PGE Group companies are affected by two types of exposure to foreign exchange risk:
Exposure to transaction risk

It stems from the fact that a part of the cash flows from the core business of the companies is
denominated or indexed to foreign exchange rates. Furthermore, transaction risk is created as
a result of using foreign currencies to capital investments and to finance operations. Due to changes
in foreign exchange rates, the foreign exchange risk translates into the variability of future cash flows

denominated/indexed in foreign currencies.
Translation exposure

It arises from converting balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies into the currency of
the financial statements, i.e. the Polish zloty. Similarly to the transaction exposure, a lack of
assurance as to the level of future exchange rates to be applied in the conversion of data in the
financial statements on the balance sheet day leads to uncertainty as to the value of the items in
Polish zloty on the balance sheet day and related revenues and/or financial costs due to exchange

rate differences shown in the total income statement.

Major elements which constitute sources of exposure to foreign exchange risk of the Group are

presented below:

x Capital expenses denominated/indexed to foreign exchange rates;

x Debt of the companies belonging to the Group and denominated in foreign currencies;
x Electricity sale transactions in exports denominated in foreign currencies;

x Electricity purchase transactions denominated in foreign currencies and electricity purchase

transactions where part of the purchase price is indexed to the exchange rate;
x Fees for the purchase transmission capacity denominated/indexed to foreign exchange rates;
x Sales of CO, emission rights denominated/indexed to foreign exchange rates;
x Purchases of CO, emission rights denominated/indexed to foreign exchange rates;

x Expenses related to the current use of capital goods denominated/indexed to foreign exchange

rates;

x Invested financial assets denominated in foreign currencies.
MANAGEMENT BOARD'S REPORT ON ACTIVITIES | H IE CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012

“DCE

3.3. Commodity price risk

Due to the nature of their operations the companies in the PGE Capital Group are exposed to cash

flow and financial results volatility caused by changes in prices of the following risk items:
x Electricity;

x Heat energy;

x Hard coal;

x Natural gas;

x CO, emission rights;

x Property rights to certificates of origin for electricity generated from renewable energy sources

(“green certificates”) or from cogeneration (“red/yellow certificates”).
3.4. Credit Risk

The credit risk is related with potential credit defaults such as a counterparty's insolvency,
incomplete repayment or significant delay in the repayment of a debt or other default on contractual

terms.
Companies of the PGE Capital Group are exposed to credit risk arising in the following areas:

x Core business of the companies — sources of credit risk include inter alia transactions for the sale

or purchase of electricity and heat, purchases and sales of mining fuels, etc.

x Investing activities undertaken by the companies — the credit risk is generated by transactions
within investment projects where successful completion is subject to the financial standing of the

Group's suppliers.

x Market risk management in the Group - the credit risk is linked to possible non-performance of
obligations by the other party in a derivative transaction to the detriment of a company
belonging to the PGE Capital Group if the fair value of the derivative transaction is positive from

the Group's point of view.

x Investing the companies' available funds — the credit risk arises if available funds are invested by
the companies of the PGE Capital Group in financial instruments involving credit risk, i.e. financial

instruments other than issued by the State Treasury.
MANAGEMENT BOARD'S REPORT ON ACTIVITIES | H IE CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012

“DCE

The following classes of financial instruments are vulnerable to credit risk exposure and have distinct
credit risk characteristics:

x Current and long-term deposits;

x Acquired bonds, bills of exchange and other bonds;

x Trade receivables;

x Loans granted;

x Other financial receivables;

x Cash and cash equivalents;

x Derivatives;

x Granted guarantees.

The maximum exposure to credit risk related to financial assets of the Group is equal to the carrying

values of these items.

The primary objective of credit risk management is to approve and control the credit risk at a level
which is defined based on major business targets with respect to traded electricity and related
products. The credit risk management of a counterparty in PGE S.A. and units belonging to the PGE
Capital Group, which are exposed to losses to the largest extent because of a counterparty's credit
risk, bases on policies and procedures adopted to this respect. In order to reduce a counterparty's
credit risk, trading operations with customers generating a potentially high credit risk are subject to
limits assigned on the basis of credit ratings. Customers displaying a weak financial standing may be
required to provide a security. Securities with a high recovery rate are preferred. Payments from
contractors and credit risk exposure are monitored on a regular basis. Recovery procedures and

processes are applied in order to minimise losses related to untimely payments from a counterparty.

3.5. Liquidity risk

PGE Group companies run active cash investment policy. This means that they monitor their financial

surplus, forecast future cash flows and carry out their investment strategy on the basis thereof.

PGE Group companies are individually responsible for their current liquidity, which is mainly based
on current account credits. The Group has implemented a central financing process. PGE S.A. issues
bonds, which are acquired, without limitation, by entities with financial surplus. Funds from the issue
are then used to acquire bonds issued by those of PGE Group companies that indicate need for

external sources of financing.

4. Risks and threats of the PGE Capital Group

The activity of major PGE Capital Group companies, as well as other entities operating in the
electrical and power sector, is exposed to a number of external risks and threats connected with
market, regulatory and legal environment, as well as internal risks and threats accompanying their

operations.

Key risks and threats, to which the PGE Capital Group’s activity is exposed, are described below.

4.1. Risk factors connected with market environment and_ general

macroeconomic situation in Poland and in the world

4.1.1. Risk connected with macroeconomic situation

The operations of PGE Group are affected mainly by macroeconomic factors related to Polish
economy, such as interest rates, PLN exchange rate, inflation rate, unemployment rate, Polish GDP,
changes in directions of the economic and tax policy of the state, and also volatility of prices of
electricity, fuel, CO. emission rights, and availability of materials used for production of electric
power and heat. Other than factors associated with Polish economy, Group’s operations are also
affected by macroeconomic conditions in other countries, particularly other Member States of the
European Union. Any deterioration of the general economic conditions in Poland or in the world may

considerably and negatively impact the operations, performance or financial standing of the Group.

4.1.2. Risk relating to an increasing competition

Given the on-going development of the retail market, increasing activity of energy sellers and
growing number of customers who change their energy supplier, the PGE Group is exposed to the
risk of losing its existing customers in the retail market and the risk of decreased margin achieved on

sale to the existing customers.

4.1.3. Risk of a decrease in demand for electricity and heat

The PGE Capital Group’s income is substantially dependant on the consumption of power and heat
by the users. In a long run, power consumption is expected to grow. However, there is no guarantee

that such a growth will occur and that the rate of growth will achieve an assumed level.

Demand for electricity may decline, in particular, as a result of:
x economic slowdown,
x possible reduction of energy consumption level by off-takers of low economic standing,
x development of new energy saving technologies,
x weather conditions.

Decreasing growth rate of demand for electricity and limited access to interconnectors limiting
opportunities for exporting electricity produced by the Group may have a significant adverse impact

on the activity and financial results of Group companies.

Uncertainty regarding future economic situation in the world’s economy, intensified by the financial
crisis in European countries, may negatively affect the domestic consumption and investments,
subsequently leading to decreased demand for electricity and drop of electricity prices, what was

observed in 2012.

4.2. Risk factors connected with regulatory and legal environment

4.2.1. Political risk

The activity of the PGE Group in key operating areas, i.e. lignite mining, generation, distribution and
sale of electricity and heat, is subject to legislation, government regulation and government policy
adopted by Polish authorities and agencies, authorities of the European Communities and the
European Union, and other states. Changes in such legislation, regulations and/or policies may be
influenced by political factors, which in turn may affect business activity of the Group including, inter
alia, the regulation of electricity prices, heat prices and distribution services for off takers, in
particular households. It is particularly relevant for investments in the generating segment as they
are characterised by high capital expenses and a long implementation period (in case of nuclear
power plants it is 10 years and more including the preparation phase). A stable and coherent energy
policy based on capacity balancing and supporting an assumed target fuel mix, and at the same time
involving mechanisms enabling the State to carry out necessary investments, not necessarily
profitable from a purely business perspective but required in order to secure the energy security of

the State, will lead to the completion of all necessary investment projects in the generation segment.

4.2.2. Risk of instability of legal environment

The Group’s activity is subject to numerous Polish and European laws and regulations and

international law. The provisions of the laws, regulations, decisions, positions, opinions and actions
MANAGEMENT BOARD'S REPORT ON mT He CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012
(catkins al

“DCE

of relevant authorities important for the Group’s activity are subject to changes. In particular, the
Energy Law was repeatedly amended, and some of the amendments introduced significant changes
with respect to core business areas. Types, directions and scopes of such amendments may have an

unpredictable impact on the Group’s activity.

Moreover, environment protection regulations become more strict, and adjustment to these
changes may be connected with the additional significant expenditures. Non-compliance with regard
to environment protection requirements may lead to PGE Group responsibility, including financial

sanctions or periodical or even permanent suspension of exploitation of particular installations.

4.2.3. Risk associated with amendments to the support schemes for renewable
and cogeneration sources

In previous years, generators in Group, who provided electricity in combination with heat
(cogeneration), benefited from a scheme supporting highly efficient generators. Under the applicable
regulations, the scheme supporting highly efficient cogeneration based on certificates of origin (the
so-called yellow certificates — for installations fired with gaseous fuels or of a total installed capacity
below 1 MW, and red certificates — for units fired with fuels other than gas, of a total installed
capacity of more than 1 MW) operated until December 31, 2012 (energy produced in 2012 will be
settled by March 31, 2013). As from December 31, 2012 the support expired.

The amendments to the Energy Law, which are currently discussed at the Ministry of Economy,
assume the possibility of renewal of the support scheme for cogeneration sources, but neither the
form nor the duration or beginning date of the new support scheme have been definitively
determined. The rules governing these issues should enter into force yet this year. Any amendment
to the legislation affecting the process of acquiring the certificates of origin is usually associated with
the need to adapt the technical infrastructure or measures necessary for the acquisition of the
certificates to the requirements set out in new provisions. Delays in the adaptation process or lack of
adaptive measures by the Group's generators may lead to substantial financial losses (e.g. due to
formal or procedural reasons) caused by a subsequent refusal by the President of the Energy

Regulatory Office to issue the energy certificates.

The proposed amendments create the risk that the support scheme for cogeneration units will not
be renewed or will be extended under less favourable conditions than the current requirements
relating to the certificates of origin; consequently, it would adversely affect revenues and returns of

cogeneration units of the Group who are benefiting from support schemes.
MANAGEMENT BOARD'S REPORT ON mr He CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012
(catkins al

“DCE

The same applies to the Group's units generating electricity from renewable energy sources as they
also benefit from the support scheme. According to the draft new renewable energy act, which is
currently in the legislation process, the present support scheme designed for units generating
electricity from renewable sources and stipulated by the Energy Law will be changed, i.e. it will
differentiate various types of renewable energy, installed capacity of energy generating equipment
and the date of installation commissioning or upgrade. In the publicly available project of the act,
less support is foreseen for technology processes which now generate the highest share of electricity
from renewable sources (wind power plants, co-combustion) while renewable energy installations of
more than 15 years and multi-fuel firing combustion plants (co-combustion) of more than 5 years will
no longer be eligible for the certificates of origin. If the proposed provisions with respect to
renewable energy sources are passed in their current form, they will adversely impact the
profitability of both existing and planned renewable energy plants in the PGE Capital Group.
Furthermore, support for renewable energy sources leads to risks of not obtaining the certificates of
origin (the so-called green certificates). They are granted by the decision of the President of the
Energy Regulatory Office who nevertheless is entitled to challenge quantities and methods of
certified energy generation by a generator and consequently to withhold a decision to grant all or

some of the certificates.

4.2.4. Risk connected with the requirement for licenses

The Group’s core activity is subject to a number of licenses, including licenses for the electricity and
heat generation, the distribution of electricity and heat, the electricity and heat trading, the fuel gas
trading, as well as for the lignite mining. In order to continue business activity, the Group needs to
maintain and extend existing licenses. Any withdrawal or limitation of licenses or the imposition of
additional conditions under the license may cause that Group companies will not be able to run their

activities, their activities will be significantly limited or substantially influenced otherwise.

4.2.5. Risk resulting from the potential violation of antitrust regulations

Distribution company of the PGE Group is a natural monopolist in the area of electricity distribution
services. In addition the PGE Group is the main electricity producer in Poland (approximately 40%
share in the electricity generation market) and is one of the biggest electricity sellers in Poland. Given
its monopolist or dominant position in relevant markets, the PGE Group is subject to limitations in
the form of a ban on overusing its dominant position based on antitrust regulations of the Polish law

and the law of the European Union. In the case of any violation thereof, antitrust authorities (the
MANAGEMENT BOARD'S REPORT ON mT He CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012
(catkins al

“DCE

President of the Office for Consumer and Competition Protection, European Commission) may order

to take up defined actions or enforce sanctions in the form of financial penalties.

4.2.6. Risk connected with the programme of CO, emissions reduction

In Poland CO, emission rights are granted for the particular branches and enterprises by way of
decree of the Council of Ministers through National Allocation Plan (“NAP”) from the pool granted by
the European Commission (“EC”). The allocation system assumes that the enterprises which used up
their limits must acquire emission rights (EUA, CER or ERU) on the market or take steps in order to
improve the CO, emission rate. Threat of too low limits of allowances in relation to needs creates
significant concern for the energy generators, because they are granted a separate allowances
allocation. If the allowances granted to them are not sufficient to accomplish the planned generation
level, they will be forced to reduce the production (to adjust emissions to the granted limits) or incur

additional costs related to purchase of missing allowances.

Poland's application for the allocation under the EU Emissions Trading System of free emission
allowances to the Polish energy sector in the 3rd settlement period starting after the year 2012 was
conditionally approved by the European Commission. In the third settlement period, allocations of
free allowances to plants generating electricity will be gradually reduced until their total expiry in

2020.

At the European level, a strong group is lobbying for an increase of the Community CO, reduction
target, in particular after 2020. In accordance with the 2008 climate package, the European Union
and the Member States undertook to reduce their CO, emissions by 20% (Poland by 15%) by the year
2020 in relation to the base year (1990); the level of CO, emission reduction after that period is
subject to on-going negotiation. Poland does not support the plan proposed by the European
Commission leading to a practically emission-free energy generation (Energy Roadmap 2050) and, so
far, has vetoed the proposed path of CO, emission reduction in the EU economy by 80% in the year
2050. Considering the present trend, it should be expected that further proposals by the European
Commission will aim at raising the CO, emission reduction targets and promoting the increase in

emission rights’ prices.

The above issues may lead to significant growth of electricity prices on Polish market, what could
result in decline of volume of electricity sales and negatively affect the future financial situation of
the Group. At the same time, from 2014, the opening of the regional market will create a substantial
risk of revenue losses caused by a lack of competitiveness of generation sources using lignite and

hard coal on which PGE Capital Group bases its operations.

4.2.7. Risk of restrictions with respect to emissions to the environment of
substances other than CO, and of more stringent BAT standards

Operations conducted by the companies of the Group, including in particular electricity and heat
generation, are connected with emissions of not only CO,, but also NO,, SO,, dusts and other
substances. In order to minimize their impact on the environment and to protect it, EU and national
authorities introduce relevant legislation applying, among others, to the energy and mining sector.
Issues of environmental protection and related obligations are stipulated in the so-called ”integrated
permits” or sectoral permits, and installations which are obliged to obtain the permits must also
comply with the requirements of the Best Available Techniques (“BAT”) and this means substantial
capital expenses. In addition to general conditions relating to pollution emissions, the permits
provide for quotas of gas or dust emissions to the air, permissible noise levels, requirements
regarding water extraction, quantities of sewage and solid waste and define the general rules for

waste generation and handling.

Regulations with respect to environmental protection are subject to very frequent amendments and,
therefore, the implementation of more stringent environmental requirements into Polish law
should be anticipated in the nearest perspective. Predicting the exact nature and scope of the
amendments discussed is not possible. At the beginning of 2013, Directive of 24 November 2010 on
industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control), called IED, was to be transposed
to national law, however legislative work is still ongoing. IED Directive sets out stricter requirements
with respect to pollution emission limits (including emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and
dusts from energy combustion plants) compared to regulations previously in force (LCP Directive
among others) and extends the role of BAT reference documents (the so-called BREFs). Another risk
is associated with the possible adoption of the so-called BAT Conclusions, which will provide for
much more stringent emission standards than those defined in the IED Directive; the new standards

will be mandatory.

The European Commission is presently working on the amendment to the so-called framework
directive and the Commission's Decision 2000/532/EC of 3 May 2000 establishing the list of
hazardous waste. At present, some of the combustion by-products, including in particular slags,
bottom ash and boiler combustion ash, are not classified as hazardous waste. Following the
amendments they may be considered as such. Their amended status may have significantly adverse
financial consequences for the operators concerned because of higher charges for waste storage,

higher costs of rehabilitation of combustion by-products landfills and the ban on sales of combustion
MANAGEMENT BOARD'S REPORT ON ACTIVITIES | H IE CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012

“DCE

waste to external parties which, consequently, will compel operators to store all combustion by-

products by themselves.

More restrictive emission standards may force the PGE Group to incur substantial capital expenses in
order to adapt to new requirements. At the same time, some of our facilities, landfill sites or
installations may not be able to adapt to newly applicable requirements or will be able to adapt only
with a delay causing negative impacts to our activities, financial results and situation or development

prospects.

4.3. Risk factors connected with the operating activity of the PGE Capital

Group

4.3.1. Risk of disruption of fuel supplies and insufficient stocks of fuel

The generation of electricity and heat by Group power plants, CHP plants and heat plants depends on
fuel supplies, including lignite, hard coal and gas. There is a risk of disruptions in fuel supplies to
generating units, mainly for technical reasons (breakdown), natural reasons (calamities, difficult
weather conditions), social reasons (strikes), economic and political reasons (limited supply of fuel or
transport services and imposing unfavourable conditions of supply and transport) and other reasons.
Any break or limitation in fuel supplies may cause a break or significant limitation in electricity or

heat generation.

Moreover, the Energy Law obliges every electricity or heat generating enterprise to maintain a stock
of fuel in an amount that can guarantee the continuity of electricity and heat supply. The ERO
President imposes fines (of up to 15% of income) for the failure to maintain the required level of fuel
stocks. The shortage of required level of fuel stocks may also result in the suspension or reduction of

electricity or heat generation.

4.3.2. Risk connected with mining site rehabilitation expenses

Our mines must rehabilitate sites where they carry out their mining works. The Geological and
Mining Act, as well as implementing regulations thereto, obligate mining companies to make
contributions to the mine liquidation fund constituting 10% of a maintenance fee. Such funds may be
used only to cover costs of mine liquidation, including rehabilitation costs. It may happen that funds
and reserves of mining companies allocated to such a purpose will not cover actual rehabilitation
expenses that the companies will have to bear in future. This may result in a need to increase
amounts payable to the rehabilitation fund, create other reserves, and finance site rehabilitation

from external sources.
HIE CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012

V

4.3.3. Risk connected with weather conditions

Weather conditions influence technical and economic conditions of energy and heat generation and
distribution and create seasonable demand for energy. Such factors may cause limitations to energy
generation, mainly as a result of water in basins that is used for cooling the generating units getting
too hot or too low, as well as limitations to transmission capacities of the system. In addition, bad
weather conditions, including in particular the force of wind in the case of wind farms and water
surface in the case of water power plants, have a significant impact on energy production from
renewable sources. While, large rains cause problems with the dehydration of opencast lignite
mines. Extreme weather conditions break lines or damage electrical and power devices very often,
which results in breaks of and limitations to power supply. It must be added that all the above
phenomena are mostly unpredictable and in consequence may cause lowering of PGE Group income
and claims by the off-takers for compensations or for discounts. Removal of damages in the grid is

also connected with additional expenses relating to reconstruction of the damaged elements.

4.3.4. Risk relating to maintenance, repairs, modernisations and investments

PGE Group companies’ activity in lignite mining and energy generation and distribution requires
regular maintenance, repairs and modernization of assets. Such actions should ensure that
equipment’s life is optimum and guarantee necessary availability of key assets, including cost
minimisation. Assets recovery and modernisation investments, as well as investments in new assets,
are subject to substantial expenditure. A timely execution of the projects is vital for their
profitability. Delays caused by lengthy procedures relating to the acquisition of administrative
decisions and possible complaints being filed against them brings a risk of discontinuation of
individual investment projects. At the same time, particular stages of works or of new investments
may be delayed, for example, by uncertainty relating to the acquisition of sufficient financial
resources, difficulties in the acquisition of necessary permits, obstructions in acquirement of land for
new investments, protests of environmental organisations, strikes of employees, growth of projected
investment costs, limited supply of investment goods and machinery, delays caused by contractors,
bankruptcy of contractors or sub-contractors, accidents, unfavourable weather conditions or other
unexpected difficulties. Above mentioned circumstances may have significant adverse effect on

activity, results, financial standing of the Group or Group’s development perspectives.

4.3.5. Risk of unsettled legal status of the real estates

In the case of many properties owned by the PGE Group, in particular those used by distribution

system operator, there are doubts as to the legal title to use the properties. Very frequently,
1 IE CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012

V

investments, mainly ones related to lines, were carried out in third party properties without express
consent of owners. Corresponding national legal regulations are not clear and judicature on cases
relating to such situations has been changed in recent years. This situation is connected with a risk of
claims to be filed against PGE Group companies, like in the case of distribution system operator. We
may not exclude further cases of this type and related additional costs or even a need to stop using

certain properties.

4.3.6. Risk relating to obtaining and cost of external financing (downgrade or
withdrawal of the rating of PGE)

A part of the Group’s activities is financed from external sources (bank loans, bonds, etc.). PGE S.A.
and Group companies are parties to many financial agreements of the complex legal structure. It is
possible that in future it will be difficult to obtain new finance at an amount and terms desired by the
Group. This may be caused by still unstable situation in the financial and capital markets in Poland
and abroad, poor general economic situation in Poland and abroad, or other reasons that are
unpredictable now. Such circumstances may negatively affect the terms of financing, in particular
may lead to the growth of costs of such financing (higher interest rates, commissions, etc.). Higher

costs of financing may affect the Group’s results.

PGE S.A. has received positive evaluations from rating agencies confirming its high reliability
connected with investment in its debt securities. Nonetheless, rating agencies may at any time
downgrade or inform PGE S.A. of their intention to downgrade the rating. The rating agencies may
also completely withdraw their ratings which may have the same consequences as a downgrade in
PGE’s ratings. Any decrease in PGE’s rating may increase the costs of external financing, limit access
to capital markets and adversely affect the capacity of PGE Group companies to sell their products or
contract economic transaction, especially long-term ones. This may in turn decrease the liquidity of

PGE S.A. and adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of PGE Group.

4.3.7. Risk associated with the decisions of the President of the Energy
Regulatory Office regarding the implementation of LTC Act

The provisions of the LTC Act defining, in particular, terms for the calculation, payment and
adjustments of funds to cover stranded costs, calculation and payment of such funds to generators
coming within capital groups (including PGE Capital Group), tax consequences of LTC termination and
fund payment, as well as other issues, are complicated and there is no defined practice for their

application in Poland. Producers that terminated LTC and are authorised to receive funds to cover
1 IE CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012

|

PGE

stranded costs, including PGE Group generation companies, are exposed to risk of returning of

received funds in the case of the negative (annual or final) correction of stranded costs.

4.3.8. Risk of transfer prices

The Company and its subsidiaries have concluded, and continue to conclude, many transactions with
the other PGE Group members. These transactions specifically relate to the sale of fuels, electricity,
emission allowances, certificates of origin and certain services. Even though the Company and the
Group companies carefully follow the arm’s length principle in dealings with related parties, and
even though they are implementing unified standards regarding the compiling of documentation and
procedures in this regard, we cannot preclude potential disputes with the tax authorities in this

regard.

4.3.9. Risk of insufficient insurance protection

The activity of the PGE Capital Group is exposed to a number of risks connected with natural
calamities, breakdowns and damages. The Group’s business activity is also connected with third
party liability towards third persons for personal injuries, property damages or so called pure
financial loss. The Group maintains insurance policies covering only certain types of damages and
there is a risk of insufficient insurance coverage. In addition, there are risks that are not subject to
any insurance protection or in the case of which compensations, if any, are not likely to fulfil claims
or loss. Consequences of such events will be charged to costs of particular Group companies, what

may have a negative impact on their results.

4.3.10. Risk relating to court, arbitration and administrative proceedings and
employees’ claims

PGE S.A. and PGE Group companies are parties to court, arbitration or administrative proceedings

that are important for the Group’s activity. The Group takes up actions aiming at the settlement of

such cases in favour of PGE Group companies, but there is a risk that they will be resolved

unfavourably. There is also a risk that in future other proceedings will be initiated against PGE S.A.

and other PGE Group companies, which will be resolved unfavourably for us, which may have an

adverse impact on the Group’s activity and financial results.

Over 100 company and inter-company trade unions are present in the PGE S.A. and PGE Group
companies and approximately 25 thousand employees are members thereof. Pursuant to the current
provisions of law, trade unions influence the legislative process. They are also able to exert pressure

on employers in a number of ways, including in the form of collective labour disputes. PGE Group
MANAGEMENT BOARD'S REPORT ON AITHES i IE CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012

“DCE

companies are parties to a number of corporate and sector collective bargaining agreements.
Furthermore, management boards of many Group companies have entered into social agreements
with trade unions which confer considerable power upon employees and trade unions. The necessity
to consult or co-ordinate certain actions with the trade unions may delay, or even render impossible,
such actions and may lead to collective disputes, involving strikes or other labour protests.
Furthermore, should any significant redundancy program be required in the PGE Group in the future,
the obligation to make high severance payments to employees may delay or limit our ability to carry

out such redundancy program or may increase its cost.

Risks relating to court, arbitration and administrative proceedings and employees’ claim that are

essential for the Group’s activity are described in Note 38.4 to the consolidated financial statements.

4.3.11. Risk of asset impairment

As a result of falling energy prices, which according to forecasts, will remain low in the long term,
impairment losses with respect to generation assets of the Group may need to be recognised. This
risk materialised in case of Elektrownia Dolna Odra, where in 2012 impairment losses of tangible

assets were recognised and are described in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.

5. Other significant events of the reporting period and

su bsequent events

Other significant events of the reporting period and the significant event having impact on
the Group’s activities, that occurred after the end of the reporting period until the date of
approval of the financial statements, are described below (additionally see Note 45 to the

consolidated financial statements).
5.1. Consolidation Programme

On January 2, 2012 the merger of PGE Energia Odnawialna S.A. with Elektrownia Wiatrowa Kamiensk

sp. z 0.0. and Dychowskie Przedsiebiorstwo Eksploatacji Elektrowni ,,Eldeks” sp. z 0.0. was registered.

On March 12, 2012 District Court for todz Srédmiescie in t6dz, XX Commercial Division of National
Registry Court issued a decision on entry of merger of PGE Gornictwo i Energetyka Konwencjonalna

S.A. with PGE Elektrownia Opole S.A.

The above mentioned changes are a continuation of the Consolidation Programme, which has been
carried out in PGE Capital Group. As a result of the execution of the Consolidation Programme, the
following formal and legal mergers took place in the given segments in 2010: (i) mining and
conventional generation; (ii) renewable energy; (iii) distribution of electricity; (iv) retail sale of
electricity; as well as the merger of PGE Gornictwo i Energetyka S.A., PGE Energia S.A. and PGE
Electra S.A. with PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A.

Legal aspects of the Consolidation Programme

As a result of implementation of the Consolidation Programme, on August 3 and August 16, 2010 the
extraordinary general meetings of the involved PGE Group entities, adopted resolutions concerning
the mergers (merger resolutions). Few shareholders brought actions for statement of invalidity of
the resolution together with the request for overruling of the merger resolutions. The lawsuits
related to the merger resolution of PGE Elektrownia Opole S.A. and some merger resolutions within
Conventional Generation segment (cases conducted by PGE Gornictwo i Energetyka Konwencjonalna
S.A.) and merger resolution adopted by the shareholders of PGE Gérnictwo i Energetyka S.A. (case
conducted by PGE S.A.).

So far, in all lawfully concluded trials, the Courts dismissed in full the plaintiffs’ appeals, confirming
the viewpoint of the PGE companies that the shareholders’ objections are apparent and the

shareholders aim at contesting the exchange parity of shares, what is unallowable under appeal
He CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012

“DCE

against the resolutions. The shareholders used their proceeding rights and filed cassation appeals in
cases against PGE Gornictwo i Energetyka Konwencjonalna S.A., PGE Elektrownia Opole S.A. and PGE

Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A.

The Supreme Court refused to accept the cassation appeals for examination or dismissed the

plaintiff's cassation appeals.

In the last case for statement of invalidity of the merger resolution (eventually overruling), pending
before the court of second instance, the court dismissed the plaintiff's appeal. There is a risk of a

cassation appeal with the Supreme Court.

Irrespective of appeals of merger resolutions, there were also appeals against the verdict on entry to
National Court Register of the merger of PGE Gornictwo i Energetyka Konwencjonalna S.A. with the
acquired companies within the Conventional Generation segment and against the verdict on entry to
National Court Register of the merger of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. with the acquired
companies. Ultimately the Appeal Court dismissed the appeals, and the entries of mergers became

final and valid.

In the period from September to December 2012, petitions to call for a pre-trial settlement were
filed with the District Court for Warsaw Srédmiescie pursuant to which PGE Polska Grupa
Energetyczna S.A. has been requested to pay a compensation in the total amount of approx.
PLN 5.5 million. The petitioners, who are former shareholders of PGE Gornictwo i Energetyka S.A.
with its registered office in tddz, base their claim on the understatement of the share exchange ratio
when the shares of the acquired company, i.e. PGE Gornictwo i Energetyka S.A., had been exchanged

for the shares of the acquiring company, i.e. PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A.

In the period from August to October 2012, similar petitions were filed with the District Court in
Betchatow. The petitioners called PGE Gdornictwo i Energetyka Konwencjonalna S.A. in Betchatow for
a pre-trial settlement by the payment of a compensation to their benefit in a total amount of more
than PLN 24 million. The petitioners are former shareholders of PGE Elektrownia Opole S.A.
Compensation claims presented in the petitions are based on the right to report reservations
regarding the understatement of the share exchange ratio when the shares of the acquired
company, i.e. PGE Elektrownia Opole S.A., had been exchanged for the shares of the acquiring
company, i.e. PGE Gérnictwo i Energetyka Konwencjonalna S.A. In the petitioners’ view, the adopted

share exchange ratio had been understated.

By the date of this report, no amicable settlement has been reached in any of the above mentioned

cases. PGE S.A. finds the claims groundless, however further claims cannot be ruled out.

5.2. Concept of non-core asset management within the PGE Capital Group

In 2012, the PGE Capital Group took further actions under the “Concept of Non-Core Asset
Management within the PGE Capital Group”. The aim of the programme is to ensure transparent
separation of core business activities from other activities as well as disposal and restructuring of

non-core assets.

In the year 2012, shares in 5 companies were sold (including Megamed), 6 other non-core assets
were sold (flats and land property), 4 holiday centres were sold and the decommissioning process of

one holiday centre was completed.

As part of the Non-Core Project in the years 2009 - 2012 71 non-core assets were sold in total: all
share packages in 35 non-core companies were sold, liquidation or bankruptcy processes were
completed for 12 companies, shares in 1 company were redeemed, 23 other non-core assets were

sold.

In December 2012, intensive efforts were undertaken to launch the WEKTOR Project, which in 2013
replaced the Non-Core Project and covered all subsidiaries and companies with a minority share in
the PGE Capital Group. The primary objective of the WEKTOR Project is to further improve the
performance of the PGE Capital Group by:

x building-up synergy at the Capital Group level,

x focusing on core business activities with a strong Corporate Centre,

X supporting the process management model of the Capital Group through function modelling,
x increased flexibility of implemented management processes,

x reduction of operating expenses,

x increasing returns on assets,

x enhancing competitiveness of the PGE Capital Group.

At the same time, actions will be taken in view of preparing the disposal of other non-generation
areas and non-separated assets which are not intended for use as part of core business activities of

the companies operating in the PGE Capital Group.
5.3. Restructuring of Poland-Sweden DC line

At the end of 2010 some changes to the EU law were implemented, including Third Party Access,

what resulted in concluding of Market Coupling Agreement in December 2010 between PSE S.A.,
TH IE CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012

“DCE

Svenska Kraftnat (SvK), SwePol Link AB (SPL), SwePol Link Poland (SPP), Nordpool and TGE. The
agreement formally released transmission capacities. Market coupling implementation on SwePol
Link connection, business conditions of its operation, regulatory as well as operating (significant
limitation of transmission capacities) triggered the necessity of the ownership restructuring. In
December 2011 the shareholders of SwePol Link AB, i.e. PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. (49%),
Svenska Kraftnat (51%) and Vattenfall (which had liabilities toward SwePol Link), signed a Letter of

Intent which included declaration of will to restructure the DC line Poland-Sweden.

Restructuring consisted in sale of assets and acquisition of line assets by the Polish and Swedish

transmission operators.

From the formal point of view, the SwePol Link AB company was owned by only two entities, but due
to past complex legal and business relationships of the parties involved, a few stakeholders
(Stakeholders Group) of the project took part in the whole process of restructuring and negotiations.
Apart from PGE S.A. and SvK, SPL and SPP they were: PSE S.A., Vattenfall AB and the Swedish and
Polish regulators. The main task of the Stakeholders Group was to agree on a target model for the
connection of SwePol Link (in general) and making detailed arrangements concerning the road map,
including necessary ownership transformations (formal and financial matters in particular), and also

conditions for Vattenfall AB to withdraw from the business relationship with SwePol.

As a result of discussions and meetings of Stakeholders, which began in 2010, the final concept for
the restructuring of the project as well as the process of effecting the transaction itself was reached
in 2012. As a consequence, PGE S.A. took a strategic decision to start to implement the scenario
involving the sale of the property owned by the SwePol Link AB company to the Polish and Swedish
transmission system operators — PSE S.A. and Svenska Kraftnat respectively (in practice, the only
possible purchasers of the asset and expressed a strategic consent to liquidate the SwePol Link AB

and Swepol Link Poland companies.

From the perspective of PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A., the key issue in the SwePol
restructuring was the return by Vattenfall of advances for transmission charges to PGE S.A. Since the
beginning of the restructuring, Vattenfall has questioned the above claim raised by PGE S.A.
Following negotiations, Vattenfall finally acknowledged the PGE S.A. position and the advances for

transmission charges were returned under an agreement signed between Vattenfall and PGE S.A.

On August 31, 2012, on the ground of agreements concluded on August 23, 2012 between PSE S.A.,
Svenska Kraftnat, SwePol Link AB, SwePol Link Poland, PGE and Vattenfall, SwePol AB and SwePol

Poland sp. z 0.0. sold their assets to Polish operator PSE S.A. and Swedish operator Svenska Kraftnat.

As a result of this transaction PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. received refund of the
prepayments for transmission fees in amount of SEK 413.6 million (PLN 206 million). This transaction

allowed PGE S.A. to withdraw from the activity, which has not been profitable any more.

The consequence of the sale of assets will be liquidation of SwePol Link Poland and SwePol Link AB.
The Extraordinary Assembly of Partners of SwePol Link AB decided to dissolve and liquidate the
company. The Assembly of Partners also adopted a resolution on approval of Directors’ Board

proposal on liquidation of a subsidiary, i.e. SwePol Link Poland sp. z. 0.0.

Since March 2012, a programme aiming at improving the organisational performance of all activities
in the Capital Group has been developed; it based on process-oriented management. After the
implementation of the Operating Model, which began in March 2013, the Efficiency Improvement
Programme focusing on the reduction of specific costs will be replaced by optimisation programmes
covering the activities of individual segments, concerns and all branches belonging to them. The
programme is process-oriented and therefore will consistently lead to permanent changes and

improved competitiveness throughout the Group.

Due to employment restructuring initiatives, the employment in Conventional Generation,
Distribution and Retail sale in 2012 was reduced by almost 3 thousand persons (including 2,050 from

Voluntary Leave Programs).

On July 31, 2012 the ERO President issued decisions on the annual adjustment of the stranded costs
and annual adjustment of the costs generated in gas-fired units for the year 2011. The decisions
were unfavourable for PGE GiEK S.A. and in the opinion of the PGE Group were not in line with the
LTC Act (according to the decision of the ERO President, the total value of the annual adjustment of
the stranded costs and annual adjustment of the costs generated in gas-fired units for the year 2011
amount to PLN (-) 536.5 million). On August 16, 2012 PGE GiEK S.A. appealed against the above
decision to the CCCP. As a result of the appeal, the ERO President agreed with the Group’s
standpoint and on September 21, 2012 issued decisions, which changed the previous decisions on
the amount of the stranded costs to PLN (-) 83.8 million. The value of the above adjustment is
indisputable. With regard to the annual adjustments of the costs generated in gas-fired units for the
year 2011 the ERO President did not agree with the appeal of the company and as a result they

submitted the appeal to the CCCP. The claim value amounts to PLN 5.8 million.

The details of the LTC compensations and their impact on the results achieved by the Group are

presented in Note 45.1 to the consolidated financial statements.
5.10. Dispute between PGE S.A. and ATEL (currently Alpiq)

Since 2009 PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. was a party to arbitration proceedings with the
company Alpiq. The proceeding was held before the Arbitration Tribunal in Vienna. The subject of
the arbitration proceeding was the claim of Alpiq, raised against PGE, resulting from the default on a
electricity supply agreement signed on 28 October 1997. Initially claims submitted by Alpiq
amounted to EUR 72 million. At the further stage of proceedings, along with the exchange of
pleadings, the compensation claim amount increased to EUR 155 million plus interest due. After
exchange of post-hearing briefs the claim was finally set at EUR 168 million plus interest due. The
arbitration proceeding was held in written form and was based on the exchange of pleadings
between the parties and presentation to the Tribunal of evidence by witnesses, experts and

statements by the parties.

On September 12, 2012, the Arbitration Tribunal issued a final judgment in this case and obliged PGE
to pay to Alpiq an amount of EUR 43,203,986.60 plus interest due in amount of EUR 4,054,923,55.
Aggregate value of the liability accounts for EUR 47,258,910.15. At the same time, the Tribunal
awarded PGE S.A. with amount of EUR 1,462,622.23 as the reimbursement of arbitration proceeding
costs from Alpiq. The ultimate amount that PGE S.A. is obliged to pay to Alpiq, after deducting the
arbitration proceeding costs, amounts to EUR 45,796,287.92. With account taken to the Alpiq claim

(EUR 168 million plus interest due) and unpredictability of the verdict by the Austrian Arbitration
He CAPITAL GROUP OF PGE POLSKA GRUPA ENERGETYCZNA S.A. FOR THE YEAR 2012
ae

“DCE

Tribunal, the above should be treated as a Company’s success. It should be emphasized that
arbitrators in complex cases, often issue verdicts based on general rules of fairness, i.e. judging half

of the amount in plaintiff’s favour. Meanwhile PGE S.A. won this dispute in more than 70%.

At the early stage of proceeding, on the basis of available information and to the best of its
knowledge, PGE S.A. made a estimation of claims which were likely to be reasonably considered
justified by the Arbitration Tribunal. The Company established a provision for the claim thus

estimated, in the amount exceeding EUR 94 million as at August 31, 2012.

After the verdict issue date and receipt date of the verdict the Company reversed the surplus of
provisions created. As at December 31, 2012 the Company recognizes in the provisions line above

amount plus remuneration of a law firm that acted as a proxy in the proceeding.

Currently PGE and Alpiq are discussing the definitive method of fulfilment of the Tribunal’s verdict.

Furthermore, issues related to support schemes for certain technological processes, i.e. cogeneration
or biomass co-combustion have not been resolved in 2012. Such market conditions and lack of
coherent, system-related regulatory solutions causes the substantial growth of risk related to

investments in system generation assets.

The conditions described above and their anticipated long-term character were reflected in actions
undertaken in 2012 by the Management Board of PGE S.A. with a view to adapt the Group to volatile
external conditions, by inter alia updating the strategy of the PGE Capital Group, designing an
operating model for the PGE Capital Group, optimisation of the investment portfolio and

comprehensive approach to cost optimisation.
