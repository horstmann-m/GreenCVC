Operational key figures
Quarterly financial information

2016 was a challenging year in many respects. The beginning of the
year was characterised by increased commodity market volatility;
especially coal and oil prices were very low. Nordic water reservoirs
were clearly above the long-term average, creating pressure on
electricity prices, and the British EU exit vote also created uncertainty.
Late in the year, however, some positive signs were seen on the power
market, mainly driven by improved commodity and emission prices,
although the overall business environment still continued to be
demanding. Although some European economies have started to
recover, the industry's power demand is still too weak and commodity
prices are too low and volatile to support a material increase in
electricity prices.

A positive development in 2016 was the Swedish government’s
budget proposal in September; it included the timetable for
lowering the real-estate tax on hydro assets and for phasing out the
nuclear capacity tax over the coming years. We are pleased with
the swift decision and the finalisation ofa timetable, which gives
regulatory stability to operate the plants and plan the necessary
safety investments. This is completely in line with what we have
been advocating for, a regulation and taxation policy where the
different forms of production are treated more equally.

Operationally, the year met our expectations, as availability in
our plants was good and ongoing projects progressed as planned.
We completed our extensive investment programme in Russia in
the spring 2016, and the new capacity has been the key driver for the
earnings growth in the Russia division.

In February, we published the key high-level elements in
our strategy. We also adjusted our operational model to better
enable strategy implementation. During the year we screened
opportunities in line with our strategy. The acquisition of the
Polish electricity and gas sales company DUON, wind power
investments in Sweden, Norway and Russia, and the acquisition
of Ekokem, a leading Nordic circular economy company, are
important steps in the implementation of our strategy and give us
access to new revenue streams independent of the Nordic power

price. In addition, as we are continuously looking to optimise our
production fleet, we divested the Tobolsk power plant in Russia.

We updated our vision and mission in the autumn. Our vision
and mission go beyond just clean energy production, they express
our commitment to fuel and resource efficiency and how we enable
our stakeholders, customers and society to make sustainable
choices. Our updated vision — ‘For a cleaner world’ reflects our
ambition to drive the transformation towards an low-emission
energy system and optimal resource efficiency. Our role is to
accelerate this change by reshaping the energy system, improving
resource efficiency and providing smart solutions.

We expect the energy sector transformation to accelerate in
the future. At the same time as we lower the cost and improve the
productivity of our existing operations, we will focus on additional
organic and M&A growth opportunities. We have two phases in
our capital redeployment. Priority one in phase one is generation
consolidation in Europe — consolidation of assets and businesses
within our core competence and giving us direct access to cash
flows. Priority two in phase one is to take the competencies that we
have today in our combined heat and power production and in the
acquired Ekokem business, and widen the City Solution’s scope.
The overall goal of phase one is to maximize our cash flow to enable
both a competitive dividend and “phase two” investments into
the future energy system. Phase two involves growing in solar and
wind, and new internal or external energy ventures to take care of
our long-term competitiveness.

Fortum’s vision, strategic cornerstones

and updated financial targets

In February 2016, Fortum launched its new vision, strategic

cornerstones and updated financial targets. The new vision and

strategy target growth and continued profitability with a strong

focus on clean energy, customers and shareholder value creation.
The long-term financial target for return on capital employed

(ROCE) was revised to at least 10%, while the target for comparable

net debt to EBITDA, around 2.5 times, remained unchanged. The

dividend policy also remained unchanged.

Fortum share and shareholders

Fortum’s strategy has four cornerstones: (1) enhance
productivity of the current fleet and drive industry transformation,
(2) create sustainable solutions for growing cities and urban areas,
(3) increase investments in solar and wind power, and (4) build new
energy ventures.

At Fortum’s Capital Market Day in November 2016, the strategy
execution plan was expanded in more depth. The redeployment of
cash and the execution of Fortum’s strategy will take place in two
phases, anda significant part of the redeployment is targeted to
take place during 2017.

Phase 1: The goal for the first phase is to maximise cash flow
through capital redeployment. The priority is consolidation of
the generation business in Europe. After this, and subject to the
remaining financial headroom, also further organic growth and/
or acquisition-based growth of City Solutions will be considered,
mainly in Europe. The resulting cash flow will be used for two
purposes: 1) implementing Fortum’s dividend policy; and
2) investments into Phase 2 as described below. In addition,
Fortum will continue its cost and asset portfolio optimisation in all
divisions, informing the market about these as they advance.

Phase 2: The goal for the second phase is to secure Fortum’s
longer-term competitiveness. This has already started through
wind investments in our Nordic and Russian home markets and
through solar investments in India. The next steps will include
solar-enabled system solutions, maximising the added value from
waste and biomass as well as minimising fossil emissions. In
addition, phase 2 will also include new digital services, services for
active consumers, electric traffic, new storage solutions, and other
potentially disruptive innovations.

Fortum also updated its vision and mission to cover a broader
scope. “Fora cleaner world” reflects the company’s mission “We
engage our customers and society to drive the change towards a
cleaner world. Our role is to accelerate this change by reshaping the
energy system, improving resource efficiency and providing smart
solutions. In this way we deliver excellent shareholder value.”

Quarterly financial information

Reorganisation of operations

Fortum reorganised its operating structure in April 2016. The
target of the new organisation is to enable the implementation

of the company’s new vision and strategy. The new organisation
consists of three business divisions: Generation, City Solutions and
Russia. In addition, two development units focusing on growing
new businesses were established: (1) M&A and Solar & Wind
Development, and (2) Technology and New Ventures.

The changes to Fortum’s segment reporting were minor. The
company continues to have four segments. The segments as of the
second quarter of 2016 are: Generation (mainly the former Power
and Technology); City Solutions (mainly the former Heat, Electricity
Sales and Solutions); Russia; and Other, under which M&A, Solar
& Wind Development, and Technology and New Ventures, as
well as corporate functions are reported. Some businesses were
repositioned due to the reorganisation, but because of the minor
financial impact, the comparable segment information for 2015 has
not been restated.

Following the divestment of the Swedish distribution business,
Fortum no longer has electricity distribution operations. The
Distribution segment was reclassified as discontinued operations
as of the first quarter of 2015.

h GAAP requirement

for financial derivatives

Anew requirement issued by Finnish Accounting Board
relating to accounting for financial derivatives was published

13 December 2016. The requirements have to be applied in 2016
separate financial statements for Finnish companies. Based on
this requirement Fortum has chosen to apply IFRS principles for
accounting financial derivatives in Fortum Oyj and its Finnish
subsidiaries.

Applying IFRS principles means that financial derivatives are
fair valued at each balance sheet date, which may create volatility
in income statement and equity. The changes due to the new
requirement has no effect to Fortum Group, but had a minor effect
to net profit and equity of Fortum Oyj in 2016.

Comparability of information

presented in tables and graphs

Fortum has restated the financial information in prior years as

follows:

+ Distribution segment is treated as discontinued operations in
2015. The comparative period information for 2014 was restated
accordingly, but information in the tables and graphs presented
for year 2013 or earlier is not restated due to reclassification of
discontinued operations. Financial results discussed in this
operating and financial review are for the continuing operations
of Fortum Group. See additional information in } Note 14
Discontinued operations.

+ Furthermore, information in the tables and graphs presented
for year 2012 or earlier is not restated due to the adoption
of IFRS 10 and IFRS 11. Adoption of standards influences
treatment of Fortum’s holding in AB Fortum Varme samagt med
Stockholms stad in the consolidated financial statements.

In addition, as of 2014, presented figures have been rounded and

consequently the sum of individual figures may deviate from the

sum presented. Figures in brackets refer to the comparison period

sales gains, Ekokem transaction costs, updated provisions and an
IFRS accounting treatment (IAS 39) of derivatives mainly used for
hedging Fortum’s power production, as well as nuclear fund
adjustments for continuing operations, amounting to EUR -11

decision on the early closure of two nuclear units in Sweden, which
impacted the share of profit from associates by EUR -116
million (> Note 7). In addition, Fortum Varme's share of profit in
2015 was lower mainly due to the paid compensation for refinancing

Market conditions

Nordic countries
According to preliminary statistics, electricity consumption in the
Nordic countries increased in 2016 by 9 TWh to 390 (381) TWh,
mainly due to closer-to-long-term average temperature compared
to the warmer year in 2015, although modest demand growth was
seen in the Nordic countries.

At the beginning of 2016, the Nordic water reservoirs were
at 98 TWh, which is 15 TWh above the long-term average and
18 TWh higher than a year earlier. By the end of the year, reservoirs
were 8 TWh below the long-term average and 23 TWh lower than
at the end of 2015. Reservoir levels have decreased due to low
precipitation in the Nordic area and high hydro production mainly
in Norway during 2016.

In 2016, the Nord Pool average system spot price was EUR 26.9
(21.0) per MWh, with the area price in Finland at EUR 32.4 (29.7) per

MWh and in Sweden SE3 (Stockholm) at EUR 29.2 (22.0) per MWh.
Nordic reservoirs turned from a 15 TWh surplus to an 8 TWh deficit
during the year. 2016 was again warmer than normal, but less so
than in 2015.

In Germany, the average spot price in 2016 was EUR 29.0
(31.6) per MWh.

The market price of CO: emission allowances (EUA) was EUR 8.1
per tonne at the beginning of the year. Throughout most of the
fourth quarter and the whole calendar year the price fluctuated
between EUR 4 and 6 per tonne and ended at EUR 6.5 per tonne at
the end of 2016.

Russia

Fortum operates both in the Tyumen and Khanty-Mansiysk area

of Western Siberia, where industrial production is dominated by
the oil and gas industries, and in the Chelyabinsk area of the Urals,
which is dominated by the metal industry.

According to preliminary statistics, Russian electricity
consumption was 1,027 (1,007) TWh and the corresponding figure
in Fortum’s operating area in the First price zone (European and
Urals part of Russia) was 787 (772) TWh in 2016.

In 2016, the average electricity spot price, excluding capacity
price, increased by 4.3% to RUB 1,204 (1,154) per MWh in the First

Carbon pricing and emissions trading

The ratification of the global climate agreement adopted in

Paris 2015, entered into force in November 2016. Preparation of
implementation rules will take a couple of years, and the impact

on the energy industry will become concrete only via legislation

in different countries. The EU ratified the Agreement, but Russia’s
ratification is not expected before 2020. Carbon pricing schemes
are being planned in several countries. The start of the Chinese ETS
in 2017 is expected to double the coverage of emissions subject to
carbon pricing globally.

The EU Commission released an announcement on the
implications of the Paris Agreement for the EU climate policy. The
EU decided not to revise its climate target for 2030. Basically all EU
climate regulation to implement the 2030 target was under review
in 2016. The revision of the emissions trading directive (ETS) was
under discussion in the Parliament and the Council, but adoption
isn’t expected until late 2017 at the earliest or in 2018. Fortum
and the electricity industry as a whole have highlighted the need
to increase the ETS ambition and strengthen the market stability
reserve mechanism.

Progress in implementation of the Energy Union

Year 2016 was the EU Energy Union's “year of delivery” with the
release of three major legislative packages. The in early 2016
released “winter package” focused on security of supply and on
heating and cooling (H&C). The new EU H&C strategy underlined
the importance of decarbonisation of heating and cooling and the
improvement of energy efficiency in the residential sector. The
“summer package” contained a proposal for sharing the burden
in the non-ETS sectors, i.e. binding national targets for member
states to cut CO, emissions in transport, buildings, agriculture and
waste management in 2021-2030. The strategy has a strong focus
on electrification of the transport sector while also recognising

the role of biofuels. A broader “winter package” (Clean Energy for
all Europeans) released in late 2016 completed to a large extent
the legislative work in the field of energy. The winter package
includes a renewal of the internal electricity market legislation, as
well as energy efficiency and renewable energy directives with the
intention to implement the related EU 2030 targets.

Swedish energy policy and taxation

The focus of the energy policy in 2016 was on the parliamentary
energy commission’s work with the aim of developing a long-
term energy policy for the period after 2030. In June, a broad
parliamentary agreement for long-term Swedish energy policy
was presented by the government and parts of the opposition. The
agreement aims at a 100% renewable energy system by 2040, but
with no actual limits regarding nuclear generation. The electricity
certificate system will be prolonged providing for an additional

18 TWh of electricity from renewable energy sources during
2020-2030. The progress of the energy agreement will be followed-
up every second year starting in 2018.

One of the key elements of the parliamentary agreement was
the proposal that taxation of different energy production forms
should be more equal, and that the tax burden of nuclear and hydro
should be taken to the level of other production technologies. The
tax on installed nuclear capacity will be reduced starting in July
2017 and totally abolished as of 2018. The regulatory framework
for investment of the nuclear waste funds’ assets is suggested to
be expanded to provide for a better long-term yield. The real-estate
tax rate on hydro assets will be reduced from current 2.8% to the
regular tax rate of 0.5% on real estate in four steps by 2020. In
addition, a proposal for new hydro legislation is being prepared and
is expected to be handed over to the parliament in autumn 2017.

Finnish energy policy and taxation

In late 2016 the Finnish Government published its energy and
climate strategy in order to implement both the national energy and
climate policy objectives of the Government's strategic programme,
as well as the EU 2030 energy and climate targets. The key elements
are: increase the share of renewable energy to a minimum of 50%
with a strong focus on bioenergy, launch ofa limited support
scheme for renewable electricity (2 TWh of electricity production is
auctioned, based on technology neutral tendering, in 2018-2020),
30% biofuel blending obligation and some incentives for electric
vehicles as well as a ban on the use of coal in energy production

by 2030.

In addition, the Finnish Government decided to increase the tax
on heating fuels from 2017 onwards. However, CHP continues to
pay only 50% of the CO, tax component, while the original aim was
to increase it to 100%. The agreed tax model increases the tax on
both the CO, and the energy content components. The Government
also decided to make an assessment during 2017 concerning the
possibility to apply real estate tax rates applicable to power plants
also to wind power. Currently windmills below 3 MW are in the
scope of lower tax rates. The earlier announced mechanism to
offset the indirect costs of the EU Emissions Trading System for
energy intensive industries was also approved.

Segment reviews
Generation
Generation is responsible for Nordic power production. The segment comprises

1) The Nordic power sales income and volume includes hydro and nuclear
generation, excluding minorities. It does not include thermal generation, minorities,
customer business or other purchases.

2) Power plants are often built jointly with other power producers, and owners
purchase electricity at cost including interest cost and production taxes. The share
of profit/loss is mainly IFRS adjustments (e.g. accounting for nuclear-related assets
and liabilities) and depreciations on fair-value adjustments from historical
acquisitions (> Note 20).

In 2016, the Generation segment’s comparable EBITDA was EUR
527 (680) million. Comparable operating profit was EUR 417 (561)
million. The decline was mainly due to the lower achieved power
price and lower hydro volumes. The decline was partly offset by
higher nuclear volumes and lower fixed costs.

Operating profit of EUR 338 (-396) million was affected by
sales gains, the IFRS accounting treatment (IAS 39) of derivatives,
mainly used for hedging Fortum’s power production, and by
nuclear fund adjustments, amounting to EUR -79 (-958)
million (} Note 5 and > Note 6). Year 2015 included EUR -794
million from the decision on the early closure of two nuclear units
in Sweden (> Note 5 and> Note 7).

2016. Ekokem has been integrated as a business area into the City
Solutions division and has been consolidated into Fortum Group
from the end of August 2016.

In 2016, sales increased to EUR 1,424 (1,187) million, mainly
due to the consolidation of DUON and Ekokem. Heat sales volumes

of the City Solutions segment amounted to 8.7 (7.8) TWh. Power
sales volumes from CHP production totalled 2.8 (2.5) TWh during
the same period.

Comparable EBITDA increased, and totalled EUR 238 (209)
million. Comparable operating profit was EUR 112 (108) million.
The main drivers for the improvement were the consolidations
of DUON and Ekokem. The full year result was burdened by an
unfavourable fuel mix and the lower achieved power price. In
addition, the use of more accurate consumption estimates had a
one-off, positive impact on electricity sales in 2015.

Operating profit of EUR 145 (105) million was affected mainly by
sales gains, Ekokem transaction costs and the IFRS accounting
treatment (IAS 39) of derivatives totalling EUR 33 (-3) million

After the completion of the multi-year investment programme in
March 2016, Fortum has 2,268 MW of new capacity i.e. generation
capacity built after 2007, which under the Russian Capacity Supply
Agreement (CSA — “new capacity”) receives guaranteed payments
for a period of 10 years after the commissioning of each new unit.
The received capacity payments vary depending on the age,
location, type and size of the plant, as well as on seasonality and
availability. The CSA payments can also vary somewhat annually,
as they are linked to Russian Government long-term bonds with 8
to 10 years' maturity. In early 2016, the System Administrator of the
wholesale market published data on the weighted average cost of
capital (WACC) and the consumer price index (CPI) for 2015, which
was used to calculate the capacity price on CSA in 2016. The CSA
payments were revised upwards accordingly to reflect the higher
bond rates. In addition, the regulator will review the guaranteed

CSA payments by re-examining earnings from the electricity-only
market three and six years after the commissioning ofa unit, and
may revise the CSA payments accordingly.

All of Fortum’s capacity generation built prior to 2008 (CCS —
“old capacity”), totalling 2,214 MW in December 2016, was allowed
to participate in the Competitive Capacity Selection for 2016,
and the majority of Fortum’s plants were selected. The volume of
Fortum’s installed capacity not selected in the auction totalled
175 MW, for which Fortum has obtained forced mode status, i.e. it
is receiving payments for the capacity.

In 2016, the Russia segment’s power sales volumes amounted
to 29.5 (29.4) TWh and heat sales volumes totalled 20.6 (25.4) TWh.
Electricity volumes increased mainly due to the commissioning
of two new units in Chelyabinsk. The divestment of the Tobolsk
CHP plant in February 2016 decreased the growth impact on both
electricity and heat volumes.

The Russia segment’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 312 (267)
million. Comparable operating profit was EUR 191 (201) million,
including CSA provision releases of EUR 2 (52) million. The
positive effect came from operationally good performance and high
utilisation rates in the power plants, the commissioning of new
units as well as from the higher received CSA payments following
the adjustments of the WACC component in the CSA prices. The
Russian rouble had a negative effect of EUR 13 million.

Operating profit was EUR 226 (203) million, including sales
gains of EUR 35 (1) million (» Note 5).

The share of profits from associated companies and joint
ventures totalled EUR 38 (32) million (> Note 20). The operating
profit (EBIT) for the whole Russia segment, which includes the
share of TGC-1, totalled RUB 19.5 billion in 2016, including a sales
gain RUB 2.6 billion on the sale of Tobolsk.

Fortum started receiving capacity payments under the Russian
Capacity Supply Agreement (CSA) for Chelyabinsk GRES unit 2 as of
1 March 2016. Fortum’s extensive investment programme in Russia
that started in 2008 was completed during 2016, as the final unit of
the programme started its commercial operation.

Through its interest in Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO), Fortum is
participating in the building of Olkiluoto 3 (OL3), a 1,600-MW
nuclear power plant unit in Finland. The plant’s start of commercial
electricity production is expected to take place in late 2018,
according to the plant supplier AREVA-Siemens Consortium. TVO
has withdrawn a EUR 300 million shareholder loan from the total
EUR 600 million commitments. Fortum’s share of the EUR 300

In February, Fortum agreed to sell its 51.4% shareholding in the
Estonian natural gas import, sales and distribution company AS
Eesti Gaas. Fortum finalised the transaction in March 2016.

In March, Fortum completed the acquisition of 93.35% of
the shares in the Polish electricity and gas sales company Grupa
DUON S.A. In April, Fortum announced that it had purchased the
remaining shares through a mandatory squeeze-out procedure,
after which the extraordinary meeting of shareholders of Grupa
DUON S.A. decided to delist the company from the Warsaw Stock
Exchange.

In May, Fortum signed an agreement with the four biggest
owners of Ekokem Corporation, representing approximately 81%
of the shares, to acquire their shareholding in the company for
approximately EUR 470 million. This corresponded to a debt-
and cash-free purchase price of approximately EUR 700 million
for 100% of the company, as Fortum made a tender offer to all
remaining shareholders at the same price (EUR 165 per share).
Fortum obtained the required competition clearances in July.
Having reached the necessary ownership thresholds, Fortum has
started a minority redemption process. At the end of 2016, Fortum’s
total ownership was approximately 98%.

In December, Fortum finalised the acquisition of 100% of
‘Turebergs Recycling AB's shares from Turebergs Akeri AB with an
enterprise value of up to approximately EUR 11 million. The main
business of Turebergs Recycling is environmental construction,
recycling and processing of bottom ash from waste-to-energy plants.

employees; City Solutions 2,314 (1,417); Russia 3,745 (4,126); and
Other 1,070 (951). Generation’s number of employees decreased,
mainly due to the reorganisation of the Group; City Solution’s
increased, mainly due to the acquisitions of DUON and Ekokem;
Russia's decreased, due to the divestment of Tobolsk, and Other
increased, due to the reorganisation of the Group. The headcount
has also increased in new business areas, such as M&A and Solar
& Wind Development, Technology and New Ventures as well
as Nuclear Services, while it has decreased in the power plant
operations and maintenance due to partnerships.

In addition, as Fortum revised its organisation during 2016 to
align with its new strategy the organisational change focused on
job rotation and giving opportunities to young talents to enable
them to gain demanding and visible positions.

In autumn 2016, the “Energise Your Day” wellbeing programme
was launched in Finland. The Energise Your Day wellbeing
programme encourages employees to maintain and improve their
overall wellbeing and offers ideas and tools for selfmanagement,
stress management, recovery, nutrition and physical activity.

The wellbeing programme started with a questionnaire and the
response rate was almost 80%. After completing the questionnaire,
the employees receive tailored suggestions on how to improve
their wellbeing; the programme also offers lectures and personal
counselling. The programme will be rolled out to other countries
in 2017.

Research and development innovative and sustainable carbon-neutral biorefining technologies Sustainability

Sustainability is at the core of Fortum’s strategy and, alongside
Fortum’s current businesses, the company is carefully exploring
and developing new sources of growth within renewable energy
production.

Fortum’s goal is to be at the forefront of energy technology
and application development. To accelerate innovation and the
commercialisation of new offerings, Fortum strengthens its in-
house innovation and digitalisation efforts and builds partnerships
with leading global suppliers, promising technology companies
and research institutions. Fortum makes direct and indirect
investments in start-ups with promising new innovations that
focus on connectivity, have disruptive potential and accelerate
the transition towards a circular economy. Fortum also invests
in technologies that support better utilisation of the current
asset base, and can create new markets and products for Fortum.
The company is continuously looking for emerging clean energy
solutions and for solutions that increase resource and system
efficiency.

During 2016, Fortum’s R&D focused on new urban, rural and
industrial business concept studies as well as on the sustainability,
quality and handling of mixed biofuels and biofuel availability.
Another very important area is how to increase energy system
flexibility throughout the energy value chain, from energy
production to consumers as well as customer solutions. As part of
this study Fortum developed a virtual power plant pilot in order to
optimise the system by using household water heaters as well as
household solar panels together with battery storage.

In nuclear R&D, a key objective is to enable growth of the
nuclear services business. In 2016, focus was also on future
nuclear technologies like Small Modular Reactors, and on further
development of the safety and efficiency of Fortum’s nuclear power
plants. Virtual Reality was developed for control room validation
and radiation safety training purposes. The NURES product for
purification of radioactive liquids was further developed to ensure
our competitiveness.

In 2016, Fortum also invested in a Finnish biorefining
technology company (Chempolis Oy) specialised in providing

for the biomass, energy, oil, paper, alcohol, sugar and chemical
industries. Fortum is a significant user of biomass in its own
operations, and it has promoted the importance of resource
efficiency in the use of biomass and common sustainability criteria
for biomass. The company believes that biomass could be used
more efficiently for creating higher value products. Fortum also
invested in the Swedish solar technology company, Exeger Sweden
AB (Publ). The company is specialised in developing and producing
novel printable solar cells for use in consumer electronics, on
buildings and in other applications.

The Group reports its R&D expenditure on a yearly basis. In
2016, Fortum’s R&D expenditure was EUR 52 (47) million, or 1.4%
(1.4%) of sales.

Fortum sustainability targets and performance

Reputation index, based on One Fortum Survey

Fortum strives for balanced management of economic, social
and environmental responsibility in the company’s operations.
Fortum’s sustainability targets consist both of Group-level key
indicators and division-level indicators.

The Group-level sustainability targets emphasise Fortum’s role
in society and measure not only environmental and safety targets,
but also Fortum’s reputation, customer satisfaction, employee
wellbeing, and the security of production of power and heat. At
the beginning of 2016, the Group-level target-setting was changed
by taking work wellbeing, measured as a percentage of sickness-
related absences, as a new Group target. In terms of specific carbon
dioxide emissions (gCO./kWh), Fortum focuses on measuring
Group-level specific emissions from total energy production.

The achievement of the sustainability targets is monitored
in monthly, quarterly and annual reporting. Sustainability
target-setting and follow-up, as well as the approval of Fortum’s
Sustainability Policy, and the review of Fortum’s Sustainability
Reporting, are included in the working order of the Board of
Directors. Complete data on Fortum’s sustainability performance is
published in Fortum’s Sustainability Report.

The company is listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki exchange
and is included in the STOXX Global ESG Leaders, OMX GES
Sustainability Finland, and ECPI” indices. Fortum is also ranked
in category A- and as the top Nordic company in the utilities sector
in the annual CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) rating
2016, and it has received a Prime Status (B-) rating by the German
oekom research AG.

In 2016, integration of Ekokem and Duon operations into
Fortum’s sustainability approach and data compilation systems
were started. Sustainability information relating to DUON’s
operations is included in sustainability reporting from 1 April 2016
and Ekokem’s operations from 1 September 2016.

Economic responsibility

For Fortum, economic responsibility means competitiveness,
performance excellence and market-driven production, which
create long-term value for our stakeholders and enable profitable
growth. Satisfied customers are key to Fortum’s success. Fortum.
aims to manage its supply chain in a responsible manner.

Fortum’s goal is to achieve excellent financial performance
in strategically selected core areas through strong competence
and responsible ways of operating. Fortum measures financial
performance with return on capital employed (target: 10%) and
capital structure (target: comparable net debt/EBITDA around
2.5). In addition, Fortum has used the applicable Global Reporting
Initiative (GRI) G4 indicators for reporting economic responsibility
as of 1 January 2014.

Targets for reputation and customer satisfaction are monitored
annually. Company reputation among the key stakeholders in the
One Fortum Survey in 2016 improved to 72.5 points (ona scale of
1-100 points) and exceeded the target of 72.0 points. The Group
target (70-74 points) for customer satisfaction was achieved in all
business areas except electricity sales for business customers.

Fortum expects its business partners to act responsibly and to
comply with the Fortum Code of Conduct and the Fortum Supplier
Code of Conduct. Fortum assesses the performance ofits business
partners with supplier qualification and supplier audits. In 2016,
Fortum audited 13 (9) suppliers in China, India, Russia, Poland,

Latvia, Lithuania and Finland. In September 2016, Fortum signed a
contract with an external service provider for conducting supplier
sustainability audits.

Fortum as a tax payer

Fortum supports social development and wellbeing of the areas of
operations by e.g. paying taxes. The tax benefits Fortum produces
to society include not only corporate income taxes borne EUR 48
(106) million but also several other taxes. In 2016, Fortum’s taxes
borne were EUR 365 (413) million. Taxes borne include corporate
income taxes, production taxes, employment taxes, taxes on
property and cost of indirect taxes. Production taxes include

also taxes paid through electricity purchased from associated
companies.

In addition, Fortum administers and collects different taxes on
behalf of governments and authorities. Such taxes include e.g. VAT,
excise taxes on power consumed by customers, payroll taxes and
withholding taxes. The amount of taxes collected by Fortum was
EUR 376 (352) million.

Environmental responsibility
Fortum’s aim is to provide its customers with environmentally
benign products and services. Circular economy, resource and
energy efficiency, and maximising the added value of waste and
biomass are key priorities in Fortum’s environmental approach.
In addition, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of
environmental impacts are emphasised in Fortum’s environmental
responsibility. The company’s know-how in CO»-free hydro and
nuclear power production and in energy-efficient combined heat
and power production, investments in solar and wind power, as
well as solutions for sustainable cities play a key role in this.
Fortum’s Group-level environmental targets are related to CO)
emissions, energy efficiency, and major environmental, health and
safety (EHS) incidents. At the end of 2016, 99.9% of Fortum’s power
and heat production worldwide had ISO 14001 certification.
Fortum’s climate target over the next five years is for total
specific CO, emissions from both electricity and heat production
in all countries to be below 200 g/kWh. The target is calculated

By 2020, Fortum’s target is to achieve energy savings of more than
1,400 GWh annually, compared to 2012. At the end of 2016, about
1,372 GWh had been achieved. Among the projects executed in
2016 were nuclear plant refurbishments in Finland, hydropower
plant refurbishments in Finland and Sweden, and gas turbine plant
refurbishments in Russia.

Fortum’s target was fewer than 23 major EHS incidents
annually. In 2016, 22 (18) major EHS incidents took place in
Fortum’s operations: the incidents included 11 non-compliances
with environmental permits, seven fires, one leak and three
explosions. These incidents did not have significant environmental
or financial impacts.

Social responsibility
Fortum’s social responsibility emphasises the secure supply of
electricity and heat, creating solutions for sustainable cities,
operational and occupational safety, employee wellbeing, as well
as ethical business operations and compliance with regulations.
At the end of 2016, OHSAS 18001 certification covered 99.9% of
Fortum’s power and heat production worldwide.

The average energy availability of Fortum’s CHP plants in 2016
was 97.4% (96.4%), clearly above the annual target level of 95%.

The total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) for Fortum
employees in 2016 was 1.9 (1.6) per one million working hours,
which is better than the Group-level frequency target (< 2.5).
Fortum’s target for the lost-workday injury frequency (LWIF) for own
personnel was 1.0 and it was achieved (1.1). The lost-workday injury
frequency for contractors was 3.0 (2.7), which is at the set target
level. The number of serious occupational accidents was 13 (14).

Implementation of the agreed actions to improve contractor
safety will continue with a specific focus on contractor safety and

2017, Fortum has changed the definition of the severity of work-
related accidents and is now focusing on the consequences or
potential consequences of an accident rather than the length of the
sick-leave. The Group target for 2017 is < 5 severe accidents. By 2020
our target is to reduce severe accidents to zero.

The percentage of sickness-related absences in 2016 was 2.4
(2.4), which is at the target level.

Changes in Fortum’s Management

In February 2016, Fortum announced that it will reorganise its
corporate structure effective 1 April 2016. The target of the new
organisation is to enable the implementation of the company’s new
vision and strategy, which were announced on 3 February 2016. The
new organisation comprises three business divisions: Generation,
City Solutions, and Russia. In addition, two development units
focusing on growing new businesses have been established: M&A
and Solar & Wind Development, and Technology and New Ventures.
The new organisation will also have four staff functions: Finance;
Legal; Strategy, People and Performance; and Corporate Affairs and
Communications.

Outlook

Key drivers and risks
Fortum’s financial results are exposed to a number of economic,
strategic, political, financial and operational risks.

One of the key factors influencing Fortum’s business
performance is the wholesale price of electricity in the Nordic
region. The key drivers behind the wholesale price development in
the Nordic region are the supply-demand balance, the prices of fuel
and CO, emissions allowances, and the hydrological situation.

The continued uncertainty in the global and European
economies has kept the outlook for economic growth
unpredictable. The overall economic uncertainty impacts
commodity and CO; emissions allowance prices, and this could
maintain downward pressure on the Nordic wholesale price of
electricity. In Fortum’s Russian business, the key drivers are
economic growth, the rouble exchange rate, regulation around the

heat business, and further development of electricity and capacity
markets. In all regions, fuel prices and power plant availability also
impact profitability. In addition, increased volatility in exchange
rates due to financial turbulence could have both translation and
transaction effects on Fortum’s financials, especially through the
Russian rouble and Swedish krona.

In the Nordic countries, the regulatory and fiscal environment
for the energy sector has also added risks for utility companies. The
main strategic risk is that the regulatory and market environment
develops in a way that we have not been able to foresee and prepare
for. In response to these uncertainties, Fortum has analysed
and assessed a number of future energy market and regulation
scenarios including the impact of these on different generation
forms and technologies. As a result, Fortum’s strategy was
renewed in 2016 to include broadening the base of revenues and
diversification into new businesses, technologies and markets.

For further details on Fortum’s risks and risk management, see
the> Risk management section of the Operating and financial
review and> Note 3 Financial risk management.

Nordic market
Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, electricity is expected to
continue to gain a higher share of total energy consumption.
Electricity demand in the Nordic countries is expected to grow
by approximately 0.5% on average, while the growth rate for the
next few years will largely be determined by macroeconomic
developments in Europe, and especially in the Nordic countries.
During 2016, oil and coal prices increased, while the price of CO>
emission allowances (EUA) declined. The price of electricity for the
upcoming twelve months appreciated in the Nordic area as well as in
Germany, and both are now on higher levels than at the end of 2015.
In mid-January 2017, the quotation for coal (ICE Rotterdam) for
the remainder of 2016 was around USD 74 per tonne and for CO2
emission allowances for 2017 around EUR 5 per tonne. The Nordic
system electricity forward price in Nasdaq Commodities for the rest
of 2017 was around EUR 26 per MWh and for 2018 around EUR 23
per MWh. In Germany, the electricity forward price for the rest of
2017 was around EUR 34 per MWh and for 2018 around EUR 30 per

MWh. Nordic water reservoirs were about 9 TWh below the long-
term average and 19 TWh below the corresponding level in 2016.

Generation

The Generation segment’s achieved Nordic power price typically
depends on such factors as the hedge ratios, hedge prices, spot
prices, availability and utilisation of Fortum’s flexible production
portfolio, and currency fluctuations. Excluding the potential effects
from changes in the power generation mix, a 1 EUR/MWh change
in the Generation segment's Nordic power sales achieved price
will result in an approximately EUR 45 million change in Fortum’s
annual comparable operating profit. In addition, the comparable
operating profit of the Generation segment will be affected by the
possible thermal power generation volumes and its profits.

Asa result of the nuclear stress tests in the EU, the Swedish
nuclear safety authority (SSM) has decided to propose new
regulations for Swedish nuclear reactors. The process is ongoing.
Fortum emphasises that maintaining a high level of nuclear safety
is the highest priority, but considers EU-level harmonisation of
nuclear safety requirements to be of continued importance.

The Swedish Government increased the nuclear waste fund fee
from approximately 0.022 to approximately 0.04 SEK/kWh for the
2015-2017 period. The impact on Fortum is approximately EUR
25 million annually. The process to review the Swedish nuclear
waste fees is done ina three-year cycle. The Swedish Nuclear Fuel
and Waste Management Co (SKB) will update the new technical
plan in early 2017 for SSM to review. The final decision on the new
nuclear waste fees will be made by the Swedish Government in
December 2017. However, as a result of the decision on early closure
of nuclear power plants, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority,
SSM, recalculated the waste fees for the Oskarshamn and Ringhals
power plants.

In September 2016 the Swedish government presented the
budget proposal for the coming years; One of the key elements was
the proposal that taxation of different energy production forms
should be more equal and the tax burden of nuclear and hydro
should be taken to the level of other production technologies. The
budget states that the nuclear capacity tax will be reduced to 1,500

SEK/MW per month from 1 July 2017 and abolished on 1 January
2018. In 2017, the tax is estimated to decrease by approximately
EUR 32 million to EUR 52 million due to the tax decrease and by
another EUR 5 million due to the premature closure of Oskarshamn
1in the middle of the year. In 2018, there is no capacity tax.

A decision was also made to decrease the hydropower real-
estate tax over a four-year period beginning in 2017, from todays
2.8% to 0.5%. The real-estate tax on hydro will, as stated in the
government's budget, be reduced in four steps: in January 2017
to 2.2%; in January 2018 to 1.6%; in January 2019 to 1.0%; and in
January 2020 to 0.5%. In 2017, the tax is estimated to decrease by
approximately EUR 20 million to approximately EUR 95 million.

In addition to the decrease in the tax rate, the hydropower
real-estate tax values, which are linked to electricity prices, will
be updated starting in 2019. The real-estate tax values are updated
every six years. With the current low electricity prices the tax values
in 2019 will be clearly lower than today. The process for renewing
existing hydro permits will also be reformed.

The tax reductions will be financed through a higher electricity
consumption tax that will mainly affect households. Electricity-
intensive industries will be exempt.

In October 2016, the Swedish Energy Agency presented a
concrete proposal on how to increase the production of renewable
electricity by 18 TWh in 2020-2030 within the electricity certificate
system, as part of the Energy Agreement. The government is
expected to decide on the proposal in late March 2017.

In 2015, OKG AB decided to permanently discontinue electricity
production at Oskarshamn unit 1 and to start decommissioning
after the permission for service operation has been granted by the
relevant Swedish authorities. The date for discontinued production
and the start of decommissioning has been set to 30 June 2017.
Oskarshamn unit 2, which has been out of operation since June
2013 due to an extensive safety modernisation, will stay out of
operation. The closing processes are estimated to take several
years.

In May, the Finnish Government decided to increase the tax on
heating fuels by EUR 90 million annually from 2017 onwards. The
negative impact on Fortum is estimated to be approximately EUR 5
million per year.

Russia
The Russia segment’s new capacity generation built after 2007
under the Russian Capacity Supply Agreement (CSA) is a key driver
for earnings growth in Russia, as it is expected to bring income
from new volumes sold and also to receive considerably higher
capacity payments than the old capacity. Fortum will receive
guaranteed capacity payments for a period of 10 years from the
commissioning ofa plant. The received CSA payment will vary
depending on the age, location, size and type of the plants, as
well as on seasonality and availability. CSA payments can vary
somewhat annually because they are linked to Russian Government
long-term bonds with 8 to 10 years’ maturity. In addition, the
regulator will review the earnings from the electricity-only market
three years and six years after the commissioning ofa unit and
could revise the CSA payments accordingly.

The Competitive Capacity Selection for generation built
prior to 2008 (CCS) takes place annually. The long-term CCS for
2017-2019 was held at the end of 2015, and the long-term CCS for
2020 was held in September 2016. The majority of Fortum’s plants
were selected. The volume of Fortum’s installed “old” capacity not
selected in the auction totalled 175 MW (out of 2,214 MW), for
which Fortum has obtained forced mode status, i.e. it will receive
payments for the capacity.

In December 2016, a bill draft containing the main principles
of the heat reform, approved by the Russian Government in 2014,
passed its first reading in the Russian Parliament. The draft
contradicts the Roadmap in some crucial points, e.g. it does not

include the requirement of the price liberalisation across the whole
country. Instead it requires the consent of both the regional and
the local authorities before starting the reform in certain pilot
regions. Ifimplemented, the reform should provide heat market
liberalisation in 5 or 10 years, depending on the Government-
imposed criteria.

The targeted operating profit (EBIT) level of RUB 18.2 billion in
the Russia segment is expected to be reached during 2017-2018.
‘The segment’s profits are impacted by changes in power demand,
gas prices and other regulatory developments. Economic sanctions,
the currency crisis, oil prices and the inflation have impacted
overall demand. Asa result, gas prices and electricity prices have
not developed favourably as expected. The Russian annual average
gas price growth was 3.6% in 2016. Fortum estimates the Russian
annual average gas price growth to be 2.0% in 2017.

The euro-denominated result level will be volatile due to the
translation effect. The income statements of non-euro subsidiaries
are translated into the Group reporting currency using average
exchange rates. The Russia segment’s result is also impacted by
seasonal volatility caused by the nature of the heat business, with
the first and last quarter being clearly the strongest.

Capital expenditure and divestments

Fortum currently expects its capital expenditure, excluding
acquisitions, to be approximately EUR 800 million in 2017. The
annual maintenance capital expenditure is estimated to be below
EUR 300 million in 2017, well below the level of depreciation.

Taxation

The effective corporate income tax rate for Fortum in 2017 is
estimated to be 19-21%, excluding the impact of the share of profits
of associated companies and joint ventures, non-taxable capital
gains and non-recurring items.

includes an overview of Fortum’s risk management systems
consisting of the general principles of risk management and the
main features of the risk management process. The objective of the
risk management framework and processes is to;

+ support the development of the Group strategy,

+ support strategy execution,

+ support the achievement of agreed targets within acceptable
risk levels so that the Group’s ability to meet financial
commitments is not compromised,

+ ensure the understanding of material risks and uncertainties
affecting Fortum’s earnings, and

+ ensure understanding and support the prevention of accidents
that can have a severe effect on the health and safety of
employees or third parties, and from incidents that can
have a material impact on Fortum’s assets, reputation or the
environment.

Risk management organisation

The main principle is that risks are managed at source meaning
that each Division, Development Unit and Corporate Function Head
is responsible for managing risks that arise within their business
operations. However, in order to take advantage of synergies,
certain risks are managed centrally. For example, Group Treasury is
responsible for managing financial risks and information security
risk are managed by Corporate Security. The Audit and Risk
Committee (ARC) is responsible for monitoring the efficiency of the
company’s risk management systems and for annually reviewing
the material risks and uncertainties. Corporate Risk Management,
a function headed by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reporting to the
CFO, provides instructions and tools which support the Group in
running an efficient risk management process. Corporate Risk

models.

Risk management process

Fortum’s risk management process is designed to support the
achievement of agreed targets by ensuring that risk management
activities are consistent with the general principles of risk
management and that risks are monitored and followed-up ina
prudent manner. The main features of risk management process

Risk manuals and Guidelines

consist of event identification, risk assessment, risk response
and risk control. Identification is carried out according to a
structured process and risks are assessed in terms of impact and
likelihood according to a Group-common methodology. Impact
is assessed in monetary terms, but also in terms of health and
safety, the environment and reputation where applicable. Risk
response actions are defined and implemented by the business
and operational management and can include to avoid, mitigate,
transfer or absorb the risk. Risk control processes, which include
monitoring and reporting of risks, are designed to support
compliance with approved instructions, manuals and guidelines
and to ensure that risk exposures remain within approved limits
and mandates.

Financial performance and position Risk management

Fortum’s Board of Directors annually approves the Group Risk
Policy and the CEO annually approves Group Risk Instruction
covering commodity market and fuel risks, counterparty credit
risks, financial risks and operational risks. There are also other
Group policies and instructions covering e.g. sustainability and
information security risks which are aligned with the Group Risk
Policy. Risk mandates or limits are defined for commodity market
and fuel risks, counterparty credit risks and financial risks.

Risk factors

Strate ks
The main strategic risk is that the regulatory and market
environment develops in way that we have not been able to foresee
and prepare for. In response to these uncertainties, Fortum has
analysed and assessed a number of future energy market and
regulation scenarios including the impact of these to different
generation forms and technologies. As a result, Fortum’s strategy
was renewed in 2016 to include broadening the base of revenues
and diversification into new businesses, technologies and markets.
Risks which could hinder Fortum in executing this strategy
have been identified as part of the strategy development and led to,
among other things, the creation of the five must-win battles. Risks
include an inability to identify and carry out successful investments
and acquisitions with the related project and integration risks,
inability to manage and respond to changes in energy policy and
the regulatory environment, and inability to manage and respond
to changes in technology.

Investment and acquisition risks

Fortum’s strategy includes growth of operations, including in

new businesses, technologies and geographies, and any future

investment or acquisition entails risk, including:

+ increased overall operating complexity and requirements for
management, personnel and other resources;

+ the need to understand the value drivers and their uncertainties
in investments or potential acquisition targets;

+ the need to understand and manage the new markets and
different cultural and compliance requirements;

+ the need to understand and manage subcontractor risks and
related sustainability and safety issues.

4 22>

These risks are managed as part of the investment process
which is being further developed to improve how we identify and
assess opportunities and how we integrate new businesses.

Energy policy and regulation risks

‘The energy business is subject to energy policies and regulations,
and Fortum’s strategy has been developed based on scenarios of the
future development of the regulatory environment in both existing
and potential new businesses and market areas. The overall
complexity and possible changes to regulations in the various
countries and regions pose a risk if we are not able to identify and
manage them efficiently.

Fortum maintains an active dialogue with the bodies involved in
the development of laws and regulations in order to manage these
risks and proactively participate in the development of the energy
policy and regulatory framework.

Nordic/EU

Fortum’s strategy in the power sector is based on a market-driven

development, which would mean more interconnections and

competition supported by policy harmonization. Even if the Nordic
power market has a long tradition of harmonization, national

policies vary considerably when it comes to generation (e.g.

taxation, permitting and subsidies) as well as consumption (e.g.

unbundling, taxation and market model) indicating that risks are

also national. Potential risks within the policy framework include;

1) the electricity market model where the EU is currently
discussing capacity remuneration mechanisms that could
change the market model,

2) targets for future climate change mitigation where the specific
details of targets for CO, emissions, renewables and energy
efficiency for 2030 are under discussion,

3) renewable energy where the Commission aims at presenting a
legislative proposal on sustainability criteria for solid biomass
at the end of 2016 and,

4) the implementation of the Water Framework Directive in
Sweden with potential effects on capacity and costs related to
hydro power production.

Financial performance and position Risk management

The inter-linkage of these issues as well as national measures
such as taxation create uncertainty and changes in policies in one
area could undermine the effects of policy changes in other areas.

As part of the Circular Economy package, the EU waste
legislation will set more ambitious recycling targets for waste.
This will have a market impact, but possibly also a tax impact, on
the amounts of non-recyclable waste that can be used for energy
production. The implementation of EU's heating and cooling
strategy through energy efficiency and renewable energy directives
will likely give policy direction towards better-functioning heat
markets and district heating systems. However, heating and
cooling, being local businesses, are primarily subject to local
legislation and regulations and thereby treated very differently in
different countries.

Russia

Russia is exposed to political, economic and social uncertainties
and risks resulting from changes in regulation, legislation,
economic and social upheaval and other similar factors. The
current economic sanctions may be enlarged and/or extended
having direct and indirect impacts on the business environment.
The main policy-related risks in Russia are linked to the
development of the whole energy sector, part of which, like the
wholesale power market, is liberalised while other parts, like
gas, heat, and retail electricity, are not. The wholesale power
market deregulation in Russia has been implemented toa large
extent according to original plans. However, regulated sectors are
inherently always exposed to a risk of regulatory changes which
could affect Fortum’s operations.

Technology risks

Fortum’s strategy includes developing or acquiring new
technologies. Fortum’s R&D activities focus on the development
of the energy system towards a future solar economy. Fortum is,
for example, developing circular economy, bioeconomy and other
renewable energy concepts as well as innovative solutions for its
customers. New technologies expose Fortum to new types of risks
such as risks related to intellectual property rights and viability of

technologies. Technology risks are managed primarily through
developing a diversified portfolio of projects consisting of different
technologies.

Corporate social responsibility

Corporate social responsibility and sustainable development

are integral parts of Fortum’s strategy. Fortum gives balanced
consideration to economic, environmental and social
responsibility. Changes to laws, regulations and the business
environment can pose a risk if not identified and managed
effectively. Same applies to changes of views of our main
stakeholders. In order to foresee and manage these risks, Fortum
endorses a number of international voluntary charters, standards
and guidelines in the area of sustainability, conducts stakeholder
surveys annually and has defined internal policies and instructions
of how to conduct business. Corporate Sustainability unit assesses
sustainability risks related to the Group's operations annually.
Risks identified by Corporate Sustainability are assessed by
Divisions and mitigation actions are defined.

Environmental, health and safety and social risks
Operating power and heat generation plants involves use, storage
and transportation of fuels and materials that can have adverse
effects on the environment and expose personnel to safety risks.
Assessment of environmental risks and preparedness to operate
in exceptional and emergency situations follows the requirements
set in ISO 14001 standard. The same approach based on the
requirements set in OHSAS 18001 standard applies to risks related
to occupational health and safety and actions in emergency
situations.

Environmental, health and safety (EHS) risks as well as social
risks related to Fortum’s supply chain are evaluated through
supplier qualification, internal and external audits and risk
assessments. Corrective and preventive actions are implemented
when necessary. EHS related risks together with social risks
arising in investments are evaluated in accordance with Fortum’s
Investment Evaluation and Approval Procedure. Environmental

risks and liabilities in relation to past actions have been assessed
and provisions have been made for future remedial costs.

Tax risk

Fortum operates in a number of countries and is therefore exposed
to changes in taxation and how tax authorities interpret tax laws.
Changes in the international fiscal environment have created a

tax environment that is leading to new or increased taxes and new
interpretations of existing tax laws. This has led to challenges for
Fortum and how its operations are taxed as the predictability and
visibility around taxes has decreased.

Fortum’s tax policy aims to identify simple and cost-efficient
solutions to manage taxes in a sustainable manner. Artificial or
other aggressive solutions are not used and legality and honesty
are seen as a high value together with transparent and open
information. Fortum is continuously following the development of
tax related issues and their impact on the Group and maintains an
active dialogue with tax authorities in unclear cases. Tax-related
issues are communicated both internally and externally. Fortum’s
tax footprint is published annually.

Business ethics and compliance risks

Fortum’s operations are subject to laws, rules and regulations set
forth by the relevant authorities, exchanges, and other regulatory
bodies in all markets in which Fortum operates. Fortum’s ability to
operate in certain countries may be affected by future changes to
local laws and regulations.

Fortum has an established Code of Conduct to enhance the
understanding of the importance of business ethics for all Fortum
employees, contractors and partners. The supplier code of conduct
sets sustainability requirements for suppliers of goods and
services.

Fortum systematically identifies, assesses, mitigates and
reports compliance risks including risks related to sustainability
and business ethics. Internal controls are implemented to
minimise the possibilities of unauthorised activities or non-
compliance with Group policies and instructions.

Financial performance and position Risk management

Financial risks

Market risk

Fortum’s business is exposed to fluctuations in prices and
availability of commodities used in the production and sales of
energy products. The main exposure is toward electricity prices and
volumes, prices of emissions and prices and availability of fuels.
Fortum hedges its exposure to commodity market risks in
accordance with annually approved Hedging Guidelines, Strategies
and Mandates. For further information on hedge ratios, exposures,
sensitivities and outstanding derivatives contracts, see» Note 3
Financial risk management.

Electricity price risks
In competitive markets, such as in the Nordic region, the price
is determined as the balance between supply and demand. The
short-term factors affecting electricity prices and volumes on the
Nordic market include hydrological conditions, temperature,
CO allowance prices, fuel prices, economic development and the
import/export situation.

Electricity price risks are hedged by entering into electricity
derivatives contracts, primarily on the Nasdaq Commodities
power exchange. Hedging strategies are continuously evaluated as
electricity and other commodity market prices, the hydrological
balance and other relevant parameters change. In Russia, electricity
prices and capacity sales are the main sources of market risk. The
electricity price is highly correlated with the gas price and prices are
fixed through bilateral agreements limiting exposure. In India, the
electricity price received from solar production are fixed through
long term power-purchasing agreements.

Emission and environmental value risks

‘The European Union has established an emissions trading

scheme to reduce the amount of CO; emissions. In addition to

the emissions trading scheme, there are other trading schemes in
environmental values in place in Sweden, Norway and Poland. Part
of Fortum’s power and heat generation is subject to requirements of

these schemes. There is currently no trading scheme in Russia for
emissions or other environmental values.

The main factor influencing the prices of CO2 allowances and
other environmental values is the supply and demand balance.
Fortum hedges its exposure to these prices and volumes through
the use of CO; forwards and environmental certificates.

Fuel price and volume risks

Power and heat generation requires use of fuels that are purchased
on global or local markets. The main fuels used by Fortum are
natural gas, uranium, coal, various biomass-based fuels and waste.
The main risk factor for fuels that are traded on global markets such
as coal and natural gas, is the uncertainty in price. Prices are largely
affected by demand and supply imbalances that can be caused by,
for example, increased demand growth in developing countries,
natural disasters or supply constraints in countries experiencing
political or social unrest. For fuels traded on local markets, such

as bio-fuels, the volume risk in terms of availability of the raw
material of appropriate quality is more significant as there may be

a limited number of suppliers. Due to the sanctions and economic
development in Russia, the risks related to imported fuels from
Russia have increased.

In the Nordic market, exposure to fuel prices is limited due to
Fortum’s flexible generation capacity which allows for switching
between different fuels according to prevailing market conditions.
In some cases, the fuel price risk can be transferred to the
customer. The remaining exposure to fuel price risk is mitigated
through fixed- price physical delivery contracts or derivative
contracts. The main fuel source for heat and power generation in
Russia is natural gas. Natural gas prices are partially regulated, so
the price risk exposure is limited.

Liquidity and refinancing risks

The power and heat business is capital intensive and Fortum has
aregular need to raise financing. Fortum maintains a diversified
financing structure in terms of debt maturity profile, debt
instruments and geographical markets. Fortum manages liquidity

and refinancing risks through a combination of cash positions and
committed credit facility agreements with its core banks.

After the Distribution divestments, Fortum has a large cash
position. The credit risk of this position has been mitigated
by diversifying the deposits to high-credit quality financial
institutions and issuers of corporate bonds.

Currency and interest rate risks
Fortum’s debt portfolio consists of interest-bearing liabilities
and derivatives ona fixed- and floating-rate basis with differing
maturity profiles. Fortum manages the duration of the debt
portfolio through use of different types of financing contracts and
interest rate derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps.
Fortum’s currency exposures are divided into transaction
exposures (foreign exchange exposures relating to contracted cash
flows and balance sheet items where changes in exchange rates
will have an impact on earnings and cash flows) and translation
exposure (foreign exchange exposure that arises when profits and
balance sheets in foreign entities are consolidated at the Group
level). The main principle is that all material transaction exposures
should be hedged while translation exposures are not hedged, or
are hedged selectively. The main translation exposures toward the
EUR/RUB and EUR/SEK are monitored continuously. When these
currencies are weak they affect Fortum’s profit level and equity
when translating results and net assets to euros.

Counterparty risks
Fortum is exposed to counterparty risk whenever there is a
contractual arrangement with an external counterparty including
customers, suppliers, partners, banks and trading counterparties.
Credit risk exposures relating to financial derivative instruments
are often volatile. Although the majority of commodity derivatives
are cleared through exchanges, derivatives contracts are also
entered into directly with external counterparties. Such contracts
are limited to high-credit-quality counterparties active on the
financial or commodity markets.
Due to the financing needs and management of liquidity,
Fortum has counterparty credit exposure to a number of banks

and financial institutions. This includes exposure to the Russian
financial sector in terms of deposits with financial institutions

as wellas to banks that provide guarantees for suppliers and
contracting parties. Deposits in Russia have been concentrated
to the most creditworthy state-owned or controlled banks. Limits
with banks and financial institutions are monitored so that
exposures can be adjusted as ratings or the financial situation
changes, and Fortum is following the development of economic
sanctions against Russia as part of the monitoring process.

Credit risk exposures relating to customers is spread across
awide range of industrial counterparties, small businesses and
private individuals over a range of geographic regions. The majority
of exposure is to the Nordic market, Poland and Russia. The risk of
non-payment in the electricity and heat sales business in Russia is
higher than in the Nordic market.

In order to manage counterparty credit risk, Fortum has
routines and processes to identify, assess and control exposure.
Credit checks are performed before entering into commercial
obligations and exposure limits are set for all larger individual
counterparties. Creditworthiness is monitored through the use
of internal and external sources so that mitigating actions can
be taken when needed. Mitigating actions include demanding
collateral, such as guarantees, managing payment terms and
contract length, and the use of netting agreements.

Operational risks

Operational risks are defined as the negative effects resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes, systems or equipment,

or from external events. Process-related risks are assessed and
controls for the most relevant risks are defined and implemented
as part of the internal controls framework. Equipment and system.
risks are primarily managed through monitoring and maintenance
planning.

Parent company
financial statements

Proposal for the use of the profit

Production risks

CHP

CHP production involves the use, storage and transportation of
fuels. Leakage of fuels and contamination of the surrounding
environment could lead to clean-up costs and third-party
liabilities. An explosion or fire at a production facility could cause
damages to the plant or third-parties and lead to possible business
interruption. These risks are mitigated by condition monitoring,
preventive maintenance and other operational improvements as
well as competence development of personnel operating the plants.

Hydro power

Operational events at hydro power generation facilities can

lead to physical damages, business interruptions, and third-

party liabilities. A long-term program is in place for improving

the surveillance of the condition of dams and for securing the
discharge capacity in extreme flood situations. In Sweden, third-
party liabilities from dam failures are strictly the plant owner's
responsibility. Together with other hydro power producers, Fortum
has a shared dam liability insurance program in place that covers
Swedish dam failure liabilities up to SEK 10,000 million.

Nuclear power
Fortum owns the Loviisa nuclear power plant, and has minority
interests in two Finnish and two Swedish nuclear power
companies. At the Loviisa power plant, the assessment and
improvement of nuclear safety is a continuous process performed
under the supervision of the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority
of Finland (STUK).

Third-party liability relating to nuclear accidents is strictly the
plant operator's responsibility and must be covered by insurance.
As the operator of the Loviisa power plant, Fortum has a statutory

Auditor's
report

Operational key figures Investor

Quarterly financial information

liability insurance policy of 686M SDR (Special Drawing Right) and
the same type of insurance policies are in place for the operators
where Fortum has a minority interest.

Under the Finnish law, Fortum bears full legal and financial
responsibility for the management and disposal of nuclear waste
produced by the Loviisa power plant. In both Finland and Sweden,
Fortum bears partial responsibility, proportionate to the ownership
share, for the costs of the management and disposal of nuclear
waste produced by co-owned nuclear power plants. The future
costs of the final disposal of spent fuel, the management of low
and intermediate-level radioactive waste and nuclear power plant
decommissioning are provided for by state-established funds in
Finland and Sweden to which nuclear power plant operators make
annual contributions.

Information security and IT risks
Fortum’s business operations are dependent on well-functioning IT
and information management systems and processes. Due to the
nature of the business, large amounts of data are processed, often
in real-time, and used for decision-making and in internal and
external communication and reporting. Securing information and
availability of the systems are essential for Fortum. Information
security risks, including cyber security and privacy, are managed
centrally by Corporate Security. Group instructions and procedures
set requirements for managing and mitigating information risks.
IT functions in the business, support functions and outsourcing
partners are responsible for identifying and mitigating operational
IT security related risks as well as managing IT security incidents.
IT functions are also responsible for IT service continuity.
