Board of Directors’ Report

Dear Shareholders,

lam pleased to share this Annual Review with you. 2019 was
another successful year for Sanoma anda year of good financial
development.

Sanoma has consistently implemented its strategy and devel-
oped the company further. Our ambition is to create growing
value for both our customer groups as well as our shareholders.
Today, the company is in a state where it has good and stable
growth prospects, the ability to pay growing dividends, and
the financial resources to choose its growth paths. We are well
positioned to take advantage of future opportunities.

In 2019, we took another important step on our carefully select-
ed strategic path to change Sanoma into a growing Europe-
an learning company and a strong local Finnish cross-media
company. Inthe future, we will operate in two different markets.
where we are best placed to serve our customers for genera-
tions to come. We see learning as a stable and growing busi-
ness where we have a strong foothold in some of the best and
most digitised education markets in the world. In Finland, our
unique cross-media solutions give us a strong position to suc-
ceed in the digital era and attract new customers.

Changeis a permanent phenomenon. The key in understanding
change, its effects and opportunities, is by comprehending the
scale ofit. The scale changes the way we view and perceive the
operating environment and how it changes. By understand-
ing and anticipating change, we can find new areas of growth
for ourselves and respond more quickly to our customers’
changing expectations and needs. By also looking towards
the long-term future, we can determine the right questions for
forthcoming strategic options, even when we do not yet have
all the answers.

Sanoma 2019

Financial Statements

Digitalisation is the underlying force of change. It will continue
and proceed to cover new areas and thereby affect our daily
lives in new ways. Sanoma embraces digitalisation as asea
of vast opportunities. Data is the fuel of digitalisation. With
data we can tailor content and learning services and create a
better fit with consumer needs. Data is closely linked to trust
and responsibility. We highly value this trust of our customers.
and apply high standard processes to secure the integrity of
personal data.

2019 marked the 130th anniversary of the launch of Helsingin
Sanomat's predecessor, Pdivdlehti. For Finnish news journal-
ism, the emphasis on freedom of expression and journalistic
independence has always been atthe heart of our news report-
ing. These strong values have guided us for 130 years, and we
continue to rely on them with the same determination for future
decades to come. Our recent announcement to acquire Alma
Media's regional news media business supports a sustainable
future of independent news media in Finland. Freedom of ex-
pression must be defended when itis atits strongest, because
once it has lost its power and confidence, there is no longer
means to defend it. It should not be taken for granted.

Both learning and media are businesses with a high purpose
for society and this attracts both employees and shareholders
to Sanoma. High-quality educational content and services sup-
port teachers and schools to reach high learning results and
thus supporting a prosperous and fair society. Media supports.
the freedom of speech, and local entertainment ensures shared
values and experiences creating a fair, open and transparent
society. This is not aside effect of our business, itis the essence
of it. The Board and Sanoma’s employees are highly committed
to our unique role in social responsibility.

“Both learning and

media are businesses

both employees and

| would like to express my gratitude to all Sanoma employ-
ees. Without your input and dedication, the company could
not succeed and develop. Change requires curiosity, courage,
commitment and humility. | strongly believe that Sanoma will
continue to be able to offer interesting challenges and opportu-
nities for our personnel while creating value for our customers
and shareholders.

Dear Shareholders, | would like to thank you for your continued
trust and support, and wish you interesting moments of reading

with this Annual Review.

Board of Directors’ Report

Financial Statements

Dear Shareholders,

2019 was a transformative and financially successful year for
Sanoma. | am very pleased to share an overview of our year with
you in this Annual Review.

2019 was a transformative year for Sanoma:
becoming a learning and media company

In 2019, we transitioned from a predominantly media company to
a growing European learning company with a strong cross-media
business in Finland. The decision to divest our media business in the
Netherlands was communicated early in December 2019, and was
amgjor step for Sanoma. In recent years, we had already divested
our Dutch TV business, SBS, and the Belgian magazine portfolio.
The remaining media business in the Netherlands was largely a
standalone magazine business for which we had limited growth
opportunities. It proved to be difficult to give it a strong digital future
without the support of a wider range of media products, especially
news media like we have in Finland.

The divestment of Media Netherlands gives us a M&A headroom of
EUR 400 million, and thus opportunities to continue on our growth
path and make carefully selected strategic acquisitions in our learning
business, and to a lesser extent also in our Finnish media business.

Transforming with our customers

Digitalisation is the key driver of change in both education and me-
dia. To succeed, we must follow and fulfil the needs of our customers.
“Following our customers” has been at the heart of our strategy now
for five years and it has proven to give us the guidance needed to be
successful in the markets.

To keep our content and services relevant, we must maintain a con-
stant dialogue with our customers - schools, teachers, students, ad-
vertisers, readers and audiences - and understand their changing

Corporate Governance Statement

Remuneration Statement

needs. We embrace digitalisation with all the opportunities it brings
in enriching both our learning and media content.

Agrowing European education businessinthe
most advanced education markets in the world

Sanoma has chosen K12 (from kindergarten to 12th grade) learning
services as one ofits key strategic business areas in which to grow. By
nature, the education businessis more stable and less affected by short-
term economic changes, anditis positively impacted by digitalisation.

We have come a long way in the past 20 years since Sanoma
Learning was initiated by merging Sanoma's and WSOY's educa-
tional publishing business. We started 2019 being present in five
countries and serving 6 million users on Sanoma platforms, and
ended the year being active in 10 countries serving over 15 million
students and teachers through our platforms and learning materials.

Weclosed the acquisition of Iddink, a leading Dutch educational plat-
form and service provider, in September, having already announced
that deal atthe end of 2018. And we ended the year 2019 by acquiring
three smaller and very carefully targeted learning businesses: Essener,
itslearning and Clickedu. In 2020, we expect net sales of our learning
business to be around EUR 500 million, double the size it had four years
ago. Wesee interesting growth opportunities to explore, both in those
markets where we are already active and in adjacent markets.

We are now actively involved in the digital learning platform busi-
ness, providing us with a strong foothold in future digital learning
environments. This key vertical integration into digital learning
platform solutions will also facilitate the introduction for Sanoma
Learning into some of the larger European educational markets. We
also announced long-term financial targets for Sanoma Learning
to be comparable net sales growth of 2-5% and operational EBIT
margin excluding PPA of 20-22%.

Year 2019

Board of Directors’ Report

Our strong Finnish cross-media business
provides independent news and local
entertainment for generations to come

Sanoma Media Finlandis the leading cross-media business in Finland
with a very unique market position and strong presence in almost
all media segments. Its roots extend back to 1889 when Pdivdlehti,
predecessor of Helsingin Sanomat, was founded; and in 2019 we
celebrated Helsingin Sanomat's 130th birthday.

The Finnish media business, with its leading positions in news & fea-
ture, entertainment, and B2B marketing solutions, has managed to
further digitalise and growits business. The strength of the combina-
tion of the various media positions allows us to follow the changing
preferences of consumers across all media types. At the end of 2019,
we also announced long-term financial targets for Sanoma Media
Finland: comparable net sales growth of +/-2% and operational EBIT
margin excluding PPA of 12-14%.

Helsingin Sanomat continued to grow its subscription base for the
third consecutive year. This is also truly remarkable when compared
on a global scale. What is especially interesting is that Helsingin
Sanomat has managed to attract new readers and subscribers from
the younger, more demanding, audiences. This shows how the young-
er generation increasingly values independent and reliable news.
With the experience of this successful digital development and the
requirement of scale in the digital era, we announced our intention
to acquire Alma Media's regional news media business in February
2020 in order to make both businesses even more sustainable with
increasing digitalisation.

We made a major simplification in our business by combining the
two news media brands - Helsingin Sanomat, the leading national
subscription news, and Ilta-Sanomat, the leading tabloid and digital
news service - with seven of our feature magazine brands into one
organisation. All to better serve our readers and to offer our advertis-
ing customers strong marketing solutions to grow their businesses.

Sanoma 2019

Financial Statements

In entertainment, we grew our video-on-demand subscription base
by more than 25%, and Supla application for audio-on-demand also
gained further user base. This clearly shows that increasing consumer
preference for subscription-based, on-demand, contentservices are
playing to Sanoma's strengths in content and subscription manage-
ment.

Learning and media have a clear contribution
to society in common

Our two businesses, learning and media, both contribute positively
tosociety.

The objective of modern education is to develop the full potential of
every student, which helps in building a strong foundation fora stable,
productive and prosperous society. Our modern, high-quality materi-
als, methods and digital platforms for schools, teachers and students
contribute to students’ motivation, excellent learning outcomes and
achieving students’ full potential.

Domestic, independentjournalism reflects and supports society and
its values. It ensures that multiple voices and perspectives in society
get heard and contributes to a strong, vibrant, transparent and fair
democracy. Our responsible B2B marketing solutions enable entre-
preneurs to reach their customers and contribute to overall econom-
ic growth and employment. Advertising also increases consumers’
awareness of products and services.

Datais an increasingly essential part of both the learning and media
businesses putting privacy and consumertrust atthe core of our daily
operations. Through optimal use of data-enabled tailoring andtarget-
ing, we can provide individualised learning paths and even more com-
pelling media content- and create value to our users and customers.

With responsible business practices, we aim to prevent and minimise
negative environmental impacts across our business by focusing on
efficient operations and use of materials as well as responsible value
chain by asking our suppliers to operate in a similar manner.

Corporate Governance Statement

Remuneration Statement

Our teams make the transformation happen

Transforming the company takes a lotfrom our teams. Constantfocus
on our customers and their changing needs and preferences means
thatnoteam, no individual can rely solely on past experiences. Curios-
ity, learning and constant adaption are a reality for all of us. Constantly
challenging ourselves and ourteamsis essential for business success.

With our recent acquisitions, we welcomed 600 new Sanoma col-
leagues at Iddink, Itslearning, Essener, and Clickedu. And during 2020,
we hope to be able to welcome nearly another 400 colleagues from
Alma Media regional news media business.

Atthe year end, John Martin - our valued colleague and CEO of Sanoma
Learning, and member of Sanoma's Executive Management Team -
decided to leave Sanoma after asuccessful career of 10 yearsleading
the digital transformation of Sanoma Learning and creating one Eu-
ropean learning company out of our five operating companies in as
many countries. We are very grateful for his drive and commitment
with which he has led the team and the business to this success, and
we wish him the bestin his future endeavours.

Rob Kolkman, CEO of Sanoma Media Netherlands, was appointed
CEO for Sanoma Learning as of 1 January 2020. Rob isan experienced,
well-respected and results-driven business leader with a strong inter-
national track record. He knows both the digital and publishing busi-
nesses, and will bea great leader for our Learning team. Rob Kolkman.
will continue as a member of Sanoma's Executive Management Team
and lead Media Netherlands till the divestmentis finalised.

| want to thank you, our shareholders, customers, partners and em-
ployees, for your trust and commitmentin making our transformation
journey possible and supporting us in developing Sanoma further into

Report of the Board of Directors for 2019

On 10 December 2019, Sanoma announced it had signed an
agreement to divest its strategic business unit (SBU) Sanoma
Media Netherlands. Media Netherlands is consequently re-
ported as discontinued operations in Sanoma’s financial state-
ments for 2019 and in this report. Unless otherwise stated, all
income statement-related figures as well as non-financial
information for 2018 and 2019 cover continuing operations
only. Figures related to balance sheet and cash flow cover both
continuing and discontinued operations. Continuing operations
include two SBUs, i.e. Sanoma Learning and Sanoma Media
Finland, which are also Sanoma’s reporting segments. After the
divestment, the remaining Group costs have been allocated to
Learning and Media Finland SBUs and SBU-level comparative
information for 2018 and 2019 has been adjusted accordingly.

Strategic review

During 2019 Sanoma took further significant steps in its suc-
cessful strategic transformation from a predominantly media
company into a combination of a growing European-based
learning company and the leading cross-media company in
Finland. Learning was strengthened with four acquisitions
during the second half of the year - Iddink, Essener, itslearning
and Clickedu - and the intention to divest Media Netherlands
to DPG Media was announced in December. The Group’s busi-
ness portfolio is well-balanced: after the recent acquisitions
and the divestment of Media Netherlands approx. 45% of the
Group's net sales and 55% of operational earnings will come
from Learning.

In Learning, the most sizable acquisition was Iddink, a leading
Dutch educational platform and service provider, which was
closed in September 2019 after signing already in December
2018. Iddink operates in the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain
and provides Sanoma new business opportunities with its direct
access to the school management. With acquisitions done in
2019, Learning’s customer base grew by 50% to about 15 mil-

Sanoma 2019

lion primary, secondary and vocational education students.
Its operations expanded into five new European countries and
its offering of blended learning materials and methods were
complemented with digital platforms for teaching and school
administration, learning material distribution business, as well
as testing and analytics tools.

Media Finland focuses increasingly on its three core strategic
businesses: news & feature, entertainment and B2B market-
ing solutions. During the year its news & feature operations
were combined into a new unit to respond better to the trans-
forming media consumption. The new organisation consists
of the two main news media brands, Helsingin Sanomat and
IIta-Sanomat, as well as a number of lifestyle magazine brands.
With a more focused organisation Media Finland aims to be
successful in the subscribed and ad-funded journalism both
in the current hybrid and in the future digital era. The enter-
tainment business was strengthened with Rockfest, Finland’s
largestrockand metal music festival, and two small local radio
stations. Share of more volatile print advertising continued to
decline and today it represents only 7% of the Group's total net
sales. In June, Sanoma increased its ownership in the Finnish
online classifieds company Oikotie to 100% to simplify further
development of the business.

After the divestment of Media Netherlands, Sanoma has two
strong businesses, Learning and Media Finland, ready for
growth, and a EUR 400 million headroom for M&A. Sanoma
has solid M&A pipelines for both Learning and Media Finland.
In Learning, it is looking for growth opportunities in new geog-
raphies and in expanding its offering in the current ten oper-
ating countries. In Media Finland, it is interested in synergis-
tic acquisitions in its strategic focus areas of news & feature,
entertainment or B2B marketing solutions. Also in light of its
growth agenda, Sanoma is committed to its dividend policy:
an increasing dividend corresponding to 40-60% of annual
free cash flow.

Financial Statements

Financial position

Atthe end of December 2019, interest-bearing net debt was EUR
795 million (2018: 338). The increase was due to the acquisition
of Iddink, completed in September, and the implementation of
IFRS 16, which had an impact of EUR 188 million. In November,
Sanoma repaid a EUR 200 million bond. The repayment reduced
the average interest rate of external loans to 2.3% (2018:2.5%).
Net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.7 (2018: 1.4). Due to
the Iddink acquisition and the implementation of the IFRS 16
standard, the ratio increased temporarily above the long-term
target level of below 2.5.

At the end of December 2019, equity totalled EUR 551 million
(2018: 611), including EUR 105 million capital loss (impair-
ment loss on classification as asset-held-for-sale under IFRS
5) related to the divestment of Media Netherlands. Equity ratio
declined to 30.5% (2018: 44.7%). Due to the Iddink acquisition,
the divestment of Media Netherlands and the implementation
ofthe IFRS 16 standard, the ratio decreased temporarily below
the long-term target level of 35-45%. The consolidated balance
sheet totalled EUR 1,998 million (2018: 1,519).

Cash flow

The Group’s free cash flow grew to EUR 131 million (2018: 109).
The implementation of the IFRS 16 standard improved the free
cash flow by EUR 25 million. The improvement was further sup-
ported by lower taxes paid. A EUR 10 million settlement of a
rental contract related to discontinued operations divested in
June 2018 in Belgium and expenditures related to changes in
ITinfrastructure and services across the Group had an adverse
impact on free cash flow. Capital expenditure included in free
cash flow was EUR 32 million (2018: 32). Free cash flow per
share was EUR 0.81 (2018:0.67), impact of the implementation
of the IFRS 16 standard being EURO.15.

As a result of acquisitions, in particular Iddink, net sales grew
to EUR 337 million (2018: 313).Onacomparable basis, Learn-
ing’s net sales were stable, comparable net sales growth de-
velopment being 0%. Net sales grew in Belgium and Poland
driven by increased demand during curriculum renewals. Inthe
Netherlands, comparable net sales were at the previous year’s
level. Net sales declined in Finland due to lower demand after
the ending ofthe curriculum renewal atthe end of 2018 andan
increasing share of digital learning materials, where sales are
recognised monthly throughout the school year.

Operational EBIT excl. PPA improved and was EUR 73 million
(2018: 64). Half of the earnings improvement was attributable
to the acquisition of Iddink and half to lower variable and fixed
expenses in the underlying business as a result of the business
development programme “High Five”. Change in the allocation
of Group costs related to the divestment of Media Netherlands
had an adverse impact on earnings.

EBIT was EUR 55 million (2018:55).|ACs totalled EUR -12 million
(2018:-5) and mainly consisted of costs related to acquisitions,
business development programme “High Five” and changesin
IT infrastructure and services. PPA amortisations increased to
EUR 6 million (2018: 3) due to the acquisition of Iddink.

Net sales of Media Finland were stable and amounted to EUR
577 million (2018: 579). Comparable net sales development
was -2%. During the year, TV, radio and digital advertising sales
grew, while print advertising sales declined. As a result of strong
growth in digital subscription sales, total subscription sales of
Helsingin Sanomat were at an all-time-high. Subscription sales
of Ruutu+ grew, while discontinuation of pay-TV in 2018 hada
negative impact on subscription sales in the first half of 2019.
Inthe second half of the year, single copy sales of IIta-Sanomat
and lifestyle magazines were supported by the decline in VAT of
single copies, which became effective on 1 July 2019. Increase
in other sales was attributable to growth in the festival and
events sales, as well as the music publishing business acquired
inQ4 2018.

According to the Finnish Advertising Trends survey for Decem-
ber 2019 by Kantar TNS, the advertising market in Finland de-
clined by 1% on anet basis in 2019. Advertising declined by 9%
in newspapers, by 7% in magazines and by 5% in TV, whereas
advertising in radio increased by 6% and in online, including
search and social media, by 9%.

Operational EBIT excl. PPA was at the previous year’s level and
amounted to EUR 69 million (2018: 70). Improved profitability
ofthe festival and events business, as well as lower marketing,
paper, distribution and other operating costs all had a positive
contribution on earnings. Higher TV programme costs related
to FOX channels, as well as change in the allocation of Group
costs related to the divestment of Media Netherlands, had an
adverse impact on earnings.

EBIT was EUR 55 million (2018: 59). IACs totalled EUR -10 mil-
lion (2018:-7) and included costs related to strategic business
development as well as changes in the IT infrastructure and
services. PPA amortisations were EUR 4 million (2018: 3).

Capital expenditure totalled EUR 4 million (2018: 4) and con-
sisted of maintenance investments.

required to apply the Code in full in their day-to-day conduct
and business decisions.

Specific policies define how Sanoma’s operations are man-
aged, and give a framework to daily work. The Board of Di-
rectors of Sanoma Corporation approves new policies and
amendments to existing policies. Each policy has a specified
owner in the organisation. Once a year, or when needed, the
owners submit necessary updates or new policies to the Board
for approval. The policies are applicable to all employees inthe

Sanoma expects commitmentto ethical and responsible busi-
ness conduct also from its suppliers. Sanoma has a Supplier
Code of Conduct, which sets out the ethical standards and re-
sponsible business principles suppliers are required to comply
with in their dealings with Sanoma. Suppliers are expected
to apply these standards and principles to their employees,
affiliates and sub-contractors.

Together, Sanoma Code of Conduct and the Supplier Code
of Conduct set out overall principles to promote and achieve
compliance e.g. with anti-corruption, anti-bribery and money
laundering laws.

Reporting Channels

Sanoma Code of Conduct, the Supplier Code of Conduct, and
Sanoma's group policies and operating procedures are intend-
ed to prevent and detect improper or illegal activities. Any sus-
picions about violations can be reported anonymously through
internal or external reporting channels. Sanoma has an external
online whistle-blowing tool, which is hosted by an independent
third party, in use. Link to the whistle-blowing tool is available
on Sanomo’s website and intranet.

Head of Internal Audit and the Compliance Officer receive
emails of the allegations reported through the whistle-blowing
tool. Cases are also identified during internal audits or through
other internal channels, such as a network of nominated Local
Compliance Officers. All allegations are reviewed and investi-
gative activities planned without delay. All cases and conclu-
sions of investigations are reported to the Ethics and Compli-
ance Committee and to the Audit Committee of the Board.

Data integrity

Data is an increasingly essential part of Sanoma’s business
putting privacy and consumer trust at the core of the Group’s
daily operations. Through optimal use of data-enabled tailoring
and targeting, Sanoma can provide individualised learning
paths and even more compelling media content.

Financial Statements

Sanoma has invested in data-security-related technologies
andrunsaGroup-wide privacy programme to ensure that em-
ployees know how to apply data security and privacy practices
in their daily work. Privacy is incorporated into product develop-
ment through a “Privacy by Design” process supported by “Pri-
vacy Champions”, who are nominated employees with privacy
responsibilities in their respective business areas.

Sanoma has aprivacy e-learning in use. In addition, role-based
privacy and information security trainings are offered to specific
employee groups. In 2019, completion rate of the e-learning
among targeted employees was 94% (2018: 98% incl. dis-
continued operations). In the newly acquired companies, the
e-learning takes place within 3-6 months after the acquisition
is completed.

Environmental impact

The most significant environmental impacts of Sanoma’s op-
erations result from the use of paper and print supplies, energy
use e.g. in printing houses, offices and for digital services, as
well as transportation and distribution of products. Sanoma
aims to prevent and minimise its negative environmental im-
pacts by efficient operations and use of materials as well as
responsible procurement.

Sanoma’s Paper Procurement Standard is annexed to all paper
procurement agreements. The aim of the standard is to en-
sure that paper used by Sanomais produced responsibly and
originates from traceable and verified sources. At least 80% of
wood fibre in the paper qualities used by Sanoma originates
from certified sources.

In 2019, Sanoma's paper use in continuing operations declined
by 5,600 tons, or by 10% driven by the prevailing mediatrend of
consumers moving from printed to hybrid or digital media prod-
ucts. Use of newsprint declined by 15% and magazine paper
by 14%. Inthe learning business, use of book paper was stable
being in-line with the comparable net sales development.

Sanomauses purchased electricity e.g. in printing and office fa-
cilities, as well as for digital services and technological solutions.
The indirect CO, emissions resulting from Sanomo’s electricity
use are dependent on the mix of energy sources used in the na-

Sanoma sees visible and transparent leadership important
in its daily business. Sanoma’s managers provide employees
with clarity regarding the direction of the company. Employees’
autonomy and freedom in achieving results is supported, which
fosters creativity.

Among other things, professional development, motivation, cre-
ativity and engagementare facilitated in regular performance
review discussions. In 2019, approx. 90% (2018: 90%) of em-
ployees had aregular performance review with their manager.

Sanoma measures employee engagement, leadership, internal
communication and decision making annually in the beginning
of each calendar year. In January 2020, the Employee Engage-
ment Survey was completed by 88% (2018: 92% incl. discon-
tinued operations) of employees. The scores are measured in
People Power Rating, an inclusive overall metric between 0 and
100. In 2020, the results improved somewhat from the previous
year being overall ata very good level. The results of the survey
are also utilised in the management incentive system.

According to the Employee Engagement Survey, employees feel
that Sanoma's strengths as an employer include

= sufficientlearning opportunities offered for the employees,

™ support for growth and development at work from the man-
agement, and

=™ opportunities for career development.

Diversity at Sanoma is guided by a Group-wide Diversity policy.
According to the policy, Sanoma recruits, develops and rewards
all employees irrespective of age, gender, ethnic origin, sexual
orientation, family status, disability or other personal circum-
stances (e.g. wealth), or any other form of discrimination. Re-
cruitment, remuneration and career advancement are based
on employee competence and performance.

Supply chain, anti-bribery and corruption

Sanoma’s anti-bribery and corruption policy gives specific rules
and monetary limits (EUR 75) for received and given gifts, en-
tertainment and hospitality, and sets out the process to seek
further approval through a separate gift and hospitality tool
if necessary. When it comes to public officials, receiving and
giving gifts is totally forbidden.

Sanoma has an anti-bribery and corruption e-learning in use.
In 2019, completion rate of the e-learning among targeted em-
ployees was 93% (2018: 97% incl. discontinued operations).
In the newly acquired companies, the e-learning takes place
within 3-6 months after the acquisition is completed.

The Supplier Code of Conduct forms an important component
ofthe procurement and purchasing framework, including sup-
plier selection, evaluation and performance appraisal. All new
supplier engagements initiated via Sanoma’s source-to-con-
tract solution incorporate the Supplier Code of Conduct as a
mandatory step for successful selection. The Supplier Code of
Conductis part of Sanoma's standard contractual framework
and general terms of purchase.

A Know Your Counterparty (KYC) process identifies the risk of
doing business with third parties by looking at their ownership,
activities and role. The process includes anti-bribery, sanctions
and other due diligence checks according to the level of risk
identified. Systematic KYC checks covering certain existing and
almost all new vendors were carried out during the year by
Group Procurement.

Sanoma 2019

Financial Statements

AKYC due diligence tool for the use of Sanoma employees is
available on the intranet to screen thoroughly notjust suppliers,
but any third party Sanoma intends to do business with. The tool
aims to identify and prevent possible third party compliance
and corruption-related risks, according to customised criteria.
In cases of medium or high risk, the tool refers employees to
consult Group Legal before engaging in any business or trans-
action with the counterparty.

Corporate Governance Statement

Remuneration Statement

Risk review

Sanomais exposed to numerous risks and opportunities, which
may arise from its own operations or the changing operating
environment. Sanoma divides its key risks into four main cate-
gories: strategic, operational, non-financial and financial risks.
The most significant risks that could have a negative impact
on Sanomoa’s business, performance, or financial status are
described below. Under the categories, the most material risks
are presented first.

The structure of Sanoma’s business will change significantly
with the divestment of Media Netherlands (announced in De-
cember 2019 and expected to be completed latest during Q3
2020) and its currently estimated main impacts on Sanoma's
overall risk position are included in this review. In addition to
risks presented in this review, currently unknown or immaterial
risks may arise or become material in the future.

Risk management andinternal control policies, processes, roles
and responsibilities are presented in the Corporate Governance
Statement 2019. Significant near-term risks and uncertainties
are reported on acontinuous basis in each Interim Report dur-
ing the course of the year.

Strategic risks

Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)

Sanoma's strategic aim is to grow through acquisitions. In M&A,
the key risks may relate to the availability of potential M&A tar-
gets, suitability of timing, transaction process, integration of the
acquired business, retention of key personnel, or achievement
of the targets set.

Sanoma mitigates the risks by actively maintaining its indus-

trial networks, proactively seeking for potential targets, work-
ing with well-known parties during the transaction processes

23


--- Page 23 ---

Year 2019 Board of Directors’ Report

and following its internal policies and procedures in decision-
making, organisation and follow-up of M&A cases.

Changes in customer preferences and the threat of
new entrants

Changes in customer preferences are visible not only in con-
sumer behaviour, but also both directly and indirectly in B2B and
public demand. Ongoing digitalisation and mobilisation are the
main drivers behind many of these changes. In education, dig-
ital learning materials, methods and platforms are gradually
penetrating the market. The increasing use of mobile devices is
changing the way people consume media, while viewing time
of free-to-air TV is decreasing.

Sanoma partially mitigates the risk by continuous development
of digital and hybrid learning and media products and services.
In learning, close and long-term relations with schools, teachers
and governing bodies play a significant role in the business,
and digital solutions are typically combined and sold together
with printed materials. The wide cross-media offering provides
Sanoma a solid base to constantly develop its offering to ad-
vertisers and to introduce new services, such as cross-media
solutions, native or branded and premium content. Neverthe-
less, new entrants and/or new technological developments
entering the markets possess a risk for Sanoma's established
businesses.

Political and legislative risks

Changesin governmental or legislative bodies or general polit-
ical instability in the operating countries may affect Sanoma's
ability to effectively conduct business. Key legislative risks may
relate to changing educational regulation, changes in the use
of consumer data for commercial purposes, deterioration of
publishers’ and broadcasters’ copyright protection, or changes
in tax legislation or in the interpretation of tax laws and prac-
tices. These risks can have a significant impact on Sanoma’s
commercial propositions, content investment needs or financial
performance.

Sanoma 2019

Financial Statements

Close monitoring and anticipation of political and regulatory
development and adaption of business models accordingly
are ways to partially mitigate these risks. Legislation related
to education, in particular, is typically country-specific, limiting
the magnitude of the risk on the Group level.

General economic conditions

The general economic conditions in Sanoma's operating coun-
tries and the overall industry trends could influence Sanoma's
business, performance or financial status. In general, risks as-
sociated with the performance of the learning business relate
to development of public and private education spending es-
pecially during the curriculum renewals. In the media business,
risks associated with business and financial performance typi-
cally relate to advertising demand and consumer spending. The
volume of media advertising is especially sensitive to overall
economic development and consumer confidence.

Sanoma'’s diverse business portfolio partially mitigates the risk.
In 2019, approx. 37% (2018: 23%) of Sanoma’s net sales was
derived from learning, approx. 26% (2018: 36%) from single
copy or subscription sales, approx. 7% (2018: 7%) from print
advertising, approx. 20% (2018: 18%) from non-print adver-
tising and approx. 10% (2018: 15%) from other sales (2018
comparison figures include continuing and discontinued op-
erations).

Operational risks

Data and privacy risks

Data is an increasingly essential part of Sanoma’s products
and services in both the learning and media business. The EU
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets strict require-
ments for implementing data subject rights, and for companies
to demonstrate their accountability for complying with the reg-
ulation. Non-compliance with the GDPR could lead to fines of up
to 4% of the annual global turnover. In addition, the ePrivacy Di-
rective imposes requirements for online data collection and use.

Corporate Governance Statement

Remuneration Statement

The most relevant risks pertaining to data privacy are potential
data breaches resulting from unauthorised or accidental loss
of or access to personal data managed by Sanoma or by third
parties processing data on Sanoma's behalf, or other failure to
comply with privacy laws.

To mitigate the risk and ensure compliance, Sanoma runs a Pri-
vacy Programme that monitors development and enforcement
of privacy regulations and has oversight of the implementation
of Privacy Policy. Key privacy implementation processes in-
clude data lifecycle management, negotiating data processing
agreements with third parties, information security measures
to protect data, data breach management procedures, and im-
plementation of data subject rights. Privacy requirements and
threat assessments are incorporated into product development
and privacy impact assessments are regularly conducted to
ensure compliance of products and services. Employees with
privacy responsibilities have been nominated and trained to
act as a first line of privacy support, and role-based privacy
trainings are offered to key target groups. During 2019 Sanoma
participated in the development of a standardised approach to
manage online data consents by the IAB (Interactive Advertis-
ing Bureau) Finland’s Transparency and Consent Framework.

Information and communication technology (ICT)
Reliable ICT systems form an integral part of Sanoma’s busi-
ness. The systems include online services, digital learning plat-
forms, newspaper and magazine subscriptions, advertising
and delivery systems, as well as various systems for produc-
tion control, customer relations management, and supporting
functions. ICT security risks relate to confidentiality, integrity,
and/or availability of information, as well as to reliability and
compliance of data processing. The risks can be divided into
physical risks (e.g. fire, sabotage and equipment breakdown)
and logical risks (e.g. information security risks, such as mal-
ware attacks, hacking of persona data or other sensitive data
assets, and employee or software failure).

24


--- Page 24 ---

Year 2019 Board of Directors’ Report

To mitigate the risks, Sanoma has continuity and disaster re-
covery plans for its critical systems and clear responsibilities
regarding ICT security in place. Information security controls
include the use of threat intelligence capabilities, cyber secu-
rity incident detection capabilities, identity and access man-
agement solutions, log management capabilities and the use
of external information security audits. During 2019 Sanoma
invested in a transition to cloud to improve flexibility, security,
availability and to decrease costs.

Risks related to third parties

A wide network of third parties plays an integral role in
Sanoma’s daily business. Third-party suppliers in Sanoma’s
value chain include, among others, paper and print suppliers
and transport, distribution, technology solution and IT hosting
service providers. Freelancers support Sanoma's own editorial
staffin creating learning materials and media content. The sta-
tus of freelancers may vary by authority and by country. How-
ever, no individual case is estimated to become material unless
it escalates to concern a large group of freelancers. Certain
advertising and marketing efforts are executed with the help of
third parties. The advertising technology ecosystem consists of
players, such as Google and Facebook, that have a dominant
market power, which may lead to an imbalance between their
rights and liabilities. Cooperation with third parties exposes
Sanoma to certain financial, operational, legal as well as data
and GDPR-related risks, which are described in more detail in
other sections of this risk review.

To mitigate the risks related to third parties, Sanoma follows
the guiding principles of supplier risk management set in the
Group's Procurement policy, Supplier Code of Conduct and legal
framework. The mostsignificant suppliers are selected through
competitive bidding and qualification process. Sanoma per-
forms Know Your Counterparty -controls as part of the supplier
approval process, and monitors the performance of third par-
ties by performance approvals and service-level agreements.

Sanoma 2019

Financial Statements

Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs)

Key IPRs related to Sanoma’s products and services are cop-
yrights including publishing rights, trademarks, business
names, domains, and know-how, as well as patents related to
e-business and utility models owned and licensed by the Group.
Sanoma manages its IPR in accordance with the Group-wide
IPR policy and procedures. Because of a dispersed IPR portfo-
lio, no material risks are expected to arise from individual IPR
cases.

Hazard risks

Hazard risks include risks associated with business interrup-
tion, health and safety or environmental issues. They are miti-
gated through operational policies, efficient and accurate pro-
cess management, contingency planning and insurance. Due
to the nature of Sanoma’s business, hazard risks are not likely
to have a material effect on Sanoma's performance.

Non-financial risks

Talent attraction and retention

Sanoma’s success depends on competence and continuous
development of the skills of its management and personnel. In
particular, the ability to develop appealing customer products
and services in changing environmentis crucial for success. The
ability to ensure the right skillset for the digital transformation
as well as to attract and retain the right talents, especially in re-
lation to acquisitions, may possess a riskto Sanoma’s business
and financial performance.

To mitigate the risk, Sanoma enhances a corporate culture sup-
porting innovation, creativity, diversity, as well as an ethical and
efficient way of working. The culture is further supported by open
and transparent leadership and communications, knowledge
sharing between businesses and functions, as well as opportu-
nities and resources for learning and professional development.
The Code of Conduct and Diversity Policy set the framework for
corporate culture and employee relations. Sanoma follows em-
ployee engagement closely by an annual survey.

Corporate Governance Statement

Remuneration Statement

Environmental risks

Sanoma's main environmental impacts derive from energy
use, paper and printing ink use and distribution. Sanoma aims
to prevent and minimise negative environmental impacts by
focusing on efficient operations and material use as well as
responsible procurement. Sanoma's processes support com-
pliance with relevant environmental legislative, regulatory and
operating standards. Due to the nature of Sanoma’s business,
no material environmental risks are expected to arise.

Risks related to human rights, anti-corruption and
bribery

Sanoma operates in ten European countries, all of which score
high or average on Transparency International’s corruption
perception index and where risks related to human rights are
assessed as low or medium by Verisk Maplecroft. In the learning
business, the business partners mainly include municipalities,
schools and teachers, while the media business is based on
creating and selling content to individual people, and selling
advertising space to companies. All Sanoma employees must
comply with Sanoma's Code of Conduct, which supports the
international standards on human rights and labour condi-
tions and clearly prohibits all corruption and bribery. The re-
quirements of the Code are extended to Sanoma’s suppliers
through the Supplier Code of Conduct. Sanoma mitigates the
compliance risk e.g. by a mandatory annual e-learning on the
Code of Conductto all employees. Due to the nature of Sanoma’s
business and the current situation in its operating countries,
no material risks related to human rights, anti-corruption or
bribery are likely to arise.

Financial risks

Sanoma is exposed to financial risks including interest rate,
currency, liquidity and credit risk. Other financial risks are re-
lated to equity and impairment of assets. Financial risks are
mitigated according to the Group's Treasury Policy e.g. with
various financial instruments and derivatives. Financial risk
management is centralised to Group Treasury, and aims at

25

Year 2019 Board of Directors’ Report

hedging the Group against material risks. A more detailed de-
scription of the Group's financial risks and their management
is available in Note 25.

Sanomo’s consolidated balance sheet included EUR 949 mil-
lion (2018: 1,186) of goodwill, immaterial rights and other in-
tangible assets at the end of December 2019. After the Iddink
acquisition, most of this is related to the learning business. In
accordance with IFRS, instead of goodwill being amortised reg-
ularly, it is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or when-
ever there is any indication of impairment. The impairment
losses on goodwill, immaterial rights and other immaterial
intangible assets for continuing and discontinued operations
totalled EUR 110 millionin 2019 (2018: 6). Changes in business
fundamentals could lead to further impairment, thus impacting
Sanomo's equity-related ratios.

More information on impairment testing is available in Note 12.

Significant near-term risks and
uncertainties

Sanomais exposed to numerous risks and opportunities, which
may arise from its own operations or the changing operating
environment. The most significant risks that could have a neg-
ative impact on Sanoma’s business, performance, or financial
status are described below. However, other currently unknown
orimmaterial risks may arise or become material in the future.

Sanoma's strategic aim is to grow through acquisitions. In M&A,
the key risks may relate to the availability of potential M&A tar-
gets, suitability of timing, transaction process, integration of the
acquired business, retention of key personnel, or achievement
of the targets set.

Many of Sanoma's identified strategic risks relate to changes in
customer preferences, which apply not only to the changes in
consumer behaviour, but also to the direct and indirect impacts
onchanges in B2B and public demand. Ongoing digitalisation
and mobilisation are the main drivers behind many of these
changes. In education, digital learning materials, methods and

Sanoma 2019

Financial Statements

platforms are gradually penetrating the market. The increasing
use of mobile devices is changing the way people consume
media, while viewing time of free-to-air TV is decreasing. New
entrants might be able to better utilise these changes and there-
fore gain market share from Sanomo’s established businesses.

Sanoma faces political risks in particular in Poland, where leg-
islative changes can have significant impacts on the learning
business. Changes in the Digital Single Market Initiative, ap-
proved by the EU Commission in the end of March 2019, could
have a significant impact on Sanoma’s cost efficient access to
high quality TV contentfor the Finnish market. Changes in taxa-
tion applied to Sanomo’s products and services in its operating
countries may have an impact on their demand.

The general economic conditions in Sanoma's operating coun-
tries and overall industry trends could influence Sanoma's busi-
ness activities and operational performance. General business
risks associated with the performance of the learning business
relate to development of public and private education spending
especially during the curriculum renewals. In the media busi-
ness, risks associated with business and financial performance
typically relate to advertising demand and consumer spending.
The volume of media advertising is especially sensitive to over-
all economic development and consumer confidence.

Data is an increasingly essential part of Sanoma's business put-
ting privacy and consumer trust atthe core of the Group's daily
operations. Sanoma has invested in data-security-related tech-
nologies and runs a Group-wide privacy programme to ensure
that employees know how to apply data security and privacy
practices in their daily work. Regulatory changes regarding
the use of customer and consumer data could have a negative
impact on Sanomo’s ability to to utilise data in its business.

Outlook for 2020

In 2020, Sanoma expects that the Group's comparable net sales
will be stable, and operational EBIT margin excl. PPA will be
around 15% (2019: 14.8%).

aims to pay an increasing dividend, equal to 40-60% of the
annual free cash flow. When proposing a dividend to the AGM,
the Board of Directors looks at the general macro-economic
environment, Sanoma’s current and target capital structure,
Sanomo’s future business plans and investment needs, as well
as both previous year’s cash flows and expected future cash
flows affecting capital structure.
