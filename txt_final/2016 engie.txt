1 SUMMARY OF THE GROUP'S RESULTS

After implementing its new organizational structure on January 1, 2016, ENGIE is rolling out its strategy to become the
world energy transition leader.

Although the Group continues to face a complex macro-economic and market environment, notably characterized by
significant commodity price volatility, its results for 2016 are strong and are already benefiting from the positive impact of
the Lean 2018 performance program.

Revenues fell by 4.6% on a reported basis to €66.6 billion compared with 2015 (down by 4.0% on an organic basis),
impacted by highly unfavorable exchange rate effects (€725 million negative impact) chiefly related to the pound sterling
and Brazilian real, partially offset by the positive impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (€210 million positive
impact). Besides these impacts, this decrease is mainly attributable to lower commodity prices which impacted the
LNG and gas midstream activities, gas and electricity retail businesses, exploration-production, and power generation
businesses, but only partially affected margins. The decrease was partially offset by the effect of slightly colder than
average temperatures in France in 2016 compared with a warm 2015.

EBITDA” amounted to €10.7 billion, down 5.2% on a reported basis and 2.7% on an organic basis. The decrease on a
reported basis is due to the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (€151 million negative impact) mainly relating
to the disposal of the merchant hydropower generation assets in the United States and to an unfavorable exchange rate
effect chiefly related to the Norwegian krone, Brazilian real and pound sterling. In 2016, on an organic basis, EBITDA
benefited from the restart of the Doel 3, Tihange 2 and Doel 1 nuclear power plants in Belgium in December 2015, the first
effects of the Lean 2018 performance program, the favorable temperature effect in France, and the impact of
commissioning of assets. These items only partially offset the continued decline in commodity prices.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method decreased
by 2.4% on a reported basis and increased by 1.6% on an organic basis to €6.2 billion. The organic decrease in EBITDA
was offset by the positive effect of lower depreciation and amortization charges as a result of impairment losses recorded
at end-2015 and the impact of reclassifying the portfolio of merchant power generation assets in the United States as
assets held for sale in 2015.

Net income/(loss) Group share represented a net loss of €0.4 billion in 2016, up €4.2 billion on the previous year.
It includes (i) lower net of tax impairment losses than in 2015, (ii) a positive change in the fair value of hedging contracts
related to electricity and gas purchases and sales, (iii) gains on the partial disposal of Transmisora Eléctrica del Norte
(TEN) in Chile, the disposal of the Paiton power plants in Indonesia and Meenakshi power plants in India, the disposal of
available-for-sale securities (Transportadora de Gas del Peru (TgP) in Peru and Ores Assets in Belgium) and
(iv) the impact of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate in France in 2020 introduced by the 2017 French Finance
Law. These items were partially offset by the negative impact of a decrease in the discount rate applied to provisions for
the back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle, and an increase in restructuring costs related mainly to the closure of plants in
Australia, France, Belgium and the United Kingdom.

Net recurring income Group share amounted to €2.5 billion, a decrease of €0.1 billion compared with 2015, in line with
the decline in current operating income after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method.

Cash flow from operations (CFFO) amounted to €9.7 billion, broadly stable compared to 2015 despite the decrease in
cash generated from operations before income tax and working capital requirements.

Net debt stood at €24.8 billion, down €2.9 billion compared with net debt at December 31, 2015, mainly due to cash flow
from operations (€9.7 billion) and the initial effects of the portfolio rotation program (€4.0 billion), and particularly
(i) the disposal of the merchant hydropower generation assets portfolio in the United States, (ii) the disposal of thermal
power generation assets in Indonesia and India, (iii) the disposal of wind farms operated by Maia Eolis to Futures Energies

(1) Data at December 31, 2016 are presented according to the Group’s new EBITDA definition. This now excludes the non-recurring
portion of the net income of entities accounted for using the equity method, which amounted to €12 million in 2015.

Investissements Holding (FEIH), a 50/50 joint venture with Crédit Agricole Assurances, (iv) the disposal of available-for-
sale securities (Ores Assets in Belgium and TgP in Peru) and (v) the partnership established as part of the TEN project,
which led to the disposal of 50% of the holding in TEN in Chile. These items were partially offset by (i) gross investments
in the period (€7.3 billion), (ii) and dividends paid to ENGIE SA shareholders (€2.4 billion) and to non-controlling interests
(€0.5 billion).

2 OUTLOOK

OUTLOOK

Since 2016, the Group is committed to a 3 year transformation plan aiming at creating value and at improving the
Group’s risk profile. This plan which is very well advanced today, is based on 3 main programs:

the portfolio rotation program (€15 billion net debt impact targeted over 2016-2018). The Group has announced
to date €8.0 billion of disposals (i.e. more than 50% of total program), of which €7.2 billion already finalized
today;

the investment program (€16 billion growth capex over 2016-2018), of which €4.7 billion® are already invested
at end December 2016;

the performance plan Lean 2018. Thanks to significant progress made, the Group decides to raise its
objective 2018 by 20%, i.e. €1.2 billion of net gains recorded at EBITDA level by 2018. At end December 2016,
€530 million of net gains at EBITDA were achieved, which is higher than the annual 2016 target of €500 million.

For 2017, the Group anticipates a net recurring income Group share between €2.4 and €2.6 billion, in strong organic
growth compared to 2016. This guidance is based on an estimated range for EBITDA of €10.7 to 11.3 billion, also
growing strongly organically.

For the 2017-2018 period, the Group anticipates:

a net debt/EBITDA ratio below or equal to 2.5x; and
an «A» category credit rating.

For fiscal year 2016, the Group confirms the payment of a €1 per share dividend, payable in cash.

For fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the Group commits to pay a €0.70 per share dividend per year, payable in cash.

(1) To date, including the disposal of US thermal merchant assets in February 2017.

(2) Including capex on innovation and digital.

(3) These targets and indication assume average weather conditions in France, full pass through of supply costs in French regulated gas
tariffs, and unchanged Group accounting principles for supply and logistic gas contracts, no significant regulatory and macro-economic
changes, commodity price assumptions based on market conditions as of December 31, 2016 for the non-hedged part of the
production, and average foreign exchange rates as follows for 2017: €/$: 1.07; €/BRL: 3.54. These financial objectives include the
impact of the Belgian nuclear contribution on EBITDA but do not consider significant impacts on disposals not already announced.

Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to €66.6 billion, down 4.6% compared with the
previous year. On an organic basis (excluding the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and exchange rates),
revenues fell by 4.0%.

Changes in the scope of consolidation had a net positive €210 million impact resulting from (i) acquisitions made in 2015
and 2016 for €612 million, mainly OpTerra Energy Services in the United States (€241 million) and services companies
operating in Australia and New Zealand (€137 million), (ii) disposals or deconsolidation of business activities in 2015 or
2016 for €402 million, including the disposal of the retail businesses in Hungary (€209 million negative impact) and
merchant hydropower generation assets in the United States (€88 million negative impact). Exchange rates had a negative
impact of €725 million on Group revenues, mainly reflecting the appreciation of the euro against the pound sterling,
Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Norwegian krone.

Organic revenue performance was severely affected by lower commodity prices in the gas and LNG midstream, retail,
exploration-production and power generation activities. Although these price effects had a significant impact on revenues,
their impact on margins was more limited, particularly in the retail businesses. As a result, organic revenue for the Group’s
segments was up in Infrastructures Europe, Benelux, and Europe excluding France & Benelux, stable in France, Latin
America and North America, down slightly in the Other segment, and down significantly in Africa/Asia, E&P and
GEM & LNG.

EBITDA declined by 5.2% to €10.7 billion over the year. Excluding the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation
and exchange rates, EBITDA decreased by 2.7%.

Changes in the scope of consolidation had a negative €151 million impact on EBITDA and chiefly resulted from the disposal
of merchant hydropower generation assets in the United States, coupled with the impact of the disposal or recognition as
assets held for sale of some entities accounted for using the equity method. Changes in exchange rates had a negative
€136 million impact, mainly due to the appreciation of the euro against the Norwegian krone, Brazilian real and pound
sterling.

On an organic basis, EBITDA was down 2.7%, or €298 million. It benefited from the positive impact of (i) the effects of the
Lean 2018 performance program, (ii) the restart of the Doel 3, Tihange 2 and Doel 1 nuclear power plants in Belgium in
December 2015, (iii) a positive temperature effect in France, (iv) the favorable impact of a provision reversal (in the Latin
America segment), and (v) the commissioning of assets in the Latin America, Africa/Asia and E&P segments. However,
these positive impacts only partially offset (i) negative price effects, mainly in the exploration-production, midstream gas
and LNG, and power generation businesses, (ii) the impact of positive one-off items recognized in 2015, and
(iii) unfavorable volume effects, particularly in the exploration-production and storage businesses in France.

Organic EBITDA performance varied significantly between segments:

e EBITDA for North America and Africa/Asia was down due to unfavorable price effects affecting margins of power
generation assets (notably in North America, Thailand, Singapore and India), and the lower availability of coal
assets in Australia. These impacts were partially offset by good cost control and the favorable impact of
commissioning assets in South Africa;

e EBITDA for Latin America was up sharply on an organic basis, driven by the commissioning of the Mayakan gas
pipeline extension in Mexico, the Quitaracsa and Nodo Energetico power generation assets in Peru and the full
commissioning of the Jirau hydroelectric power plant in Brazil. Brazil also benefited from the favorable impact of
a provision reversal;

MANAGEMENT REPORT
3 CONSOLIDATED REVENUES AND EARNINGS

e EBITDA for Benelux was up sharply, driven by the positive impact of the restart of the Doel 3, Tihange 2 and Doel 1
nuclear power plants at end-2015, which was partially offset by the deterioration in EBITDA from the services
business, particularly in Oil & Gas;

e EBITDA for France improved due to a positive temperature effect on gas sales, a rise in electricity volumes sold,
and a good performance in the network business. These increases were partially offset by the fall in electricity
prices captured by the hydro generation business and difficulties in gas sales to business customers;

e — growth in EBITDA in Europe excluding France and Benelux was driven by an improved performance from services
(particularly in the United Kingdom) and from energy sales in Italy, partially offset by the adverse impact of new
gas distribution tariffs in Romania;

e EBITDA for Infrastructures Europe increased due to the positive temperature effect and tariff increases in
distribution and transportation;

e EBITDA for the GEM & LNG segment declined due to greater revisions to gas supply conditions in 2015 than in
2016 and the discontinuance of shipments from Yemen since April 2015;

e EBITDA for exploration-production activities was down due to the fall in the market prices of oil and gas, coupled
with a decrease in hydrocarbon production due notably to the outages at Njord and Hyme since June 2016;

e EBITDA for the Other segment was down on an organic basis mainly due to the positive impact of one-off items
recorded in 2015 and a contraction in engineering activities, which were only partially offset by a good operating
performance from thermal power generation activities in Europe.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method amounted to
€6.2 billion, up 1.6% on an organic basis compared with 2015. Changes in this indicator for each segment reflect EBITDA
trends, plus the positive impact of reduced depreciation and amortization charges as a result of the impairment losses
recorded at end-2015 and the impact of reclassifying the portfolio of merchant power generation assets in the United States
as assets held for sale.

Revenues for the North America segment totaled €3,814 million, up 3.9% on a reported basis. Revenues were down
0.5% on an organic basis due to lower generation volumes and prices, partly mitigated by higher retail volumes.
The change on a reported basis also factored in the scope impact of the acquisition of OpTerra Energy Services in
February 2016 and the disposal of the merchant hydropower generation assets in June 2016.

Electricity sales decreased by 2.9 TWh to 65.8 TWh due to lower US generation volumes, primarily a consequence of
weaker wholesale commodity prices, but were also impacted by the disposal mentioned above. US retail sales volumes
increased, offsetting some of the reduction in generation volumes.

EBITDA totaled €475 million, down 25.0% on a reported basis but down only 11.8% organically. The organic decline
resulted primarily from lower margins in the US generation business, partly mitigated by a stronger performance in the
US retail business coupled with cost savings. The segment’s reported results were negatively impacted by the disposal of
the merchant hydropower generation assets and the reclassification of some entities accounted for using the equity method
as assets held for sale.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method amounted to
€430 million, up 29.4% on a reported basis and up 61.3% on an organic basis, due to the positive impact on depreciation
and amortization of both the accounting treatment of assets held for sale and the impairment losses recognized in 2015.

Revenues for the Latin America segment totaled €4,075 million, representing a 2.9% decrease on a reported basis,
impacted by the depreciation of the Brazilian real and Mexican peso, and a 0.2% organic increase.

In Brazil, the impact of inflation on average prices under bilateral agreements failed to offset the impact of the very high
spot prices which had boosted 2015 performance. Peru trended upwards thanks to the commissioning of the Quitaracsa
hydroelectric power plant (October 2015) and the Nodo Energetico thermal power plant (October 2016). Mexico was
positively impacted by the commissioning of the Mayakan gas pipeline extension (April 2015) and by distributed gas
volumes and tariff increases. In Chile, the decrease in commodity prices affected selling prices.

Electricity sales decreased by 0.7 TWh to 59.3 TWh and gas sales increased by 3.9 TWh to 30.4 TWh.

EBITDA totaled €1,696 million, an increase of 8.5% on a reported basis and 12% on an organic basis, despite the negative
impact of the depreciation of the Brazilian real and Mexican peso. The 12% organic growth was due to the positive impact
of a provision reversal in Brazil, and by a stronger performance in Peru and Mexico, partially offset by weaker results in
Chile.

Revenues for the Africa/Asia segment totaled €3,804 million, down 10.4% on a reported basis and 12.1% organically.
In respect of changes in the scope of consolidation, the contribution of the Australian and New Zealand services activities
acquired at end-2015 more than offset the negative foreign exchange impact, mainly due to the strengthening of the euro
against the Thai baht and Turkish lira as well as the impact of the sale of the Meenakshi coal-fired power plant in India in
September 2016. The organic decline resulted from a combination of lower generation volumes and reduced cost pass-
through (gas and coal costs to electricity sale prices) in Thailand and Turkey.

Electricity sales decreased by 3.8 TWh to 51 TWh, with reduced volumes in Thailand and Australia.

EBITDA totaled €1,162 million, down 6.1% on a reported basis and 4.6% organically, mainly reflecting the reduced
availability of the coal-fired assets in Australia and lower margins in Thailand, Singapore and India, partially offset by cost
savings achieved under the Lean 2018 performance program and by the power generation assets commissioned in
South Africa (Avon, West Coast and Dedisa).

Current operating income after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method amounted to
€923 million, down 1.7% on an organic basis primarily for the same reasons as those given above for EBITDA. It was also
favorably impacted by lower depreciation and amortization charges due to the impairment losses recognized at end-2015.

basis compared to 2015. This rise reflects the restart of the Doel 1, Doel 3 and Tihange 2 nuclear power plants at the end
of 2015. It was partly offset by a decrease in selling prices (no margin impact) on the gas retail business and by the fall in
revenues from services businesses, notably in the Oil & Gas business.

Revenues for the France segment amounted to €20,332 million, up slightly by 0.4% on a reported basis and by 0.2%
organically. The increase was driven by growth in electricity sales to both BtoB and BtoC customers coupled with a positive
temperature effect on gas sales, partially offset by a decrease in the number of customers and in selling prices.

Natural gas sales were up 4.0 TWh, comprising a positive 8.8 TWh temperature effect and a negative 4.8 TWh impact
from the loss of customers due to competitive pressure. ENGIE holds around 74% of the BtoC market and around 25% of
the BtoB market. Electricity sales were up 6.0 TWh compared to 2015 and continued to advance in terms of sales to end
customers (up 2.1 TWh), sales to business customers (up 2.5 TWh) and production of renewable energy (up 1.4 TWh).

EBITDA amounted to €1,315 million, up 4.3% on an organic basis, led by a good performance from the heating networks
business and BtoB services, a rise in electricity volumes sold to BtoB and BtoC customers and in power renewable
generation, as well as good cost control. These impacts were partly offset by the fall in prices and volumes of gas sold to
business customers.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method amounted to
€695 million, up 2.8% on an organic basis in line with organic EBITDA growth.

Revenues for the Europe excluding France and Benelux segment totaled €8,118 million, down 4.4% on a reported basis
reflecting the foreign exchange impact (mainly due to the depreciation of the pound sterling) combined with the disposal
of retail activities in Hungary in September 2015. Revenues were up 1.9% organically, mainly due to favorable weather
conditions in Romania which more than offset the lower gas distribution tariffs in Romania, coupled with growth in revenues
from the services business.

Electricity sales were up 1.1 TWh to 29.1 TWh. Gas sales fell by 6.3 TWh to 68.2 TWh, mainly due to the disposal of the

Global Energy Management (GEM) and LNG’s contribution to Group revenues in 2016 amounted to €8,981 million, down
20.7% compared to 2015. This decrease was mainly due the drop in commodity prices in Europe and Asia since 2015.

External LNG sales were stable at 81 TWh, representing 108 cargoes.

EBITDA was down on 2015 to €3 million, due mostly to the recognition of profits relating to the revised gas supply
conditions introduced in 2015, which were higher than in 2016, and to the discontinuance of shipments from Yemen as
from April 2015. The impacts were partially offset by LNG sale opportunities in Asia in the fourth quarter of 2016 and by
the significant gains generated as a result of the Lean 2018 performance program.

The business incurred a current operating loss after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity
method of €74 million in 2016, representing a deterioration on both a reported and organic basis, in line with EBITDA.

The contribution of E&P to Group revenues amounted to €1,799 million in 2016, down 19.8% on a reported basis and
17.8% on an organic basis, mainly due to the slump in oil and gas prices and a 2.8 Mbep decrease in total hydrocarbon
production (56.3 Mbep in 2016 versus 59.1 Mbep in 2015), due to outages at Njord and Hyme in Norway in early June,
partially offset by a good performance from other assets and the final impacts of the commissioning of Gudrun.
Exchange rate differences account for the remainder of the reported decrease in revenues.

MANAGEMENT REPORT
4 REPORTABLE SEGMENT BUSINESS TRENDS

EBITDA amounted to €1,198 million, down 20.9% on a reported basis or 18.9% on an organic basis, in line with revenue
trends. The decline in EBITDA was partially offset by a sharp decrease in extraction and exploration costs.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method amounted to
€536 million in 2016, down 1.8% on a reported basis and down 0.2% on an organic basis, as the decrease in EBITDA was
largely offset by lower depreciation and amortization charges due to the impairment losses recorded at end-2015 and by
lower charges in respect of pre-capitalized exploration costs.

The Other segment comprises the activities of the Generation Europe, Tractebel and GTT business units, as well as the
Group’s holding and corporate activities, which notably include the entities centralizing the Group's financing requirements,
Solairedirect’s business and the equity-accounted contribution of SUEZ.

Revenues amounted to €3,405 million, down 8.2% on a reported basis and down 6.7% organically. The negative foreign
exchange impact relating to the pound sterling was partially offset by the positive contributions from newly-consolidated
acquisitions, including Solairedirect. The organic decrease was mainly due to the closure of the coal-fired power plants at
Rugeley (1 GW) in early June 2016 and Gelderland (0.6 GW) at end-2015 and the Twinerg gas-fired power plant (0.4 GW)
in June 2016.

Electricity sales amounted to 21.6 TWh, representing a decrease of 0.5 TWh compared to 2015. The closures of Rugeley,
Gelderland and Twinerg were offset by an increase in production mainly at the gas-fired power plants in the Netherlands.

EBITDA amounted to €15 million, down on both a reported and organic basis compared to 2015, due to the positive one-off
items recorded in 2015 (including damages and late payment interest received in relation to two coal-fired power plant
projects in Germany and the Netherlands) and a contraction in Tractebel’s engineering business, notwithstanding an
improved performance from thermal power generation activities due notably to the commissioning of Wilhelmshaven in
October 2015.

Current operating loss after share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method was €472 million
for the period, representing a deterioration on both reported and organic basis, in line with EBITDA trends.

Income from operating activities amounted to €2,452 million, up compared to 2015 due mainly to (i) lower impairment
losses compared to the previous year, (ii) the positive impact of the change in fair value of commodity derivatives, and
(iii) gains on disposals of assets and available-for-sale securities, partially offset by (iv) the fall in current operating income
after share in net income of companies accounted for using the equity method, and (v) by the recognition of additional
costs relating to the three-yearly revision of nuclear provisions in Belgium, to the dismantling and rehabilitation of the
Hazelwood power plant and adjacent coal mine in Australia, and to restructuring plans initiated by the Group under
its transformation program.

In 2016, the Group recognized impairment losses of €1,690 million against goodwill, €2,485 million against property, plant
and equipment and intangible assets, and €147 million against financial assets and investments in entities accounted for
using the equity method. These impairment losses related mainly to the Benelux, GEM & LNG, France and North America
reportable segments. After taking into account the deferred tax effects and the share of impairment losses attributable to
non-controlling interests, the impact of these impairment losses on net income Group share was a negative €3,866 million.
These impairment losses are described in Note 8.2 “Impairment losses” to the consolidated financial statements.

In 2015, the Group recognized impairment losses of €2,628 million against goodwill, €5,731 million against property, plant
and equipment and intangible assets, and €402 million against financial assets and investments in entities accounted for
using the equity method. These impairment losses related mainly to the E&P, GEM & LNG, Africa/Asia, North America and
France reportable segments.

Income from operating activities was also affected by:

e changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives relating to operating items, which had a positive impact of
€1,254 million on income from operating activities (reflecting the impact of transactions not eligible for hedge
accounting), compared with a negative impact of €261 million in 2015. The impact for the period results chiefly
from positive overall price effects on these positions, combined with the net positive impact of unwinding positions
with a negative market value at December 31, 2015;

e — restructuring costs of €476 million (compared with €265 million the previous year) including notably (i) costs related
to decisions to shut down production and close some entities, sites and power plants for €230 million and (ii) costs
related to various staff reduction plans implemented as part of the Group’s transformation program, as well as
measures to adapt to economic conditions for €154 million;

e changes in the scope of consolidation (gains and losses on disposals of consolidated entities or remeasurements
of previously-held interests in accordance with IFRS 3), which had a positive impact of €544 million, including gains
on the disposal of the Group’s entire 40.5% interest in the Paiton coal-fired power plants in Indonesia for
€225 million, the disposal of a 50% interest in Transmisora Eléctrica del Norte (TEN) in Chile for €211 million, and
the disposal of the 89.9% interest in the Meenakshi coal-fired power plants in India for €84 million (see Note 4.1);

5 OTHER INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS

e other non-recurring items representing a loss of €850 million, mainly including the €584 million net expense related
to additions to provisions for the back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle under the three-yearly revision of nuclear
provisions in Belgium (see Note 18.2), as well as a €124 million expense corresponding to the recognition of
additional dismantling and rehabilitation costs for the Hazelwood power plant and adjacent coal mine in Australia
following the shut-down and rehabilitation plan approved by the shareholders at the end of 2016.

The Group's net financial loss narrowed to €1,380 million in 2016 from €1,547 million in 2015, owing to the fall in the cost
of gross debt and lower non-recurring expenses compared to 2015.

The income tax charge amounted to €909 million in 2016 (€324 million in 2015). It includes an income tax benefit of
€824 million arising on non-recurring income statement items (versus €1,110 million in 2015), mainly related to the
remeasurement of deferred taxes recognized by the French entities at the new rate of 28.92% provided for in the
2017 French Finance Law (€904 million), and to the impairment losses recognized against property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets in 2016 (€326 million). Adjusted for these non-recurring items, the effective recurring tax rate was
41.9%, higher than the 2015 rate of 39.0% due mainly to the impacts of the reversal of tax litigation provisions in 2015.

Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was up year-on-year at €579 million due mainly to the impact of the
capital gain on the disposal of a 50% interest in Transmisora Eléctrica del Norte (TEN) which affected the net income of
the Group's 53%-owned subsidiary ENGIE Energia Chile, as well as improved income from exploration-production
activities and in Australia.

6 CHANGES IN NET DEBT

Net debt stood at €24.8 billion, down €2.9 billion compared with net debt at December 31, 2015, mainly due to cash flow
from operations (€9.7 billion) and the initial effects of the portfolio rotation program (€4.0 billion), and particularly
(i) the disposal of the merchant hydro generation assets portfolio in the United States, (ii) the disposal of thermal power
generation assets in Indonesia and India, (iii) the disposal of wind farms operated by Maia Eolis to Futures Energies
Investissements Holding (FEIH), a 50/50 joint venture with Crédit Agricole Assurances, (iv) the disposal of available-for-
sale securities (Ores Assets in Belgium and TgP in Peru) and (v) the partnership established as part of the TEN project,
which led to the disposal of 50% of the holding in TEN in Chile. These items were partially offset by (i) gross investments
in the period (€7.3 billion), (ii) and dividends paid to ENGIE SA shareholders (€2.4 billion) and to non-controlling interests
(€0.5 billion).

The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets was €64.4 billion, up €0.4 billion on
December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of capital expenditure during the year (€6.1 billion positive
impact), other changes (€1.0 billion positive impact, relating mainly to an increase in dismantling assets recorded against
the increase in provisions for dismantling nuclear facilities in Belgium), translation adjustments (€0.6 billion positive impact),
partially offset by depreciation and amortization charges (€4.4 billion negative impact) and impairment losses (€2.5 billion
negative impact).

Goodwill decreased by €1.7 billion to €17.4 billion, mainly due to the recognition of impairment losses.

Total equity amounted to €45.5 billion, a decrease of €3.3 billion compared to December 31, 2015. This decrease results
essentially from the payment of cash dividends (€2.9 billion negative impact) and other comprehensive income (€0.5 billion
negative impact, chiefly relating to actuarial differences and net investment and cash flow hedges net of tax, partially offset
by translation adjustments).

Provisions amounted to €22.2 billion, an increase of €3.4 billion compared to December 31, 2015. This increase stems
mainly from the impact of the revision to provisions for dismantling nuclear facilities (€1.1 billion positive impact), actuarial
losses on provisions for post-employment benefits (€0.7 billion positive impact) owing to the fall in discount rates in the
period, and the impact of unwinding the discount on the provisions (€0.6 billion positive impact).

8 PARENT COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The figures provided below relate to the financial statements of ENGIE SA, prepared in accordance with French GAAP
and applicable regulations.

Revenues for ENGIE SA in 2016 totaled €17,939 million, down 10% on 2015 due mainly to the impact of lower gas sales,
partly offset by an upturn in electricity activity.

The Company posted a net operating loss of €1,252 million versus a net operating loss of €744 million in 2015, chiefly
reflecting the decrease in the energy margin and the increase in other external expenses excluding infrastructure costs.

The Company reported net financial income of €1,294 million compared with €1,089 million in 2015. This mainly includes
dividends received from subsidiaries for €2,043 million versus €2,055 million in 2015, and the cost of debt which decreased
slightly to €744 million, chiefly consisting of the interest expense on bond issues.

Net non-recurring expenses amounted to €266 million, chiefly due to the combined effect of litigation provisions (expense
of €190 million), impairment losses on a contractual intangible asset as well as miscellaneous expenses relating to
restructuring transactions. The additional non-recurring expense was mainly related to net impairment losses on securities
(€54 million) and special depreciation allowances (€39 million).

The income tax benefit amounted to €672 million compared to a benefit of €540 million in 2015. These two amounts
included a tax consolidation benefit of €405 million and €350 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Net income for the year came out at €448 million.
Shareholders’ equity amounted to €37,976 million at end-2016, versus €39,903 million at December 31, 2015, mainly
reflecting the cash dividend payout. Distributable profit and capacity amounted to respectively €1,941 million and

€34,741 million.

At December 31, 2016, net debt stood at €30,709 million, and cash and cash equivalents totaled €5,075 million (of which
€3,077 million relating to affiliates current accounts).

Information relating to supplier payment deadlines

The law in favor of the modernization of the economy (“LME” law No. 2008-776 of August 4, 2008) and its implementing
decree (No. 2008-1492 of December 30, 2008), provide that companies whose annual financial statements are certified
by a Statutory Auditor must publish information regarding supplier payment deadlines. The purpose of publishing this

information is to demonstrate that there are no significant delays in the payment of suppliers.
