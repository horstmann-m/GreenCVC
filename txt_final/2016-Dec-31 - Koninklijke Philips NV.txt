separation of Lighting has delivered two winning companies
and a significant improvement in Group performance. Our
net income more than doubled to EUR 1.5 billion while our
income from operations increased to EUR 1.9 billion from
EUR 1.0 billion in the previous year. Improved earnings and
tight management of working capital generated EUR 1.9
billion of cash from our operating activities.”

compared to EUR 559 million and EUR 293 million
respectively in 2015.

The above costs are reported in Income from
operations except for the net interest cost component
which is reported in Financial expense. The net interest
cost for defined-benefit plans was EUR 66 million in
2016 (2015: EUR 72 million)

2016 included a legal claim settlement gain of EUR 46
million related to the UK pension plan, a EUR 8 million
settlement gain related to de-risking actions in the US
and a combined settlement loss of EUR 2 million in
other countries. Past-service cost gains of EUR 8 million
were recognized in 2016 relating to a number of small
plan changes.

2015 included settlement costs of EUR 329 million
mainly related to the settlement of the UK plan, results
of other de-risking actions in the UK prior to the
settlement and the settlement of parts of the US
pension plan. Past-service costs of EUR 14 million were
recognized related to de-risking actions taken in the UK
prior to the settlement of the plan, including a past-
service cost for GMP Equalization in the same UK plan.
Some smaller plan changes in other countries resulted
in a small past-service cost gain.

In 2015, the total costs of post-employment benefits
amounted to EUR 559 million for defined-benefit plans
and EUR 293 million for defined-contribution plans,
compared to EUR 241 million and EUR 144 million

The overall funded status improved in 2016, mainly due
to contributions of EUR 250 million in the US, partly
offset by an increase of the defined-benefit obligation
due to lower discount rates. The pension deficit
recognized in the balance sheet decreased for the same
reasons.

Income taxes

Income taxes amounted to EUR 327 million, compared
to EUR 239 million in 2015. The effective income tax rate
in 2016 was 23.5%, compared to 38.4% in 2015. The
decrease was largely due to a change in the
geographical mix of actual profits and one-off tax
benefits in 2016 mainly relating to recognition of
deferred tax assets.

For 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be around
30%. However, the actual rate will depend on the
geographical mix of profits.

For further information, refer to note 8, Income taxes.

Results of investments in associates

Results related to investments in associates decreased
from a gain of EUR 30 million in 2015 to a gain of EUR
13 million in 2016, mainly reflecting the proceeds from
the sale of Assembléon Technologies B.V. in 2015.

For further information, refer to note 5, Interests in

Non-controlling interests

Net income attributable to non-controlling interests
increased from EUR 14 million in 2015 to EUR 43 million
in 2016, mainly as a result of the sale of the 28.775%
minority interest in Philips Lighting

Discontinued operations

Discontinued operations consist primarily of the
combined businesses of Lumileds and Automotive, the
Audio, Video, Multimedia & Accessories business, and
certain divestments formerly reported as Discontinued
operations. The results related to these businesses are
reported under Discontinued operations in the
Consolidated statements of income and Consolidated
statements of cash flows

In 2014, Philips announced the start of the process to
combine the Lumileds and Automotive Lighting
businesses into a stand-alone company and explore
strategic options to attract capital from third-party
investors for this combined business.

In January 2016, Philips announced that the transaction
with Go Scale Capital had been terminated despite
efforts to mitigate the concerns of the Committee on
Foreign Investment in the United States (‘CFIUS’).

Philips announced December 12, 2016 that it has signed
an agreement to sell an 80.1% interest in Lumileds, a
leading supplier of LED components and automotive

In 2016, income from Discontinued operations
increased by EUR 171 million to EUR 416 million. The
year-on-year increase was mainly due to improved
results of the combined Lumileds and Automotive
businesses, which were driven by higher sales and
improvements in Gross margin, and the Funai
arbitration award of EUR 144 million, which includes
disbursements and interest as compensation for
damages.

In 2015, income from Discontinued operations
increased by EUR 55 million to EUR 245 million. The
year-on-year increase was mainly due to the positive
impact from the treatment of depreciation and
amortization of assets held for sale of the combined
Lumileds and Automotive businesses.

For further information, refer to note 3, Discontinued
operations and other assets classified as held for sale.

Net income

Net income increased from EUR 659 million in 2015 to
EUR 1,491 million in 2016. The increase was largely due
to higher income from operations (EBIT) of EUR 890
million and net income from Discontinued operations
of EUR 171 million, partly offset by higher financial
charges of EUR 124 million, higher income tax charges
of EUR 88 million and EUR 17 million lower net income
from investments in associates.

Basic earnings per common share from net income
attributable to shareholders increased from EUR 0.70
per common share in 2015 to EUR 1.58 per common
share in 2016.

Acquisitions and divestments

In 2016, Philips completed two acquisitions, the largest
being Wellcentive, a leading US-based provider of

healthcare company. Acquisitions in 2014 and prior
years led to post-merger integration charges of EUR 1
million in the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, EUR 1
million in the Personal Health businesses and EUR 19
million in Lighting.

In 2016, total debt decreased by EUR 154 million
compared to 2015. New borrowings of EUR 1,304 million
were mainly due to new loan facilities for Philips
Lighting of EUR 740 million and USD 500 million to
replace intragroup financing from Royal Philips.
Repayments amounted to EUR 1,681 million, mainly
due to the repayment of a USD 1,300 million bridge loan
used for the Volcano acquisition, as well as the early
redemption of USD 285 million in aggregate principal
amount of USD bonds. Other changes resulting from
consolidation and currency effects led to an increase of
EUR 223 million.

In 2015, total debt increased by EUR 1,656 million. New
borrowings of EUR 1,335 million were mainly due to a
short-term bridging loan with low interest rate used for
the Volcano acquisition, while repayments amounted
to EUR 104 million. Other changes resulting from
consolidation and currency effects led to an increase of
EUR 425 million:

At the end of 2016, long-term debt as a proportion of

Shareholders’ equity

Shareholders’ equity increased by EUR 939 million in
2016 to EUR 12,601 million at December 31, 2016. The

income, partially offset by EUR 589 million related to
the purchase of shares for the share buy-back program.
The dividend payment to shareholders of Koninklijke
Philips N.V. in 2016 reduced equity by EUR 330 million
including tax and service charges, while the delivery of
treasury shares increased equity by EUR 74 million.

The number of outstanding common shares of Royal
Philips at December 31, 2016 was 922 million (2015: 917
million). At the end of 2016, the Company held 7.2

Royal Philips has a EUR 1.8 billion committed revolving
credit facility that can be used for general group
purposes and as a backstop of its Commercial Paper
Programme and will mature in February 2018. The
Commercial Paper Programme amounts to USD 2.5
billion, under which Royal Philips can issue commercial
paper up to 364 days in tenor, both in the US and in
Europe, in any major freely convertible currency. There
is a panel of banks, in Europe and in the US, which
service the program. The interest is at market rates
prevailing at the time of issuance of the commercial
paper. There is no collateral requirement in the
Commercial Paper Programme. Also, there are no
limitations on Philips’ use of funds from the program. As
of December 31, 2016, Royal Philips did not have any
loans outstanding under these facilities.

Royal Philips’ existing long-term debt is rated Baal
(with stable outlook) by Moody’s and BBB+ (with stable
outlook) by Standard & Poor's. Our net debt” position is
managed in such a way that we expect to retain a strong
investment grade credit rating. Furthermore, the
Group’s aim when managing the net debt” position is
dividend stability and a pay-out ratio of 40% to 50% of
continuing net income. Royal Philips’ outstanding long-
term debt and credit facilities do not contain financial
covenants or cross-acceleration provisions that are
based on adverse changes in ratings. A description of
Philips’ credit facilities, including any covenants, can be
found in note 18, Debt.

As at December 31, 2016, Philips had total cash and
cash equivalents of EUR 2,334 million. Philips pools
cash from subsidiaries to the extent legally and
economically feasible. Cash not pooled remains
available for local operational or investment needs.

Philips believes its current liquidity and direct access to
capital markets is sufficient to meet its present financing
requirements.

In December 2016, Royal Philips delivered a notice of
redemption to the holders of the outstanding 5.750%
Notes due 2018 in the aggregate principal amount of
USD 1,250 million for redemption in January 2017. For

rooted in innovation, R&D and entrepreneurship. We
strive to hire employees with backgrounds and
perspectives that can mirror the diversity of our markets
and customers, fueling insight and innovation across
our business.

During 2016 we successfully split Philips Lighting from
Royal Philips. This facilitated greater focus and growth
in each business, but also necessitated change and
adjustment for our people. Throughout this process, our
people have demonstrated their significant
professionalism in making this a smooth transition, from
both a people and business perspective, ensuring
moments of uncertainty were supported with care.

Improving people’s lives

At Philips, we strive to make the world healthier and
more sustainable through innovation. Our goal is to
improve the lives of 3 billion people a year by 2025. To
guide our efforts and measure our progress, we take a
two-dimensional approach — social and ecological — to
improving people's lives. Solutions from our portfolio
that directly support the curative or preventive side of
people’s health determine the contribution to the social
dimension. This is also our contribution to the UN
Sustainable Development Goal 3 (“to ensure healthy
lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”). As
healthy ecosystems are also needed for people to live
a healthy life, the contribution to the ecological
dimension is determined by means of our steadily
growing Green Solutions portfolio, such as our energy-
efficient products in our Personal Health businesses.
This is our contribution to Sustainable Development
Goal 12 (“to ensure sustainable consumption and
production patterns”).

Through Philips products and solutions that support
people's health, we improved the lives of 908 million
people in 2016, driven by our Diagnosis & Treatment
businesses and Connected Care & Health Informatics
businesses. Additionally, our products that help people
live a healthy life improved the lives of 324 million
people, and our Green Solutions that contribute to a
healthy ecosystem 1.74 billion people. After the
elimination of double counts — people touched
multiple times — we arrived at 2.1 billion lives. This is an
increase of around 100 million compared to 2015,
driven by all segments, mainly in Greater China, North
America, ASEAN, and the Indian subcontinent.

Including, engaging and inspiring our people
The ability to capture growth and seize market
opportunities depends on our people — their alignment
with our vision, a sense of common purpose, and the
belief that their role at Philips is making a positive
contribution.

Inclusion and Diversity

Philips recognizes that the best and most innovative
solutions are generated through collaboration between
people who think differently from one another and
genuinely welcome a variety of ideas and viewpoints.

valued. The conviction that all individuals should be
treated fairly and respectfully, have equal access to
opportunities and resources, and can contribute fully to
our success.

Hiring and acquiring our people

In 2016, over 10,000 people were appointed to roles
within Philips; 69% of executive vacancies were filled
by internal candidates, the remainder were external
hires with 60% coming from other healthcare or IT
companies. In line with previous years, roughly one
third of all roles were filled with internal candidates and
the remainder filled with highly qualified external
talent.

Three successful integrations were completed in 2016,
Volcano, PathXL and Wellcentive, also infusing the
organization with additional talent with deep health
technology expertise.

Philips’ focus on health technology has enabled
activation of more highly targeted recruitment
campaigns and outreach efforts. As such, Philips has
continued to strengthen in-house talent acquisition
capabilities, completing 80% of Executive hires in 2016,
and saving EUR 3 million in agency costs.

Recruitment campaigns have been customized to raise
awareness and attractiveness of Philips as a top
healthcare technology employer within critical talent
segments, for example Software and Q&R. The Code to
Care campaign achieved 340,000 prospects to the
software careers page, supporting 77% growth in digital
talent pipelines. Likewise the Quality Gene campaign
resulted in a 35% increase in applications, and a 39%
increase in Q&R hires from strategically targeted
companies.

In 2016, Philips was recognized as the best-in-class in
talent acquisition by Corporate Executive Board and is
in the top 1% of LinkedIn top global talent attractors. In
addition, Best Place to Work programs helped Philips
boost attractiveness to passive talent in the labor
market in 2016, winning category awards in the United
States, Netherlands, Germany, Spain, and Panama.

Employment

The total number of Philips Group employees
(continuing operations) was 105,223 at the end of 2016,
compared to 104,204 at the end of 2015. Approximately
33% were employed in the Lighting segment, 23% in the
Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, 21% in the Personal
Health businesses, 13% in the HealthTech Other
segment and 10% in the Connected Care & Health
Informatics businesses.

The increase reflects insourced manufacturing for
products with critical process capability requirements,
increased resources in digital innovation across
marketing and software, and growth through
acquisition. This targeted growth was partially offset by
industrial footprint rationalization at Lighting, a
reduction of traditional sales roles, and a decrease in
operational headcount in central functions.

Approximately 53% of the Philips workforce was
located in mature geographies, and about 47% in
growth geographies. In 2016, the number of employees
in mature geographies increased by 67, mainly due to
the Wellcentive acquisition in the Connected Care &
Health Informatics segment. The number of employees
in growth geographies increased by 952 driven by three
factors: Global Business Services right-shoring
supporting functions, further shift and rationalization in
industrial footprint, and new legislation introduced in
China, which capped contingent workforce size at 10%
and prompted insourcing of contingent workers.

2.25 Developing our people

At Philips, we operate with in belief that everyone has
talent and that our people are critical to our
organizational success. With over 105,000 talented and
motivated employees all over the world, it is our people
who continue to turn our strategy into reality. Our
sustained growth and long-term success will be
achieved by becoming a world-class talent-builder,
offering attractive and rewarding work which
contributes to the careers of our people.

Philips University

In 2016, Philips University began implementing a
targeted approach to delivering learning, focusing on
strategic needs, identified through strategic plans of the
business, strategic workforce planning, and talent
reviews. These plans help ensure the effectiveness of
our learning budget. Also, innovative learning
techniques including gamification, video and micro-
learning were infused into learning offerings.

Health and Safety

At Philips we strive to make the world healthier and
more sustainable through innovation. A critical aspect
of which starts with our own people. We believe we are
at our best when our employees are at theirs. A belief
championed by our CEO in his recent Financial Times
article.

Philips strives for an injury-free and illness-free work
environment, with a sharp focus on reducing the
number of injuries and improving processes. As of 2016,
the Total Recordable Cases (TRC) rate is defined as a
Key Performance Indicator (KPI), on which we set
yearly targets for the company, Business Groups and
industrial sites. For data comparability reasons, we also
provide the Lost Workday Injury Cases (LWIC) rate.

We regret to report two fatalities in Philips Lighting in
2016. One of our sales officers passed away after a
traffic accident in Pakistan. In India a contractor died
due to injuries sustained at one of our factories. For
both of these fatalities, a thorough investigation and
root cause analysis were conducted. Corrective actions
were implemented, including reminding our employees
of safe driving rules and accelerating our injury
prevention program to prevent such occurrences in the
future

In 2016, we recorded 174 LWIC, of which 71 in Philips
Lighting. These are occupational injury cases where the
injured person is unable to work one or more days after
the injury. This represents a significant decrease
compared with 213 in 2015, and continues the
downward trend since 2010. The LWIC rate decreased
to 0.18 per 100 FTEs, compared with 0.21 in 2015. The
number of Lost Workdays caused by injuries decreased
by 1,253 days (16%) to 6,728 days in 2016.

In 2016, we recorded 395 TRC, of which 156 in Philips
Lighting. These are cases where the injured employee
is unable to work one or more days, or had medical
treatment or sustained an industrial illness. We will
continue to monitor this KPI and actively set reduction
targets for all our businesses in 2017.

For more information on Health and Safety, please
refer to sub-section 12.3.4, Health and Safety
performance, of this Annual Report.

General Business Principles

The Philips General Business Principles (GBP)
incorporate the fundamental principles for all Philips
business around the world. They set the minimum
standard for business conduct for both individual
employees and for the company and our subsidiaries.
Our GBP also stand as a reference for the business
conduct we expect from our business partners and
suppliers. Translations of the text are available in 32
languages, allowing almost every employee to read the
GBP in their native language. Detailed underlying

Annual Report 2016

policies, manuals, training and tools are in place to give
employees practical guidance on how to apply the GBP
in their day-to-day work environments.

In addition, there are separate Codes of Ethics that
apply to employees working in specific areas of our
business, i.e. the Procurement Code of Ethics and the
Financial Code of Ethics. Details of these can be found
at www.philips.com/gbp.

As part of our unyielding effort to raise GBP awareness
and create engagement throughout the organization on
the different forms acting with integrity can take, each
year a GBP communications and training plan is
deployed. In 2016 a number of new initiatives were
undertaken through various channels such as our
spotlight article series, Quick Reference Cards for at-a-
glance guidance on how to handle a number of
common GBP concerns as well as returning programs
such as e-Learnings which were deployed early in the
year. Many of these initiatives contributed to building
momentum towards our annual Dialogue Week in the
third quarter, which serves as the highlight of our GBP
program for the year. During 2016's Dialogue Week
hundreds of Philips teams held open and frank
discussions on what Acting with Integrity means to
them, and posted pictures of their sessions on the
Philips social platform using the hashtag,
#integritymatters.

The GBP form an integral part of labor contracts in
virtually every country in which Philips operates. It is the
responsibility of each employee to live up to our GBP,
and employees are requested to affirm their
commitment after having completed their GBP e-
training. In addition, employees in respective
specialized areas must sign-off on the Financial and
Supply Management Codes of Ethics. Executives are
requested to sign-off on the General Business
Principles to confirm a renewed commitment to
awareness of and compliance with the respective
codes each year.

The GBP Review Committee is responsible for the
effective deployment of the GBP and for generally
promoting a culture of compliance and ethics within
Philips. The GBP Review Committee is a body chaired
by the Chief Legal Officer, and its members include the
Chief HR Officer, the Chief Market Leader and the Chief
Financial Officer. They are supported in the
implementation of their initiatives by a Committee
Secretariat, and a network of GBP Compliance Officers
who are appointed in all countries and at all major sites
where Philips has operations.

Related roles and responsibilities are laid down in the
Charter of the GBP Review Committee. In 2016, in
response to external regulatory developments in
business ethics and compliance, a revised charter was
deployed by the GBP Review Committee. This newly
updated charter impacted the composition of the GBP
Review Committee, the roles and responsibilities of its


--- Page 17 ---

2.28

2.2.9

members as well as the composition, roles and
responsibilities of the GBP Compliance function. To
strengthen monitoring and oversight of GBP.
compliance within Philips, a mandatory annual GBP
self-assessment questionnaire was introduced. The
GBP Review Committee Secretariat receives an
overview of the results of this self-assessment and can
take action when deemed necessary. We believe this
has created a more robust network equipped with the
requisite skills and support to monitor and enhance
compliance in the increasingly regulated environments
in which Philips operates.

The GBP are supported by established mechanisms
that ensure standardized reporting and escalation of
concerns. These mechanisms are based on the GBP
Reporting Policy that urges employees to report any
concerns they may have regarding business conduct in
relation to the GBP either through a GBP Compliance
Officer or through the Philips Ethics Line. The Philips
Ethics Line enables employees and also third parties to
report a concern either by telephone or online viaa web
intake form in a variety of different languages 24/7 all
year round. All concerns raised are registered
consistently in a single database hosted externally from
Philips by a third party and are investigated uniformly
in accordance with standardized investigation
procedures.

More information on the Philips GBP can be found in
chapter 5, Risk management, of this Annual Report. The
results of the monitoring measures in place are given in
sub-section 12.3.5, General Business Principles, of this
Annual Report.

Working with stakeholders

In organizing ourselves around customers and markets,
we create dialogues with our stakeholders in order to
explore common ground for addressing societal
challenges, building partnerships and jointly
developing supporting ecosystems for our innovations
around the world. To deliver on our vision to make the
world healthier and more sustainable through
innovation, working with partners is crucial. An
overview of stakeholders and topics discussed is
provided in chapter 12, Sustainability statements, of this
Annual Report.

For more information on our stakeholder engagement
activities in 2016, please refer to sub-section 12.3.7,
Stakeholder Engagement, of this Annual Report.

Supplier sustainability

Royal Philips has a direct business relationship with
approximately 8,500 product and component
suppliers and 22,000 service providers. In many cases
the sustainability issues deeper in our supply chain
require us to intervene beyond tier 1 of the chain.

23

Group performance 2.27

Supplier sustainability strategy

Managing our large and complex supply chain ina
socially and environmentally responsible way requires
a structured and innovative approach while being
transparent and engaging with a wide variety of
stakeholders. Insights gained through the stakeholder
engagement process are used as an input to develop
our supplier sustainability strategy. We then translate
this strategy into five dedicated programs:

1. Supplier sustainability compliance

Combination of contractual sustainability commitment
of Philips suppliers defined in two core Supplier
Sustainability policy documents (Supplier
Sustainability Declaration (SSD) and Regulated
Substances List (RSL)) and additional transparency
requirements to provide information and evidence on
topics mentioned in SSD and RSL.

2. Supplier sustainability performance

This program aims to bring about structural, sustainable
improvement in our supply chain while focusing on
health and safety, remuneration and benefits, and
workforce turnover. This approach has been designed
to replace the Philips audit program and was piloted in
2016 on a sample of 93 supplier sites in China.

3. Responsible sourcing

This program aims to manage sustainability risks
related to minerals mined in conflict-affected and high-
risk regions. Philips addresses the complexities of the
minerals supply chains through continuous due
diligence process combined with multi-stakeholder
initiatives to responsible sourcing.

4. Circular procurement

Philips’ ambition is to increase its circular business
proposition and it has set a 2020 target to achieve 15%
circular revenues. This program identifies how
procurement can contribute to our ambition to be a
provider of circular solutions and services.

5. Environmental footprint China

This program serves to reduce the environmental
footprint of our suppliers’ sites in China. Furthermore,
we want to focus on increasing supply chain
transparency in terms of environmental footprint and
to drive responsible use of resources through our
supply chain. An example is the collaboration of Philips
witha Chinese NGO, the Institute of Public Environment
(IPE)

Please refer to sub-section 12.3.8, Supplier indicators,
of this Annual Report for more details and to the Philips
Lighting Investor Relations website for details on the
Lighting Supplier Sustainability program.

Environmental performance

Philips has a long sustainability history stretching all the
way back to our founding fathers. In 1994, we launched
our first program and set sustainability targets for our
own operations. Next, we launched our second

Annual Report 2016 23


--- Page 18 ---

231

24

Group performance 23

program in 1998, which focused on the environmental
dimension of our operations and products. We also
started to focus on sustainability in our supply chain in
2003. We extended our scope further in 2010 by
including the social dimension of products and
solutions, which is now reflected in our company vision:

We strive to make the world healthier and more
sustainable through innovation. Our goal is to improve
the lives of 3 billion people a year by 2025.

In 2016, our CEO Frans van Houten launched our new
Royal Philips five-year sustainability program, ‘Healthy
people, sustainable planet’, addressing both social and
environmental challenges and including associated
targets to be achieved by 2020.

The three pillars of the ‘Healthy people, sustainable
planet’ program are:

Creating value for our customers through
Sustainable Solutions

Leading by example in our Sustainable Operations
Multiplying our impact by driving Sustainability
through our supply chain

More details on the new program, as well as the initial
results, have been addressed in this report.

Every year, Royal Philips publishes a full Integrated
Annual Report. Our independent auditor Ernst & Young
(EY) has not only audited our financial information but
has also provided reasonable (highest level) assurance
on Sustainability Information in chapter 12,
Sustainability statements, of this Annual Report and
sections section 2.2, Social performance, of this Annual
Report and section 2.3, Environmental performance, of
this Annual Report. Please refer to section 12.5,
Assurance report of the independent auditor, of this
Annual Report. With this, Philips is a frontrunner in this
field.

Please refer to the Philips Lighting Investor Relations
website for more details on the new Lighting
sustainability program and results.

In this Environmental performance section an overview
is given of the most important environmental
parameters of the new program. Improving people’s
lives, Health and Safety, and Supplier Sustainability are
addressed in the Social performance section. Details of
the ‘Healthy people, sustainable planet’ parameters
can be found in the chapter 12, Sustainability
statements, of this Annual Report.

Diagnosis & Treatment businesses

Philips develops innovative Diagnosis & Treatment
solutions that enable first-time right diagnosis,
precision interventions and therapy, while respecting
the boundaries of natural resources. Investments in
Green Innovation in 2016 amounted to EUR 133 million,
a 29% increase compared to 2015. All Philips Green
Focal Areas are taken into account while we aim to
reduce environmental impact over the total lifecycle.
Energy efficiency is an area of focus, especially for our
large imaging systems such as MRI. Closing the
materials loop is another area where our focus on
developing upgrading pathways has enabled extended
product life and therefore reduced materials use and
lower cost. Our Diagnosis & Treatment businesses
actively support a voluntary industry initiative to
improve the energy efficiency of medical imaging
equipment. Moreover, we are actively partnering with
multiple leading care providers to look together for
innovative ways to reduce the environmental impact of
healthcare, for example by maximizing energy-efficient
use of medical equipment and optimizing lifecycle
value

Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses
Philips innovates with connected health IT solutions

resources. It is our belief that well-designed e-health
solutions can reduce the travel-related carbon
footprint of healthcare, and improve access and
outcomes. Investments in Green Innovation in 2016
amounted to EUR 38 million, a doubling compared to
2015. All Philips Green Focal Areas are taken into
account as we aim to reduce environmental impact
over the total lifecycle. Energy efficiency and material
reduction are the main areas of focus.

Personal Health businesses

Continuous high R&D investments at our Personal
Health businesses are also reflected in Green
Innovation spend, which amounted to EUR 96 million
in 2016, compared with EUR 99 million in 2015. The
investments resulted in high Green Revenues in all
Business Groups. The Personal Health businesses
continued their work on improving the energy efficiency
of their products, closing the materials loop (e.g. by
using recycled materials in products and packaging)
and the voluntary phase-out of polyvinyl chloride
(PVC), brominated flame retardants (BFR), Bisphenol A
(BPA) and phthalates from, among others, food contact
products. In particular, close to 100% of the Mother &
Child Care, Male Grooming and Oral Healthcare
products are completely PVC/BFR free.

Lighting

Philips Lighting strives to make the world healthier and
more sustainable through energy-efficient light. With a
2016 investment of EUR 281 million in Green Innovation,
Lighting invested 11% more compared to 2015.
Increasing investments in digital solutions and
connectivity have led to further improvements in the
area of energy efficiency. In 2016, Philip Lighting
teamed up with the Dubai Municipality to create the
Dubai Lamp Initiative, a unique research partnership
that resulted in the development of the world’s most
energy-efficient commercially available LED lamp. By
replacing conventional lamps with the Dubai Lamp —
the first commercially available 200 lumen per watt
LED lamp — households and enterprises can reduce
electricity used for lighting by more than 90%
compared to incandescent technologies. In addition to
raising light and energy efficiency to new levels, the
Dubai Lamp is extremely durable with an average
lifespan of up to 15 times that of conventional lamps.

HealthTech Other

HealthTech Other invested EUR 10 million in Green
Innovations, spread over projects focused on global
challenges related to water, air, energy, food, Circular
Economy, and access to affordable healthcare. The
Research organization within HealthTech Other used
the Sustainable Innovation Assessment tool, in which
innovation projects are evaluated and scored along the
environmental and social dimensions, in order to
identify those projects that most strongly drive
sustainability. Transfers of Research projects include a
Lives Improved calculation to assess what the project's
contribution will be to Philips’ vision to improve the lives
of 3 billion people a year by 2025. Intellectual Property

& Standards has developed a Sustainable IP portfolio
for which the spend has been included in the above
total for HealthTech Other.

At the end of 2016, Philips’ IP portfolio consisted of 5.7%
green patent families. All families are labeled with at
least one Green Focal Area. In 2016, 3.3% of our total
new patent filings were flagged as relating to green
patent family. As IP is an extension of Philips’
innovation efforts, the portfolio percentage related to
green patents is multiplied by our annual patent
portfolio costs to determine Philips’ yearly investment
in Green IP.

While a product can be classified as green because it
incorporates an environmentally friendly technology,
such technology cannot always be protected ina
patent because of a lack of patentability over the state-
of-the-art technology. Therefore, there is not
necessarily a correlation between green patents and
Green Technologies in Green Products and Solutions.

Circular Economy

The transition from a linear to a circular economy is
essential to create a sustainable world. A circular
economy aims to decouple economic growth from the
use of natural resources and ecosystems by using these
resources more effectively. It is a driver of innovation in
the areas of material, component and product re-use,
as well as new business models such as system
solutions and services. In a circular economy, more
effective (re)use of materials enables the creation of
more value, both by means of cost savings and by
developing new markets or growing existing ones. The
‘Healthy people, sustainable planet’ program includes
a target to generate 15% of our revenues in 2020 from
Circular Products and Solutions.

For more information on our Circular Economy
activities and the progress towards targets in 2016,
please refer to sub-section 12.4.1, Circular Economy, of
this Annual Report. Please refer to the Philips Lighting
Investor Relations website for more details on circular
products and solutions of Philips Lighting.

Green Revenues

Green Revenues are generated through products and
solutions which offer a significant environmental
improvement in one or more Green Focal Areas: Energy
efficiency, Packaging, Hazardous substances, Weight,
Circularity, and Lifetime reliability. Green Revenues,
excluding the Lumileds and Automotive business,
increased to EUR 15.7 billion in 2016, or 64.1% of sales
(61.0% in 2015), thereby reaching a record level for
Philips.

The exclusion of Lumileds and Automotive had a 1%

negative impact on the total Green Revenues
percentage.

Through our EcoDesign process we aim to create
products and solutions that have significantly less
impact on the environment during their whole lifecycle.
Overall, the most significant improvements have been
realized in our energy efficiency Green Focal Area, an
important objective of our program, although there was
also growing attention for hazardous substances and
recyclability in all segments in 2016, the latter driven by
our Circular Economy initiatives.

New Green Products and Solutions from each segment
include the following examples.

Diagnosis & Treatment businesses

In 2016, our Diagnosis & Treatment businesses
maintained the Green Product and Solutions portfolio
with redesigns of various Green Products with further
environmental improvements. These products improve
patient outcomes, provide better value, and help
secure access to high-quality care, while reducing
environmental impact. We continued to add an energy-
efficient CryoCompressor to our MRI systems, with
energy savings in the various non-scanning modes of
30-40%.

233

Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses

Our Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses
grew the Green Product and Solutions portfolio with
three new products and solutions which offer better
technology and functionality and at the same time
reduce environmental impact. Examples include a new
patient monitor GS10/GS20/G30E/G4OE series from
our Goldway China site with a 21% reduction in product
weight and an 18% reduction in energy usage,
compared to the predecessor products. Another
example is the patient mask AF541, which has a 33%
lower product weight and no longer contains
polycarbonate compared to its predecessor mask and
thus has no risk of containing bisphenol-A.

Personal Health businesses

Our Personal Health businesses focuses on Green
Products and Solutions which meet or exceed our
minimum requirements in the areas of energy
consumption, packaging, and substances of concern

Annual Report 2016

Green Revenues in 2016 surpassed 56% of total sales.
All our Green Products with rechargeable batteries (like
toothbrushes, shavers, and grooming products) exceed
the stringent California energy efficiency norm by at
least 10%. We are making steady progress in developing
PVC/BFR-free products. More than 55% of sales consist
of PVC/BFR-free products, with the exception of the
power cords, for which there are not yet economically
viable alternatives available. In the remaining 30% of
product sales, PVC/BFR has already been phased out
to a significant extent, but the products are not yet
completely free of these substances.

Sleep & Respiratory Care (S&RC) launched the Simple
Mini Go portable oxygen concentrator (POC), the
smallest and lightest POC ever developed by Philips;
compared to its predecessor the product weight has
been reduced by 40% and energy efficiency improved
by 20%.

Lighting

Green Revenues within Lighting increased to 78% in
2016. Connected Lighting systems and LED contributed
to Green Revenues with solutions in more applications
and market segments. In Jakarta, Indonesia, 90,000
street luminaires were retrofitted this year with energy
efficient LED lights connected by the Philips CityTouch
lighting management system. Each light point is now
connected, using sensors that collect performance
data. As a result, city officials can now monitor Jakarta’s
lighting infrastructure, remotely managing light levels to
match different needs by district. At the same time,
Jakarta can better manage its carbon footprint, reduce
energy expenses and improve public services.

Sustainable Operations

The Sustainable Operations programs, in Royal Philips
and Philips Lighting focus on the main contributors to

climate change, recycling of waste, reduction of water
consumption, and reduction of emissions. Full details

can be found in chapter 12, Sustainability statements,

of this Annual Report.

Carbon footprint and energy efficiency

Both Royal Philips and Philips Lighting are committed
to the ambition of becoming carbon-neutral in our
operations during the COP21 United Nations Climate
Summit in Paris (December 2015). The target we have
set is to be 100% carbon-neutral in our operations by
2020 and sourcing all our electricity usage from 100%
renewable sources.

After achieving our 40% reduction target in 2015
compared to our 2007 base year we continued to
decrease our carbon emissions in 2016. We achieved a
5% carbon reduction compared to 2015, resulting ina
total of 1,344 kilotonnes CO, emission. This reduction is
mainly driven by increasing our renewable electricity
share globally from 56% in 2015 to 62% in 2016. This led
to. a 17% carbon reduction in our industrial sites. As of
December 2016 we source 100% of our US electricity
demand from the Los Mirasoles windfarm in Texas


--- Page 21 ---

through a 15-year Power Purchase Agreement.
Additionally, Philips created a renewable electricity
purchasing consortium with AkzoNobel, DSM and
Google, and the four companies closed the first wind
energy transaction in the Netherlands in October 2016
- the Krammer windfarm in the Zeeland province.

Our business travel emissions showed a reduction of
4% compared to 2015, driven by a stricter air travel
policy introduced in the last quarter of 2016. This led to
an air travel reduction of 5%. The emissions resulting
from our lease cars decreased by 4%, slightly offset by an
increase in carbon emissions from our rental cars usage
(+6%). In order to further decrease our business travel
emissions we will continue to promote video
conferencing as an alternative to travel in 2017.

Within our logistics operations we have seen no
significant changes in the overall carbon emissions
compared to the previous year. Our air freight emissions
went up 6% over the course of 2016 to meet demand in
our HealthTech businesses, partially caused by distress
at one of our larger ocean freight carriers. This was offset
by significant reductions within Lighting due to a stricter
air freight policy and a Royal Philips program to increase
the loading degree of our containers for ocean freight.

Our operational energy efficiency improved by 8%, from
1.11 terajoules per million euro sales in 2015 to 1.01
terajoules per million euro sales in 2016 as a result of
energy efficiency programs in our industrial sites. During
2016, the applied emission factors used to calculate our
operational carbon footprint have been updated with
the latest DEFRA (UK Department for Environment,
Food & Rural Affairs) 2016 emission factors. Philips
reports all its emissions in line with the Greenhouse Gas
Protocol (GHGP) as further described in chapter 12,
Sustainability statements, of this Annual Report.

The impact of the exclusion of Lumileds and
Automotive is displayed as discontinued operations in
the next graph; the size of which varies over the years,
but averages around 18% over the past five years where
emissions from our non-industrial facilities and
business travel have been estimated based on FTE
data. In 2016, Lumileds and Automotive business travel
was based on actuals and non-industrial sites were
extrapolated based on floor area. For our logistics
emissions, the part of discontinued operations has been
estimated using Philips Lighting revenue share as a proxy.

Water

Total water intake in 2016 was 2.4 million m?, about 11%
lower than in 2015. This decrease was mainly due to
operational changes, lower production volumes at
multiple Lighting sites where water is used for cooling
purposes, and water-saving actions at various sites.

Lighting represents around 60% of total water usage. At
Lighting, water is used in manufacturing as well as for
domestic purposes. In Royal Philips, water is mainly
used for domestic purposes. The exclusion of Lumileds
and Automotive has a significant downward impact on
the water consumption of Philips. In 2016, Lumileds and
Automotive accounted for 1.7 million m? of water.

Waste

In 2016, total waste decreased by some 5% compared
to 2015 to 64.8 kilotonnes, mainly due to operational
changes, lower production volumes and less packaging
waste at Lighting sites. Lighting contributed 62% of total
waste, Personal Health businesses 22%, Diagnosis &
Treatment businesses 14% and Connected Care &
Health Informatics businesses 2%. The reported
increase in waste in Diagnosis & Treatment businesses
was partially caused by the removal of obsolete
components and two newly acquired reporting sites.
The exclusion of Lumileds and Automotive had a
downward impact on total waste of 6.2 kilotonnes.

Total waste consists of waste that is delivered for
landfill, incineration or recycling. Materials delivered for
recycling via an external contractor comprised 54
kilotonnes, which equals 83% of total waste,
comparable to 2015. Of the 17% remaining waste, 81%
comprised non-hazardous waste and 19% hazardous
waste. A total of 6.1 kilotonnes of waste was sent to
landfill. Our sites are addressing both the recycling
percentage as well as waste sent to landfill as part of
both the new Royal Philips and Philips Lighting
sustainability programs.

Annual Report 2016

In the ‘Healthy people, sustainable planet’ program,
Royal Philips included new reduction targets for the
substances that are most relevant for its businesses. In
order to provide comparable information at Group
level, please find the summary of the emissions of the
formerly targeted substances below. Emissions of
restricted substances reduced from 26 kilos in 2015 to
7 kilos in 2016, mainly caused by one site in China which
phased out a thinner containing benzene. For the fourth
year in arow, mercury emissions at Lighting were as low
as reasonably achievable, according to our assessment.
The level of emissions of hazardous substances
decreased from 25,101 kilos to 12,412 kilos in 2016
(-51%), mainly driven by changes in the lacquering
process and product mix in the Personal Health
businesses.

2.4 Proposed distribution to

shareholders

Pursuant to article 34 of the articles of association of
Royal Philips, a dividend will first be declared on
preference shares out of net income. The remainder of
the net income, after reservations made with the
approval of the Supervisory Board, shall be available
for distribution to holders of common shares subject to
shareholder approval after year-end. As of December
31, 2016, the issued share capital consists only of
common shares; no preference shares have been
issued. Article 33 of the articles of association of Royal
Philips gives the Board of Management the power to
determine what portion of the net income shall be
retained by way of reserve, subject to the approval of
the Supervisory Board.

A proposal will be submitted to the upcoming Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders to declare a dividend
of EUR 0.80 per common share (up to EUR 745 million),
in cash or in shares at the option of the shareholder,
against the net income for 2016.

If the above dividend proposal is adopted, the shares
will be traded ex-dividend as of May 12, 2017 and May
15, 2017 at the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext
Amsterdam, respectively. In compliance with the listing
requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and the
stock market of Euronext Amsterdam, the dividend
record date will be May 16, 2017.

Shareholders will be given the opportunity to make
their choice between cash and shares between May 17,
2017 and June 9, 2017. If no choice is made during this
election period the dividend will be paid in cash. On
June 9, 2017 after close of trading, the number of share
dividend rights entitled to one new common share will
be determined based on the volume weighted average
price of all traded common shares Koninklijke Philips
N.V. at Euronext Amsterdam on June 7, 8 and 9, 2017.
The Company will calculate the number of share
dividend rights entitled to one new common share (the
‘ratio’), such that the gross dividend in shares will be
approximately equal to the gross dividend in cash. The
ratio and the number of shares to be issued will be
announced on June 13, 2017. Payment of the dividend
and delivery of new common shares, with settlement of
fractions in cash, if required, will take place from June
14, 2017. The distribution of dividend in cash to holders
of New York Registry shares will be made in USD at the
USD/EUR rate as per WM/ Reuters FX Benchmark 2 PM
CET fixing of June 12, 2017.

Further details will be given in the agenda for the 2017
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. All dates
mentioned remain provisional until then.

Dividend in cash is in principle subject to 15% Dutch

dividend withholding tax, which will be deducted from
the dividend in cash paid to the shareholders. Dividend
in shares paid out of net income and retained earnings

Group performance 2.4

is subject to 15% dividend withholding tax, but only in
respect of the par value of the shares (EUR 0.20 per
share).

In 2016, a dividend of EUR 0.80 per common share was
paid in cash or shares, at the option of the shareholder.
For 55.0% of the shares, the shareholders elected for a
share dividend resulting in the issue of 17,344,462 new
common shares, leading to a 1.9% dilution. EUR 330
million was paid in cash. See also chapter 14, Investor
Relations, of this Annual Report.

The balance sheet presented in this report, as part of
the Company financial statements for the period ended
December 31, 2016, is before appropriation of the result
for the financial year 2016.

The health technology landscape

Health systems around the world are under increasing economic pressure. More people are living longer, and more are
living with chronic conditions — driving healthcare spending to unsustainable levels. Shortages of healthcare
professionals are also adding to the relentless challenge of delivering better care at lower cost to growing patient
populations.

Fundamental transformative changes are already taking place in the healthcare industry to enable the provision of
affordable, quality care to those who need it. A shift is under way towards value-based healthcare, which places greater
emphasis on results, driving the reduction of waste and inefficiency, increasing access and improving outcomes, while
at the same time reducing costs.

Consumers are becoming increasingly engaged in managing their own health, with greater attention being focused on
the benefits of healthy living and home care. Mobile and digital technologies are significant enablers of this trend, leading
to new care delivery models — founded upon integrated care, real-time analytics and personalized solutions and
services — that give patients greater control over, and responsibility for, their health:

Philips (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA) is a health technology company focused on improving people's lives through meaningful
innovation across the health continuum — from healthy living and prevention to diagnosis, treatment and home care.
Applying advanced technologies and deep clinical and consumer insights, Philips partners with customers to deliver
integrated solutions that enable better outcomes at lower cost.

Our structure in 2016

Koninklijke Philips N.V. (‘Royal Philips’ or the ‘Company’) is the parent company of the Philips Group (‘Philips’ or the
Group’), headquartered in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The Company is managed by the members of the Executive
Committee (comprising the Board of Management and certain key officers) under the supervision of the Supervisory
Board. The Executive Committee operates under the chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer and shares
responsibility for the deployment of Philips’ strategy and policies, and the achievement of its objectives and results.

In September 2014, Philips announced its plan to sharpen its strategic focus by establishing two stand-alone companies
focused on the HealthTech and Lighting opportunities respectively. To this end, a stand-alone structure was established
for Philips Lighting within the Philips Group, effective February 1, 2016. Then, on May 27, 2016, Philips Lighting was listed
and started trading on Euronext in Amsterdam under the symbol ‘LIGHT’. Following the listing of Philips Lighting, Philips
retained a 71.225% stake and continued to consolidate Philips Lighting, through 2016. On February 8, 2017, Philips
announced that it had successfully completed an accelerated bookbuild offering to institutional investors and to Philips
Lighting of 26.0 million shares in Philips Lighting, reducing Philips’ stake in Philips Lighting’s issued and outstanding
share capital from 71.225% to approximately 55.180%. The transaction is in line with Philips’ stated objective to fully sell
down its stake in Philips Lighting over the next several years.

In light of its focus on health technology, effective January 1, 2016, Philips eliminated the former Healthcare and
Consumer Lifestyle sector layers in order to drive the convergence of consumer health and professional healthcare, as
well as to reduce overhead costs, and changed the reporting of its health technology activities. At the same time, the
former Innovation, Group & Services was split and allocated to Philips and Philips Lighting respectively.

Annual Report 2016

Through our Personal Health businesses, we offer a
broad range of products from high to low price/value
quartiles, necessitating a diverse distribution model.
We continue to expand our portfolio and increase its
accessibility, particularly in lower-tier cities in growth
geographies. We are well positioned to capture further
growth in online sales and continue to build our digital
and e-commerce capabilities. We are adapting our web
functionality to offer consumers a better user
experience via smaller screens, driving improvements
from conversion to sales. And we continue to roll-out
high-impact consumer marketing programs in support
of key innovations. The launch of Philips OneBlade, for
example, was accompanied by the deployment of an
innovative Digital Advocacy Marketing Program.

The company’s wide portfolio of connected consumer
health products leverages Philips HealthSuite — a
cloud-enabled connected health ecosystem of
devices, apps and digital tools that enables
personalized health and continuous care

We are leveraging connectivity to engage consumers in
new and impactful ways through social media and
digital innovation. For example, in 2016 we launched
the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Platinum Connected
toothbrush. With unique smart sensor technology
inside the toothbrush — connecting to the Philips
Sonicare smartphone app via Bluetooth — users receive
personalized step-by-step coaching, real-time
feedback and post-brush analysis with a visual 3D
mouth map to help improve brushing technique. Via the
Philips HealthSuite digital platform, the app allows data
to be shared with dental practices, so hygienists can
mark up areas that need special attention.

Under normal economic conditions, Philips’ Personal
Health businesses experience seasonality, with higher
sales in the fourth quarter.

In 2016, Personal Health employed approximately
22,530 people worldwide. The global sales and service
organization covered more than 50 mature and growth
geographies. In addition, we operated manufacturing
and business creation organizations in Argentina,
Austria, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Italy, the
Netherlands, Romania, the UK and the US.

Commitment to quality

The implementation of the Philips Business System is
embedding a fundamental commitment to quality
across all our processes, products, systems and
services. Philips’ Personal Health businesses are
subject to regulatory requirements in the markets
where they operate. This includes the European
Union’s Waste from Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (WEEE), Restriction of Hazardous
Substances (ROHS), Registration, Evaluation,
Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH),
Energy-using Products (EuP) requirements and

Healthy people, sustainable planet
Sustainability continued to play an important role in the
Personal Health businesses in 2016, with the main focus
on optimizing the sustainability performance of our
products and operations. Green Revenues, sales of
products and solutions which meet or exceed our
minimum requirements in the area of energy
consumption, packaging and/or substances of
concern, accounted for 56% of total sales in 2016. All
Green Products with rechargeable batteries exceed the
stringent California energy efficiency standard by at
least 10%. And over 54% of total sales are PVC- and/or
BFR-free products (excluding power cords).

As part of our Circular Economy program we have
continued to increase the use of recycled materials in
our products. Over 1,440 tons of recycled plastics were
used in kitchen appliances, vacuum cleaners, irons, air
purification and coffee machines, compared to 900
tons in 2015. The revenue from Circular Products
reached over EUR 414 million in 2016, comprised of
turnover generated from performance- and access-
based business models in Sleep & Respiratory Care and
products with recycled plastic materials.

As aconcrete example of our commitment to
sustainability we launched the new Performer Ultimate
vacuum cleaner, for which we have created a closed-
loop recycling system. Old Philips vacuum cleaners are
collected in Western Europe and recycled separately
from other products and brands. The plastics from the
old vacuum cleaners are then mixed with other recycled
plastics to create a new recycled plastic that is used to
produce the new Performer Ultimate, which is free of
PVC/BFR, has an A-class energy label and contains
36% recycled plastics.

In our operations we continue to draw most of our
electricity from renewable sources, with the ultimate
aim of having CO,-neutral production sites by 2020. In
2016, 47% of the electricity used in manufacturing sites
came from renewable sources and 85% of the industrial

Annual Report 2016

waste was recycled. We sent 7% of our manufacturing
waste to landfill in 2016 and started a detailed analysis
of waste streams that are landfilled by our production
sites. Based on this we will define actions to reach our
goal of zero waste to landfill in 2020.

About Diagnosis & Treatment businesses

Our Diagnosis & Treatment businesses are foundational
to our health technology strategy, delivering on the
promise of precision medicine and least-invasive
treatment and therapy. We enable our customers to
realize the full potential of their ‘triple aim’ — to improve
outcomes, lower the cost of care delivery and enhance
the patient experience — by enabling first-time-right
diagnosis and treatment. We are focused on providing
the most efficient path to obtaining a definitive
diagnosis by integrating multiple sources of information
and combining the data to create a comprehensive
patient view. By bringing together imaging morphology,
pathology and genomics, we are able to interrogate
and extract the information needed to offer very
personalized care. Our informatics platform provides
the intelligence to make more consistent decisions, as
well as making it easier to share and collaborate.

With our image-guided therapy, clinicians are provided
with the technology necessary to determine the
presence of disease, guide treatment procedures and
confirm effectiveness. Our solutions enable patient-
specific treatment planning and selection, simplify
complex procedures through integrated real-time
guidance, and provide clinically proven treatment
solutions. We provide image guidance both in our
proprietary products and by partnering with radiation
therapy companies like Elekta and IBA to deliver real-
time, precise cancer treatment.

In addition to our solutions for clinical pathways, we
provide a range of technologies to help our customers
improve their operational results. This year we
introduced a comprehensive suite of software services
designed to improve radiology department operations
— PerformanceBridge is a multi-vendor offering that
provides practice management, dose management and
service analytics. It can be delivered as a service
offering to promote continuous improvement, or as a
professional service where our people partner with our
customers to improve operating effectiveness.

The value proposition to our customers is based on
leveraging our extensive clinical experience with our
broad portfolio of technologies — making us uniquely
capable to provide meaningful solutions that ultimately
can improve the lives of the patients we serve while
lowering the cost of care delivery for our customers.

Image-Guided Therapy

Sales at Philips’ Diagnosis & Treatment businesses are
generally higher in the second half of the year, largely
due to the timing of new product availability and
customer spending patterns.

Sales channels are a mix of a direct sales force,
especially in all the larger markets, combined with
online sales portal and distributors — this varies by
product, market and price segment. Sales are mostly
driven by a direct sales force that has an intimate
knowledge of the procedures for which our devices are
used, and visits our customer base frequently.

Commitment to quality

The implementation of the Philips Business System is
embedding a fundamental commitment to quality
across all our processes, products, systems and
services. This commitment is of vital importance in the
extensively regulated health equipment and system
business. We are committed to compliance with
regulatory product approval and quality system
requirements in every market we serve, by addressing
specific requirements of local and national regulatory
authorities including the US FDA, the CFDA in China and
comparable agencies in other countries, as well as the
European Union's Waste from Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (WEEE), Restriction of Hazardous
Substances (ROHS) and Registration, Evaluation,
Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)
regulations.

The imaging businesses and image processing
applications are governed by regulatory approvals in
the markets that we serve. In almost all cases, new
products that we introduce are subject to a regulatory
approval process (e.g. 510k for FDA approvals in the
USA). Failing to comply with the regulatory
requirements can have severe consequences. The
number and diversity of regulatory bodies in the various
markets we operate in globally adds complexity and
time to product introductions. Regulatory approval is a
prerequisite for market introduction of medical devices.

Further progress was made in 2016 in strengthening the
remediated quality management system at our facility
in Cleveland, Ohio, with the ramp-up of production and
shipments continuing in 2017.

About Connected Care & Health Informatics
businesses

Spanning the entire health continuum, the Connected
Care & Health Informatics businesses aim to empower
consumers, care givers and clinicians with digital
solutions that facilitate value-based care by enabling
precision medicine and population health
management, building on Philips’ strengths in
consumer technology, patient monitoring and clinical

Philips’ products and related services are subject to
various regulations and standards. The Company is
committed to quality and over the last years made
investments to enable significant progress in this area.
The Company is currently in advanced discussions on
resolving a civil matter with the US Department of
Justice representing the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), arising from past inspections by
the FDA in and prior to 2015. The discussions focus
primarily on the Company's compliance with the FDA's
Quality System Regulations in the Company’s
Emergency Care and Resuscitation (ECR) business in
the United States. While discussions have not yet
concluded, the Company anticipates that the actions
necessary to address the FDA’s compliance concerns
will have a meaningful impact on the operations of its

EBITA? in 2016 included restructuring and acquisition-
related charges of EUR 14 million compared to EUR 38
million in 2015. 2016 EBITA” also included a net release
of provisions of EUR 12 million, while in 2015 included
charges of EUR 28 million related to the currency
revaluation of the Masimo provision and charges of
EUR 1 million related to the devaluation of the Argentine
peso. The margin increase was mainly driven by higher
volumes and lower restructuring and acquisition-
related charges and other items, partly offset by higher
expenditure on innovation.

Healthy people, sustainable planet

A growing and aging population, the rise of chronic and
lifestyle-related diseases and global resource
constraints pose a number of challenges, including
pollution and stressed healthcare systems. Philips is
committed to addressing these challenges with
connected health IT solutions that integrate, collect,
combine and deliver quality data for actionable insights
to help improve access to quality care, while respecting
the boundaries of natural resources.

It is our belief that well-designed solutions can reduce
the travel-related carbon footprint of healthcare, and
improve access and outcomes.

In 2016, Green Revenues increased to EUR 1,442 million
and we continued to expand the portfolio of Philips
Green Products that support energy efficiency,
materials reduction and other sustainability goals.

Supporting the transition to a circular economy, we
continue to expand innovative ‘access over ownership’
service solutions where our customers pay for things
where and when required, while Philips can secure high
levels of recycling and materials re-use.

Lighting

Philips Lighting is led by Eric Rondolat, who has held
the position of Chief Executive Officer since the
company was listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock
exchange (ticker symbol: LIGHT) on May 27, 2016. Prior
to that, he was Chief Executive Officer of Lighting at
Royal Philips from April 2012 to May 27, 2016.

Following the listing of Philips Lighting, Philips retained
a 71.225% stake and continued to consolidate Philips
Lighting through 2016, with the aim of fully selling down
over the next several years. On February 8, 2017, Philips
announced that it had successfully completed an
accelerated bookbuild offering to institutional investors
and to Philips Lighting of 26.0 million shares in Philips
Lighting, reducing Philips’ stake in Philips Lighting’s
issued and outstanding share capital from 71.225% to
approximately 55.180%. The transaction is in line with
Philips’ stated objective to fully sell down its stake in
Philips Lighting over the next several years.

Lighting landscape

A number of trends and transitions are affecting the
lighting industry and changing the way people use and
experience light.

Philips Lighting serves a large and attractive market that
is driven by the need for more light, the need for
energy-efficient lighting, and the need for digital and
connected lighting.

The world’s population is forecast to grow from 7 billion
today to over 10 billion by 2050. At the same time, we
are witnessing rapid urbanization, with about two-
thirds of the world’s population expected to live in
urban areas by 2050. These trends will increase
demand for light. In addition, in the face of resource
constraints and climate change, the world needs that
light to be energy-efficient. At the same time, the
lighting industry is moving from conventional to LED
lighting, which is changing the way people use,
experience and interact with light. Digital technologies
enable connectivity and seamless integration in
software architectures, systems and services.
Connected lighting allows light points to be used as
information pathways, opening up new functionalities
and services based on the transmission and analysis of
data.

About Lighting

Philips Lighting is a global market leader with
recognized expertise in the development, manufacture
and application of innovative, energy-efficient lighting
products, systems and services that improve people’s
lives. It has pioneered many of the key breakthroughs
in lighting over the past 125 years, laying the basis for
its current strength and leading position in the digital
transformation to connected lighting.

The company aims to further invest to support its
leadership in LED and connected lighting systems and
services while at the same time capitalizing on its broad
portfolio, distribution and brand in conventional
lighting by successful implementation of its ‘last man
standing’ strategy.

Philips Lighting addresses people's lighting needs
across a full range of market segments. Indoors, it offers
lighting products, systems and services for homes,
shops, offices, schools, hotels, factories and hospitals.
Outdoors, it offers products, systems and services for
roads, streets, public spaces, residential areas and

Philips Lighting is one of the few companies in the world
to offer solutions across the lighting value chain —
including software, controls, luminaires, light sources,
and modules. It will build on its global reach with current
commercial activities that cover approximately 180
countries. Philips Lighting has operational
manufacturing plants in 22 countries in all major regions
of the world, and more than 70 sales offices worldwide.

Commitment to quality

The implementation of the Philips Business System is
embedding a fundamental commitment to quality
across all Philips Lighting’s processes, products,
systems and services. Lighting is subject to significant
regulatory requirements in the markets where it
operates. These include the European Union’s Waste
from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE),
Restriction of Hazardous Substances (ROHS),
Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction
of Chemicals (REACH), Energy-related Products (ErP)
and Energy Performance of Buildings (EPBD)
directives.

2016 business highlights

Philips Lighting is actively building partnerships for its
connected lighting systems for both professional and
consumer markets. The company announced a
partnership with US company Aisle411 for digital
mapping of retail stores. It also teamed up with Amazon
Alexa, Google Home and with Huawei’s OceanConnect
for the interoperability of the Philips Hue connected
lighting system, making this the first connected lighting
system that can be used with all leading smart home
platforms.

Philips Lighting’s partnership with Cisco resulted in
Power-over-Ethernet connected lighting systems for
the headquarters of Smartworld in Dubai, Intel’s new
research campus in Bangalore and Infinorsa’s Torre
Europa building in Madrid.

In the retail segment Philips Lighting implemented its
first connected lighting indoor positioning system in the
Middle East with United Arab Emirates-based retailer
aswaagq, one of the world’s most innovative
supermarkets and community malls. The new system
uses lights that act as a positioning system and allows
customers to use smartphones to access location-
based services.

Philips Lighting also extended the number of
connected street lighting contracts, supplying nearly
90,000 connected street luminaires in Jakarta as one
of its biggest projects to date. The system will be
managed by the Philips CityTouch street lighting
management system, which has been installed in more
than 700 projects across 35 countries since its inception
in 2012.

The range of LED lighting was extended with Philips

SceneSwitch, which combines multiple light settings in
one lamp, enabling users to select the right light for their

Annual Report 2016

3.5.4

needs using an existing wall switch. It also introduced a
range of spots and decorative bulbs that use
WarmGlow for dimming, meaning the more you dim,
the warmer the light effect. With Dubai Municipality the
company developed the Dubai lamp, the world’s most
energy-efficient commercially available lamp. This
family of six lamps and two spots covers 80% of the
light sockets in the city.

The company broadened the appeal of its Philips Hue
connected lighting system for the home by adding an
innovative motion sensor, which allows users to switch
their Philips Hue lights on and off simply by walking in
or leaving a room

The Philips Hue range was also extended with Philips
Hue white ambiance, providing users with every shade
of white light.

Philips Lighting expanded the number of sports
stadiums using its Philips ArenaVision dynamic LED
pitch lighting, adding the Amsterdam Arena, the
Juventus Stadium in Turin, the Volkswagen Arena in
Wolfsburg and the indoor stadium in Cairo. The
company also provided pitch, fagade and office lighting
for Atletico Madrid. Philips Lighting is responsible for
the pitch lighting of over 65% of stadiums involved in
major international sports events.

Segment performance 35.4

In 2016, approximately 15% of the world’s electricity is
still being used for lighting. Through its digital LED
technology, Philips Lighting offers light that is up to 80%
more energy-efficient than conventional technologies,
which are still commonly used globally. For this reason,
the company has pledged to cumulatively sell 2 billion
LED light bulbs by 2020, for which it has already sold
628 million units thus far. In addition, Philips Lighting
effectively reduced its operational carbon footprint
year-on-year by 20%, also increasing the share of
renewable electricity to 67%. Its solutions to effectively
reduce, recycle, and re-use the waste in its sites as
much as possible resulted in 85% of its total industrial
waste being recycled, as part of its journey towards
zero waste to landfill

Separation of Lighting

In September 2014, Philips announced its plan to
sharpen its strategic focus by establishing two stand-
alone companies focused on the HealthTech and
Lighting opportunities respectively. Before the listing of
Philips Lighting on Euronext in May 2016, astand-alone
structure was established for Philips Lighting within the
Philips Group, effective February 1, 2016. To effectuate
the separation and to provide a framework for the
relationship between the two companies after the
separation, Philips and Philips Lighting entered into a
separation agreement and aset of ancillary agreements
(collectively, the “Separation Agreement”). The
Separation Agreement allocated assets, liabilities,
employees and contracts of the Philips Group between
the current groups of Philips and Philips Lighting. The
separation was guided by the principle that the Philips
Lighting group comprises substantially all of Philips’
former lighting business, related assets and liabilities,
employees and contracts, as well as allocated activities
from the former Innovation, Group & Services sector.
Furthermore, certain historical exposures and liabilities
of the Philips Group were allocated to each of the
groups of Philips and Philips Lighting, which are
unrelated to their respective businesses.

Upon the listing of Philips Lighting in May 2016, Philips
and Philips Lighting also entered into a relationship
agreement (the “Relationship Agreement”) to manage
the continuing relationship between Philips Lighting
and Philips as a large shareholder of Philips Lighting
upon such listing. The Relationship Agreement will
terminate when the stake of Philips falls below 10%
(with the exception of certain specific provisions).

A Reconciliation of non-GAAP

information

Koninklijke Philips N.V. (the ‘Company’) believes that an
understanding of sales performance, capital efficiency,
financial strength and its funding requirements is
enhanced by introducing certain Non-GAAP measures,
such as Comparable sales growth, Adjusted income
from operations / EBITA and Net debt. In this chapter
these measures are further explained and reconciled to
GAAP measures.

Non-GAAP measures referred to in this report are cross
referenced to this chapter.

Comparable sales growth

Comparable sales exclude the effects of currency
movements and changes in consolidation. As indicated
in the note 1, Significant accounting policies, sales and
income are translated from foreign currencies into the
Company’s reporting currency, the euro, at the
exchange rate on transaction dates during the
respective years. As a result of significant currency

movements during the years presented, the effects of
translating foreign currency sales amounts into euros
could have a material impact. Therefore, these impacts
have been excluded in arriving at the comparable sales
in euros. Currency effects have been calculated by
translating previous years’ foreign currency sales
amounts into euros at the following year’s exchange
rates in comparison with the sales in euros as
historically reported. The years under review were
characterized by a number of acquisitions and
divestments, as a result of which activities were
consolidated or deconsolidated. The effect of
consolidation changes has also been excluded in
arriving at the comparable sales. For the purpose of
calculating comparable sales, when a previously
consolidated entity is sold or contributed to a venture
that is not consolidated by the Company, relevant sales
are excluded from impacted prior-year periods.
Similarly, when an entity is acquired, relevant sales are
excluded from impacted periods.

The Company uses the terms EBIT and EBITA to
evaluate the performance of the Philips Group and its
operating segments. The term EBIT has the same
meaning as Income from operations and the term
EBITA has the same meaning as Adjusted income from
operations. EBITA represents income from operations
before amortization and impairment on intangible
assets (excluding software and capitalized
development expenses). Referencing EBITA is
considered appropriate as the Company uses it as one
of its strategic drivers to increase profitability through
re-allocation of its resources towards opportunities

5 Risk management

5.1 Our approach to risk management implementation of appropriate risk responses. Philips’

The Executive Committee, supported by the Risk
Management Support Team, oversees and manages
enterprise risk. The Risk Management Support Team
consists of a number of functional experts covering the
various categories of enterprise risk and supports by
increasing the understanding of the Enterprise Risk
profile and continuously working to improve the
enterprise risk management framework. Management
is the primary responsible for identifying the critical
risks and for the implementation of appropriate risk
responses.

Philips believes risk management is a value creating
activity and as such it is an integral element of the
Philips Business System (PBS). Risk management
supports us in taking sound risk-reward strategic
decisions to maximize value creation, it supports
sustainable results on our Path to Value, it protects our
key strengths (Capabilities, Assets, and Positions) and
it supports process excellence.

Philips’ risk management focuses on the following risk
categories: Strategic, Operational, Compliance and
Financial risks. The main risks within these categories
are further described in section 5.2, Risk categories and
factors, of this Annual Report. The overview highlights
the material risks known to Philips, which could hinder
it in achieving its strategic and financial business
objectives. The risk overview may, however, not include
all the risks that may ultimately affect Philips. Some
risks not yet known to Philips, or currently believed not
to be material, could ultimately have a major impact on
Philips’ businesses, objectives, revenues, income,
assets, liquidity or capital resources.

All forward-looking statements made on or after the
date of this Annual Report and attributable to Philips
are expressly qualified in their entirety by the factors
described in the cautionary statement included in
chapter 16, Forward-looking statements and other
information, of this Annual Report and the overview of
risk factors described in section 5.2, Risk categories and
factors, of this Annual Report.

Risk Management Framework

Risk management and control forms an integral part of
the Philips business planning and performance review
cycle. The company’s risk and control policy is designed
to provide reasonable assurance that objectives are
met by integrating risk assessment in the strategic
planning process, integrating management control into
the daily operations, ensuring compliance with legal
requirements and safeguarding the integrity of the
company’s financial reporting and its related
disclosures. It makes management responsible for
identifying the critical business risks and for the

risk management approach is embedded in the areas
of Corporate Governance, elements of the Philips
Business System (Strategic Investment Decision
Making, Asset Protection, Operational Excellence,
Planning & Performance Cycle), Philips Business
Control Framework and Philips General Business
Principles. The Risk Management Support Team
supports management by assessing the Enterprise Risk
profile and continuously working to improve the
enterprise risk management framework. Structured risk
assessments take place according to the Philips
process standard for managing risk.

Philips’ risk management process addresses risks
related to different categories: Strategic, Operational,
Compliance and Financial risks. The Executive
Committee and management consider risk appetite
when taking decisions and seek to manage risks
consistently within the risk appetite. Risk appetite is
different for the various risk categories:

+ Strategic risks and opportunities may affect Philips’
strategic ambitions. Strategic risks include economic
and political developments and the need to
anticipate and respond timeously to market
circumstances. Philips is prepared to take
considerable strategic risks given the necessity to
invest in research & development and manage the
portfolio of businesses, including acquisitions and
divestments, in a highly uncertain global political and
economic environment.

Operational risks include adverse unexpected
developments resulting from internal processes,
people and systems, or from external events that are
linked to the actual running of each business
(examples are solution and product creation and
supply chain management). Philips aims to minimize
downside risks due to the need for high quality of its
products and services, reliable IT systems and
sustainability commitments.

Compliance risks cover unanticipated failures to
implement, or comply with, appropriate laws,
regulations, policies and procedures. Philips has a
zero tolerance policy towards non-compliance in
relation to breaches of its General Business
Principles.

Financial risk include risks related to Treasury,
Accounting and Reporting, Pensions and Tax. Philips
is prudent with regard to financial risks and the risk
appetite is described in various chapters of this
annual report, including note 30, Details of treasury /
other financial risks.

Philips does not classify these risk categories in order
of importance.

Risk management 5.1

Corporate Governance

Corporate governance is the system by which a
company is directed and controlled. Philips believes
that good corporate governance is a critical factor in
achieving business success. Good corporate
governance derives from, among other things, effective
internal controls and high ethical standards. The quality
of Philips’ system of risk management, business control
and other findings of internal and external audits are
reported to and discussed by the Audit Committee of
the Supervisory Board. Internal auditors monitor the
quality of risk management and business controls
through risk-based operational audits, inspections of
financial reporting controls and compliance audits.

Audit & Risk committees at Group level, Business
Groups, Markets and key Functional areas meet
quarterly, chaired by first line leadership, to address
weaknesses in risk management and business controls
structure as reported by internal and external auditors
or revealed by self-assessment of management and to
take corrective action where necessary. These Audit &
Risk committees are also involved in company-wide
internal audit planning as approved by the Audit
Committee of the Supervisory Board. In addition to the
Audit Committee, the Quality and Regulatory (Q&R)
Committee of the Supervisory Board assists the
Supervisory Board in fulfilling its oversight
responsibilities particularly in respect of the quality of
the Company’s products, systems, services and
software and the development, testing, manufacturing,
marketing and servicing thereof, and regulatory
requirements relating thereto. As such, the Q&R
Committee supports the Company’s risk management
in the relevant risk areas. An in-depth description of
Philips’ corporate governance structure can be found in
chapter 9, Corporate governance, of this Annual
Report.

Risk Management

Taking risks is an inherent part of entrepreneurial
behavior and well-structured risk management allows
management to take risks in a controlled manner. In
order to provide a comprehensive view of Philips’ risks,
structured risk assessments take place according to the
Philips process standard for risk management,
combining elements of a top-down and bottom-up
approach. The process is supported by workshops with
management at Business, Market and Group Function
levels. During 2016, several risk management
workshops were held.

Key elements of the Philips risk management process
are:

+ Annual risk assessment for the Group, Business
Groups, Markets and key Functions as part of the
annual update of the strategic plan. Risks are
assessed and prioritized on their impact on
objectives, likelihood of occurrence and
effectiveness of controls. Management is
accountable for the timely development of effective
risk responses.

Developments in the risk profile and management's
initiatives to improve risk responses are explicitly
discussed and monitored during the quarterly Audit
& Risk Committees and in the Quarterly Performance
Reviews (QPR).

As an integral part of the strategy review, the
Executive Committee annually assesses the
enterprise risk profile, including appropriate risk
scenarios and sensitivity analysis, and reviews the
potential impact of the enterprise risk profile versus
the Group’s risk appetite. This risk assessment is
based on the latest annual risk assessments of the
Group, Business Groups, Markets and key Functions

periodic review meetings, findings from Philips

statements, of this Annual Report, views from key
stakeholders, external analysis, and risks reported in
the annual certification statement on Risk
Management and Business Controls.

Developments in the Enterprise Risk profile and
management's initiatives to improve risk responses
are discussed and monitored during the quarterly
Group Audit & Risk Committee.

The Executive Committee reviews at least annually
the Philips risk management approach and improves
the process as required.

The Philips risk profile and the risk management
approach are discussed at least annually with the
Supervisory Board.

Examples of measures taken to further strengthen the
risk management framework include:

Definition and execution of the Enterprise Risk
Management (ERM) improvement roadmap;
Process standardization for Risk Management,
Internal Control, Compliance and Audit processes as
part of the Philips Excellence Process Framework
(PEPF) to drive efficiency and continuous
improvement;

The establishment of an Information Security Office
and Program in light of the increasing exposure to
cybercrime and information security requirements
resulting from digitalization and a focus on the
Healthcare industry;

The development of risk management related to
long-term strategic partnership given the growing
importance of service-based business models.

Philips Business Control Framework

The Philips Business Control Framework (BCF) sets the
standard for risk management and business control in
Philips. The objectives of the BCF are to maintain
integrated management control of the company’s
operations, in order to ensure the integrity of the
financial reporting, as well as compliance with laws and
regulations. Philips has designed its BCF based on the
“Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)”
established by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Philips continuously evaluates and improves its BCF to
align with business dynamics and good practice.

As part of the BCF, Philips has implemented a global
standard for internal control over financial reporting
(ICS). ICS, together with Philips’ established accounting
procedures, is designed to provide reasonable
assurance that assets are safeguarded, that the books
and records properly reflect transactions necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements, that policies
and procedures are carried out by qualified personnel
and that published financial statements are properly
prepared and do not contain any material
misstatements. ICS has been deployed in all material
reporting units, where business process owners
perform an extensive number of controls, document
the results each quarter, and take corrective action

Risk management 5.1

where necessary. ICS supports business and functional
management in a quarterly cycle of assessment and
monitoring of its control environment. The findings of
management's evaluation are reported to the
Executive Committee and the Supervisory Board
quarterly.

As part of the Annual Report process, management's
accountability for business controls is enforced through
the formal issuance of a Statement on Business
Controls and a Letter of Representation by Business
Group, Market and Functional management to the
Executive Committee. Any deficiencies noted in the
design and operating effectiveness of controls over
financial reporting which were not completely
remediated are evaluated at year-end by the Board of
Management. The Board of Management's report,
including its conclusions regarding the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, can be found
in section 10.1, Management's report on internal
control, of this Annual Report.

Philips General Business Principles

The Philips General Business Principles (GBP)
incorporate the fundamental principles for all Philips
businesses around the globe. They set the minimum
standard for business conduct, both for individual
employees and for the company and our subsidiaries.
Our GBP also stand as a reference for the business
conduct we expect from our business partners and
suppliers. Translations of the text are available in 32
languages, allowing almost every employee to read the
GBP in their native language. Detailed underlying
policies, manuals, training and tools are in place to give
employees practical guidance on how to apply the GBP
in their day-to-day work environments.

In addition, there are separate Codes of Ethics that
apply to employees working in specific areas of our
business, i.e. the Procurement Code of Ethics and the
Financial Code of Ethics. Details can be found at:
www.philips.com/gbp.

As part of our unyielding effort to raise GBP awareness
and create engagement throughout the organization,
each year a GBP communications and training plan is
deployed. In 2016, a number of new initiatives were
undertaken through various channels such as Quick
Reference Cards for at-a-glance guidance on how to
handle a number of common GBP concerns, as well as
returning programs such as e-Learnings for selected
high-risk audiences. Many of these initiatives
contributed to building momentum toward our now
annual GBP Dialogue Week in October. During 2016's
Dialogue Week, hundreds of Philips teams held open
and frank discussions on what Acting with Integrity
means to them, and posted pictures of their sessions on
the Philips social platform using the hashtag
#integritymatters.

Risk management 5.1

The GBP form an integral part of labor contracts in
virtually every country in which Philips operates. Itis the
responsibility of each employee to live up to our GBP,
and employees are requested to affirm their
commitment after completing their GBP e-training. In
addition, employees in the respective specialized areas
must sign off on the Financial and Supply Management
Codes of Ethics. Executives are requested to sign off on
the GBP each year to reaffirm their awareness of and
compliance with them.

The GBP Review Committee is responsible for the
effective deployment of the GBP and for generally
promoting a culture of compliance and ethics within
Philips. The GBP Review Committee is chaired by the
Chief Legal Officer, and its members include the Chief
HR Officer, the Chief Market Leader and the Chief
Financial Officer. They are supported in the
implementation of their initiatives by a Committee
Secretariat, and a network of GBP Compliance Officers,
who are appointed in all markets, countries and at all
major sites where Philips has operations.

Related roles and responsibilities are laid down in the
Charter of the GBP Review Committee. In 2016, in
response to external regulatory developments in
business ethics and compliance, a revised charter was
deployed by the GBP Review Committee. This newly
updated charter impacted the composition of the GBP
Review Committee, the roles and responsibilities of its
members as well as the composition, roles and
responsibilities of the GBP Compliance function. To
strengthen monitoring and oversight of GBP.
compliance within Philips, the mandatory annual GBP
self-assessment questionnaire, part of our Internal
Control framework, was completely renewed. The GBP
Review Committee Secretariat receives an overview of
the results of this self-assessment and can take action
when deemed necessary. We believe this has created
amore robust network equipped with the requisite
skills and support to monitor and enhance compliance
in the increasingly regulated environments in which
Philips operates.

The GBP are supported by established mechanisms
that ensure standardized reporting and escalation of
concerns. These mechanisms are based on the GBP
Reporting Policy that urges employees to report any
concerns they may have regarding business conduct in
relation to the GBP, either through a GBP Compliance
Officer or through the Philips Ethics Line. The Philips
Ethics Line enables employees and also third parties to
report a concern either by telephone or online ina
variety of different languages 24/7 all year round. All
concerns raised are registered consistently in a single
database hosted outside Philips by a third party and are
investigated systematically in accordance with
standardized investigation procedures.

Annual Report 2016

Financial Code of Ethics

The Company recognizes that its businesses have
responsibilities within the communities in which they
operate. The Company has a Financial Code of Ethics
which applies to the CEO (the principal executive
officer) and CFO (the principal financial and principal
accounting officer), and to the senior management in
the Philips Finance Leadership Team who head the
Finance departments of the Company. The Company
has published its Financial Code of Ethics within the
investor section of its website located at
www.philips.com. No changes were considered
necessary and no changes have been made to the
Financial Code of Ethics since its adoption and no
waivers have been granted therefrom to the officers
mentioned above in 2016.

5.2 Risk categories and factors

In order to provide a comprehensive view of Philips’
enterprise risks, structured risk assessments take place
in accordance with the Philips process standard to
manage risk as described in section 5.1, Our approach
to risk management, of this Annual Report. As a result
of this process, amongst others, the following actions
were performed during 2016:

Philips completed the separation of its Lighting
business and subsequently listed Philips Lighting on
the Amsterdam stock exchange and sold a portion of
its ownership. This separation has eliminated the
separation risk discussed in the 2015 Annual Report.
Until the completion of the sale of its entire
ownership in Philips Lighting, Philips remains
exposed to risks with regard to the value of Philips
Lighting.

The challenging global political and economic
developments had an impact on our results. Even
though the management of risks related to these
developments has not changed compared to 2015,
we continuously monitor the impact on our risk
profile.

Philips describes the risk factors within each risk
category in order of Philips’ current view of expected
significance, to give stakeholders an insight into which
risks and opportunities it considers more prominent
than others at present. The risk overview highlights the
main risks and opportunities known to Philips, which
could hinder it in achieving its strategic and financial
business objectives. The risk overview may, however,
not include all the risks that may ultimately affect
Philips. Describing risk factors in their order of expected
significance within each risk category does not mean
that a lower listed risk factor may not have a material
and adverse impact on Philips’ business, strategic
objectives, revenues, income, assets, liquidity, capital
resources or achievement of Philips’ goals.
Furthermore, a risk factor described after other risk
factors may ultimately prove to have more significant
adverse consequences than those other risk factors.
Over time Philips may change its view as to the relative
significance of each risk factor.

5.3 Strategic risks

Philips may be unable to adapt swiftly to changes in
industry or market circumstances, which could have a
material adverse impact on its financial condition and
results.

Fundamental shifts in the Healthcare and/or Lighting
industries, like the transition towards digital, may
drastically change the business environment. If Philips
is unable to recognize these changes in good time, is
late in adjusting its business models, or if circumstances
arise such as pricing actions by competitors, then this
could have a material adverse effect on Philips’ growth
ambitions, financial condition and operating result.

As Philips’ business is global, its operations are exposed
to economic and political developments in countries
across the world that could adversely impact its
revenues and income.

Philips’ business environment is influenced by political
and economic conditions in individual and global
markets. Philips experienced the impact from changes
in macro-economic development in various
geographies during 2016. Economic growth in China
was markedly lower compared to average growth over
the last two decades. The economic growth of countries
which are highly dependent on revenues from energy,
raw materials and commodities remains adversely
affected by the slowdown of growth in China, most
strongly in emerging market countries. Low revenues
from oil also affected countries in the Middle East
where public spending has been dramatically reduced.
Monetary interventions by the European Central Bank
did not result in any increase of inflation nor in stronger
economic growth in the European Union in 2016. The
consensus economic outlook for Great Britain as well
as for the European Union has become less favorable
as a result of the Brexit vote in June 2016. Although the
US economy continued to perform well during 2016, the
result of the US presidential election and potential
changes in US economic and monetary policies (i.e.
expected further rate hikes) may have an impact not
only on US dollar but also on a range of emerging
market currencies. Both Brexit and the policies of the

new US administration may have significant impact on
international trade tariffs and customs laws. The
disparate macroeconomic outlook for the main
geographies, political conflicts and the unknown
impact of Eurozone monetary policy continue to create
uncertainty as to the levels of (public) capital
expenditures in general, unemployment levels and
consumer and business confidence, which could
adversely affect demand for products and services
offered by Philips. These economic conditions may
have an adverse effect on financial markets, which
could affect the ability of Philips to make strategic
divestments at reasonable price levels or within a
reasonable period of time.

The general global political environment remains
unfavorable for the business environment due to a rise
in political conflicts and terrorism. Numerous other
factors, such as sustained lower levels of energy and
raw material prices, regional political conflicts in the
Middle East, Turkey, Russia and Ukraine and other
regions, as well as large-scale (in)voluntary migration
and profound social instability could continue to impact
macroeconomic factors and the international capital
and credit markets. The new US administration may
implement changes in, among others, US foreign policy,
healthcare, trade and tax laws, the impact of which
cannot be predicted. Uncertainty on the timing and the
nature of Brexit may adversely affect economic growth
and the business environment in the United Kingdom
and the rest of the European Union. Elections ina
number of key European countries during 2017, which
could trigger additional exits from the European Union,
may have a similar adverse impact. Economic and
political uncertainty may have a material adverse
impact on Philips’ financial condition or results of
operations and can also make it more difficult for Philips
to budget and forecast accurately. Philips may
encounter difficulty in planning and managing
operations due to the lack of adequate infrastructure
and unfavorable political factors, including unexpected
legal or regulatory changes such as foreign exchange
import or export controls, increased healthcare
regulation, nationalization of assets or restrictions on
the repatriation of returns from foreign investments.
Given that growth in emerging market countries is
correlated to US and European economic growth and
that such emerging market countries are increasingly
important in Philips’ operations, the above-mentioned
risks are also expected to grow and could have a
material adverse effect on Philips’ financial condition
and operating results.

Philips’ overall risk profile will be changing as a result of
the focus on Health Technology.

The risk profile of Philips will change as and when
Philips Lighting is sold and deconsolidated. The risk
profile is expected to shift towards risks generally
associated to Health Technology companies.

Annual Report 2016

Philips’ overall performance in the coming years is
expected to depend on the realization of its growth
ambitions in growth geographies.

Growth geographies are becoming increasingly
important in the global market. In addition, Asia is an
important production, sourcing and design center for
Philips. Philips faces strong competition to attract the
best talent in tight labor markets and intense
competition from local companies as well as other
global players for market share in growth geographies.
Philips needs to maintain and grow its position in
growth geographies, invest in data driven services,
invest in local talent, understand developments in end-
user preferences and localize the portfolio in order to
stay competitive. If Philips fails to achieve these
objectives, then this could have a material adverse
effect on growth ambitions, financial condition and
operating result.

The growth ambitions of Philips may be adversely
affected by economic volatility inherent in growth
geographies and the impact of changes in
macroeconomic circumstances on growth economies.

Philips may not control joint ventures or associated
companies in which it invests, which could limit the
ability of Philips to identify and manage risks.

Philips has invested and may invest in joint ventures
and associated companies in which Philips will have a
non-controlling interest. In these cases, Philips has
limited influence over, and limited or no control of, the
governance, performance and cost of operations of
joint ventures and associated companies. Some of
these joint ventures and associated companies may
represent significant investments and potentially also
use Philips’ brand. The joint ventures and associated
companies that Philips does not control may make
business, financial or investment decisions contrary to
Philips’ interests or may make decisions different from
those that Philips itself may have made. Additionally,
Philips partners or members of a joint venture or
associated company may not be able to meet their
financial or other obligations, which could expose
Philips to additional financial or other obligations, as
well as having a material adverse effect on the value of
its investments in those entities or potentially subject
Philips to additional claims. Lumileds and Philips
Lighting are examples of companies in which Philips
may continue to have a significant (residual) interest but
may not have control.

Acquisitions could expose Philips to integration risks
and challenge management in continuing to reduce the
complexity of the company.

Philips’ acquisitions may expose Philips in the future to
integration risks in areas such as sales and service force
integration, logistics, regulatory compliance,
information technology and finance. Integration
difficulties and complexity may adversely impact the


--- Page 55 ---

5.4

realization of an increased contribution from
acquisitions. Philips may incur significant acquisition,
administrative and other costs in connection with these
transactions, including costs related to the integration
of acquired businesses.

Furthermore, organizational simplification expected to
be implemented following an acquisition and the
resulting cost savings may be difficult to achieve.
Acquisitions may also lead to a substantial increase in
long-lived assets, including goodwill. Write-downs of
these assets due to unforeseen business developments
may have a material adverse effect on Philips’ earnings
(see also note 11, Goodwill).

Philips’ inability to secure and maintain intellectual
property rights for products, whilst maintaining overall
competitiveness, could have a material adverse effect
on its results.

Philips is dependent on its ability to obtain and
maintain licenses and other intellectual property (IP)
rights covering its products and its design and
manufacturing processes. The IP portfolio is the result
of an extensive patenting process that could be
influenced by a number of factors, including innovation.
The value of the IP portfolio is dependent on the
successful promotion and market acceptance of
standards developed or co-developed by Philips. This
is particularly applicable to Personal Health where
third-party licenses are important and a loss or
impairment could have a material adverse impact on
Philips’ financial condition and operating results.

Operational risks

Failure to comply with quality standards and
regulations can trigger warranty and product liability
claims against Philips and can lead to financial losses
and adversely impact Philips’ reputation, market share
and brand.

Philips is required to comply with the highest standards
of quality in the manufacture of its medical devices.
Philips hereto is subject to the supervision of various
national regulatory authorities. Conditions imposed by
such national regulatory authorities could result in
product recalls or a temporary ban on products and/or
production facilities. In addition such quality issues
and/or liability claims could affect Philips’ reputation
and its relationships with key customers (both
customers for end products and customers that use
Philips’ products in their production process). As a
result, depending on the product and manufacturing
site concerned and the severity of the objection, this
could lead to financial losses through lost revenue and
costs of any required remedial actions, and have further
impacts on Philips’ reputation, market share and brand.

Philips has observed a global increase in IT security
threats and higher levels of sophistication in computer
crime, posing a risk to the confidentiality, availability
and integrity of data and information.

Risk management 53

The global increase in security threats and higher levels
of professionalism in computer crime have increased
the importance of effective IT security measures,
including proper identity management processes to
protect against unauthorized systems access.
Nevertheless, Philips’ systems, networks, products,
solutions and services remain vulnerable to attacks,
which could lead to the leakage of confidential
information, improper use of its systems and networks
or defective products, which could in turn have a
material adverse effect on Philips’ financial condition
and operating results. In recent years, the risks that we
and other companies face from cyber-attacks have
increased significantly. The objectives of these cyber-
attacks vary widely and may include, among things,
disruptions of operations including provision of services
to customers or theft of intellectual property or other
sensitive information belonging to us or other business
partners. Successful cyber-attacks may result in
substantial costs and other negative consequences,
which may include, but are not limited to, lost revenues,
reputational damage, remediation costs, and other
liabilities to customers and partners. Furthermore,
enhanced protection measures can involve significant
costs. Although we have experienced cyber-attacks
and to date have not incurred any significant damage
as a result and did not incur significant monetary cost
in taking corrective action, there can be no assurance
that in the future Philips will be as successful in avoiding
damages from cyber-attacks, which could lead to
financial losses. Additionally, the integration of new
companies and successful outsourcing of business
processes are highly dependent on secure and well
controlled IT systems.

Diversity in information technology (IT) could result in
ineffective or inefficient business management. IT
outsourcing and off-shoring strategies could result in
complexities in service delivery and contract
management.

Philips continuously seeks to create a more open,
standardized and cost-effective IT landscape, including
through further outsourcing, off-shoring,
commoditization and ongoing reduction in the number
of IT systems. These changes create risk with regard to
the delivery of IT services, the availability of IT systems
and the scope and nature of the functionality offered
by IT systems.

Transformation programs

In 2011, Philips began a transformation program
(Accelerate!) designed to unlock Philips’ full potential.
In 2014, as a next phase in the Accelerate!
transformation program, Philips announced its plan to
sharpen its strategic focus by establishing two stand-
alone companies focused on the HealthTech and
Lighting opportunities respectively. The Lighting
business was separated in 2016, with Philips selling a
portion of its ownership stake and Philips Lighting
becoming listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange

Annual Report 2016 61


--- Page 56 ---

62

Risk management 5.4

Failure to achieve the objectives of any transformation
program may have a material adverse effect on the
mid-term and long-term financial targets.

In addition, any transformation program in relation to
the Finance function may expose Philips to adverse
changes in the quality of its systems of internal control.

If Philips is unable to ensure effective supply chain
management, e.g. facing an interruption of its supply
chain, including the inability of third parties to deliver
parts, components and services on time, and if it is
subject to rising raw material prices, it may be unable
to sustain its competitiveness in its markets.

Philips is continuing the process of creating a leaner
supply base with fewer suppliers, while maintaining
dual/multiple sourcing strategies where possible. This
strategy very much requires close cooperation with
suppliers to enhance, among other things, time to
market and quality. In addition, Philips is continuing its
initiatives to replace internal capabilities with less
costly outsourced products and services. These
processes may result in increased dependency on
external suppliers and providers. Although Philips
works closely with its suppliers to avoid supply-related
problems, there can be no assurance that it will not
encounter supply problems in the future or that it will
be able to replace a supplier that is not able to meet its
demand sufficiently quickly to avoid disruptions.

Shortages or delays could materially harm its business.
Most of Philips’ activities are conducted outside of the
Netherlands, and international operations bring
challenges. For example, Philips depends partly on the
production and procurement of products and parts
from Asian countries, and this constitutes a risk that
production and shipping of products and parts could be
interrupted by regional conflicts, a natural disaster or
extreme weather events resulting from climate
changes. A general shortage of materials, components
or subcomponents as a result of natural disasters also
poses the risk of unforeseeable fluctuations in prices
and demand, which could have a material adverse
effect on Philips’ financial condition and operating
results.

Businesses purchase raw materials, including so-called
rare earth metals, copper, steel, aluminum, noble gases
and oil-related products, which exposes them to
fluctuations in energy and raw material prices. In recent
times, commodities have been subject to volatile
markets, and such volatility is expected to continue. If
Philips is not able to compensate for increased costs or
pass them on to customers, price increases could have
a material adverse impact on Philips’ results. In
contrast, in times of falling commodity prices, Philips
may not fully benefit from such price decreases, since
Philips attempts to reduce the risk of rising commodity
prices by several means, including long-term
contracting or physical and financial hedging.

Annual Report 2016

Failure to achieve improvements in Philips’ solution
and product creation process and/or increased speed
in innovation-to-market could hamper Philips’
profitable growth ambitions.

Further improvements in Philips’ solution and product
creation process, ensuring timely delivery of new
solutions and products at lower cost and improvement
in customer service levels to create sustainable
competitive advantages, are important in realizing
Philips’ profitable growth ambitions. The emergence of
new low-cost competitors, particularly in Asia, further
underlines the importance of improvements in the
product creation process. The success of new solution
and product creation, however, depends on a number
of factors, including timely and successful completion
of development efforts, market acceptance, Philips’
ability to manage the risks associated with new
products and production ramp-up issues, the ability of
Philips to attract and retain employees with the
appropriate skills, the availability of products in the
right quantities and at appropriate costs to meet
anticipated demand and the risk that new products and
services may have quality or other defects in the early
stages of introduction. Accordingly, Philips cannot
determine in advance the ultimate effect that new
solutions and product creations will have on its financial
condition and operating results. If Philips fails to create
and commercialize products or fails to ensure that end-
user insights are translated into solution and product
creations that improve product mix and consequently
contribution, it may lose its market share and
competitiveness, which could have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition and operating results.

Because Philips is dependent on its personnel for
leadership and specialized skills, the loss of its ability to
attract and retain such personnel would have an
adverse effect on its business.

The attraction and retention of talented employees in
sales and marketing, research and development,
finance and general management, as well as of highly
specialized technical personnel, especially in
transferring technologies to low-cost countries, is
critical to Philips’ success particularly in times of
economic recovery. The loss of specialized skills could
also result in business interruptions. There can be no
assurance that Philips will be successful in attracting
and retaining highly qualified employees and key
personnel needed in the future.

Risk of unauthorized use of intellectual property rights.

Philips produces and sells products and services which
incorporate technology protected by intellectual
property rights. Philips develops and acquires
intellectual property rights on a regular basis. Philips is
exposed to the risk that a third party may claim to own
the intellectual property rights on technology applied
in Philips products and services and that in the event


--- Page 57 ---

5.5

that their claims of infringement of these intellectual
property rights are successful, they may be entitled to
damages and Philips could incur a fine.

Any damage to Philips’ reputation could have an
adverse effect on its businesses and brand.

Philips is exposed to developments which could affect
its reputation. Such developments could be of an
environmental or social nature, connected to the
behavior of individual employees or suppliers, or could
relate to adherence to regulations related to labor,
health and safety, environmental and chemical
management. Reputational damage could materially
impact Philips’ brand value, financial condition and
operating results.

Compliance risks
Philips is exposed to non-compliance with product
safety laws and data privacy.

Philips’ brand image and reputation would be
adversely impacted by non-compliance with various
product safety laws and data protection. In light of
Philips’ digital strategy, data privacy laws are
increasingly important. Also, Diagnosis & Treatment
and Connected Care & Health Informatics are subject to
various (patient) data protection and safety laws. In
Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care & Health
Informatics, privacy and product safety and security
issues may arise, especially with respect to remote
access or monitoring of patient data or loss of data on
our customers’ systems. Philips is exposed to the risk
that its products, including components or materials
procured from suppliers, may prove to be not compliant
with safety laws, e.g. chemical safety regulations. Such
non-compliance could result in a ban on the sale or use
of these products.

Philips operates in a highly regulated product safety
and quality environment. Philips’ products are subject
to regulation by various government agencies,
including the FDA (US) and comparable foreign
agencies. Obtaining their approval is costly and time
consuming, but a prerequisite for introducing products
in the market. A delay or inability to obtain the
necessary regulatory approvals for new products could
have a material adverse effect on business. The risk
exists that product safety incidents or user concerns
could trigger FDA business reviews which, if failed,
could lead to business interruption which in turn could
adversely affect Philips’ financial condition and
operating results. For example the voluntary
suspension in 2014 of new production at our Healthcare
facility in Cleveland, Ohio targeted to further strengthen
manufacturing process controls after certain issues in
this area were identified during an ongoing FDA
inspection.

Risk management 5.4

Philips’ global presence exposes the company to
regional and local regulatory rules, changes to which
may affect the realization of business opportunities and
investments in the countries in which Philips operates.

Philips has established subsidiaries in over 80
countries. These subsidiaries are exposed to changes in
governmental regulations and unfavorable political
developments, which may affect the realization of
business opportunities or impair Philips’ local
investments. Philips’ increased focus on the healthcare
sector increases its exposure to highly regulated
markets, where obtaining clearances or approvals for
new products is of great importance, and where there
is adependency on the available funding for healthcare
systems. In addition, changes in government
reimbursement policies may affect spending on
healthcare.

Philips is exposed to governmental investigations and
legal proceedings with regard to possible anti-
competitive market practices.

National and European authorities are increasingly
focused on possible anti-competitive market practices.
Philips’ financial position and results could be
materially affected by an adverse final outcome of
governmental investigations and litigation, as well as
any potential related claims.

Legal proceedings covering a range of matters are
pending in various jurisdictions against Philips and its
current and former group companies. Due to the
uncertainty inherent in legal proceedings, it is difficult
to predict the final outcome.

Philips, including a certain number of its current and
former group companies, is involved in legal
proceedings relating to such matters as competition
issues, commercial transactions, product liability,
participations and environmental pollution. Since the
ultimate outcome of asserted claims and proceedings,
or the impact of any claims that may be asserted in the
future, cannot be predicted with certainty, Philips’
financial position and results of operations could be
affected materially by adverse outcomes.

Please refer to note 25, Contingent assets and
liabilities, for additional disclosure relating to specific
legal proceedings.

Philips is exposed to non-compliance with business
conduct rules and regulations.

Philips’ attempts to realize its growth ambitions could
expose it to the risk of non-compliance with business
conduct rules and regulations, such as anti-bribery
provisions. This risk is heightened in growth
geographies as the legal and regulatory environment is
less developed in growth geographies compared to
mature geographies. Examples include commission
payments to third parties, remuneration payments to

Risk management 5.5

agents, distributors, consultants and the like, and the
acceptance of gifts, which may be considered in some
markets to be normal local business practice (See also
note 25, Contingent assets and liabilities).

Defective internal controls would adversely affect our
financial reporting and management process.

The reliability of reporting is important in ensuring that
management decisions for steering the businesses and
managing both top-line and bottom-line growth are
based on reliable data. Flaws in internal control
systems could adversely affect the financial position
and results and hamper expected growth

Accurate disclosures provide investors and other
market professionals with significant information for a
better understanding of Philips’ businesses.
Imperfections or lack of clarity in disclosures could
create market uncertainty regarding the reliability of the
data presented and could have a negative impact on
the Philips share price.

The reliability of revenue and expenditure data is key
for steering the business and for managing top-line and
bottom-line growth. The long lifecycle of healthcare
sales, from order acceptance to accepted installation,
together with the complexity of the accounting rules for
when revenue can be recognized in the accounts,
presents a challenge in terms of ensuring there is
consistency of application of the accounting rules
throughout Philips’ global business.

Financial risks
Philips is exposed to uncertainty on the timing and
proceeds of a sale of Philips Lighting

In 2016, Philips separated its Lighting business and on
May 27, 2016, Philips Lighting was listed on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Since then Philips Lighting
operates as a separate listed company. Philips has
subsequently sold down part of its ownership in Philips
Lighting. Philips’ overall objective is to fully divest its
ownership of Philips Lighting. The nature or form, timing
and the level of proceeds from this divestment process
are uncertain. The timing and level of proceeds will
depend on general market conditions and investor
appetite for companies of this size and nature. During
this process Philips may lose control over Philips
Lighting and deconsolidate the assets, liabilities and
financial results of Philips Lighting

Philips is exposed to a variety of treasury risks and other
financial risks including liquidity risk, currency risk,
interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk,
country risk and other insurable risk.

Negative developments impacting the liquidity of
global capital markets could affect the ability of Philips
to raise or re-finance debt in the capital markets or
could lead to significant increases in the cost of such
borrowing in the future. If the markets expect a

Annual Report 2016

downgrade or downgrades by the rating agencies or if
such a downgrade has actually taken place, this could
increase the cost of borrowing, reduce our potential
investor base and adversely affect our business.

Philips operates in over 100 countries and its earnings
and equity are therefore inevitably exposed to
fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies
against the euro. Philips’ sales are sensitive in particular
to movements in the US dollar, Japanese yen anda
wide range of other currencies from developed and
emerging markets. Philips’ sourcing and manufacturing
spend is concentrated in the Eurozone, United States
and China. Income from operations is sensitive to
movements in currencies from countries where the
Group has no manufacturing/sourcing activities or only
has manufacturing/sourcing activities on a small scale
such as Japan, Canada, Australia and Great Britain and
in a range of emerging markets such as Russia, Korea,
Indonesia, India and Brazil

The credit risk of financial and non-financial
counterparties with outstanding payment obligations
creates exposures for Philips, particularly in relation to
accounts receivable with customers and liquid assets
and fair values of derivatives and insurance receivables
contracts with financial counterparties. A default by
counterparties in such transactions can have a material
adverse effect on Philips’ financial condition and
operating results.

Philips’ supply chain is exposed to fluctuations in
energy and raw material prices. Commodities such as
oil are subject to volatile markets and significant price
increases from time to time. If Philips is not able to
compensate for, or pass on in good time, its increased
costs to customers, such price increases could have an
adverse impact on its financial condition and operating
results.

Philips is exposed to interest rate risk, particularly in
relation to its long-term debt position; this risk can take
the form of either fair value or cash flow risk. Failure to
effectively hedge this risk can impact Philips’ financial
condition and operating results.

For further analysis, please refer to note 30, Details of
treasury / other financial risks.

Philips is exposed to tax uncertainties, which could
have a significant financial impact.

Philips is exposed to tax uncertainties, which could
result in double taxation, penalties and interest
payments. These include transfer pricing uncertainties
on internal cross-border deliveries of goods and
services, tax uncertainties related to acquisitions and
divestments, tax uncertainties related to the use of tax
credits and permanent establishments, tax
uncertainties relating to tax loss and tax credits carried
forward and potential changes in tax law that could
result in higher tax expenses and payments. The


--- Page 59 ---

uncertainties may have a significant impact on local
financial tax results which in turn could adversely affect
Philips’ financial condition and operating results.

The value of the tax losses carried forward is subject to
availability of sufficient taxable income within the tax
loss-carry-forward period, but also availability of
sufficient taxable income within the foreseeable future
in the case of tax losses carried forward with an
indefinite carry-forward period. The ultimate
realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets,
including tax losses and tax credits carried forward, is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable
income in the countries where the temporary
differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits
were incurred and on periods during which the deferred
tax assets become deductible. Additionally, in certain
instances, realization of such deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the successful execution of tax
planning strategies. Accordingly, there can be no
absolute assurance that all (net) tax losses and credits
carried forward will be realized.

For further details, please refer to the tax risks
paragraph in note 8, Income taxes.

Philips has defined-benefit pension plans and other
post-retirement plans in a number of countries. The
funded status and the cost of maintaining these plans
are influenced by movements in financial market and
demographic developments, creating volatility in
Philips’ financials.

A significant proportion of (former) employees in
Europe and North and Latin America is covered by
defined-benefit pension plans and other post-
retirement plans. The accounting for such plans
requires management to make estimates on
assumptions such as discount rates, inflation, longevity,
expected cost of medical care and expected rates of
compensation. Movements (e.g. due to the movements
of financial markets) in these assumptions can have a
significant impact on the Defined Benefit Obligation
and net interest cost. A negative performance of the
financial markets could have a material impact on cash
funding requirements and net interest cost and also
affect the value of certain financial assets and liabilities
of the company.

Philips is exposed to uncertainty on the timing and
proceeds of the sale of Lumileds.

On January 22, 2016, Philips announced the
termination of its agreement with GO Scale Capital to
sell a stake of 80.1% in Lumileds due to the inability to
mitigate regulatory concerns in the US. Philips
subsequently engaged with other parties and on
December 12, 2016, Philips announced that it had
signed an agreement to sell an 80.1% interest in
Lumileds to certain funds managed by affiliates of
Apollo Global Management, LLC. Subject to regulatory
approvals and completion of other closing obligations

Risk management 5.6

Philips expects to receive cash proceeds, before tax
and transaction-related costs, of approximately USD
1.5 billion and participating preferred equity. As part of
the agreement, Philips will retain a 19.9% interest in the
equity of Lumileds by means of common shares for a
minimum period of three years following completion of
the transaction, subject to the customary drag-along
and tag-along conditions or an IPO. There are no voting
rights associated with the participating preferred equity
held by Philips.

Philips is exposed to a number of reporting risks.

Arisk rating is assigned for each risk identified, based
on the likelihood of occurrence and the potential
impact of the risk on the financial statements and
related disclosures. In determining the probability that
a risk will result in a misstatement of a more than
inconsequential amount or of a material nature, the
following factors are considered to be critical:
complexity of the associated accounting activity or
transaction process, history of accounting and
reporting errors, likelihood of significant (contingent)
liabilities arising from activities, exposure to losses,
existence of a related party transaction, volume of
activity and homogeneity of the individual transactions
processed, and changes in accounting characteristics in
the prior period compared to the period before that.

For important critical reporting risk areas identified
within Philips we refer to the “Use of estimates” section
in note 1, Significant accounting policies, as the
Company assessed that reporting risk is closely related
to the use of estimates and application of judgment.
