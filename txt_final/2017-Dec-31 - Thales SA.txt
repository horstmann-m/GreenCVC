[b|_ Proposed fo the Shareholders’ Meeting on 23 May 2018

New orders in 2017 amounted to €14,920 million, down 10% compared
to the high level recorded in 2016, which was boosted by the
Q3 2016 booking of the 36 Rafale fighter aircraft contract ordered by
the Indian government. The Group has therefore exceeded the
€14 billion order intake target set at the start of 2017. The strong order
momentum in Transport and Defence & Security enabled the Group
to offset the slowdown of orders in Space. At 31 December 2017, the
Group's order book stood at €31,914 million, which represents almost
2 years’ worth of sales

Sales came in at €15,795 million, up 6.1% on a reported basis, and
up 7.2% at constant scope and currency ("organic” change]. Sales
benefitted from both a high rate of growth in emerging markets!
organic growth of +10.3%, running at more than 10% for the fourth
consecutive year) and a marked upturn in organic growth in mature
markets!"! (+5.8%, after +3.9% in 2016 and +0.5% in 2015)

In 2017, consolidated EBIT was €1,543 million (9.8% of sales) compared
to €1,354 million (9.1% of sales} in 2016, up 14%. All operating
segments contributed to this increase and improved their EBIT margin

As such, the Group noticeably exceeded all the financial objectives it
had set for 2017: an order intake of around €14 billion, a mid-single
digit organic sales growth, and an EBIT of between €1,480 million
and €1,500 million, up 9% to 11% on 2016, based on February 2017
scope and exchange rates

At €982 million, adjusted net income, Group share rose 9%. Its increase
was held back by one-off items relating to tax reforms in France and the
United States.

Consolidated net income, Group share was €822 million. It posted a
fall of 13%, affected by the sharp fall in capital gains on disposal of
assets

At €1,365 million compared to €954 million in 2016, free operating
cash flow reached a record level, benefiting from the rise in adjusted
net income, from a slight reduction in operating investments (€431 million

compared to €472 million in 2016) and from a combination of
items that improved the change in working capital requirement.
At 31 December 2017, net cash was €2,971 million, up more than
€600 million compared to 31 December 2016.

1.1.1.2 Presentation of financial
information

Accounting policies

The Thales group's consolidated financial statements are prepared in
accordance with IFRS [International Financial Reporting Standards) as
approved by the European Union at 31 December 2017.

These principles, described in Note 13, are consistent with those
applied for the year ended 31 December 2016. In particular, the new
mandatory standards applicable as from | January 2017 (amendments
to IAS 12 — Income Tax and annual improvements 2013-2016), have
no impact on the Group's financial statements.

Non-GAAP financial indicators

In order to facilitate monitoring and benchmarking of its financial and
operating performance, the Group presents three key non-GAAP
indicators, which exclude non-operating and/or non-recurring items.
They are determined as follows:

e EBIT, an adjusted operating indicator, corresponds to income from
operations plus the share in the net income of equity-accounted
companies, before the impact of entries relating to the amortisation
of intangible assets acquired (purchase price allocation — PPA)
recorded as part of business combinations. From | January 2016,
it also excludes the other expenses recorded in income from
operations that are directly related to business combinations, which
are unusual by nature

(I) "Mature markets” include Europe, North America, Ausralia and New Zealand; “emerging markets” include all other counties.

THALES — 2017 Registration Document


--- Page 2 ---

This definition drives the definition of other operating indicator on the

adjusted P&L

= adjusted gross margin corresponds to the difference between
sales and the cost of sales, less expenses recorded in cost of
sales that are directly related to business combinations, which are
unusual by nature,

= adjusted indirect costs correspond to the indirect costs on the
consolidated profit and loss account (research and development
expenses, marketing and selling expenses, general and administrative
expenses], less expenses recorded as part of these expenses and
that are directly related to business combinations, which are unusual
by nature;

adjusted net income corresponds to net income, excluding the

following items and net of the corresponding tax effects:

= amortisation of acquired intangible assets (PPA) recorded as part
of business combinations,

= expenses recognised in income from operations, that are directly
related to business combinations, which are unusual by nature,

= goins and losses on disposals of assets, changes in scope of
consolidation and other,

= changes in the fair value of derivative foreign exchange instruments
[recognised under "Other financial income and expenses” in the
consolidated financial statements),

= actuarial gains (losses) on longterm benefits (recognised under
“Finance costs on pensions and other longterm employee
benefits” in the consolidated financial statements);

Management report — 2017 Financial Information

free operating cash flow corresponds to the net cash flow from
operating activities before contributions to reduce the pension deficit
in the United Kingdom, and after deducting net operating investments.

Readers are reminded that only the consolidated financial statements at
31 December were audited by the statutory auditors, including the
calculation of EBIT, which is described in Note 2 “Segment Information"
to the consolidated financial statements, and free operating cash flow,
which is described and computed in Note 6.4. Adjusted financial
information other than that provided in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements is subject to the verification procedures applicable
to all information included in this press release

In this management report, amounts expressed in millions of euros are
rounded to the nearest million. As a result, the sums of the rounded
amounts may differ very slightly from the reported totals. All ratios and
changes are calculated based on underlying amounts, which feature in
the consolidated financial statements.

“Organic change” measures the movement in monetary indicators
excluding the effects of changes in exchange rates and scope of
consolidation. It is defined as the difference between (i) the indicator for
the prior period, recomputed at the exchange rates applicable for the
current period to entities whose reporting currency is not the euro, less
the contribution of entities divested during the current period, and (ii) the
value of the indicator for the current period less the contribution of
entities acquired during the current period

The impact of these adjustment entries on the income statements at
31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 is shown in the tables
on pages 4 and 5, Calculation of free operating cash flow is outlined

Management report — 2017 Financial Information

Orders with @ unit value of less than €100 million grew by 1% compared
10 2016

From a geographical point of view, order intake was logically down in
emerging markets (€4,095 million, -36%), Asia having benefited in
2016 from the order related to Indian Rafale fighter aircraft and the
Middle East, of 2 large orders'"!. Order intake in mature markets
recorded growth [€10,824 million, +7%), driven especially by France
(+28%] and the United Kingdom (+15%}

At €5,200 million compared to €5,872 million in 2016, order intake
in the Aerospace segment was down 11%. Avionics, both civil and
military, was particularly robust. In-flight entertainment (IFE) maintained a
solid commercial performance, in both the fields of traditional multimedia
systems and in connectivity. Space order intake was however significantly
down, affected by the wait-and-see attitude of telecommunications
satellite operators and by a high basis of comparison in the institutional
area (observation, exploration, navigation).

Order intake in the Transport segment totalled €1,780 million, up
18% on 2016, driven by robust growth in both urban and mainline signalling

At €7,883 million, order intake in the Defence & Security segment
posted a 13% fall which can be explained by India's 2016 booking
for Rafale fighter aircraft. Excluding this “one-off” item, order intake in
this segment was up, benefiting from robust bookings across almost all
businesses.

for 2016, up 6.1% on a reported basis, and up 7.2% at constant

momentum across virtually all segments.

As expected, sales saw a marked acceleration in the fourth quarter
[+12.5% on reported basis, +14.8% in organic terms), driven by a weak
basis of comparison and by phasing effects between Q3 and G4 2017

From a geographical perspective, this good performance reflects both
continued strong growth in emerging markets, running at more than 10%
for the fourth consecutive year (+10.3%}, and increased organic growth
in mature markets (+5.8%, after +3.9% in 2016 and +0.5% in 2015}
Emerging markets accounted for 31% of Group sales, up from 30% in
2016 and 23% in 2013, the year prior to the launch of Ambition 10

Sales in the Aerospace segment came in at €5,985 million, up 3.0%
compared to 2016 (up +3.6% at constant scope and currency). The
commercial avionics business remained robust, driven in particular by
the growth in deliveries of avionic systems to Airbus. In-Flight Entertainment
was affected by a high basis of comparison and posted a slight drop
in sales as a result. Space sales experienced strong growth, lifted by
the ramp-up of contracts signed in 2014 and 2015 in both observation
and telecommunications activities. Sales in other segment businesses
fell, as the growth in the training and simulation business was insufficient
to offset the declining sales of microwave tubes, affected by the slowdown
of the global satellite market.

In the Transport segment, sales totalled €1,761 million, up 9.9%
compared to 2016 (up +11.2% at constant scope and currency). This
growth reflected the progress on the major urban signalling projects
won in 2015 and 2016 (Doha, Dubai, Hong Kong, London). The
strong rise in sales in the fourth quarter is not representative of the trend
in this business activity; it reflects a low basis of comparison and phasing
effects between quarters.

Sales in the Defence & Security segment were €7,983 million, up
8.0% compared to 2016 (up +9.4% at constant scope and currency)
Almost all businesses contributed to this momentum. The Land and Air
Systems business recorded particularly acute growth in optronics,
missile electronics, Air Traffic Management and protected vehicles, with

the ramping-up of the Hawkei vehicle supply contract for the Australian
Defence Force. The Defence Mission Systems business posted strong
growth for combat aircraft systems, driven by the 3 major Rafale contracts
in Egypt, Qatar and India. Despite favourable dynamics in cybersecurity
and military network and infrastructure systems, the Secure Information
Systems and Communication business posted a more modest growth,
especially as several major critical infrastructure protection contracts came
to an end.

As expected, sales in the Defence & Security segment recorded strong
growth in the fourth quarter (+19.4% based on reported figures,
+22.1% on an organic basis}, owing to contract phasing effects and a
favourable prior-year basis of comparison

The Aerospace segment posted EBIT of €601 million (10.0% of
sales}, versus €571 million (9.8% of sales) in 2016. The EBIT margin
rose in particular in the Space and cockpit avionics businesses, even as
the Group implemented a sharp upturn in R&D investments. Profitability
remained however under pressure within the microwave and imaging
systems activities, affected by the slowdown in the global satellite
construction market.

EBIT for the Transport segment continued to grow sharply, at €72 million
(4.1% of sales), compared to €11 million (0.7% of sales} in 2016. This
improvement is fully in line with the recovery plan that has been
implemented since mid-2015, but low or zero margin contracts continued
to weigh down on profitability. Ongoing transformation efforts and the
gradual phasing-out of low-margin contracts should help this business
regain its past profitability levels by 2018/2019.

EBIT for the Defence & Security segment was €869 million (10.9% of
sales}, compared to €787 million (10.7% of sales) in 2016. Just as in
2016, the EBIT margin for this segment improved organically by 0.3
points, driven by sales growth, good cost control and a drop in
restructuring costs.

(I) Non-GAAP measures, see definitions on pages 8 and 9.

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

Naval Group's coniribution to EBIT totalled €48 million in 2017,
compared to €34 million in 2016, buoyed by the improved operating
profitability in naval defence (which nevertheless included a few
one-time items), partially offset by the depreciation of some assets in
renewable marine energies

Naval Group’s contribution to EBIT totalled €48 million in 2017,
compared to €34 million in 2016, the improved operating profitability
being partially offset by the depreciation of some assets in renewable
marine energies.

Adjusted financial result

At €5 million in 2017 compared to €6 million in 2016, the amount of
net financial interest remained low. Other adjusted financial results
(expense) amounted to a net expense of - €29 million, compared to
i net expense of - €10 million in 2016, primarily due to a less favourable
foreign exchange performance. Adjusted finance costs on pensions
and other employee benefits remained stable |-€63 million, versus
-€66 million in 2016), with the rise in pension obligations between
January 2016 and | January 2017 offset by a decline in discount rates


--- Page 8 ---

Adjusted tax expense

Adjusted tax expense amounied to a net of -€403 million in 2017
compared to -€314 million in 2016, representing 31.0% of adjusted
net income before tax and Thales’s share in the net income of equity
affiliates. This rise in the effective tax rate can be explained by 3 one-off
non-cash items representing a negative amount of €66 million

the benefit from the cancellation by France of the 3% tax payable
on dividends, which was offset in 2017 by the one-off tax
contribution implemented by the government;

the estimated impact of the French parliament approving a gradual
reduction of corporate income tax, which will drop from 34.43% in
2018 to 25.83% in 2022; and

¢ the estimated impact of the drop in the United States federal tax
rate, which moves from 35% to 21% as of | January 2018, following
the approval of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"

Excluding these 3 one-off items, the effective tax rate would have been
26%, the same rate as in 2016.

Adjusted net income, Group share, per share"! came out at €4.64,
also up 9% on 2016 (€4.25). Without the 3 one-off tax items mentioned
above, the adjusted net income, Group share, would have come out at

1.1.1.6 Consolidated results

Income from operations

Income from operations amounted to €1,258 million versus
€1,097 million in 2016, up around 15%. This increase reflects the
improvement in gross margin and great discipline over indirect costs,
which were up just 4%. General and administrative expenses increased
by 1% from 2016 to 2017

Income from operations after share
in net income of equity-accounted companies

Income from operations after share in net income of equity-accounted
companies amounted to €1,311 million versus €1,422 million in
2016, down 8%, affected by changes to the “disposal of assets,
changes in scope of consolidation and other” line, which had benefited
in 2016 from capital gains on the disposal of shareholdings, in
Hanwha Thales and Thales-Raytheon Systems LIC. Share in net income
of equity affiliates amounted to €135 million, up 12%.

income, from a good control of operating investments (€431 million
compared to €472 million in 2016) and from a combination of items
that improved the change in working capital requirement The cash
conversion rate from adjusted net income into free operating cash flow
reached 139%.

Management report — 2017 Financial Information

The net balance of acquisitions and disposals amounted to -€80 million
lt primarily included the net cash outflow of €91 million incurred when
finalising the acquisition of Guavus, one of the pioneers in real-time
“big data” analytics, and the proceeds from the disposal of the identity
management business finalised in May 2017

At 31 December 2017, net cash totalled €2,971 million compared to
€2,366 million at 31 December 2016, after the distribution of €349 million
in dividends |€297 million in 2016)

At €5,326 million versus €4,640 million at 31 December 2016, equity,
Group share was up, driven by the consolidated net income, Group
share, a fall in net pension provisions, and a higher valuation of the currency
derivatives portfolio.

1.1.1.8 Proposed dividend

At the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2018, the Board of Directors
will propose the distribution of a dividend of €1.75 per share, an
increase of 9% on 2016.

fF approved, the ex-dividend date will be 30 May 2018 and the
payment date will be 1 June 2018. The dividend will be paid fully in
cash and will amount to € 1.30 per share, after deducting the interim
dividend of € 0.45 per share paid in December 2017

1.1.1.9 IFRS 15 implementation

In 2017, the Group continued to work on the implementation of the
IFRS 15 standard “Revenue from contracts with customers”. This standard,
the application of which has been mandatory since 1 January 2018,
provides for:

new criteria to demonstrate the continuous transfer of control of goods
fo the customer and enable the recognition of revenue over time;

© the unbundling of multiple performance obligations within a single
contract;

measurement of progress towards completion of a contract (or
performance obligation for unbundled contracts) based on costs
incurred

With regard to sales and adjusted gross margin, the differences are
primarily due to the change in the percentage-of-completion method for
long-term contracts. Currently, contract sales and margins are recognised
as and when technical milestones are reached, which attest to the
effective stage of completion of a portion of the work or the performance
of services provided for in the contract. Under IFRS 15, the percentage-
of-completion method used is the cost-to-cost method, whereby revenue
is recognised based on costs incurred at a given date divided by total
costs expected at completion. For each contract, depending on the stage
of completion and the type of milestones reached and costs incurred
during the period, this change of method may lead to the recognition of
revenue and margins being deferred from one period to another.

To a lesser degree, these differences are due to certain contracts being
unbundled into performance obligations with differentiated margins
(particularly for contracts combining construction and operation, or the
construction and launch of a satellite), which may also lead to the
deferral of the recognition of revenue and margins

Finally, the impact of the requalification of contracts no longer fulfilling
cover time recognition criteria is very limited. A detailed analysis of the
contract portfolio found that this requalification, which could have
generated very significant deferrals in the recognition of revenue and
margins if it had applied to a large number of contracts, only concerns
a small number, the total revenue of which represents less than 1% of the
order book at 31 December 2016.

2017 Financial Information — Management report

Had this standard been applicable as of Ist January 2017, these
impacts taken together would have led to a negative restatement of
€568 million on 2017 sales, and of €133 million on 2017 adjusted
gross margin, which would in turn amount to 24.4% of sales (+0.0
points). As the new standard affects neither the total revenue nor the
overall profitability of each contract, this restatement corresponds solely
to timing differences.

The impact of the standard on 2017 adjusted indirect costs would have
amounted to -€29 million, comesponding solely to the derecognition
of bid costs from costs at completion and their subsequent recognition
under indirect costs for the period

The impact on the 2017 share in net income of equity affiliates would
have been negative by €15 milion, exclusively inked to Naval Group

2 RESTATED KEY 2017 FIGURES

As a result, restated 2017 EBIT would have been €1,365 million,
€177 million lower than the EBIT reported for the same period. The fall
in EBIT margin (9.0% under IFRS 15 versus 9.8% under current
standards) corresponds primarily to the negative operating leverage
due to lower sales, with the gross margin remaining stable in
percentage, and indirect costs virtually unchanged by the standard.

These amounts reflect the impact on the aggregate sales and margin of
several thousand contracts; they are not representative of the standard’s
impact on the financial statements of future periods

After restatement, the adjusted net income, Group share would have
amounted to €840 million, €142 million lower than the reported
amount, reflecting the shifts in the timing of sales recognition resulting
from the new standard

The application of the standard would have had a similar negative
impact, €142 million, on the consolidated net income, Group share.

1.1.1.10 Update on the projected
Gemalto acquisition

On 17 December 2017, Thales and Gemalto (Euronext Amsterdam
and Paris: GTO) announced the signing of a merger agreement
including an all-cash offer for all issued and outstanding ordinary
shares of Gemalto, for a price of €51 per share cum dividend!) This
offer was unanimously recommended by Gernalto's Board of Directors.

Preparations for this offer are proceeding as planned. The draft offer
document is under review by the Dutch Financial Markets Authority
(AFM). The process of obtaining the necessary regulatory authorisations
is also underway. The transaction is expected to close shortly after all of
the usual regulatory approvals have been secured, which is expected in
the second half of 2018

All charges directly related to this transaction will be excluded from the
2018 EBIT and adjusted net income

1.1.1.11 2018 Outlook

As of | January 2018, the Group applies the IFRS 15 standard
“Revenue from contracts with customers”. To provide a basis for
understanding the 2018 financial targets, the 2017 results restated
for the application of this standard are presented on page 16.

In 2018, Thales should continue to benefit from positive trends in the
majority of its markets. The acceleration of the commercial momentum in

1.1.2 Risk factors

Thales is exposed to numerous risks and uncertainties which could
materially affect its business, reputation, financial position, results or
ability to achieve its objectives. The risks described below are not the
only ones that Thales faces. Other risks, currently unknown to Thales, or
which presently appear to be non-significant, could also have an
unfavourable impact on the business, profitability and financial position
of the Group or its ability to achieve its objectives

Generally, Thales may be faced with a number of operational and
strategic risks (Section 1.1.2.1), legal and compliance risks (Section
1.2.2) and financial risks (Section 1.1.2.3).

See also Section 1.1.3 “Internal control and risk management"

1.1.2.1 Operational and

strategic risks

1.1.2.1.1 Control of bids and projects

Many of Thales's products and systems are highly complex due to their
advanced technology content, the rigorous operational constraints and
harsh environments in which they operate (which require them to be
extremely reliable), and the contractual arrangements surrounding their
sale (comprehensive prime contractorships for large-scale systems,
public-private partnerships or their equivalent, local shares,
compensation commitments (see Section 1.1.2.1.10), etc.)

{1} Valuing the equity copital of Gemalto at approximately €4.8 billion

Management report — 2017 Financial Information

the defence businesses should offset the slowdown of the telecom
satellite market. In this context, 2018 order intake is expected to be
around €15.5 billion

In spite of a more moderate growth in the Aerospace segment, sales
should see an organic growth of between 4 and 5% compared to
2017 sales restated for the application of the IFRS 15 standard
(€15,228 million).

The Group will continue to significantly increase its R&D investments,
particularly in digital technologies. The self-funded R&D expenses
should therefore increase by around 10% compared to 2017

The growth in sales, combined with the impact of the Ambition 10
strategy on product competitiveness and differentiation, should result in
Thales delivering an EBIT of between €1,620 and €1,660 million in
2018 (based on February 2018 scope and exchange rates}, representing
an increase of 19% to 22% compared to 2017 EBIT restated for the
application of the IFRS 15 standard (€1,365 million)

Therefore, the Group expects to exceed its two mid-term objectives: the
average organic sales growth in the 2016-2018 period should be over
5%, and the 2018 EBIT margin should be above the top end of the
range set in April 2014 (9.5% to 10% in 2017/2018}

This outlook does not take into account the projected acquisition of
Gemalto. The Group may need to update its outlook depending on the
effective conclusion date of this transaction.

The Group will provide a detailed update on its strategy and set
medium-term financial targets at a Capital Markets Day to be held on
6th June 2018, at its Gennevilliers site, in the Paris area

The actual cost of development and manufacture may therefore exceed
initial cost estimates, which in turn may adversely impact Thales's results
and financial position, especially considering that the associated
contracts are generally based on a fixed, all-inclusive price. In addition,
many contracts include stringent performance levels and/or tight delivery
schedules for the products or systems sold, particularly given the strong
competition. If Thales is unable to deliver these products or systems in
line with the requited level of performance and/or delivery schedule,
customers may demand penalty payments or even decide to terminate
the contract.

Bid and project management is therefore subject to a detailed risk
assessment and management process. Thales ranks the various levels of
criticality. Critical bids and projects are specifically monitored at the
management level of the operating entities (Business Lines and Global
Business Units] and, as needed, by Group management.

Contractual risk assessment is an integral part of the tendering process.
Depending on the complexity of the bid, this procedure involves a
number of steps which progressively sharpen the estimated level of
profitability and the associated risks to be assessed

Numerous Thales contracts, particularly those that involve the most
complex products and services, run for several years. Their economic
contribution to the Group's result over a given period is therefore
assessed, in accordance with applicable accounting standards, based
on an estimate of their cost to completion

These assessments can result in uncertainties that require subsequent
correction despite the careful attention that is paid to estimates for each
project through regular reviews to measure the technical, contractual and
financial progress made

2017 Financial Information — Management report

The Group pays special attention to analyses and action plans for
efficiently managing bids and projects by measuring and monitoring
financial variance on the projects as well as appropriately applying
corrective actions

As part of the Ambition Boost performance programme (see also
Section 1.1.2.1.8 "Risk of lower impact of performance improvement
measures"), the Group has also implemented action plans to improve
the management of bids and projects, engineering and the supply chain
These actions aim in particular to

¢ improve product policy and ensure it is better adapted to customer
needs in order to streamline new developments and thus reduce risks;

¢ improve the management of commitments in both the bidding phase
and the project phase, with the widespread use of independent
peer reviews, closer involvement of Engineering, Purchasing,
Production, Legal and Quality Control, and the introduction of
Product and Project Design Authorities responsible for developing
the technical solutions for products and projects (during the bid or
project implementation phase];

«Improve the supply chain, by increasing its global dimension and
enhance the increasing maturity of emerging countries in project
implementation;

¢ improve methods, practices and tools to make them more relevant to
international products/projects, in particular, through the implementation
of a project management tool adapted to emerging countries, SAP
by Design;

¢ introduce advanced training for project managers to obtain
certification issued jointly with the International Project Management
Association (IPMA). At the end of 2017, nearly 1,353 bid and
project managers and project management officers (PMO) within
the Group had gained IPMA certification, with approximately
187 certified during the year. The role of these project managers will
be further increased within the PMO organizations and teams.

1.1.2.1.2 Supplier risk

Purchases constitute a very significant proportion of Thales's business,
representing nearly half its sales with purchases ranging from industrials
fo services, equipment and sub-systems. Thales is therefore exposed to
the risk of the industrial, technical or financial default of any of its
suppliers, which could affect tits performance and, hence, profitability

There are two major types of supplier risk:

e legal or regulatory non-compliance (ethics, export control,
intellectual property, etc.); each of these risks is handled by the
departments concerned using the Group Risk Management system
with the support of the Purchasing department;

structural and operational risks that could disrupt supply, which are
dealt with in the Purchasing department using the Group Risk
Management system. The Purchasing department has identified two
key triggers: supplier default and economic dependence

Risk of supplier default

Supplier default could be caused by a major incident at one of its sites,
by its external environment (shortage of raw materials or components,
major political instability, natural disasters, etc.) or through
mismanagement. The supplier's management performance is monitored
both in operating terms (poor procurement planning, failure to manage
tier 2 suppliers, loss of control over industrial processes, plant
obsolescence, etc.) and in cross-disciplinary and financial terms [poor
skills management, loss of know-how, fall in sales, mismanagement of
working capital requirement, cash flow problems, administration or
bankruptcy protection, etc.). A combination of problems could lead to

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

the disappearance of a company or its takeover by investors with
different interests from those of Thales.

Faced with this risk of a supply shortage, Thales implements a dual
sourcing or alternative-source} policy as frequently as possible for each
technology family, regularly updated and accompanied by buffer
inventories that cover its requirements until customer contracts have been

fulfilled

In addition, given the increased risk of fragility of certain suppliers in the
current economic climate, Thales has introduced a special approach
Based on close cooperation between buyers and financial teams, this is
aimed at identifying, from among its critical suppliers, those that would
be particularly susceptible financially and implementing appropriate
action plans to ensure continuity of supply. Apart from individual
monitoring, an analysis is also carried out by technology field in
conjunction with the professional bodies concerned, to identify the most
appropriate solutions.

Alongside these financial supervision measures, Purchasing and Quality
Control have stepped up their appraisal, accreditation and
management of supplier performance to better identify structural risks.
Supplier performance audits are broad-based (covering quality control,
industrial maturity, flow optimisation, compliance with environmental
regulations, expertise in technical and technological processes,
financial strength, etc.) and therefore allow a complete risk analysis to
be carried out. When performing a purchasing contract, Thales closely
monitors the implementation by the supplier of measures aimed at
addressing the risks identified during the selection process

Risk of economic dependence

The economic dependence of small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) towards Thales is considered a risk in its own right.

In order to mitigate this risk, the commitment rate (orders placed by
Thales as a percentage of the supplier's annual sales) is measured for
each panel of suppliers by market segment [vertical approach) and for
the main countries where the Group is established (France, the UK, the
Netherlands, etc.)

If the commitment rate exceeds 50% for more than two consecutive
years, an action plan coordinated with internal specifiers and internal
users is created in order to return to a commitment rate of 25%

The purchasing policy, supplier selection and performance monitoring
processes, and the supplier monitoring systems are designed to reduce
these risks, during both the bidding phase and the project
implementation phase.

1.1.2.1.3 Human resources risk

a) Workplace health and safety

One of the Group's key priorities is to provide a safe and healthy work
environment for all employees, in compliance with applicable law, by
monitoring procedures, preventing health and occupational risks and
training employees.

These principles are reflected in a structure designed to prevent risks related
to health and safety in the workplace, whether on Thales sites or external
sites, and to manage major health crises that could occur internationally.

Regular monitoring of the risks to which the Group's employees may be
exposed is performed each year

Tangible measures are also implemented in relation to the prevention of
risks related to the health and safety of employees in the workplace by
the Group's Human Resources and Health, Safety and Environment
Departments. For many years, Thales has also been committed to
improving the quality of life in the workplace. In France, a third Group


--- Page 12 ---

agreement on “quality of life in the workplace" is under negotiation to
increase the Group's commitments and actions relating specifically to
protecting the health of employees, improving well-being at work,
preventing psychosocial risk situations and the right to disconnect to
ensure a good worklife balance.

Proof of the Group's continuing commitment to certification, 107 Thales
entities (representing 82% of the workforce) had obtained OHSAS
18001 certification by the end of 2017

b) Talent development

If Thales is not attractive enough compared to its competitors to recruit
the qualified staff it needs in a timely manner and fo retain and motivate its
employees, sales and operating profitability could be negatively affected

Thales’ success and performance effectively depend on:

its capacity to recruit employees in the different employment markets,
in France and abroad;

the quality of the key skills and the commitment of its employees; and

its capacity to globally manage the talent required for the development
of its activity worldwide.

Thales therefore attaches great importance to its attractiveness and
positioning as a top employer, ensuring a positive external image which
will boost recruitment and an internal work environment that will contribute
to retaining employees.

As an attractive and recognised employer in France, Thales is also
building up its image in all the countries where the Group is already
present and in the countries in which Thales plans to expand, notably
through communication campaigns and partnerships with leading
universities. In addition, a global recruitment role, reporting to the
corporate HR department has been created to help the Group expand
in these geographical zones

Thales works constantly to support its employer brand. The Group
recently updated its brochures, booths, posters, web visuals and all
other communication materials used at the various recruitment events
worldwide and on Thales’ social media pages. The Group currently
has more than 230,000 followers on LinkedIn

Thales has also developed innovative initiatives to attract rare skills in
fields such as in electronics and cyber-security, by organising
challenges for students and young engineers such as cyber-security
week and the Arduino project, a university competition held in 10
countries. This project gives more than 100 teams of young engineers
the opportunity to develop innovative projects on subjects defined by
the Group. These events give young engineers from across the world
an insight into the Group and its business activities.

In recent years, Thales has also contributed to the integration of young
people into business through the signature of close to 1,500 work-study
contracts each year. Thales maintains active relations with schools and
universities in all the countries where it intends to increase its presence.
Many partnerships have been signed with these schools, which
employees sometimes visit to provide training. Thales also has a
presence on campuses through young employees who are alumni of
these schools, and form a network of contacts. In France, Thales is
regularly recognised as one of the top three companies by students of
engineering schools.

The global process of identifying and developing talent within the
Group has also been reinforced by encouraging interaction between
management teams in different parts of the organisation.

Thales is also continuing its proactive skills management policy for the
Group's main professional families. A Steering Committee per family,
composed of operational and HR managers, conducts a yearly analysis

Management report — 2017 Financial Information

of changes in jobs, expertise, and the needs of the Company, and
creates action plans (for training, anticipated management of internal
mobility, external recruitment, etc.). To complement this tool, each year
the Group's internal university updates key training programmes in
response to changing needs. Significant work was carried out from
2014 to 2016 to pinpoint employee soft skills, namely for those
employees reporting to the R&D Systems, R&D Hardware, R&D
Sofware, Purchasing and Project Management job families. This work
helps to more precisely identify training and recruitment requirements. In
July 2017, Thales University, renamed learning Hub, was completely
overhauled to adapt its training tools to the digital era and to better
integrate the training into employees’ professional life.

Lastly, in 2013, the Group signed a series of agreements with the
unanimous support of the trade union organisations in France that
encourage the integration of young people, either on work-study
training schemes or post-qualification, and the transfer of knowledge
(the Intergenerational Agreement); that develop diversity |the Gender
Equality Agreement); and that take a forward-looking approach to jobs
and skills. In 2017, the number of young people on work-study
contracts in Thales’s workforce in France represented close to 5%, in
line with the agreement signed in 2013

1.1.2.1.4 Environmental risks

For many years, Thales has conducted a regular analysis and update of
environmental risks in accordance with its business activities, scientific
and technical developments as well as with current regulatory change.

This analysis is aimed a

© regularly ensuring that employees and neighbouring residents are
not exposed to health and environmental risks [hazardous substances,
pollution, asbestos, etc.) through their activities or work environment,
whether on Thales or external sites;

e ensuring the compliance of activities and products used and/or
marketed (substances, waste, etc.);

© analysing the impact of new regulations (e.g. REACh in Europe) on
the supply chain and on product design;

analysing the impact of the environment on activities {water stress,
climatic events, etc.);

identifying an appropriate organisational structure and associated
action plans, either at Group level or locally, based on the results of
this analysis to reduce and manage the associated risks.

To support this analysis, an environmental management system
designed to ensure control and limitation of the environmental impacts
of activities and products is implemented on all sites. This management
system, which forms an integral part of the Group's framework,
encompasses the different functions of the Group (engineering,
manufacturing, supply chain, etc.) and is based on frameworks, special
training, communication tools and sharing experience.

At the end of 2017, 124 entities had been ISO 14001 certified,
representing 89% of the Group's workforce, 33 had been ISO 50001
cetlified, representing 26% of the Group's workforce and 107 had
been OHSAS 18001 certified, representing 82% of the Group's
workforce

Thalles also regularly assesses the risks linked to climate change in order to
evaluate their impact on activity and costs. The main risks identified are:

regulatory change (reporting, carbon taxes, etc.) which has a very
limited impact for Thales (not affected by the EU Emissions Trading
Scheme]. Nevertheless, Thales closely monitors current and future
laws and regulations in order to analyse and anticipate their impact
and set in place the requisite measures;

2017 Registration Document — THALES

information — Management report

¢ changes in the regulations on substances and products (REACh in
Europe and elsewhere in the world) in order to anticipate obsolescence
issues fo secure its supplies, reduce and control the impacts on the
products and services it delivers through the required avoidance
and replacement measures; but also to control the risks related to the
handling of hazardous substances, for both people and the natural
environment,

e financial risks related to the effects of climate change (floods,
hurricanes, fires, water stress, etc.) that can result in damages and a
continuous disruption in activity at Thales sites as well as the sites of
its subcontractors and partners.

To manage this risk and reduce its vulnerability, Thales has carried
out regular assessments of the exposure of its different sites to natural
disasters and their consequences for several years now. Action plans
linked to these assessments have been defined in order to attenuate
this risk (see Section 5.2.4), and the Group's insurance policy [see
Section 1.1.2.4 “Insurance is also based on these assessments;

¢ tisks related to water shortages. The majority of Group sites in vulnerable
areas are offices that have very limited risk exposure given their low
water consumption

An analysis of “natural disaster” and “water stress” risks is now
included in the regular prevention visits at Thales’ sites and those of
our critical subcontractors and suppliers;

@ image risk: any failure by Thales to implement adequate measures
in the fight against climate change could have a specific negative
impact on its corporate image. Thales publishes information on the
measures it has put in place to combat climate change and the
results it obtains (see also Section 5.2.4) for its stakeholders
(customers, investors, civil society, etc.). In 2017, it was awarded a
rating of A- for “climate change” in the CDP (Carbon Disclosure
Project}, placing it in the top 20% of best-performing companies listed
In keeping with the commitments made in 2015, in December 2017
Thales signed the Paris “French Business Pledge’

At 31 December 2017, provisions for environmental risks amounted
to €5.7 million

1.1.2.1.5 Security breaches in respect of sites
and employees

Thales is exposed to attempts to breach the security of its sites: attempts
by unauthorised persons to access confidential information,
cyber-attacks, threats to the physical security of facilities and persons,
etc. The occurrence of such events could affect the Group's intellectual,
economic or human capital, the rollout of the Group's activities and its
reputation and, consequently, its results and financial position

In order to minimise these risk, the Group Security department has put in
place a policy for regulating access to and movement around alll sites.
This policy, applied by the Group’ network of security officers, is in
keeping with the Group's defence businesses and the different national
regulations requiring it to implement measures to protect its employees
and industrial assets. The Group is therefore required to undergo a large
number of audits and inspections by the national supervisory authorities.

It has also implemented a global procedure for employee safety and
protection in all of the countries in which they perform their work. In certain
countries, this global procedure runs alongside a local intervention
system, which ensures a quick response to incidents

Faced with the current heightened terrorist threat, the Group has
increased the level of security and protection for its most sensitive sites.

Finally, in close collaboration with the other major functions concerned,
the Group Security department is working to improve crisis
management processes, put in place rules and define a policy to raise
awareness on information protection

1.1.2.1.6 Risk of IT system failure

The Group operates — whether directly or through service providers —
complex IT systems and infrastructures that are essential to the smooth
running of its commercial, industrial and financial processes. These
information systems include management, development and engineering
systems as well as platforms operated on behalf of our customers and
must be protected against any malfunctions, natural disasters, malicious
acts or human error at all costs. The malfunction or failure of these
systems may have external causes (viruses or hacking, network failures,
natural disasters, etc.) or internal causes (malicious acts, breaches of
data confidentiality, human error or obsolescence). Any such
malfunction or failure can have an impact on the Group's operations
and its financial results.

To guard against these risks, the Group has implemented multi-year
plans to develop its protection measures in order to deal with part of its
IT systems being ternporarily or permanently unavailable, as well as any
cyber-security threats to these systems.

Business continuity

A Disaster Recovery Plan is adapted to the different countries to deal
with failures of part of Thales's IT systems; a methodology to prevent the
tisk of a failure of the Group's IT systems is applied to ensure disaster
recovery solutions are adapted to the degree of the risk and its
operational impact. The plan is based on an analysis of the criticality of
the different services given their impact on the Group's operations and
undergoes regular test runs.

Cybersecurity

A plan to protect against risks related to cyber-security has been defined
and implemented in countries where the Group currently operates
As well as adapting the means of protection already in place, the plan
includes the introduction of new measures to heighten protection against
cyber sabotage attacks (e.g. Wannacry] to identify and correct any
non-compliance. It is adapted to new regulations (military programming
law in France, general regulations on data protection) and to technological
developments (e.g. cloud computing}.

This plan also includes the implementation of “CyberSecurity Operation
Centres" coordinated at global level, so that anomalies and incidents
that could affect the security of systems are identified as early as
possible and the appropriate solutions put in place. These measures for
monitoring and sharing information in relation to vectors of attack were
further developed throughout 2017.

A number of “Key rules” on the security of Thales's information systems
ensure the convergence and coherence of cyber-security and defence
measures throughout the Group. Their effective application is regularly
monitored and reporting submitted to the Group Information Systems
Security department.

Awareness and know-how

The plan is completed by ongoing efforts to raise employee awareness
of these threats: communication campaigns and training are rolled out
to help users ensure the security of their IT systems and remind them of
the best practices when using them. Regular forums for discussion
attended by all employees are also held on site. Since 2017 new
employees have also been made aware of cyber security issues

(I) French Business Pledge: on the eve of the One Planet Summit on 12 December 2017, 91 French companies of all sizes and from all sectors announced the signature of a shared commitment to climate.
Each of these companies put forward ils actions as a committed player in the fight against global warning

1.1.2.1.7 Risk related to failure of equipment
or technology

Thales systems and equipment are highly complex and technical and
are likely to be integrated within high-value commercial or military
platforms. A malfunction of any such systems, equipment or technologies
could result in client claims or third-party litigation. Thales could
therefore be held liable, notably in the event of damage to property or
personal injury, or in the event that they result in a disruption in the
business and activities of its customers. Were they to occur, such events
would be liable to impact Thales's results and financial position, as well
s its reputation

In order to limit the impact, Thales has put Group-wide standards
in place (Design Authority, quality, documentation, contractual
arrangements and risk management). In addition, Thales follows a
policy of maintaining appropriate insurance coverage (see Section
1.1.2.4 Insurance’).

1.1.2.1.8 Risk of lower impact of performance
improvement measures

In 2014, to support its medium-term financial targets, Thales launched
the “Ambition Boost" performance plan to increase the entire Group's
performance

This global performance plan provides a common framework within
which the units can implement plans and initiatives adapted to their
own issues in terms of performance improvements. Five new
cross-disciplinary initiatives are also now in place to complete and
strengthen the performance plans: Going Global, Digital Transformation,
Competitiveness, Diversity & Inclusion and Leadership & Governance.

The earings and financial position of Thales could be negatively
impacted if the initiatives planned under the Ambition Boost framework
could not be fully implemented or if they failed to generate the expected
results according to the original timetable. Moreover, the cost of
implementing these initiatives could end up being higher than expected

Thales has introduced specific monitoring for performance improvernent
initiatives and the Group's corporate management regularly reviews the
progress of the main initiatives.

1.1.2.1.9 Competitive environment

Thales operates in highly competitive markets, both in terms of
international groups and in terms of local or niche companies in certain
market segments. This competitive pressure could negatively impact
Thales’ commercial position, sales and profits

lt could also intensify in a less favourable economic environment and
there is no guarantee that Thales will be able to position itself
successfully against its current or future competitors.

In order to limit the impact of this risk, Thales continues its research and
development investments in order to provide more competitive and
differentiating elements, and it also works to structure and upgrade its
product offer in order to always best meet the needs of its customers in
both the defence and commercial markets

The Group's success and performance in relation to its competitors also
depends on its capacity to recruit and retain quality employees with the
requisite skills and commitment. Thales therefore attaches great
importance to its attractiveness and positioning as a top employer,
ensuring a positive external image which will boost recruitment and an
internal work environment that will help retain employees (see Section
1.1.2.1.3-b) “Talent development’)

Management report — 2017 Financial Information

1.1.2.1.10 Offsets

In some countries, the awarding of major contracts, particularly defence
contracts, may be dependent on a legal or regulatory requirement to
fulfil a direct, semi-direct or indirect offset requirement. The Group's
ability to factor this into a proposal can be a major source of differentiation
and, as such, have a decisive impact on its commercial success or failure.

The non-fulfilment of contractual offset obligations within the requisite
deadlines can result in penalties, the payment of which does not
always release the obligor from its obligations. It can also compromise
the Group's capacity to expand its activities in a given country.

Thales's order intake in recent years (particularly the order for the Rafale
fighter aircraft placed by the Indian authorities in the third quarter of
2016) has led to a substantial increase in its offset obligations

Faced with these risks, Thales has set in place a dedicated structure,
both at a central level and for its exporting units and destination
countries, which is responsible for integrating and overseeing these
abligations as early as the bid phase. The Group also has a specific
unit that is entirely devoted to the management of indirect offsets, Thales
International Offsets (TIO).

1.1.2.1.11 Market trends

The markets on which Thales operates are broadly correlated to the
current economic backdrop, but can also be impacted by specific
factors: technological breakthroughs, the impact of digitalisation, drastic
changes in Business Models, deregulation, new standards, real or
perceived increase in the threat of terrorism, changes in oil prices,
conflicts or major political change, epidemics and disasters that could
have an impact, however temporary, on these markets. This is particularly
true of the civil aviation market.

As part of the development of its activities related to in-flight broadband,
Thales entered into a strategic agreement with SES in 2016 to secure
bandwidth over the Americas. Under this agreement, Thales committed
fo. an annual bandwidth purchasing programme over the 2016 to 2028
period and the payment to SES of a set minimum fee. The profitability of
this business could therefore be affected if the sale of the broadband
services was lower than forecast for several consecutive years

The main tisk mitigation factors are Thales’ efforts to bolster and promote
the offer to airlines and the flexibility built into the agreement.

In the space sector, the telecommunications satellite market is affected
by constant technological developments resulting in a decrease in the
Megabyte transmission cost. Some operators face complex
technological challenges which force them to postpone their investments.
In particular, uncertainties remain in the articulation between new
constellation models and the more traditional satellites in high orbit
which are becoming increasingly technologically advanced, allowing
for the development of higher capacity solutions. Thales is developing
its offer and investing in breakthrough technologies to embrace these
developments.

More generally, to limit the impact of market risk, Thales constantly
seeks (i) to adapt its product lines to foreseeable changes in demand
and to improve their competitive performance and industrial flexibility in
line with fluctuations in activity, and (ii) a comprehensive strategy to
balance its business portfolio,

information — Management report

1.1.2.1.12 Dependence on public procurement

Thales generates a significant share of its business from governments,
particularly in the defence markets in many countries. In these markets,
public spending is dependent on political and economic factors and is
therefore likely to fluctuate from one year to the next. A reduction in the
budget resources of government customers could, for example,
generate delays in order booking, contract execution and payments, or
mean a cut in funding for research and development programmes.

Thales has based its strategy on a balanced portfolio of defence
operations and civil operations, each accounting for approximately
50% of sales. The overall solidity of the portfolio is underpinned by a
diversified order base with a unit value of less than €100 million
Finally, the broad geographic spread of Thales's business, particularly
through its international operations, ensures further diversification of its
customer base.

1.1.2.1.13 Political risks

A significant proportion of Thales‘s sales is subject to the risk of
economic and/or political instability in the countries in which the Group
operates. The materialisation of these risks may affect the Group's
financial position and profitability.

In particular, a change in government, major political event, armed
conflict, act of terrorism, sharp deterioration in the balance of payments,
industrial action, strike or protest could lead to various types of risks.
These include:

e more restrictive currency control, with limitations or exclusions on
withdrawing currency from a customer country, preventing it from
honouring its financial commitments to Thales;

impairment of assets because of devaluations of the local currency
or other measures taken by public authorities that significantly affect
the value of operations;

¢ expropriation (by confiscation, nationalisation, requisition, etc.) or
the forced sale of Thales’ interest in a local company, of, more
broadly, discriminatory measures that compromise Thales's operations
in a country;

e a security situation entailing a risk of bodily harm for its employees
and/or security breaches at its facilities, which severely limit or
prevent Thales from assuming its performance obligations under a
contract, or reduce or prohibit the use of its local industrial assets;

¢ an unexpected breach of a contract or commitment;
© an unfair call of a bond or a guarantee;

the non-certification of documents eligible for payment, or non-payment
on the due dates stipulated in a contract, that prevent the
anticipated progress of that contract.

To limit the financial impact of the risks listed above, Thales has put in
place a methodology to identify and analyse the risks, determine
measures to reduce them and define roles and responsibilities, within
Thales, for the teams involved in the financial engineering of contracts.
This enables Thales to use public or private insurers to cover the risk of
contract interruption, credit risk or the risk of unfair calling of sureties.
It can also make use of financial instruments such as notified or
confirmed letters of credit, receivables discounting without recourse or
export credit facilities.

In June 2016, by referendum, the United Kingdom, which represents
approximately 9% of Group sales and 6,400 employees, voted to
leave the European Union. This decision could have a number of

(1) See the list of companies accounted for under the equily method on pages 79 and 80

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

consequences on the activities and financial performance of Thales. It
could notably lead to a higher degree of volatility between the pound
sterling and the euro, in interest rates and in the value of plan assets
covering the Group's pension commitments in the United Kingdom. The
management of these financial risks is part of the procedures set in
place by the Group and described in Section 1.1.2.3 "Financial risks”
The risk of an increase in tariff barriers is automatically reduced by
Thales's predominant use of local country production resources a
strategy which also tends to reduce the effects of greater volatility in the
pound since sales and production costs are essentially denominated in
the same currency.

1.1.2.1.14 Risks relating to strategic
acquisitions and investments

Thales regularly looks to acquire new companies [as well as making
strategic investments and combining business activities through joint
ventures, etc.) in order to round out its technological portfolio and
strengthen its presence in certain markets. Integrating these businesses
into Thales could prove more difficult and take longer than envisaged,
requiring more significant involvement by senior managers and the
teams concerned and, in turn, negatively impacting the Group's results
and financial position

In addition, there are no guarantees that the newly acquired companies
will perform as well as expected in accordance with the assumptions
which form the basis of their valuation and the investment decision
Significant variance could lead to the amortisation of goodwill and
other intangible assets, thereby negatively impacting Thales’s results
and financial position

In addition, the integration of a newly acquired company into the
Group may prove difficult or fail to generate all the expected synergies
and other benefits. Such events could have a negative impact on the
Group's results.

The significance of these risks and their impact varies depending on the
target company’s size.

Before any planned acquisitions, Thales conducts audits and due
diligence with the assistance of external consultants where necessary, in
order to analyse the fundamentals of the target company. This due
diligence is more limited when the target company is listed, due to the
applicable regulations.

A review is also conducted at each key stage in the acquisition process
to confirm Thales’s interest and set the necessary conditions and
parameters to ensure a successful outcome. The newly acquired
company is then integrated into Thales's financial reporting system so
that its performance can be monitored

An internal audit is carried out for all major acquisitions within 18 months
of the finalisation of the acquisition. These audits assess the strength of
the business plans that led to the decision, the integration of the newly
acquired company into the Group, the implementation of synergies and
the level of performance in relation to the assumptions made. The audit
reports are sent to the Group's corporate management and are summarised
for the Audit and Accounts Committee.

1.1.2.1.15 Risks related to minority investments

Thales generates part of its sales from companies in which control is
shared with, or exercised by, other partners; in accordance with the
accounting principles in force on | January 2017, these companies are
consolidated using the equity method"


--- Page 16 ---

By definition, the share in net income of equity-accounted companies is
included in Thales’s EBIT" and adjusted net income". A deterioration in
the performance of these companies may therefore impact on the
Group's income, financial position and achievement of EBIT objectives.

Since Thales's influence over these minority investments varies, decisions
that are detrimental to the interests of Thales may be taken, without
Thales necessarily having the means to oppose them

In addition, the risk of disagreement or deadlock, inherent in any
jointly-controlled entity, exists, particularly in those where important
decisions require the unanimity of members or where there are limited
exit rights.

Lastly, the application of management rules and principles in these
entities may differ from those adopted by Thales for entities over which
it exerts exclusive control. This also means that the ability to carry out
analyses and give instructions regarding financial or operational data,
‘or even to access this data, may be more limited than in the entities
over which Thales exerts exclusive control

As a result, the Group aims to define appropriate governance methods
by seeking to be represented on the Board of Directors (or a similar
decision-making body], and more generally, to negotiate contractual
provisions that are in Thales's best interests.

1.1.2.2 Legal and compliance risks

1.1.2.2.1 Compliance with laws and regulations

The Group operates its business, both nationally and internationally,
in a strict and evolving complex legal and regulatory environment
This environment encompasses various fields such as company law,
stock exchange law, tax law, employment law, intellectual property,
personal data protection, export control, economic sanction measures,
anti-comuption, influence peddling and money laundering

Despite the steps taken by Thales in the form of organisation and
intemal procedures to comply with all applicable legislation, risks sill
exist due to their inherent nature, the interpretative powers of regulatory
agents, the extraterritorial REACh of certain regulations, and changes in
legal/judicial precedent and sanctioning powers

In most cases, regulators in conjunction with the judicial authorities have
the right to initiate legal proceedings, which could expose the Group or
its employees to civil, administrative or criminal rulings. Such rulings could,
if applicable, involve a temporary ban on trading, which would in turn
have an adverse impact on the Group's profitability and financial position.

Using a risk map approved by the Risk Management Committee,
the Audit, Risks & Internal Control Department carries out assessments
and audits of the implementation and improvement of compliance plans
within the Group's units. Compliance measures rely for these needs on
networks of compliance officers who may be specialists (in Trade
Compliance, international trade, etc.) and on risk advisors responsible
for the prevention of each of the major risks identified and monitored by
the Risk Assessment Committee.

The Audit, Risks & Internal Control Department takes into account these
compliance areas when preparing its audit plan

{I Non-GAAP measures, see definition and computation in Section 1.1.1.2.

Management report — 2017 Financial Information

a) Business ethics

Thales's business encompasses a variety of sectors in more than 50 countries.
Infringement of applicable laws and regulations may have severe legal
and financial consequences and seriously harm the Group's reputation

An integrity programme linked to corruption risk prevention has been
in place in all Group entities for more than 15 years. It is based on a
Code of Ethics for all Group employees that is regularly updated in line
with external and internal reference systems and is posted on the Group
intranet. With a preface by the Chairman and CEO, it reaffirms in
particular the principle of zero tolerance for any act of corruption.
Thales's integrity programme was certified by independent third parties
Mazars and ADIT in 2014.

In 2017, the Group reviewed its integrity programme to bring it in line
with French Law 2016-1691 of 9 December 2016 on transparency, the
fight against corruption and the modernisation of the economy {known
as the “Sapin Il Law")

The various components of the integrity programme form an integral
part of Thales's reference system (Chorus 2.0), particularly the processes
which govern the management of bids and projects, purchases and
subcontracting, and the use of agents and consultants. In addition to
its internal control procedures, the Audit, Risks & Internal Control
Department conducts regular compliance and integrity audits on the
various components of the model

The anti-corruption policy is outlined in Section 5.3.2.1 “Anti-corruption"

b) Export control and economic sanctions

The export of many products, technologies and systems for military and
dual use by Thales is subject to obtaining licences issued by the French
and foreign authorities in advance.

In addition, the French, European and foreign regulations including the
extraterritorial regulation issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC), establish a framework of embargoes and economic and
criminal sanctions on any natural person or legal entity, or any state in
breach of these provisions

There are no guarantees that (i) the export controls to which Thales is
subject will not be tightened; (ii) new-generation products or systems
developed by Thales will not be subject fo similar or tighter controls; (iii)
geopolitical factors will not make it impossible for Thales or its suppliers
to obtain export licences for certain customers or make it more difficult
for Thales to execute previously signed contracts or will not give rise to
economic sanctions (embargoes) which could prevent Thales from
conducting or continuing to conduct business with certain countries or
certain customers. Further limitations on access to certain international
military markets could thus have a negative impact on Thales's business,
financial position and profitability.

The Group has put in place an ISO 9100 certification process to ensure
compliance with the regulations and controls applicable in terms of
export and the economic sanctions in force. This process includes
procedures, specific IT tools, employee awareness programmes, with,
in pariicular, e-learning modules, an annual internal audit plan and a
system to monitor changes in the legislation, regulations and restrictions
following economic sanctions relevant to Thales’s business activities.

Operating units have access to a network of specialists within the
Group, who are responsible for monitoring the correct application
of compliance rules decided at Group level as well as tracking
requests for the required authorisations and the conformity of their
implementation.

c) Competition law

Thales’s business activities are subject to a wide range of national and
international regulations mainly aimed at combating anti-competitive
practices, concerning suppliers, customers, pariners and the competitors
themselves.

Infringement of these rules could lead to severe sanctions, such as fines,
payment of damages and interest, and statutory prohibitions and
criminal penalties. Such sanctions could also have a serious impact on
the Group's reputation

To prevent these risks, a dedicated team of experts carries out
competitive assessment on sensitive agreements and projects, notifying
the competent regulatory authorities in Europe or abroad as required. In
addition, the Group has initiated a programme to raise awareness of
these rules, in particular through the drafting of directives, the
implementation of online training tools and dedicated training
programmes for the most exposed employees.

d) Intellectual property

Thales is exposed to two main types of intellectual property risk:
dependence on third-party technology and the infringement of intellectual
property rights.

To reduce the risk of reliance on critical third-party technology, Thales
has implemented a process to identify and manage each situation with
a precise, strategic "Make/Team/Buy” (MTB) plan

Given the nature of its activities and the specific features of its products,
Thales conducts most of its research and development work in-house
and focuses on controlling the key technology which is critical to the
business. The size of Thales's internal intellectual property portfolio (over
16,500 patents, as well as software and know-how} and its presence
throughout the value chain (equipment, systems and systems of systems)
reduce its reliance on third-party technology. As a result, Thales’s
dependence on such technology can be considered low.

To reduce the risk of third-party actions for alleged infringement of their
intellectual property rights by Thales entities, the Group identifies and
analyses this risk in the context of its own patent filing procedures
and/or when embarking on technical research or product development.

In the event of a third-party infringement claim against a Thales
company, the legal and technical analysis of the allegedly infringing
products and intellectual property rights are handled centrally by Thales
experts, with the assistance of specialist external consultants where

needed

Thales may be exposed to the risk of infringement of its intellectual
property rights by a third party. To limit this risk, Thales contractually
protects its rights in its contracts and agreements, engages in an active
policy for filing and maintaining its patents, carries out technological
monitoring on the equipment and systems sold by third parties to ensure
that its own intellectual property rights are not infringed and, where
applicable, takes all necessary measures to ensure these rights are
respected,

e) Personal data protection

In the context of the application, effective 25 May 2018, of Regulation
2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data,
Thales has committed to bringing its policies into line with this European
regulation

A Data Protection Officer has been appointed to coordinate
compliance with this new European regulation within the Thales group.
The Data Protection Officer relies on a network of contacts in the
different functions and entities both in France and the other countries
where the group operates.

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

Initiatives are already under way within the Group to launch this
compliance process, including insertion into contractual clauses on
personal data protection, the drafting of factsheets, the acquisition of a
tool to record Thales’s processing of personal data

1.1.2.2.2 Litigation

Due to the nature of its business, Thales is exposed to the risk of
technical and commercial disputes.

To prevent disputes or limit their impact, Thales’s policy is to
systematically seek alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This
policy is reviewed on a regular basis to take into account changes in
the Group's core areas of business and is backed by employee training
programmes.

In addition, for several years now Thales has implemented a procedure
to centralise all civil, commercial and criminal litigation and claims.
These are handled by the Corporate legal Affairs department, with the
support of the Group companies concerned,

In October 2017, Thales was notified of an arbitration award in a
commercial dispute between the Republic of China and a group of
three French manufacturers, including Thales Systémes Aéroporiés, a
Thales subsidiary. As a result of this arbitration award, which pertains to
a contract signed in 1992, the manufacturers were ordered to pay a
total sum of €227 million including interest, of which €64.2 million
was payable by Thales Sysi&mes Aéroportés. The corresponding
charge was recognised under “Disposal of assets, changes in scope of
consolidation and other" in the financial statements as at
31 December 2017 (see Note 3.2 of the consolidated financial
statements}

There are no other government, judicial or arbitration claims, of which
the Group is aware, which are pending or threatened, which had, in
the course of the last 12 months, or which could have a material impact
on the financial position or the profitability of the Company and/or
the Group.

1.1.2.3 Financial risks

1.1.2.3.1 Liquidity

The Group's liquidity risk is the risk of it being unable to meet its cash
needs out of its financial resources. In particular, it relates to Thales’s
level of exposure to changes in the main market indicators that could
lead to an increase in the cost of credit or even to a temporary
limitation of access to external sources of financing,

The Group manages this risk by trying to anticipate its cash needs and
ensures that these are covered by the Group's short-term and long-term
financial resources, as follows

e shareholders’ equity, listed by caption in Note 8 to the consolidated
financial statements;

© gross debt, listed by maturity in Note 6 to the consolidated financial
statements;

committed, undrawn bank credit facilities used as backup to the
commercial paper progranme and as a financial reserve. These
are described in more detail in Note 6 to the consolidated financial
statements. At 31 December 2017, the Group also had an undrawn
bridge loan to finance its proposed offer for the acquisition of
Gemalto.

The principle of centralising the entities’ short-term assets and liabilities
(cash pooling) is applied to the combination of entities in the same
currency zone (eurozone, sterling zone, dollar zone and Australian
dollar zone, etc.) and, in some cases, in the same country.


--- Page 18 ---

By consolidating and centralising the cash requirements and surpluses
of its units, the Group is in a position to:

simplify cash management and match the cash positions of units to
produce a single consolidated position that is easier to manage;

e gain prime access to financial markets through the parent
company’s financing programmes, rated by S&P Global Ratings
and Moody's (see below)

At 31 December 2017, cash recorded under consolidated assets amounted fo
€4,282.7 million (compared with €3,616.9 million at end-2016), including

© €3,450.5 million held by the parent company and available for
immediate use (€3,183.1 million in 2016);

¢ =€832.2 million in the credit balances of subsidiaries (€433.8 million
in 2016}, most of them outside France. This figure includes payments
received in the last days of the financial year and subsequently
transferred to the cash pooling account.

Cash at bank and equivalents at year-end is invested solely in sight and
term bank deposits or in money market funds. At the date of publication,
Thales’ risk ratings were as follows:

Moody's S&P Global

Ratings

Medium & long-term loans AQ A
Outlook Negative Negative
watch

Commercial paper & short-term loans Prime-| A2

Moody's and S&P Global ratings downgraded their outlook (from
“stable to “negative” and “negative watch" respectively) following the
announcement on 17 December 2017 of the planned cash tender offer
for Gemalto. If this acquisition, partly financed from the Group's own
cash flow and partly through borrowings, goes ahead, it would in all

Management report — 2017 Financial Information

likelihood cause Thales’s rating to be lowered, due mainly to the
change in the Group's financing structure.

The decrease of Thales's credit risk rating would not trigger the financial
covenants included in its financing contracts. The coming into effect of
the unique clause providing for accelerated repayment of bank credit
facilities would only apply in the event that the French government no
longer held its golden share and, simultaneously, the ratio of consolidated
net financial debt to EBITDA {earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortisation) were to exceed 3.

A lower rating would result in an increase (capped) in the margins
applicable to the committed credit facility of €1.5 billion (described in
Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements); at the same time, these
margins would be improved (with a minimum threshold) in the event of a
rating upgrade.

1.1.2.3.2 Interest rates

Thales is exposed to interest-rate volatility and in particular its impact on
the conditions associated with variable-rate financing. To limit this risk,
Thales operates an active interest rate hedging policy.

The Corporate Financing and Treasury Department consolidates data
on Thales’s exposure to interest rate risk and uses appropriate financial
instruments to hedge those risks.

Thales policy is to control interest rate and counterpart risks and to
optimise its funding and banking operations.

The breakdown of Thales's debt by type of interest rate is described in
Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. The table below
summarises the Group's exposure to interest rate risk before and after
hedging. Based on the average net cash {taking into account hedging
instruments}, a 1% rise in interest rates would impact net financial interest
by €27.4 million in 2017 (€21.6 million in 2016}

1.1.2.3.3 Foreign exchange

Due to the international nature of its business, Thales is exposed to the
risk of exchange rate fluctuations

a) Business-related currency risk

Business-related currency risk occurs when some of the business is billed
in a currency other than that of the related costs

a. As a general tule, Thales is structurally immune to exchange rate
fluctuations for a significant part of its business activity. Around 40%
of Thales's sales are generated in the eurozone, where a significant
portion of its industrial operations are located. More generally, the
reinforcement of the Group's international industrial footprint allows it
to produce and invoice in local currency, which helps to reduce
exchange rate risk on local sales

b. The accounts of Thales'’s subsidiaries located in countries where the
functional currency is not the euro are translated into euros in the
Group's consolidated financial statements. A fall in these currencies
against the euro is likely to have a negative impact on the accounts.
lis impact on profitability is limited, however, since the cost base of
these subsidiaries is essentially in the same currency as their sales.
The main currencies concerned are the pound sterling, the US
dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar.

c. For certain Group businesses (commercial avionics and microwave
systems, commercial space, etc.), the US dollar ("$" or "USD") is the
reference transaction currency. For business activities outside the
dollar zone [the in-flight entertainment and connectivity business is
based essentially in the United States and is therefore naturally
immune to this risk], a specific currency risk hedging policy is
implemented

= for equipment transactions (avionics and microwave systems), this
policy is defined on the basis of sales forecasts in USD, after
accounting for corresponding purchases in USD. For these
transactions, net exposure to dollar risk represents around 3.5% of
the Group's total sales for 2017,

2017 Registration Document — THALES

2017 Financial Information — Management report

= for longer-term programmes in markets traditionally denominated
in USD (primarily commercial space activities), each bid is
examined for profitability in light of the effect of currency
fluctuations, after accounting for corresponding purchases in
USD, and, if necessary, is specifically hedged through market
transactions (forward exchange-rate contracts and options}

Where necessary, a similar approach is adopted for other Thales
activities if a customer specifically requires a contract denominated in
USD on an ad hoc basis.

Overall, net exposure amounted to around 2% of the Group's
total sales for 2017;

= as well as this direct dollar risk, which concerned around 5.5% in
total of consolidated sales at end-2017, the Group is also exposed
to an “indirect” dollar risk on contracts denominated in currencies
other than the dollar. This occurs when it is bidding against
companies that benefit from a cost base in dollars. At least one
quarter of total sales may be exposed to this “indirect” dollar risk.

The “dollar risk” is thus the main currency risk that Thales needs to manage
The figures corresponding to the management of business-related dollar
risk are as follows

© $2,496 million, the amount of financial instruments hedging net firm
commitments (US dollar risk against the euro, Canadian dollar and
pound sterling) at 31 December 2017 compared with
$2,985 million at 31 December 2016;

financial instruments (forward transactions) used to hedge bids in US
dollars against the euro, Canadian dollar and pound sterling
amounted to zero at 31 December 2017 versus $310 million at
31 December 2016.

Operating receivables and payables denominated in foreign currency
are exchange-rate hedged and therefore not exposed to currency risk.

The change in the value of financial instruments (forward transactions)
used to hedge cash flows is recognised in equity for the spot rate
component. A decrease (increase) of 5% in the dollar against the main

currencies (EUR, GBP and CAD}, would have increased (decreased)
shareholders’ equity by approximately €104 million at

1 December 2017 (€153 million at 31 December 2016}. The
premium/discount component is not eligible for hedge accounting and
is recognised through profit and loss. In 2017, the change in market
value of the premium/discount was -€65.3 million (compared to
-€54.0 million in 2016)

The change in value of financial instruments used to hedge commercial
bids which are not eligible for hedge accounting is recognised in profit
and loss. A decrease (increase) of 5% in the dollar against the main
currencies (EUR, GBP and CAD} would have had no impact on profit or
loss at 31 December 2017 or 3] December 2016

Foreign currency-denominated financial debt does not generate any
exposure in profit and loss, as it is either denominated in the functional
currency of the entity in which it is recognised or is used as a net foreign
investment hedge.

b) Management of risks relating to foreign
currency-denominated assets

The Group may hedge a portion of its foreign currency-denominated
assets, mainly those likely to be disposed of. The main criteria for
determining whether or not a given foreign currency denominated asset
should be hedged are as follows

the nature of the business operations involved;

the structure of Thales’s commitment with respect to jointly held companies,
in particular the specific features of the shareholders’ agreement in
each joint venture.

The actual application of his policy also depends on

e the objective of optimising hedges in light of market conditions
(availability of foreign currency, interest rates, hedging rate, etc.);

the risks inherent in the future value of the assets being hedged and
the nature of the business of the corresponding subsidiaries.

Thales was not exposed to any material equity risk at end-2017, excluding
the risk on treasury shares.

At 31 December 2017, Thales held 568,739 treasury shares, representing
0.27% of the share capital.

1.1.2.3.5 Pension commitments
Defined-benefit pension plans are in place for certain Group employees,

mainly in the UK, which are financed by the Group under the provisions
of the applicable domestic legislation. As such, at 31 December 2017,

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

Thales's pension commitments in the United Kingdom amounted to
€4,431.8 million, hedged by €3,248.7 million in investments,
representing an underlying shortfall of €1,183.1 million

Changing market parameters can lead to a substantial increase or
decrease in the amount of the shortfall and the annual costs of defined-
benefit plans. At 31 December 2017, the main sensitivity factors were
as follows:

© a decrease or increase in the discount rate applied to liabilities,
which could increase or reduce the underlying shortfall; this variable
is partly offset by changes in the value of fixed-rate hedging bonds
held as plan assets and interest rate swaps;

changes in the total return on investments in equities and other assets;


--- Page 20 ---

changes in the forecast inflation rate;
ea substantial change in mortality tables;
exchange rate fluctuations (mainly sterling against the euro).

Thales has introduced six-monthly reporting on its pension plan
commitments and makes regular projections measuring the sensitivity of
underlying shortfalls to possible market changes taking into account
their correlations. In the UK, Thales plan assets are managed by trustees
in accordance with the applicable regulations and in consultation with
the Group. Plan assets are allocated with regard to the long-term
maturity of the commitments they cover.

Additional information on the amount of commitments and the annual
costs linked to pension and other employee benefits, as well as the
valuation and allocation of plan assets and the sensitivity of net
commitments to different actuarial assumptions is given in Note 9.3 of
the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2017.

1.1.2.3.6 Sureties, endorsements
and guarantees granted
by Thales (parent company)

Thales (parent company) issues sureties, endorsements and guarantees,
primarily in support of commitments undertaken by its subsidiaries
through commercial contracts. The Group's Corporate Financing and
Treasury Department centralises the issuance of these sureties,
endorsements and guarantees.

They are issued out of an envelope of €4 billion, which is regularly
delegated by the Board of Directors to the Chairman and CEO. Before
each time the Chairman's authorisation is renewed, the extent of use of
this envelope, which is monitored by the Corporate Financing and
Treasury Department, is notified to the Board

As of 31 December 2017, outstanding sureties, endorsements and
guarantees granted by Thales (parent company] to its subsidiaries
amounted to €12,760.4 million. These guarantees include all
commitments given in relation to Thales Alenia Space, which are
backed by a counter guarantee from Leonardo in proportion to its
interest in the capital of Thales Alenia Space (33%).

Thales has initiated a programme to control risks related to these
sureties, endorsements and guarantees through the parent company
and to optimise the financial terms of transactions guaranteed using
these instruments with the following main objectives:

to limit the risks to those corresponding to normal commitments in
commercial contracts, particularly in terms of volume and duration;

to limit their issuance to commitments made by wholly owned
subsidiaries, with guarantees commitments involving business
combinations or joint ventures only being issued in proportion to the
Group's interest or counter-guaranteed by the other shareholder in
proportion to its interest;

to allow its subsidiaries to benefit, where appropriate, from the
credit quality of Thales (parent company), by controlling the financial
terms of guaranteed transactions.

1.1.2.3.7 Customer credit

Credit risk relates to the risk that a party to a contract will default on its
commitments or fail to pay what it owes.

a) Risk of default by private sector customers

Non-governmental customers (aircraft manufacturers, airlines, private
infrastructure operators and industry) account for approximately 25% of
Thales’s sales. These custorners may encounter major and/or prolonged
financial difficulties that could lead to payment defaults or order
cancellations. Such occurrences could have a negative impact on the
Group's sales, profitability and financial position

To mitigate these risks, Thales conducts regular analyses of the ability of
customers to meet their obligations. When necessary, Thales may request
bank guarantees or corporate guarantees, or may use credit insurers.

Management report — 2017 Financial Information

b) Credit risk relating to public sector customers

Public, government and institutional customers account for around 75%
of Thales's sales. Thales works with a large number of countries. Some
of them could present a significant credit risk which could, for example,
lead them to suspend an order in production, or render them unable to
pay on delivery, as agreed under the terms of the contract. To limit its
exposure to these risks, Thales takes out insurance with export credit
agencies [such as BPIFrance] or private insurers

At 31 December 2017, only three customers accounted for annual sales
in excess of €500 million: the French government (around €2.8 billion),
the UK government (around €1 billion) and the Australian government
(around €0.7 billion). At 31 December 2017, these three countries had
first-class or high-quality ratings (France was rated AA by S&P and Aa2
by Moody's, the United Kingdom was rated AA by S&P and Aa2 by
Moody’s, and Australia was rated AAA by S8P and Aaa by Moody's)

1.1.2.4 Insurance

Thales's Insurance and Risk Management department, based at head
office and reporting to the SEVP Finance & Information Systems,
is responsible for insurance activities and insurable risk management.
It is in charge of Group operations and oversees policy implementation
by Group companies.

The Group is covered against the financial consequences of the risk of
accidental damage suffered or caused by property or people using
appropriate insurance policies with leading international insurance and
reinsurance companies

The insurance policies arranged by the Group to cover these major risks
relate fo areas such as:

damage to property and consequent operating losses;

transport;

assembling and testing;

aviation liability, including liability for aeronautical products and
hull/test flight insurance;

liability for space products;

risks of damage to or by naval vessels by subsidiaries, as nava
equipment suppliers;

general third-party liability;

environmental liability;

liability of executive officers and directors;

individual accident — repatriation assistance for employees on
assignment;

© cyber liability

The Group had no major loss in 2017

The Group's policy is to arrange cover on the insurance market based
on the rates and within the limits that it considers reasonable, in view of
the conditions offered by the market. Insurance policies covering the
major risks may be limited in terms of guarantee (application of limits),
while general exclusions for the entire market (e.g. asbestos) also apply
to Thales.

In 2017, the maximum coverage limit for insurance against damage to
property and consequent operating losses was €1.3 billion. This limit
takes into account the estimated maximum possible loss caused to an
industrial site which the Group could incur in this regard. In 2017, the
Group renewed a specific cover against cyber incidents (IT data attack)
and damages that could compromise its internal IT systems.

Levels of liability cover depend on the quantification of a reasonable
claim expectancy for Thales, as identified by the risk map of the main
business activities and at Group level, and on cover capacity available
on the insurance market. The insurance coverage for aviation liability
commitments, which is covered by a specific programme, is capped at

$2 billion

The insurance industry depends on the financial markets. There are
therefore no guarantees that Thales will be able to maintain current
levels of insurance under similar financial conditions in the future.

information — Management report

In order to reduce its exposure to insurance market volatility, Thales
insures major risks on a two-tier basis:

¢ the Group's contribution, through captive insurance and reinsurance
companies, towards the settlement of claims, to a maximum net
retention of €12 million per year, for damage to property and
consequent operating losses, transport, general third-party liability,
assembling and testing, development and space risks;

transfer to insurers of payment for catastrophic or high intensity
losses

In parallel, an active Prevention and Protection policy for industrial sites
is designed to reduce the magnitude and frequency of the accidental
risks of fire or explosion and to detect other exposures, such as
environmental or natural disasters and the vulnerability of critical
industrial facilities. In 2017, more than 70% of the assets insured were
the subject of a “multi-peril” audit by the insurers during their visits to the

principal operating sites and infrared thermography inspections by an
outside organisation specialised in the prevention of electrical damage.

In accordance with Group processes, measures were taken fo minimise
business interruption and the consequences of any unforeseen events.
An organisational structure and crisis management tools are in place to
deal as efficiently as possible with the immediate consequences of a
catastrophic event and to take the necessary emergency measures.

A tisk prevention policy for critical supplier sites was also pursued to
reduce the risk of operating losses for Thales in the event of an
accidental disaster at one of their sites

Furthermore, Thales continues to roll out an insurance policy for its staff
to cover them in the context of their professional activity. Lastly, specific
and/or local cover has been arranged to comply with the regulations in
force and to satisfy the specific requirements of certain business
activities or projects, particularly public-private partnerships.

1.1.3 Internal control and risk management

This section was submitted to the Audit and Accounts Committee at its
meeting of 15 February 2018, attended by the statutory auditors. It was
prepared on the basis of the main conclusions from the internal audit,
internal control and risk management work carried out by the Group in
2017. The results of this work were reviewed at the various meetings of
the Risk Assessment Committee and the Risk Management Committee
(see Section 1.1.3.5) during the year, and also at meetings of the Audit
and Accounts Committee held in 2017.

This section is based on the AMF reference framework on risk
management and internal control systems, updated on 22 July 2010.

lt covers all the suggested items, albeit sometimes in a different order.

1.1.3.1 Objectives and definitions

a) Objectives of risk management

Thales adheres to the risk management objectives formalised by the
AMF in its reference framework. Risk management is a management
tool that Thales uses to:

Create and preserve the value, assets and reputation of the Group

Risk management identifies and analyses the main threats and potential
opportunities to which the Group is exposed. By anticipating the
potential impact of these risks, it is intended to more effectively preserve
the value, assets and reputation of the Group.

e Secure the Group's decision-making
and processes to help it achieve its objectives

Risk analysis is designed to identify the principal events and situations
which could significantly impact the achievement of the Group's
objectives. Controlling such risks helps to achieve those objectives.

Risk management is integral to the Group's decision-making and
operational processes. It is one of the tools for steering and assisting in
decision-making

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

Risk management gives executives an objective and comprehensive
vision of potential threats and opportunities to which the Group is exposed,
enabling them to take measured and considered risks and guiding them in
their decisions on the allocation of human and financial resources.

e Promote the consistency of action with the values of the Group

The Group's approach to risk management is consistent with its values,
particularly with regard to the strict compliance of its business activities
with national and international rules and legislation

Involve the Group's employees in a shared vision of the main
risks and make them aware of the risks inherent in their work

b) Definition of internal control at Thales

The Group uses as a reference the international standards of COSO
2013 (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission) and IFACI

According to the definition used by Thales, internal control is a process
that the organisation implements with the intention of providing reasonable
assurance as to the achievement of the Group's objectives, through

© the effectiveness and efficiency of internal processes;

accounting and financial internal control aimed at:
= ensuring the reliability of the information used internally for
management and monitoring purposes as well as for the
preparation of the published accounting and financial information,
= preventing the risk of fraud ;

legal compliance, which is intended to ensure compliance with
regulatory requirements.

<) Scope of application and limits

Thales implements its corporate risk management and internal control
approach in the companies it controls.

These internal control and risk management processes contribute to the
achievement of the Group's objectives without providing an absolute
guarantee because of the limitations inherent in any system, such as the
need to take into account the cost/benefit ratio leading to acceptance
of a certain level of risk, and due to external uncertainties beyond the
Group's control


--- Page 22 ---

1.1.3.2 Control environment

For most of its operations, the Group is subject to a control environment
imposed by its customers and regulatory authorities (Ministries of
Defence and Industry, Authorities in its customers’ countries, Commercial
Aviation Authorities, etc.), which require strict certification and controls.

These specific constraints are in addition to its statutory obligations and
are an integral part of the Group's control environment.

a) The main parties in risk management and internal control

Thales is organised according to a two-dimensional matrix structure
comprising Global Business Units and countries.

¢ The Global Business Units are organised into business lines, which
cover a coherent range of products, solutions and services.

For the products, solutions and services entrusted to them, the
business lines have worldwide responsibilty for strategy, product policy
and marketing, competitiveness, customer access, contractual
commitments, engineering, development, production, integration,
quality and services, industrial organisations, optimisation of resources,
and economic performance (contribution to EBIT and cash flow)

In the region assigned to them, country managers are responsible
for the successful implementation of every aspect of Group policy
and handle relations with customers and local partners.

The main countries in which the Group operates (Australia, Canada,
France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United
States) share responsibility with the Global Business Units for local bids
and projects. Country managers are involved in all decisions taken
by the Global Business Units with regard to organisation and
appointments, or relating to bids, projects and centres of excellence of
any kind in their territories. They are responsible for HR development
and the optimisation of industrial resources. They are also responsible
for Thales's institutional relations as well as for communication.

The country manager of each of the six major industrial countries
(excluding France} in which the Group operates (see list above] reports
to a Non-Executive Chairman, appointed from among the Group's
senior executives. The Non-Executive Chairman acts an interface
between the country and head office and liaises between the Country
Manager and Executive Committee.

For the other countries in Europe (apart from those with a Non-Executive
Chairman, see above], the country or regional Manager reports to the
Europe and International Operations depariment, which in turn reports
to the Senior Executive Vice President, Operations & Performance.

In all other regions (Africa, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East),
the country or regional manager reports to the Senior Executive Vice
President, International Development.

The Group defines common processes and internal rules on delegation
setting out the way in which responsibility is shared, provides entities
with the corresponding tools and sets up umbrella departments.

The delegations are implemented in legal entities coordinated at
national level.

The Group’s managing bodies

These consist of Global Business Units, countries and functional
departments and are ultimately responsible for the Group's entire
internal control system, relying in particular on internal processes and
the work of the Risk Management Committee and the Risk Assessment
Committee.

The Group's governance is founded on the key principle of the
responsibility of the directors of operational entities, who are
responsible for establishing and maintaining the risk management and
internal control system within their operational entities.

Management report — 2017 Financial Information

The corporate risk assessment function

Since 2007, the Audit, Risks & Internal Control Department has
included a corporate risk analysis function. This is the responsibility of a
dedicated team, separate from the audit team, which provides support
to all operating and functional managers to help them identify and
assess the risks to which their activities are exposed and to institute
the means to manage or reduce these risks. It is also responsible for
developing and updating internal control assessment tools, such as the
yearly attestation letter and the internal control questionnaire, and
collating and analysing the responses given by the operational entities
in these annual questionnaires.

The internal audits conducted by the Audit, Risks & Internal Control
Department are primarily chosen and planned based on this risk
analysis

Finance function

The Group's Finance Department oversees the Company's accounting
and financial operations. Its central organisation comprises:

* an accounting and consolidation function, responsible for preparing
and presenting the Group's consolidated financial statements;

a management and budget control function, which analyses the
Group's financial data and produces monthly reports comparing
actual results with the budget and comparable prior-year periods.
On this occasion, financial forecasts for the current half-year and
financial year are reviewed and discussed so as to steer the business
in order to achieve the objectives set;

a tax function, which provides support to the operational entities on
legislation and during tax audits. It also monitors tax consolidation
within the Group and ensures their overall coherence;

© a tisk and prevention insurance function, which manages all insurance
policies taken out by the Group to guarantee all of its companies,
optimises the costs of these policies, verifies that the companies are
properly covered against insurable risks that they incur and issues
recommendations to prevent them. It also monitors any significant claims;

a treasury and financing function, which optimises financial resources
and manages the Group's financial risks (foreign exchange, interest
rates, pensions, etc.);

© a financial engineering function, in support of commercial contracts
to offer customers suitable financing, secure payments to be
received and hedge against the financial consequences of contract
interruption which could arise in particular in the event of political
risk or risk of customer default.

The Group's Finance department is represented in each Global
Business Unit, each operational entity and each of the main countries
by a Finance Director who functionally reports to it. The implementation
of the accounting and financial internal control is carried out by these
Finance Directors, who have local teams within their scope of
responsibility to ensure that the financial information is prepared in
compliance with the rules on internal control,

At the time of the annual and half-year financial statements, the Chief
Executive Officers and the Finance Directors issue a letter of
representation to the Group's Finance department, certifying the fair
presentation and completeness of the financial data submitted for
consolidation.

Legal function

The Group's Legal & Contracts Department, as well as the legal counsel
in the various countries and Global Business Units, provide support to
the operational entities with regard to local and international laws, in
order to manage any potential legal risks that may be incurred in the
various fields of the law.

2017 Registration Document — THALES

information — Management report

The Group's Human Resources department also has a network of legal
advisors who specialise in employment law and who provide support
to the Group's entities. The Legal & Contracts Department and
the Human Resources Department call upon outside law firms, where
necessary,

Operations and performance function

The Operations and Performance department is responsible for the
operational resources necessary fo carry out projects and ensure
customer satisfaction and quality, thus contributing to risk management.
lt approves the most sensitive bids according to specific criteria and
holds quarterly reviews of projects deemed critical. It manages skills
development plans as well as bid and project manager certification
plans. It rolls out and upgrades bid costing and project management
tools and provides ad hoc support to any Global Business Units and
countries requesting it. In each entity, the Director of Operations
coordinates, in close collaboration with the Legal Director and the
Finance Director, the management of all of the Company's risks.

The Operations and Performance department includes the Quality
Assurance and Customer Satisfaction Department, which defines the
quality assurance policy and objectives and drives improvements in
customer satisfaction. It steers the process management framework
(Chorus 2.0) applicable to all Group entities. Each process is entrusted
to a manager who is responsible for defining rules and setting targets,
as well as for implementing them and making sure that they are
effective. This translates into process targets being achieved while
reducing tisk. Quality assurance procedures for offers, projects and
products are carried out by the operational entities, in order to
effectively meet customer demands and ensure customer satisfaction
and secure the execution of operations

In addition, the Quality Assurance and Customer Satisfaction function
manages the policy in place for assessing the maturity of operational
entities (see description in Section 1.1.3.4-a}

b) The Group's operating principles and procedures

Thales's operating principles and procedures underpin the Group's
internal control. This set of organisational rules, policies and
procedures, which includes rules on ethical conduct and corporate
responsibility, is available on the Group intranet and is provided to all
new employees in their welcome pack.

Reference system

Thales has created a process-based reference system called Chorus
2.0, which defines the organisation, rules, practices and methods to be
implemented at each Group entity.

Thanks to its modular design, it can be adapted to the business context
and can be augmented within each entity or country, by local rules and
practices detailed in a technical reference system.

Chorus 2.0 is accessible via the intranet, making it easy to locate the
policies, procedures, instructions, templates and forms which need to
be used. Chorus 2.0 covers nine headline processes, sub-divided into
26 processes. These processes, which are closely interfaced — and
identify activities that require attention with regard to the potential for
risks to occur — precisely define how Thales works according to the
roles, rules, practices and operating modes described

This reference system gives all Group companies a shared language
and a unified management process. Chorus 2.0 is also aimed at
organisational alignment across the Group.

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

Chorus 2.0 is a vital tool to enable each entity to have its management
systems certified — on a Group wide platform — in terms of quality,
health, safety and environment and with regard to the norms and
standards applicable to each business activity.

Chorus 2.0 is a crucial element of the Group's internal control and is a
natural component of the reference systems used in the work of the
Audit, Risks & Internal Control Department.

Rules of procedure of the Board of Directors

Section 3.2.1 provides more details on the Board of Directors, its rules of
procedure and its operation

Codes and guides of conduct

The code of Conduct defines the types of conduct that are prohibited as
they may be construed as acts of corruption or influence peddling. The
Code applies to all employees of the Group. It has been incorporated
into the internal regulations of the Group's French companies and is in
the process of being rolled out to its foreign subsidiaries.

Iris supplemented by the Code of Ethics and a set of guides published
in the Groups framework

The Code of Ethics, published in eight languages, is the bedrock of
Thales's culture of integrity. It sets out the rules of conduct and the values
that the Group wants to develop. It covers relationships with customers
and suppliers, partners, employees, shareholders and financial markets,
as well as protection of the environment.

A business ethics reference guide is dedicated to the prevention of
corruption. It describes the rules and regulations that must be respected
internally.

Several business ethics conduct guides present the best practices
expected from employees with regard to anti-corruption measures, gifts
and hospitality, conflicts of interest, lobbying and the use of the
professional whistleblowing system

A reference guide entitled “Compliance with Export Control Regulations"
describes the compliance requirements and the process of export
control. It identifies stakeholders, defines their responsibilities, and sets
out best practices in terms of compliance with export control regulations.

As part of its policy of preventing insider trading, the Group has
adopted a Code on Insider Trading for directors, and regularly updates
the list of insiders (see Section 3.2.1).

An e-learning platform also helps to educate the Group's employees on
topics such as export controls, ethics and corporate responsibility.

c) Group risk mapping

The Group has mapped its major operational, strategic, compliance
and financial risks. It updates this risk map each year.

Each risk factor identified is set out in risk scenarios prioritised on the
basis of two analysis criteria, before and after mitigation: likelihood of
occurrence and financial impact

The Group has assigned each of these risks to a risk advisor who is
responsible for coordinating the management of this risk under the
supervision of the Risk Assessment Committee. This consists of
characterising the risk, monitoring major incidents, overseeing the
deployment of the risk management system and continuously improving it.


--- Page 24 ---

1.1.3.3. Principal corporate risks
and their management

The section on risk factors in the Group management report (see
Section 1.1.2) describes the measures taken by the Group to address
operational, strategic, legal and compliance and financial risks and
risks related to insurance.

a) Centralised activities

Some complex or risky transactions are carried out solely by central
departments, which ensure the sharing, consistency and coordination of
the Group's practices. A specific internal control mechanism has been
put in place to manage the risks associated with these transactions.

Investments and divestments

Total or partial acquisitions and disposals come under the exclusive
remit of the Group's corporate management. The Global Business Units
propose projects at periodic meetings of the Mergers and Acquisitions
Committee, made up of the main central departments

Financing, treasury management and foreign exchange risk

The Group's financial resources, liquidity risk and interest rate risk are
managed centrally by the Group Treasury and Financing department.
Except in special cases, the Group's subsidiaries are not authorised to
undertake financing operations themselves. According to the policy of
optimising and centralising the Group's financial resources, the Group
Treasury and Financing department provides funding to the subsidiaries,
manages surplus cash positions in all of the Group's currencies and
matches surpluses with cash requirements. The Group Treasury and
Financing department is also responsible for managing the Group's
currency position and hedging the associated risks [in particular the
foreign exchange tisks to which the subsidiaries are exposed, which
are closely monitored at the subsidiary level). Foreign currency
transactions are analysed prior to any financial commitment and are
hedged against foreign exchange tisk as soon as the likelihood of
being awarded the sales contract and/or signing a purchase order
becomes significant, excluding special cases.

Customer financing and hedging of contract interruption
and credit risks

The International Financial Affairs department coordinates and
supervises the Group's financial engineering activities (establishment of
advance market commitments, customer financing (buyer or supplier
credit), documentary credits or more complex transactions such as
project financing or PPP]. These transactions are carried out in
collaboration with those responsible for the financial engineering of
international activities, who report to their Finance department and also
to the International Financial Affairs department.

Real estate management

All real estate transactions come under the exclusive remit of the Group's
Real Estate Depariment. It may delegate certain operations, especially
outside France, to a national organisation, or to a local company, while
ensuring proper supervision

Disputes, litigation and legal compliance

With the exception of disputes concerning relationships with employees
and trade unions, which are handled by the Human Resources
Department, other disputes are monitored by the Legal and Contracts
Department

Insurance and prevention (of insurable risks)

All of the insurance policies taken out by the Group are managed by
the Insurance and Prevention of Insurable Risks Department. It optimises

Management report — 2017 Financial Information

the coverage and cost of insurance for the Group, checks that the
entities are guaranteed against the insurable risks they incur, and issues
recommendations for their prevention. This Department also monitors
any significant claims.

b) Development and processing of published financial
and accounting information

Accounting and financial procedures

The Group has several procedural manuals applicable in all entities
and reiterated in the processes defined in Chorus 2.0. The Finance
Directors of each entity are accountable to the Group Finance
department for compliance with these procedures

Manual of accounting standards and policies

This manual provides a detailed description of the accounting standards
and policies to be applied during the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements in accordance with IFRS.

Budgetary control manual

This manual describes the hierarchy and reporting levels required by the
Group, the financial cycles, the responsibilities of the Finance
depariment in operational processes and the rules to be followed by all
Group entities

Reporting manual

This manual describes the content and format of periodic reports and
contains a glossary to help standardise financial aggregates.

Cash management manual

This manual describes the respective roles of central teams and teams
within each entity in respect of cash flow and financing operations

lt also details the procedures for short-term cash flow management,
operation of the exchange risk hedging system and the related
reporting rules.

Internal control questionnaire

The internal control questionnaire and the accompanying instructions
provide an additional framework and help to improve the reliability of
financial reporting while at the same time preventing the risk of fraud
These elements, which have gradually been incorporated into the
process management framework and distributed to the entire Group,
are effectively equivalent to an internal financial control manual

Budget process
There are three stages in setting the annual budgetary targets:

e the Global Business Units draw up a strategic plan over a minimum
period of four years, which can be adjusted depending on their
business models; this is then presented to and approved by Group
corporate management;

e each Global Business Unit, each major country, the Europe and
International Operations Department and the International
Development Department then present a detailed three-year budget
plan to Group corporate management. This plan is based on the
sales forecasts and assumptions prepared by the marketing and
sales departments, in accordance with the strategic plans prepared
by the Global Business Units;

finally, Group corporate management sets targets for the Global
Business Units, the main countries, the Europe and International
Operations department and the International department, ensuring
that they are consistent overall. The first year of the plan is then
analysed monthly and is used as a reference for steering the Group

Financial reporting

The system includes some of the key factors described earlier in this
report, such as accounting and financial procedures and a centralised
consolidation process supported by a single tool

Monthly results are analysed in order to identify any budget deviations
and to update annual forecasts for orders, sales, profits and cash flow.
This procedure is carried out by each entity and provides a
consolidated view at Global Business Unit and Group level. It also
makes it possible to identify any action plans necessary to achieve the
objectives set.

Consolidation of the financial statements

The teams in charge of consolidation ensure that changes in regulations
and standards are taken into account. They use the same consolidation
software throughout the Group, selected from those available on the
market, which enables it to upload the accounting information from the
Group's various entities with consistency checks carried out at source.
Transfers of accounting entries to head office are authorised only after
validation. Training sessions and personalised support on the tool within
the Group's consolidation teams ensure that users operate the software
effectively.

1.1.3.4 Ongoing improvement
process

Thales has introduced internal and external assessments, based on
international standards, enabling the Group to identify any areas
requiring continuous improvement, to prioritise these and to monitor the
associated action plans

a) Assessment of the maturity of operational entities

Thales has developed an internal system for assessing the maturity of
its operational entities, known as the Thales Integrated Maturity System.
It is used for:

bid, project and product management;
e development, production, facilities and deployment;
¢ purchasing, quality, support activities and services.

An assessment may cover an entire organisation or be restricted to a
specific element of said organisation, such as a project or product.
Whatever the scope, the system considers three components
organisation and management, resources and skills, and processes,
practices and tools.

Maturity assessments are performed by experienced assessors who are
recognised in their field as well as by the quality managers at each
operational entity.

The maturity model covers all of the Chorus 2.0 management system
processes and is fully compliant with international standards, such as:

the international CMMI® (Capability Maturity Model Integration)
model, which is recognised by many customers for its development,
acquisition and services models;

© the international Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR?) model

Process management

Thales has obtained and maintains, in its different activities, certifications
of compliance with applicable standards and regulations that attest to
its ability to manage its processes to meet the needs of its customers

For quality and for all Group activities, the certification standard is ISO
9001, and, depending on the business activities, the following
standards are also used (non-exhaustive list)

e AQAP 2110, NATO quality standard for the defence sector;

* EN 9100, European standard describing a quality assurance
system for the Aerospace industry;

e EASA Part 21 subpart G for production activities (Europe);

e EASA Part 145 (Europe) and FAR 145 (USA) for maintenance activities;

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

e EASA Part 147 for aeronautical training and maintenance;
ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 for Environment, Health & Safety at
wot.

b) Self-assessment and ongoing improvement
of corporate risk management

Since 2007, the Group has had a corporate risk management process
in place for all the businesses and subsidiaries it controls

In 2017, the Group's risk mapping process identified and measured the
potential frequency and impact of 56 risk scenarios, with operational
responsibility for each being specifically allocated to one of the following
three management structures:

¢ local entities, segments or Country Business Units;
© Global Business Units or Business Lines;
© central functions

The processes defined in Chorus 2.0, the insurance policy, the
self-assessment and internal control tools, and the internal and external
audits form part of the management of these risks.

Every year, the local entities report on the risk scenarios under their
responsibility, in the form of a questionnaire (yearly attestation letter),
updated annually and completed by the heads of the operational
entities and their management teams. In 2017, 110 questionnaires were
completed by the Group's operational entities. The responses to these
questionnaires are analysed by the Audit, Risks & Internal Control
Department, and by the network of risk advisors. A sample of
questionnaires are checked for accuracy and compliance by the Audit,
Risks & Internal Control Department: in 2017, 15 questionnaires were
subject fo an internal audit.

<) Self-assessment and ongoing improvement
of internal financial control

Drawing in particular on the AMF recommendation entitled “Reference
framework for risk management and internal control systems” and in
collaboration with its statutory auditors, the Group asks its financial
community to complete an internal control questionnaire (ICQ) focusing
on the reliability of financial processes and the prevention of fraud

The ICQ is based on internal control objectives linked to the Group's
processes and accounting cycles (customers/suppliers/fixed assets, etc.)
and is designed to enable the entities to identify areas of improvement,
whether these are due to control objectives that have not yet been
completely achieved, insufficient control in practice, or procedures that
need to be improved. In 2017, 132 questionnaires were completed,
representing all of the operational entities plus the shared services

1.1.3.5 Oversight of the internal
control and risk
management system

a) Monitoring and control bodies

The Board of Directors exercises control over the management of the
Group, either directly or through its committees. Detailed information on
the organisation of the Board's work and, more generally, the
performance of the Board and its committees is given in Section 3.2.1
of the corporate governance report.

Audit and Accounts Committee

At the meetings of this committee to the Board of Directors, the
resources employed, actions taken to improve internal control and risk
identification and management are reviewed. In 2017, this committee
met six times.

Each year, the Audit, Risks & Internal Control Department submits an
audit plan to the Audit and Accounts Committee covering various
aspects relating to the Group in respect of compliance with legislation
and regulations, assessment of internal control and tisk identification
and management.


--- Page 26 ---

At the time of the annual closing of the accounts, the Senior Executive
Vice President, Finance and Information Systems presents a report on
risk exposure and significant off-balance sheet commitments to the Audit
and Accounts Committee.

Risk Management Committee

This committee, chaired by the Chairman and CEO, is responsible for
defining the level of risk deemed acceptable by the Group, allocating
risk management and control responsibilities for these risks, defining the
strategy for transferring certain risks to insurance, approving the Group's
risk mapping, and more generally, ensuring that the risk assessment and
management system is as comprehensive as possible in order to
maximise risk mitigation. It is supported by the work of the Risk Assessment
Committee. In 2017, this committee met once.

Risk Assessment Committee

This committee is chaired by the Senior Vice President, Audit,
Risks & Internal Control. It is responsible for analysing risks and evolving
threats; it updates and prioritises risk scenarios, ensuring that
responsibility for each risk scenario is allocated within the Group,
prepares risk maps and formulates recommendations for the Risk
Management Committee, with a view to improving the overall
management and mitigation of Group risks. In 2017, the Risk Assessment
Committee met five times.

Ethics and Corporate Responsibility Committee

This committee, chaired by the Company Secretary, is composed of
representatives of the functional departments and the main countries in
which the Group is based. Its work is focused on three areas:

© Strategy:
= contribute to the definition of Thales’s policy on Ethics and Corporate
Responsibility,

= identifying and making recommendations with regard to the
standards and procedures concerning sales, environmental,
human-resource-related and social issues;

© Ownership:
= ensuring that the internal Codes are kept up to date and implemented
within Thales,
= defining training objectives and suitable means of communication,
= coordinating and monitoring the Country Ethics Committees and
ethics officers;

© Sharing
= holding discussions amongst its members on good practices,
experiences and the ethical issues submitted to it.

In 2017, this committee met three times.

The Ethics and Corporate Responsibility department is responsible for
the Group's actions in terms of ethics and responsibility, coordinating
the relevant people within the Group, and ensuring that the ethical
issues submitted to it are handled and followed up correctly, through an
ad hoc committee where necessary.

Management report — 2017 Financial Information

Group Internal Audit, Risks & Internal Control Department

Reporting to the Group General Secretary, the Audit, Risks & Internal
Control Department principally works with the Audit and Accounts
Committee, the Risk Management Committee, the Risk Assessment
Committees, Group corporate management and the statutory auditors.

lt ensures proper risk management and the maintenance of adequate
internal control by conducting audits or providing guidance. It may have
involvement throughout the Group [Thales parent company and its
controlled subsidiaries) as well as with its non-controlled subsidiaries,
with the agreement of the co-owner companies. lis scope of involvement
covers all areas and processes (governance, administrative, accounting
and financial, functional and operational, etc.)

Since 2006, the Audit, Risks & Internal Control Depariment has been
certified by IFACI", which ensures that its practices comply with the
international auditing standards. The last IA/IFACI triennial certification
was obtained by the Audit, Risks & Internal Control Department in
March 2016. The annual progress visit made by IFACI in March 2017
confirmed the Department's capacity and that of its auditors to
coordinate their activities and operate in accordance with the
prerequisites and the core principles of the internal audit profession.

The actions of the Audit, Risks & Internal Control Department are
governed by an Internal Audit charter (updated in June 2016) that
defines the basic principles of internal control and internal audit, the
scope and limits of its responsibilities and its interaction with the entities.

In 2017, 63 audits or advisory engagements, arising from the Group's
tisk analysis and planned according to the criteria set out and
approved by the Audit and Accounts Committee, were conducted by
teams from the Audit, Risks & Internal Control Department. These
engagements focused on the following themes:

Operations: bids and projects, product policy, engineering and
industry;

Compliance: ethics, export control, security of information systems,
business continuity plans;

e Governance: organisation, shared services, joint ventures,
monitoring of acquisition and divestment transactions;

¢ Internal control: auditing the accuracy of risk management and
internal control questionnaires (yearly attestation letter, internal
control questionnaire),

b) Audit of financial information

Each year, the Finance department reviews the financial audit manual
with the statutory auditors. This manual describes the phases for the use
of external auditors.

Consolidated companies are placed in one of three categories,
according to their size and the risks to which they may be exposed
They may be subject to an in-depth review, a limited review or a
review for statutory requirements.

In the first two types of review, as well as assessing the financial
statements, the statutory auditors recommend improvements in terms of
internal control. These recommendations are presented to Group
management as part of the closure of the accounts at 31 December.

Implementation of IFRS 15
The Group continued to work on the implementation of IFRS 15, which

became mandatory as of | January 2018

Thales has opted for the full retrospective approach; the financial

In this context, the Group has estimated the impact of the new standard

on the key indicators for 2017:

EBIT 1,542.6 (177.2) 1,365.4

The main sources of differences between the current rules and IFRS 15 are
the following

Order Backlog

IFRS 15 introduces the concept of accounting order backlog ("transaction
price allocated to the remaining performance obligation"). This
accounting definition compared to Thales current definition, does not
lead to significant impact.

Unbundling of multiple performance obligations
within a single contract

In certain situations, IFRS 15 requires the unbundling of multiple
performance obligations within a single contract, with differentiated margin
rates. This is the case for some contracts combining construction and
maintenance services, or construction and launch of a satellite. However,
the impact of this restatement on the 2017 financial statements is limited.

Recognition of revenue under the percentage
of completion method

Under the current rules, revenue from construction contracts (representing
cover half the Group's revenue] is recognised according to the percentage
of completion method

IFRS 15 now provides for criteria proving the transfer of control over
goods and services to the customer over time and allowing for the
recognition of revenue under the percentage of completion method.

For complex sales of goods, it is necessary to demonstrate that the good
sold has no alternative use and that the Group has an irrevocable right
to payment for the work performed to date (corresponding to the costs
incurred to date, plus a reasonable margin), in the event of termination
for any reason other than Thales's failure to perform. Detailed analysis
of the Group's contract portfolio has confirmed that, for the vast majority
of contracts in progress, the criteria defined in IFRS 15 have been met.

In addition, as was the case before, revenue from services contracts will
be recognised according to the percentage of completion method, with
the customer receiving services as they are provided by Thales.

Percentage of completion method

Currently, the revenue and margin of construction contracts are recognised
as and when the technical milestones, which confirm effective progress
of a part of the works or completion of the services specified in the
contract, are achieved. Under IFRS 15, the percentage of completion
method used is expense based: revenue is recognised based on costs
incurred to date in relation to all the costs expected upon completion.
For each contract, depending on the pace of performance and the

2017 Registration Document — THALES


--- Page 37 ---

2017 Financial Information — Consolidated financial statements

nature of the milestones achieved and costs incurred over the period,
this change in method may cause shifts in revenue and margin
recognition from one period to another.

Bid cost

Bid cost which were previously included in contract costs, in accordance
with IAS 11, are now expensed as incurred as a line item under “marketing
and selling expenses”

Other standards

The assessment of the potential impacts of these new standards for the
Group's consolidated financial statements is underway.

The new IFRS 9 on financial instruments introduces

e a new classification of financial assets based on the Group's
management intention and the nature of expected flows;
a dynamic impairment model for financial assets on expected losses;

1.3 Translation

changes in rules relating to hedge accounting [and especially the
treatment of the time value of options as a cost of hedging, which
limits net income volatily)

This standard will come into effect on 1 January 2018. The review and
analysis of the text is still in progress, but the Group does not at this stage
anticipate any material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

The Group is also reviewing the new IFRS 16 “leases”, which is effective
as from on | January 2019. This text, which replaces IAS 17 and the
associated IFRIC and SIC interpretations, removes the distinction previously
made between operating leases and finance leases. Under IFRS 16, a
lessee recognises a rightof-use asset and a financial liability representative
of the lease obligation. The right-of-use asset is amortised and the lease
obligation is measured initially at the present value of the lease payments
over the lease term, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease if that can
be readily determined or at the incremental borrowing rate otherwise

Work is under way to apply these new provisions, with most contracts
concerning property leases

The principal exchange rates used to translate financial statements of entities with a functional currency different from the euro are as follows:

U.S. Dollar 1.1993 1.1370 1.0541 1.1032 1.0887 1046

1.4 Main sources of estimates

The preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements
involves making estimates and assumptions, which have an impact on
the valuation of the Group's performance and its consolidated assets
and liabilities. These estimates are based on past experience and factor
in the economic conditions prevailing at the end of the reporting period
and any information available as of the date on which the financial
statements are prepared.

In today’s global economic environment, the degree of volatility and
subsequent lack of visibility are particularly high. Future facts and circumstances
could lead to changes in these estimates or assumptions which would
affect the Group's financial situation, profit and loss and cash flows, notably
with regard to:

Construction contracts (Note 10.1)

A significant part of the Group's revenue and current operating income
stems from construction contracts recognised according to the technical
percentage of completion method. These contracts often span several
financial years. In the accounting closing process, the recognition of
income and expenses relating to these contracts depends mainly:

¢ onesiimates of revenue and margin upon completion, including provisions
for technical and commercial risks;

technical milestones achieved in the performance of these contracts.

Estimates of figures upon completion, and the achievement of technical
milestones, are based, for each contract, on the Group's internal
systems and procedures, with the project managers playing a key role.
These estimates are reviewed regularly by the Operations department
and the Finance department, under the supervision of the Group's
Corporate Management, particularly at each reporting period-end.

44 THALES — 2017 Registration Document

Litigation (Note 11)

The Group conducts its business in France and abroad in complex,
evolving legal and regulatory environments. As a result, it is exposed to legal,
technical and commercial disputes.

The Group regularly identifies and reviews litigation in progress and
recognises the accounting provisions that it considers to be reasonable
in light of the circumstances. Any uncertainties concerning litigation
in progress are described in Note 11

Business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for in accordance with the purchase
accounting method described in Note 13-b: on the date of the takeover of
a company, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities are measured at their fair value. These valuations are performed
by independent experts who base their work on assumptions and estimate
the effects of future events, which are uncertain at the acquisition date.

Goodwill (Note 4.1)

Goodwill is subject to impairment tests. The recoverable amount of goodwill
is assessed based on forecast data from the strategic plans prepared
in accordance with Group procedures. Sensitivity tests are carried out on
key assumptions which lend greater weight to the conclusions reached.

Pensions and other long-term employee benefits (Note 9.3)

Pensions and other long-term employee benefit commitments are
estimated on statistical and actuarial bases in accordance with the policies
outlined in the Note 13-j. Actuarial assumptions made by the Group
(discount rates, inflation rate, mortality tables, etc.) are reviewed each year
with the Group's actuaries.

Deferred tax assets (Note 7)

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carryforwards and
temporary differences between the book value and the tax value of assets
and liabilities. Recovery of these assets is assessed on the basis of the
forecast data in the strategic plans of each of the tax groups considered,
and generally over a period of five years.

NOTE 2. SEGMENT INFORMATION

2.1 Information by

business segment

The operational segments presented by the Group are as follows:

e the Aerospace segment, which combines the “Avionics” and
"Space" Global Business Units that develop on-board systems,
solutions and services, mainly for private sector customers (aircraft
manufacturers, airlines, satellite operators, etc.) but also to a lesser
extent for government/defence customers states, space agencies
and other semi-public organisations};

the Transport segment, which comprises the “Ground Transportation
Systems” Global Business Unit that develops systems and services
for an exclusively civilian customer base of ground transportation

e the Defence and Security segment, which combines the “Secure
Communications and Information Systems”, “Land and Air Systems"
and “Defence Mission Systems” Global Business Units that develop
equipment, systems and services for the armed and security forces
and for the protection of networks and infrastructures, mainly for a
government/defence customer base.

In order to monitor the operating and financial performance of the Group
entities, the Group's executives regularly consider certain key non-GAAP
indicators as defined in Note 13-a, which enable them to exclude certain
non-operating and non-recurring items.

In particular, EBIT, presented by business segment below, corresponds to
income from operations plus the share in net income of equity affiliates,
excluding amortisation of acquisiton-related intangible assets (purchase
price allocation — PPA) reported under business combinations. It also

excludes other expenses booked to income from operations that are
directly linked to business combinations, which are unusual by nature.

NOTE 3. IMPACT OF CHANGES IN SCOPE

OF CONSOLIDATION

3.1 Main changes in scope

of consolidation

In 2017:

In September 2017, Thales finalised the acquisition of the US company
Guavus, one of the pioneers of real-time “big data" analytics, for a
maximum enterprise value of $215 million, subject to the achievement
of significant sales growth targets. The net cash outflow reached
$109.1 million (€90.5 million) at the closing date. The purchase price
was allocated to amortisable intangible assets in the amount of
$84.2 million (mainly technology acquired) and a deferred tax liability
of $32 million. Residual goodwill amounted to $72.2 million (E60 million).
The Company is fully consolidated

In December 2017, Thales signed an agreement with the aim of
acquiring Gemalto and creating a world leader in digital security. The
offer, priced at €51 per share cum dividend {i.e. a total equity value of
approximately €4.8bn)} is subject to customary regulatory approvals. It
is expected to be completed in the second half of 2018

In 2016:
At the end of March 2016, Thales finalised the acquisition of Vormetric, a

leading provider of data protection solutions for a total of $408 million
(€372.4 million). Vormetric has been consolidated since its acquisition.

As part of the transaction, Thales signed compensation agreements with
key managers subject to their remaining with the company until 2020.
The related amounts are being taken to income on a straight-line basis
in tranches over the vesting period. These amounts are recognised in
income from operations, but excluded from EBIT as they concern an
event that is unusual nature (Note 2.1)

At the end of June 2016, Thales acquired Raytheon’s non-controlling
interest in French company TRS SAS and sold its stake in US company
TRS LIC to Raytheon for a net gain of $90 million {€81 million) in Thales’
consolidated financial statements.

In Thales’ consolidated financial statements, the acquisition of Raytheon’s
non-controlling interest in TRS SAS led to a reclassification in equity.
The disposal of the interest in TRS LLC resulted in a disposal gain of
€91.8 million. Thales-Raytheon Systems Air and Missile Defense
Command remains jointly owned by the Group and is accounted for under
the equity method

In October 2016, Thales sold its interest in Hanwha Thales, a
jointly-owned company that specialises in defence electronics in Korea,
for €204.4 million. The disposal gain recognised in the consolidated
financial statements amounted to €113.8 million

b) Impairment tests The assumptions used concern growsh in sales and terminal values and
are based on reasonable estimations in line with specific data available
for each business sector (generally, terminal value is bosed on the
average income from operations over the three years of the strategic plan,

with growth capped at 2%}

Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the
Group's budgetary timetable. Value in use is determined on the basis of
discounted future operating cash flows over a three-year period and a
terminal value. This calculation is based on data from the strategic plans
prepared in accordance with Group procedures. In certain specific
cases [recent acquisitions, non-typical annual results, etc.), the terminal
value is determined based on forecasts over an appropriate period of time.

At end-2017, the overall value in use of the group CGUs was higher
than its carrying amount.

c) Sensitivity of values in use
At end-2017 and end-2016, impairment tests were performed with the

initial assumption of a 8.5% discount rate for all CGUs (each of which
presented a similar degree of risk given that the specific CGU tisks are
factored into forecasts)

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

The Group also tests the sensitivty of values in use based on reasonable
key assumptions. At the end of 2017, a 1% increase in the discount rate, a
1% decrease in the growth rate or a 2% decrease in operating profitability
of the group CGUs would not require any additional impairments.

Receivables, payables and refundable grants are financial assets and
liabilities within the meaning of IAS 32/39 and are measured at
amottised cost. They are detailed in the Note 10.1

IFRS 13 categorises valuation techniques for each financial asset and
liability according to a fair value hierarchy with three levels:

e level 1: valuation is based on quoted (non adjusted) prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities;

level 2: valuation is based on information other than quoted market
prices that is observable for the asset or iabily, either direcly or indirectly;

e level 3: valuation is based on unobservable information for an asset

or liability

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost
approximates their carrying amount, except for borrowings and debs.

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

The fair value of bond debt is based on quoted prices [level 1). The fair
value of other borrowings and debt is determined for each loan by
discounting the expected future cash flows at the Euribor interest rate at
the closing date, adjusted for the Group's credit risk (level 2)

The fair value of monetary and non-monetary UCITS is measured
based on the last known net asset value. The fair value of interest rate
products (certificates of deposit, short-term deposits, negotiable
medium-term notes, etc.) is based on the discounting of coupons flows
(nominal and interest) over the remaining life of the product at the
closing date. The discount rate used is the market rate corresponding to
the maturity and product characteristics.

The fair value of derivatives is based on models commonly used to
measure these financial instruments (models including observable market
data). Counterparty defaut risk and credit risk have no material impact
on the fair value of derivatives.

6.6 Financial risk

Thales’ financial risk management policy is described in detail in the Group management report (chapter | of the 2017 Registration Document, see
Section 1.1.2).

a) Market risk

Thales hedges its foreign exchange and interest-rate risk using over-the-counter derivatives from tier-one banks. The book value of derivatives used to
manage the Group's market risk is presented below:

Foreign exchange risk

Thales hedges currency risks arising in connection with the negotiation of contracts denominated in currencies other than the main production
currency, currency risks generated by ordinary commercial operations, risks relating to cash pooling and, in some cases, risks relating to its net
investments in foreign operations

Interest-rate risk

The change in value of derivative instruments matched with commercial
tender portfolio, which are not eligible for hedge accounting, is
recognised in profit and loss.

Thales is exposed to interest-rate volatility and in particular its impact on the conditions associated with variable-rate financing. To limit this risk,
Thales operates an active interest-rate hedging policy. At 31 December 2016 and 2017, the amount of derivatives in the portfolio was as follows:

b) Customer credit risk

Credit risk relates to the risk that a party to a contract will default on its
commitments or fail to pay what it owes.

Risk of default by private sector customers

Non-governmental customers (aircraft manufacturers, airlines, private
infrastructure operators and industry) account for approximately 25% of
Thales’ sales. These customers may encounter major and/or prolonged
financial difficulties that could lead to payment defaults or order cancellations.
Such occurrences could have a negative impact on Thales’ sales, profitability
and financial position

To mitigate these risks, Thales conducts regular analyses of the ability of
customers to meet their obligations. When necessary, Thales may request
bank guarantees or corporate guarantees, or may use credit insurers.

Consolidated financial statements — 2017 Financial Information

Credit risk relating to public sector customers

Public, government and institutional customers account for around 75%
of Thales’ sales. Thales works with a large number of countries. Some
of them could present a significant credit risk which could, for example,
lead them to suspend an order in production, or render them unable to
pay on delivery, as agreed under the terms of the contract. To limit its
exposure to these risks, Thales takes out insurance with export credit
agencies (such as BPIFrance] or private insurers

At 31 December 2017, only three customers accounted for annual sales
in excess of €500 million: the French State (around €2.8 billion), the UK
government [around €1 billion) and the Australian government (around
€0,7 billion). At 31 December 2017, these three countries had first-class
or high-quality ratings (France: AA by S&P Global Ratings and Aa2 by
Moody's, the United Kingdom: AA by S&P Global Ratings and Aa2 by
Moody's, - Australia: ANA by S&P Global Ratings and Aaa by Moody's)

The Group's Finance department consolidates all the information relating to the Group's exposure to credit risk, notably by identifying and analysing
the ageing of overdue accounts and notes receivable that have not been impaired. At 31 December 2017 and 2016, the ageing of these accounts

and notes receivable is as follows:

31/12/2017 Total ‘Accounts and notes receivables past due
Less than 3 to 6 months More than

Credit risk related to banking counterparties
Financial investments are diversified. They relate to first ranking debt and
are negotiated with tier-one banks

Thales Group trades over-the-counter derivatives with tier-one banks
under agreements which provide for the offseting of amounts payable

and receivable in the event of default by one of the contracting parties.
These conditional offsetting agreements do not meet the eligibility
criteria within the meaning of IAS 32 for offsetting derivative instruments
recorded under assets and liabilities. However, they do fall within the
scope of disclosures under IFRS 7 on offsetting

¢) Liquidity risk

The Group's liquidity risk is the risk of it being unable to meet its cash
needs out of its financial resources. In particular, it relates to Thales’
level of exposure to changes in the main market indicators that could
lead to an increase in the cost of credit or even fo a temporary limitation
of access to external sources of financing.

The Group manages this risk by trying to anticipate its cash needs and
ensures that these are covered by the Group's short-term and long-term
financial resources, as follows

e shareholders’ equity (Note 8.1);
¢ gross debt (listed by date of maturity in Note 6.2);

¢ committed, undrawn credit facilities granted by banks amounted to
€1,500 million with maturing in 2021 as backup to the commercial
paper programme and acting as a financing reserve.

At 31 December 2017, the Group also had an undrawn bridge loan to
finance its proposed offer for the acquisition of Gemalto.

NOTE 7. INCOME TAX

The parent company’s financing programmes are rated by S&P Global
Rating and Moody's. At the date of publication, Thales’ credit risk
ratings were as follows

Moody's S&P Global

Ratings

Medium and long-term loans AQ A
Outlook Negative Negative
watch

Commercial paper and short-term loans Prime-1 A2

Moody's and S&P Global ratings downgraded their outlook {from
"stable" to “negative” and “negative watch" respectively] following the
announcement on 17 December 2017 of the planned cash tender offer
for Gemalto. If this acquisition, partly financed from the Group's own
cash flow and partly through borrowings, goes ahead, it would in all
likelihood cause Thales’s rating to be lowered, due mainly to the
change in the Group's financing structure.

The decrease of Thales’ credit risk rating would not trigger the financial
covenants included in its financing contracts. The single accelerated
repayment clause would apply only in the event that the French State
ceased to hold its golden share and, simultaneously, the ratio of
consolidated net debt to EBITDA" were to exceed 3x.

A lower rating would result in an increase (capped) in the margins
applicable to the €1.5 billion committedcredit facility. A higher rating
would lead to a decrease in the applicable margin (with a minimum
threshold). No other financing arrangements are subject to covenants
based on financial ratios.

The income tax charge takes into account specific local tax rules, including the tax consolidation systems in France and the United States, group

The theoretical average rate corresponds to the sum of theoretical taxes
of consolidated companies, divided by the consolidated net income
before tax and the share in net income of equity affiliates. The
theoretical tax of each consolidated company corresponds to the
application of the local tax rate to net income before tax. Accordingly,
the theoretical average tax rate reflects the relative contribution of the
different countries to consolidated net income. France, which has a tax
rate of 34.43%, represented almost 70% of income before tax in both
2016 and 2017

The impact of tax credits includes:

the impact of tax exemption on research tax credits (€176 million in
2017, €176.2 million in 2016) and tax credits for competitiveness
and jobs (crédit dimpét pour la compétitivité et l'emploi — CICE)
recognised in operating income;

e the tax advantages related to research, which are recognised in
income tax {notably in United States, Australia and the Netherlands}

Taxes not taken into account in the theoretical rate mainly include state
taxes in the United States, IRAP in Italy, taxes on foreign establishments,
and the additional contribution in France in 2017 (a negative amount of
€50.3 million)

In 2016, the impact of dividends paid mainly included the 3% tox
introduced in France at the end of 2012 (a negative amount of
€12.9 million). This tax, deemed unconstitutional, was repaid by the
French government at the end of 2017 (net impact in 2017 of €48.5 million
covering financial years 2013-2017]

The impact of changes in deferred tax rates mainly includes
ein 2016, the impact of the decrease in tax rate enacted in France

with effect from 2020 (to 28.92% from 34.43%);

ein 2017, the impact of the new gradual decrease in tax rate in
France (a negative amount of €7.7 million) and the impact of the
reduction in the federal tax rate in the USA from 35% to 21% (a
negative amount of €22.0 million)

9.3 Pensions and other
employee benefits
The Group grants its employees post-employment benefits (pensions,

end-of-career indemnities, medical care, etc.) and other long-term benefits
llong-service and jubilee awards, etc.)

a) Description of the plans

The Group's existing plans are either defined contribution plans or

defined benefit plans

Defined contribution plans

In certain countries, the Group pays contributions based on salaries to
state organisations in charge of basic pension schemes [e.g., Sécurité
Sociale or compulsory supplementary schemes ARRCO and AGIRC in
France). Beyond these basic pension schemes, Thales also contributes
to other defined contribution plans (e.g., Netherlands and United Kingdom

66 THALES — 2017 Registration Document

since 2002). These plans do not impose any other obligations on the
Group except for the payment of contributions: there is no related benefit
obligation and conitibutions are expensed in the period they are incurred.

Defined benefit plans
Defined benefit plans relate to different types of advantages

pensions and end-of-career indemnities {legal or contractual), and other
long-term benefits (jubiliee awards, etc.), notably in France. In general,
these commitments are not covered by any assets;

supplementary pension schemes, mainly in the United Kingdom
where the main scheme, “Thales UK Pension Scheme” provides a
pension based on the beneficiary's average salary, indexed to
inflation. This plan has been closed to new entrants since 2002, and
is managed by a trust according to minimum local funding regulations.

The present value of the Group's obligations and the value of plan assets
are measured independantly. A provision is recognised if the value of
the assets is insufficient to cover the obligations.

d) Actuarial assumptions used

The actuarial assumptions used are determined according to the economic environment and specific criteria of each country and each system. The

most sensitive assumptions are as follows:

2017 UK France 2016 UK France
Inflation rate 3.19% 1.35% Inflation rate 3.22% 1.40%
Discount rate 2.60% 1.20% Discount rate 2.7% 1.50%
Average duration of the plans 17 years 10 years Average duration of the plans 17 years 10 years

For each country, the discount rates are obtained by reference to the Iboxx Corporate AA index which reflects the rate of return of very high-quality
corporate bonds, with maturity dates equivalent to the duration of the plans being measured, and in the same currency.

At 31 December 2017, the sensitivity of the net obligation to a change in the discount rate is as follows:

Sensitivity in basis points +0.25%

0.25%

+0.50% -0.50% +1% 1%

249.6

Dectease (increase) in provision (in € millions)

(265.6)

483.7 (548.7) 910.5 (1,172.9)

In the United Kingdom, a 25-basis-point increase in the inflation rate would lead to a €117.1

million increase in the obligation. Conversely,

25-basis-point decrease in the inflation rate would give rise to a €135.5 million decrease in the obligation.

e) Allocation and return on plan assets

Plan assets generated an actual average return of 5.5% in 2017,
compared with 14% in 2016. At 31 December 2017, the allocation of
assets, mainly invested in the United Kingdom, breaks down as follows

2017 2016
Fixed-rate bonds 34% 32%
Index-linked investments 12% 13%
Equities 28% 33%
Alternative liquid investments 10% 8%
Alternative non-liquid
investments (property, etc.) 16% 14%
TOTAL 100% 100%

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

f) Funding

Thales is subject to funding obligations in respect of its defined benefit
pension commitments in the United Kingdom.

In accordance with the regulations in force, the level of funding for its
pension obligation is remeasured every three years, further to which the
suitability of a new funding plan and/or the implementation of guarantees
for the plan is decided in consultation with the trustees. The latest measurement,
based on the situation at end-2014, was finalised in September 2016
and led to an annual contribution of £60 million to the main Thales UK
Pension Scheme (£5 million for other schemes}

Depending on changes in the degree of deficit which will be determined
based on the situation at the end of 2017, future contributions to the main
scheme could change from 2018 and increase to £75 milion

f) Employee share purchase plan

Following the decision of the Board of Directors on 27 February 2017,
the Group implemented a Thales share purchase plan reserved to its
employees with a discount compared to the average market price plus
an employer contribution

The subscription price of €75.93, set on 12 October 2017, corresponds
to the average of the opening price of Thales shares on Euronext Paris
over the twenty trading days preceding this date, discounted by 20%.

The employees also received an employer contribution corresponding
to one free share for four acquired shares up to 40 shares purchased,
within the limit of 10 matching shares.

This plan is part of the Group savings plan, subject to a five-year lockup
period of the investment, except for the United Kingdom where the share
offering is implemented in accordance with the Share Incentive Plan ("SIP")

Thus, in 2017, 377,989 shares were subscribed by employees at the
subscription price of €75.93 and 84,178 bonus shares were received
The delivery of shares to UK based employees will be finalised in
early 2018

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

In the consolidated financial statements, the cost of this plan is measured
according to the French CNC (Conseil National de la Comptabilité)
recommendation, taking the five-year lock-up period into account.
This approach measures the share according to a replication strategy in
which the market participant would sell the share at the end of the
five-year lockup period and would borrow the necessary amount to
immediately buy a free share by financing the loan by the future sale
and dividends paid out during the lock-up period

Accounting cost: hypothesis taken

Five-year free risk interest rate 0.18%
Spread of the banking system (retail) 5.00%
Financing rate for an employee 5.18%
Cost of security loan (repo) 1.0%
Cost for the Group (M€} €6.0 Mb

NOTE 10. CURRENT OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Current operating assets and liabilities include working capital
components and reserves for contingencies. The changes in these items
are presented below.

Contracts falling within the scope of IAS 11 are subject to specific
classification in the consolidated balance sheet: for each contract, the
balance of unbilled receivables, work in progress and reserves for
contingencies are presented in assets or liabilities under “Construction
contracts” (Note 13-c}

The Group is authorised to assign trade receivables, mainly from
the French State, and commercial paper. At 31 December 2017,

derecognised receivables amounted to €292.5million (€143.5 million
at 31 December 2016). The organic change in derecognised receivables
tepresenis an increase of €149 million for 2017 (a decrease of €39.7 milion
in 2016]

As these assignements without recourse in case of default by the debtor
involve the transfer of substantially all corresponding risks and rewards,
they are derecognised. Thales’ continued involvement (within the meaning
of IFRS 7) in the related risks and rewards corresponds to the share of
dilution risk not transferred to the bank and the remuneration received
under the recovery mandate.

[a] In 2017, additions to provisions for bad debts, net of reversals of surplus provision, amounted to €6.5 million ({€2.1 million in 2016).

10.4 Bonds and warranties
linked to commercial
contracts

In the ordinary course of its activities, the Group regularly responds to
invitations to tender. When requested by the customer, bid bonds are
delivered in order to demonstrate the definitive nature of the bid and
to indemnify the customer if the Group fails to meet its commitments.
At 31 December 2017, bid bonds issued amounted to €33.6 million
(€26.2 million at 31 December 2016)

From the signature of a contract up until its completion, the Group may
also issue performance bonds for its customers, with a bank acting as an

intermediary, in order to cover the payment of damages to the customer
in the event that the Group does not meet its contractual commitments.
At 31 December 2017, performance bonds amounted to €1,812.5 million
(€2,288.6 million at 31 December 2016}

Technical, operational and financial costs incurred by the Group in
order to meet its obligations are valued, on a contract-by-contract
basis, and are included in the cost to completion of the contract. Where
this is not the case, a provision is set aside in the consolidated financial
statements for any potential risk, estimated on a contract-by-contract basis.

In order to finance contract execution, the Group may receive advance
payments from its customers, in accordance with contractual terms, which
are recognised in liabilities in the balance sheet. In order to guarantee
reimbursement of these advance payments if the contractual obligations

2017 Registration Document — THALES

2017 Financial Information — Consolidated financial statements

are not met, the Group may deliver, at the customer's request, an
advance payment bond. At 31 December 2017, advance payment bonds
amounted to €2,143.2million (€2,336.7 million at 31 December 2016}

The Group evaluates and sets aside provisions for warranty costs in
order to guarantee the conformity of goods sold fo the customer during

The maturity dates of these commitments are:

the contractual warranty period. In most cases, the provisional
withholding of payment contractually applying during this period can
be replaced by a warranty retention bond using a bank as intermediary.
At 31 December 2017, warranty retention bonds amount to €90.4million

The awarding of major contracts, particularly within the defence sector,
may be subject to local or regulatory offsetting obligations, which can
take the form of direct offsetting, semi-direct offsetting or indirect
offsetting. The associated risks are described under “tisk factors” in the
management report.

NOTE 11. LITIGATION

Due to the nature of its business activities, Thales is exposed to the risk
of technical and commercial litigation

To prevent disputes or limit their impact, Thales’ policy is to systematically
seek alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This policy is reviewed
‘on a regular basis to take into account changes in the Group's core
areas of business and is backed by employee training programmes.

In addition, Thales implemented a procedure several years ago to
centralise all civil commercial and criminal litigation and claims. These
are handled by the Corporate legal Affairs department, with the
support of the Group companies involved

In October 2017, Thales was noified of an arbitration award in o commercial
dispute between the Republic of China and a group of three French
manufactures, including Thales Systemes Aéroponiés, a Thales subsidy.

Parent company guarantees

In addition, Thales may grant parent company guarantees to third
parties on behalf of its subsidiaries without using a bank as an
intermediary. At 31 December 2017, these guarantees amounted to
€12,760.Amillion (€13,697.1 million at 31 December 2016)

These guarantees include all commitments given on behalf of Thales
Alenia Space, which are backed by a counterguarantee from Leonardo
in proportion to its interest in the capital of Thales Alenia Space (33%),

As a result of this arbitration award, which pertains to a contract signed
in 1992, the manufacturers were ordered to pay a total sum of
€227 million including interest, of which €64 million was payable by
Thales Systémes Aéroportés. The corresponding charge was recognised
under "Disposal of assets, changes in scope of consolidation and other”
in the financial statements as at 31 December 2017 (see Note 3.2)

There are no other government, judicial or arbitration claims of which
the Group is aware, which are pending or threatened and which could
have or have had, any significant effect on the financial position or
profitability of the Company and/or the Group in the last 12 months

NOTE 12. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

To the best of the Group's knowledge, no significant events occurred after the end of the reporting period

Consolidated financial statements — 2017 Financial Information

NOTE 13. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

a) Presentation of the financial statements

Consolidated profit and loss account
Expenses in the income statement are presented analytically by destination.

Income from operations is equal to income of operating activities before
taking into account:

© gains and losses on disposal of disposals of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets, businesses or investments;

the impact of changes in scope on consolidated net income (Note 13-b};

the impact of the amendment, curtailment or liquidation of pension plans
and other long-term benefits;

the impairment of non-current operating assets;

other operating income [expense] resulting from events that are unusual
by their frequency, nature and amount.

Consolidated balance sheet

A significant portion of the Group's activities in its different business
segments have long-term operating cycles. Accordingly, assets liabilities)
that are usually realised (settled) within the entities’ operating cycles
inventory, accounts receivable and payable, advances, reserves, etc.)
are classified in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets and
liabilities, with no distinction between the amounts due within one year
and those due after one year

Consolidated statement of cash flows

The statement of cash flows provides an analysis of the change in cash
and cash equivalents, as presented in the balance sheet and defined in
Note 13-h. The statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect
method based on consolidated net income and is broken down into
three categories:

net cash flow from operating activities (including interest and taxes};

e net cash flow used in investing activities, including net operating
investments (acquisition and disposal of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets, capitalisation of development
costs) and net financial investments;

«net cash flow used in financing activities including dividends paid,
from capital subscriptions (exercise of options by employees}, the
purchase/sale of treasury shares, the issuance and repayment of
debt, and changes in bank overdrafts, etc.

The Group also presents the changes in its net cash, which is a non-GAAP
measure and includes gross debt, net of cash and cash equivalents and
liquid investments. Changes in net cash, presented in Note 6.4,
notably reflect Free operating cash flow, defined as net cash flow from
operating activites less net operating investments, plus the payment of
the UK pension deficits.

Adjusted net income

In order to monitor and compare its operating and financial performances,
the Group presents the following key indicators:

EBIT, corresponding to income from operations plus the share in net
income of equity affiliates minus the amortisation of acquired intangible
assets (purchase price allocation — PPA) recorded when significant
businesses are combined. From | January 2016, it also excludes the
other expenses recognised in current operationnal result that are directly
related to business combinations, and which are unusual by nature.

Adjusted net income is regarded as pertinent by the Group as it excludes
non-recurring items. It corresponds to consolidated net income attributable
to shareholders of the parent company, less the following items, net of
the corresponding tax impacts:

© amortisation of acquired intangible assets (PPA);

other expenses recognised in current operational result that are directly
related to business combinations, and which are unusual by nature;

disposal of assets, changes in scope of consolidation and other:

changes in the fair value of derivative foreign exchange instruments,
recognised in “Other financial income”;

© actuarial gains and losses on long-term employee benefits, included
in ‘financial income on pensions and other employee benefits’

Adjusted net income per share corresponds to the adjusted net
income attributable to shareholders of the parent company, divided by the
average number of shares outstanding during the period concerned

Off-balance sheet commitments

Disclosures regarding off-balance sheet commitments are presented in
the following notes:

e Note 4.3: lease commitments;
¢ Note 9.3-f: funding obligations in respect of pensions;
© Note 10.4: commercial contract commitments.

Related parties

The Group has identified the following related parties: shareholders of
Thales SA (parent company), notably the French State and Dassault
Aviation, companies controlled by these shareholders, companies under
joint control or significant influence, Directors and Senior Corporate Officers.

Section 4.3.3.3 of the 2017 Registration Document describes the main
provisions concerning the shareholders’ agreement governing relations
between the French State (“public sector") and Dassault Aviation ("Industrial
Pariner"} within Thales, the convention on the protection of national strategic
interests and the specific convention binding the State and Thales

Information related to transactions with related parties is presented in the
following notes:

e sales with the French State [mainly with DGA: French defence
procurement agency) in Note 6;

transactions with companies under joint control and their joint shareholders
in Note 5.1-e

Transactions with other related parties are not material

Expenses recognised in respect of compensation, benefits and social
security contributions attributable to Directors and members of the Executive
Committee are presented in Note 9.5

b) Scope of consolidation and changes in scope

Scope of consolidation

The financial statements of material subsidiaries directly or indirectly
controlled by Thales are fully consolidated. The financial statements of
material subsidiaries jointly controlled by Thales joint Ventures) or in
which the Group has significant influence (associates) are accounted for

under the equity method
The main consolidated companies are listed in Note 16

The full list of affiliates outside of France is available on the Group's website
(hitps://www.thalesgroup.com/en/corporate-responsibility#documents)

Business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method
as described in IFRS 3. Under this method, the Group recognises identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value on their acquisition
date. It also recognises non-controlling interests in an acquiree on their
acquisition date

2017 Registration Document — THALES

75

76

information — Consolidated financial statements

Non-conitrolling interests are measured either at fair value or proportionate
to the share of the identifiable net assets. This is determined on a
case-by-case by the Group depending on the option it wishes to apply.

Acquisition-related costs (valuation fees, consulting fees, etc.) are
recognised under “other operating expenses” as incurred

Negative goodwill is immediately recognised in “other operating
income (expenses]”. Positive goodwill related to controlled companies
is recognised in balance sheet assets under intangible assets. Positive
goodwill related to equity affiliates is recognised under “share in net
assets of equity affiliates”

Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to impairment tests each year.
Goodwill impairment is booked as an expense under “impairment of
non-current operating assets” and may not be reversed. Goodwill
impairment related to equity affiliates is recognised in “share in net income
of equity affiliates’ and may be reversed

c) Revenue recognition

The Group's sales can be divided into two main accounting categories:
sales of goods and services, and construction contracts.

Sales are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable. When the deferral of payment has a material effect on the
determination of fair value, the amount at which sales are recognised is
adjusted to take the financial impact of the deferral of payment into account.

Sales of goods and services

Income from the sales of goods and services together with royalty and
licence income are recognised when future economic benefits are likely
to flow to the Group and when the amount of sales can be measured
reliably. The following specific criteria must also be satisfied in order for
sales to be recognised

@ income from the sale of goods is recognised when the Company
has transferred the principal risks and rewards inherent to ownership
of the goods to the purchaser;

* income from services rendered is recognised according to the
percentage-of-completion method

The costs related to the service provided (sale of goods or services
rendered) are recognised in the statement of income at the same time
as the corresponding sales

Construction contracts

A construction contract is a contract specifically negotiated for the
construction of an asset or group of assets that are closely linked or
interrelated in terms of their design, technology, function, purpose or use

According to its characteristics, a notified construction contract can
either be accounted for separately, be segmented into several components
which are each accounted for separately, or be combined with another
construction contract in progress in order to form the scope of the
contract for accounting purposes in respect of which sales and expenses
will be recognised

Sales and expenses on construction contracts are recognised in
accordance with the technical percentage-of-completion method
However, when there is no significant time difference between technical
percentage of completion and contractual dates of transfer of ownership,
the percentage of completion is determined according fo the contractual
transfer of ownership

Penalties for late payment or the improper execution of a contract are
recognised as a deduction from sales. In the balance sheet, provisions
for penalties are deducted from assets related to the contract.

Expected losses on contracts are fully recognised as soon as they are

identified.

Selling, administrative and interest expenses are directly charged to the
profit and loss account in the period in which they are incurred

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

Estimates of work remaining on loss-making contracts do not include
sales from claims made by the Group, except when it is highly
probable that such claims will be accepted by the customer.

Progress payments received on construction contracts are deducted
from contract assets as the contract is completed. Progress payments
received before the corresponding work has been performed are
classified in “advances received from customers on contracts" in
balance sheet liabilities:

The cumulative amount of costs incurred and profit recognised, less any
recognised losses and progress billings, is determined on a
contract-by-contract basis. If this amount is positive, it is recognised
under “Construction contracts: assets” in the balance sheet. If it is
negative, it is recognised under “Construction contracts: liabilities”

d) Inventories and work in progress

In the consolidated balance sheet, work in progress related to
construction contracts is included under “Construction contracts: assets”
or “Construction contracts: liabilities”

Inventories and work in progress are carried at their production cost
(determined using the FIFO or weighted-average cost method) and
written down when production cost exceeds their net realisable value.
Work in progress, semi-finished and finished goods are stated at dire
ct cost of raw materials, production labour and subcontractor costs
incurred during production, plus an appropriate portion of production
overheads and any other costs that can be directly allocated to
contracts

When material, the cost of debt incurred during the construction of a
qualifying asset is incorporated in the value of the asset. When the
funding is specific, the loan interest rate is used, otherwise the Group's
financing rate is used

e) Research and development expenses

A significant share of research and development expenses is funded by
customers and government agencies. Internally funded research and
development expenses are charged to the profit and loss account as
incurred, except for project development costs which meet the criteria
below. In this case, the development costs are capitalised in balance
sheet assets:

the product or process is clearly defined, and costs are separately
identified and reliably measured;

e the technical feasibility of the product or project is clearly
demonstrated, and the Group's experience in this area is established;

adequate resources are available to complete the project successfully;

a potential market for the products exists or their usefulness, in case
of internal use, is demonstrated;

e the Company intends to produce and market, or use the new
product or process, and can demonstrate its profitability. Profitability
is assessed on the basis of prudent commercial assumptions in order
to reflect contingencies inherent to the long cycles of the Group's
activities, in particular Aerospace. Minimum internal rates of return
ate required in the case of projects deemed risky.

Capitalised development costs mainly relate to the Group's Aerospace
and Security activities, for which the products developed are relatively
generic and can be sold to a larger number of potential customers.
By contrast, development costs linked to Defence activities are for more
specific and restricted markets with a more limited number of players: the
specific features of the products developed make it harder to share
development work and therefore harder to capitalise the associated costs.

Development costs are then amortised over the useful life of the product.
The method of amortisation is generally determined by reference to
expected future quantities over the period in which future economic
benefits will be earned. If the method cannot be determined reliably,
linear amortisation is adopted. The period of amortisation depends on
the type of activity.


--- Page 70 ---

Assets are also subjected to impairment loss tests. The terms and
assumptions taken into account to conduct these tests are described in
Note 4. These impairment losses can be reversed. Impairment loss
reversal criteria are identical to those retained when first capitalising
development costs on a new project.

The Group receives tax credits related to research carried out by its
subsidiaries. These tax credits are considered as operating grants and
are therefore included in income from operations, when their award is
not dependent on the generation of taxable income. Otherwise, they
are recognised as a deduction from income tax expense.

f) Restructuring costs

Provisions for restructuring costs are set aside when restructuring programs
have been agreed and approved by Group management and have
been announced before the balance sheet date, resulting in an obligating
event of the Group to the third parties in question, as long as the Group
does not expect consideration for these costs

Such costs primarily relate to severance payments, costs for notice
periods not worked and other costs linked to the closure of facilities
such as write-offs of fixed assets. These costs and the costs directly
linked to restructuring measures (removal costs, training costs of transferred
employees, etc.) are recognised under “restructuring costs" in the profit
and loss account.

9) Property, plant and equipment
an

intangible assets

The Group’ intangible assets mainly include
goodwill [Note 13-b};

¢ assets acquired in business combinations, primarily acquired
technologies, customer relationships and the order backlog. These
assets are recognised at fair value and amortised over their useful
lives. The fair value of the assets is based on the market value. If no
active market exists, the Group uses methods based on forecasts of
the present value of the expected future operating cash flows (excess
earings method, royalty method, etc.);

capitalised development costs (Note 13-e).

Intangible assets are submitted to impairment tests.

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of any accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation of
property, plant and equipment is generally calculated on the basis
of the following typical useful lives

© 20 years for buildings;

¢ 110 10 years for technical facilities and industrial equipment and tooling;

e 5 to 10 years for other property, plant and equipment (vehicles,
fixtures, etc.)

The depreciable amount takes into account the residual value of the
asset. The different components of property, plant and equipment are
recognised separately when their estimated useful lives or patterns of
use, and thus the period over which they are depreciated or the
depreciation methods applicable to them, are materially different.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction
of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

h) Financial assets,
and derivatives

Financial assets

Financial assets are initially recorded at fair value. They are subsequently
measured at either fair value or amortised cost, depending on the
category they fall into, as defined by IAS 39.

Consolidated financial statements — 2017 Financial Information

Investments are designated as “available for sale” assets and measured
at fair value. The fair value corresponds to the market price for
shares quoted on a regulated market. For other shares, the fair value
is usually determined using valuation models provided by independent
third parties, or by reference to the share in net equity held by the
Group. Changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity. F an
impairment indicator is identified, impairment is recognised in “other
financial income expense)". Such impairments are only written back
fo profit and loss at the date of disposal of the security in question.

e Receivables and financial loans are recognised at amortised cost.
They are subject to impairment if an impairment indicator is
identified. Such impairment, recognised in “other financial income
expense’, may subsequently be reversed through profit and loss if
the conditions which led to the impairment loss being recognised
cease to exist

¢ Deposits that Thales intends to hold until maturity are recognised at
amortised cost.

Other financial assets are estimated at fair value, with changes in
fair value recognised in profit and loss. They include money market
funds and other mutual funds, and interest rate products (certificates
of deposit, term deposits, medium-term negotiable notes, etc.)

© “Cash and cash equivalents” includes cash at bank and in hand as
well as cash equivalents [short-term and liquid investments that are
easily converted into a known amount of cash and exposed to
negligible risk of a change in value}

Financial liabilities

Borrowings and other financial liabilities are measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest rate. Upon initial recognition, premiums,
redemption and issuance costs are included in the calculation of the
effective interest rate and are recognised in the profit and loss account
‘on an actuarial basis over the life of the loan.

Derivatives

The Group uses financial instruments to manage and reduce its exposure
to risks of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates

Foreign exchange derivatives eligible for hedge accounting are
accounted for as follows

e the effective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging
instrument is recognised directly in equity until such time as the hedged
flows affect profit and loss. The ineffective portion is recognised in
profit and loss;

e the amount of the foreign currency denominated transaction is
subsequently translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date
of inception of the hedge

Changes in the fair value of premiums or discounts related to forward
foreign currency contracts, as well as the time value of foreign currency
options, are recognised in “other financial income {expense}” as they
are excluded from the hedging relationship.

Interestrate derivatives are used either as fair value hedges or cash
flow hedges:

© a fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in the
value of assets and liabiles;

a cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in the
value of future cash flows (unknown future interest flows payable on
existing variable-rate borrowings or on highly probable future
borrowing issues, for example)

In the case of fair value hedge relationships, particularly for the portion
of fixed-rate bond debt swapped for a variable rate, the financial
liabilities hedged by the interest-rate derivatives are remeasured to the
extent of risk hedged. Changes in the value of hedged items are
recognised in profit and loss for the period and are offset by symmetrical
adjustments in interest-rate derivatives

2017 Registration Document — THALES


--- Page 71 ---

2017 Financial Information — Consolidated financial statements

78

In the case of cash flow hedging relationships, the effective portion of
changes in fair value of interest-rate derivatives shown in the balance
sheet is recognised directly in equity until such time as the hedged flows
affect profit and loss.

i) Deferred taxation

Thales recognises deferred taxes when the tax value of an asset or

liability differs from its book value.

Deferred tax assets are not recognised in the balance sheet if the
company concerned does not reasonably expect to recover the tax
asset. To assess its ability to recover deferred tax assets, the Group
takes into account forecast taxable income of the tax entities concerned,
generally over a five-year time-frame, non-recurring past events and tax
strategies specific to each country.

j) Pensions and other long-term employee benefits

The Group's defined benefit plan commitments are measured by
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method on the
basis of estimated salaries at the date of retirement. The calculations
mainly take into account assumptions concerning discounting as well as
inflation, mortality and staff turnover rates, etc.

Changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments —
corresponding to the effects of differences between previous actuarial
assumptions and what has actually occurred — give rise to actuarial
gains and losses:

¢ actuarial gains and losses on post-employment benefits are
recognised in full within other comprehensive income, and are not
subsequently reclassfied to profit and loss. Where appropriate, the
same treatment is applied to adjustments linked to the ceiling on net
assets for plans in surplus;

actuarial gains and losses on other long-term benefits are recognised
immediately in financial income (Note 9.3).

Past service cost, measured in cases of amendments or curtailments
of plans, and plan setlements are recognised in full within non-recurring
‘operating income in the period in which it is incurred

Net interest expense, determined based on the discount rate of
obligations, is recognised in financial income.

k) Share-based payment

Free share plans

Between 2007 and 2013, and then again in 2016 and 2017, Thales
granted free shares and/or performance shares 10 its employees. These
allotments give rise to an expense representing the fair value of services
received at the grant date. This payroll expense is recognised against equity.

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

The fair value of the services received is calculated by reference to the
fair value of the shares at the grant date, less the present value of
dividends forfeited by employees during the vesting period, taking into
account the presence conditions

Internal performance conditions are taken into account only by means
of an adjustment in the projected number of instruments acquired by
employees at the end of the vesting period. Therefore, they are not
taken into account in the fair value estimate of the instruments granted,
which is determined at the grant date.

The expense related to these plans is included in the current operating
income with the consolidated reserves account as counterpart without
impact on total equity. As the payment of compensation is subject
to presence conditions, the corresponding expense is recorded over the
vesting period on a straight-line basis. When appropriate, the expense
is adjusted over the vesting period to reflect any losses of rights.

Share unit plans indexed
to the value of the Thales share

A share unit plan indexed to the value of Thales shares, some of which
are performance shares, was implemented in 2014 and in 2015
At the maturity date, the beneficiaries will receive the value, about half
of which is in the form of shares and half in the form of cash-settled
share-based payment,

The proportion delivered in shares follows the sarne accounting policies
as those applied to free share plans. The accounting treatment
applicable to cash-settled share-based payments is governed by
IFRS 2. Under this policy, the services acquired and the liability incurred
are measured at fair value. Until the liability is settled, debt is
remeasured at each reporting date, with any changes in fair value
recognised in income for the period. The remeasurement of the liability
at the reporting date takes into account any changes in the value of the
underlying shares, as well as whether or not the presence conditions
and performance criteria have been met.

Phantom shares

Since this is a cash-settled plan, IFRS 2 requires an evaluation of vested
services and the liability assumed at fair value. Until the payment of the
liability, the debt is remeasured at the closing date and taken to profit
and loss. The remeasurement of the debt takes into account the
achievernent of performance and/or presence conditions, as well as
the change in value of the underlying shares

Company savings plans

Employee share offerings with a discount to the market price proposed
within Company savings plans do not include any vesting period for
rights but are subject to a legal five-year lock-up period. The
measurement of the advantages granted to employees takes into
account the cost of the five-year lock-up period

To the Annual General Meeting of Thales,

Opinion
In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your annual

general meetings, we have audited the accompanying consolidated
financial statements of Thales for the year ended December 31, 2017.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair
view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the
Group as at December 31, 2017 and of the results of its operations for
the year then ended in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union

The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the
Audit and Accounts Committee.

THALES — Document de référence 2017

Justification of assessments - Key audit matters

In accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7
of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce] relating to the
justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters
relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated
financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed
those risks

Recognition of construction contracts

Consolidated financial statements — 2017 Financial Information

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific
items of the consolidated financial statements.

Risk identified

A significant part of the Group's revenue and current operating income
results from construction contracts accounted for using the
percentage-of-completion method. These contracts are offen spread
over several years

Thales determines the revenue and the expenses for construction
contracts under the conditions described in Note 13-c "Revenue" to the
consolidated financial statements.

The recognition of income and expenses relating to construction
contracts during an accounting closing primarily depends on:

estimates of the revenue and margin at completion, and notably the
level of provisions for technical and commercial risks;

technical milestones reached in the performance of the contracts.

For each contract, estimates of costs at completion, as well as the
achievement of technical milestones, are based on the Group's internal
systems and procedures, notably involving project managers. These
estimates are reviewed regularly by the managements of the Global
Business Units and the executive management, particularly at each
closing date

We considered the recognition of construction contracts to be a key

Our response
Our work notably consisted in

e evaluating the Group's systems and procedures for estimating
revenue and costs at completion and measuring technical
milestones;

reconciling the construction contract management data with the
accounting data;

selecting contracts that are significant due to their financial impact

and risk profile and interviewing the account managers, the

managements of the Global Business Units and the executive

management on the progress made on these contracts and their

assessment of the risks in order to:

- assess the reflection in the accounts of the contractual clauses;

= corroborate the main revenue’s and costs at completion’s
assumptions with the costs incurred to date, the contractual data,
and correspondence with the client or their representatives. These
procedures take into account the experience gained in previous
years on these contracts or on similar contracts;

= assess the consistency of the revenue recognized on the contract
and other items in the income statement and balance sheet in
relation to the milestones reached and to the contractual

. oe iti
audit matter, in view of the impact of these contracts on the conaions
consolidated financial statements of the Group and the level of
estimation required by the management to determine results upon
completion
Litigation
Risk identified Our response

The Group carries out its activities in France and abroad in legal and
regulatory environments that are complex and constantly evolving
Therefore, it is exposed to legal, technical and commercial risks

The Group's legal department centralizes and handles, with assistance
from the subsidiaries concerned, all civil, commercial and criminal
litigation and claims.

The assessment of these risks and litigation by the management has
resulted in the Group recording liabilities and provisions for impairment.
Note 11 “Litigation” to the consolidated financial statements describes
potential uncertainties relating to significant litigation and their progress

We considered the listing and evaluation of litigation and the
associated risks to be a key audit matter in view of the significance of
the estimates made by the management and the potential materiality of
their impact on the Group's income and shareholders’ equity, should
these estimates change.

With regard to technical and commercial litigation, our work notably
consisted in:

e Evaluated the procedures in force within the Group relating to the
listing, assessment and reflection in the accounts of civil, commercial
and criminal litigation and claims and assessing their correct
application via sampling;

interviewing the Finance department, the legal Department a Group
Secretary and General Council, as well as the managements of the
main consolidated entities, on the status of all significant litigation;

questioning the Group's main lawyers to confirm the listing of
litigation and assess the nature of the related risks and liabilities;

reading the meetings’ minutes of the Audit and Accounts Committee
and the Board of Directors in order to assess the completeness of the
list of significant litigation

Lastly, we considered whether the risks and significant litigation
identified during the implementation of these procedures are described
appropriately in Note 11 “Litigation” to the consolidated financial
statements.

Implementation of IFRS 15 relating to revenue recognition

Risk identified

IFRS 15, which will be mandatorily applicable for the year beginning
on January 1, 2018, introduces new criteria for the recognition of
revenue

As from the end of 2016, the Group set up a work group to identify
divergences with its current accounting methods. The Group measured
the accounting impacts by relying on analyses of the contractual or
general conditions applicable to its construction contracts and on a
simulation tool developed internally by the Group.

These differences and the expected impact relating to the Group's key
figures from January 1 to December 31, 2017 are presented in
Note 1.2 to the consolidated financial statements.

We considered the adoption of IFRS 15 relating to the recognition of
revenue to be a key audit matter, in view of the differences with the
existing principles and methods, notably including the transition from the
technical percentage of completion method to the percentage of
completion method expense based in order to recognize the revenue
from contracts which provide for criteria proving the transfer of control
over time.

Verification of the Information Pertaining to
the Group presented in the management report

As required by law and in accordance with professional standards
applicable in Francewe have also verified the information pertaining to
the Group presented in the Board of Directors's management report.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its
consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

Report on other legal and regulatory
requirements

¢ Appointment of the statutory auditors

We were appointed as statutory auditors of Thales by the ordinary and
extraordinary Annual General Meeting held on June 25, 1983 for
MAZARS and on May 15, 2003 for ERNST & YOUNG Audit.

As at December 31, 2017, MAZARS was in the 35th year and ERNST &
YOUNG Audit in the 15th year of total uninterrupted engagement.

Responsil ies of Management
and those charged with Governance
for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of
the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and
for such internal control as management determines is necessary to
enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is
responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going
concem, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected
to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.

The Audit and Accounts Committee is responsible for monitoring the
financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and
risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit,
regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.

The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of
Directors.

THALES — Document de référence 2017

Our response

Our work consisted in:

assessing the compliance of the new revenue recognition principles
and methods described in Note 1.2 to the consolidated financial
statements with IFRS 15;

verifying of the quantified impacts presented in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements concerning the adoption of
IFRS 15 on shareholders’ equity and the order book as at January 1,
2017, as well as on revenue and 2017 profit. For this purpose, we:
= selected contracts on the basis of their financial impact and risk
profile;
= assessed the Group's analyses of these contracts, which allowed
it to decide on the transfer of control over time or point in time
and, where applicable, the identification of the various
performance obligations. We evaluated the contractual
conditions for termination for convenience, legal memos and
margin simulations performed by the Group;
- Evaluated the functioning of the simulation tool developed
internally and reconciled the data used in the tool and in the
analyses done by the main subsidiaries with the accounting data

Lastly, we assessed the appropriateness of the qualitative and
quantitative information given in Note 1.2 to the consolidated financial
statements.

Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the
Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

e Objectives and audit approach

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements.
Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these consolidated financial statements

As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code
(Code de commerce}, our statutory audit does not include assurance on
the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs
of the Company.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional
standards applicable in France, the statutory auditors exercise
professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:

e Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on
the effectiveness of the internal control

e Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures
made by management in the consolidated financial statements.

e Assess the appropriateness of management's use of the going
concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence


--- Page 76 ---

obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability
to continue as a going concer. This assessment is based on the
audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However,
future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to
continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a
material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in
the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or
inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein

Evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements and assesses whether these statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial
information of the entities or business activities within the Group to
express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The
statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements
and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial
statements.

Consolidated financial statements — 2017 Financial Information

e Report to the Audit and Accounts Committee

We submit a report to the Audit and Accounts Committee which
includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the
audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also
report significant deficiencies, if any, in internal control regarding the
accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified

Our report to the Audit and Accounts Committee includes the risks of
material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the
current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are
required to describe in this report.

We also provide the Audit and Accounts Committee with the
declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014,
confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules
applicable in France as set out in particular in Articles L. 822-10 to
L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and
in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory
auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Accounts
Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
independence, and the related safeguards.

1.3.1.5 Proposed allocations of earnings and dividend policy

The Annual General Meeting, deliberating under the quorum and
majority conditions required for annual general meetings, noted" that
distributable earnings include:

Plus interim dividend in the amount of
€0.45 per share paid on 8 December 2017

and deducted from retained earnings €95,195,572.65

€2,084,562,162.60

For a total amount of

The Annual General Meeting decided!" to allocate this amount as follows:

Distribution of a dividend of €1.75 per share

on 212,658,725 shares bearing rights as from
January 2017 (including the interim dividend

of €0.45 per share paid on 8 December 2017
charged to the 2017 dividend, for a total amount

The sums corresponding to the dividends which, in accordance with the
provisions of the fourth paragraph of Article L. 225-210 of the French
Cornmercial Code, have not been paid on treasury shares held by the
Company, will be reallocated as retained earnings

In accordance with Article 243 bis of the French Tax Code, the entire
declared dividend {interim and remaining dividend amount} qualifies for
the 40% tax relief for individual taxpayers whose tax residence is in
France, as provided for in Article 158-3 2° of the French Tax Code. As
it relates to the remaining dividend amount, the tax relief is only
applicable where an express, irrevocable and general election has be
made for assessment according to the progressive scale for income tax.
Where such election has not been made, the remaining dividend
amount due to such individual taxpayers whose tax residence is in
France will be subject to the flat rate tax (prélévement forfaitaire unique

NOTE 6. INCOME TAX

General framework
and accounting principles

6.1

Since 1 January 1992, Thales has opted for the Group tax
consolidation regime. Thales is the head of a tax consolidation group
that includes the majority of its French subsidiaries pursuant to the tax
regime provided for by Ariicle 223A of the French Tax Code

In accordance with the tax consolidation agreement entered into
between Thales and its subsidiaries, each subsidiary in the tax group
records the amount of tax it would have paid had they been taxed
separately. Any tax savings arising on the use of tax losses of
subsidiaries are recorded by the parent company and recognised in the
income statement. However, the parent company may have to record a
corresponding tax expense, if and when these subsidiaries return to
profit and are able to deduct the losses as they would have done had
they been taxed separately.

6.2 Current tax

The income tax benefit breaks down as follows:

The corporate income tax rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was
34.43%, including the social contribution on profits. Tax loss
carryforwards are attributable up to the limit of 50% of taxable profit in
excess of €] million

In addition, the amended 2012 Finance Act had introduced a 3% tax
on dividends paid. By a decision published on 6 October 2017, the
French Constitutional Council overturned this tax entirely. In
December 2017, Thales was reimbursed the full amount paid between
2013 and 2017, representing €41.9 million, including default interest
Against this backdrop, the amended Finance Act introduced an
exceptional tax for 2017, taking the corporate tax rate for Thales from
34.43% to 44.43%. The corresponding expense amounts to
€45.2 million. These amounts were deducted from/reimbursed to
subsidiaries according to the existing tax consolidation agreement.

Thales also benefits from tax credits related to its research and
development activities at the Palaiseau site which are recorded against
income tax expense

Income tax benefit received from tax group subsidiaries 176.3 173.4

In 2017 as in 2016, no non-deductible general expenses were
reintegrated as a result of a tax audit. Expenditure excluded from
deductible expenses in accordance with Articles 223 quater and 39.4

6.3 Deferred tax

The Company has available future tax savings due to temporary
differences arising on the different tax and accounting treatments of
income and expenses (€143.3 million at 31 December 2017
compared with €128.0 million at 31 December 2016). These mainly
reflect provisions for contingencies and losses, in particular provisions

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

of the French Tax Code amounted to €0.2 million in both 2017 and
2016, reflecting excess amortisation of vehicles.

for post-employment benefits, which are not deductible for tax
purposes. There were no remaining tax loss carryforwards at
31 December 2017.

The corresponding deferred tax is not recognised

NOTE 8. EQUITY INVESTMENTS

8.1

Equity investments are recorded at cost price and related acquisition
costs are recognised in the income statement. In the event that the
inventory value exceeds the book value, a provision for impairment is
recorded for the difference.

Accounting principles

The inventory value is determined based on profitability forecasts, the
underlying assets, recent transactions or the market price of any listed
securities.

The profitability forecasts are determined on the basis of expected future
cash flows set out in the three-year strategic plans and a terminal value.

The assumptions used are prudent with forecast growth in sales and
terminal values limited to 2%.

The discount rate used is calculated on the basis of the Group's
weighted average cost of capital (8.5% in 2017 as in 2016), adjusted
if necessary for the specific risks attributable to each equity investment.
This rate is mainly based on the market risk-free rate, risk factors
inherent in the Group's businesses, the Group's marginal borrowing rate
and specific risks for which cash flows have not been adjusted.

Impairment tests are carried out annually at year-end in line with the Group's
internal schedule for the preparation of Group entity strategic plans

NOTE 14. TREASURY SHARES

14.1 Accounting principles .

Thales carries out transactions in its own shares in accordance with the
authorisations granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General
Meeting

At year-end, treasury shares are recognised and measured on the basis
of their assigned function

treasury shares that have not been assigned are recorded under
other financial investments at their acquisition cost. At the reporting
date, an impairment loss is recognised if their carrying value
exceeds the average stock market price for December;

14.2 Change in treasury shares

Change in the number of treasury shares

treasury shares assigned to a free share plan are recorded under
marketable securities, either at their acquisition cost if the shares were
assigned from the beginning of the plan, or at their net carrying value
at the reclassification date if they were assigned after their acquisition.

These treasury shares are not measured at market value because
they are set aside to be granted to employees. Accordingly:

= shares allocated to parent company (Thales) employees are
amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the plan
(48 months) through an increase in provisions for contingencies
and losses recorded in liabilities,

= shares allocated to other Group employees are maintained at
historical cost, as they will be re billed to the relevant subsidiaries
for the same amount.

At 31 December 2017, Thales held 568,739 treasury shares, including 126,000 shares (0.06% of share capital) that were freely transferable

NOTE 16. RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

16.1 Accounting principles

Payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies are
revalued at the closing price.

Thales (parent company] hedges currency risks related to contracts or
normal commercial transactions on behalf of its subsidiaries.

Until the end of 2016, the derivatives subscribed by Thales (parent
company) with banks and the foreign exchange guarantees granted to
subsidiaries were recorded at their market value in the balance sheet
under “Translation difference and exchange rate adjustments”

Following application of the new ANC Regulation 2015-05,
unrealised results on derivatives and foreign exchange guarantees are
maintained as off-balance sheet commitments.

Temporary cash offsets between the amounts received/paid to
subsidiaries and Thales's cash receipts/payments to banks with regard
to managing foreign exchange derivatives are recorded in the balance
sheet under “Translation difference and exchange rate adjustments”,
using the symmetry principle applicable to hedging transactions.

NOTE 17. PROVISIONS FOR CONTINGENCIES AND LOSSES

17.1 Accounting principles

The Group records a provision when it recognises a legal or
constructive obligation resulting from a past event for which an outflow
of resources will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of
the amount. Provisions are generally recorded for the following

Provisions for post-employment
and other employee benefits

The financing of post-employment benefits mainly involves statutory
retirement schemes (social security, supplementary schemes such as
ARRCO and AGIRC, etc.) for which the recognised expense is equal to
the contributions paid. These are recorded in the year in which they are
incurred

The Company grants its employees termination payments and other
long-term benefits (long-service awards and an additional week of
annual leave during the employee's 35th year of service within the Group)
Some senior executives also benefit from a supplementary pension plan

In accordance with ANC Regulation 2013-02, a provision is
recognised for obligations that qualify as defined benefit plans. It is
calculated on the basis of an actuarial valuation, determined using the
projected unit credit method and taking into account future salary levels
This method consists in assessing, for each employee, the present value
of the benefits that he or she can expect at the due date, by applying
assumptions concerning discount rates, inflation, mortality and staff turnover.

17.2 Breakdown of provisions

These plans are recognised in the Company's financial statements as follows:

the service cost, which corresponds to the increase in the obligation
during the reporting period, is recognised in income (loss) from
operations;

e the costs of unwinding the net obligation as well as actuarial gains
and losses due to changes in assumptions and experience
adjustments (difference between projected and actual) are
recognised in financial income [expense];

e the impact of plan amendments following renegotiations of
employee benefits is recognised in non-recurring income expense}.

Provisions for subsidiary risks

Equity investments held by Thales are measured at the end of each reporting
period and an impairment loss is recorded if necessary. In the event that
the investment is fully written down and Thales's share in the shareholders’
equity of the subsidiary or associate becomes negative, a provision for
subsidiary risks may be recognised when considered necessary.

Provisions for restructuring

Provisions for restructuring costs are recorded when a restructuring
programme has been agreed with a third party, approved by
Company management and announced before the reporting date,
resulting in an obligation to the third parties in question, and for which
the Company does not expect any consideration for the costs.

NOTE 18. LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS

Due to the nature of its business, Thales is exposed to the risk of
technical and commercial disputes.

Legal risks

To prevent disputes or limit their impact, Thales’s policy is to
systematically seek alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This
policy is reviewed on a regular basis to take into account changes in
the Group's core areas of business and is backed by employee training
programmes

In addition, Thales implemented a procedure several years ago to
centralise all civil, commercial and criminal litigation and claims. These
are handled by the Corporate legal Affairs department, with the
support of the Group companies concerned

In October 2017, Thales was notified of an arbitration award relating
to a. commercial dispute between the Republic of China and a group of
three French manufacturers, including Thales Systémes Aéroporiés, a
subsidiary of Thales.

This arbitration award, which falls under a contract concluded in 1992,

gives rise to a financial conviction of the entities. The total amount of the

award, including interest, is €227 million. The share of Thales

Systemes Aéroportés amounts to €64 million. The corresponding

charge was recorded in the accounts of the subsidiary as at
1 December 2017.

There are no other government, judicial or arbitration claims, of which
the Group is aware, which are pending or threatened, which could
have, or which had, in the course of the last 12 months, any significant
effect on the financial position or the profitability of the Company
and/or the Group.

THALES — 2017 Registration Document

18.2 Environment

Due to the nature of its business, Thales is exposed to environmental
risks related to potential adverse environmental and health effects
resulting from its activities, the impact of the environment on its
operations and non-compliance with new regulations applicable to its
activities and products.

For many years, Thales has regularly analysed and updated its
environmental risks on the basis of its business activities, scientific and
technical developments and emerging environmental challenges.

This analysis, represented by a risk mapping, is intended to:

ensure that employees and local residents are not exposed to health
and environmental risks;

© ensure the compliance of activities and products;
© analyse the impact of new regulations, including on product design;

e identify an appropriate organisational structure and associated
action plans, either at Group level or locally, according to the tisk
mapping results

In support of this analysis, an environmental management system has
been deployed at all sites in order to ensure the control and limitation of
the environmental impacts of the Group's products and activities. This
management system is deployed throughout the different business lines
as part of the Group's framework. Consequently, environmental skills
and know-how have been rolled out to services such as engineering,
research, procurement and contracts.

At 31 December 2017, provisions for environmental risks amounted to
€0.5 million

NOTE 20. MARKET RISKS

20.1 Accounting principles

The Thales parent company Treasury and Financing department is
active in the financial markets in order to reduce the interest rate and
foreign exchange risks of the Group

Interest rate derivatives

Thales uses interest rate derivatives to manage and reduce its exposure
fo interest rate fluctuations. When the derivatives are designated as
hedging instruments, the gains and losses on the hedge are recognised
in the same period as the hedged item.

Currency derivatives

Thales hedges currency risks arising on commercial offers entered into
by its subsidiaries, which are denominated in currencies other than the
main operating currency.

When the hedged item has a sufficient probability of occurrence, the
foreign exchange derivatives subscribed by Thales with banking
counterparties qualify for hedge accounting. Gains and losses on bank
derivatives are then recognised in income at the same rate as the gains
and losses realised on the guarantees offered to subsidiaries, in
accordance with the principle of symmetry applicable to hedging

20.2 Interest rate risk managem

transactions. Foreign exchange premiums are amortised in the income
statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the hedge.

When hedged items do not have a sufficient probability of occurrence,
the foreign exchange derivatives are deemed isolated open positions.
In this case, the market value of the derivative is recognised in the
balance sheet as an offsetting entry in a suspense account, also in the
balance sheet. A provision is recorded in the event of negative
valuation. This valuation takes into account Thales’s guarantee
commitments to subsidiaries under these offers.

Thales hedges currency risks related to firm contracts and normal
commercial transactions on behalf of its subsidiaries. As such, it
guarantees its operating subsidiaries a specific exchange rate for each
transaction and backs up its position by arranging currency derivatives
with banking counterparts. Gains and losses on bank derivatives are
then recognised in income at the same rate as the gains and losses
realised on the guarantees offered to subsidiaries, in accordance with
the principle of symmetry applicable to hedging transactions.

Thales hedges the currency risks related to its cash pooling system. The
gains and losses on currency derivatives are offset by the gains and
losses resulting from the revaluation of the hedged Group company
current accounts and loans. However, gains or losses related to the
derivatives’ swap points are spread over the term of the hedge
