1.2. Operating review; objectives achieved and actions implemented

The group’s development objectives are focused on profitable growth and the generation of shareholder value through
a strategy of business diversification based on high returns, efficiency and quality of service together with a
conservative risk profile, while maintaining high standards of ethics and professional conduct combined with
sensitivity to shareholders’ interests.

The bank has a business model that fosters long-term customer relationships through constant efforts to promote
customer loyalty by adopting an initiative-based proactive approach. The bank offers a comprehensive range of
products and services, competent and highly qualified personnel, a technological platform with ample capacity to
support future growth and a relentless focus on quality.

Since the onset of the financial crisis, Spain’s banking sector has been going through an unprecedented process of
consolidation. Higher levels of capital, stricter provisioning requirements, the economic recession and pressure from
the capital markets are some of the factors that have driven Spanish banks to merge and gain in scale, maximise
efficiency and strengthen their balance sheets.

During the last decade, Banco Sabadell has expanded its geographic presence and increased its market share in
Spain through several acquisitions, the largest of which was Banco CAM in 2012, which enabled it to notably expand
its balance sheet. In 2013 Banco Sabadell was able to undertake further corporate actions on economically
acceptable terms in a context of banking sector restructuring. Following the acquisition of the Penedés branch
network, Banco Gallego and Lloyds Espafa in 2013, Banco Sabadell is well positioned to grow organically and to
benefit from the economic recovery in Spain.

Synergies from the Banco CAM merger exceeded expectations, with the systems and operational integration of the
Penedés branch network into that of Banco Sabadell being successfully complemented in 2013, followed by the
integration of Banco Gallego and Lloyds Espafia in 2014.

Acquisitions and organic growth in recent years have enabled Banco Sabadell to reinforce its position in some of
Spain’s most prosperous regions (e.g. Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands) and to increase its market share in
other key areas. According to the most recent available information, at a national level, Banco Sabadell holds a market
share of 7.8% in lending and 6.5% in deposits (October 2015). Banco Sabadell also has a strong position in other
products such as ICO funding, with a market share of 18.9% (December 2015); commercial loans with a share of
10.4% (October 2015); direct salary payments with 6.4% (November 2015) and POS terminal transactions, with 17.9%
(September 2015).

Banco Sabadell has always been a leader in cross-border operations. It has continued to be so in 2015 through its
presence in strategic markets and by serving companies as they expand abroad, reaching market shares of 31.5%
and 16.5% in documentary credits for exports and imports, respectively (November 2015).

Internationalisation, on of the pillars of the bank’s current business plan, has been significantly carried out in 2015.
The acquisition of TSB meant that at 2015 year-end, 30% of the Group’s credit investment is abroad.

The short-term priority for TSB is the execution of its current business plan, on one hand, and the technological
migration and integration on the other hand. In the medium-term, Banco Sabadell’s high market share in the SMEs
sector in Spain, together with its international experience, will be a solid added-value tool to support TSB in the
development of efficient and high-quality services for SMEs in the United Kingdom.

In 2015, Banco Sabadell has experienced a favourable dynamic in the acquisition of off-balance funds, increasing its
weight on the balance sheet. The mutual funds share has increased from 5.1% at the beginning of 2015 to 6.0% in
December 2015.

Since 2007 deposits have been the Bank’s primary source of funding, thereby reducing its dependency on capital

markets. Other developments during the year include the successful completion of two senior debt issues for €750
and €1,000 million in June and October respectively, with a strong interest from investors.

214

In 2015, Banco Sabadell has maintained its policy of removing problem assets and it has implemented allowances of
€2,333 million, allowing it to achieve a coverage ratio of doubtful assets of 53.6%.

2 - BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND RESULTS
2.1. Global economic and financial environment

In 2015, the global economy has maintained a modest growth. The year has been marked by new episodes of political
and geopolitical instability, and also by more erratic behaviour of financial markets.

In the political arena, uncertainty regarding Greece during the first half of the year took centre stage. The new Government
elected in January, led by the political party Syriza, began a challenging process of negotiation with international lenders
regarding the terms of the financial aid programmes. The negotiations became increasingly complicated, ending with
Greece calling a referendum to decide on whether or not to accept the conditions of the rescue package. Furthermore, the
ECB froze the emergency liquidity that had been granted to the Greek banking sector, resulting in a significant outflow of
banking deposits, which required the establishment of capital controls. In this context, Greece became the first developed
country to break its financial commitments with the IMF, and significant doubts arose as regards to it remaining a member
of the Eurozone. In the end, a third international rescue package for Greece was granted, of up to €86 million, tied to an
important set of conditions. Following the agreement, the instability surrounding the country was significantly reduced,
and new elections were held (on 20 September), in which Syriza was victorious once again.

In the political arena, the victory of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, which won the elections with absolute
majority, also attracted widespread attention. This implies that a referendum will be held before the end of 2017 to decide
on whether or not the country will remain a part of the European Union. In Portugal, after the general elections, difficulties
in forming a government became apparent. Finally, the Socialist Party headed the government thanks to the support from
left-wing parties and despite obtaining fewer votes than the Conservative Party. In Spain, the conservative Partido Popular
won the general elections held on 20 December, although agreements and pacts will have to be reached in order to be
able to form a government. Lastly, in terms of the European development, work has continued on the Banking Union
process, with a proposal from the European Commission to create a European Deposit Guarantee Mechanism. Similarly,
the creation of the Capital Markets Union has also continued to develop, with the publication of an Action Plan up to
2017.

In the geopolitical arena, the conflict in Ukraine has taken second stage to the refugee crisis in Europe and the increasing
tension with regards to Syria, particularly after the terrorist attacks in Paris by the Islamic State.

With regards to the global financial markets, the abrupt summer movements are notable, fuelled by doubts concerning
the growth of China after the devaluation of the Chinese Yuan and amidst expectations that the first increase in interest
rates in nine years would take place in the United States. The evolution was particularly negative in terms of currencies,
stock exchanges and corporate debt of emerging countries, with similar reductions, and in some cases even more severe
reductions, reaching previous economic crisis levels.

In terms of activity in the United States, the economy has maintained growth rates similar to those seen in 2014, and the
labour market has continued to progress with the implementation of its normalisation process. The economy has been
negatively affected by the strength of the dollar and the reduced activity in the petroleum extraction sector. In the
Eurozone, despite the uncertainty surrounding Greece, activity has been more positive than in the previous year, backed
by the depreciation of the Euro, the lower price of crude oil and reduced financing costs. In the United Kingdom, the
economy has maintained a favourable trend, supported by the good performance of the labour market, although it is

215


--- Page 9 ---

experiencing lower growth rates than in 2014. In Japan, the economy has shown weakness, with its GDP declining in the
second quarter.

Emerging economies have witnessed lower growth rates than in 2014, affected by more restrictive financing conditions,
lower commodities prices and the structural deceleration in China. In China, this deceleration is framed within its process
of changing its production model. China has made progress in areas such as financial liberalisation, while the authorities
have continued to adopt measures to limit the deterioration of the country’s activities. On the other hand, in Latin America,
the economic situation has continued to decline in Brazil, in a context of political instability and severe fiscal imbalances
and declines in current accounts. Mexico has maintained a moderate growth rate, which slightly exceeds that of 2014. In
Colombia, the economy has decelerated, hindered by the deterioration of its petrol activity. Eastern Europe has suffered
an economic downturn and the financial crisis in Russia, which was still affected by the conflict in Ukraine, particularly in
the first half of the year.

The Spanish economy has maintained a highly favourable development, and has continued to stand out from other
Eurozone countries. In 2015, its GDP will have recorded growth in excess of 3.0%, something not seen since 2007.
Domestic demand has continued to be the main source of growth, while exports have maintained a notable dynamism.
The activity has benefited from lower crude oil prices, a reduced fiscal effort (e.g. tax reductions) and some favourable
financing conditions. The positive behaviour of the economic activity has been reflected in an improved behaviour in the
labour market, with an increase in net employment and a further decline in unemployment rates. With regards to the
external sector, the economy has maintained a situation of surplus current accounts for the third consecutive year. Lastly,
in terms of tax, the public deficit has continued to decline, although the European Commission estimates that in 2015 it
will be above the target GDP level of 4.2%.

In terms of inflation, it has remained at a very low level and a long way off from the targets of the monetary policies in the
main developed economies. Inflation has declined due to the lower price of crude oil and of commodities in general. In
this sense, the price of petrol was at its lowest in over a decade, affected by aspects such as a lack of adjustment of
supply and a weak demand. The underlying aspect of inflation (prices excluding food or energy) has shown a better
improvement than the general price index.

The monetary policy of the main central banks has continued to be accommodating. In the Eurozone, the ECB extended its
private asset purchase program in March, to allow public debt to also be purchased. This new program included monthly
purchases of assets for €60 million. At its December meeting, the ECB extended this program by six months, up to March
2017, and also reduced the deposit interest rate to -0.30%. The ECB’s monetary policy has enabled the German short part
of its price curve to remain in negative figures throughout the year. In fact, the two-year profitability of the German bond
has reached historical levels. In the United States, the Fed, in its December meeting, increased the benchmark interest
rate for the first time in nine years, to 0.25-0.50%. The improvement in labour market conditions was an influencing factor
in this decision. In the United Kingdom, the benchmark interest rate of the Bank of England has remained unaltered, at
0.50%, and the stock of assets acquired under its purchase program has also remained stable, at GBP 375 million. Lastly,
in Japan, the central bank has not made any changes to the monthly purchase volume of assets. In its December
meeting, it qualitatively modified some of the characteristics of its asset purchase program to facilitate its implementation.

The profitability of long-term public debt markets in the United States and Germany have remained at very reduced levels,
ending the year at levels only slightly above those of 2014. These assets have been supported by reduced inflation, the
accommodating characteristics of monetary policies and doubts concerning global economic growth. The profitability of
the German bond reached a new record low in April, due in part to the start of the ECB purchase programs and the
uncertainty surrounding Greece. The profitability of the German bond over 10 years, after having reached levels close to
0.0%, suffered a significant and historic increase, which can be explained, in part, by the idiosyncrasies of the operation of
the public debt market itself. This rate of increase gradually slowed throughout the second half of the year. In Europe,
public debt has continued to be supported by the ECB’s monetary policy, as shown by the limited recovery of country-risk
premiums when uncertainty surrounding Greece was at its highest. Credit rating agencies have introduced new credit
rating improvements in these countries. Throughout the year, risk premiums in Italy and Portugal have declined, while in
Spain the year-end has seen levels which are slightly above 2014 levels. Political uncertainty in Spain due to the various
elections, has contributed to worse behaviour in terms of assets. In any event, the profitability of public debt of these
countries has reached historic minimums.

In currency markets, the euro has once again been significantly devalued compared with the dollar and the pound
sterling. This depreciation largely occurred in the first quarter, coinciding with the announcement of the purchase of public
debt by the ECB. The yen, quoted against the dollar, ended the year at levels similar to those in 2014. The outflow of
capital from the Japanese economy, in a context where various domestic investors have diversified their portfolios to give

216


--- Page 10 ---

more weight to foreign assets, have caused the yen to depreciate. However, during the financial instability over the
summer, the yen acted as a safe asset and appreciated.

In terms of equity markets, European indices have been supported by the ECB’s monetary policy. During the summer, the
indices in both Europe and the United States were severely affected by doubts concerning global economic growth.
Throughout the year, in the United States, the S&P 500 has increased, in euro, by over 10%, although this improvement is
due exclusively to the appreciation of the dollar. In Europe, the EURO STOXX 50 has advanced by almost 4%, although
with a similar behaviour over all the European countries. The IBEX-35 in Spain has ended the year below its 2014 levels,
with a fall of 7%, while the German DAX, despite the Volkswagen scandal, has recorded an increase of close to 10%.

Finally, financial markets in emerging countries have maintained high volatility and were severely affected during summer,
with strong exchange depreciations and an abrupt stock market decline in China. The high volatility has been linked to
doubts concerning the extent of the economic deceleration in China, political instability in some countries, reduced prices
of commodities and concerns over a possible increase in the benchmark interest rate in the United States. In this context
of strong exchange depreciations, some central banks have been forced to increase their official interest rates in order to
avoid falling short of inflation expectations. Standard&Poor’s and Fitch withdrew the investment grade of Brazilian
sovereign debt in foreign currencies, which had been maintained since 2008.

2.3. Financial review

Balance sheet and income statement

In 2015, the acquisition of the entirety of TSB shares was finalised, reaching a shareholding of 100% of TSB’s share
capital (see Note 2 of these current accounts).

As a result, the variations in the balances on the balance sheet and the profit and loss accounts were affected by the

consolidation of TSB on 30 June 2015.

Banco Sabadell and its group ended 2015 with a net attributed profit of €708.4 million (€586.4 excluding TSB), after
making the transfers to insolvencies and provisions of the securities and real estate assets portfolio of €2,333.2
million.

The positive evolution of the ordinary banking business and the strict control over recurring operating expenses,

together with the adequate management of customer spreads and rigorous quality controls of the credit risk, complied
once more with the main pillars on which the development of Banco Sabadell activities in 2015 were based.

Balance sheet

At the end of 2015, total assets for Banco Sabadell amounted to €208,627.8 million (€165,249.6 million excluding
TSB), amply surpassing the figure at the end of 2014 (€163,345.7 million). This is mainly due to the acquisition of
TSB.

(€116,634.8 million excluding TSB). This item increased by 29.4% year-on-year (-1.1% excluding TSB) mainly as a
result of the acquisition of TSB, partially offset by a reduced volume of doubtful assets. Secured mortgage loans
formed the largest single component of gross lending, amounting to €90,538.6 million at 31 December 2015,
representing 60% of total gross loans and advances.

The evolution of the Group’s portfolio of problem assets improved in 2015. Quarter-on-quarter changes in these loans
ex-TSB (doubtful assets plus real estate assets not covered by the Asset Protection Scheme) were as follows:

Quarter-on-quarter movements in doubtful exposure and real
estate (836) (734) (839) (771) (284) (152) (338) = (492)

The decrease in doubtful assets was reflected in a loan loss ratio of 7.79% at the close of 2015, compared with
12.74% at the close of 2014 - a fall of 495 basis points. The provision coverage ratio for doubtful assets at 31
December 2015 was 53.6%, compared with 49.4% a year earlier.

In 2015, customer funds showed a positive trend and increased overall by 35.3% year on year (7.0% excluding TSB),
mainly due to the acquisition of TSB and also to the sustained increase of off-balance sheet funds, in particular
managed and traded funds associated with equity in credit investment schemes (CISs).

At 2015 year-end, on-balance sheet customer funds totalled €131,489.2 million (€96,227.0 million excluding TSB),
compared with €94,460.7 million at 2014 year-end. The balances of demand accounts totalled €84,536.1 million
(€53,849.5 million excluding TSB), representing a year-on-year change of 95.3% (24.4% excluding TSB) and customer
term deposits amounted to €46,376.3 million (€41,800.8 million excluding TSB), 13.1% lower than in the previous
year (21.7% lower excluding TSB). The downwards trend of interest rates in financial markets has caused a change in
the composition of on-balance sheet customer funds (between term deposits and demand accounts) and a transfer of
these to off-balance sheet funds.

Total off-balance sheet funds amounted to €37,381.1 million and increased by 23.0% compared with the previous
year. In this chapter, the uninterrupted growth of equity in credit investment schemes (CISs), which at 31 December
2015 stood at €21,427.3 million, representing a 36.4% increase compared with 2014 year-end, and the equity

221


--- Page 15 ---

balances, that increased to €4,001.9 million, representing a growth of 37.1% compared with 2014 year-end were
particularly notable.

Debit represented by marketable securities totalled €26,406.6 million at 2015 year-end, compared with €20,196.3
million at 31 December 2014. This increase was mainly due to the net increase in balances of bonds and
commitments issued by TSB securitisation funds.

The total of funds under management at 31 December 2015 amounted to €200,355.1 million (€160,605.2 million
excluding TSB), compared with €152,185.4 million at 31 December 2014, an increase of 31.7% in 2015 (5.5%
excluding TSB).

Net interest income totalled €3,202.8 million in 2015, rising by 41.7% on the previous year’s figure, with the ratio of
net interest income to average total assets and the customer margin both increasing significantly. This upward trend
was due to a reduction of financing costs and the acquisition of TSB. Excluding TSB, net interest income amounts to
€2,663.2 million at 2015 year-end, an increase of 17.9% compared with the previous year.

In terms of overall annual averages, the net interest margin for the year was 1.72% (1.61% excluding TSB), 34 basis
points higher than the figure for the previous year (1.38% in 2014). The higher average return on average total assets
was the result of several factors, mainly due to the rise in customer spreads (due mainly to the lower cost of customer
deposits), lower capital market funding costs, the reduction in problem assets and the improved profitability of recent
acquisitions.

Dividends received and income from equity-accounting undertakings together amounted to €51.7 million against €8.7
million in 2014 (an increase of €43.0 million). The increase was due to income from insurance and pension assets
that significantly increased compared with the previous year.

Net fees and commissions totalled €1,003.3 million (€924.5 million excluding TSB) due mainly to the acquisition of
TSB, a 16.5% increase year-on-year (7.4% excluding TSB). This increase was mainly due to the positive performance of
mutual funds and structuralisation and insurance (syndicated) operations, as well as the consolidation of TSB.

Fees and commissions derived from risk operations grew by €53.4 million overall, largely due to the acquisition of
TSB. Fees for services increased by €30.5 million, with a strong performance being shown in the securities,
credit/debit card and syndicated loan categories, driven by the growth in business volumes and the inclusion of TSB in
the consolidated group accounts. Fees and commissions related to mutual funds, insurance and pensions showed an
increase of €58.6 million on the previous year, attributable primarily to the growth of assets held in collective
investment schemes (CISs) sold by the group or under its management.

Income from financial operations totalled €1,208.2 million (€1,207.1 million excluding TSB), with particularly notable
gains from the sale of fixed income financial assets available for sale amounting to €1,045.5 million. The high level of
gains from financial operations derived from the management of the ALCO portfolio up to June 2015 is also
particularly noteworthy; these allowed hedging levels to be strengthened. In 2014, income from financial operations

2015 has seen a significant growth in investment in the large corporate clients segment. Closeness to customers and
excellent service provided by the Middle Office allows the bank to grow in terms of financing operations of large
corporations.

A key feature is also the increase seen in 2015 in specialist products, with a greater contribution of value, which is
evident in the recorded income figures: foreign trade operations, treasury distribution business and fees for structured
financing operations, the result in these cases of increased productivity in the offering of more sophisticated solutions
together with the coordination of specialist teams.

In 2015, net interest income attributed to Corporate Banking stands at €164 million, and the profit before tax at
€70.6 million. The ROE ratio stands at 8.4% and the cost/income ratio at 14.8%.

Banco Sabadell Banking Business America is comprised of various business units that together manage the financing
business of corporate, private and commercial banking in this geography. This business is managed from Miami,
where Banco Sabadell has a Full International Branch which has been operating since 1993, and a banking entity,
Sabadell United Bank, which develops the commercial banking business in South Florida. In 2012, the bank opened a
representative office in New York from which it manages a large part of the structured financing business and in 2015,
new representative offices have been opened in Colombia and Peru to strengthen the corporate banking and
structured financing business. Additionally, in 2014 Sabadell Capital was set up in Mexico, to develop a portfolio of
corporate credit and Project Finance, which has been consolidated in 2015.

Sabadell also works in coordination with the representative offices in Mexico, Dominican Republic and Venezuela,
rendering customer services.

Within the internationalisation plan framework, in August the bank was granted a banking licence in Mexico, which will
allow it to operate as a commercial bank in this country from early 2016. In this way, operations started in 2014 can
be extended with the start-up of Sabadell Capital, which is a multiple purpose financial institution (SOFOM).

In 2015, the bank has continued with its consolidation project of domestic banking in Florida through its subsidiary

Sabadell United Bank, strengthening its associate banking business and improvement programs for operating
efficiency.

In 2015 the development of the asset transformation strategy established in previous years has been further
implemented. Its main objective is the optimisation of value, either through management, to maximise the possible
changes in value, or through divestment, in the event that this is the best alternative.

With regards to debt recovery assets in default status, it is particularly important to note that in 2015 Banco Sabadell
has continued to proactively manage default situations of mortgage debts for customers’ housing, seeking solutions
that avoid legal proceedings and not carrying out, under any circumstances, forceful evictions.

Following the acquisition of one of SAREB’s real estate asset portfolios in November 2014, Solvia has been the first

‘servicer’ to complete the migration and service transfer process of portfolios acquired through SAREB, positioning
itself as one of the main management platforms in Spain in terms of the volume of assets managed.

We care about the future and about sustainability. This is why Banco Sabadell has an environmental policy in place, is
a signatory to the main international covenants on the environment and promotes a commitment to the environment
globally.

All departments of the organisation have the financial resources they need to meet Banco Sabadell’s aims and
commitments on the environment. Due to the structure of the group and the nature of its business, these funds are
not recognised under a specific line item to provide an overview of environment-related costs and investment.

Key environmental action areas:
Renewable energy - finance and investment

Banco Sabadell promotes the development of sustainable energy through direct investment and as a provider of
finance for renewable energy projects. As in previous years, the bank shared its experience in the renewables sector
and provided speakers at leading forums in Spain. These included events organised by the Spanish Wind Energy
Association and the Association of Renewable Energy Producers.

Banco Sabadell provides finance for renewable energy generation projects, such as wind energy, photovoltaic power,
thermal solar energy, biomass or biofuel projects, in addition to advisory and brokerage services for this type of energy
projects. Banco Sabadell also makes direct investments in the equity capital of renewable energy generation projects.

232


--- Page 26 ---

Most of this business is carried on through Sinia Renovables, a wholly-owned subsidiary.

The Equator Principles

Banco Sabadell adopted the Equator Principles in September 2011. Based on the policies, standards and guidelines
of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Principles apply to structured finance projects and corporate loans.

Since then, the bank has applied the Equator Principles to all of its new structured finance projects valued at an
amount greater than, or equal to, USD 10 million and corporate loans from USD 100 million. The projects are classed
as A, B or C following the standard developed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and in all class-A or B
projects a social and environmental assessment is carried out and reviewed by an independent expert.

Banco Sabadell publishes the details of each of its projects associated with the Equator Principles in its annual report,
and they can also be consulted through the bank’s website.

Environmental management and climate change management system

The Environment Committee is charged with overseeing compliance with group environmental policy and reviewing
group performance in environmental matters. The group has an environmental management system which was set up
in 2006 according to the ISO 14001:2004 standard. Currently 15.10% of the group’s employees in Spain work in one
of the six office buildings that have been certified to that standard. The environmental management system has been
adapted for use at all other group facilities in Spain.

Year after year Banco Sabadell works to improve the eco-efficiency of its facilities and reduce the environmental
impacts of the services it provides to customers.

Some of the measures it has taken to reduce consumption and emissions are as follows:

* — Inventory of CO2 emissions: In 2009 the Bank compiled an independently verified inventory of corporate CO2
emissions. In 2015, it set up a new reduction target of 3% for the period 2015-2020 of scope 1 and 2
emissions, taking 2014 as a base. In 2015, a reduction in emissions of 70.80% has been achieved, mainly
by purchasing electrical power generated from renewable sources.

* Power consumption; overall consumption of electrical power in Spain in 2015 was 97,642 MWh from
104,419 MWh in 2014. It should be noted that since April Banco Sabadell has increased its contracting of
renewable energy sources through Nexus Renovables, which has provided 71.8% of the total electricity
provided to the group in 2015.

* The majority of group branches are equipped with centralised heating and climate control systems. Lighting
systems fitted with LED lamps and presence detectors in some areas of Central Service buildings.

* Widespread use of low-energy lamps and billboard lighting systems fitted with daylight switching systems.
¢ Energy recovery climate control systems are installed in Central Service buildings and larger branches.

Branches are using Thin Client hardware that consumes 90% less energy than conventional PCs.

* Paper consumption: Reduce, reuse and recycle. Paper consumption by the group in Spain in 2015 was 1,469
tons (up from 1,039 tons in 2014). The increase was due to the addition of new businesses to the group and
the rise in customer numbers. At the same time, the main actions put in hand to reduce paper consumption
were as follows:

233


--- Page 27 ---

o Banking services are now available to customers 24 hours a day via remote access channels, ATMs,
telephone banking, email or social media. 100% of correspondence with customers was sent
electronically.

o Branches are equipped with digital tablets for customers’ signatures. In 2015 this made it possible
for 30 million printed forms to be eliminated.

o Conventional paper is chlorine-free, certified by the FSC and produced to ISO 9001 and ISO 14001
standards; all of the group’s printers are configured for duplex printing by default.

* Water usage: Water consumption is limited to sanitary uses and to some watering of gardens. In 2015 the
group’s water consumption resulted in costs of €1.08 million (€1.1 million in 2014). With regard to waste
water management, all our facilities and offices are connected to the public sewage network. Toilet cisterns
and taps are fitted with water-saving mechanisms. The main group Central Service building has a cistern for
collecting rainwater and greywater for watering plants. Landscaped areas have been planted with
autochtononous drought-resistant plants.

* In 2014, the lawn at the Agua Amarga corporate building (Alicante) began to be replaced with decorative
gravel, which has resulted in savings of approximately 60% of water usage in 2015.

* Waste management: In 2015 the group generated 819 tons of waste paper and card (883 tons in 2014). In
all group premises, used paper is treated as confidential waste for shredding and 100% is recycled through
authorised waste managers. All Central Service buildings have facilities for the separation and collection of
packaging, organic matter and batteries. Banco Sabadell works with Ricoh (only branches as banking printers
are available) and the HP Planet Partners programme to manage the collection and reuse of toner cartridges
and disposes of computer waste through authorised waste managers. There are specific oversight
mechanisms for managing waste at branches that are in the process of closing or being merged.

Environmental training and awareness

All group employees have access to an online training course which is obligatory for staff at certified Central Service
facilities.

Banco Sabadell also keeps all its suppliers informed on the group’s environmental policy and integrates environmental
and social responsibility into its supply chain in a number of ways. In the group-level procurement process, tenders or
offers from suppliers with ISO 9001, ISO 14001/EMAS or EFQM certifications are looked on favourably. Consideration
is given to the environmental qualities (recycled, ecological, good for the environment, etc.) of the products offered.
Banco Sabadell’s basic contract with suppliers includes specific clauses on compliance with environmental criteria,
human rights and the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, as well as acceptance of the Supplier Code
of Conduct. In particular, environmental requirements are included in specification for products and services that have
significant environmental impacts.

4.- HUMAN RESOURCES

Human Resources aims to support the transformation of the organisation through a people agenda that is an integral
part of its day-to-day business operations and its growth. Its key objective is to maximise the value-creating potential of
Banco Sabadell’s highly skilled workforce by developing their talent, managing their expectations and fully leveraging
their capabilities.

Talent management and human capital form an essential component of the new “Triple” strategic business plan along
with other key action areas of the plan.

The Triple plan includes drivers of organisational change and development as well as a wide-ranging and completely
updated view of the Human Resources function.

In the area of organisational change and development, three strategic priorities have been identified: comprehensive
talent management (strengthening leadership and fostering a culture in which talent is planned for and nurtured) to
meet the needs generated by growth; raising the bar on employee performance (a universal model for today’s

234


--- Page 28 ---

business that allows people performance to be actively managed); and involving and engaging all employees in the
Group’s development.

In terms of its external employees, the tendency is changing towards the hiring of personnel with training at the degree
or diploma levels. Most of the hiring is carried out in response to an accumulation of tasks, however other reasons for
which Banco Sabadell hires personnel externally are to fill a temporary position, to temporarily replace a worker whose
post is being maintained, among others. The contracting of external personnel also facilitates introduction of recent
graduates or students into the labour market.

Human resources management - policies and principles

Human resources policy is grounded in respect for human dignity, fair and competitive remuneration, transparency
and truthfulness in reporting, and lasting cooperation.

235


--- Page 29 ---

Recruitment policy

In line with its human resources policy, Banco Sabadell has a personnel selection process which ensures that
objective criteria based on professionalism and suitability are applied in finding the right person for each job and
career path. The group seeks to ensure optimal professional development for its employees by encouraging them to
excel and rewarding hard work. This mutual commitment is set out in the Banco Sabadell Group Code of Conduct.

In 2015 the Bank worked on a number of initiatives to strengthen and adapt its procedures for recruiting and
attracting talent.

Banco Sabadell is not only competing in an ever more global, dynamic and competitive environment, but is also
currently undergoing a major programme of transformation, expansion and internationalisation, for whose success
having the best talent is critical.

Attracting, selecting and recruiting staff are a part of this new environment: a higher intake of new employees, new job
profiles and geographic dispersion are making it necessary to redesign and update the procedures, skills, technologies
and capabilities used to attract the best candidates and provide them with a professionally rewarding experience.

To meet this need the group has launched an ambitious internal recruitment program, whose purpose is to provide
opportunities for career development and to favour internal movements of employees within the Group.

In line with the defined human resources model and policies, the volume of international movements continues to
grow. The bank is still working on the consolidation of a portfolio of employees to selectively create future expansion,
as well as the incorporation of international experience in management careers.

Equality, work-life balance and integration

Banco Sabadell guarantees equal opportunities in all aspects of its relations with employees: recruitment, training,
promotion, working conditions, remuneration, etc. These principles are also set out in the Group’s equality plan,
human resources policy and code of conduct.

Equality

In 2010, Banco Sabadell adopted an equality plan aimed at avoiding all types of employment discrimination between
women and men in the company, as required by Organic Law 3/2007. Certain lines of action were established for this
purpose, including effective tracking and goal evaluation systems covering training, promotion and career
development, remuneration, work-life balance, gender violence and sexual harassment. The equality plan’s Steering
Committee, which consists of employee and bank representatives, meets twice per year to monitor progress and
compliance with the equality plan.

% of promoted employees who are women 56.45% 56.06%

Figures calculated for the group's total workforce.
Diversity and integration

Banco Sabadell promotes employee diversity and integration in the workplace and non-discriminatory recruitment
processes. The group takes action to adapt workplaces wherever necessary. The bank also assists employees with
paperwork in their dealings with municipal, regional and national governments, thus helping to improve employees’
well-being outside the strictly professional sphere. In compliance with Spain’s Integration of People with Disabilities act
(“LISMI”), the bank pursues other measures such as buying services and supplies from special employment centres.

In 2015 the Group has 254 employees with some form of disability (156 at the end of 2014).
Disability is not the only diversity issue that the Bank handles in a special way.

The human resources master plan involves important changes to the way in which managers and directors manage
people and equipment. As part of talent management, one of the immediate challenges is to attract, develop, maintain
and transfer talent in accordance with the expectations of each of the generations working together in the bank (baby
boomers, generation X and millenials). A very ambitious plan has been approved to tackle this issue, closely linked to

236


--- Page 30 ---

current and future development of the age pyramid in the Group.

Work-life balance

Group employees enjoy a series of benefits thanks to an agreement between the bank and union representatives on
ways of striking the right balance between work and personal and family life. Benefits include time off from work, paid
or unpaid (e.g. to nurse an infant); unpaid leave (for maternity or to care for a relative); leave in special circumstances;
paternity leave; and flexitime arrangements.

In this regard, another objective is to provide the organisation and people with tools and solutions for flexibility at work
as required by the business strategy in order to improve productivity and competitiveness.

Compensation policy

Banco Sabadell’s compensation policy is based on the principles of internal fairness, external competitiveness,
transparency, differentiation, flexibility, simplicity, confidentiality and communication, as prescribed by the Group’s
human resources policy.

Compensation policy is based on the degree of responsibility attaching to the position and on each employee’s
professional development. This determines Group practices with regard to increases in both fixed and variable
remuneration. In total, 89.7% of the workforce in Spain qualified for variable remuneration in 2015 (74.2% in 2014).

Other types of benefit are available to employees, including interest-free loans and grants to help with training or
children’s schooling.

Of particular relevance in this field is the launch of a new management model by objectives, with over 56,300
objectives, in a ‘cascade’ process, implemented in the first months of 2015.

Workplace hazards

Banco Sabadell has a policy of constantly striving to improve employees’ health and working conditions.

As required by law, the bank has a health and safety plan setting out policy measures in this area. Each year it
publishes a report on health and safety initiatives undertaken by the company which is available on the employee
portal and the corporate website.

An initial risk assessment is performed on each new workplace and also on workplaces that have undergone
refurbishment or alterations. A follow-up assessment is performed at a later date to evaluate both individual
workstations and common areas, facilities as well as aspects such as temperature, lighting, etc. In 2015, 3,902
questionnaires on psycho-social risk were sent out, producing a 69.68% response rate.

All Banco Sabadell personnel and new employees receive information on workplace hazard prevention and are
required to take an online course in health and safety at work. The training is supplemented by publications, such as
ergonomics factsheets and equipment manuals, related to the specific hazards affecting bank employees.

Employee development
Training

Banco Sabadell provides employees with function-based training: continuous, progressive training adapted to each
individual's position.

Figures for Spain.

The launch of a new language learning tool has been particularly significant this year, introduced in response to the
growing needs to learn languages as a result of the Group’s internationalisation process.

The definition of a structure and objectives for the future Commercial School is also particularly relevant, which will
allow people to align learning with business and commercial transformation challenges in which the Bank is engaged.

At the same time, the Commercial School will also be a key lever to provide sustainability to the commercial systematic
network model which has been implemented as part of the Commercial Development Programme. A first glimpse of
this new learning focus in Banco Sabadell and something that shall form part of the School is the Grow Up programme
for new Office managers. Its purpose is to develop and transform the Manager, allowing them to eventually become a
Business leader and, also, a Team leader in their office.

To reinforce this, Excellence Centres have been created with consultants who are specialised in each area (Training,
Remuneration, Recruitment, etc.) who centralise their functional knowledge in terms of the business needs.

Leadership development

The transformation of the Leadership Management unit into the Strategic Talent Division has represented a qualitative
leap in the development of the leadership capacity at all managerial levels of the organisation. The group of managers
that form part of the corporate development programme continues to carry out regular psychometric evaluation and
360° assessments which collect feedback from direct superiors, colleagues and subordinates. They also receive
specific strategic leadership training designed to enhance their leadership and team management skills.

In this context, the figure of the Human Resources Business Partner (HRBP) is notable under the management of the
Strategic Talent Division. The HRBP is a consultant with decision-making authorities in the planning, prioritisation and
management of specific needs which, in terms of people, are derived from the strategy of each business.

In terms of specific programmes, the Leading the Future (Liderando el Futuro) programme is a comprehensive
Leadership Development programme aimed at managers to strengthen a leadership style that is common in Banco
Sabadell and which promotes cooperation and development of teams, with a strong focus on action and business.

With this programme, carried out through a cutting edge flexible and integrated methodology, we encourage our
managers to have a shared leadership vision and standard, and we favour the professional growth and development
in line with the Bank’s culture, using personal change as a basis to facilitate changes at an organisational level. The
programme has a synergic effect where it achieves the ‘cascade’ transfer of knowledge of the people forming part of
the teams, as well as a warmer and more human attitude. These attitudes position our Managers as a reference of
quality and openness, both internally and in the external market. 15 managers took part in one or more of the stages
of this Programme in 2015.

One of the main outcomes of this exercise has been the continuation of the Corporate Management Programme,
which is designed for new department heads and Central Services directors with subordinates working under them.
The Programme is based on developing management and team-building skills, promoting joined-up management at
Central Services divisions and improving familiarity with Human Resources policies as a way of managing professional
development and promoting success-driven behaviours appropriate to each role. A total of 43 employees took this
training in 2015, its fifth year.

238


--- Page 32 ---

One of the organisation’s main tools in managing people and focusing on results is the annual performance review
and interview, where managers hold a mandatory one-to-one meeting with their direct reports, the goal being also to
foster professional growth and build trust. During the interview the employee’s performance during the year and their
performance assessment, occupational goals and geographic mobility are discussed. This year the assessment has
been simplified, and the integration of the Management by Objectives and the evaluation of performance has been
integrated into a single model.

HR Operations

In terms of operations, in 2015 a division has been created which combines the operating tasks of all Human
Resources departments. The Shared Services Centre is added to the already existing Employee Assistance Office,
which focuses on rendering services to the other departments, thereby achieving greater efficiency through
specialisation. This allows the human resources teams to focus on their specific function, resulting in greater
ambitions and an improved achievement of the corresponding objectives.

Communication, participation and the volunteer programme
Communication

Banco Sabadell has numerous channels of communication between the different levels of the organisation to enhance
internal communication and involve employees in the bank’s goals.

The “Banco Sabadell Idea” platform allows employees to propose improvements in any area of the organisation. The
platform is also an excellent communication channel by which employees can make queries and share experiences on
products and processes. The ideas with the most votes and those which add the greatest value to the bank are
considered by the persons in charge of the processes concerned and by members of a Decision Committee, who
together reach a decision on their implementation. The ideas with most votes also receive a cash prize.

Participation

Banco Sabadell respects and guarantees employees’ basic rights, including freedom of association and collective
bargaining, enshrined in Spanish law. These principles are set out in its code of conduct and human resources policy.

Union representatives represent the entire workforce, not just union members; accordingly, labour agreements apply
to all employees at the level at which the negotiation was conducted (industry, group, company, etc.). All employees
are given one month’s notice of significant changes. Union elections are held every four years. Banco Sabadell’s
management meets periodically with the general secretaries of the various trade unions and the latter participate
regularly in various committees (National Health and Safety Committee, Equal Opportunities Committee, Training
Committee and the Pension Plan Oversight Committee). Workplaces with more than 50 workers have a works council.
Workplaces with between 6 and 10 workers may elect a union representative.

Volunteer programme

In response to this line of action, defined in the Corporate Social Responsibility Plan 2013, SabadellLife, a new internal
portal, has been introduced; it incorporates all actions that involve our employees in terms of health, solidarity and
sport.

SabadellLife publicises social action and corporate volunteer initiatives. The successes achieved year after year has
led to a substantial increase in the number of volunteers and in the activities organised in 2015, many of which were
proposed by the employees themselves.

239


--- Page 33 ---

Details of some of the most significant activities in 2015 are given below:

Trailwalker of Oxfamllntermon. 324 people representing Banco Sabadell took part in this year’s Trailwalker, making us
the company with the largest number of employees taking part in Madrid, raising over €90,000 for water management
projects carried out by Oxfam in the Sahara.

Sant Jordi Solidari en Centros Corporativos de Sant Cugat, Sabadell and Torre Diagonal. Associates such as Escuela
Taiga (Special Needs Education), the Protectora de Sabadell, Ayuda en Accién and Sant Joan de Déu, among others,
raised over €7,500 (net) for charity.

Collection of toys and school supplies for children at risk of social exclusion in the various regions.

Collaboration with the Food Bank, where over a ton of foods have been collected for the needy among all regional
branches.

Together with Banc de Sang y Teixits, Banco Sabadell makes blood donations, where year after year the number of
blood donations has significantly increased.

For the third year in a row, 215 volunteers from the Bank participated in workshops for fourth grade pupils as part of
the Schools Financial Education Programme in Catalonia (EFEC). The collaboration agreement with Catalonia’s
regional government (Generalitat de Catalunya) and the Instituto de Estudios Financieros covered 20% of schools in
Catalonia. Additionally, this year Banco Sabadell has taken part in the “Tus Fianzas, tu futuro” (Spanish Banking
Association) programme, where 35 volunteers shared basic knowledge about finance to second and third grade pupils
throughout Spain.

In 2015, various corporate volunteer programmes have been carried out related to entrepreneurship through the
senior collective, with the collaboration of particularly relevant Foundations with an important social impact: Fundacion
Emprén, Fundacion Princesa de Girona, Proyecto Cecrem, ADEIT Generalitat Valenciana, Fundacién Novia Salcedo,
Fundaci6n Cares-Codec, Mes que Emprenedors-COTM and Proyecto Hombre de reinsercién laboral.

This year, 475 letters were requested from the Magone Foundation, so that Banco Sabadell employees could become
Wise Men at Christmas for a day, sending a Christmas gift to children at risk of social exclusion.

As in previous years, 120 volunteers took part in the Maraté de TV3 (a marathon organised by the television channel
TV3), which this year raised funds for combatting cardiovascular diseases.

COACH Foundation: a corporate volunteer initiative aimed at improving employability of young people at risk of social
exclusion through coaching and mentoring. Ten young people have benefitted from this Programme this year.

Social Business Mentoring with the SHIP2B Foundation. 17 directors of Banco Sabadell have taken part as mentors in
the B-Ready programme to accelerate social start-ups.

“FeinaambCor” Project. Together with Caritas, people over the age of 45 who were at risk of social exclusion have
been employed by our temporary employment agencies.

5 - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
5.1 Liquidity

The key aspects in the evolution of liquidity during the year at the group level have been as follows:

= The objective of recent years of generating a liquidity gap in commercial business, reducing overall financing in
wholesale markets and increasing the liquidity position of the bank has continued to be followed.

=  On-balance sheet customer funds have increased by 39.2% compared with 2014 year-end, mainly due to the
acquisition of TSB.

= In 2015, the generation of a Commercial gap has stabilised, continuing to grow albeit at a more moderate pace
than the positive trend seen in recent years. The Loan to Deposits (LTD) ratio of the group at year-end stood at

240


--- Page 34 ---

106.5% (108.2% excluding TSB).

The group has slightly reduced (exTSB) its percentage of financing on wholesale markets. During the year,
maturities in capital markets have been reached amounting to €3,277 million. On the other hand, Banco
Sabadell performed two public issuances of five-year mortgage covered bonds in May and October 2015 for a
total of €750 million and €1 billion euros, respectively. In November 2015, TSB launched a securitisation
operation for the amount of GBP 535 million.

In 2015, the three agencies that assessed the credit quality of Banco Sabadell were Standard & Poor's,
Moody’s and DBRS. In June, the credit rating agency Moody’s, as a result of the publication of its new
methodology and the review of governmental support, upgraded the rating of the long-term deposits of Banco
Sabadell by +2 notches to Baa3 (from Ba2) and the long-term senior debt by +1 notch to Bai (from Ba2). The
rating of short-term deposits was upgraded to P3 (from not-prime) and the rating of the short-term senior debt
remained unchanged at not-prime. The rating of mortgage covered bonds and territorial bonds was upgraded
by +4 notches up to Aa2 (from A3). In September, DBRS Ratings Limited downgraded the long-term rating of
Banco Sabadell to BBB high (from A low) and confirmed the short-term rating of R1 low, reflecting the outlook
that the agency has in terms of the evolution of European regulations and legislation, where there is less
certainty in terms of the likelihood of systemic support.

Banco Sabadell has participated in the targeted four-year liquidity auctions of BCE (TLTRO) for an aggregate
amount at year end of €11 billion (€5 billion euros corresponding to the TLTRO of 17 December 2014.)

The group has maintained a liquidity buffer in the form of liquid assets, to meet any possible future liquidity
needs. The acquisition of TSB has positively affected the first line of liquidity of the entity by approximately €3
billion, with a high-quality portfolio of liquid assets mainly concentrated in cash and gilts.

On 1 October 2015, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) came into force, with a regulatory minimum requirement
of 60%. All UGLs of the group have widely surpassed this minimum. At the group level, the LCR ratio of the
entity has been permanently and stably positioned over the year at well above 100%. As regards the Net Stable
Funding Ratio (NSFR), with the date set for its implementation in January 2018, the entity has continued to
maintain stable levels above 100%.

Key figures and basic liquidity ratios at the end of 2015 were:

5.2. Capital resources

Note 5, Shareholders’ equity and capital management of the consolidated report of the group, contains a detailed
report of the capital management (regulatory framework, detailed data and capital activity).

The main figures related to capital management are shown below:

Note 5 of the memorandum explains the main changes compared with the previous year in terms of regulation,
evolution of risk weighted assets (RWAs) and the main components of own funds. Banco Sabadell has maintained an
active capital management in 2015, which it has been carrying out in recent years, and which is a key aspect for the
growth of the entity. Over the last four years, the bank has increased its capital base through issues classified as tier
one capital, as shown in the table below:

M =nillion euro

Note: The capital impact (in basis points) is calculated using year-end dala every year, and these figures have varied significantly due to new companies being incorporated into the group over the
last few years.

6.-RISKS

In 2015, Banco Sabadell Group has continued to strengthen its risk management framework, making improvements in
line with financial sector best practice.

For more details regarding the corporate risk culture, strategic risk framework and global organisation of the risks
function, as well as the main financial and non-financial risks, see Note 4, Financial Risk Management in the
consolidated annual accounts for 2015.

This year’s main milestones in terms of the group’s risk management have been the strengthening of the Risk Appetite
Framework, adding an international focus point, and the improvement of the group’s risk profile over the year, as
explained in greater detail in Note 4 of the Memorandum.

7 - POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS

Since 31 December 2015, there have been no significant events worthy of mention.

8 - EXPECTED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

Banco Sabadell adopts three-year strategic plans designed in accordance with macroeconomic and regulatory
conditions. The success it has had in implementing each of its previous strategic plans allowed Banco Sabadell to be
ready for the new one and to have a high level of confidence in its successful outcome.

The “Optima 2010” plan had the aim of preparing the bank to become an efficient platform for growth. Once that had
been achieved, the “CREA” plan focused on organic and inorganic growth, which enabled the bank to reach critical

243


--- Page 37 ---

mass so as to compete effectively in the Spanish financial system while the whole sector was undergoing a process of
concentration.

During the implementation phase of the “CREA” plan, Banco Sabadell was able to transform itself commercially,
growing its customer base by a factor of three, increasing market shares and optimising its resources.

In the current macroeconomic context, having completed the restructuring and integration of Banco CAM and several
acquisitions in 2013 in order to continue strengthening its franchise, Banco Sabadell started a new business plan in
2014 that aims to extract value from their customer base by leveraging its new size and margin-generating capability.
The main goal of the 2014-2016 Triple Plan is Profitability. Key themes of the new plan are Transformation
(transformation of the business, transformation of the production process and transformation of the balance sheet)
and Internationalisation (laying the foundations for becoming more international in terms of structure, resources, etc.)
and entering new markets.

The result of the second year of the Plan’s implementation in terms of the set targets has been very satisfactory.

In 2016 Banco Sabadell has already started to work on a new plan for the 2017-2019 period which is based on the
strength of its sources of income.

The main financial elements are: substantial reduction of problem assets, normalisation of the balance sheet,
achievement of double-digit profitability, continued advances in terms of digital transformation, consolidation of the
America project and the value enhancement of TSB.

9 - RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION

2015 has been marked by the start of the TSB project, with a strong impact on the technological organisation, which
has been restructured to take on the project with the utmost guaranties. At the international level, the project that will
allow the Bank to start operating in Mexico as a multi-purpose banking institution has also been completed.

A Systems Plan has been conducted in parallel, as intensively as in the previous year, in line with the objectives of the
Triple business plan 2014-2016.

In terms of boosting commercial development, the implementation of the new campaign management tools has
continued and the project for the development of the commercial portfolio of the managers and of the customer file is
underway. A project has been developed to simplify the contracting of the basic pack for the Expansion Account,
allowing the number of pages to be reduced from 40 to 4, and optimising its functionality. A move towards a more
optimised process for the registration of new customers has also begun for individuals, sole proprietors and
companies, linked to the contracting of the basic pack, and this is also being incorporated into a single Customer
contract.

In the area of corporate mobility, the functions of product simulation, monitoring, reporting and contracting have been
broadened, allowing commercial managers to perform all their activities on the move using their tablets. This has been
aided by the completion of our Centralised Signature platform, incorporating new signature modalities: trusted third
party, second distance banking password and biometric signature.

In the field of active Risk management, work is underway on the retailers and sole proprietors risk models, and on new
means of sanctioning operations for retailers and companies, and to create a new end-to-end circuit in the area of
loan/loss management.

Additionally, for Treasury, Markets and Asset Management, during this year the bank has worked to adapt the systems
to negative rates and implement a new customer risk control system for Treasury operations in FX (TGR), and the
adaptation of the platform to the New Markets Reform.

As regards to the Corporate Administration Systems, the most noteworthy actions performed during the year are
centred on projects to adapt hub branches management systems (Hub&Spoke) and the Active Management
Commercial Network. Also worthy of mention in the field of Human Resources are new projects for internal talent
management, training and employee expense management.

b) Dividend policy

The bank’s shareholders’ remuneration policy, in accordance with the bank’s Statutes of Association, is submitted to
shareholders for approval on a yearly basis at the Annual General Meeting.

In 2014, the bank compensated shareholders with €0.05 per share through a flexible remuneration scheme that
offers them the chance to choose to receive this remuneration in cash and/or in new shares, and a complementary
remuneration consisting in the handover of shares from the treasury portfolio. The percentage acceptance of
remuneration in shares was 88.4%.

For 2015, the Board of Directors of the bank will propose the same remuneration scheme to the Annual General
Meeting but with a value of €0.07 per share. This amount represents profits on the quoted share price of 4.3% (2.5%
in 2014).

Over the coming years, Banco Sabadell foresees an increase in cash payments as remuneration to shareholders.

c) Managing the credit rating

In 2015 the three agencies rating Banco Sabadell’s credit quality were Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and DBRS. The
current ratings, and the last dates on which they were affirmed, are as follows:

Long term Short term Outlook Last review
Standard & Poor’s BB+ B Stable 2/12/15
Moody s Bat NP Stable 17/06/15
DBRS BBB (high) R-1 (low) Stable 29/09/15

On 17 June 2015, Moody’s Investor Service completed the review whereby it had allocated the ratings on 17 March
2015, as a result of the publication of its new methodology and the review of the government aid. The credit rating
agency upgraded the rating for the long-term deposits of Banco Sabadell by +2 notches to Baa3 (from Ba2) and of the
senior long-term debt by +1 notch to Ba (from Ba2). The rating of the short-term deposits increased to P3 (from not-
prime) and the rating of the senior short-term debt remained at not-prime. The outlook changed to stable.

On 18 June 2015, Moody’s Investor Service also concluded the review of the mortgage covered bonds started on 17
March 2015. The result was an upgrade in the rating of the mortgage covered bonds by +4 notches to Aa2 (from A3).

On 29 September 2015, DBRS Ratings Limited completed the review whereby it had allocated the ratings of various
European banking groups on 20 May 2015, reflecting the outlook that the agency has in terms of the evolution of
European regulations and legislation, where there is less certainty in terms of the likelihood of systemic support. This
action implied a downgrade in the long-term rating of Banco Sabadell to BBB high (from A low). Short-term rating was
confirmed at R1 low. DBRS also changed the outlook of Banco Sabadell to stable (formerly negative) reflecting the
improvement of the bank’s fundamentals, particularly asset quality and profitability.

On 2 December 2015, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services improved the outlook of Banco Sabadell to stable (from
negative) and upheld the long-term rating of BB+, and the short-term rating of B. The credit rating agency has
improved the intrinsic credit profile of the entity (Stand Alone Credit Profile - SACP) by +1 notch to bb+ (from bb) due
to the improvement of the bank’s risk profile, thus compensating the elimination of the notch from government
support which the rating of Banco Sabadell had to date.

All agencies have stressed the improvement of the credit standing of Banco Sabadell and have favourably viewed the
improvement made in its credit quality.

During 2015, Banco Sabadell has met with the three agencies. At these visits and teleconferences, the discussions
