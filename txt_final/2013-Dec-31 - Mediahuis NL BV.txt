nancial performance

The recurring EBITDA result for 2013 was € 60.1 million
and as such is € 10.8 million higher than the previous year.
The increase is primarily due to the impact of the cost re-
ductions;

Due to a provision of € 37 million for restructuring costs the
EBIT result declined from € 16.2 million positive in 2012 to
€ 10.3 million negative in 2013.

The revenues in the amount of € 542.2 million were € 13.6
million lower than they were in 2012 due to the declining
revenues from advertising and circulation, but were in part
offset by revenues from digital activities and revenue from
distribution for third parties;

The revenues from digital activities (including video) rose
by 11.6% to € 69.2 million (2012: € 62.0 million). The in-
crease was primarily due to an increase in e-commerce and
Dichtbij.nl;

The 2012-2016 cost reduction programme was increased
by € 50 million during 2013 as a result of which the total
programme now amounts to € 120 million and is slated to
be completed by the end of 2014. A total of 700 jobs are
eliminated under the programme. In 2013, an additional € 37
million in restructuring costs were recognised. The number
of FTEs for continued operations declined by 286 to 2,459
at year-end 2013;

The interest in ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG was sold for over
€ 390 million (following the receipt of a net dividend of over
€ 61 million). The net result of € 177.9 million includes the
result on the sale of the equity interest in ProSiebenSat.1
Media AG in the amount of € 218.3 million in relation to the
valuation of the shares at the time they were listed on the
stock exchange;

During 2013, Telegraaf Media Groep distributed an interim
dividend to shareholders on two occasions in the amount
of € 0.50 and € 6.00, respectively, per share or depositary
receipt for a share.

The advertising and circulation income are under pressure,
although the advertising revenues of the free local papers
(distributed door-to-door) showed fragile recovery during the
last months of 2013. The total revenues from continued opera-
tions declined by € 13.6 million in 2013.

The cost savings in 2013 were sufficient to offset the decline in
revenues. Due to the declining revenue from print activities as a
result of structural as well as economic cyclical trends a focus on
cost control remains crucial.

The recurring EBITDA result amounted to € 60.1 million in 2013
(11.1% of revenues) compared to € 49.3 million in 2012 (8.9%
of revenues).

In 2013, a restructuring provision of € 37.0 million (2012: € 0.4
million) was made due to the additional FTE reduction. As a re-
sult, the operating result (EBIT) was negative € 10.3 million com-
pared to positive € 16.2 million in 2012.

The segment online activities has been terminated in 2013.
Allnon print related online activities are either sold, discontinued
or classified as held for sale. The result after tax of these ac-
tivities is negative € 42.7 million (2012: negative € 44.7 million).
This includes € 29.1 million (2012: € 36.5 million) in impairments.
concerning intangible assets.

The net result realised in 2013 was € 177.9 million. The financial
income and expenses includes the result of the ProSiebenSat.1
participating interest up until 19 August in the amount of € 12.2
million. The shares in ProSiebenSat.1 were sold on 6 September
2013. The realised result on the sale in comparison to the valua-
tion as at 19 August was € 218.3 million.

The economic slump persisted unabated in 2013, as a result of
which consumer and producer confidence in the Netherlands re-
mained low. Media spending by advertisers continued to be un-
der pressure as well, and a shift in media spending, from print to
online, has been perceptible for a number of years. These trends
combined with TMG’s sensitivity to cyclical economic move-
ments have resulted in a decline of advertising and circulation
income from print operations.

TMG’s total revenues fell by € 13.6 million to € 542.2 million.
The decline in advertising and circulation income, respectively,
was € 15.2 million and € 10.6 million.

Advertising revenues from print activities declined by 15.5% and
were partially offset by revenues from digital activities and rev-
enue from distribution for third parties. On a percentage basis,

13

the decline was highest for the regional dailies (-22.5%) and the
free local papers (distributed door-to-door) (-13.5%). The de-
cline was evident in virtually all sectors (national, regional and
personnel) and, in addition, in the free local papers (distributed
door-to-door) segment was also due to removing a number of
titles from the market. The decline for the national dailies, rela-
tively speaking, was not as high (-13.0%). De Telegraaf clearly
remains the market leader in terms of circulation.

The restyling of the Sky Radio 101 FM (new programming and
marketing campaign) in 2012 resulted in a rise in listener figures
in 2013. As a result advertising income increased by € 3.8 mil-
lion, representing a net increase of 11.4% (2012: -1.2%). The Sky
Radio Group’s market share of the advertising market increased
in 2013. Sky Radio won the 2013 Best Broadcasting Station Mar-
coni Award and Radio Veronica initiated a renewal of its format
in 2013.

The revenues from digital activities (including video) rose by
11.6% to a total of € 69.2 million. Telegraaf.nl on an average day
attracts more than 2.1 million unique visitors (source: DDMM)
and as such remains one of the top Dutch news sites. Revenues
from e-commerce increased by € 5.0 million (28%) in 2013.
Dichtbij.nl showed an increase of € 2.4 million (2%).

Circulation revenues fell by € 10.6 million to € 280.1 million.
For print activities this is primarily due to the lower consumer
confidence and the migration of particularly younger consum-
ers to digital media. In relation to other daily newspapers, De
Telegraaf’s drop in circulation was high; the above-referenced
trend has hit the market leader hardest. Increasingly more con-
sumers are accessing the news via tablets and smartphones.
Single copy sales abroad consequently declined as well. A pro-
motion concerning the sale of two-year subscriptions combined
with an iPad was initiated in the fourth quarter. Paid premium
content subscriptions have also been introduced for regional
media. This initiative is meeting with success.

Of the total revenues in 2013, € 59.9 million was realised abroad
(2012: € 63.6 million). The decline abroad is primarily caused by
a decline in advertising income and in the sale of single copy
issues. Revenue from subscriptions has remained reasonably
stable. The revenues abroad concern the international activi-
ties of the Keesing Media Group in Denmark, Sweden, Belgium,
France, Spain and Germany. Aside from this, De Telegraaf pri-
marily maintains circulation operations in Southern Europe.

operating expenses

Operating expenses rose by € 13.0 million to € 552.7 million in
2013. One-time restructuring costs in the amount of € 37.0 million
were recognised in 2013 as a result of the initiated cost reduc-
tion programme. Recurring, without exceptional income and ex-
penses, operating expenses declined by € 26.7 million. Due to the
extensive cost reduction programme that by the end of 2014 is
to produce annual cost savings in the amount of € 120 million (in
comparison to 1 January 2012), cost savings have been realised
in all categories.

The costs of raw and auxiliary materials declined by € 3.7 mil-
lion due to the € 1.7 million lower cost of paper and the reduced
circulation of newspapers. By printing Metro using TMG’s print-
ing presses starting in 2013, a large part of the printing capacity
was allocated and the lower newspaper volume was partly offset.
The stock of raw and auxiliary materials maintained at the end of
2013 was valued at € 5.6 million (2012: € 8.8 million).

Pursuant to the announcement made in August 2013 of an addi-
tional 350 FTE reduction, an additional € 37.0 million in restructur-
ing costs was recognised in the fourth quarter. Personnel costs,
excluding restructuring costs, declined by € 8.4 million in 2013.
In 2013, the number of FTEs (including discontinued activities)
declined by 410 FTEs. Excluding discontinued activities, the
number of FTEs declined by 286. Wages, social security contri-
butions and other personnel costs were € 10.5 million lower in
comparison to 2012. By contrast, the cost of temporary agency
personnel rose by € 1.7 million to € 12.6 million. The costs of the
pension schemes rose by € 0.5 million. In 2013, the amended
IAS19 for employee benefits went into effect as a result of which
regular movements are recognised via shareholders’ equity.
In 2012, a supplementary pension guarantee scheme was frozen
for a part of the personnel.

The number of FTEs declined from 2,745 at year-end 2012 to
2,459 at year-end 2013. The decline in the number of FTEs is
evident throughout the Company, but in particular was effected
through means of reduced management, and the integration of
local and regional media, of the free daily newspapers and of the
national media with online activities. Metro and Zoomin Neder-
land were acquired in the second half of 2012 and the activities of
Dichtbij.nl, among others, were expanded.

Other operating expenses declined by € 9.2 million, in spite
of the impact of a full year of operations for Metro and Zoomin.
TV Nederland on the results. The costs of outsourced work de-
clined by € 5.2 million due to the lower circulation of newspa-
pers and magazines, and fewer
video productions. In part due to
the continued integration of busi-
ness operations, fewer employ-
ees and general austerity mea-
sures, automation costs declined

completed. In April 2013, the printing presses in Alkmaar were
fully commissioned with the migration of the regional dailies
to tabloid format. As soon as the presses in Amsterdam are
commissioned, the depreciation charges will show a limited
increase.

Amortisation expenses totalled € 18.1 million in 2013 (2012:
€ 17.9 million). Amortisation expenses normally decline due to
depreciation and impairments. However, in 2013, there was a
change in the accounting estimate for the amortisation period for
the trademarks of Sky Radio and Radio Veronica to 20 years (was
50 years), as a result of which amortisation in 2013 was € 1.9 mil-
lion higher than in 2012.

The result from discontinued operations concerns the sale of
Mobillion and the activities of Keesing Games, among others.
In addition, the operations of Nobiles, Moviebites and Hyves
social network were terminated in the second half of the year.
The Relatieplanet dating site is being held for sale. The net re-
sult, including the write-offs of intangible assets, was negative
€ 42.7 million (2012: negative € 44.7 million) which includes
€ 22.3 million (2012: € 26.6 million) in impairments concern-
ing goodwill and € 6.8 million (2012: € 9.9 million) in relation
to trademark and publishing rights. The effect of the sale of

by € 2.1 million, while housing
costs dropped by € 1.3 million.
Selling costs fell by € 0.8 million
compared to last year. Where in
2012, campaigns were conduct-
ed in the context of the European
Football Championship in Poland
and the Ukraine, and the Olympic
Games, and there was a retention programme for De Telegraaf
daily newspaper subscribers, additional promotion costs in
2013 were primarily related to the Sky Radio Group’s radio sta-
tions (including My Radio) and the iPad promotion of the De
Telegraaf daily newspaper. The cost of sales increased by € 5.8
million primarily due to an increase in e-commerce and the costs
of the iPad promotion. The other general costs decreased by
€ 4.5 million.

Depreciation charges in 2013, in the amount of € 10.6 mil-
lion, are virtually the same as in 2012. In 2014, the conver-
sion of the printing presses at the Amsterdam Campus will be

impairments, including property, plant and equipment, of

million).

The financial income and expenses include TMG’s 6% inter-
est in the ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (ProSiebenSat.1) associate.
The interest is recognised in accordance with the equity meth-
od. A € 12.2 million (2012: € 17.7 million) share in the result of
ProSiebenSat.1 was recognised in 2013. In 2013, the share in the
result was only reported up to 19 August 2013.

During the July General Meeting of Shareholders of ProSieben-
Sat.1, a dividend of € 5.63 (2012: € 1.15) per share was adopted
for the shares with voting rights for 2012. TMG at that time owned
13,127,832 of such shares. The distributed dividend, including
the refund of income tax deducted at source in 2012 (€ 5.5 mil-
lion), amounted to € 66.7 million and was deducted from the value
of TMG’s interest in ProSiebenSat.1. In addition, TMG received
a € 4 million refund of the tax deducted at source over the 2011
dividend.

As at 19 August 2013, the carrying value of TMG’s interest
amounted to € 172.3 million or approximately € 13.12 per share
with voting right.

On 19 August 2013, the shares with voting rights were converted
to listed shares, as a result of which the interest was valued at fair
value (share price) effective from that date. The change in value
is reflected in the consolidated statement of recognised income
and expense. TMG sold the listed shares on 6 September at €

A TOTAL OF € 390.6 MIL

The cash flow from investments in 2013 amounted to € 438.6
million (2012: negative € 34.4 million). The dividend distributed
by ProSiebenSat.1 over the 2012 reporting year was received in
August 2013. Including the refund of the tax deducted at source
for 2011 and 2012, the amount received totalled € 70.7 mil-
lion. The proceeds of the sale of the shares in ProSiebenSat.1
amounted to € 390.6 million. This was offset by investments in the
conversion of the printing presses in Amsterdam, changes to the
facilities of the Sky Radio Group and the acquisition of new soft-
ware by TMG Regional/Local Media and by TMG National Media.
The phased conversion of the printing presses and colour units in
Alkmaar was completed in 2013. The conversion in Amsterdam is.
expected to be completed in 2014.

In 2012, investments amounting to € 19.6 million were made
in new operating activities concerning Metro, Zoomin.TV and
GroupDeal. In addition, the remaining shares held by the man-
agement of Dichtbij.nl were acquired.

The cash flow from financing ac-
tivities was negative € 390.2 mil-
lion (2012: positive € 6.5 million).

30.00 per share. The share price on 6 September was € 30.77
per share. A total of € 390.6 million was received after the deduc-
tion of transaction costs. The realised result on the sale since 19
August amounts to € 218.3 million on the equity interest valued
at fair value.

In September — due to the sale of the interest — Mr F.Th.J. Arp,
TMG’s CFO, stepped down as member of the Supervisory
Board and as a member of the Remuneration Committee of
ProSiebenSat.1.

The tax item in 2013 showed a credit balance of € 5.0 million
(2012: € 4.0 million) on continued operations. The effective tax
burden was -6.8% in 2013 (2012: 48.0%). At year-end 2013, the
tax-offsettable losses amounted to approximately € 91 million.

cash Flow

The net cash flow from operating activities declined by € 37.4
million to € 15.5 million. The redundancy payments of € 34.6 million
were relatively high due to the FTE reduction in 2013 and the other
items of the working capital on balance decreased by € 2.8 million.

shareholders totalling € 301.3 million.
In 2012, a dividend of € 21.8 million
was paid out for the 2011 reporting
year. No TMG shares were repurchased in 2013 (2012: € 2.5 mil-
lion). In 2012, TMG negotiated a new bank financing facility for a
period of 3 years for a total value of € 125 million for the purpose
of financing acquisitions, converting the printing presses and
redeeming the short-term loan with the Rabobank. Of this loan,
€50 million was concluded for three years with interim repayment
obligations. The entire credit facility (including the long-term loan)
was redeemed in the second half of 2013.

The annual FM licence payments by Sky Radio Group in the
amount of € 7.7 million are included under the repayment of long-
term liabilities.

shareholders’ equity

At year-end 2013, shareholders’ equity attributable to the share-
holders of TMG had declined by € 126.0 million to € 298.8 million
in comparison to the previous year, primarily due to the dividend
payment. The net result attributable to the shareholders of TMG
for 2013 amounted to € 177.6 million (2012: negative € 10.6 mil-
lion). In 2013, TMG distributed interim dividends amounting to
€ 301.3 million. In 2012, TMG distributed dividends totalling


--- Page 7 ---

TMG Annual Report 2013

€ 21.8 million for the 2011 reporting year. The shareholders’
equity per share outstanding at year-end 2013 was € 6.45
compared to € 9.16 at 31 December 2012 (after adoption re-
garding IAS19R) .

shares

As at 31 December 2013, there are 46,350,000 ordinary shares
and 960 priority shares of € 0.25 nominal value. Of the ordinary
shares, 28,987,774 had been converted into depositary receipts
as at 31 December 2013, amounting to 62.5% (year-end 2012:
61.2%). No shares were repurchased in 2013. The € 1.4 million in
shares of Telegraaf Media Groep repurchased in previous years
have been withdrawn in accordance with the resolution adopted
by the General Meeting of Shareholders of 25 April 2013.

dividend policy and proposal

In recent years the operating result has been under pressure
due to lower advertising and circulation revenues and high re-
structuring costs. The amount of the dividend was primarily de-
termined by the relatively stable income from puzzle activities
and the receipt of the ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (ProSieben-
Sat.1) net dividend. The interest in ProSiebenSat.1 was sold
in September 2013. Therefore an adjustment in the dividend
policy is needed. Accordingly, a motion will be submitted to
the General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on 24 April re-
questing the shareholders to set the dividend effective from the
2014 financial year dependent on the recurring operating cash
flow, i.e. the recurring EBITDA of the total operations (continued
operations and operations terminated that year) subject to the
deduction of the license fees owed by the Sky Radio Group
(cash out), taxes, interest and the deduction of replacement in-
vestments.

The basic principle will be to pay out 30% - 40% of this net op-
erating cash flow. If this dividend policy had been applied this
past year, the normal dividend payment over 2013 would have
been approximately € 0.30 (excluding the ProSiebenSat.1 re-
sult). In view of the fact that in 2013 an interim dividend amount-
ing to € 6.50 was already paid pursuant to the sale of the par-
ticipation in ProSiebenSat.1 effective in September 2013 and
the dividend received from this participation, and furthermore,
given the high severance payments expected for the coming
financial year, it is proposed that the final dividend payment for
2013 will be passed.

outlook

A further decline in advertising and circulation revenues is ex-
pected for 2014 relative to 2013. This applies to the national as
well as regional daily newspapers due to the structurally changed
market in which media companies operate. Revenues from radio-
related activities are expected to remain stable. Revenues from

17

digital activities are expected to continue to grow. Puzzle activi-
ties are expected to experience a slight decline in revenues.

To tap new growth opportunities, approximately € 5 million will be
invested in digital initiatives in 2014 and an additional budget will
be freed up for a circulation drive for national and regional daily
newspapers. The projected lower revenues are offset by major
cost reductions resulting from the € 120 million cost reduction
programme, of which € 52 million will be realised in 2014/2015.

INFORMATION

corporate affairs

IN 2013 THE ORGANISATION STRUCTURE HAS BEEN CHANGED AND SIMPLIFIED. AFTER AN INTENSIVE EMPLOYEE
PARTICIPATION PROCESS AND A POSITIVE RECOMMENDATION OF THE CENTRAL WORKS COUNCIL, WORK ON
STRUCTURING THE NEW ORGANISATION WAS STARTED. AS AT 1 JANUARY 2014 THE NEW LEGAL STRUCTURE

WAS ALSO COMPLETED.

CLA developments

The first discussions concerning the Framework CLA for the
Publishing Business were held with the trade unions at the end of
2013. The Framework CLA is to replace the Newspaper Publish-
ers CLA, the Newspaper Journalists CLA, the Book and Maga-
zine Publishers CLA, the General Interest Magazine and Opinion
Magazine Journalists CLA and the Trade Journal Journalists
CLA. It is not yet clear whether the Free Local Papers Journalists
CLA will also join the Framework CLA. Negotiations concerning
the content of the Framework CLA will be continued at the begin-
ning of 2014.

In the run-up to the negotiations on the Framework CLA, a num-
ber of CLAs was re-extended in 2013.

The term of the Newspaper Publishers and the Newspaper Jour-
nalists CLA was from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013 in-
clusive. Neither CLA includes a provision for a structural salary
increase. Due to the elimination of the early retirement (VUT) con-
tribution, the net income of employees has improved.

The term of the General Interest Magazine
and Opinion Magazine Journalists CLA was
from 1 April 2013 to 31 December 2013 in-

excessive salaries

Negotiations with the Dutch Association of Journalists and the
Central Works Council (CWC) concerning the issue of excessive
salaries for journalists in 2013 resulted in an agreement concern-
ing the Daily Newspaper Journalists CLA, the General Interest
Magazine and Opinion Magazine Journalists CLA and the Free
Local Papers Journalists CLA. This agreement was implemented
on 1 December 2013.

An appeal was filed on 16 October 2013 in the legal proceedings
instituted by the FNV Kiem and CNV trade unions. The Rota-
tiedrukkerij Voorburgwal Works Council and the Central Works
Council once again joined as parties to this legal action. The rul-
ing is expected over the course of 2014.

employability and new talent

In relation to structuring the new organisation, a great deal of
attention was devoted to assigning employees to new posi-
tions. A lot of time and energy was devoted to the process of
assigning the right employee to the right position on the basis
of development assessments and other means. These develop-

was granted effective 1 July 2013.

Agreement was reached for the Free Local

Papers Journalists CLA at the end of 2013,

thereby extending this CLA up to and including 31 March 2014.
While the CLA does not provide for a salary increase, the elimi-
nation of the early retirement contribution (VUT) for this group of
Telegraaf Media Groep (TMG) employees means that their net
income will improve.

The Grafimedia CLA, which falls outside the Framework CLA,
expired on 1 August 2013. Negotiations with the trade unions
concerning the extension and modernisation of this CLA did not
yet produce any results at year-end 2013.

pension

In recent years pension costs have further increased due to fac-
tors such as the further decline of interest rates and the amend-
ment of the life expectancy tables. Having adjusted the current
pension scheme in a number of areas in recent years, a project
group was initiated in 2013 for the purpose of developing a new
and more modern pension scheme. The basic principles under-
lying the new scheme are affordability in the future, uniformity
within TMG and greater flexibility for employees. Meetings with
the employee representation bodies concerning the new scheme
will commence at the beginning of 2014.

HR projects

Projects designed to make a contribution to professionalising the
HR domain were defined in 2013. These projects contribute to
further simplification and cost reductions. The projects are pri-
marily concerned with the terms and conditions of employment
and job profiles.

report of the Central Works Council
(CWC)

There was a turnaround within Telegraaf Media Groep (TMG)
this past year. At the beginning of 2013, work was proceed-
ing at full tilt on the implementation of a change programme
under the leadership of the CEO at that time. The CWC clearly
expressed its hesitation about these plans at the time. In mid-
April 2013, there was a change in executive management and
interim CEO Cees van Steijn was appointed. A programme was
developed within a short period of time in which the brands
and the journalistic relevance, rather than the publishing plat-
forms, were once again given priority. Since the beginning, the
CWC has supported the new top executive Cees van Steijn in
his resolve to also limit the number of management layers and
to simplify the organisation structure.

The organisation that has largely been implemented by the end
of 2013 enables the Group to act more decisively. And this is
sorely needed. TMG cannot continue to reorganise and intro-
duce cost reductions without tapping new revenues on a large
scale as well. The preference is for this latter to be effected by
our own organisation and with the already existing portfolio.
However, if necessary, resources for making acquisitions are
also available. The CWC will continue to critically review any
future acquisitions.

In 2013, the Group had to let go of hundreds of employees;
most through internal reorganisations and several tens of
employees through the disposal of business units. Major re-

19

structuring plans are still on the agenda for 2014 as well.
The CWC considers it of major importance that employees
are well trained so that they can find suitable work elsewhere
— preferably internally, but if this is not possible, externally.
For employees forced to leave the Company, the CWC consid-
ers a good social plan that is consistent with TMG as a good
employer, indispensable.

2014 must primarily become a year of entrepreneurship.
The Company has focused inwards for too long and, until re-
cently, the number of management layers only kept increasing.
The CWC considers it very important that promising initiatives
and entrepreneurship are given room; this is the only way for
TMG to become the leading media enterprise of the future.

In addition to all the changes implemented within TMG, there
were changes within the CWC as well. Ans Kramp, Chairman
since 2004, left the CWC and TMG. John Hagens took over the
reins. A number of experienced members also left the CWC.
The CWC would like to thank everyone for their employee par-
ticipation efforts and wishes John Hagens lots of success!

NATIONAL MEDIA

TELEGRAAF MEDIA GROEP IS MAINLY FOCUSED ON STRENGTHENING ITS KEY BRANDS AND ITS EXPLOITATION
OF THESE BRANDS. DUTCH CONSUMERS ARE REACHED VIA PRINT, ONLINE, VIDEO, MOBILE AND RADIO. WHICH
CHANNELS ARE USED WHEN IS NOT RELEVANT. THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS IS DONE IS MUCH MORE IMPOR-
TANT. THE BRANDS AND THEIR JOURNALISTIC RELEVANCE ARE THE HEART OF THE COMPANY. IN THE MEDIA
BUSINESS OF THE FUTURE, THE KEY WILL BE THE COMBINATION OF BRAND AND CONTENT AND THE ADDED
VALUE THAT THIS PROVIDES TO CONSUMERS AND ADVERTISERS.

By extension of this, various national print and online brands
and activities of Telegraaf Media Groep (TMG) were integrated
into TMG National Media over the course of 2013. The emphasis
in this business unit therefore was on the implementation of a
new organisation structure and, in addition, on the development
of a programme in support of the additional cost reductions of
approximately 50 million announced by TMG in August 2013
that are to be implemented by the end of 2014. A key part of
these savings will have to be realised by TMG National Media
due to the declining revenue from print activities, which, as it
was in previous years, continued to be under pressure as a re-
sult of structural as well as economic cyclical trends.

Based on the order of the basic underlying principles: inspiring
and prompting - reaching - capitalising, TMG National Media
was divided into three main components after the organisational
change, namely the Editorial Board, the Consumer Market and
the Business-to-Business Market. The national editorial board is
responsible for the journalistic content of the various brands on
the various platforms. Within the Consumer Market component,
the brand managers are responsible for the further development
of the brands and products, increasing the reach and targeting
the consumer markets. Within Commerce — which is the central
point for the sale of advertisements for the national products
— several advertising sales departments have since been inte-
grated.

The advertising revenues of TMG National Media decreased by
€ 10.9 million (-13.0%) in 2013. Subscription revenues decreased
by € 5.6 million (-4.2%) due to the fact that price increases did not
fully offset the decline in circulation. The decrease in the sale of
single copy issues was limited to € 2.2 million (-6.6%) in part due
to the many news items related to the Royal House and showbiz.
Digital income rose by € 4.4 million (8.4%) due to the growth in
digital advertising revenues and revenues from e-commerce. The
later in spite of the termination of various activities. The growth in
digital revenues was however insufficient to offset the decline in
print. On balance, revenues decreased by € 14.5 million (-4.7%).

daily newspaper market

In the consumer market, the Dutch daily newspapers are repre-
sented by products that are different in nature, scope and publi-
cation frequency and that are furthermore segmented by region
and by free or paid newspapers. The Dutch circulation market in
2013 (fourth quarter 2012 to third quarter 2013, inclusive) con-
sisted of approximately 3.75 million copies per day, a decline of
6.5% (source: HOl).

The overall circulation of paid Dutch daily newspapers in 2013
(fourth quarter 2012 to third quarter 2013, inclusive) declined by
4.9% to 3.1 million copies per day (2012: 4.1% decline and 3.2
million copies). The paid national daily newspapers declined by
4.6% (2012: 3.4%) and the regional daily newspapers by 5.2%
(2012: 4.9%) (source: HOl).

Within the Dutch net advertising market, the portion related to
daily newspapers declined by 15.4% to € 425 million in 2012
(2011: € 502 million). There was a decrease of 16.7% in the first
half of 2013 in comparison to the same period in the previous
year. It is estimated that the advertising market declined by 18%
to € 348 million in 2013 (source: Nielsen).

De Telegraaf

The declining trend in revenues experienced by the advertising
and circulation market for daily newspapers print titles persisted
in 2013. Advertising revenues of the De Telegraaf daily newspa-
per declined by € 13.5 million (-22.6%) in comparison to 2012.
Subscription revenues declined slightly (-4.2%) and revenues
from single copy sales stayed virtually the same.

De Telegraaf Editorial Board

The De Telegraaf’s editorial board, which also covers the brands
Privé, Vrouw, Autovisie, DFT, and Telesport, last year reinforced
the synergy between the different media types print, online and
video. Reporters and editors increasingly more often develop
story lines for several of these platforms. An additional dimension
in this respect is that since November 2018, certain parts of the
content of Telegraaf.nl are only available as paid content. A key
step in realising online income from the consumer market and the
movement towards working ‘web first’. The rollout of the Telegraaf

Video 2.0 Project was accompanied by the start-up of an initia-
tive designed to further professionalise editorial online video.
The latter had resulted in significantly higher viewing figures, and
perhaps just as important, significantly longer viewing times.

The 2013 news year started off with the announcement of
Queen Beatrix’ abdication. The period up to the investiture of
Crown Prince Willem-Alexander resulted in considerably thicker
newspapers and a number of historical commemorative issues.

2014 is and will be a challenging year, most definitely for the edito-
rial board. First, the Sochi Olympic Winter Games were reported
24 hours per day in text, picture and sound. In addition to the
regular newspaper pages, online videos were produced several
times per day for Telesport.nl. The videos contained items such
as the latest news, interpretation by our own experts and inter-
views with the leading players and medallists. These programmes
were also broadcasted via television by Fox Sport Centraal thanks
to the collaboration with Fox Sports. Three sports bulletins were
broadcasted every day by Radio Veronica. In addition, Telesport
set up its own online radio
station, Telesport Radio, that
broadcasted the latest news
framed with music that listeners
could adapt to their own tastes
(personalised online radio). Fur-
thermore, the ‘Premium Sochi
Edition’ was published in the
De Telegraaf HD app for tablet
and smartphone each evening
for paying readers. This edition
each day covered the back-
ground stories, columns and a
portrait of a sports hero, ‘the
day in pictures’ and ‘the day
tomorrow’. With all of these options, sports enthusiasts did not
need to miss anything and everyone always had a front row seat.

The conversion of the printing presses in Amsterdam will be
completed in 2014, after which there will be more colour op-
tions available for the De Telegraaf daily newspaper in particular.
This provides greater editorial as well as commercial options.
As a result, TMG was recently able to announce that the De
Telegraaf, in terms of its paper edition, would be migrating to the
smaller tabloid format in the fourth quarter of 2014. The tabloid
format is half the size of the current broadsheet format. Parts of
the newspaper were already being printed in the new format for
some time, but the rest of the newspaper will now follow suit.

In addition, TMG recently announced that the De Telegraaf will
be publishing a digital Sunday edition. This edition will first be

published on Sunday, 27 April. The De Telegraaf had a printed
Sunday newspaper from 2004 to 2009, but was forced to termi-
nate its publication due to high printing and distribution costs.

De Telegraaf Circulation

The circulation of the printed version of the De Telegraaf in 2013
(source HOI; measured during the fourth quarter 2012 to the
third quarter 2013, inclusive) on average was 544,000 copies
per day compared to 596,000 copies per day a year earlier.
The 8.7% decline was higher than the average decline of 4.9%
experienced by the overall paid dailies market. As such the De
Telegraaf’s share of the market for paid subscriptions fell from
18.5% in 2012 to 17.8% in 2013.

A positive trend is the strong growth in the number of weekend
subscriptions, although that increase naturally is partly at the ex-
pense of the number of weekly subscriptions. Another positive
development was the start-up of the sale of two-year subscrip-
tions combined with the delivery of an iPad in the fourth quarter
of 2013.

REALISING ONLINE INCOME
FROM CONSUMER MARKET
IS IMPORTANT TOWARDS
WORKING ‘WEB FIRST’

Due to the migration of print to (free) digital news platforms,
the printed circulation of paid dailies in general have been un-
der pressure for some time. The persisting economic crisis has
hit the circulation of the De Telegraaf especially hard in 2013.
Consumers continued to be extremely cautious last year and
generally kept their hands on their purse strings. In comparison
to other national newspapers, the De Telegraaf has significantly
more subscribers that also subscribe to a regional daily newspa-
per. This is why the De Telegraaf is harder hit than other national
daily newspapers in terms of consumer cutbacks on newspaper
spending. The broad availability of WiFi combined with the strong
growth in the number of persons owning a tablet has furthermore
resulted in a significant drop in single copy sales abroad.

The De Telegraaf’s subscription rates were on average increased
by 3.2% effective 1 July 2013.


--- Page 13 ---

TMG Annual Report 2013

At year-end 2013, more than half of Dutch residents 13 years
and older had a tablet and two in three persons had a smart-
phone. The De Telegraaf anticipates this trend with news, en-
tertainment and replica apps for tablets and smartphones, with
an increased focus on paid access. All of the De Telegraaf’s
news apps are now available for the Android operating system
as well.

In addition to free content, the De Telegraaf also introduced pre-
mium content on its digital news platforms in the fourth quarter
of 2013. Part of the articles on its website or accessible via the
app is exclusively available to (digital) subscribers or at a daily
fee. New and flexible subscription and payment forms are being
investigated and tested with an eye on maintaining customer
relations.

The De Telegraaf in 2013 naturally devoted a great deal of at-
tention to the abdication of Queen Beatrix and the investiture
of Crown Prince Willem-Alexander. To be able to demonstrate
their solidarity with the new royal couple, almost a million De
Telegraaf readers received an Appeltje van Oranje pin. Premier
Rutte was the first person to have the pin pinned on.

The De Telegraaf published an exclusive investiture book on the
occasion of the crowning. ‘Op de Troon’ (On the Throne) went
across the counter on almost 12,000 occasions.

An archive app was launched on the occasion of the De
Telegraaf’s 120th anniversary. All of the De Telegraaf’s editions
that have been published since it first appeared on 1 January
1893, can be downloaded via this app. The app consequently
provides access to almost 40,000 complete newspapers, in to-
tal comprising more than 1 million pages. During the year of its
anniversary, the De Telegraaf, for the benefit of its subscribers,
successfully collaborated with a number of other companies cel-
ebrating their anniversary. This and other promotions once again
clearly demonstrated the De Telegraaf’s power of response.

De Telegraaf Advertising market

Several advertising sales departments were integrated into
TMG National Media’s Commerce department this past year.
This department is responsible for the central advertising sales
for national brands. The objective of this integrated sales organ-
isation is to operate with a maximum customer-oriented focus
and with a focus on cross-media and multimedia propositions.
The sales organisation is subdivided into segments, whereby
print and digital are integrated. At the time of the integration,
the department was also reorganised in order to lower the total
costs of the sales organisation. Initiatives such as self-service,
automated trading and the standardisation and simplification of
processes are to contribute to lowering sales costs.

23

There is a perceptible growth of video, mobile and tablets within
the online products advertising market. In addition, there is a
shift of revenues from standard display to automated trading.

digital media

National net media spending on the internet in 2012 amounted
to approximately € 1,158 million (2011: € 1,068 million). The size
of the market in the first half of 2013 amounted to € 619 million
(first half of 2012: € 585 million). It is estimated that spending
increased to approximately € 1.2 billion for the full year in 2013
(source: Nielsen).

The internet market is subdivided as follows: Search, Display
and a Classifieds, Directories and Listings category. Over half of
media spending on the internet falls within the Search category.
That market accounted for € 625 million in 2012 and is projected
to continue to grow to € 675 million in 2013. The Display mar-
ket declined from € 338 million in 2012 to € 331 million in 2013.
The Classifieds, Directories and Listings category accounted for
€ 195 million in 2012 and is projected to decline to € 187 million
in 2013 (source: Nielsen). The growth in net media spending on
the internet in 2103 was therefore limited to the Search category.

The digital revenues of TMG National Media, including video pro-
ductions, increased from almost € 52.3 million in 2012 to € 56.7
million in 2013. Especially e-Commerce realised a strong growth
in revenues.

Telegraaf.nl & channels

Telegraaf.nl has had a successful year. In spite of the shift in
use from fixed to mobile internet, Telegraaf.nl is also managing
to maintain, as well as grow, its reach to the desktop. The daily
reach has risen to an average of almost 1.5 million unique visi-
tors per day versus 1.4 million unique visitors per day in 2012.

In 2013, almost 185 million videos were retrieved via desktops
versus 110 million in 2012. Total viewing time has risen from 128
million minutes in 2012 to almost 167 million minutes in 2013.
The rise in video viewing time via mobile devices at plus 78% to
228 million viewing minutes is perhaps even more impressive.
The tripling of in-house video productions in part lies at the basis
of this success.

A strong growth is also evident in all respects on the mobile
internet for the De Telegraaf’s sites and apps. For example, the
number of pages retrieved from the mobile website has dou-
bled and the site now has more than 1.8 million active users.
The number of downloads of the renewed iPhone and iPad apps
is also impressive. Various apps were launched in 2013 for the


--- Page 14 ---

Android operating system, for smartphones, as well as tablets.
This means that the De Telegraaf’s complete digital bundle
is now accessible to Apple as well as Android users. The De
Telegraaf has since launched an app for Windows 8 as well.

Metro and Spits

The total circulation of free national daily newspapers in the
Netherlands in 2013 (fourth quarter 2012 to third quarter 2013,
inclusive) consisted of approximately 0.7 million copies per day,
a decline of 13% compared to 2012 (source: HOl).

Following TMG’s takeover of Metro in 2012, 2013 was devoted
to integrating the Metro organisation. Various projects were
initiated in order to achieve the maximum possible synergy.
The synergy proved to be greater than expected, especially
from a cost perspective. Effective February, the entire Metro
print order was brought in-house to TMG’s own printers and
Metro is now being distributed by TMG Distributie.

To reduce the overlap between Metro and Splts readers, work
on repositioning both daily newspapers was initiated in Febru-
ary by adjusting the formulas and the distribution. Sp!ts now
focuses more on the target group interested in entertainment
and Metro more on the target group interested in regional and

EXPECTED

‘hard’ news. In addition, new products were launched, such as
Metro Mode and Wonen. Following a period of close collabora-
tion between the two editorial boards, a decision was taken in
the summer of 2013 to establish a joint editorial board. In ad-
dition to job savings, this has also resulted in an efficient and
effective journalistic organisation. All other Metro departments
were integrated into the various TMG departments on a phased
basis, or were closed down. The full integration was completed
in December.

magazines

The Dutch advertising market for general interest magazines has
experienced some very difficult years. The market fell from € 258
million in 2011 to € 223 million in 2012 and is estimated to continue
to drop to approximately € 192 million in 2013 (source: Nielsen).

VROUW

In addition to the pages in the newspaper, the glossy weekly
magazine VROUW and Vrouw.n! were also published under the
Vrouw (Woman) brand. The focus of the VROUW brand remains
on optimal reporting across the various publishing platforms.
Due to the decline in circulation of the De Telegraaf, the reach of
VROUW Magazine fell by 9% to 1,362,000 readers per week in
2013. VROUW has built up a permanent reader base of satisfied
readers over a period of 5.5 years. In terms of reach, VROUW
is in third place in the weekly women’s magazine segment.
Compared to 2012, 24% fewer advertising pages are placed in
weekly women’s magazines (cumulative to November, inclusive).
At a cumulative decrease of 19%, VROUW is performing better
than average (source: NMR).

In 2013, combined De Telegraaf newspaper and VROUW
Glossy magazine subscriptions were offered for the first time.
The result is that the number of
VROUW Glossy subscriptions
has more than doubled. As a
result of the positive VROUW
Glossy results, the magazine
will be expanded from four to
six editions per year in 2014.
This will give the glossy more of
a permanent face among maga-
zines in the single copy sales
market. The events VROUW in
Concert and VROUW Weekend
for Women were repeated with
success.

Privé

Due to the many events related to the Dutch and other roy-
al houses and show business, single copy sales showed a
better trend than expected. A special additional edition was
published on the occasion of Queen Beatrix’ abdication.
This Royal Edition went on to become the best sold edition in
2013. The General Interest Magazines Group (GPT), which has
been awarding the Mercurs Quality Award in the general in-
terest magazines sector in the Netherlands since 1998, nomi-
nated Privé’s Royal Edition for the ‘Magazine Reporting of the
Year 2013’ award.


--- Page 15 ---

TMG Annual Report 2013

The total circulation of Dutch gossip magazines in 2013 (fourth
quarter 2012 to third quarter 2013) declined by 6.7%. Privé out-
performed the market with a decline in circulation of 4.4% (source:
HO)). Privé’s reach declined by 3% in relation to the previous NOM
measurement (2011-2012) to an average of 1,371,000 readers per
edition and as such outperformed the market, which fell by 5%.

In 2013, a Privé app was launched that now makes it possible
to read Privé in digital format as well. The app has been down-
loaded 21,000 times since August 2013.

Autovisie

The total circulation of Dutch automotive magazines in 2013
(fourth quarter 2012 to third quarter 2013) fell by 6.5%. Autovisie
outperformed the market with a decline in circulation of 5.9%
(source: HOI). The magazine, as well as the website and the pag-
es in the De Telegraaf are exploited under the Autovisie brand.
In 2013, various events were organised, including the Nationale
Auto8Daagse (National 8-Day Automotive Media Event), which
saw its first début this year.

other national brands and activities

GroupDeal

GroupDeal is a promotion-based e-commerce platform that of-
fers products and services of advertisers and brands at attrac-
tive prices. GroupDeal was initiated at the beginning of 2010
and has since then experienced strong growth. Revenues al-
most doubled in 2013. As such GroupDeal is TMG’s fastest
growing business unit. GroupDeal achieved a high growth in
yield in 2013 and is expected to experience strong growth in
2014 as well. TMG has a 60% interest in GroupDeal B.V. with
the option of acquiring 100%.

E-commerce

Activities conducted via webshops have grown rapidly in re-
cent years; however yield has lagged. In 2013, it was decided
to apply greater focus as a result of which the Heimweewin-

25

kel and A&C sieraden webshops were divested. This puts the
focus on a smaller segment primarily involving promotion-
based products. Revenues declined somewhat as a result of
constraining operations. To achieve a better cost/revenue ra-
tio, cost reductions were implemented in 2013, including the
downsizing of the involved e-commerce team.

Upcoming

The new title Upcoming.nl was successfully launched at the
beginning of 2013. Upcoming gathers the most popular im-
ages, videos and tweets and other in-
ternet trends to create its own lists.
Using this format, Upcoming has grown
to 750,000 unique visitors per month
under its own strength. Last summer,
Upcoming also launched an Android
and iPhone app, which has since been
downloaded over 50,000 times. In Au-
gust, a revenue model related to native
advertising was initiated involving the
publication of lists sponsored by brands.
In addition, a pilot was initiated with a
German version of the site. The innovative technology under-
pinning Upcoming was developed by the Hyves Product Devel-
opment Team and has since been used for other TMG titles as
well. The development team was added to TMG National Media
and has since been working on the further development of TMG
National Media’s digital products and brands and on the devel-
opment of new products.

Hyves Games

Hyves Games has also been integrated into TMG National Media.
Hyves Games started out as part of the Hyves social network,
which was closed down at the end of 2013 due to the strongly
deteriorating results. In 2013, Hyves Games negotiated agree-
ments with key game developers, as a result of which it is no
longer dependent on the external party with whom it was collabo-
rating. The average number of unique visitors is around 400,000
per month, putting Hyves Games among the top gaming portals
in the Netherlands. Another gaming portal was launched on and
in collaboration with Vrouw.nl in 2013.

Bohil Media

The persisting poor market conditions were responsible for a
further decline in media spending in the boating and camping
segment in 2013. Revenues and the result have declined in spite
of the fact that the broad portfolio of magazines, sites and a tele-
vision programme have increased reach. Bohil Media's strategy
is focused on further reinforcing and expanding its market lead-
ership position in the water sport and camping market.

AutoTeKoop.nl

Autotekoop.nl met expectations for the past year and devoted
effort to the further organisational and technical integration with
Gaspedaal.nl.

Gaspedaal.nl

Gaspedaal.nl experienced stable growth in terms of visitors.
Gaspedaal at the end of the year launched a new business
model that is unique to the automotive market: the option of
purchasing advertisements on
the basis of click listings on the
site. The initial results from the
implementation of this model are
promising.

Jaap.nl and Huizenzoeker.nl
In spite of the fact that the resi-
dential market remained bogged
down in 2013, Jaap.nl has experi-
enced a year in which visitor num-
bers stayed the same and revenue
rose considerably. The Jaap.nl
proposition ‘Sell Your Own Home’
has grown to such an extent that it has since become a more im-
portant source of income than advertising revenue.

Speurders.nl

Speurders.nl successfully completed the redevelopment of its
platform in 2013 and has started to roll out new business mod-
els. Revenue from the Speurders.nl ‘daily offers platform’ has
risen and has since become responsible for a significant part of
the revenues. Furthermore, Speurders.nl has launched its own
auction platform and a platform for second hand clothing.

News Media

The GeenStijl brand celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2013.
In their own words, ‘news facts, scandalous revelations and
journalistic investigations appear interchangeably with airy top-
ics and slightly eccentric nonsense’ on GeenStijl. GeenStijl was
among the top 10 most often visited news sites in the Neth-
erlands in 2013. Dumpert, after YouTube, is the largest Dutch
video platform. The number of video views on this site continued
to grow in 2013. The significant growth in mobile use stands
out in this respect. In total, Dumpert’s apps (IOS and Android)
were downloaded more than 2 million times. The young Glam-
orama entertainment title achieved healthy growth in reach and
revenues. In addition, a new business title, Das Kapital, was
launched in 2013. The initial feedback received from this initia-
tive is positive.

GAMING PORTALS IN THE

Video/TV Production

In 2013, Telegraaf Video Media merged the production houses
Telegraaf Video Media and Pylarczyk Mediagroep, while Mov-
iebites’ activities were divested. The volume of video material
produced for television and online use continued to increase
in 2013. The viewing figures for the television programme
‘Vandaag de Dag’ (The Day Today)’ stayed the same in 2013 and
its customer, the public broadcaster WNL, was satisfied with
the result. Unfortunately, WNL decided to produce the weekly

Aside from this, for instance the Fix this Kitchen programme was.
produced for the third season. Video productions for Telegraaf.
nl rose sharply: 60% of the video content on this site is in-house
productions. The De Telegraaf’s editorial board uses increas-
ingly more videos which are partly produced at the studio of
Telegraaf Video Media, and partly at the studio located on the
editorial department.

TMG REGIONAL/
LOCAL MEDIA

Work on the formation of the TMG Regional and Local Media
segment started in 2013. The cluster consolidates the regional
dailies (HDC Media B.V.), the free local papers (distributed door-
to-door) (Holland Combinatie B.V.) and the local website (Dichtbij
B.V.). The back-offices of these companies were integrated over
the course of the year, and the local editorial boards and sales
were transformed into a single organisation. Holland Combinatie
and HDC Media now serve customers from their joint product
portfolio. The portfolio consists of the dailies and the free local
papers, specials, theme pages, magazines, websites, apps, trade
fairs, activities for third parties and events. In 2014, HDC Media
and Holland Combinatie were legally merged into a single com-
pany operating under the name Holland Media Combinatie B.V.
The integration of Dichtbij into this new company is a key step
in further growth in a future in which print and the internet will
become increasingly interwoven.

Anew advertising system has since been implemented as a re-
placement of four separate information system; this is resulting
in cost savings. With the flexibility of a web-based system, the
company is now ready for the future.

regional daily newspapers

The total daily circulation of regional daily newspapers in the
Netherlands in 2013 (fourth quarter 2012 to third quarter 2013,
inclusive) declined by 5.3% (2012:
4.6%) (source: HOl). The total adver-
tising volume of regional daily news-
papers in the Netherlands declined by
15% in 2013 (source: ASS).

TMG Regionale/Lokale Media’s re-
gional daily newspapers (Noordhol-
lands Dagblad, Haarlems Dagblad,
lJmuider Courant, Leidsch Dagblad,
De Gooi- en Eemlander and Almere
Vandaag) experienced a clear decline
in revenues in 2018, primarily caused
by a drop in advertising revenues.
The number of paid subscriptions de-
creased by 4.4% (2012: 5.2%). It was
not possible to fully offset the loss of
subscription income through means of an increase in subscrip-
tion rates and the acquisition of promotional subscriptions.

The necessary personnel reduction among the editorial boards
of the daily newspapers occurred without forced redundan-
cies. In spite of this further reduction in personnel and other

cost reductions, it proved impossible to prevent a significant
decline in the result. The organisation’s result trend requires
the implementation of strong cost control measures in 2014
as well.

The regional daily newspapers of Holland Media Combinatie
switched to the more compact tabloid format in April 2013,
requiring the formula and production to be adjusted accord-
ingly. The target set for acquiring new subscribers during the
transition to a tabloid were amply met and the acquisition of
new subscribers continues to be successful. In the meantime,
new subscription propositions have also been formulated that
involve the offer of a mix of print and digital with premium con-
tent. The number of subscribers who receive the printed news-
paper once a week and the digital version on remaining days
is steadily increasing. An acquisition campaign was initiated at
the end of 2013, coupled with a longer than usual, two-year,
subscription period. The subscription comes with an iPad. The
two-year subscription period gives the publisher time to build up
and reinforce its relationship with the subscriber. In the area of
e-commerce, the tests with premium items on the website of the
Haarlems Dagblad were successful. It was decided to roll out
this approach on a phased basis to the other daily newspaper
websites.

The website GerichtopPrint.nl (Focused on Print) was launched
on the advertising market in the context of customer loyalty in

the first quarter of 2013. This service enables advertisers to eas-
ily create and modify their own internet advertisements.

The Alphen.cc title was a compact and comprehensive newspa-
per whose yield significantly lagged forecasts due to the crisis
and market trends in 2013. Originally this title was reduced from

four to three publication days with the objective of realising a
structural improvement in the result. However, it was concluded
that the latter is nowhere in sight, after which it was decided to
shut down the Alphen.cc’s operations.

Effective in January 2013, the Associated Press Services (GPD),
the news agency for regional dailies, closed its doors. After al-
most eighty years, the curtain finally fell on this partnership. In
terms of national copy, the dailies will now be supplied by We-
gener’s Press Office.

free local papers (distributed door-
to-door)

In spite of an important drop in advertising revenues, the recur-
ring result of the free local papers (distributed door-to-door) is
significantly higher than last year due to clear production and
personnel cost reductions. The drop in advertising income ap-
plies to the entire free local papers market. The negative mar-
ket trends and the crisis have a direct impact on spending by
advertisers, but are especially evident in the revenues of non-
national advertisers. The result of free local papers unfortunately
is remaining negative, as a consequence of which further cost
reductions will also be necessary in 2014.

The product portfolio in the large urban areas (Amsterdam,
Rotterdam and Utrecht) was adjusted. Holland Combinatie’s
editorial board is now intensively working together with
Dichtbij.nl’s editorial board and is working in accordance with
the ‘web first’ principle.

Dichtbij.nl

Dichtbij.nl is the Telegraaf Media Groep’s local online platform
and works in close collaboration with the free local papers
(distributed door-to-door) of TMG Regional and Local Media.
Dichtbij helps people achieve their local objectives and offers
opportunities for communicating on matters they consider rel-
evant. Dichtbij.nl, in addition to local news, also contains go-
ing out tips and events, restaurants, job openings and available
homes. Dichtbij’s strength is that the local resident or entre-
preneur can participate by entering news, photos or feedback
on the site him/herself. Dichtbij.nl operates throughout the
Netherlands. The core regions are located in the provinces of
Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland, Utrecht, Flevoland and Brabant.
In Maastricht and several other cities in the Province of Limburg
Dichtbij is published by local entrepreneurs on the basis of a
franchise-like concept. Dichtbij.nl’s internet website, as well as
its mobile versions were completely revamped and new rev-
enue models were introduced in 2013. The key to increased
engagement and a growing number of display pages is and re-
mains the hyper-local news.

Dichtbij.nl’s reach rose by 25% in 2013. Revenue grew by 32%
and personnel and other costs were reduced by 10%. On bal-
ance, the result in 2013 still remained slightly negative, but there
was significant improvement in comparison to 2012

SKY RADIO
GROUP

29

IN SPITE OF THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, A RECOVERY WAS EVIDENT ON THE DUTCH RADIO ADVERTISING MAR-
KET IN 2013. AT A SIZE OF ALMOST € 227 MILLION, THE RADIO ADVERTISING MARKET GREW BY 2.3% COMPARED
TO 2012 WHEN THE ADVERTISING MARKET WAS € 222 MILLION IN SIZE (SOURCE: RADIO ADVIES BUREAU).

Sky Radio Group (SRG) is the largest commercial radio com-
pany in the Netherlands in terms of market share and reach with
popular radio stations such as Sky Radio, Radio Veronica, Clas-
sic FM, various online radio stations and MyRadio. In spite of
the arrival of a new competitor on the airwaves at the old ‘Ar-
row Classic Rock’ FM lot, SRG has managed to achieve a good
result in the listening market in 2013. SRG on average reached
5,124,000 Dutch residents per week in 2013; this is an increase
of 5% in relation to the year before. The market share in the ‘10
years and older’ target group was 17.3% in 2013 (2012: 17.0%)
and in the commercially important ‘20 to 49 years’ target group
SRG achieved an almost stable result with a 19.2% market
share (2012: 20.3%) (source: NLO/Intomart GfK, January 2013 -
November 2013, inclusive).

SRG’s advertising revenue rose by 13% to € 40 million in 2013.
With this increase, SRG has outperformed the radio advertising
market, with a higher market share as a result.

Sky Radio has continued to rejuvenate its music mix in 2013 and
has aligned its marketing focus accordingly.

Radio Veronica was repositioned in the listening market in 2013.
The listening market share and the reach were under pressure
in 2013 due to the increased competition. The station has intro-
duced a refined music mix with greater variation and has been

given an adjusted DJ line-up. In addition, the design was ad-
justed and the branding was refreshed.

2013 was a successful year for Classic FM. Classic FM mod-
ernised its programming in 2013 and achieved a positive result.

MyRadio, the first radio station in the Netherlands to complete-
ly attunes itself to its listeners’ wishes, completed its first full
year of operations. The technical development of MyRadio was
continued in 2013 and a large-scale promotional campaign was
held at the end of November 2013.

In 2013, the commercial stations collectively began broadcast-
ing their programmes via DAB+. This was part of the agreement
negotiated by the government when the FM licenses were ex-
tended. In addition to Sky Radio and Radio Veronica, SRG also
broadcasts Classic FM programmes and a seasonally adjusted
Sky Radio programme via DAB+.

Radio Veronica in 2011 received an FM license, whereby ob-
jections were immediately raised against the level of the FM
license fee. In legal proceedings initiated by SRG, the court
ruled against Radio Veronica. SRG has lodged an appeal
against the ruling. The expectation is that the Trade and In-
dustry Appeals Tribunal will hear the appeal in 2014. A ruling is
only expected in 2015.

KEESING MEDIA

GROUP

THE TELEGRAAF MEDIA GROEP (TMG) REVIEWED THE AVAILABLE STRATEGIC OPTIONS FOR THE KEESING MEDIA
GROUP (KMG) THIS PAST YEAR. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME IT IS BEST FOR KMG, AS WELL
AS TMG, THAT IT CONTINUES TO OPERATE UNDER TMG’S WING. TMG WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT KMG’S STRAT-
EGY, FOUNDED ON INTERNATIONAL GROWTH AND CONTINUED DIGITISATION.

The European magazines market in general has been under
pressure for some time, but developments in the puzzle mar-
ket continue to be relatively stable. KMG’s revenues from single
copy sales in the Netherlands, as well as in other key countries
slightly declined last year, primarily due to the economic crisis
and a drop in the number of sales outlets. KMG considers itself
well-positioned to be able to withstand the challenging market
conditions in the consumer print market. Market share is pro-
jected to show further growth over the coming years and signifi-
cant cost reduction measures will be implemented.

In France, Sport Cérébral’s market share rose, while Mega-
star’s market share declined somewhat. The joint market share
remained the same at approximately 70%. Because the French
market is more attractive for puzzle magazines than the market for
general magazines, several large publishers came out with a num-
ber of new puzzle titles in 2013. This put KMG’s result in France
somewhat under pressure in 2013. The expectation is that this
phenomenon will be of a temporary nature. In mid-2013, an agree-
ment was reached with the trade unions in France, concerning
the closure of KMG’s printing plant in Naintré at the end of March
2014. From that time onward, all of Megastar’s printing will be out-
sourced, which is expected to result in considerable cost savings.

Keesing Nederland experienced a decline in single copy sales,
while Denksport’s market share improved somewhat. As a re-

sult of trends on the magazine market, not only the number of
sales outlets declined; some supermarket chains reduced the
available magazine shelf space, which had a negative effect on
the sale of puzzle magazines. Keesing Nederland’s result con-
sequently decreased in 2013. To restore return, a reorganisation
was implemented at the end of 2013. At KMG the number of
jobs decreased by 18 FTEs due to continued digitisation and
process optimisation.

Revenues in Belgium stayed up to par until the last quarter, but
the last months of 2013 were disappointing so that total rev-
enues nevertheless declined slightly. Revenues in Spain and
Germany increased due to the expansion of the portfolios. Be-
cause of the associated start-up costs, the positive effects on
the result will only be evident at a later stage.

The offer of digital tablet products was significantly expanded in
2013 to include almost all puzzle segments and nine languages.
An expansion to include Android and Windows 8 is planned for
2014. The sales and associated revenues showed a positive
trend and the revenue and profitability projections are positive
for the longer term.

Keesing Games was sold at the end of 2013, because the type
of games (dexterity) was not consistent with KMG’s puzzle
games.

FACILITATING
SERVICES AND ICT

FACILITAIR BEDRIJF WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2013 FOR THE PURPOSE OF CARRYING OUT ALL ACTIVITIES IN SUP-
PORT OF THE PUBLISHERS AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. IN ORDER TO SERVE THE TMG INTEREST, FACILITAIR
BEDRIJF MANAGES THE PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION AND THE INTERNAL SHARED SERVICES ON A STRATE-
GIC, TACTICAL AND OPERATIONAL LEVEL. TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY WITHIN THE DIFFERENT BUSINESS UNITS
AND DEPARTMENTS IT WAS DECIDED TO REDUCE THE SEPARATE MANAGEMENT BOARDS AND TO MANAGE THE
COMPANIES, TELEGRAAF DRUKKERIJ GROEP, TMG DISTRIBUTIE, THE SHARED SERVICE CENTRE AND THE CHAIN
COORDINATION DEPARTMENT, DIRECTLY FROM THE FACILITAIR BEDRIJF’S MANAGEMENT BOARD.

Telegraaf Drukkerij Groep (TDG)

The conversion of the printing presses at the Drukkerij Noord-
holland was completed in 2013 and this printing plant now has
access to nine printing towers and three folding machines, that
are used to print 100% full-colour. The Holland Media Combina-
tie dailies have been printed in tabloid format since April 2013.
The conversion of the printing presses at the Rotatiedrukkerij
Voorburgwal in Amsterdam is on schedule and will be completed
according to plan by the end of 2014. At that time this printing
plant will have 23 printing towers and 7 folding machines that are
also capable of printing 100% full-colour. Metro has been fully
printed in-house since February 2013. A key objective within the
printing plants is the continuous optimisation of print capacity.
This concerns the availability of presses, as well as the number of
employees. As at year-end 2013, the number of TDG employees
declined by 10 FTE in order to align demand and capacity.

TMG Distributie

In 2013, as a follow-up to the previously initiated combined dis-
tribution of dailies partnership with Wegener and NDC, a partner-
ship was established with the Persgroep. TMG Distributie delivers
its own dailies, as well as those of the Persgroep, in the larger part
of the provinces of Noord-Holland and Limburg, and in part of
Flevoland. The Persgroep is responsible for the larger part of the
provinces of Zuid-Holland and Utrecht. This has resulted in clear
cost reductions in 2013. As of mid-2013, TMG’s titles are always
distributed with other dailies throughout all of the Netherlands.
This is the precursor to the creation of a national distribution or-
ganisation, whereby the back-office systems of the various dis-
tribution companies will also be integrated. The joint distribution
organisation can only be implemented after the other distribution
companies also have achieved full collaboration.

In 2013, TMG Distributie reduced its own organisation by approxi-
mately 40% in terms of the number of FTEs. In spite of all these
developments, delivery quality remained stable in 2013 compared
to 2012. In partnership with NDP Nieuwsmedia, the Dutch dailies
distribution companies have brought the effects of the Foreign
Nationals (Employment) Act, in particular the implications of the vi-
carious tax liability, to the attention of the Dutch government. The
latter also applies to the specific consequences of the Minimum

Wage Act that will apply to companies who make use of freelanc-
ers, starting in 2014. Of course, the laws themselves are not open
to debate, the primary concern is to prevent dailies distribution
companies from incurring disproportionately high costs due to the
unintended and unreasonable side effects from these laws.

Chain Coordination

Chain Coordination was established in 2013 and its purpose
is to collect, bundle and share knowledge from within a single
department and to subsequently apply it efficiently, so that all
publishers can optimally benefit from this. It forms the connect-
ing link between the publishers and the various (external) chain
partners such as printers and distribution companies, and on
behalf of the publishers provides the coordination required to
optimally synchronise all chain processes.

Shared Service Centre

The Shared Service Centre was established in order to im-
prove service quality, reduce costs and manage integral costs,
achieve a coordinating function between the TMG organisation
and relevant market parties, and achieve synergy of similar in-
ternal business activities. For example, in 2013, cost savings
were realised in the area of office space by optimally reorganis-
ing available office space.

Telegraaf Media ICT

The agreement to outsource the management of workplace auto-
mation and data centres was extended in 2013. The workplaces
will be modernised in the first half of 2014, and the data cen-
tre for business applications will be moved from Amsterdam to
Eindhoven. The ICT toolkit was further simplified in 2013, in part
through means of the implementation of a new advertising sys-
tem. Further information security measures were implemented in
line with increasing requirements in this domain. The operational
reliability of ICT facilities has further increased and ICT costs were
further reduced. The ICT organisation will be further adjusted in
2014, in part by establishing a CIO position and an ICT Shared
Service Centre.

PARTICIPATING

INTERESTS

ProSiebenSat1 Media AG

history and result

In the nineties of the previous century, Telegraaf Media Groep
(TMG) pursued a strategy of diversification and wanted to take a
position in the television industry. However, in the Netherlands,
due its market share of the daily newspaper market, cross-
ownership legislation prohibited TMG from taking an interest
greater than one third in a commercial radio or television sta-
tion. In 1996, TMG therefore acquired an interest of 30% for
approximately € 25 million in the commercial television broad-
caster SBS6, which was starting up at the time. SBS6 was later
expanded to include Net5 (1999) and V8 (2001). The last station
was converted to Veronica (2003) when the Veronica Associa-
tion joined SBS Nederland.

In 2005, TMG exchanged its SBS Broadcasting B.V. (SBS Ned-
erland) equity interest at the time, increased by a one-time cash
investment of approximately € 18 million, for a 20% interest in
SBS Broadcasting S.a.r.l, which was held by funds advised by
Permira and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P (KKR). At that
point in time, TMG’s total outgoing cash flow therefore amount-
ed to € 43 million.

The Dutch cross-ownership regulations were finally relaxed in
June 2007; however, by that time SBS Broadcasting S.a.r.|. had
already been sold to ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (ProSieben-
Sat.1). The sale of the interest in SBS gave TMG an incom-
ing cash flow of € 433 million, which, during the year that the
amount was outstanding, produced approximately € 17 million
in interest. At the same that the SBS interest was sold, a call/put
option contract was acquired on the basis of which TMG in 2008
obtained a 6% (12% voting right) interest in ProSiebenSat.1 for
an amount of € 377 million. The reasons for making this invest-
ment were strategic. On the one hand, it was becoming evident
that television broadcasting was more and more becoming an
international business and the acquisition of this interest gave
TMG the opportunity to also participate in the strong interna-
tional growth and synergy opportunities of the new combination
ProSiebenSat.1 - SBS, in addition to its position in the Nether-
lands. On the other hand, this step should also be considered in
the context of TMG’s internationalisation and multimedia strat-
egy. In practical terms this meant that TMG - albeit indirectly
- continued to derive income from the television market during
the period up to and including 2013.

In the period up to and including 2013, TMG received a total of
€ 95 million in dividends, with the key portion being received in
2013 as a result of the super-dividend of € 5.63 per share. In Au-
gust 2013, shares with voting rights owned by TMG were con-
verted to listed shares. Not long after this TMG sold its interest
with a resulting incoming cash flow of approximately € 391 mil-
lion. Of the super-dividend received in 2013 and the proceeds
received from the sale of the interest, TMG shareholders in 2013
were paid interim dividends in the amount of€ 0.50 and € 6.00
per share or depositary receipt for a share, totalling over € 301
million. Furthermore, all of TMG’s bank debts were redeemed
and payments/provisions were made in relation to the ongoing
reorganisations.

In summary, TMG’s interest in various television companies over
the period 1996 - 2013 produced very positive results. The total
outgoing cash flow during that period amounted to € 420 million
and the incoming cash flow amounted to € 936 million. As a re-
sult TMG earned significant income from its (indirect) presence
in the television market.

33

The free-to-air television market is currently undergoing signifi-
cant changes as well. For publishers such as TMG it is no longer
about the ‘television market’, the ‘TV landscape’ or ‘television’ in
this respect, but rather it is all about the necessary shift towards
the production of video, in addition to the other content that is
already being produced. The way in which this video content is
distributed has become of secondary importance. It is no longer
relevant whether the distribution of video occurs via TV sets or
(other) devices that are connected to the (mobile) internet. TMG
is working hard on realising its ambition of becoming a leading
party in the world of video as well.

RISK MANAGEMENT

introduction

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN THE REALISATION OF THE COMPANY’S OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY.
TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THESE RISKS TO THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE EXTENT, THE TELEGRAAF MEDIA GROEP
(TMG) APPLIES A RISK MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY FOCUSED ON INCREASING RISK AWARENESS WITHIN
THE COMPANY AND ON ACQUIRING BETTER INSIGHT INTO AND CONTROLLING OPERATING RISKS.

description of TMG’s internal risk management and
control system

Risk management is an integral part of the day-to-day operations.
The internal risk management and control system is described in
TMG’s Risk Management Policy and in the TMG Code of Conduct.
TMG’s objective in this respect is to identify and manage the
events (opportunities and threats) that can affect the realisation
of the strategy and objectives. TMG has subdivided its risks into
4 risk categories in accordance with the well-known COSO En-
terprise Risk Management Framework (COSO ERM), as follows:

Strategic Risks (S) The strategic risks are identified each
year by the Management Teams of the business units, Cor-
porate Staff and the Executive Board on the basis of TMG’s
strategy and objectives. Actions are then identified to manage
the risks.

Operational Risks (O) A Risk Self-assessment of TMG’s pri-
mary and secondary processes is conducted each year in ac-
cordance with a fixed schedule. The process managers twice
a year update the risk control matrices that contain the risks,
control measures and actions. In addition, they conduct au-
dits every six months to determine whether the control mea-
sures are effective.

Financial & Reporting Risks (F) The audits conducted by the
process managers every six months are, among other things,
focused on testing the control measures concerning the most
significant items in the financial statements.

Compliance Risks (C) The responsible Compliance Officer is
responsible for policies focused on compliance with laws and
regulations. Changes in laws and regulations and amended
policies are regularly discussed with the Management Teams
of the business units and are communicated to employees.

The internal management environment forms the foundation for
TMG’s internal risk management and control system. In this re-
spect, hard controls (policy, processes and systems) as well as
soft controls are assessed, whereby the tone set by manage-
ment, integrity and culture are important aspects.

Controlling

The risk management activities are anchored throughout the en-
tire business operation:

* Management: each manager is responsible for managing
his/her risks. Twice a year the Management Team reports on
the progress of the control activities of its most important
strategic and operational risks and conducts audits of the op-
eration of the control measures related to the most important
risks.

Risk Management: facilitates the risk management activities,
for example through means of Risk Self-assessments and by
monitoring key control audits.

Internal Audit: conducts operational, financial and project
audits and provides assurance concerning the management
of risks associated with business units, processes and proj-
ects.

External Auditor: audits the financial statements and in this
respect relies on the risk management activities carried out.

TMG Annual Report 2013

supervision and monitoring

The management of risks is a continuous process and forms
part of TMG’s planning & control cycle. Monitoring and adjust-
ments take place on a regular basis. The most important risks
and risk management progress is regularly reported and dis-
cussed with the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board’s
Audit Committee.

RISK MANAGEMENT IS

AN INTEGRAL PART
OF THE DAY-TO-DAY
OPERATION

Audit Committee

The Supervisory Board in June 2013 established a separate Au-
dit Committee as a result of which there is more specific super-
vision of the quality of the internal risk management and control
system.

impact of strategy change on the risk management and
control system

TMG has made a number of successive strategy changes with
impact on a large number of processes and systems over a
short period of time. The risk management and control system
must be adjusted in accordance with these changes. This in-
volves the reallocation of responsibilities. Furthermore, a new
advertisement system was implemented for TMG Regional and
Local Media and for TMG National Media and a plan has been
created for organising IT Governance within TMG. Management
controls will be re-evaluated and a number of risk analyses were
carried out on an accelerated basis. Renewed attention will be
devoted to creating risk awareness within TMG in various ways,
for example by organising workshops on integrity-related top-
ics. A start was made on these adjustments at the end of 2013.
This will continue to be pursued in 2014.

evaluation of the risk management and control system

TMG each year evaluates its internal risk management and
control system. The internal risk management and control sys-
tem, as well as the management controls were tested in 2013.
In 2013, specific attention was devoted to risk management

in relation to information security, for example by testing and
conducting risk analyses and creating increased risk awareness
among employees. On the basis of horizontal oversight, there
is coordination between TMG and the Dutch tax authorities
concerning the evaluation of the existence and operation of in-
ternal control measures implemented by TMG. Fraud reporting
and monitoring operates in accordance with the Fraud Policy.
Fraud is included as a specific topic in
the 2014 risk awareness programme.
TMG’s contingency plan was reviewed
at the beginning of 2013. Due to the
organisational changes, this plan will
be re-updated in 2014. Furthermore,
an integrated audit/risk management
plan will be used in 2014.

identified strategic risks for 2013

Five strategic risks and mitigating measures were identified for 2013. Part of the planned measures have been implemented.
The measures were partially adjusted to the strategic change in direction.

strategic Risks

implemented Measures

The inability to offset the declining return related to traditional
activities on a timely basis by organic (growing) digital activities
(the translation of new technology to business).

The strategy was adjusted in 2013. Advertising and circulation
revenues dropped lower than expected. A more severe cost
reduction programme was introduced at increased speed.
The new strategy is focused on TMG’s brands, whereby print
and online are jointly deployed. New revenue models and prod-
ucts are being developed within the brands. Examples of this
are the implementation of the ‘payment wall’ for digital content,
digital subscriptions, the development of new apps, new web-
sites such as Upcoming and the growth of GroupDeal.

Organisational delays due to differences in insight among the
various business units.

The organisational structure was drastically changed. This has
resulted in a flatter organisation with fewer management lay-
ers. Shorter lines facilitate faster decision-making. The print
and online organisation in support of the national titles have
been merged within TMG National Media. The print and on-
line organisation in support of the local and regional titles have
been merged within TMG Regional and Local Media. Work is
performed on the basis of a common goal with the TMG brands
as the key theme. The consolidation of different business units
and different cultures has the attention of the Executive Board
and the Management Teams.

The inability to attract and retain talented and highly qualified
people on the job market.

TMG stimulates entrepreneurship within the organisation
and among its employees. Employees are given more space
for working out their ideas and taking initiative. Management
Teams realise that the necessary organisational changes have
a great deal of impact on employees. Transparency and clear
communication about changes is very important.

The obstruction of the growth of deployed or newly deployed
and/or still to be developed revenue models due to laws and
regulations.

New revenue models are tested against laws and regulations
ahead of time. New revenue models are further developed with-
in the limits of the law.

The insufficient ability to guarantee a stable ICT environment
(hacking and/or crash) in terms of the continuity of business
operations.

In 2013, a number of obsolete application environments and
servers was replaced and updated, including the implementa-
tion of a new advertising system and financial system, and the
replacement of the telephone switch. Various websites were
subjected to tests and adjusted on the basis of the findings.
ICT has initiated an awareness campaign on information
security.

identified risks for 2014

TMG Annual Report 2013

37

TMG has identified its key risks for 2014, taking the continuously changing media environment, economic trends and the changing
job market into account. The key risks from 2013 reappear in 2014. Mitigating measures were initiated in 2013 and will continue to
be applied in 2014. The key identified risks are subdivided into strategic, operational, financial and compliance risks.

strategic Risks

measures

declining Market

The inability to offset the declining return related to traditional
activities (on advertising and subscription sources of income)
on a timely basis by organic (growing) digital activities.

The measures introduced in 2013 will be continued in 2014.
The focus on strong brands will result in more focused and ef-
fective marketing. Budgeted cost reductions are continuously
monitored and the cost reduction programme that has been
introduced will be completed.

innovative Capacity
Insufficient capacity to develop new profitable business mo-
dels for journalistic content and online propositions.

Arestructuring of the organisation, processes and procedures
will take place within the editorial boards of the national dai-
lies. A new editorial system will furthermore be implemented in
2014. The brand managers within TMG are responsible for the
continued development of medium-type-independent (new)
products, platforms and concepts associated with the brand.
Brand Managers, the Editorial Board and Commerce are work-
ing together on the basis of the brand.

retaining and attracting properly qualified personnel
and entrepreneurial competencies.
Insufficient capacity to retain or attract the right employees.

TMG’s current market demands more entrepreneurship and
greater disposition to change. By reintroducing entrepreneur-
ship into the organisation through means of greater flexibility
within existing procedures and internal regulations, and faster
decision-making through means of a flatter organisation struc-
ture, TMG expects to realise the required changes. TMG offers
employees the opportunity to develop and implement creative
ideas. The Executive Board and the Management Teams are
working on the necessary cultural turnaround. Greater flexibil-
ity will be incorporated into the terms and conditions of em-
ployment, which will stimulate greater freedom of movement.

operational Risks

measures

process Efficiency
Insufficient capacity to further optimise complex business pro-
cesses.

Changes in the media world are occurring in rapid succes-
sion. TMG anticipates these changes by adjusting its strategy
and organisation structure. Processes need to be adjusted in
accordance with these changes. Where possible, processes
will be further automated, for example, the self-service within
the advertising process. The content management system
will be replaced, making it easier to serve multiple publishing
platforms. The circulation process will be migrated to a single
system. In addition, greater use will have to be made of auto-
mated controls.

operational Risks

ICT-Transformatie

The insufficient ability to guarantee a stable ICT environment in
terms of the continuity of business operations in the context of
the ICT transformation.

measures

Due to the reorganisation, ICT activities have been fragmented
throughout the organisation. The ICT organisation will be re-
structured in 2014. By merging activities greater insight into
and focus on ICT assets and ICT Risk Management will be cre-
ated. The CIO, responsible for restructuring the ICT organisa-
tion and the TMG-wide ICT policy started in 2014. In 2014, the
office automation system will be replaced and applications will
be further rationalised.

financial risks

working Capital
Insufficient capacity to manage the outstanding receivables
within the current economic climate.

measures

Outstanding receivables are carefully monitored. Customers
are more critically assessed in terms of their financial position.
Regular debtor meetings are taking place during which key ra-
tios are managed.

compliance Risks

data Legislation
Insufficient capacity to manage data quality within the appli-
cable laws and regulations..

measures

A plan, designed to comply with laws and regulations and
at the same time ensure data quality, will be developed and
implemented.

The current use of data will be tested against current legisla-
tion and where necessary measures will be implemented.

The Executive Board is aware that it is not possible for any risk management and control system to provide an absolute guarantee
for achieving the enterprise’s objective, nor can this system prevent errors, fraud or violations of laws and regulations.

management Letter

Each year the external auditor reports to TMG’s Audit Committee on his findings related to the administrative organisation and the
internal controls. The external auditor recommended in the management letter on the reliability and continuity of IT systems espe-
cially on IT Governance, logical acces control and change management. TMG employs an internal control framework that identifies
the potential risks together with relevant and proper internal control measures. The key control measures are tested by independent
employees within TMG during the reporting year. The current situation includes various manual internal control measures. The cur-
rent systems will be replaced. This creates an opportunity for converting manual control measures into automated control measures.

financial risks
market, credit, liquidity, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.

For a more detailed description and quantification of the above-mentioned financial risks and the management of these risks, see
page 91-93 of the financial statements.
