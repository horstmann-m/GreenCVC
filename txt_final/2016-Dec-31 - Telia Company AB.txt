and formulate the strategy, namely megatrends, stakeholders’
opinions and our capabilities and resources.

MEGATRENDS

Our society is changing more rapidly through digitalization.
This might be a shift as big as the industrial revolution. The
shift is enabled by the radically reduced cost for storage
and computing, exponentially increasing number of con-
nected devices combined with advanced analytics and
artificial intelligence. This is what we believe will lead to the
tipping point. As other technologies are becoming gener-
ally available the digitalization will take further steps. The
sweet spot will be the intersection of these trends.

At the same time, we have a number of trends that
are the legacy of how we implemented industrialization.
Climate change, increased inequality and rapid urbaniza-
tion. This requires societal attention and drives the need
for a sustainable approach to all that we do. As we also
live longer than ever, medical advances give cure, and
relief from more and more deceases we will have a
pressure on our social security systems but also a risk
of a health inequality that might further challenge our
social structure.

Digitalization
everywhere

An exponential techno-
logical development that
will be the facilitator for
new advances and create
new ways for sharing

and learning from new
advances and thereby
utilizing and also com-
mercializing innovation
advances even faster.

Digitalization that will
affect every company,
individual and soci-

ety and drive changes

in most, if not all, areas.
This starts from always
being connected through
ubiquitous connectivity,
personalized entertain-
ment, companies
changing from physical to
digital to everything being
connected.

IMPACT OF THE TRENDS

On society

Our societies in the Nordic and Baltic regions will change
more rapidly than other regions due to strong infrastruc-
ture, tech savvy population and a leading digitalized posi-
tion. As many jobs will disappear and be replaced by new,
the need for re-training and innovation will be required
over the coming years. To deal with the root cause of the
environmental change the use of renewable energy and
energy efficiency will be at the top of the agenda. The
digital divide must be closed to secure that the digitaliza-
tion gives opportunities for many people to be active in the
change and create new companies, services, experiences
and possibilities.

On our customers

For the consumer customers there will be a need for
affordable connectivity, services that make everyday life
easier and entertainment services that offer adaptation to
every customer’s preferences. The need for services that
create new possibilities for personal development and take
away time waste will grow rapidly over the coming years.
At the same time, the need for security and privacy will in-
crease. Some customers care about privacy and some do

Urbanization

As more and more people
move to fewer cities, the
pressure on infrastruc-
ture and sustainability

will be enormous. The
concentration of people
will also make food, water
and energy supply even
more sensitive. Managing
logistics, utilization and
distribution will require

a level of resilience and
continuity that only can
be done through insight,

Aging population

The aging population will
drive increased health-
care need but also create
a target market with
active and affluent elderly
who will look for an abil-
ity for self-actualization
and quality of life. Here
the digitalization of the
healthcare will be the key
enabler for a sustainable
healthcare system driving
predictive healthcare and
home care.

response.

not. This requires services and service providers to adapt
to the preferences of each individual.

For the business customers the need for a digitalization
partner is the key driving force. Many if not all companies,
are facing the challenge to adapt their business to the
demands of the digitalized world. Every product or service
must gather information to further refine and develop
the product. This will drive companies to connect their
products to the internet. The pay-per-use model is likely to
grow as more and more products are turned into ser-
vices. In this world of rapidly evolving technologies, most
companies want to buy services to enable digitalization.
The areas of value creation will stay in the company but
the enablers and supporting services are more likely to be
bought from someone else as a service.

On Telia Company

Firstly, the need of connectivity will continue to grow ex-
ponentially. The data growth will require both build-out of
new technologies and continuously expansion of capacity.
Customers are being more and more technology agnostic,
and take connectivity for granted. This will require that any
operator remains relevant to the customers and provides
a competitive advantage versus competitors. It will also
require a clear choice of competitive position.

CAPABILITIES
AND RESOURCES

The key assets that Telia Company has is the

customer base, trust from customers and an
excellent network infrastructure. We are good at
delivering volume-based services efficiently and
creating B2B solutions including management.
We have operations in low-cost countries and
leading competence in networks and operations.

ENHANCE THE CORE

STRATEGY

STRATEGY

Our strategy is in the third year of execution. It is based on
continuous development of our core business combined
with focused bets in areas that are strengthening the core
but also build new businesses in growing areas.

Enhance the core

The foundation is superior network connectivity. This means
that we secure a network that can transport massive data
volumes with high quality and our investments are steered
towards modern technologies such as fiber and 4G. We are
also developing 5G together with our industry partners and
have started to virtualize our network and drive the software
defined networks. As voice is declining we monetize data to
compensate for that.

However, a quality network must be combined with an
excellent customer experience and customer loyalty. This
means that we need to offer customers a seamless experi-
ence independent of which networks they are moving be-
tween. As the mobile and the fixed networks are converg-
ing, we can optimize the transportation of data to secure
both the experience and the production of data. However,
to further build the experience we must deliver solutions
and functionality in order to sell things as a service. This
means that we are focusing on the IT and telecom conver-

gence for the B2B customers. As IT moves to cloud and
several customers are using the same production environ-
ment, the IT business is moving towards the telco logic
and thereby gives us an opportunity to capture a larger
part of the customers’ telco and IT spend.

In the B2C market we are focusing on delivering a con-
verged customer experience. This means that we secure
that the customer can interact with us and our services
seamless between channels, devices, networks and ser-
vices with a unified and constant experience. By giving the
customer the best experience, we also build loyalty and
preference towards our services.

In order to secure competitive operations we are re-
building our factory. This is what we call transformed op-
erations. We start by simplifying our product portfolio and
secure attractive business rules. After that, we build new
IT systems that are agile and flexible to secure a competi-
tive cost level. By using a modern operational transforma-
tion architecture with application program interfaces we
can secure adaptability also for future needs. Driving this
through an online first mentality, we can also simplify and
make our distribution more customer-friendly.

We are also managing things cross border to secure
that we take out scale synergies in the areas where we
can. One of the key areas is sourcing where we reduce
cost through scale sourcing and demand driven from
group-level.

19

In the networks area we optimize build-out through
analytics and by closing down legacy networks.

Explore opportunities close to the core
In order to further grow our business and create customer
relevance we have chosen four focus areas in adjacencies:

¢ loT - Internet of things. Which is connected devices

combined with analytics and rule engines. This is offered

as connectivity, enabling platforms, vertical solutions

of eco-system services. loT is another example of the

convergence between IT and telecom.

eHealth — In this area we are offering connected medi-

cal devices, home care solutions and special services

targeting the treatment of specific diseases. We are also

working with hospitals and clinics on digitalized journals

and decision support systems.

¢ Security - In this area we secure customers’ networks
from intrusion and cyber-attacks. We also offer solutions
to secure identity and the integrity of customer solutions.

¢ Media — We are today a leading TV provider in the
Nordics and Baltics. We are now moving our services
to on-demand and OTT to secure a leading position in
media services targeting the new consumption behavior.
We seek the richest content offering and best user expe-
rience combining multiple content sources.

es of SEK 1.50 each to be paid in April and October,
respectively.

On December 14, 2016, Telia Company announced

Treasury shares

As of December 31, 2015, 4,588 Telia Company shares
were held by the company itself and the total numbers

of issued and outstanding shares were 4,330,084,781

and 4,330,080,193, respectively. On April 29, 2016, Telia
Company AB acquired additional 118,398 own shares at
an average price of SEK 38.6519 to cover commitments
under the “Long term Incentive Program 2013/2016”. Dur-
ing the second quarter of 2016, Telia Company distributed
122,986 shares to the incentive program participants. As
of December 31, 2016, no Telia Company shares were
held by the company itself or by its subsidiaries. The

total numbers of issued and outstanding shares were
4,330,084,781.

Net sales

In continuing operations, net sales decreased 2.7 per-
cent to SEK 84,178 million (86,498). Net sales in local
currencies and excluding acquisitions and disposals,
decreased 0.8 percent. The positive effect from exchange
rate fluctuations was 0.1 percent and the negative effect
of acquisitions and disposals was 2.0 percent. Service
revenues in local currencies, excluding acquisitions and
disposals, decreased 0.4 percent as growth in mobile ser-
vice revenues in most of our markets and fiber installation
revenues in Sweden was not enough to mitigate pressure
on traditional fixed telephony revenues and the decline of
low margin voice revenues in Telia Carrier. Also contribut-
ing to the decline in service revenues was lower intercon-
nect revenues in Finland and Norway, driven by changes
in termination rates. Excluding decline in Telia Carrier and
lower revenues from interconnect, service revenues in
local currencies and excluding acquisitions and disposals,
would have increased by 0.3 percent.

Cost of goods and services sold (COGS) was SEK
33,578 million (35,931) or equal to a 6.5 percent decrease
compared to 2015. Around half of the decrease is due to
the divestment of Yoigo in Spain and half of the decrease
is mainly due to lower handset sales in Finland, as well as
lower interconnect costs in Finland and Norway.

Personnel expenses, in local currencies and excluding
acquisitions and disposals, decreased 0.9 percent com-
pared to 2015, driven by region Sweden, partly offset by
an increase in region Europe. In region Sweden, the lower
personnel expenses were primarily due to lower pension
costs. In region Europe, Finland was the main driver of
increased personnel expenses due to salary inflation and
higher costs for variable pay.

Marketing expenses, in local currencies and excluding
acquisitions and disposals, decreased 4.9 percent, mainly
due to lower marketing spend in Norway. As for the other
cost items, figures in reported SEK are impacted by the
divestment of Yoigo in Spain.

Amortization, depreciation and impairment losses de-
creased 9.7 percent to SEK 11,534 million (12,780), mainly
explained by impairment losses related to Denmark in
2015, and the divestment of Yoigo in Spain from the fourth
quarter of 2016. Amortization and depreciation excluding
non-recurring items increased 6.0 percent to SEK 11,534
million (10,880). In local currencies and excluding acquisi-
tions and disposals, the increase was 6.5 percent.

Other operating income and expenses, net excluding
amortization, depreciation and impairment losses, was
SEK 4,093 million (-433) impacted by a capital gain from
the divestment of Yoigo in Spain.

Non-recurring items

Non-recurring items affecting operating income in continu-
ing operations totaled SEK 3,967 million (-3,208) and were
mainly related to a capital gain from the divestment of
Yoigo in Spain and restructuring charges in connection to
cost reduction initiatives.

Earnings

In continuing operations, EBITDA, excluding non-recur-
ring items, increased 2.2 percent to SEK 25,836 million
(25,281). In local currencies and excluding acquisitions
and disposals, EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, in-
creased 2.6 percent with positive development in both re-
gion Sweden and Europe, respectively. EBITDA excluding
non-recurring items, in region Sweden increased primarily

25

due to growth in fixed broadband, tv and fiber installation
revenues and lower costs which compensated for lower
traditional fixed revenues. The increase in EBITDA exclud-
ing non-recurring items, in region Europe was mainly
attributable to Finland and Norway, driven by growth in
mobile service revenues. Other operations contributed
negatively, primarily due to higher pension and variable
pay expenses as well as costs related to Division X. The
EBTIDA margin, excluding non-recurring items, increased
to 30.7 percent (29.2).

In continuing operations, operating income, excluding
non-recurring items, decreased 3.9 percent to SEK 17,123
million (17,814), mainly due to lower income from associ-
ated companies and higher depreciation and amortization
which more than offset the EBITDA increase. The lower
income from associated companies was mainly explained
by negative foreign exchange rate effects. The operating
margin, excluding income from associated companies and
non-recurring items affecting operating income, was 17.0
percent (16.7).

Financial net, taxes and net income

Financial net improved to SEK -1,841 million (-2,917),
primarily impacted by foreign exchange rate effects, lower
interest costs and changes in the interest component of
the defined benefit pension plan.

Income taxes increased to SEK -2,816 million (-2,157).
The effective tax rate was 14.6 percent (18.5), mainly
related to non-taxable capital gain on the sale of Yoigo in
Spain.

Net income from continuing operations increased to SEK
16,433 million (9,532) and net income from discontinued
operations decreased to SEK -9,937 million (673). Total net
income decreased to SEK 6,496 million (10,205) of which
SEK 3,732 million is attributable to the owners of the par-
ent company. Earnings per share attributable to owners
of the parent company increased to SEK 3.76 (2.16) for
continuing operations.

CAPEX

In continuing operations, capital expenditures (CAPEX)
increased to SEK 15,625 million (14,595) and the CAPEX-
to-service revenues ratio to 21.8 percent (20.0). Main
CAPEX components were fiber investments in Sweden
(SEK 3.2 billion), continued roll-out of 4G in region Europe
as well as IT investments focusing on improved business
support. Further, telecom licenses and spectrum permits
were acquired in Finland, Norway, Denmark and Lithuania.
CAPEX, excluding license and spectrum fees, amounted
to SEK 15,016 million (14,289) and the CAPEX-to-service
revenues ratio was 21.0 percent (19.6).

FINANCIAL POSITION, CAPITAL
RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Financial position
The financial position remained stable year-on-year.

Goodwill increased to SEK 57.9 billion mainly explained
by positive exchange rate differences, no impairment
charges were recorded for continuing operations. Other
intangible assets totaled SEK 13.0 billion, positively
impacted through CAPEX (investments) of SEK 2.8 billion
and exchange rate differences but negatively impacted by
amortization of SEK 2.6 billion.

Property, plant and equipment, totaling SEK 58.1 billion,
increased through CAPEX (investments) totaling SEK 12.8
billion and decreased due to depreciations amounting to
SEK 8.9 billion. The divestment and deconsolidation of
Yoigo in Spain in the fourth quarter of 2016 affected prop-
erty, plant and equipment by SEK 2.2 billion. The effects
from exchange rate differences were positive.

Financial and other non-current assets comprise in-
vestments in associated companies and joint ventures,
deferred tax assets, pension obligation assets and other
assets, mainly long-term interest-bearing receivables.

The carrying value of associated companies and joint
ventures was SEK 22.7 billion, of which the carrying values
of Russian MegaFon and Turkish Turkcell were SEK 4.7 bil-
lion and SEK 17.1 billion, respectively. Share of net income
in the associates and joint ventures amounting to SEK 2.8
billion added value, offset by dividends received from the
companies, in total SEK 2.1 billion. Currency effects were

negative at SEK 1.4 billion, due to negative development
of the Turkish lira, partly offset by positive development of
the Russian rubel, both versus the Swedish krona.

Deferred tax assets decreased mainly due to the divest-
ment of Yoigo in Spain and deconsolidation of tax loss
carry-forwards related to the Spanish operation, whilst
deferred tax liabilities (included in Provisions and other
liabilities) were stable. All in all, the net deferred tax liability
was SEK 6.2 billion at year-end 2016.

Total long-term interest-bearing receivables increased to
SEK 18.1 billion (16.4), mainly as a result of using surplus
cash to invest in bonds.

Cash and cash equivalents in total were stable versus
2015. Cash flow from operations and the divestments
of Ncell in Nepal and Yoigo in Spain had positive impact
offset by pay-out of ordinary dividend and changes in the
debt portfolio described further below.

Assets classified as held for sale, totaling SEK 29.0 bil-
lion, decreased mainly as a result of the divestment and
deconsolidation of Ncell in Nepal and impairment charges,
see Note C34 for further information. These effects were
partially offset by a prolonged license in Uzbekistan.

Total equity decreased 7.2 percent to SEK 94.9 billion
(102.2) negatively impacted by dividends of SEK 13.0
billion to the owners of the parent company and SEK 2.4
billion to non-controlling interests whilst net income of SEK
6.5 billion affected equity positively. Other comprehen-
sive income had a positive impact of SEK 1.5 billion with
positive currency effects of total SEK 2.2 billion offset by
negative remeasurement effects on pension obligations net
amounting to SEK 1.3 billion.

Total gross borrowings decreased to SEK 94.5 billion
(100.9) mainly explained by the divestment and decon-
solidation of Yoigo in Spain and repayments of the debt
portfolio partly related to a credit facility related to the
acquisition of Tele2 in Norway in 2015.

Provisions and other liabilities increased mainly due
to the provision for the settlement amount proposed by
the US and Dutch authorities, see Note C34 for further
information.

Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale,
totaling SEK 13.6 billion, increased mainly due to the
above described license in Uzbekistan, partly offset by a

Credit facilities

Telia Company believes its available bank credit facilities
and updated open-market financing programs are suf-
ficient for the present known liquidity requirements. In the
continuing operations, Telia Company’s surplus liquidity
(short-term investments, cash and bank, and certain se-
curities with maturities exceeding 12 months but convert-
ible to cash within 2 days) was in total SEK 29.8 billion at
year-end. In addition, the total available unutilized amount
under committed bank credit facilities as well as overdraft
and short-term credit facilities at year-end were SEK 16.0
billion.

Telia Company AB shall target a solid investment grade
long-term credit rating, defined as A- to BBB+. In May
2016 Moody’s decided to downgrade Telia Company’s
long- term rating to Baa1 with stable outlook after an ex-
tensive period with negative outlook. The short term rating
was reconfirmed as P-2.

After the announcement of the proposed settlement from
the US and Dutch authorities in September 2016, Stand-
ard & Poor’s Ratings Services decided to put its long term
credit rating of Telia Company of A- on CreditWatch nega-
tive but confirmed A-2 for short-term borrowings.

Telia Company normally arrange its financing through
the parent company Telia Company AB. Most issuance are
done under the company’s existing EMTN (Euro Medium
Term Note) program of EUR 12 billion. The primary means
of external borrowing are described in Notes C20 and
C26 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2016,
Telia Company AB issued no new debt in the debt capital
markets but announced in May 2016 a tender offer in
GBP under which an amount of GBP 153.9 million of the
outstanding bond with maturity 2042 was bought back. At
year-end, the average time to maturity of Telia Company
AB’s overall debt portfolio was approximately 7.8 years.

At the end of 2016, no Commercial Papers were
outstanding.

Cash flow, continuing and discontinued operations
Cash flow from operating activities decreased to SEK 26.0
billion (35.2), mainly due to Ncell in Nepal not being con-
solidated the full year, weakened operational performance
in Eurasia and dividend received from Turkcell of SEK 4.7
billion net of taxes in 2015.

Cash flow from investing activities, totaling SEK -7.4
billion (-29.0) consists of investments in intangible assets,
property plant and equipment, acquisitions and divest-
ments, changes in loans receivable and in short term
investments, and repayments from or additional contribu-
tions to pension funds. Cash CAPEX remained flat com-
pared to 2015. Cash received from divestments was SEK
12.1 billion (4.7), which mainly refers to Ncell in Nepal and
Yoigo in Spain. Cash paid for business combinations and
other equity instruments was SEK 0.1 billion (6.2). Contribu-
tion from the Swedish pension fund was SEK 0.5 billion (0).
Net cash used for granting loans was SEK -2.9 billion (-10.5)
mainly net from investment bonds. Cash inflow from net
changes in short-term investments was SEK 1.5 billion (1.6).

Cash outflow from financing activities in 2016, totaling
SEK 22.5 billion (9.6), included dividends paid to share-
holders of the parent company of SEK 13.0 billion (13.0)
and to non-controlling interests of SEK 2.4 billion (0.8).

Net outflow from new and repaid borrowings amounted
to SEK 8.9 billion (inflow 4.1) mainly from repayment of a

were SEK 0.6 billion (0) and net of other derivatives was
SEK 1.1 billion (0.5).

See Consolidated statements of cash flows and related
Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further
details.

Outlook for 2017
Free cash flow from continuing operations, excluding
licenses and dividends from associated companies, is
expected to be above SEK 7 billion. This operational free
cash flow together with dividends from associates, should
cover a dividend around the 2016 level.

EBITDA from continuing operations, excluding non-
recurring items, in local currencies, excluding acquisitions
and disposals, is expected to be around the 2016 level.

Dividend policy
Telia Company intends to distribute a minimum of 80 per-
cent of free cash flow from continuing operations, exclud-
ing licenses. The dividend should be split and distributed
in two equal tranches.

The company targets a leverage corresponding to Net
debt/EBITDA of 2x plus/minus 0.5x.

The company shall continue to target a solid investment
grade long-term credit rating (A- to BBB+).

fund held 366,802 shares and its Finnish personnel fund
673,749 shares in the company, respectively, in total repre-
senting 0.03 percent of the outstanding shares.

There are no provisions in either the Swedish legislation
or in Telia Company AB’s Articles of Association that would
limit the possibility to transfer Telia Company shares. Telia
Company is not aware of any agreements between major
shareholders of the company regarding the Telia Company
shares.

The Board of Directors does not currently have any
authorization by the general meeting of shareholders to
issue new shares but has the authorization to repurchase
a maximum of 10 percent of the company’s total number
of outstanding shares before the Annual General Meeting
2017. In order to continue to provide the Board of Direc-
tors with an instrument to adapt and improve Telia Com-
pany’s capital structure, the Board of Directors proposes
that the Annual General Meeting on April 5, 2017, resolves
to authorize the Board of Directors to acquire the com-
pany’s own shares. The authorization may be exercised on
one or more occasions before the Annual General Meeting
2017. The maximum number of treasury shares held by the
company may not exceed 10 percent of all shares in the
company.

In case of a change of control in Telia Company AB, the
company might have to repay certain loans at short notice,
since some of Telia Company’s financing agreements
contain customary change-of-control clauses. These
clauses generally also contain other conditions including,
for example, that the change of control has to cause a
negative change in Telia Company’s credit rating in order
to be effective.

For 2016, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual
General Meeting (AGM) an ordinary dividend of SEK 2.00
(3.00), totaling SEK 8,660 million (12,990), or 121 percent
of free cash flow attributable to continuing operations. The
dividend should be split and distributed into two equal
tranches of SEK 1.00 each, one in April 2017 and one in
October 2017. See also section “Proposed appropriation
of earnings.”

In region Sweden, the journey towards more connectivity
and converged offerings continued. In the consumer seg-

32

ment, mobile billed revenues continued to grow and as the
first operator in the world, Telia Sweden offered customers
free mobile surf on the most popular social media sites
and apps, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Cus-
tomers continued to demand fiber and a record of 186,000
new households were reached and SDU villa campaigns
grew 44 percent. The enterprise segment remained chal-
lenging with high price pressure within the large enterprise
segment. The offerings to SME and SoHo (Small office/
Home office) customers were further strengthened with
the launch of personal technicians in addition to personal
advisors in order to assist and take care of the customers’
IT and technology. The year ended with Division X launch-
ing Telia Sense in the connected car space and Telia Zone
which is a connected home play.

Net sales excluding acquisitions and disposals de-
creased 0.3 percent. Net sales in reported currency includ-
ing acquisitions and disposals decreased 0.2 percent to
SEK 37,251 million (37,336). The positive effect of acquisi-
tions and disposals was 0.1 percent. Service revenues,
excluding acquisitions and disposals, decreased 0.6 per-
cent. Mobile service revenues increased 0.4 percent, sup-
ported by strong consumer and wholesale revenues that
more than compensated for the decline in the enterprise
segment. Mobile ARPU rose and the increase in postpaid
subscriptions more than compensated for the decline in
prepaid subscriptions. Fixed service revenues declined
0.6 percent due to the drop in revenues from traditional
fixed telephony and various business solutions. However,
fiber installation revenues continued to partly mitigate that
drop. In addition, Swedish quality index (SKI) reported that
Telia continues to have the most satisfied TV customers in
Sweden which is shown in a continued strong intake. Fur-
thermore, the TV ARPU displayed a double-digit growth.
Broadband revenues grew boosted by growth in recurring
fiber revenues and higher ARPU.

EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, increased 1.3
percent to SEK 14,455 million (14,267) while EBITDA
excluding non-recurring items, acquisitions and disposals
increased 1.2 percent. The growth in mobile, broadband,
TV, fiber and wholesale revenues, cost savings from trans-
formation, procurement and general efficiencies were the
main drivers behind the EBITDA growth despite the drop in
revenues from traditional fixed telephony. In addition, new
revenue streams such as value added and adjacent ser-
vices also contributed to the EBITDA growth. The EBITDA
margin increased to 38.8 percent (38.2).

Operating income, excluding non-recurring items,
decreased 2.3 percent to SEK 9,569 million (9,797). Non-
recurring items impacted operating income were SEK
209 million (514) and were mainly related to restructuring
charges and an old court case partly offset by a divest-
ment of real estate.

CAPEX increased to SEK 7,119 million (6,179). No
licenses and spectrum were acquired during the year,
since the anticipated 700 MHz auction was postponed.
The investments were primarily in fiber, 4G and business
transformation. Telia was awarded best mobile network
which shows that superior network connectivity is created
and that the customer journey from voice to data contin-
ued to be supported.

The focus on monetization on the growing data traffic
continued in our markets during 2016 and “Roam like
home” offerings were successfully launched in all markets
within region Europe. The number of mobile subscrip-
tions declined during the year mainly impacted by the

33

divestment of Yoigo in Spain but also due to decline of
customers’ demand for multiple subscriptions. The share
of post-paid subscriptions increased from 82 percent to 88
percent of the total. Among the fixed services, traditional
fixed telephony continued to decline and the move from
copper- to fiber-based services continued. In the consum-
er segment, ARPU improved in most markets while price
pressure continued within the enterprise segment, most
apparent in Norway and Denmark.

Net sales in local currencies, and excluding acquisi-
tions and disposals decreased 0.4 percent, mainly due
to decreased equipment sales while service revenues
increased. Net sales in reported currency decreased 4.4
percent to SEK 41,746 million (43,658). The effect from
exchange rate fluctuations was positive by 0.2 percent and
the negative effect of acquisitions and disposals was 4.2
percent. Service revenues, in local currency and excluding
acquisitions and disposals, increased 0.7 percent, as mo-
bile service revenue growth compensated for the decline in
fixed service revenues.

EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, increased to
SEK 11,036 million (10,584) in reported currency, and the
margin increased to 26.4 percent (24.2), mainly due to
network efficiencies and lower marketing costs in Norway
combined with cost control in most countries. In local cur-
rencies and excluding acquisitions and disposals, EBITDA,
excluding non-recurring items increased 5.5 percent.

Operating income, excluding non-recurring items,
increased 7.0 percent in reported currency. Non-recurring
items in 2016 were mainly related to a capital gain from
the divestment of Yoigo in Spain and personnel restructur-
ing across the markets. Operating income increased to
SEK 9,529 million (2,375) in reported currency, primarily as
2016 was positively impacted by the capital gain from the
divestment of Yoigo in Spain and 2015 being negatively
impacted by goodwill impairment charges related to the
operation in Denmark.

CAPEX excluding license and spectrum fees decreased
9.5 percent mainly driven by lower mobile network invest-
ments in Norway and Finland.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Annual and Sustainability Report 2016

Net sales in reported currency decreased 1.8 percent to
SEK 13,042 million (13,279). In local currency excluding
acquisitions and disposals the decrease was 3.0 percent,
mainly due to decline in equipment sales. Service revenues
declined 0.1 percent in local currency, excluding acquisi-
tions and disposals, as growth in mobile billed revenues
was offset by decline in interconnect revenues and fixed
service revenues. Growth in mobile billed revenues stems
primarily from higher ARPU in the consumer segment
which more than offset the interconnect revenue decline.
TV revenues grew as a result of higher ARPU while fixed
broadband revenues declined as competition from mobile
services impacted both broadband ARPU and the number
of broadband subscriptions.

The EBITDA margin, excluding non-recurring items,
increased to 31.1 percent (29.7), positively impacted by
lower share of equipment sales. In local currency, exclud-
ing acquisitions and disposals, EBITDA excluding non-
recurring items increased 1.7 percent.

During the year, the number of TV subscriptions grew
by 3,000. Mobile, fixed telephony and broadband sub-
scriptions decreased by 53,000, 15,000 and 30,000,
respectively, the latter due to customers abandoning fixed
broadband in favour of mobile services.

Net sales in reported currency decreased 0.4 percent to

0.2 percent in local currency, excluding acquisitions and
disposals, mainly due to decline in interconnect and fixed
service revenues. The latter due to the divestment of the
fixed telephony subscription base in the fourth quarter of
2015. Mobile service revenue increased slightly as whole-
sale revenues compensated for the interconnect decline.
Mobile ARPU declined, driven by the lower interconnect
rate, despite improved consumer ARPU.

The EBITDA margin, excluding non-recurring items,
increased to 34.5 percent (30.4), explained by network
efficiencies and lower cost for customer acquisitions and
marketing spend.

The number of mobile subscriptions decreased by
100,000 during the year.

despite a decline in the subscription base, due to growth
in wholesale and interconnect revenues. Fixed broadband
and TV revenues showed growth but fixed service rev-
enues as a whole decreased driven by decline in traditional
fixed telephony and business solutions.

The EBITDA margin, excluding non-recurring items,
declined to 11.8 percent (12.6), negatively impacted by
continued price pressure in the enterprise segment.

Net sales in reported currency increased 3.9 percent to
SEK 3,268 million (8,146). Service revenues increased

3.7 percent in local currency, excluding acquisitions and
disposals driven by both mobile and fixed service rev-
enues as the decline in fixed telephony was more than
compensated for by growth in other fixed services. Mobile
ARPU increased 8.1 percent mainly due to a higher share
of post-paid subscriptions.

The EBITDA margin, excluding non-recurring items,
increased to 34.9 percent (33.4), driven by the increase in
service revenues coupled with cost control and integration
synergies.

The number of mobile subscriptions decreased by 9,000
during the year, pre-paid subscriptions declined while
post-paid increased in line with the overall trend in the
market. Fixed telephony subscriptions declined by 30,000,
while broadband subscriptions grew by 12,000 and TV

The number of mobile subscriptions increased by

Net sales in local currencies and excluding acquisitions
and disposals decreased 3.0 percent. In reported currency,
net sales decreased 3.7 percent to SEK 7,468 million
(7,753). The decrease was mainly explained by lower ser-
vice revenues related to voice traffic in Telia Carrier.

EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, decreased to
SEK 345 million (430) due to higher pension and vari-
able pay expenses as well as costs related to Division X.
For Telia Carrier, EBITDA increased by 24.3 percent due
to a more favourable product mix and lower operating
expenses.

Income from associated companies decreased to SEK
2,695 million (3,295) due to lower contribution from Mega-
Fon and Turkcell.

Operating income declined to SEK 2,201 million (2,948),
mainly due to lower income from associated companies.

CAPEX of SEK 2,905 million (2,593) were mainly related
to building and enhancing technology assets, such as IT
systems, core network and product platforms managed on
group level to benefit several countries.

INNOVATION, RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT

Innovation, research and development (R&D) activities are
performed to ensure Telia Company’s leading position in
the telecom industry as well as to support competitive
operations in the short and long term. During 2016, Telia
Company further strengthened its focus on boosting inno-
vation by the establishment of Division X, which is tasked

between Spotify users. At the same time the new digital
ecosystem “Telia Zone” including start-up partners such as
Glue, Manetos, Jaramba, Bright, etc. was announced and
the roll-out to our customers started in November 2016.

Telia Company has also launched a partnership with as

end car features for the cars of today and tomorrow, had
its Swedish commercial launch in November 2016, with
leading ecosystems partners like Bilia, Bilprovningen and
Folksam. During 2017, more partners will be signing up
and the service to be rolled out across the Nordics and
Baltics, and also likely to be launched by other operators,
which are piloting Telia Sense.

As of December 31, 2016, Telia Company had 326 pat-
ent “families” and 1,646 patents and patent applications.
In 2016, Telia Company has completed the streamlining
of Patent portfolio in which 25 patent “families” were
abandoned or expired, which cover outdated solutions or
otherwise the value of the patent family is reduced.

In the continuing operations, Telia Company in 2016
incurred R&D expenses of SEK 173 million (147).

ENVIRONMENT

Telia Company is committed to environmental responsibil-
ity in its own operations and throughout the value chain.
The work is guided by the group environmental policy,
which also covers majority-owned subsidiaries, and the
supplier code of conduct which clarifies environmental
requirements on suppliers. As a minimum, Telia Company
companies shall comply with local legal requirements
wherever they operate. All major subsidiaries in regions
Sweden and Europe are required to work towards ISO
14001 environmental management system certification,
and to set local targets that contribute to the group envi-
ronmental targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
increase energy efficiency and improve waste manage-
ment. Telia Company in Sweden does not conduct any op-
erations subject to environmental permits from authorities
according to the Swedish Environmental Code, Chapter 9.

REMUNERATION TO EXECUTIVE
MANAGEMENT

Proposed remuneration principles for Group
Executive Management 2017

The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General
Meeting on April 5, 2017, resolves on the following prin-
ciples for remuneration to Group Executive Management.
Group Executive Management is defined as the President
and the other members of the Management Team.

Objective of the principles

The objective of the principles is to ensure that the
company can attract and retain the best people in order

to support the purpose and strategy of the company.
Remuneration to Group Executive Management should be
built on a total reward approach and be market relevant,
but not leading. The remuneration principles should enable
international hiring and should support diversity within
Group Executive Management. The market comparison
should be made against a set of peer group companies
with comparable sizes, industries and complexity. The total
reward approach should consist of fixed salary, pension
benefits, conditions for notice and severance pay and
other benefits.

Fixed salary

The fixed salary of a Group Executive Management mem-
ber should be based on competence, responsibility and
performance. The company uses an international evalua-
tion system in order to evaluate the scope and responsibil-
ity of the position. Market benchmark is conducted on a
regular basis. The individual performance is monitored and
used as a basis for annual reviews of fixed salaries.

Pension

Pension and retirement benefits should be based on a de-
fined contribution model, which means that a premium is
paid amounting to a certain percentage of the individual’s
annual salary. When deciding the size of the premium, the


--- Page 25 ---

Annual and Sustainability Report 2016

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT

level of total remuneration should be considered. The level
of contribution should be benchmarked and may vary due
to the composition of fixed salary and pension. The retire-
ment age is normally 65 years of age.

Other benefits

The company provides other benefits in accordance with
market practice. A Group Executive Management member
may be entitled to a company car, health and care provi-
sions, etc. Internationally hired Group Executive Man-
agement members and those who are asked to move to
another country can be offered mobility related benefits for
a limited period of time.

Notice of termination and severance pay

The termination period for a Group Executive Management
member may be up to six (6) months (twelve (12) months
for the President) when given by the employee and up to
twelve (12) months when given by the company. In case
the termination is given by the company the individual
may be entitled to a severance payment up to twelve (12)
months. Severance pay shall not constitute a basis for
calculation of vacation pay or pension benefits. Termina-
tion and severance pay will also be reduced if the indi-
vidual will be entitled to pay from a new employment or if
the individual will be conducting own business during the
termination period or the severance period.

The Board of Directors may make minor deviations on
an individual basis from the principles stated above. The
2016 remuneration policy is reproduced in Note C31 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Long-term incentive program 2016/2019
The Annual General Meeting held on April 12, 2016, re-
solved to launch a long-term incentive program (LTI) com-
prising of approximately 200 key employees. This program
is not available for the members of Group Executive Man-
agement. The LTI program should strengthen Telia Com-
pany’s ability to recruit and retain talented key employees,
create a long-term confidence in and commitment to the
group’s long-term development, align key employees’
interests with those of the shareholders, increase the part
of the remuneration that is linked to the company’s per-
formance and encourage shareholding of key employees.
The LTI program rewards performance measured over a
minimum of a three-year period (performance period), is
capped to a maximum value of 60 percent of the annual
base salary and is equity based (delivered in Telia Com-
pany shares with the ambition that the employees should
remain shareholders also after vesting). A prerequisite for
pay-out from the LTI program is the continuous employ-
ment during the length of the program (vesting period).
The LTI program measures performance over a 3-year
period. Financial targets are earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and total share-
holder return (TSR). The final allotment of Telia Company
shares will be based 50 percent on accumulated EBITDA
and 50 percent on TSR compared to a corresponding TSR
development of a pre-defined peer group of companies.
The maximum number of Performance Shares a partici-
pant can receive is the equivalent of 30 percent of the par-

39

ticipant’s annual salary. Accumulated EBITDA represents

50 percent of the Performance Shares (or 15 percent of the

participant’s annual salary):

If 100 percent (or above) of the EBITDA target is met, 100
percent of Performance Shares under the EBITDA part
will vest.

¢ If 97.5 percent (or less) of the target is met, 0 percent of
Performance Shares under the EBITDA part will vest.

If between 97.5 and 100 percent of the target is met, a
proportionate amount of Performance Shares under the
EBITDA part will vest.

No Performance Shares will vest under the EBITDA part

if the Company’s accumulated EBITDA is below the mini-

mum level (97.5 percent) and no additional Performance

Shares will vest if the Company’s accumulated EBITDA is

above the maximum level (100 percent).

TSR part represents 50 percent of the Performance Shares

(or 15 percent of the participant’s annual salary):

° If the Company’s TSR is ranked first or second compared
to the defined peer group of companies, 100 percent of
the Performance Shares under the TSR part will vest.

° If the Company’s TSR is ranked third of fourth, 75 percent
of the Performance Shares under the TSR part will vest.

¢ If the Company’s TSR is ranked fifth or sixth, 50 percent
of the Performance Shares under the TSR part will vest.

° If the Company’s TSR is ranked seventh or lower, no Per-
formance Shares under the TSR part will vest.

The program may be repeated annually. Similar programs
were launched in 2010-2015. The prevalence of an LTI
program is subject to the approval of the Annual General
Meeting. For more information on Telia Company’s LTI
programs, see Note C31 to the consolidated financial
statements.

PARENT COMPANY

The parent company Telia Company AB (Corporate Reg.
No. 556103-4249), which is domiciled in Stockholm,
comprises group executive management functions includ-
ing the group’s internal banking operations. The parent
company has no foreign branches.

Net sales were unchanged at SEK 4 million (4), of which
SEK 3 million (3) was billed to subsidiaries. Income before
taxes decreased to SEK 11,479 million (12,879) mainly
driven by a provision made for a settlement amount
proposed by the US and Dutch authorities partly offset
by increased dividends received and reversal of untaxed
reserves. Net income was SEK 10,367 million (11,685).

Financial investments were SEK 1,498 million (8,013).
The investments in 2015 were mainly related to the acqui-
sition of Tele2’s Norwegian mobile operations and shares
in Spotify Technology S.A.

Cash and cash equivalents totaled SEK 12,232 million
(13,558) at year-end. The balance sheet total was stable at
SEK 215,184 million (223,213), Shareholders’ equity was
SEK 80,286 million (82,901), of which non-restricted equity
SEK 64,573 million (67,189). The equity/assets ratio was
36.5 percent (35.7). As of December 31, 2016, the number
of employees was 273 (298).

PROPOSED APPROPRIATION OF
EARNINGS

At the disposal of the Annual General Meeting:

SEK
Retained earnings 54,206,643,071
Net income 10,366,679,823
Total 64,573,322,894

The Board proposes that this sum be appropriated as
follows:

SEK
SEK 2.00 per share ordinary dividend
to the shareholders 8,660, 169,562
To be carried forward 55,913,153,332
Total 64,573,322,894

The dividend should be split and distributed into two equal
tranches of SEK 1.00 each, one in April 2017 and one in
October 2017.

The Board of Directors has, according to Chapter 18
Section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act, assessed
whether the proposed dividend is justified. The Board of
Directors assesses that:

The parent company’s restricted equity and the group’s
total equity attributable to the shareholders of the parent
company, after the distribution of profits in accordance
with the proposal, will be sufficient in relation to the scope
of the parent company’s and the group’s business.

The proposed dividend does not jeopardize the parent
company’s or the group’s ability to make the investments
that are considered necessary. The proposal is consistent
with the established cash flow forecast under which the
parent company and the group are expected to manage
unexpected events and temporary variations in cash flows
to a reasonable extent.

The full statement by the Board of Directors on the same
will be included in the AGM documents.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

Telia Company operates in a broad range of geographical
product and service markets in the highly competitive and
regulated telecommunications industry. As a result, Telia
Company is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
Telia Company has defined risk as anything that could
have a material adverse effect on the achievement of Telia
Company's goals. Risks can be threats, uncertainties or
lost opportunities relating to Telia Company’s current or
future operations or activities.

Risk Description

Telia Company has an established risk management
framework in place to regularly identify, analyze, as-
sess and report business, financial as well as ethics and
sustainability risks and uncertainties, and to mitigate such
risks when appropriate. Risk management is an integrated
part of Telia Company’s business planning process and
monitoring of business performance.

Risks and uncertainties that could specifically impact
the quarterly results of operations during 2017 include, but
may not be limited to:

landscapes.

Potential impact

Vast amounts of data are generated in and through Telia
Company’s services and networks. New ways of connecting
and data-driven business models increase the complexity of
understanding and retaining control over how data is collected
and used. It is challenging to establish and maintain unas-
sailable privacy protection in increasingly sophisticated data
environments and in ever-changing legal, technical and threat

¢ Implementation of the EU General

Actual or perceived issues related to data network integrity,
data security and customer privacy may lead to an unfavour-
able perception of how Telia Company handles these matters,
which in turn may adversely impact business. Not meeting
national and EU legislation may cause significant financial
penalties.

Freedom of The telecommunications industry faces high risks related to
expression and the freedom of expression and privacy of users. Risks relate
privacy to how national laws and regulations on surveillance of com-

munications or shutdown of networks can be overly broad in
ways that violate human rights, and complicity by ICT compa-

nies in violations linked to major and problematic government (GNI)

Children online

Children and young people are active users of Telia Company's
services. However, children are particularly vulnerable to online
threats such as cyber bullying and inappropriate content. Telia
Company's services may also be used for distributing or access-
ing child sexual abuse material.

Potential impact

Telia Company may indirectly be complicit in violating children’s
rights if products and services as well as network filters are not
properly assessed. Actual or perceived failure to create a safe
online experience for children and young people may negatively
affect brand perception, incurring loss of business.

Occupational
health and safety
(OHS)

The most significant accident risks related to occupa-

tional health and safety (OHS) are linked to construction and
maintenance work carried out primarily by contractors. Telia
Company employees work mainly in office or retail environ-
ments where the main risks relate to psychosocial well-being
and ergonomics.

Potential impact

Failure to maintain a healthy and safety working environment
may lead to increasing sick leave, low employee engage-
ment and a higher number of accidents and injuries, incurring
increased costs and potential loss of critical competence.

¢ Implementation of OHSAS 18001 oc-

Ability to recruit
and retain skilled
employees

People is at the core of everything that we do and it is the
people with all their talents that will enable us to execute on
our strategy. There is an increased demand for talents in the
area of ICT and the competition is getting tougher. In order to
win the battle of talents Telia Company needs be great at at-
tract, recruit, and retain highly skilled employee to ensure the
demand and supply.

Potential impact

Failure to recruit and retain necessary skilled employees may
impact the ability to develop new or high growth business
areas and thereby deliver on the strategy.

° Efforts to build a strong employer
brand to ensure talent attraction

Establish a modern and efficient
global recruitment process

Providing internal growth

Environment

Climate change is increasingly driving regulation and taxation
related to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the use
of fossil fuels.

Potential impact

Increasing scarcity of natural resources, particularly rare
minerals used in network and consumer technology hardware,
may lead to increased hardware costs. Increasing energy
costs, greenhouse gas emissions taxation and price increases
caused by natural resource scarcity may incur additional
costs. As a consequence of climate change, extreme weather
conditions might be more common which may negatively
impact network performance and customer satisfaction.

Customer service
and network
quality

Telia Company focuses on offering high-quality services and
networks, which is fundamental to customer perception now
and in the future. The ambition to create a service company

on the customers’ terms requires a major internal change of
processes, attitude and focus in many parts of the company.
Additionally, Telia Company currently outsources many of

its key support services, including network construction and
maintenance in most of its operations.

Potential impact

Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters may cause
serious problems to network quality and availability. The
limited number of outsourced service suppliers, and the terms
of Telia Company's arrangements with current and future sup-
pliers, may restrict its operational flexibility and incur unneces-
sary costs. Failure to meet customers’ quality requirements

or expectations may have an adverse impact on customer
retention and acquisition.

Ensuring network resilience through

ment, business continuity planning
and incident management

° Agroup wide crisis management

* Continuous work to improve internal

cesses to fulfil customer expectations

* Customer satisfaction is continuously

standing of, and fulfil, customers’
expectations

Corruption and
unethical business
practices

Some of the countries in which Telia Company operates are
ranked as having high levels of corruption. The telecom-
munications industry is particularly susceptible to a range of
corrupt practices as it requires government approvals and
necessitates large investments. Key areas where the threat of
corruption is significant include the licensing process, market
regulation and price setting, the supply chain, and third-party
management and customer services.

Potential impact

Actual or perceived corruption or unethical business practices
may damage the perception of Telia Company and result in
financial penalties and debarment from procurement and insti-
tutional investment processes. Related fraud may significantly
impact financial results. Ongoing divestment processes may
in themselves pose risks of corruption, fraud and unethical
business practices.

° Anti-bribery and corruption (ABC)

compliance framework, implemented
in all parts of the organization

° “Responsible exit” plan for region
Eurasia containing actions to ensure

° Education and communication efforts

Responsible
procurement

Telia Company relies on a vast number of suppliers and sub-
suppliers, many of which are located in countries or indus-
tries with challenges in upholding ethical business practices,
human and labour rights, health and safety and environmental
protection. Despite efforts to conduct due diligence and onsite
audits, suppliers and sub-suppliers may be in violation of Telia
Company’s supplier requirements and/or national and interna-
tional laws, regulations and conventions.

Potential impact

Failure or perception of failure of Telia Company’s suppliers to
adhere to these rules and regulations may damage customers’
or other stakeholders’ perception of Telia Company. Violations
of laws and regulations puts suppliers and sub-suppliers at
risk of needing to limit or terminate their operations, which
may negatively affect how Telia Company is able to deliver

its services. Severe violations may lead to Telia Company
needing to seek new suppliers, which may negatively impact
procurement costs and delivery times.

° A standardized risk-based supplier
due diligence process implemented
and performed prior to signing new or
renewed contract

° Supplier code of conduct, which stip-
ulates our expectations on sustainable
business practices, is included in new
supplier contracts

° Security directives are included in

Global financial
markets unrest

Changes in the global financial markets are difficult to predict
but are affected by macroeconomics as well as political and
geopolitical developments. Telia Company operates in a
relatively non-cyclical or late cyclical industry and strongly
favor having a strong balance sheet, which is very important
through difficult times.

Potential impact

Asevere or long-term financial crisis may have an impact on
customers’ purchasing power and spending on ICT invest-
ments and services, which may negatively affect growth and
results of operations. Unfavorable changes in the global finan-
cial markets could limit the access to capital market funding
and may increase Telia Company's cost of funding. Unusually
high volatility in the foreign exchange market with fluctuations
of the currency rates have effects on the balance sheet and
the income statement.

° Maintaining a strong Investment grade
rating is key to ensure a good access
to diversified debt investor's and bank
funding

Important to forecast and manage
liquidity carefully to avoid any liquidity
shortage. By ensuring a smooth and
reasonably sized maturity profile of
the debt portfolio the refinancing risk

The main sources of funding is the
free cash flow from operations and
issuance in the capital markets. By
constantly monitoring the capital mar-
kets and take the opportunity to fund
in advance when market conditions
are favorable, the cost of funding can
be managed in an efficient and risk
adverse way

Telia Company has a committed
revolving credit facility supported by
13 core banks as a back-up for any
unexpected liquidity needs

Competition and
price pressure

Telia Company is subject to substantial and historically
increasing competition and price pressure. Competition has
from time to time led to increasing customer churn, decreasing
customer bases and to declines in the prices, Telia Company
charges for its products and services, and may have similar
effects in the future. Transition to new business models in

the ICT industry may lead to structural changes and different
competitive dynamics.

Potential impact

Failure to anticipate and respond to industry dynamics, and
to drive a change agenda to meet mature and developing
demands in the marketplace, may affect Telia Company's cus-
tomer relationships, service offerings and position in the value
chain. Competition from a variety of sources, including current
market participants, new entrants and new products and
services, may also adversely affect Telia Company’s results of
operations.

Afghanistan. In September 2015, Telia Company announced
its decision to reduce the presence in, and over time leave,
region Eurasia. Historically, the political, economic, legal and
regulatory systems in these countries have been less predict-
able than in developed markets. The nature of these markets,
including potential government intervention, combined with
the fact that the assets are not fully-owned and there are un-
dertakings and obligations in various shareholder agreements,
reputational issues regarding the assets and fewer potential
buyers than in more mature markets, makes the complexity of
these divestments processes high.

Potential impact
The political situation in these emerging markets may remain
or become increasingly unpredictable, even to the extent that
Telia Company will be forced to exit a country or a specific
operation within a country. There may be unexpected or
unpredictable litigation cases under civil or tax legislation.
Foreign exchange restrictions or administrative issues may
effectively prevent Telia Company from repatriating cash, e.g.
by receiving dividends and repayment of loans, or from selling
its investments. Another risk is the potential establishment
of foreign ownership restrictions or other formal or informal
possible actions against entities with foreign ownership. Such
negative developments or weakening of the local economies
or currencies may have a significantly negative effect on Telia
Company’s results of operations. The nature of these markets
with significant uncertainties and complexity may affect the
sales process regarding both expected outcome and timing.
The sanctions against the Russian Federation may negative-
ly affect the Russian ruble and the Russian economy, which

The financial performance of these associated companies may
have a significant impact on Telia Company’s short- and long-
term results. As part of its strategy, Telia Company may want
to increase or decrease its shareholdings in some of its as-

of factors, including factors beyond Telia Company's control,
such as willingness on the part of other existing shareholders
to dispose or accept dilution of their shareholdings and, in the
event Telia Company gains greater control, its ability to suc-
cessfully manage the relevant businesses. As they are jointly
controlled, there is a risk that the partners may disagree on
important matters, including funding of the operations which
may affect Telia Company’s position to act as planned. A
disagreement or deadlock or a breach by one of the parties of
the material provisions of the co-operation arrangements may
have a negative effect on Telia Company.

Factors generally affecting the telecom markets as well as
changes in the economic, regulatory, business or political
environment may negatively change management's expecta-

Potential impact

Significant adverse changes in the economic, regulatory, busi-

quently leading to an additional tax charge when such tax
asset is derecognized.

Regulation and
licenses

Telia Company operates in a highly regulated industry, and
regulations impose significant limits on Telia Company's flex-
ibility to manage its business. In a number of countries, Telia
Company entities are designated as a party with significant
market power in one or several telecom submarkets. As a
result, Telia Company is required to provide certain services on
regulated terms and prices, which may differ from the terms
on which it would otherwise have provided those services.
Effects from regulatory intervention may be both retroactive
and prospective.

Potential impact

Changes in regulation or government policy affecting Telia
Company’s business activities, as well as decisions by
regulatory authorities or courts, including granting, amending
or revoking of telecom licenses and spectrum permits, may
adversely affect Telia Company’s possibility of carrying out
business and subsequently results of operations.

Review of Eurasian
transactions

In late 2012, the then Board of Directors appointed Swedish
law firm Mannheimer Swartling (MSA) to investigate allega-
tions of corruption related to Telia Company’s investments

in Uzbekistan. MSA's report was made public on February 1,
2013. In April 2013, the Board of Directors assigned the inter-
national law firm Norton Rose Fulbright (NRF) to review trans-
actions and agreements made in Eurasia by Telia Company in
the past years with the intention to give the Board a clear pic-

ture of the transactions and a risk assessment from a business

ethics perspective. For advice on implications under Swed-
ish legislation, the Board assigned two Swedish law firms. In
consultation with the law firms, Telia Company has promptly
taken steps, and will continue to take steps, in its business
operations as well as in its governance structure and with its
personnel which reflect concerns arising from the review. The
Swedish Prosecution Authority’s investigation with respect
to Uzbekistan is still ongoing and Telia Company continues
to cooperate with and provide assistance to the Prosecutor.
If continued assessments and investigations would lead to
new observations and findings, it cannot be excluded that the
consequences of such findings would be that the results of
operations and financial position in Telia Company's opera-
tions in the Eurasian jurisdictions are adversely impacted.
Another risk is presented by the Swedish Prosecution
Authority's notification in the beginning of 2013 within the in-

vestigation of Telia Company's transactions in Uzbekistan, that
the Authority is separately investigating the possibility of seek-

ing a corporate fine against Telia Company, which under the
Swedish Criminal Act can be levied up to a maximum amount
of SEK 10 million per instance, and forfeiture of any proceeds
to Telia Company resulting from the alleged crimes.

* Telia Company will continue its nego-
tiations with the authorities

* Telia Company cooperate with and
continuously hand over information to
law enforcement agencies, who are
better equipped to assess whether
any criminal acts have occurred

Description Mitigating activities

Review of Eurasian
transactions
- Continued

The Swedish Prosecution Authority may take similar actions
with respect to transactions made or agreements entered into
by Telia Company relating to operations in its other Eurasian
markets, but it could be noted that the Swedish prosecutor
made a public statement in May 2016, that it had decided

not to investigate any other of Telia Company’s operations in
Eurasia. Further, actions taken, or to be taken, by the police,
prosecution or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions
against Telia Company’s operations or transactions, or against
third parties, whether they be Swedish or non-Swedish indi-
viduals or legal entities, might directly or indirectly harm Telia
Company’s business, results of operations, financial position,
cash flows or brand reputation. As examples, investigations
concerning bribery and money laundering in connection with
the transactions in Uzbekistan are conducted by the Dutch
prosecutor and police authorities, and by the US Department
of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
As requested by the Dutch authorities, Telia Company has
provided a bank guarantee of EUR 10 million as collateral for
any financial claims which may be decided against one of its
Dutch subsidiaries. Telia Company is cooperating fully with
the Dutch and US authorities and has done so since it was
informed of the investigations in March 2014 and has engaged
leading US and Dutch law firms as legal counsel for advice
and support. On September 14, 2016, Telia Company received
a proposal from the US and the Dutch authorities for financial
sanctions amounting to a total of approximately USD 1.45
billion or approximately SEK 12.5 billion at that point in time.

It is not at present possible to assess when the investigations
will be finally resolved. Telia Company has received requests
to make public the reviews made by NRF and other law firms.
However, despite risking criticism, it is not possible to publish
the reviews with respect to people, companies, business
agreements, privacy and thus the risk of Telia Company incur-
ring lawsuits as the law firms’ views are not necessarily shared
by those implicated.
