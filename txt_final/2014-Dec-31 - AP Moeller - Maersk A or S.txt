— Annual Report 2014

GROUP
HIGHLIGHTS

The Group delivered a strong financial
performance with a profit of USD 5.2bn (USD
3.8b6n) positively impacted by the USD 2.8bn
gain from the sale of the majority share of
Dansk Supermarked Group and other divest-
ment gains of USD 600m (USD 145m) partly
offset by the net impairments of USD 3.0bn
(USD 220m), including USD 1.76n on the Brazilian
oil assets. In line with expectations, the under-
lying profit increased by 33% to USD 4.5bn com-
pared to 2013 (USD 3.4bn) and the return on
invested capital (ROIC) was 11.0% (8.2%).

= Contents

Maersk Line maintained its lead on the rest of the industry
and delivered a higher than expected profit of USD 2.3bn (USD
1.5bn) due to stronger than expected volumes as well as lower
unit costs from continued optimisation and lower bunker prices
partly countered by lower freight rates. The underlying profit
was also higher than expected and came at USD 2.2bn (USD
1.5bn). ROIC was 11.6% (7.4%).

Maersk Oil delivered a loss of USD 861m (profit of USD 1.0bn)
but with an underlying profit of USD 1.0bn (USD 1.1bn) that was
in line with expectations despite the sharp decline in oil prices
during the fourth quarter. Maersk Oil's entitlement production
increased by 7% over 2013 to 251,000 barrels per day as a result
of improved operational performance, production from new
projects as well as a higher share of production from Qatar due
to the lower oil price. The result was furthermore improved
by lower exploration costs. Maersk Oil reduced its valuation of
Brazilian assets by USD 1.7bn due to disappointing exploration
and appraisal results and rising project costs. Updated oil price

Underlying result reconciliation

Result for the year

Gain on sale of non-

- continuing operations current assets, etc., net

assumptions lead to impairments on some of Maersk Oil's UK
assets. ROIC was negative 15.2% (positive 16.2%).

APM Terminals delivered a profit of USD $00m (USD 770m),
positively impacted by volume and margin growth as well as
divestment gains, mainly relating to the port in Virginia, USA.
The result was negatively impacted by impairments related to
activities in joint ventures. The underlying profit of USD 849m.
(USD 709m) was a significant improvement and in line with
expectations. ROIC was 14.7% (13.5%).

Maersk Drilling delivered a profit of USD 478m (USD 528m),
positively impacted by high operational uptimes as well as
gain relating to the divestment of the Venezuelan activities,
negatively impacted by impairments of USD 85m. The high
number of planned rig yard stay days and start-up costs con-
tributed negatively to the result. The underlying profit of USD
471m (USD 524m) was in line with expectations. ROIC was
7.1% (10.8%).

AP Moller - Maersk Group
— Annual Report 2014

APM Shipping Services delivered a loss of USD 230m (loss
of USD 85m) negatively impacted by a goodwill impairment
of USD 357m related to the Adsteam acquisition in Australia.
Svitzer's Australian operations are negatively impacted by
industry overcapacity, a high industry cost structure anda
general slowdown of bulk activities. Furthermore, the result
was impacted by significant non-trading costs in Damco re-
lated to impairments, restructuring and other adjustments.
The underlying result in APM Shipping Services came in
lower than expected, however, higher than last year with
an underlying profit of USD 185m (USD 37m) mainly due to
Maersk Tankers being impacted by positive USD 87m (nega-
tive USD 144m) relating to provision for onerous contracts.

The Group's cash flow from operating activities continued at
a high level of USD 8.8bn (USD 8.9bn) and net cash flow used
for capital expenditure increased to USD 6.2bn (USD 4.9bn)
mainly due to deliveries of newbuildings in Maersk Drilling
and Maersk Line as well as increased oil field developments
in Maersk Oil.

MAJOR PORTFOLIO DECISIONS

During 2014, the Group divested its majority shareholding in
Dansk Supermarked Group resulting in a gain of USD 2.8bn.
Furthermore, the Group announces its intention to offer its
shares in Danske Bank to its shareholders, and once com-
pleted the sale of shares in the Dansk Supermarked Group
and Danske Bank will have significantly contributed to focus-
ing the Group's portfolio.

SHAREHOLDER RETURN

The Maersk B-share price increased by 5.1% to DKK 12,370 dur-
ing 2014. The ordinary dividend pay-out proposed by the Board
of Directors is DKK 300 per share of DKK 1,000 equal to a total

of DKK 6,593m, representing an ordinary dividend yield of 2.4%
based on the B-share closing price at year end. The total value

= Contents

of the ordinary dividend payment is equivalent to USD 1,077m
at the exchange rate as per 31 December 2014.

The extraordinary dividend will be determined based on the
Volume Weighted Average Price of Danske Bank A/S’ shares
traded during a pricing period of five trading days, expected
to commence Friday 20 March and expire Thursday 26 March
2015. Based on the value of the shares on 31 December 2014,
the value of the extraordinary dividend is estimated to DKK
33,850m equivalent to USD 5,530m using the exchange rate as
per 31 December 2014 (around DKK 1,569 per share of DKK 1,000
excluding treasury shares). Due to the Group's strong financial
position, the Board of Directors decided in 2014 to buy back
shares of up to DKK 5.6bn to be executed during a 12-month
period beginning September 2014.The Board of Directors will
on an ongoing basis decide on the reoccurrence and size of
buy-back programmes based on the Group’s financial position
and the potential of identifying attractive investment opportu-
nities. AP. Maller Holding A/S is participating in the buy-back
with their pro rata share.

With an equity ratio of 61.3% (57.1%) and a liquidity reserve of
USD 11.6bn (USD 13.6bn), the Group is well prepared and deter-
mined to execute on its long term growth aspirations and seize
market opportunities within its businesses.

GUIDANCE
FOR 2015

The Group expects an underlying result
slightly below USD 4bn (USD 4.1bn)
excluding Danske Bank. Gross cash flow
used for capital expenditure is expected to
be around USD 9bn in 2015 (USD 8.7bn),
while cash flow from operating activities is

expected to develop in line with the result.

Forward-looking statements

The annual report contains forward-looking statements. Such
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as various
factors, many of which are beyond A.P. Maller - Meersk A/S’
control, may cause actual development and results to differ
materially from expectations contained in the Annual Report.

= Contents

Maersk Line expects a higher underlying result than for 2014
(USD 2.2bn). Maersk Line aims to improve its competitiveness
through unit cost reductions and implementation of the new
2M alliance. Global demand for seaborne container transporta-
tion is expected to increase by 3-5% and Maersk Line aims to
grow with the market.

Maersk Oil expects a significantly lower underlying result for
2015 than for 2014 (USD 1.0bn) as break even is reached with oil
prices in the range 55-60 USD per barrel.

Maersk Oil's entitlement production is expected to be around
265,000 boepd (251,000 boepd). Exploration expenses are ex-
pected to be around USD 0.7bn (USD 765m) for the year.

APM Terminals expects an underlying result around 2014
(USD 849m) and to grow in line with the market.

Maersk Drilling expects a higher underlying result than in
2014 (USD 471m) due to more rigs in operation, good forward
contract coverage as well as the cost reduction and efficiency
enhancement programme.

APM Shipping Services expects the underlying result for 2015
to be above the 2014 result (USD 185m).

SENSITIVITY GUIDANCE

The Group's guidance for 2015 is subject to considerable uncer-
tainty, not least due to developments in the global economy,
the container freight rates and the oil price.

The Group's expected underlying result depends on a number
of factors. Based on the expected earnings level and all other
things being equal, the sensitivities on calendar 2015 for four
key value drivers are listed in the table below:

Effect on the Group's

Factors Change underlying profit

+/-USD 0.25bn

Oil price for Maersk +/-10 USD/barrel

Bunker price +/-100 USD/tonne -/+USD 0.2bn
Container freight rate +/-100 USD/FFE +/-USD 1.0bn
Container freight volume +/-100,000 FFE +/-USD 0.1bn

THE GROUP
STRATEGY

The Group is executing on the strategy
to become a premium conglomerate with
five of our eight businesses now world-class
performers in their industries.

ciency and performance.

active portfolio and performance management, disciplined
capital allocation and a clear financial strategy.

We use our global network, skilled people and financial flexi-
bility to enable customers and countries to create wealth and

support and capitalise on the growth.

The Group’s financial ambition is to develop its business units
and achieve above 10% ROIC over the cycle.

As a group, our business success is built on a number of
strengths: Our size and global reach, our financial flexibility,
our talented employees, our time-honoured values, our com-
mitment to safety and sustainability and our drive to innovate.

continued profitable growth.

THE GROUP STRATEGY PROCESS

The Board of Directors performs an annual strategy review to
ensure that the Group's strategy is regularly assessed accord-
ing to market developments, including developments in the oil
price.

The Group's annual strategy review and the allocation of capi-
tal is a fully integrated process.

Strategies, including detailed plans and opportunities for the
coming years are developed for each business unit.

The total capital requirements across businesses are prior-
itised with a view to optimise the portfolio of the Group and
in line with financial policies. Evaluation parameters include
industry attractiveness, financial return forecasts, business
performance and overall strategic aspirations. The resulting
plan provides the framework for each business unit. Portfolio
adjustments are integrated into the plan.

The integrated Group strategy review, portfolio actions and
capital prioritisation process starts at the beginning of the
year. The Board of Directors have their annual strategy confer-
ence at which the Board discusses proposals put forward by
the Executive Board and decides on the strategy.

The outcome of the Board of Directors’ annual strategy confer-
ence will, as in previous years, be communicated in connection
with the Group's interim report for the second quarter of 2015.
The outcome will be available for download from:
http://investor.maersk.com/financials.cfm

THE GROUP'S PRIORITIES FOR 2015
We have set out the following Group Priorities for 2015:

Position our company for a new oil environment

The recent steep decline in the oil price means we must adapt
our business to fit this new reality. Cost reductions will be
critical to maintaining and improving competitiveness across
the Group.

Differentiate through technology and innovation

Better use of technology and innovation is critical to main-
taining our competitive edge in the digital age. This will be an
important driver for reducing cost as well as enhancing our
customer experience.

Define growth platforms for the future

While we must not lose focus on our core capabilities we also
need to identify the areas where we see our future growth
stemming from. These could be related to our current busi-
nesses or in entirely new areas.

EXECUTION
ON GROUP
STRATEGY
2014

The Group will create value through
profitable growth and by creating winning
businesses. The Group seeks to improve
the return on invested capital (ROIC) by
focused and disciplined capital allocation,
portfolio optimisation and performance
management. The Group intends to share
the value creation by growing ordinary
dividends in nominal terms and through
initiation of our first share-buy-back pro-
gramme in 2014.

= Contents

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

The Group is focused on performance management, both to-
wards the specific long term goals established for each business
unit, as well as on the current operational performance across
arange of key performance indicators. Financial targets are set
both in absolute terms, as well as relative to the industry.

Target/policy

* To develop world class businesses that achieve above
10% ROIC over the cycle.

¢ Be top quartile performers in their industry.

Developments in 2014

Maersk Line, APM Terminals and Maersk Supply Service
achieved a ROIC above 10%.

Maersk Line, Maersk Oil, APM Terminals, Maersk Supply
Service and Svitzer are top quartile performers in their
industries.

Below top quartile performance are Maersk Drilling,
Maersk Tankers and Damco. For Maersk Drilling this is
due to the high number of drilling rigs on yard stays,
however, the operational performance for Maersk Drilling
‘was top quartile.

Performance in APM Shipping Services was diverse with
two business units (Maersk Supply Service and Svitzer)

delivering top quartile performance, while two performed
below (Maersk Tankers and Damco), albeit with Maersk
Tankers performing considerably above the industry
average.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND GROWTH
The Group has an ambition to grow its invested capital, mainly
by executing the investment pipeline.

Maersk Drilling and APM Terminals have seen the largest rel-
ative increase in their invested capital since 02 2012, driven
by acquisitions and investments in terminals and rigs.

Maersk Oil has spent more than USD 1bn per year on explo-
ration in 2012 and 2013; less in 2014. Due to the disappointing
exploration results over the last couple of years Maersk Oil
has decided to reduce its exploration activities, but also con-
sider other means to grow reserves and future production for
example by buying shares of existing discoveries or fields.

Following a number of years with poor market conditions for
Maersk Tankers, it was decided to divest the VLCC segment,
thereby significantly decreasing their invested capital.

Target/policy

° 75% of the Group's invested capital is to be invested in Maersk
Line, Maersk Oil, APM Terminals and Maersk Drilling.

¢ The total invested capital is to grow towards USD 55-60bn
by 2017.

Line, Maersk Oil, APM Terminals and Maersk Drilling

(68% in Q2 2012).

The invested capital dropped by 5.3% since 02 2012, adversely
impacted by the sale of Dansk Supermarked Group and the
USD 3.0bn impairments, including USD 2.2bn in Maersk Oil,
of which USD 1.7bn related to the Brazilian assets recognised
in 2014.

71% of all outstanding capital commitments are dedicated
to growth in Maersk Oil, APM Terminals and Maersk Drilling.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

The Group is focused on developing the Group's strong positions
in growth markets, and exit businesses that do not support the
future strategy.

Target/policy

* To actively manage the portfolio of businesses to ensure
focus on the most profitable and least volatile business areas.

¢ Building a balanced portfolio across several businesses.

« Execute a focused capital allocation.

Developments in 2014

¢ Cash flow from divestments of USD 4.4bn. Primarily:
—The majority share in Dansk Supermarked Group.

— APM Terminals Virginia, Portsmouth, USA.

Arevised strategy for Maersk Oil, Brazil as resource esti-
mates was significantly reduced.

Following the decline in oil price, we revised our strategy
in Maersk Oil to focus on less expensive resources as well
as cost savings. Based on our extensive experiences from
shipping, the Group is well-prepared for a sharper cost
focus, and both Maersk Oil and Maersk Drilling have em-
barked on initiatives to drive down costs.

« Exit the Very Large Crude Carriers segment.

¢ Divestment of drilling activities in Venezuela.

FUNDING

The Group's capital structure and liquidity reserve are
managed in line with the Group's current Baal/BBB+ credit
rating.

All debt financing is arranged centrally and the Group gener-
ally intends to raise funding at the parent company level from
diversified sources including bonds, which accounted for 37%
of gross debt as of 31 December 2014.

Target/policy

¢ Secure long term commitments.

¢ Obtain funding from diversified sources.

¢ Secure an adequate liquidity reserve at all times.

Developments in 2014

¢ The Group raised around USD 6.6bn in new financing,
including the first issuance of USD bonds (USD 1.3bn)
and the refinancing of the revolving credit facility of
USD 5.1bn.

¢ Aplanned decreased liquidity reserve by USD 2.0bn to
USD 11.6bn.

¢ Loans and leases with a total principal amount of USD 2.1bn
were repaid before maturity during 2014.

DIVIDEND

The Group may in periods have a stronger financial position
than what is needed to fund the strategic development and

retain financial flexibility over a longer period of time. In these
periods, the Group will evaluate the need for capital and will

consider how to manage excess capital.

Dividend is the Group's primary distribution of capital to our
shareholders. The nominal dividend has increased steadily
over the last decade.

Target/policy

FINANCIAL
REVIEW

The Group's profit for the year was
USD 5.2bn (USD 3.8bn) and the equity
totalled USD 42.2bn (USD 42.5bn).

The review of the financial statement is carried out
through the presentation of the Group’s businesses.

= Contents

INCOME STATEMENT

Revenue increased to USD 47.6bn (USD 47.4bn), primarily
due to higher container volumes at lower freight rates as

well as higher oil entitlement production at a lower average
oil price.

Profit increased by USD 1.4bn to USD 5.2bn (USD 3.8bn) impacted
by the USD 2.8bn gain from the sale of the majority share of
Dansk Supermarked Group and other divestment gains of USD
600m (USD 145m) partly offset by the net impairments after
tax of USD 2.2bn primarily related to the Brazilian oil assets of
USD 1.7bn, UK oil assets USD 188m, and goodwill in Svitzer USD
357m. Last year was negatively impacted by net impairments
of USD 220m mainly related to Maersk Tankers.

Due to improved performance in Danske Bank, the Group's 2008
impairment of USD 202m was reversed in 04 2014.

Further comments to the profit development are provided per
segment below.

MAERSK LINE PERFORMANCE
Maersk Line made a profit of USD 2.3bn (USD 1.5bn) and a ROIC
of 11.6% (7.4%). The underlying profit was USD 2.2bn or 50%
higher than last year (USD 1.5bn).

The EBIT margin gap to peers was estimated at around 9%,
which was significantly above the 5% ambition level. The
achievement came from 5.4% lower unit costs mainly due to
improved network efficiencies and lower bunker price. Effi-
ciencies were achieved through increased volumes in line with
market as well as continued vessel network optimisation and
active capacity management. Average freight rates decreased
by 1.6% to 2,630 USD/FFE (2,674 USD/FFE) and volumes in-
creased by 6.8% to 9,442k FFE (8,839k FFE). Bunker consump-
tion in kg/FFE was reduced by 7.9% and bunker prices de-
creased by 5.7%.

Recognised freight revenue was USD 25.0bn (USD 23.7bn) and
other revenue was USD 2.4bn (USD 2.5bn).

To minimise the impact of the low and volatile freight rate en-
vironment, Maersk Line continued to absorb capacity by active
capacity management in the form of idling, slow steaming and
blanked sailings.

Maersk Line increased the fleet capacity to 2.9m TEU (2.6m
TEU) by end of 2014 mainly due to delivery of 11 Triple-E ves-
sels. Five Triple-E vessels suited for the Asia-Europe trade are
on order for delivery during first half of 2015. No newbuilding
orders were placed during 2014.

Cash flow from operating activities increased by USD 387m to
USD 4.1bn compared to 2013. Cash flow used for capital expend-
iture increased by USD 367m to a total of USD 2.0bn primarily
related to the Triple-E newbuildings and containers, leaving a
free cash flow of USD 2.1bn on par with 2013.

MAERSK OIL PERFORMANCE

Maersk Oil reported a loss of USD 861m (profit of USD 1.0bn)
and a ROIC of negative 15.2% (positive 16.2%) with an under-
lying profit of USD 1.0bn (USD 1.1bn).

The result was negatively affected by net impairments after

tax of USD 1.9bn of which USD 1.7bn related to Brazilian assets
while the rest primarily related to the UK. The income for 2013
included insurance compensation of USD 205m primarily re-
lated to Gryphon.

The underlying result for 2014 was 4% lower than last year
mainly due to 9% lower average prices of USD 99 per barrel
versus USD 109 per barrel in 2013. This was partly offset by
7% higher entitlement production 251,000 boepd (235,000
boepd) and 33% lower exploration costs USD 765m (USD
1.1bn). The increased entitlement production came primarily

1210 >


--- Page 11 ---

AP Moller - Maersk Group
— Annual Report 2014

from the UK (34%) and Algeria (31%) partly offset by a decline
in Denmark (8%). Operating expenses (excluding exploration
costs) increased by 14% to USD 2.8bn (USD 2.5bn) compared
to 2013; however the majority of the increase was related to
directly recoverable costs and hence with limited impact on
the underlying result.

Both Golden Eagle in the UK and Jack in the US Gulf of Mexico
came on stream in 04 2014. Maersk Oil completed 14 exploration
and appraisal wells of which 11 were dry. The successful wells
were Marconi in the UK, Buckskin in the US Gulf of Mexico and
one Johan Sverdrup appraisal well in Norway. Due to disap-
pointing exploration results in the past couple of years coupled
with a prolonged depressed oil price scenario, Maersk Oil de-
cided to reduce its exploration activities.

Cash flow from operating activities was USD 2.6bn (USD 3.2bn),
negatively affected by lower oil prices and increase in operating
costs, however, partly offset by higher entitlement production
and lower exploration costs. Cash flow used for capital expend-
iture increased to USD 2.2bn (USD 1.8bn) mainly as a result of
overall increased development activities.

The development project at the Al Shaheen field offshore Qatar
is progressing as planned and was with 22 wells completed
by the end of 2014 almost half way through the drilling pro-
gramme. Preparation for the further development is being dis-
cussed with Oatar Petroleum.

In Angola, tender bids for the Chissonga project have been

received. With the low oil price, the project is challenged and
negotiations with authorities, partners and contractors are
ongoing.

The high pressure — high temperature gas field Culzean off

shore UK is progressing towards expected sanctioning mid-
2015 and production start-up in 2019.

= Contents

A development plan for Phase 1 of the Johan Sverdrup project off
shore Norway was submitted to the authorities on 13 February
2015 and sanctioning is expected mid-2015. Maersk Oil's share
of the resources is 8.12%; however, the final resource allocation
is subject to approval by the Norwegian authorities. For Phase
1, Maersk Oil's share of the costs are expected to be approxi-
mately USD 1.8 bn and the production share is expected at a level
of 28,000 boepd.

The yearly update of Maersk Oil's reserves and resources as

per end of 2013 showed entitlement reserves and resources

(2P+2C) of 1.47bn barrels of oil equivalent (1.36bn boe) includ-
ing proved and probable (2P) reserves of 0.60bn barrels of oil
equivalent (0.62bn boe). 2014 reserves and resources numbers
will be released in connection with the interim report for the
first quarter 2015.

APM TERMINALS PERFORMANCE

APM Terminals made a profit of USD 300m (USD 770m) and
a ROIC of 14.7% (13.5%) with an underlying profit of USD 849m
(USD 709m).

The result was positively impacted by net divestment gains
after tax of USD 232m (USD 62m) and negatively affected by
USD 181m (USD Om) impairments related to European activities
of which USD 154m was related to joint venture companies.

The increased underlying profit came as a result of the number
of containers handled by APM Terminals (weighted with APM
Terminals’ ownership interest) growing in line with the market
by 5.3% to 38.3m TEU (36.3m TEU) supported by terminals be-
coming fully operational and broad growth across the portfolio.
The volumes from customers outside the Group grew by 3.5%.
Total revenue increased by 2.8%, port revenue exceeded the
volume growth and revenue from inland services decreased
due to divestment of activities in the Americas and Asia as part
of continued efforts to optimise the portfolio.

Volume growth was partially impacted by the sale of APM
Terminals Virginia, Portsmouth, USA and Terminal Porte
Océane, Le Havre, France. In addition, the sale of 29% voting
right in APM Terminals Callao SA, Peru, was completed, as well
as the sale of a24% share of APM Terminals Zeebrugge, Belgium.

Construction of Maasvlakte II, The Netherlands has been com-
pleted and operations have commenced, with expected volume
ramp up during 2015. A new terminal project was secured in
Namibe, Angola through APM Terminals’ interest in Sociedade
Gestora de Terminais S.A. (Sogester), Angola.

Despite inflationary pressure in growth markets, the EBITDA-
margin improved by 2.1% supported by commercial and opera-
tional efficiencies resulting in revenue improvements and cost
savings generating more than USD 100m primarily through the
retendering of several supplier contracts and continuous im-
provement initiatives across the portfolio.

Cash flow from operating activities of USD 925m (USD 923m)
was impacted negatively by tax payments of USD 142m related
to divestment gains as well as slightly deteriorating working
capital. Cash flow used for capital expenditure was more than
offset by cash flow generated from divestments leading to a
net positive cash flow from capital expenditure of USD 2m
(negative USD 841m).

APM Terminals continued a high level of investment in the de-
velopment of its port interests both in the form of new projects
and expansions to existing ports. Invested capital came in at
USD 5.9bn (USD 6.2bn) a decrease of 4% compared to the previ-
ous year due to divestments.

MAERSK DRILLING PERFORMANCE

Maersk Drilling reported a profit of USD 478m (USD 528m)
and a ROIC of 7.1% (10.8%). The underlying profit was USD 471m
(USD 524m).

413/10 >

AP Moller - Maersk Group
— Annual Report 2014

The result was positively impacted by a gain of USD 73m from
the divestment of all activities in Venezuela and high opera-
tional uptime across the fleet, while planned maintenance of the
fleet, start-up of new rigs and impairments negatively impacted
the result. As a result of the weakened market for offshore rigs
Maersk Drilling made an impairment of USD 85m (USD 74m
after tax) of which USD 50m (USD 38m after tax) relates to the
joint venture Egyptian Drilling Company in Egypt.

All of Maersk Drillings 21 jack-up and floater rigs have been on
contract throughout 2014. The overall higher revenue was sup-
ported by 100% contract coverage and by a high operational
performance across the rig fleet with average uptime 97% (97%)
for the jack-up rigs and 96% (96%) for the floating rigs.

By the end of 2014, Maersk Drillings’ forward contract coverage
was 80% for 2015, 52% for 2016 and 30% for 2017. The total revenue
backlog by the end of 2014 amounted to USD 6.0bn (USD 7.9bn).

Operating costs increased due to additional start-up costs for
the five newbuildings with contract commencement during
2014 and the remaining three newbuildings to be delivered dur-
ing 2015 and 2016. The cost level on the existing fleet excluding
newbuildings was on par with cost in 2013.

Five yard stays for planned surveys and upgrades were com-
pleted in 2014. Further, two offshore class surveys and upgrade
programmes were completed in 2014.

Maersk Drilling took delivery of five newbuilds, including three
ultra deepwater drillships and two ultra-harsh environment
jack-up rigs during 2014. Maersk Drilling has three rigs under
construction with two to be delivered in first quarter of 2015
and one in 2016.

The lower cash flow from operating activities of USD 701m

(USD 775m) was mainly related to the higher operating costs
combined with an increase in net working capital due to the

= Contents

higher activity level from five more rigs operating end of 2014
compared to 2013. Cash flow used for capital expenditures of
USD 2.2bn was USD 643m higher than last year mainly due to
instalments paid for the newbuildings.

APM SHIPPING SERVICES PERFORMANCE

APM Shipping Services made a loss of USD 230m (loss of USD
85m) and a negative ROIC of 4.2% (negative 1.3%). The underly-
ing profit was USD 185m (USD 37m).

Maersk Supply Service reported an improved profit of USD
201m (USD 187m) and a ROIC of 11.9% (10.7%). The underlying
profit was USD 189m (USD 182m).

The 2014 result was positively impacted by a strong second
half of the year after a challenging first half. In the third quarter
the market improved significantly, especially for large Anchor
Handling Tug Supply Vessels (AHTS), and in combination
with sales gains Maersk Supply Service reached a 2014 result
slightly above the previous year.

Maersk Supply Service entered the year with good contract
coverage and during the year concluded a number of new long
term contracts as well as extensions in key markets covering
Africa, Australia, Brazil, Canada as well as the North Sea where
the majority of the fleet is employed. Contract coverage going
into 2015 is 50% and 29% for 2016 excluding options.

Operating costs were USD 430m (USD 423m) with the increase
mainly driven by modification projects, higher repair and main-
tenance costs as well as increased stores cost. This was partly
offset by lower commissions.

During the year Maersk Supply Service sold four vessels result-
ing in sales gains of USD 12m (USD 5m).

As part of the extensive investment plans Maersk Supply Service
has been active ordering vessels to support the growth strategy

focusing on high-end AHTS and Subsea Support Vessels (SSVs).
A total of 11 newbuildings were ordered during the year (one
Cable Layer, four SSVs and six AHTS). Consequently cash flow
used for capital expenditure increased to USD 188m (USD 81m).
Cash flow from operations remained nearly unchanged at USD
356m (USD 360m).

Maersk Tankers made a profit of USD 132m (loss of USD 317m)
and a positive ROIC of 6.8% (negative 10.4%). The underlying
profit was USD 139m (loss of USD 172m).

The result was positively affected by improved earnings for
the LR2 and VLCC segments, cost saving initiatives and rever-
sal of provision for onerous contracts of USD 87m (provision of
USD 144m), offset by lower activity following the divestment of
the Gas segment in 2013.

Time charter equivalent (TCE) earnings in the VLCC segment
improved, particular in the first half of the year and kept stable
throughout 2014. Average TCE earnings in the Product segments
increased with 4% compared to 2013 driven by LR2. Total TCE
earnings were negatively impacted by the divestment of the
Gas segment in 2013 and the gradual delivery of the VLCC ves-
sels to its new owners.

Operating cost decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 as a re-
sult of cost saving initiatives contributing positively with USD
22m, the divestment of the Gas and VLCC segments and rever-
sal of the provision for onerous contracts.

Depreciation and amortisation decreased by USD 63m com-
pared with 2013, driven by the divestment of the Gas and
VLCC segments. Net impairments in 2014 were USD 4m (USD
153m).

Cash flow from operating activities was USD 232m (USD 223m),

positively impacted by improved operating margin and reduc-
tion in net working capital, offset by the lower activity from the

— Annual Report 2014

reduced fleet. Net cash flow from capital expenditures was pos-
itive USD 650m (positive USD 748m), primarily driven by the
divestments of the VLCC segment.

Damco made a loss of USD 293m (loss of USD 111m) anda
ROIC of negative 63.2% (negative 22.0%). The result was im-
pacted by significant impairment losses of USD 68m (USD
6m), mainly related to goodwill and other acquired intangible
assets as well as reduced profitability in the ocean and air-
freight activities despite an improving but still unsatisfactory
overhead cost level.

Revenue was USD 3.2bn (USD 3.2bn) with volumes growing
by 11% for Supply Chain Management whereas the ocean
freight volumes declined by 6% and airfreight volumes fell by
16%. Margins in all three segments were under pressure and
declined through 2014.

The additional visibility achieved through standard system
roll-outs and the strengthening of the control framework re-

vealed further exposures in certain geographies and product
categories. This resulted in several adjustments which im-

pacted the result negatively.

The restructuring initiatives and roll-out of the new operating
platform have proven more complex than originally anticipated,
generating delays in getting the planned productivity improve-
ments to materialise. Consequently, overhead cost has remained
above the desired level and additional organisational rightsizing
was initiated during 2014, adding more restructuring cost with
benefits expected for 2015 and onwards. The restructuring
initiatives are expected to strengthen commercial competitive-
ness and get Damco back to profitable growth in 2015.

Cash flow from operating activities was negative USD 201m

(negative USD 14m) due to the result development and increased
working capital following the roll-out of a new operating system.

= Contents

Svitzer made a loss of USD 270m (profit of USD 156m) anda
ROIC of negative 19.2% (positive 10.8%). The underlying profit
was USD 82m (USD 134m).

The result development was affected by net impairment of USD

354m (USD 6m) primarily goodwill related to the 2007 Adsteam

acquisition in Australia. Svitzer's Australian operations are neg-
atively impacted by industry overcapacity, a high industrial cost
structure and a general slowdown of bulk activities.

The underlying result was impacted by writedown of long out-
standing salvage receivables and a provision for redundancies
in the harbor towage segment.

Revenue was USD 812m (USD 831m) with growth seen in new ac-
tivities in Europe countered by a negative impact from competi-
tion in Australia together with a general slowdown in Australian
bulk ports and the divestment of Svitzer's spot fleet in Asia.

Terminal towage developed satisfactory, however overall prof-
its were negatively impacted by the sale of two joint ventures
in 2013.

Low levels of emergency response activity in the salvage market
continued throughout 2014.

Cost increased by USD 28m primarily due to start-up of new op-
erations and terminal towage projects, and due to a general cost
increase in Australia. In 2014, Svitzer launched programmes to
improve crew and onshore productivity with further savings to
materialise in 2015.

Cash flow from operating activities increased to USD 203m

(USD 180m) driven by improved collection of receivables partly
offset by lower operating result and higher tax. Cash flow from
investing activities increased to USD 235m (USD 2m) mainly due
to investments in vessels for new terminal towage contracts as

well as replacement vessels. Investments in 2013 were offset
by the sale of joint ventures.

OTHER BUSINESSES

Other businesses made a profit of USD 408m (USD 400m). The
primary contributor was the Group's share of the result in Danske
Bank of USD 330m compared to USD 254m in 2013. The Group's
share of underlying result in Danske Bank was USD 449m, ex-
cluding the bank's impairment of USD 321m and reversal of the
Group's 2008 goodwill impairment of USD 202m. The remaining
activities were primarily affected by divestment activities in 2013.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Dansk Supermarked Group contributed with a profit of USD
2.96n (USD 394m). Excluding divestment gain, the profit was
USD 81m (USD 394m).

UNALLOCATED ACTIVITIES

Unallocated activities comprise revenue and cost, etc. whichis
not attributed to reportable segments, including purchase of
bunker and lubricating oil on behalf of companies in the Group
as well as financial items. The financial items were negative by
USD 606m (negative by USD 716m); the decrease in net financial
expenses was primarily driven by lower net interest expenses
due to lower net debt, lower interest rates and higher capitalised
borrowing costs.

TAX

Companies in the Group are taxed under different tax regimes,
depending on location and activity. Special tax rules apply to
some of the Group's activities.

As a general rule, shipping activities are subject to a tonnage

based or similar tax system, under which the computation of
taxable income includes an amount calculated on the basis of the
fleet's tonnage. Moreover, in certain countries freight taxes are
paid mainly based on the gross freight income in those countries.

415/10 >

AP Moller - Maersk Group
— Annual Report 2014

In most countries, oil and gas activities are subject to a special
form of taxation, which is often considerably higher than the
normal corporate tax rate.

The total tax charge for the Group in 2014 was USD 3.0bn (USD
3.2bn) of which taxes payable to Denmark were USD 0.8bn (USD
1.1bn). The amounts related to the special hydrocarbon tax were
USD 0.5bn (USD 0.6bn) and USD 0.3bn (USD 0.5bn) represented
corporate tax on oil activities. The decrease in the special hydro-
carbon tax was largely due to the drop in oil prices. The shipping
activities’ tax payment to Denmark was USD 13m (USD 20 m).

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

Comprehensive income for the year was USD 3.6bn (USD 4.3bn)
and includes the profit for the year of USD 5.2bn (USD 3.8bn)
and other comprehensive income which was negative by USD
1.6bn (positive by USD 0.5bn). Other comprehensive income
mainly includes exchange rate adjustment on translation
from functional currency to presentation currency, fair value
adjustment of certain securities, value adjustment of cash flow
hedges and actuarial gains and losses.

BALANCE SHEET
At 31 December 2014, total assets amounted to USD 68.8bn
(USD 74.5bn).

Intangible assets decreased to USD 2.8bn (USD 4.8bn), mainly
due to the impairment of USD 1.7bn on the Brazilian oil rights.

Property, plant and equipment of USD 44.7bn (USD 41.3bn) in-
creased by USD 3.4bn with investments in the year of USD 8.9bn.
(USD 6.9bn). Depreciation for the year was USD 4.2bn (USD
4.3bn) and net impairment losses of USD 421m (USD 165m)
were recognised. Sale of tangible assets amounted to USD 512m
(USD 4.9bn) including the transfer to held for sale in 2013 of
the Dansk Supermarked Group. Currency adjustments resulted
ina decrease of USD 399m (decrease of USD 91m).

= Contents

Shares in associated companies decreased to USD 839m (USD
6.4bn) primarily due to the reclassification of the Danske Bank
shares to held for sale.

Derivatives were as of 31 December 2014 a net liability of
USD 500m (net asset of USD 125m). The movement was pri-
marily related to the USD appreciating against main hedging
currencies.

Cash and cash equivalents totalled USD 3.5bn (USD 3.3bn) at
31 December 2014, including offsetting bank overdrafts of USD
102m (USD 102m).

Assets held for sale of net USD 5.3bn (USD 6.9bn) comprised
assets expected to be sold during 2015 including the shares in

Danske Bank.

Equity totalled USD 42.2bn (USD 42.5bn). The decrease was re-

lated to the sale of the Dansk Supermarked Group of USD 2.1bn,

the share buy-back of USD 653m, exchange rate adjustments
of USD 1.2bn, cash flow hedges of USD 288m and dividend paid
USD 1.3bn (USD 1.1bn). The reduction was partly offset by the
profit for the year of USD 5.2bn.

The actuarial net liability for pensions, etc. in relation to de-
fined benefit plans recognised totalled USD 217m (USD 261m) at
31 December 2014. Developments in the actuarial assumptions
as well as changes to the minimum funding requirements re-
sulted in actuarial losses of USD 9m (gains of USD 50m), which
are included in other comprehensive income. In 2014, the Group
paid USD 81m (USD 68m) to defined benefit plans.

Deferred tax liabilities totalled USD 701m (USD 1.1bn) at 31 De-
cember 2014, and recognised deferred tax assets totalled USD
536m (USD 478m). Furthermore, deferred tax assets of USD
1.5bn (USD 812m) have not been recognised, cf. note 9 to the
consolidated financial statements.

CASH FLOW

Cash flow from operating activities USD 8.8bn (USD 8.9bn) was
negatively impacted by increased tax payments of USD 466m.
which was partly offset by improved working capital as well as
less interest paid.

Cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 6.2bn (USD
49bn). The increase was mainly due to higher investments in
Maersk Drilling, Maersk Line and Maersk Oil. Cash flow from
financing activities was negative by USD 4.7bn (negative by
USD 2.6bn) impacted by larger repayments of loans following
the sale of Dansk Supermarked Group.

OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS

The present value of the operating lease commitments totalled

USD 7.70n at 31 December 2014 (USD 8.7bn at 31 December 2013)

using a discount rate of 6% (6%). The amount is divided into the

following main items:

e Maersk Line and Maersk Tankers of USD 3.8bn (USD 4.6bn)
primarily relating to vessels on time charter

¢ APM Terminals of USD 3.1bn (USD 3.2bn) primarily related
to future concession fees for port facilities

e Other commitments of USD 0.8bn (USD 0.9bn).

About one-third of the time charter payments in Maersk Line
and in Maersk Tankers are estimated to relate to operational
costs for the assets. Please refer to note 17 in the consolidated
financial statements for an overview of maturity.

PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The activities of the parent company comprise primarily the oil
and gas activities in the Danish sector of the North Sea. In addi-
tion activities include the holding of shares in subsidiaries and

associated companies and the Group's Finance Department.

In the parent company financial statements, shares in sub-
sidiaries and associated companies are recognised at cost, less
impairment losses, and in the income statement, dividends
from subsidiaries and associated companies are recognised as
income.

Profit for the year was USD 8.0bn (USD 1.3bn), primarily im-
pacted by gain on sale of Dansk Supermarked Group.

At 31 December 2014, total assets amounted to USD 54.2bn
(USD 51.1bn) and equity totalled USD 27.2bn (USD 21.1bn).

Maersk Line activities have been transferred to a fully owned

subsidiary in 2015 and are classified as held for sale and discon-
tinued operations in the parent company in 2014. Comparative

figures have been restated for the income statement and cash
flow statement.

Assets held for sale primarily consist of Maersk Line activities
and the investment in Danske Bank.

Cash flow from operating activities was USD 0.6bn (USD 1.1bn).
Working capital items, financial expenses paid and taxes paid
improved, while dividends received and financial income re-
ceived decreased.

RISK
MANAGEMENT

Framework In 2014 a revised Enterprise Risk
Management (ERM) framework was rolled out,
enabling and supporting a consistent, robust
and focused approach to assessing the three
main categories comprising the Group's risk
universe, namely the Known Risks, Emerging
Risks and Portfolio Risks. The three pillars are
explored through a combination of risk report-
ing, internal reviews, external expert input and
analysis.

The main findings are presented to the Executive
Board as well as the Board of Directors, and
serve as input to the annual strategic review
and capital allocation processes.

= Contents

The Audit Committee annually reviews the process for poten-
tial improvements and further development of the Group risk
management approach. In conjunction with the further de-
velopment of ERM processes and deepening integration of the
framework, the Committee continues to emphasise its focus
on progressing ERM within the Group.

KNOWN RISKS

Known risks are considered actual risks to business objec-
tives within the planning period, 2015-2020. While some risks
are integral in the industries we operate in and are therefore
accepted as part of our operations and managed accordingly,
several such risks continue to have the potential of adversely
impacting our business in the short to medium term, such as:

Asharp and prolonged drop in oil prices constitutes a risk as we
are increasingly targeting technologically demanding and costly
industry segments. The recent substantial decline in the oil price
during the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015, has led to reduced
cash flows primarily from our oil and drilling operations. Depend-
ing on market developments, it may jeopardise the longer term
strategy of securing commercially viable contacts for Maersk
Drilling and delivering on our 2020 target of 400 thousand barrels
of daily entitlement production in Maersk Oil. Ultimately this
could impact our ability to meet our financial targets.

The Board of Directors perform an annual strategy review to en-
sure that the Group's strategy is regularly assessed according to
market developments including developments in the oil price.

A major accident or oil spill remains an inherent risk in the
Group's operations, particularly in the oil and gas, offshore and
tanker businesses. A high severity incident would first and fore-
most present a risk to our employees as well as potentially the
marine environment, wildlife and local community. Additionally
it could result in large scale impact on assets, cash position, and
reputation and put our licence to operate at risk. The Group is
supporting incident free operations to mitigate this risk.

A major cyber-attack could prove crucial to our ability to oper-
ate and deliver on our commitments, as the Group is involved
in complex and wide ranging global services, making it highly
dependent on well-functioning IT-systems. Business disrup-
tions could be as severe as lasting several months, impacting
our fleet’s and off-shore equipment’s ability to safely continue
operations. The Group is monitoring the cyber threat closely
and proactively addresses it through enhancements of our
cyber resilience and focus on business continuity.

A potential widening of the container liner business supply-
demand imbalance is a perpetuated threat in an environment
with increasing tonnage and moderate global demand growth.
Astructural gap and overcapacity, coupled with the significant
exposure Maersk Line has on the Asia-Europe trade where the
larger vessels are increasingly deployed, leaves the Group vul-
nerable to significant fluctuations in freight rates and the risk of
sustaining commercial losses. The risk is mitigated by design-
ing a competitive network, building up customer loyalty, sim-
plifying the organisation and optimising the network through
alliances and vessel sharing agreements, such as the 2M.

EMERGING RISKS

Emerging risks are potential future risks, looking over a time
horison beyond that of the planning period. It is a strong un-
derlying modus operandi, that the Group pursues a sustainable
long term business and growth strategy. This means we need
to proactively consider future uncertainties that may affect
and potentially put such an aspiration at risk, which is done
through a comprehensive process aimed at identifying emerg-
ing long term threats. Some of the emerging risks identified,
were addressed through deep dive studies which were com-
pleted through 2013 and 2014.

An oil study examined the potential of global oil demand to
peak between 2020 and 2030 as consumers may switch away
from oil towards other sources of energy. In such an event, oil
prices would buoy within a delimited oil price corridor, with

4 18/110 >


--- Page 17 ---

AP Moller - Maersk Group
— Annual Report 2014

costs of new incremental sources of oil supply constituting a
price floor, while accelerated shifts away from oil as an energy
source, and hence easing demand, would serve as a ceiling.
Such an outcome may leave the profit pool for the global oil
industry challenged due to lower profit margins and volumes.
Similarly it would pose a downside risk to the demand for off-
shore drilling rigs and other related oil service industries.

A separate deep dive investigated plausible ways of meeting
a global sulphur emission cap of maximum 0.5%, which is
expected to be introduced in the shipping industry in 2020 or
2025. The study found several possible compliance options to
be considered. Given the uncertainty surrounding the timing
of implementation, choosing the right future fuel solution at

the right time is not straight forward, but it has the potential of
providing relative competitive advantages, conversely acting
prematurely may result in unnecessary costs. Ensuring proper
enforcement post potential implementation was identified as
akey uncertainty and will remain a focus, while we prepare to
take a well-informed compliance decision.

An industry analysis had the objective of depicting potential
scenarios for future developments in the Exploration & Pro-
duction (E&P) landscape faced by Maersk Oil and its peers. The
analysis revolved around the challenges and opportunities
among groups of E&P companies in the different scenarios, and
included an assessment of various strategies and the potential
implications of such for Maersk Oil and its selected long term.
portfolio growth strategy.

Overall the emerging risks studies aim at increasing our un-
derstanding of the uncertainty elements facing us in the future
and enable us in improving the Groups readiness for same.

Looking at trends ahead, one risk has emerged and strength-
ened, namely the ongoing significant increase in vessel size, so-
lidified by the arrival of the Triple-E vessels. On this backdrop,
the topic for a 2014/2015 deep dive study is the potential impact
and general risk picture surrounding Large Vessel Disasters.

PORTFOLIO RISKS

Being a global conglomerate, while spanning across multiple
geographies and industries, the Group also considers risks
associated with its composition of businesses and countries of
operation. This means that when managing our portfolio, both
dimensions need to be assessed and considered, ie. the balance
in our industry exposure and our geographic presence.

Looking at the correlation between the main businesses, see
the graph “Impact of diversification”, suggests that managing
them as a portfolio in a conglomerate as opposed to four stand-
alone businesses, reduces the associated risks. It also implies

a well-diversified portfolio of businesses able to absorb shocks
inflicting volatility within single businesses.

This is also evidenced when considering the Group's combined
NOPAT volatility, which is 33% lower than the volatility of each
of the individual businesses. From a geographic risk point of
view, the portfolio on average remains in the moderate category.

The Group's approved investments may modestly increase
the average exposure for each USD invested, but will remain
well-balanced by substantial investments in a number of low
risk countries, see the graph “Country risk and asset value".

OUR
EMPLOY EES

The Group’s Human Resources
department works in close cooperation
with the Human Resources departments in
the business units to ensure that the Group
has an engaged, motivated workforce and a
clear link between performance and rewards
as wellas to secure a sufficient number of
highly qualified, well-trained and diverse
employees to manage the planned growth.

= Contents

In 2014, we have seen continued progress and actions towards
our diversity goals. More information on diversity can be ob-
tained from the Group's Sustainability Report.

The businesses units each have their key priorities and focus
areas to support their respective strategies; below are exam-
ples from the Group's business units.

For Maersk Line, teamwork, focus and simplicity are consist-
ently emphasised as behaviours that are critical driving per-
formance and making Maersk Line a sustainable top quartile
performer. The Maersk Line Operating system was introduced
in 2014 to drive business goals through a standard operating
model. This system will help to drive focus, teamwork and sim-
plicity whilst allowing our employees to maximise their poten-
tial and grow the business.

The talent review process has also been simplified and stand-
ardised across Maersk Line in 2014. A standard Talent Manage-
ment toolbox is now available across the company to ensure
that employees are able to develop to their full potential Anew
leadership development programme will be introduced that will
help develop and drive value creation from talent whilst keep-
ing employees motivated and inspired by world class leaders.

Maersk Oil benefits from its good demographic profile com-
pared to industry peers. The early career employee group was
strengthened by the annual inflow from the successful MITAS
programme (Maersk International Technology and Science
Programme), with a 2014 batch of 19 nationalities and 36% fe-
males. The share of mid-career professionals and overall group
of technical experts is high compared with the industry, and
provide Maersk Oil with a strong base to address the opera-
tional performance and project execution focus in 2014.

The focus on local workforce development, strategically im-
portant in countries like Qatar, Kazakhstan and Angola, has

started to pay off with local nationals emerging in the Maersk
Oil talent pools and a doubling of Oataris in leadership positions
within a year.

APM Terminals unfortunately suffered 10 fatal accidents in
2014. These fatalities primarily involved sub-contractors on the
APM Terminals' premises. APM Terminals continuously drives
towards safe operations across the business in a pursuit to
eliminate unsafe behaviour.

During 2014 APM Terminals introduced several new initiatives
and safety drives to further improve conditions across the port-
folio. These include the campaign “Care for Contractors” increas-
ing awareness and focus towards the safety of sub-contractors
working on terminals and inland service sites and Project Stack,
an initiative to improve safer container handling at the cost of
productivity.

Since 2011 Maersk Drilling has invested USD 5.3bn in eight new
rigs with delivery in 2014-16 requiring a total of 1450 new em-
ployees of which around 550 were hired during 2014. Maersk
Drilling has the aim to remain at the forefront of innovation to
ensure safe operation for people and environment, and to ensure
asafe and efficient operation of the new rigs all new employees
have been enrolled in on-boarding and training programmes.

INNOVATION

The Group invests to ensure cutting-
edge technology solutions across its
businesses. Innovation is focused on:

¢ Delivering better services

¢ Protecting employees

¢ Minimising environmental impact

¢ Creating new business opportunities
e Ensuring cost-effectiveness.

Technological innovation is carried out by technology divisions
within the Group's business units, in close cooperation with

manufacturers, shipyards, suppliers, universities and research
institutes. Here are examples from the Group's business units.

= Contents

DIFFERENTIATE THROUGH

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION

Better use of technology and innovation is critical to maintain-
ing the Group's competitive edge in the digital age and this will
be an important driver for reducing cost as well as enhancing
our customer experience.

Maersk Line

Maersk Line has begun a journey to modernise its customer
interaction in line with the digital age, and the other business
units will also leverage from this.

The Group must take inspiration from leading global players
to reassess how we drive innovation in our own business.

Maersk Line actively works to achieve a combination of emis-
sions reduction and cost savings through innovation to mutual
benefit of the environment and the business. We do this in
close collaboration with key suppliers and third parties. For
instance Maersk Line is a key partner in the ‘BlueINNOship’
innovation platform with the goal to jointly develop technolo-
gies to improve environmental performance over the coming
four years.

Maersk Line tests and evaluates technologies to prepare for
upcoming regulations such as abatement technologies to
reduce air emissions including the upcoming limits in sulfur
emissions.

Maersk Line continues the retrofit programmes to update the
existing fleet with the most energy and cost efficient technolo-
gies, examples include:
¢ Redesign propeller to improve efficiency at the actual
sailing speeds
¢ Improve fuel efficiency by de-rating and tune the engine
for actual sailing speeds
¢ Elevate the navigation bridge to increase capacity.

In addition, Maersk Line collects an increased level of opera-
tional Vessel data to improve performance and support plan-
ning of most fuel efficient voyages.

Maersk Line uses Information Technology in most of its inno-
vation projects and strives to increase the pace in which we
evaluate and employ current and future technology trends.

An objective for Maersk Line is to improve the way information
is exchanged and processed in container shipping. Maersk Line
is working closely with universities, governments, business
partners to identify technology and concepts that can help re-
duce administrative barriers by standardising the exchange of
shipping information between all parties: Customers, authori-
ties, terminals/ports and carriers.

Information Technology plays a key role in the way Maersk
Line interacts with customers. From CRM and to web-based.
e-commerce and sales support solutions. In the end of 2014,
we launched a smartphone/tablet app, which gives our key
customers full access to updated information and metrics
about the customers’ transport activities with Maersk Line;
from carbon footprint to whether shipments were delivered
on time. The app is unique in the industry and the high level
of transparency enables a fact-based dialogue and faster reso-
lution of issues.

Maersk Oil

Maersk Oil is seeking to establish a business advantage by
being good at extracting hydrocarbons from challenging
reservoirs such as tight chalk reservoirs in the North Sea.
The company strives constantly to push the technology to
new boundaries and has held several records in the field
of horisontal drilling. Innovation is an important priority
inside the company as well as when interacting with part-
ners. A good example is the Danish Hydrocarbon Research &
Technology Centre, which was launched in September 2014

AP Moller - Maersk Group
— Annual Report 2014

based on funding of DKK 1bn from the Danish Underground
Consortium where Maersk Oil holds 31.2% interest. Close to
100 researchers will be focusing on development of technical
solutions which can increase the recovery of oil and gas from
the Danish North Sea. In Qatar, new technology development
also is in focus at the Maersk Oil Research and Technology
Centre where 15 researchers investigate new methods for in-
creasing hydrocarbon recovery from the complex carbonate
reservoirs of the Maersk Oil operated, giant Al Shaheen field.
One key research programme investigates how the reservoir
injection of water with varying chemical and ionic composi-
tions can liberate a larger volume of the oil adhering to the
tight and irregular rock surfaces.

Maersk Oil is pursuing a strategy of protecting own developed
technology by filing patent applications for new inventions.

28 new inventions were made in 2014 and are currently be-

ing evaluated in a number of countries. 8 new patents were

granted in 2014. The Company currently holds 93 patents.

APM Terminals

APM Terminals has completed the construction of Maasvlakte
Ilin Rotterdam, The Netherlands and has commenced opera-
tions with an expected volume ramp up to occur during 2015.
With this, Maasvlakte II has become the world’s most techno-
logically advanced automated terminal. Many of the systems
and technologies being implemented in this terminal will also
be utilised at APM Terminals’ new project at Lazaro Cardenas,
Mexico. The terminal is expected open in mid-2015, and will
be the first automated container terminal in Latin America.
Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico will feature fully automated electric
yard stacking cranes and shuttle carriers will be used for trans-
port between the yard cranes and ship to shore cranes. APM
Terminals continues to seek out new opportunities in growth
markets where value can be added through the implementa-
tion of automated terminals that provide safe and sustainable
terminal services to clients.

Maersk Drilling

BP and Maersk Drilling announced in February 2013 a joint
study agreement to develop conceptual engineering designs
for anew breed of advanced technology drilling rigs that will
be critical to unlocking the next frontier of deepwater oil and
gas resources. Called 20K™ rigs, the BP-Maersk Drilling agree-
ment will result in developing deepwater drilling rigs that can
safely and efficiently operate in high-pressure and high-tem-
perature reservoirs up to 20,000 pounds per square inch and
