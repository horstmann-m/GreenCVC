GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT
THIS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

In the following, we present a discussion and analysis of the
Group Management Report of Fresenius Medical Care AG &
CO. KGAA and its subsidiaries (together referred to as we, our,
FMC AG & CO. KGAA, Fresenius Medical Care, the Group or the
Company) prepared in accordance with sections 315 and
315e of the German Commercial Code and German Account-
ing Standards No. 17 and 20, as well as the consolidated
financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere
in this report. Some of the statements, including those con-
cerning future revenue, costs and capital expenditures, possi-
ble changes in our industry as well as the competitive and
financial conditions include forward-looking statements. We
made these forward-looking statements based on the
expectations and beliefs of the Management Board of the
Company’s General Partner (Management Board) pertaining
to future events that may affect us, but which we cannot
assure that such events will occur or that the results will be as
anticipated. Because these statements involve opportunities,
risks and uncertainties, the actual results may differ materially
(positive as well as negative) from the results which the for-
ward-looking statements express or imply. The statements
cover the content of and are subject to the uncertainties
described in the discussions in this report in chapters “Out-
look” starting on PAGE 60 and “Risks and Opportunities
Report” starting on PAGE 63 as well as in NOTE 2 AND 22 of the
notes to the consolidated financial statements.

The Non-Financial Report is not part of the Group Manage-
ment Report. It is part of a separate chapter of the Annual
Report and will be disclosed together with the Group Man-
agement Report. The Non-Financial Group Report can be
found starting on PAGE 81.

Due to rounding, individual numbers and percentages pre-
sented in this report may not precisely reflect the absolute
figures.

Our business is also subject to other opportunities, risks and
uncertainties that we describe in our public filings. Develop-
ments in any of these areas could cause our results to differ
materially to those that we or others have projected or may
project.

OVERVIEW OF
THE GROUP

We provide high-quality health care solutions
Sor patients with chronic kidney failure. Our
innovative products and therapi sel high
standards in dial ysts treatment.

BUSINESS MODEL
OPERATIONS AND COMPANY STRUCTURE

Fresenius Medical Care is the world’s leading dialysis com-
pany based on publicly reported revenue and the number of
patients treated. We provide dialysis care and related services
to people with chronic kidney failure, as well as other health
care services. The health care services that we offer in addi-
tion to dialysis are described by the term “Care Coordina-
tion”. Together with dialysis services, these constitute our
health care services. We also develop and manufacture a full
range of dialysis machines, systems and disposable products,
which we sell to customers in around 150 countries as well as
using them in our own health care service operations. Our
dialysis business is therefore vertically integrated.

To further strengthen this vertically integrated dialysis busi-
ness and enhance clinical outcomes and patient empower-
ment, we acquired NxStage Medical, Inc. (NxStage) in 2019.
NxStage develops, produces and markets an innovative pro-
duct portfolio of medical devices for use in home dialysis and
in the critical care setting. For further information on the
acquisition of NxStage, please refer to Note 3 in the notes to
the consolidated financial statements.

We continue to generate most of our revenue with dialysis
products and dialysis care services. In our 3,994 own dialysis
clinics in around 50 countries worldwide, we provide care for
over 345,000 dialysis patients. We are continuously expand-
ing this network of clinics, which is the largest in the world
based on the number of patients treated, to accommodate
the ever-rising number of dialysis patients. At the same time,
we operate 45 production sites in more than 20 countries.
The most important plants for dialyzer production are in St.
Wendel (Germany), Ogden (u.s.), Changshu (China),
L’Arbresle (France), and Buzen (Japan). Dialysis machines are
manufactured in Schweinfurt (Germany) and in Concord

(U.S.).

Fresenius Medical Care has a decentralized structure and is
divided into the regions North America, Europe, Middle East
and Africa (ema), Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Our operat-
ing segments correspond to this regional breakdown (the
term “North America Segment” refers to our North America
operating segment, the term “emeA Segment” refers to the
Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segment, the term
“Asia-Pacific Segment” refers to our Asia-Pacific operating
segment, and the term “Latin America Segment” refers to
our Latin America operating segment).

Fresenius Medical Care’s company headquarters is in Bad
Homburg v. d. Hohe, Germany. The headquarters in North
America, our most important region in terms of revenue, is in
Waltham, Massachusetts (u.s.).

CHART 2.2 ON PAGE 21 provides an overview of our most
important production sites and headquarters.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Fresenius Medical Care provides mainly dialysis products and
services. We also offer non-dialysis services as part of Care
Coordination as well as non-dialysis products. Our products
and services for the fiscal year 2019 are shown in CHART 2.1
ON PAGE 20.

Approximately 3.5 M patients worldwide regularly under-
went dialysis treatment at the end of 2019. Dialysis is a
life-saving blood cleansing procedure that substitutes the
function of the kidney in case of kidney failure. Healthy
kidneys clean the blood of waste products, regulate water
levels, and produce important hormones. If the kidneys are
irreparably damaged and are therefore no longer able to
function adequately over a longer period of time, this is
known as chronic kidney failure or end-stage renal disease
(esrb). Many diseases can lead to chronic kidney failure,
particularly diabetes, chronic nephritis or high blood pressure.
There are currently two treatment options for esrb: a kidney
transplant and dialysis.

Our health care products

We develop, manufacture and distribute a wide variety of
health care products, including both dialysis and non-dialysis
products.

The dialysis products we offer in around 150 countries around
the world focus on the following therapies:

>» Hemodialysis (HD) — HD is by far the most common type of
therapy for chronic kidney failure. Fresenius Medical Care
provides a wide range of HD products in dialysis centers as
well as for use at home. They include machines, dialyzers,
bloodline systems, HD solutions and concentrates, water

» Peritoneal dialysis (p>) — In pp the peritoneum is used as a
natural filter. We offer systems and solutions for continuous
ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (cap) and automated perito-
neal dialysis (APD) in dialysis centers as well as for use at
home.

» Acute dialysis — In case of a sudden loss of renal function,
continuous renal replacement therapy is used in intensive
care units. Fresenius Medical Care also provides products for
this.

We also offer non-dialysis products including acute cardiopul-
monary products and products for apheresis therapy, which
involves the removal of excess blood fats or pathogenic anti-
bodies.

Our health care services
Dialysis services

Dialysis patients receive life-saving dialysis treatment and
other associated services such as laboratory tests in our 3,994
(2018: 3,928) dialysis clinics worldwide. Dialysis treatment at
our clinics is usually performed three times a week over a
period of several hours by trained medical staff. We also pro-
vide advice on medical support and training for home dialysis
patients in our dialysis centers.

In 2019, we treated most of our patients (61 %) in the North
America Segment, followed by 19 % in the emeA Segment,
10 % in the Latin America Segment and 10 % in the Asia-
Pacific Segment.

Fresenius Medical Care is able to operate its own dialysis clin-
ics in countries where the health care system allows pri-

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

vate-sector companies to provide medical services and an
appropriate reimbursement system is in place.

Care Coordination

Care Coordination allows us to further enhance our business
beyond dialysis, for example in markets where the privatized
dialysis market is relatively well developed and we already
have a high market share. Although our Care Coordination
business is geared to different geographical markets, we cur-
rently provide non-dialysis services mainly in North America
and Asia-Pacific. In recent years, the health care system in the
u.s. has started to move away from reimbursement of individ-
ual services toward holistic and coordinated care. Our Care
Coordination activities and our experience in dialysis mean
that we can participate in the development of the u.s. health
care system. At the same time, patients can benefit from
coordinated care, and health care systems from lower costs.

MAJOR MARKETS AND
COMPETITIVE POSITION

According to our estimates, the number of dialysis patients
worldwide reached around 3.5 M in 2019 (2018: 3.4 M)-a
6 % growth rate. In the same period, 345,096 patients were
treated in Fresenius Medical Care’s network of dialysis centers
(2018: 333,331). This means that Fresenius Medical Care
holds the leading position worldwide in dialysis care. More
information on the number of patients can be found in
CHART 2.3 ON PAGE 22.

Fresenius Medical Care is also the global market leader for
dialysis products. Products made by Fresenius Medical Care
for use in our own dialysis centers or for sale to third-party
customers accounted for a market share of 36 % in 2019
(2018: 35 %). In the case of hemodialysis products, we had a

41 % share of the global market (2018: 39 %), making us
the world leader in this field as well.

Dialyzers for hemodialysis are the largest product group in
the dialysis market with a worldwide sales volume of over
350M units in 2019. More than 155M (around 44 %)
of these were made by Fresenius Medical Care, giving us by
far the biggest market share. Hemodialysis machines consti-
tute another key component of our product business. Here,
too, we are the clear market leader. Of the estimated
102,000 machines installed in 2019, around 52,000, or more
than 50 % (2018: more than 50%), were produced by
Fresenius Medical Care.

Furthermore, we hold a strong position in the market for
peritoneal dialysis products: Around 16 % (2018: around
17 %) of all peritoneal dialysis patients use products made by
Fresenius Medical Care.

Fresenius Medical Care is also the global leader in dialysis
care, providing treatment to about 10 % of all dialysis
patients. The market for dialysis care services in the u.s. is
already highly consolidated. Fresenius Medical Care treats
around 38 % of all dialysis patients here.

Outside the u.s., the dialysis services business is much more
fragmented. With around 1,430 dialysis centers and approxi-
mately 137,000 patients in around 50 countries, Fresenius
Medical Care operates by far the largest network of clinics.

MANUFACTURING, QUALITY AND SUPPLY

The Global Manufacturing, Quality and Supply (amas) divi-
sion centrally manages all of Fresenius Medical Care's global
activities relating to the procurement of raw materials and
semi-finished goods as well as the manufacturing and distri-
bution of renal products. In April 2019, Supply Chain Man-
agement was globalized in all regions under the responsibility
of Global Manufacturing and Quality (GmaQ). To reflect this

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

integration in a single, unified organization, GMa has been
renamed Gmas.

cmas strives to ensure reliable product quality and effective
product supply at optimized total cost with efficient utiliza-
tion of capital.

The objective of our production strategy is to manufacture
high-quality products in the right place at the right time on
the best possible terms. We are able to successfully implement
this strategy thanks to a network of large production sites,
where we make products for sale worldwide, as well as smaller
production sites that primarily supply products regionally.

Strategic purchasing at Fresenius Medical Care is geared
toward ensuring the availability, safety and quality of the
materials used in production with the aim of further expand-
ing our competitive and internationally balanced supplier
network.

At the end of 2019, cmas had 16,418 employees (full-time
equivalents) (2018: 16,172). In total, we operate 45 produc-
tion sites in more than 20 countries.

CORPORATE STRATEGY
AND OBJECTIVES

Creating a future worth living. For patients. Worldwide. Every
day. This purpose guides us in our efforts to give our patients
around the world a better life by offering them high-quality
products and outstanding health care. It is based on our cor-
porate values: collaborative, proactive, reliable, excellent.

STRATEGIC CORE COMPETENCIES

Fresenius Medical Care aims to further consolidate its exper-
tise as the world’s leading provider of top-quality dialysis
treatments and health care products and to apply them as a
basis for sustainable, profitable growth. Moreover, in the area
of Care Coordination, our goal is to provide holistic care and
improve outcomes for patients as well as payors while increas-
ing Fresenius Medical Care's corporate value in the long term.
Our strategy is based on four core competencies (SEE CHART 2.4).

> Innovating products

Developing innovative products to achieve even better
outcomes for our patients is an inherent part of our strategy
of sustainable and profitable growth. We leverage our
technology leadership position in dialysis to enhance treat-
ment options in such a way that both patients and health
care systems can benefit. This is also why we are committed
to further expanding home dialysis. In addition, we are
constantly striving to identify new business opportunities in
value-added technologies and approaches, for example
through our venture capital company Fresenius Medical
Care Ventures.

Operating outpatient facilities

By leveraging our experience gained in currently 3,994 pro-
prietary dialysis clinics in around 50 countries, we have the
knowledge to operate and manage stand-alone outpatient
clinics efficiently and capture economies of scale. We are
continuously optimizing and modernizing our processes
and administrative structures.

23

» Standardizing medical procedures

Our goal is to standardize medical treatments and clinical
processes while continuing to ensure high-quality clinical
outcomes. In 2019, we established the Global Medical
Office with the aim of enhancing knowledge transfer across
the Company. By adding the Global Chief Medical Officer
to the Management Board as of January 1, 2020, Fresenius
Medical Care is underlining the importance of interlinking
clinical science with therapy. With over 52M _ dialysis
treatments performed per year, we have one of the largest
dialysis databases worldwide. We intend to use this
information to standardize medical setups, open new clinics
and integrate acquired clinics into our network based on
proven and efficient concepts.

Coordinating patients efficiently

In an environment of growing patient numbers and changing
health care systems, Fresenius Medical Care sees significant
potential in providing value-based care — especially in the
u.s. This approach focuses on selling solutions, providing

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

holistic care and receiving outcome-based reimbursement
rather than offering single products or services.

Depending on the type of health care network in which we
participate, we coordinate the care of our patients with other
providers including physicians and other health care facilities.
We then use the accumulated patient information to create
predictive analytics.

GLOBAL EFFICIENCY PROGRAM

In 2017 we announced the second phase of our Global Effi-
ciency Program (cer Il). The program's objectives are to iden-
tify and realize further efficiency potential and enhance the
Company‘s overall competitiveness. The expected range of
sustained cost improvements is €150M to €200M per
annum by the end of 2020.

For further information on our goals, see the “Outlook”
chapter starting on PAGE 60.

PERFORMANCE
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The Management Board oversees our Company by setting
strategic and operational targets and measuring various
financial key performance indicators used for internal man-
agement determined in euro based upon IFrs.

The key performance indicators used for internal manage-
ment are the same in all the individual operating segments.

Each operating segment is evaluated based on target figures
that reflect the revenue and expenses they control. The
effects of certain transactions and income taxes are not
included as we believe these items to be outside the operat-
ing segments’ control. Financing is a corporate function,
which the operating segments do not control. Therefore, we
do not include interest expense relating to financing as an
operating segment measurement. Similarly, we do not allo-
cate certain costs which relate primarily to certain headquar-
ters’ overhead charges, including accounting and finance,
global research and development, etc. because we believe
that these costs are also not within the control of the individ-
ual operating segments.

Certain of the following key performance indicators and
other financial information as well as discussions and analy-
ses set out in this report include measures that are not defined
by irrs (Non-iFRs Measure). We believe this information,
along with comparable !rrs measurements, is useful to our
investors as it provides a basis for assessing our performance,
payment obligations related to performance-based compen-
sation as well as our compliance with financial covenants.
Non-irrs financial measures should not be viewed or inter-
preted as a substitute for financial information presented in
accordance with IFrs.

24

Some key performance indicators and other financial mea-
sures used in this report such as changes in revenue, operat-
ing income and net income attributable to shareholders of
FMC AG & CO. KGAA include the impact of translating local cur-
rencies to our reporting currency for financial reporting pur-
poses. We calculate these Non-irrs financial measures at con-
stant exchange rates in our filings to show changes in our
revenue, operating income, net income attributable to share-
holders of FMc AG & CO. KGAA and other items without giving
effect to period-to-period currency fluctuations. Under iFrs,
amounts received in local (non-euro) currency are translated
into euro at the average exchange rate for the period pre-
sented. Once we translate the local currency for the constant
currency, we then calculate the change, as a percentage, of
the current period calculated using the prior period exchange
rates versus the prior period. This resulting percentage is a
Non-irrs Measure referring to a change as a percentage at
constant currency. These currency-adjusted financial mea-
sures are identifiable by the designated terms “Constant
Exchange Rates” or “Constant Currency.”

We believe that the measures at Constant Currency are use-
ful to investors, lenders and other creditors because such
information enables them to gauge the impact of currency
fluctuations on our revenue, operating income, net income
attributable to shareholders of Fc AG & CO. KGAA and other
items from period to period. In addition, under our long-term
incentive plans, we measure the attainment of certain pre-de-
termined financial targets for revenue growth and net income
growth in Constant Currency. However, we limit our use of
Constant Currency period-over-period changes to a measure
for the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of
local currency into euro. We do not evaluate our results and
performance without considering both:

1. period-over-period changes in revenue, operating income,
net income attributable to shareholders of FMc AG & CO.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

kGAA and other items prepared in accordance with IFRs
and

2. Constant Currency changes in revenue, operating income,
net income attributable to shareholders of Fmc AG & CO
KGAA and other items.

We caution the readers of this report to follow a similar
approach by considering data on Constant Currency peri-
od-over-period changes only in addition to, and not as a sub-
stitute for or superior to, changes in revenue, operating
income, net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG &
co. KGAA and other items prepared in accordance with IFRs.
We present the growth rate derived from non-iFRs measures
next to the growth rate derived from iFRs measures such as
revenue, operating income, net income attributable to share-
holders of FMc AG & CO. KGAA and other items. As the recon-
ciliation is inherent in the disclosure, we believe that a sepa-
rate reconciliation would not provide any additional benefit.

REVENUE

The management of our operating segments is based on rev-
enue as a key performance indicator. We believe that the key
to continue growing our revenue is to attract new patients
and increase the number of treatments performed each year.
The number of treatments performed each year is therefore
an indicator of continued revenue growth. For further infor-
mation regarding revenue recognition and measurement,
refer to NoTE 1 K of the notes to consolidated financial state-
ments. Revenue is also benchmarked based on movement at
Constant Exchange Rates.

OPERATING INCOME

Operating income is the most appropriate measure for evalu-
ating the profitability of the operating segments and there-


--- Page 8 ---

fore is also a key performance indicator. Operating income is
also benchmarked based on movement at Constant Exchange
Rates.

OPERATING INCOME MARGIN

Operating income margin represents the ratio of operating
income to revenue. We believe operating income margin
shows the profitability of each of our operating segments or
our consolidated company.

DELIVERED OPERATING INCOME
(NON-IFRS MEASURE)

As a result of the significance of noncontrolling interest hold-
ers in our operations, we believe a measure that is meaning-
ful to investors is operating income less noncontrolling inter-
ests (Delivered Operating Income). Delivered Operating
Income approximates the operating income attributable to
the shareholders of FMC AG & CO. KGAA. As such, we believe
that operating income is the closest comparable irrs mea-
sure. Delivered Operating Income is also benchmarked based
on movement at Constant Exchange Rates.

TABLE 2.5 shows the reconciliation of operating income to
Delivered Operating Income on a consolidated basis and for
our reporting segments.

NET INCOME GROWTH AT CONSTANT
CURRENCY (NON-IFRS MEASURE)

On a consolidated level, percentage growth in net income
(net income attributable to shareholders of FMc AG & CO.
kGAA) at Constant Currency is an additional key performance
indicator used for internal management.

BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH AT
CONSTANT CURRENCY (NON-IFRS MEASURE)

Percentage growth in basic earnings per share at Constant
Currency is a key performance indicator to evaluate our prof-
itability. This indicator helps to manage our overall perfor-
mance. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net

income attributable to shareholders by the weighted-average
number of outstanding shares over the course of the year.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

We manage our investments using a detailed coordination
and evaluation process. The Management Board sets our
complete investment budget as well as the investment tar-

gets. Before realizing specific investment projects or acquisi-
tions, our internal Acquisition & Investment Committee
examines the individual projects and measures considering
the expected return on investment and potential yield. Invest-
ment projects are evaluated using common methods such as
net present value, internal interest rate methods and payback
periods. We utilize this evaluation methodology to ensure
that we only make and implement investments and acquisi-
tions that increase shareholder value. Capital expenditures
for property, plant and equipment is an indicator used for
internal management. It influences the capital invested for
replacement and expansion.

CASH FLOW MEASURES

Net cash provided by (used in)
operating activities in % of revenue

Our consolidated statement of cash flows indicates how we
generated and used cash and cash equivalents. In conjunc-
tion with our other primary financial statements, it provides
information that helps us evaluate changes to our net assets
and our financial structure (including liquidity and solvency).
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities is applied
to assess whether a business can generate the cash required
to make the necessary replacement and expansion of invest-
ments. This indicator is impacted by the profitability of our
business and the development of working capital, mainly
receivables. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities
in percent of revenue shows the percentage of our revenue
that is available in terms of financial resources. It is an indica-
tor of our operating financial strength.

26

Free cash flow in % of revenue
(Non-IFRS Measure)

Free cash flow (net cash provided by (used in) operating activ-
ities after capital expenditures, before acquisitions and invest-
ments) refers to the cash flow we have at our disposal, includ-
ing cash flows that may be restricted for other uses. This
indicator shows the percentage of revenue available for
acquisitions and investments, dividends to shareholders,
reducing debt financing or for repurchasing shares.

TABLE 2.6 shows the cash flow key performance indicators for
2019 and 2018 and reconciles free cash flow and free cash
flow in percent of revenue to Net cash provided by (used in)
operating activities and Net cash provided by (used in) oper-

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

NET LEVERAGE RATIO (NON-IFRS MEASURE)

The net leverage ratio is a key performance indicator used for
internal management. To determine the net leverage ratio,
debt and lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents (net
debt) is compared to adjusted esitpa (earnings before inter-
est, taxes, depreciation and amortization) (adjusted for acqui-
sitions and divestitures made during the year with a purchase
price above a €50 M threshold as defined in the Amended
2012 Credit Agreement, non-cash charges and impairment
loss). The ratio is an indicator of the length of time the Com-
pany needs to service the net debt out of its own resources.
We believe that the net leverage ratio provides alternative
information that management believes to be useful in assess-
ing our ability to meet our payment obligations in addition to
considering the absolute amount of our debt. We have a
strong market position in a growing, global and mainly
non-cyclical market. Furthermore, most of our customers
have a high credit rating as the dialysis industry is character-
ized by stable and sustained cash flows. We believe this
enables us to work with a reasonable proportion of debt,
through the employment of an extensive mix of debt.

IFRS 16, Leases (iFRs 16) replaces the straight-line operating
lease expense for former leases under IAs 17, Leases (IAs 17)
with a depreciation charge for the lease asset and an interest
expense on the lease liability as well as the classification of
certain 1as 17 leases (such effects being, collectively “irrs 16
Implementation”), sEE NOTE 1 of the notes to the consoli-
dated financial statements. The adjustment to exclude the
effects from the iFrs 16 Implementation is included solely for
the purpose of increasing the comparability of previously
reported information and is in conformity with the terms of
the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement. This adjustment will
only be made for the reporting periods included in this report
and will not be included as an adjustment in the future.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

General information Outlook

Overview of the Group Risks and Opportunities Report

Economic Report Corporate Governance fundamentals

Subsequent events

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Developing innovative products and continuously improving
our dialysis treatments are intrinsic elements of our growth
strategy. Our worldwide research and development activities,
which are centrally managed by the Global Research and
Development division (GRD), enable us to develop products
efficiently and systematically promote the exchange of know-
ledge and technology between regions.

GLOBAL RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

Health care systems face major financial challenges now and
in the long term. This confirms our intention to gear our
research and development activities toward developing inno-
vative products that not only meet high quality standards, but
are also affordable. As an operator of proprietary dialysis clin-
ics and a provider of products for treating patients at home,
we know that these are by no means incompatible aims.

Our research and development strategy is globally oriented,
enabling us to respond even better to the worldwide rise in
demand for high-quality yet cost-efficient treatment meth-
ods. In doing so, we also take regional market conditions into
account and offer a differentiated product range.

In the future, we intend to deliver innovative, competitive
products even more efficiently and strengthen our focus on
developing countries. In addition to research and develop-
ment activities within our Company, we collaborate with
external partners with the aim of building a comprehensive
innovation and technology network. These partners include
numerous academic institutions, such as research institutes at
prestigious universities in the u.s. Another partner is the
Renal Research Institute (RRI) in New York. This subsidiary of
Fresenius Medical Care North America is a renowned institu-

32

tion in the field of clinical research into all aspects of chronic
kidney failure. Together, we are working on fundamental
issues relating to dialysis treatment. We are also increasingly
collaborating with start-ups with the objective of promoting
an open culture of innovation and enabling access to the lat-
est technologies.

INNOVATIONS IN 2019

To be able to continuously improve our patients’ quality of life
and the outcomes of their treatment and to ensure our
growth in the medium to long term, we not only work on
new products that are close to market launch, but also have
an extensive portfolio of innovation projects. These focus on
technologies in our core business as well as related areas of
strategic interest.

New hemodialysis system in development

In 2019, the u.s. Food and Drug Administration (FpA) granted
breakthrough device designation to a new hemodialysis sys-
tem, currently in development, that aims to prevent blood
clotting without the use of blood thinner medication. The
novel system integrates the antithrombogenic additive
Endexo into the manufacturing process of dialyzers and
bloodlines. Endexo is a polymer made of surface modifying
molecules that are designed to inhibit the adsorption of pro-
tein and platelets. When incorporated into the membrane,
this additive creates a modified inner wall that allows blood
to pass through more effectively. Citrasate dialysate would be
used with the new dialyzers and bloodlines as part of this
novel system. The hope is that the new system will help
reduce the risk of coagulation and increase hemocompatibil-
ity thereby eliminating the need for blood thinners, such as
heparin, in most standard dialysis treatments.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

Digital health care

Digitization, connectivity and data analysis are key elements
of our development strategy. In the future, our devices will be
connected to a modern connectivity framework that takes
full account of different user needs and therapy options. The
aim is to make the processes more efficient and thus achieve
ever better treatment outcomes. The data analysis of this
framework enables us to offer intelligent products and solu-
tions that illustrate the complexity of treatments and pro-
cesses internally.

Application tailored to emerging markets

The number of dialysis patients worldwide is expected to
increase. Emerging markets need cost-effective programs
that help to better manage the entire dialysis treatment pro-
cess. In response to this need, we are currently developing a
digital application tailored to the Asian markets. The app is a
cloud-based clinical information system that offers electronic
treatment management at a reasonable price, thus increasing
the efficiency of work processes in clinics. To test the digital
app in its environment, Fresenius Medical Care launched a
production pilot in a clinic in India in the third quarter of
2019. Market launch is planned mid/end of 2020.

Research in the field of regenerative medicine

We invest in promising technologies and research approaches
in the area of regenerative medicine through our indepen-
dent affiliate Unicyte ac as well as Fresenius Medical Care
Ventures. In fiscal year 2019, we invested €60 M in Unicyte.
Unicyte will primarily use this capital to start clinical trials and
establish the corresponding manufacturing processes. Our
continued investment in Unicyte shows our commitment to
developing the best treatment options for our patients across
the entire spectrum of renal therapy.

Subsequent events

Our venture capital company Fresenius Medical Care Ven-
tures is increasingly collaborating with start-ups with the aim
of promoting an open culture of innovation and gaining
access to the latest technologies. In 2019, Fresenius Medical
Care Ventures invested in eGenesis, a leading player in the
field of xenotransplantation of kidneys for patients with
advanced renal disease. Xenotransplantation could signifi-
cantly improve the lives of patients with kidney failure, reduce
overall costs and dramatically increase the number of kidneys
available for transplant.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES

In fiscal year 2019, Fresenius Medical Care spent a total of
around €168M on research and development (2018:
€114 M), corresponding to around 5 % (2018: 3 %) of our
health care product revenue. At the end of 2019, our patent
portfolio comprised some 10,658 property rights in approxi-
mately 1,518 patent families, i.e. groups of patents linked to
the same invention. Our research and development work in
fiscal year 2019 produced around 163 additional patent fam-
ilies. Our broad portfolio of patents will provide us with a
wide range of treatment options in this highly competitive
field in the future.

At December 31, 2019, 1,157 highly qualified employees
(full-time equivalents) worked for Fresenius Medical Care in
research and development worldwide (December 31,
2018: 933). They come from various backgrounds: Physicians
work side by side with software specialists, business econo-
mists and engineers in interdisciplinary teams. More than
680 employees — the majority of our research and develop-
ment staff — are based in Europe. Most research and develop-
ment activities are carried out at our facilities in Schweinfurt
and Bad Homburg v. d. Hohe (Germany). Other development
sites are located in St. Wendel (Germany), Bucharest (Roma-
nia) and Krems (Austria). In the u.s., the Company maintains

33

centers of excellence for the development of devices in Con-
cord (California) and for dialyzers and other disposable prod-
ucts in Ogden (Utah). Development activities in Shanghai and
Changshu (China) are focused on the growing demand for
cost-effective dialysis systems in Asia and emerging markets.
The Global Research and Development organization coordi-
nates collaboration and technology exchange among the var-
ious sites. Carrying out research and development responsibly
is an intrinsic element of our innovation culture. More infor-
mation is shown in TABLE 2.10 ON PAGE 34.

EMPLOYEES

Fresenius Medical Care owes its business success to the com-
mitment of its employees. At a functional level, our human
resources management is conducted globally to ensure a uni-
form strategic approach in line with the overriding corporate
objectives.

At December 31, 2019, Fresenius Medical Care employed a
total of 120,659 members of staff (full-time equivalents) in
64 countries worldwide. Our workforce therefore increased
by 7% year-on-year, or by 8,001 employees in absolute
terms. This was primarily the result of our acquisition efforts,
above all relating to the integration of NxStage.

TABLE 2.11 ON PAGE 34 shows the breakdown of employees by
operating segment as well as by products and services.

Staff costs at Fresenius Medical Care increased to €6,799 M
in 2019 (2018: €6,440 M), corresponding to 39 % (2018:
39 %) of revenue. Average staff costs per employee (annual
average based on full-time equivalents) amounted to €56,740
(2018: €57,129).

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

More information about our employees can be found in the
Non-Financial Group Report starting on PAGE 81. For more

QUALITY MANAGEMENT

At Fresenius Medical Care, we believe in offering high-quality
and reliable products and therapies to ensure the best possi-
ble medical care for our patients and customers. We operate
production facilities worldwide to meet the demand for our
dialysis products and other health care products.

QUALITY MANAGEMENT AT
OUR PRODUCTION SITES

Over the last several years, Gmas has introduced a stable
infrastructure with efficient processes and systems. All pro-
duction sites follow the “Lean Manufacturing” approach
which, in North America and our Schweinfurt plant, includes
the “Lean Six Sigma” management system. The focus of Lean
Manufacturing and Six Sigma is on the continuous improve-
ment of all manufacturing processes to achieve a low defect
rate resulting in improved product quality, while reducing
manufacturing times. We have successfully harmonized all
local Quality Management Systems (Qms) in all manufactur-
ing and development sites of our EMEA Segment, Latin Amer-
ica Segment and Asia-Pacific Segment under one Consoli-
dated ams (cams). Every medical device plant within these
segments has a local aus directed by cams that is certified
either to Iso 13485:2016 and/or Iso 9001:2015. The ams of
each site is reviewed through periodic management review,

QUALITY MANAGEMENT
IN OUR DIALYSIS CLINICS

Our clinics work in conformance with the generally accepted
quality standards of the industry, particularly the u.s. Kidney
Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (kDoQ!) guidelines, the
European Renal Best Practice standard (ERBP), and increasingly
the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (kpDiIGo), an
industry initiative for global clinical practice guidelines. Clini-
cal data management systems are used to routinely collect
certain medical parameters, which we evaluate in ano-
nymized form in compliance with these guidelines.

More information about our quality management including
our quality data can be found in the Non-Financial Group
Report starting on PAGE 81.

QUALITY-BASED REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEMS

We participate in quality-based reimbursement models,
which we describe in the section “Health care and reimburse-
ment systems vary from country to country” in the chapter
“Economic Report” starting on PAGE 37.

RESPONSIBILITY AND
SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT

Operating on a global scale means having global responsibil-
ity. Fresenius Medical Care is aware of this responsibility.

Over the past years, we have continuously stepped up our
sustainability activities. For us, sustainability means acting
responsibly to achieve business success as well as medical,
environmental and social progress. We have established a
global sustainability governance structure to further improve
the coordination and management of sustainability topics
across all regions and functions.

Acting in a responsible and sustainable manner is a funda-
mental component of our strategy; it secures our future as a
globally operating company in the health care industry.

ECONOMIC REPORT

The dialysis market is a sustainable growth market
with steadily rising demand for products and ser-
vices to treat patients with chronic kidney disease.

MACROECONOMIC AND
SECTOR-SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT

MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
Dependency on economic cycles

Our business is exposed to economic cycles only to a relatively
small extent. This sets us apart from manufacturers of con-
sumer goods, for instance, whose products are subject to
more cyclical demand.

Our business is impacted more by government reimburse-
ment rates and remuneration systems. Dialysis is a vital med-
ical service, which is why it is usually paid for by the responsi-
ble health care system.

Exchange rate developments

The global exchange rate developments in fiscal year 2019
were characterized by a relatively constant exchange rate
between the euro and the u.s. dollar, as well as partly stron-
ger fluctuations in the emerging economies. Some currencies
in emerging economies in particular depreciated significantly
against the euro and the u.s. dollar. As Fresenius Medical
Care has a worldwide presence, the results of its operations
are impacted by exchange rate developments. Movements in
the u.s. dollar and the euro are especially crucial as we gen-
erate a major part of our revenues in the u.s. On average over

36

the course of the year, the euro traded weaker against the
u.s. dollar than in fiscal year 2018.

In addition, Fresenius Medical Care’s operating results are
influenced by changes in the exchange rate between the euro
and local currencies. This is partly due to intra-Group sales
from large production sites in the euro zone to Group compa-
nies with different functional currencies, but also because the
euro is the currency we use for financial reporting. Regarding
intra-Group sales, individual subsidiaries are exposed to fluc-
tuations in the exchange rate between the invoicing curren-
cies and the currencies in which they conduct their local oper-
ations. Fresenius Medical Care reduces transaction risks, i.e.
risks from foreign currency exposures or exchange rate fluc-
tuations, through a global network of production facilities,
which is geared toward demand in the Company's dialysis
product business. As the production facilities are often based
in the markets they serve, costs are incurred in the same cur-
rency in which revenue is generated. The risk of exchange
rate fluctuations is relatively low for health care services
because they are provided locally and are therefore invoiced
in the respective currency.

SECTOR-SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT

Chronic kidney failure (end-stage renal disease, ESRD) is a
global disease. The number of patients requiring renal
replacement therapy is increasing worldwide: At the end of
2019, approximately 4.3 M patients underwent dialysis treat-
ment or received a donor organ.

Further information can be found in TABLE 2.12.

For many years now, the number of donated organs world-
wide has been significantly lower than the number of patients
on transplant waiting lists. Despite extensive efforts by
regional initiatives to increase awareness of kidney donation

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

and the willingness to donate, the share of patients receiving
kidney transplantation compared with other treatment meth-
ods has remained relatively unchanged over the past ten
years.

The prevalence of chronic kidney failure varies between
regions. There are several reasons for this:

>» The countries differ demographically, as age structures in
the population vary worldwide.

> The prevalence of risk factors for kidney disease, such as
diabetes and high blood pressure, varies widely.

>» The genetic predisposition for kidney disease also differs
significantly around the world.

» Access to dialysis remains restricted in many countries,
meaning that many patients suffering from chronic kidney
failure are not treated and therefore do not appear in prev-
alence statistics.

> Cultural factors, such as nutrition, play a role.

The number of dialysis patients rose by around 6 % in 2019.
The growth rate was lower in countries such as the u.s.,
Japan, and Western and Central Europe than in economically
weaker regions, where it is generally above 6 %.

Comparison of dialysis treatment methods

In 2019, most dialysis patients were treated in one of approx-
imately 45,600 dialysis centers worldwide, with an average of
more than 75 patients per center. However, this figure varies
considerably from country to country.

Hemodialysis is by far the most common form of therapy for
chronic kidney failure. A total of 88 % of dialysis patients
were treated in this way at a dialysis center in 2019. Home
hemodialysis is an alternative to treatment at a dialysis center.
Although take-up has been limited to date, the number of
home hemodialysis patients is rising continuously. A total of
1 % of all patients are currently treated in this way. In the
year under review, 11 % of all dialysis patients were treated
with peritoneal dialysis, usually at home. As a result, 12 % of
our dialysis patients were treated with home dialysis.

CHART 2.13 shows a comparison of in-center and home dialysis.
Volume of the dialysis market

According to our estimates, the volume of the global dialysis
market increased to around €80 BN in 2019 (2018: €74 BN).
The market grew by 4 % over the past year at Constant Cur-
rency. We expect the following approximate breakdown for
this market volume: around €14 BN for dialysis products and
approximately €66 BN for dialysis services (including dialysis
drugs).

Care Coordination

Chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular dis-
eases are becoming increasingly common and are responsible
for approximately two out of three deaths worldwide. In
many countries, a large proportion of health care spending

37

goes toward treating chronic diseases. To counteract the
resultant increase in cost pressure, more and more health
care systems, such as that in our largest market, the u.s., are
starting to promote coordinated, holistic care rather than
reimbursing individual services.

Due to the large number of different services offered in the
area of Care Coordination, we cannot provide a meaningful
estimate of the market volume. We currently offer medical
services in Care Coordination primarily in the North America
and Asia-Pacific Segments and have adapted our services in
this area to these markets. The extent to which we roll out
our Care Coordination services outside the u.s. may vary in

individual countries and regions depending on the respective
reimbursement system and market environment.

Our customers are mostly health insurers
and companies

Fresenius Medical Care's most important customers are state-
owned or public health insurers, private health insurers, and
companies.

Health care and reimbursement systems
vary from country to country

As renal replacement therapy is a life-saving medical service,
patients often do not have to pay for dialysis themselves.
Instead, the costs are borne by the responsible health care
system. The reimbursement systems for dialysis treatment — in
other words, the structures used by health care systems to
regulate reimbursement for dialysis services — differ from
country to country and sometimes even within countries. The
business activities of dialysis service providers and the reim-
bursement of dialysis therapy are affected by various factors
including regional conditions, the treatment method, regula-
tory issues, and the type of provider (public or private).

Our ability to influence the reimbursement of our services is
limited.

The reimbursement system in the U.S.

The environment for reimbursement and the conditions for
prescribing ancillary services significantly influence our busi-
ness. In the U.s., our biggest market, most of our patients are
insured by the governmental health authority, the so-called
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (cms). In fiscal year 2019,
around 33 % of our revenue was attributable to reimburse-

Subsequent events

ments by cms, which also determines the reimbursement
rates for its patients (Medicare / Medicaid patients).

Due to pressure to reduce health care costs, increases in the
reimbursement rate were limited in the u.s. in the past. As a
consequence, the reimbursement rate set by cms as part of its
prospective payment system (Pps) for chronic kidney failure
treatments (known as the esrb pps rate) barely changed year-
on-year. The esrb pps rate for 2019 amounted to $235.27, up
1.3 % on the 2018 base rate including an adjustment for the
wage index budget neutrality factor. A reimbursement rate of
$239.33 has been determined for 2020. This represents a
1.7 % increase on the 2019 base rate including an adjust-
ment for the wage index budget neutrality factor and a pro-
ductivity-adjusted market basket increase of 1.7 %.

Any significant reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates
could have a material adverse effect on our health care ser-
vices business. As demand for dialysis products is affected by
Medicare reimbursement rates, this could have consequences
for the development of our product business. To the extent
that inflation, for example in the form of higher costs for per-
sonnel and disposables, is not fully compensated by an
increase in reimbursement rates, our business and results of
operations may also be adversely affected.

More information can be found in the “Results of operations,
financial position and net assets” section starting on PAGE 42
and in the “Risks and Opportunities Report” starting on
PAGE 63.

In the u.s., reimbursement by private insurers and managed
care organizations is higher than reimbursement by govern-
ment institutions. At the same time, payments from private
insurers constitute a substantial portion of our profits, mean-
ing our business is directly influenced by changes in the share
of reimbursements by private insurers in North America. In

38

fiscal year 2019, 34 % of the Group's health care revenue
was related to private insurers in the North America Segment.

Transitional add-on payments for new drugs
and devices in the U.S.

cms included calcimimetics in the pes rate with effect from
January 1, 2018, following the FDA’s announcement of
approval for the intravenous calcimimetic Parsabiv for adult
dialysis patients. Calcimimetics had previously been available
in oral form only. To gather sufficient analytical data in order
to determine the reimbursement rates, cms has extended the
period for transitional add-on payments for calcimimetics to
2020. In addition, for 2020 and beyond, cms will reduce the
basis of reimbursement for transitional add-ons, including
the transitional add-on for calcimimetics, from an average
sales price of 6 to 0 %.

The introduction of Parsabiv also affects the way in which
some insurers — not including cms — distribute calcimimetics
to their patients. While some patients still obtain calcimimet-
ics from their pharmacy, others are given them by their dialy-
sis provider as a medical service. We receive additional reim-
bursements from several insurers for the calcimimetics
administered at our dialysis clinics. However, as this is the first
time there has been a transition from an exclusively oral drug
to an intravenous one, the reimbursement landscape for non-
cms insurers is still evolving.

From 2021, cms will also make transitional add-on payments
for certain new and innovative dialysis equipment and sup-
plies that are approved after January 1, 2020 and provided by
dialysis facilities. These new machines and supplies must sat-
isfy defined material clinical improvement criteria and will be
reimbursed at 65 % of the invoice price, as determined by
each Medicare Administrative Contractor.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

Quality-based reimbursement

The health care debate in some countries is currently focused
on establishing reimbursement structures based on treatment
quality (pay for performance). In this case, more responsibility
is transferred to the medical service provider. The goal of
reimbursement models of this kind is to maintain a high qual-
ity of care combined with lower overall costs for the health
care system.

The reimbursement system in the u.s. is also an example of a
model based on qualitative criteria. For example, cms defines
quality standards for dialysis centers as part of its quality
improvement program (iP). Failure to reach these standards
can lead to a reduction in annual reimbursements of up to 2 %.

Reimbursement in Care Coordination in the U.S.

We are also working closely with cms in the area of Care
Coordination. One example is our participation in a CMs EsRD
care model: To improve the health of patients with chronic
kidney failure while reducing cms’‘s costs, dialysis providers
and physicians can join together to form entities known as
Escos (End-Stage Renal Disease (esrD) Seamless Care Organi-
zations). We are currently participating through 23 escos in
this pilot project. escos that fulfill the minimum quality stan-
dards specified by the program while generating reductions in
the cost of care above certain thresholds for dialysis patients
covered by the model receive a portion of the cost savings as
reimbursement. Escos that involve dialysis chains with more
than 200 clinics are required to share in the risk of cost
increases and reimburse part of any such increases to cms if
the actual costs exceed the agreed thresholds. Approximately
45,000 patients participated in our escos as at January 1,
2020. The Esco pilot program will run until the end of 2020.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

General information Outlook

Economic Report Corporate Governance fundamentals

Subsequent events

We have also concluded agreements on per capita reimburse-
ments (subcapitations) as well as risk-based and value-based
agreements with certain insurers, which form the basis for
the health care services we offer to private and Medicare
Advantage patients with chronic kidney failure. These agree-
ments determine a basic amount per patient per month. If we
provide complete care at a cost below this amount, we retain
the difference. However, if the cost of complete care exceeds
the basic amount, we may be obliged to pay the difference to
the insurer.

Executive Order of the U.S. President
on new reimbursement models

On July 10, 2019, the u.s. President signed an Executive
Order (Eo) on advancing kidney health. Among other things,
the Eo directs the Department of Health and Human Services
(Hss) to develop new Medicare reimbursement models that
enable diagnosis and treatment earlier in the course of kidney
disease and support the expansion of home dialysis as well as
promoting kidney transplants. One of these, the EsrD Treat-
ment Choices Model (etc Model), is a mandatory model that
creates financial incentives for home dialysis treatments and
kidney transplants. It envisages both positive and negative
payment adjustments to the reimbursement for home dialysis
treatments for a period of three years, as well as a perfor-
mance-based reimbursement adjustment. The — perfor-
mance-based reimbursement adjustment is based on the
rates of home dialysis and kidney transplants and will amount
to between -8 and 5 % in the first reimbursement year and
between - 13 and 10 % in the final reimbursement year. The
start date was originally scheduled for January 2020 but has
been postponed. Hus has not yet set a new implementation
date. However, it has signaled that participants will have
60 days after the final model has been released to start imple-
mentation. The program is proposed to run for six years. Par-
ticipants in the model will be selected at random.

The Executive Order also announced voluntary Medicare
reimbursement models aimed at providing financial incen-
tives for health care providers in the area of chronic kidney
disease and transplantation. Applications for the voluntary
models were submitted in January 2020, but cms has not pro-
vided a timeline for acceptance of the applications. It is still
too early to predict the consequences of the etc reimburse-
ment model and the voluntary models for our business activ-
ities.

Charitable Premium Assistance

At the end of the Obama administration, HHs issued an
Interim Final Rule (ifr) that limited patients’ ability to use
charitable premium assistance (cpa) to enroll in a private plan.
In 2017, this 1FR was temporarily enjoined after Fresenius
Medical Care (along with DaVita, us Renal, and Dialysis
Patients Citizens) sued cms. The judge ruled that cms had not
shown good cause in bypassing the notice and comment pro-
cess, and that the irr was “arbitrary and capricious”, noting
that HHs had failed to consider the benefits of private quali-
fied health plans and ignored the disadvantages of the IFR.

The Trump administration continues to work on this issue and
sent a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing cpa to the
Office of Management and Budget for review in June 2019.
We do not yet know how this new proposed rule will impact
cpa. The HHS identified a target date of November 2019
(11/00/19) for publication, but the proposed rule has not yet
been published for comment. Additionally, there have been
attempts to curtail the usage of cpa or reduce commercial
reimbursement for dialysis patients receiving cpa by state leg-
islatures.

OVERALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
HIGHLIGHTS
Acquisitions and divestitures

On February 21, 2019, Fresenius Medical Care has success-
fully completed the acquisition of NxStage, which was
announced in 2017, following approval by antitrust authori-
ties in the United States. We acquired all of the outstanding
shares of NxStage for $30.00 per common share. The total
acquisition value of this business combination, net of cash
acquired, is $1,976 M (€1,741 M at date of closing). NxStage
is a leading medical technology company that develops, pro-
duces and markets an innovative product portfolio of medical
devices for use in home dialysis and in the critical care setting.
For further information see Note 3 of the notes to the consol-
idated financial statements.

Share buyback program

In February 2019, Fresenius Medical Care has resolved to
repurchase shares of the Company with an aggregate volume
of up to €1 BN via the capital markets over the next two
years. On March 11, 2019 we announced to commence our
share buyback program on the basis of the authorization by
the General Meeting 2016. In the context of this share buy-
back program, we repurchased 3.7 M ordinary shares at a
total purchase price (excluding ancillary transaction costs) of
€270 M in the period from March 12, 2019 until and includ-
ing May 10, 2019. Up to a maximum of 12 M ordinary shares
will be repurchased at a total purchase price (excluding ancil-
lary transaction costs) of up to €660M (approximately
$745 M) in the period from June 17, 2019 until and including
June 17, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, 5.1 M ordinary
shares had been repurchased at a total purchase price (exclud-
ing ancillary transaction costs) of €320 M. The own shares

repurchased by the Company will be used for the sole pur-
pose of reducing the registered share capital by cancellation
of the repurchased own shares. For further information see
NoTE 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Financing

Fresenius Medical Care successfully placed bonds with an
aggregate principal amount of $500 M on June 13, 2019.
The bonds have a maturity of ten years and an annual cou-
pon of 3.750 %. The issue price is 98.461 %, resulting in a
yield of 3.938 %. The proceeds will be used for general cor-
porate purposes, including the refinancing of outstanding
indebtedness.

On November 20, 2019, Fresenius Medical Care additionally
placed bonds in three tranches with an aggregate volume of
€1.75 BN: a €650 M bond with a four-year maturity and a
coupon of 0.250 % at an issuing price of 99.901 % and with
a yield of 0.275 %; a €600 M bond with a seven-year matu-
rity and a coupon of 0.625 % at an issuing price of 99.238 %
and with a yield of 0.737 %; and a €500 M bond with a ten-
year maturity and a coupon of 1.250 % at an issuing price of
99.832 % and with a yield of 1.268 %. The proceeds will
again be used for general corporate purposes, including refi-
nancing of existing bonds. We issued the bonds under our
European Medium-Term Note (EmTN) program.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) agreement

On March 29, 2019, Fresenius Medical Care entered into a
non-prosecution agreement with the United States Depart-
ment of Justice (D0)) and a separate agreement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (sec) intended to resolve
fully and finally the claims against us arising from the investi-
gations. We paid a combined total in penalties and disgorge-
ment of approximately $232 M to the po) and the sec in con-

40

nection with these agreements. The entire amount paid to
DoJ and the sec was reserved for in charges that we recorded
in 2017 and 2018 and announced in 2018. As part of the set-
tlement, we agreed to retain an independent compliance
monitor for a period of at least two years and to an additional
year of self-reporting. As of July 26, 2019, the monitor was
appointed and the monitorship period commenced. For fur-
ther information on these investigations sEE NOTE 22 of the
notes to the consolidated financial statements.

COMPARISON OF ACTUAL BUSINESS RESULTS
WITH THE OUTLOOK

The environment for our core business of dialysis evolved as
expected in 2019. We met the outlook we set ourselves for
the financial year 2019 to a great extent.

Our 2019 outlook did not include the effects of the Fcpa
related charge, the irrs 16 Implementation, the contributions
from Sound in the first half year of 2018 (Sound H1), the
(gain) loss related to divestitures of Care Coordination activi-
ties, costs associated with the sustainable improvement of
our cost base (Cost Optimization Costs) as well as all effects
from the acquisition of NxStage. We have therefore adjusted
the actual results for 2019 accordingly to make them compa-
rable with the 2019 outlook. The basis 2018 for the outlook
2019 was adjusted for the (gain) loss related to divestitures of
Care Coordination activities, the FcPA related charge as well
as Sound H1. A reconciliation of the results 2019 and 2018 to
the respective results 2019 and 2018 adjusted is given at
TABLES 2.15 AND 2.16 ON PAGE 42.

The outlook for the 2019 financial year was based on the pre-
vailing exchange rates at the beginning of the year 2019. We
expected adjusted revenue growth in the range of 3 to 7 %
at Constant Currency at the beginning of the year. We gener-
ated adjusted revenue of €17.3 BN. At Constant Currency,

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

revenue increased by 5 % on an adjusted basis. We therefore
met our expectations.

All operating segments, but above all the North America and
Asia-Pacific Segments contributed to the expansion of our
business. Further details on the development of revenue can
be found in the section “Results of operations, financial posi-
tion and net assets” starting on PAGE 42.

We expected our adjusted operating income to develop in
the range of -1 to 3 % at Constant Currency in the 2019
financial year. The adjusted operating income for 2019 was
€2.3 BN. Compared to the prior year the operating income
decreased by 4 % on an adjusted basis. We therefore did not
meet our expectations.

We expected adjusted Delivered Operating Income to develop
in the range of -1 to 3 % at Constant Currency in 2019. The
Delivered Operating Income for 2019 was €2.1 BN on an
adjusted basis and decreased at Constant Currency by 3 % on
an adjusted basis. We therefore did not meet our expectations.

At the beginning of the year, we set a target range for
adjusted net income development of -2 to 2 % at Constant
Currency for the 2019 financial year. On an adjusted basis,
net income for 2019 decreased by 2 % to €1.4 BN at Con-
stant Currency, which is within the range of our expectations.

Basic earnings per share decreased by 1 % at Constant Cur-
rency on an adjusted basis. This decrease is in line with the
development of net income and shares outstanding, as we
expected.

We earmarked €1.0 BN to €1.2 BN for capital expenditures.
With an outlay of €1.1 BN, we remained within our outlook.
We expected to spend around €0.4 BN to €0.6 BN on acqui-
sitions and investments (adjusted for the acquisition of

NxStage). The adjusted actual figure was €0.5 BN with respect
to acquisitions and investments (excluding investments in
debt securities) and we therefore met our expectations. For
further information, see the section “Results of operations,
financial position and net assets” starting on PAGE 42.

Driven by earnings development and the good development
in Days Sales Outstanding, adjusted net cash provided by
(used in) operating activities in percent of revenue was high
at 12.0 %, meeting our expectation of greater than 10 %.

Adjusted Free cash flow in percent of revenue was 5.9 % in
2019, which is also in line with our expectation of greater
than 4 %.

According to our forecast, the adjusted net leverage ratio
should have been below 2.5 at the end of 2019. Adjusted net
leverage ratio was at 1.9 at the balance sheet date and is
therefore as expected.

The adjusted roc was at 8.0 %. Therefore, RoIc was within
our expectation of at least 8.0 %.

The proposed dividend per share of €1.20 to be approved by
the Annual General Meeting on May 19, 2020 is within our
expectation (in line with the development of the adjusted net
income and shares outstanding).

The number of employees at Fresenius Medical Care (full-
time equivalents) increased from 112,658 at the end of 2018
to 120,659 at the end of 2019. Exlcuding the acquisition of
NxStage the number was 117,009. The number of employees
therefore met our expectations of more than 117,000 full-
time equivalents.

Research and development expenditures aimed at boosting
Fresenius Medical Care's ability to adapt to future require-

Al

did not achieve our expected range of €160 M to €170 M.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,
FINANCIAL POSITION
AND NET ASSETS

The following sections summarize our results of operations,
financial position and net assets as well as key performance
indicators by reporting segment, as well as Corporate, for the
periods indicated.

We prepared the information consistent with the manner in
which management internally disaggregates financial infor-
mation to assist in making operating decisions and evaluating
management performance.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For further information on the results of operations of
Fresenius Medical Care, SEE TABLE 2.17 ON PAGE 43.

Revenue and operating income generated in countries out-
side the eurozone are subject to currency fluctuations. The
year ended December 31, 2019 was positively impacted by
the development of the euro against the u.s. dollar whereas
the year ended December 31, 2018 was negatively impacted
by the development of the euro against the u.s. dollar. In the
twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019, approxi-
mately 70 % of revenue and approximately 79 % of operat-
ing income were generated in u.s. dollars.

Consolidated financial statements

For an overview of the key indicators for the consolidated
financial statements, SEE TABLE 2.18 ON PAGE 44.

Health care services revenue increased by 5 %. In addition to
a 4% positive impact from foreign currency translation,
health care services revenue increased by 1 % as growth in
same market treatments (4 %), contributions from acquisi-
tions (2 %) and increases in organic revenue per treatment
(1 %), were largely offset by decreases attributable to prior
year revenue associated with the divested Sound activities as
well as the effect of closed or sold clinics (5 %) and a revenue
recognition adjustment of €170 M for accounts receivable in
legal dispute (1 %) (SEE NOTE 22 of the notes to the consoli-
dated financial statements).

Dialysis treatments increased by 4 % as a result of growth in
same market treatments (4 %) and contributions from acqui-
sitions (1 %), partially offset by the effect of closed or sold
clinics (1 %).

At December 31, 2019, we owned, operated or managed
3,994 dialysis clinics (excluding those managed but not con-
solidated in the u.s.) compared to 3,928 dialysis clinics at
December 31, 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2019,
we acquired 47 dialysis clinics, opened 123 dialysis clinics and
combined or closed 104 clinics. The number of patients
treated in dialysis clinics that we own, operate or manage
(excluding patients of dialysis clinics managed but not consol-
idated in the u.s.) increased by 4 % to 345,096 at Decem-
ber 31, 2019 (December 31, 2018: 333,331).

Health care product revenue increased by 10 %, including a
2% positive impact from foreign currency translation. At
Constant Exchange Rates, health care product revenue
increased by 8 %. Dialysis product revenue increased by

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

10 %. In addition to a 2 % positive impact from foreign cur-
rency translation, dialysis product revenue increased by 8 %
driven by higher sales of home hemodialysis products (largely
as a result of the acquisition of NxStage), dialyzers, hemodial-
ysis solutions and concentrates, renal pharmaceuticals, blood-
lines, peritoneal dialysis products and products for acute care
treatments, partially offset by lower sales of machines as a
result of changes in the accounting treatment for sale-lease-
back transactions due to the IFrs 16 Implementation. Non-di-
alysis product revenue increased by 3 % to €76M from
€74 M with virtually no foreign currency translation effects.
Non-dialysis product revenue increased due to higher sales of
acute cardiopulmonary products.

The decrease period over period in the gross profit margin
was 0.3 percentage points. Foreign currency translation
effects represented a 0.1 percentage point increase in the
current period. The decrease primarily reflects decreases in
the emeA Segment, the North America Segment and an unfa-
vorable mix effect from the varying margins across our report-
ing segments, partially offset by an increase in the Asia-Pacific
Segment. The decrease in the EMEA Segment was mainly
driven by higher personnel expense in certain countries. The
decrease in the North America Segment was mainly attribut-
able to higher personnel expense, a revenue recognition
adjustment for accounts receivable in legal dispute (sce
NOTE 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements
included in this report) and the effect of a reduction in patient
attribution and a decreasing savings rate for escos (loss rate
for 2019) based on recent reports for current and prior plan
years (“Esco effect"), partially offset by a positive impact
from higher utilization of oral based ancillaries with favorable
margins, a favorable effect from the IFrs 16 Implementation,
the positive current year effect from the divestiture of Sound
which operated at lower margins and the impact from the
acquisition of NxStage. The increase in the Asia-Pacific Seg-
ment was largely due to favorable impacts from business

growth and the Irrs 16 Implementation, partially offset by an
unfavorable impact from acquisitions with lower margins.

The increase period over period in the selling, general and
administrative (“sGéA") expenses as a percentage of revenue
was 0.1 percentage points with virtually no impact from for-
eign currency translation. The increase was primarily driven
by increases in the North America Segment and the Asia-
Pacific Segment, partially offset by favorable impacts in the
EMEA Segment and Corporate. The increase in the North
America Segment was mainly driven by the effect from the
integration and operational costs associated with NxStage,
costs associated with the sustainable improvement of our
cost base (“Cost Optimization Costs”), higher personnel

expense as well as higher stock compensation expense, par-
tially offset by the remeasurement effect on the fair value of
the Humacyte investment, the prior year effects from u.s. Bal-
lot Initiatives and the discontinuation of a non-iFRs policy
with no associated cash flow effect. The increase in the
Asia-Pacific Segment was due to the impact from business
growth, an unfavorable impact from Care Coordination and
an unfavorable effect from Cost Optimization Costs, partially
offset by favorable foreign currency transaction effects. The
decrease in the EMEA Segment was largely due to a reduction
of a contingent consideration liability related to Xenios AG
(“Xenios”), higher other income related to a favorable out-
come in a legal proceeding, favorable foreign currency trans-
action effects and a positive impact from acquisitions, par-

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

tially offset by higher bad debt expense and Cost Optimization
Costs. The favorable impact in Corporate was driven by an
accrual for FcPa related charge in the prior year (SEE NOTE 22
of the notes the consolidated financial statements included in
this report).

The gain related to divestitures of Care Coordination activities
decreased to €29 M from €809 M primarily due to the dives-
titure of Sound in 2018.

Research and development expenses increased by 47 % to
€168 M from €114 M. The period over period increase as a
percentage of revenue, was 0.3 percentage points, largely
driven by research and development activities at NxStage,
in-center and home program development as well as higher
costs related to pre-development activities and research activ-
ities in the field of regenerative medicine.

Income from equity method investees increased slightly to
€74 M from €73 M. The slight increase was primarily driven
by higher income from Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal
Pharma Ltd., an entity in which we have ownership of 45 %,
mainly due to higher sales of renal pharmaceuticals.

The decrease period over period in the operating income
margin was 5.4 percentage points. Foreign currency transla-
tion effects represented a 0.1 percentage point increase in
the current period. The decrease in the current period was
largely driven by the lower gain related to divestitures of Care
Coordination activities as discussed above.

Delivered Operating Income decreased by 27 %. In addition
to a 3 % positive impact from foreign currency translation,
Delivered Operating Income decreased by 30 % largely driven
by decreased operating income.

Subsequent events

Net interest expense increased by 43 % to €429™M from
€301 M. In addition to a 6 % negative impact from foreign
currency translation, net interest expense increased by 37 %
primarily due to the irRs 16 Implementation and a higher
debt level, partially offset by the replacement of high inter-
est-bearing bonds by debt instruments at lower interest rates.

Income tax expense decreased by 21% to €402 M from
€511M. The effective tax rate increased to 21.8 % from
18.7 % for the same period of 2018 largely driven by prior
year impacts from favorable implications of the u.s. tax
reform, the gain related to the divestiture of Care Coordina-
tion activities in 2018 and favorable prior year tax impacts
from the Fcpa related charge, partially offset by non-tax
deductible expenses related to u.s. Ballot Initiatives.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased
by 2 % to €239 M from €244 M. In addition to a 5 % nega-
tive impact from foreign currency translation, net income
attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by 7 % due
to lower performance in entities in which we have less than
100 % ownership.

Net income attributable to shareholders of FMc AG & CO. KGAA
decreased by 39 % to €1,200 M from €1,982 M. In addition
to a 3 % positive impact from foreign currency translation,
net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & CO. KGAA
decreased by 42 % driven by the combined effects of the
items discussed above.

Basic earnings per share decreased by 39 %. In addition to a
2 % positive impact from foreign currency translation, basic
earnings per share decreased by 41 % primarily due to the
decrease in net income attributable to shareholders of FMc AG
& CO. KGAA described above. The average weighted number
of shares outstanding for the period decreased to approxi-

mately 302.7 M in 2019 (2018: 306.5 M), primarily as a result
of our share buyback program.

We employed 120,659 people (full-time equivalents) as of
December 31, 2019 (December 31, 2018: 112,658). This 7 %
increase was primarily due to the NxStage acquisition.

Consolidated operating performance on an
adjusted basis

Management believes that there are certain distinct transac-
tions or events for which the operating results should be
adjusted to enhance transparency and comparability. We
believe the following results (adjusted to exclude these items)
should be analyzed in connection with the results presented
above. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we
identified the following transactions which, when excluded
from the results disclosed above, may provide a reader with
further useful information in assessing our performance:

» an adjustment to the 2019 presentation to remove the
effects of the IFRs 16 Implementation

» an adjustment to the 2019 presentation to remove the con-
tribution of NxStage to conform to the 2018 presentation
(NxStage Operations)

» an adjustment to the 2019 presentation to remove the inte-
gration costs related to the acquisition of NxStage on Febru-
ary 21, 2019 (NxStage Costs)

» an adjustment to the 2019 presentation to remove the Cost
Optimization Costs

» an adjustment to the 2018 presentation to remove the con-
tribution of Sound to conform to the 2019 presentation
(Sound H1)

>» an adjustment to remove the gain related to divestitures of
Care Coordination activities (SEE NOTE 4 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements) ((Gain) loss related to
divestitures of Care Coordination activities)

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

> an adjustment to the 2018 presentation to remove the FcPA
related charge

TABLE 2.19 ON PAGE 46 reconciles the key indicators for the
consolidated financial statements in accordance with iFrs to
the key indicators adjusted for the items described above, as
the adjustments allow for a better comparison of these key
indicators to our Outlook 2019 presented in the section
“Comparison of actual business results to the outlook” in the
chapter “Overall business development” starting on PAGE 40.
While we believe these adjustments provide additional clarity
to the discussion of our operating results, TABLE 2.19 ON
PAGE 46 should only be viewed as a supplement to our results
disclosed in accordance with IFrs above.

Segment reporting

The following discussions pertain to the North America Seg-
ment, the emeA Segment, the Asia-Pacific Segment and the

medical cost under management calculations below. In the
future, other programs may be included in the metrics below,
including Bec! Advanced, a similar initiative to Beci that began
October 1, 2018 and is scheduled to extend through Decem-
ber 31, 2023. We commenced participation under the pci
Advanced in January 2020 through a physician practice,
which is majority-owned by National Cardiovascular Partners.
Note that due to the timing required by cms to review the
BPcl and Esco program data that we provide, estimates have
been used to report these metrics in a timely manner. The
Asia-Pacific Segment Care Coordination metric currently used
for discussion purposes is patient encounters.

These metrics may be developed further in future periods.
These metrics are neither IFRS measures nor non-iFRS mea-
sures and are therefore not accompanied by or reconciled to
IFRS Measures.

Member months under medical cost management

In our North America Segment, member months under med-
ical cost management is calculated by multiplying the num-
ber of members included in value-based reimbursement
programs, such as Medicare Advantage plans or other
value-based programs in the u.s., by the corresponding num-
ber of months these members participate in those programs
(Member Months). In the aforementioned programs, we
assume the risk associated with generating savings. The
financial results are recorded in earnings as our performance
is determined. The membership offerings within Care Coordi-
nation are sub-capitation arrangements, MA-csnpPs (until
December 31, 2018), Esco and speci (until June 28, 2018 - see
Note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements)
programs as well as other shared savings programs. An
increase in patient membership may indicate future earnings
or losses as our performance is determined through these
managed care programs.

Medical cost under management

In our North America Segment, medical cost under manage-
ment represents the management of medical costs associated
with our patient membership in value-based programs. For
Esco, BPci (until June 28, 2018 - sEE NOTE 4 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements) and other shared savings
programs, this is calculated by multiplying the Member
Months in each program by the benchmark of expected med-
ical costs per member per month. The sub-capitation and
ma-csnps calculation multiplies the premium per member of
the program per month by the number of member months
associated with the plan, as noted above.

Care Coordination patient encounters

In the North America Segment and the Asia-Pacific Segment,
Care Coordination patient encounters represents the total
patient encounters and procedures conducted by certain of
our Care Coordination activities and, we believe, is an indica-
tor of the revenue generated. Care Coordination patient
encounters in the North America Segment is the sum of all
encounters and procedures completed during the period by
Sound until June 28, 2018 (see Note 4 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements), MedSpring Urgent Care
Centers, Azura Vascular Care, and National Cardiovascular
Partners, the trade name of Laurus Healthcare L.P., as well as
patients in our Fresenius Medical Care Rx Bone Mineral
Metabolism (Rx MM) program.

Care Coordination patient encounters in the Asia-Pacific Seg-
ment is the sum of all encounters for the following services:
ambulant treatment services in day care hospitals, compre-
hensive and specialized health check-ups, inpatient and out-
patient services, vascular access and other chronic treatment
services.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

North America Segment

Information about key indicators and business metrics for the
North America Segment can be found in TaBLE 2.20 ON
PAGE 48.

Dialysis

Revenue

Dialysis revenue increased by 11 % including a 6 % positive
impact resulting from foreign currency translation. At Con-
stant Exchange Rates, dialysis revenue increased by 5 %.
Dialysis revenue is comprised of dialysis care revenue and
health care product revenue.

Dialysis care revenue increased by 10 % to €9,973 M from
€9,089 M. In addition to a 6 % positive impact from foreign
currency translation, dialysis care revenue increased by 4 %
mainly due to growth in same market treatments (3 %),
increases in organic revenue per treatment (2 %) and contri-
butions from acquisitions (1 %), partially offset by a revenue
recognition adjustment of €170 M for accounts receivable in
legal dispute (2 %) (SEE NOTE 22 of the notes to the consoli-
dated financial statements).

Dialysis treatments increased by 4 % largely due to growth in
same market treatments (3 %) and contributions from acqui-
sitions (1 %). At December 31, 2019, 211,064 patients, an
increase of 3 % (December 31, 2018: 204,107), were treated
in the 2,579 dialysis clinics (December 31, 2018: 2,529) that
we own or operate in the North America Segment.

In the u.s., the average revenue per treatment decreased to
$352 (€298 at Constant Exchange Rates) from $354 (€300)
largely due to a revenue recognition adjustment of €170 M
for accounts receivable in legal dispute and lower revenue
from commercial payors, partially offset by higher utilization

of oral based ancillaries and the impact from an increase in
the esrD pps base rate.

Cost per treatment in the u.s., adjusted for the effects from
the iFrs 16 Implementation, increased to $296 (€250 at Con-
stant Exchange Rates) from $289 (€245). This increase was
largely driven by higher personnel expense, higher costs for
medical supplies, the integration and operational costs asso-
ciated with NxStage and higher depreciation expense, par-
tially offset by lower costs for renal pharmaceuticals.

Health care product revenue increased by 23 %. In addition
to a 7 % positive impact from foreign currency translation,
health care product revenue increased by 16 % driven by
higher sales of home hemodialysis products, renal pharma-
ceuticals, dialyzers, peritoneal dialysis products, and hemodi-
alysis solutions and concentrates, partially offset by lower
sales of machines as a result of changes in the accounting
treatment for sale-leaseback transactions in accordance with
the IFrs 16 Implementation.

Operating income margin

The decrease period over period in the dialysis operating
income margin was 1.8 percentage points including a 0.1 per-
centage point negative impact from foreign currency transla-
tion in the current period. The decrease was due to higher
personnel expense, a revenue recognition adjustment for
accounts receivable in legal dispute (see NOTE 22 of the notes
the consolidated financial statements included in this report),
the integration and operational costs associated with
NxStage, and Cost Optimization Costs, partially offset by a
favorable impact from higher utilization of oral based ancil-
laries with favorable margins, the remeasurement effect on
the fair value of our Humacyte investment, a positive effect
from the irrRs 16 Implementation, the prior year effect from
the u.s. Ballot Initiatives, and discontinuation of a non-iFRS
policy with no associated cash flow effect.

Economic Report Corporate Governance fundamentals

Subsequent events

Delivered Operating Income

Dialysis Delivered Operating Income decreased by 1 %. In
addition to a 4% positive impact from foreign currency
translation, Delivered Operating Income decreased by 5 %
mainly as a result of decreased operating income.

Care Coordination

Revenue

Care Coordination revenue decreased by 28 %. In addition to
a3 % positive impact from foreign currency translation, Care
Coordination revenue decreased by 31 % largely driven by
decreases attributable to prior year revenue associated with
the divested Sound activities (33 %) and a decrease in organic
revenue, including the esco effect (1 %), partially offset by
contributions from acquisitions (3 %).

Operating income margin

The decrease period over period in the Care Coordination
operating income margin was 51.0 percentage points, includ-
ing a 0.1 percentage point negative impact from foreign cur-
rency translation in the current period. The decrease was
mainly due to lower gains related to divestiture of Care Coor-
dination activities, the Esco effect, lower volumes for phar-
macy services as well as unfavorable margins for oral based
ancillaries, partially offset by a positive effect from the IFrs 16
Implementation.

Delivered Operating Income

Care Coordination Delivered Operating Income decreased by
96 % with virtually no impact from foreign currency transla-
tion. Delivered Operating Income decreased mainly as a result
of decreased operating income.

Care Coordination business metrics

Member months under medical cost management remained
relatively stable as the expansion of our existing Escos through
the addition of new physician practice partners and dialysis
facilities since the beginning of 2018 was mostly offset by the
divestment of our controlling interest in Sound on June 28,
2018 and, as a result, the conclusion of our participation in
BPCI. SEE NOTE 4 of the notes to consolidated financial state-
ments and note 4 to TABLE 2.20 ON PAGE 48.

Care Coordination’s medical cost under management
increased by 1 %. Including a 6 % positive impact from for-
eign currency translation, Care Coordination’s medical cost
under management decreased by 5 % primarily due to the
divestment of our controlling interest in Sound on June 28,
2018 (SEE NoTE 4 of the notes to consolidated financial state-
ments) and, as a result, the conclusion of our participation in
BPCI as well as a decrease in member months attributable to
ma-csnps, which we no longer provide as of January 2019.
This decrease was partially offset by the expansion of our
existing escos through the addition of new physician practice
partners and dialysis facilities since the beginning of 2018 as
well as an increase in member months attributable to sub-cap-
itation programs. See note 4 to TABLE 2.20 ON PAGE 48.

The decrease in patient encounters was primarily driven by
decreased encounters for hospital related physician services
as a result of the divestiture of our controlling interest in
Sound on June 28, 2018. see NOTE 4 of the notes to consoli-
dated financial statements and note 4 to TABLE 2.20 ON

North America Segment operating performance
on an adjusted basis

Management believes that there are certain distinct transac-
tions or events for which the operating results should be
adjusted to enhance transparency and comparability. We
believe the following results (adjusted to exclude these items)
should be analyzed in connection with the results presented
above. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,
we identified the following transactions that, when excluded
from the results disclosed above, may provide a reader with
further useful information in assessing our performance:

> an adjustment to the 2019 presentation to remove
the effects of the iFrs 16 Implementation

> an adjustment to the 2019 presentation to remove
the NxStage Operations

> an adjustment to the 2019 presentation to remove
the NxStage Costs

> an adjustment to the 2019 presentation to remove
the Cost Optimization Costs

> an adjustment to the 2018 presentation to remove
Sound H1

> an adjustment to remove the (Gain) loss related
to divestitures of Care Coordination activities

TABLE 2.21 ON PAGE 50 reconciles the key indicators for the
North America Segment in accordance with Irrs to the key
indicators adjusted for the items described above as the
adjustments allow for a better comparison of these key indi-
cators to our Outlook 2019 presented in the section “Com-
parison of actual business results to the outlook” in the chap-
ter “Overall business development”. While we believe these
adjustments provide additional clarity to the discussion of our
operating results, TABLE 2.21 ON PAGE 50 should only be
viewed as a supplement to our results disclosed in accordance
with iFrs above.

EMEA Segment

Information about key indicators for the EMEA Segment can
be found in TABLE 2.22.

Revenue

Health care service revenue increased by 6 %. Including a
1 % negative impact resulting from foreign currency transla-
tion, health care service revenue increased by 7 % largely as
aresult of growth in same market treatments (3 %), increases
in organic revenue per treatment (3 %), and contributions
from acquisitions (2 %), partially offset by the effect of closed
or sold clinics (1 %).

Dialysis treatments increased by 3 % mainly due to growth in
same market treatments (3 %) and contributions from acqui-
sitions (2 %), partially offset by the effect of closed or sold
clinics (2 %). As of December 31, 2019, 66,217 patients, an

increase of 2 % (December 31, 2018: 65,061) were treated
at the 781 dialysis clinics (December 31, 2018: 776) that we
own, operate or manage in the EMEA Segment.

Health care product revenue increased by 2 %, with virtually
no impact from foreign currency translation. Dialysis product
revenue increased by 2 % due to higher sales of machines,
products for acute care treatments, bloodlines and peritoneal
dialysis products. Non-Dialysis product revenue increased by
3% to €76M from €74M largely due to higher sales of
acute cardiopulmonary products.

Operating income margin

The increase period over period in the operating income mar-
gin was 1.2 percentage points. Foreign currency translation
effects represented a 0.1 percentage point decrease in the
operating income margin. The increase was mainly due to a
reduction of a contingent consideration liability related to

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

Xenios, a positive impact from the iFRs 16 Implementation,
higher other income related to a favorable outcome in a legal
proceeding, and a favorable impact from acquisitions, par-
tially offset by higher personnel expense in certain countries
as well as higher bad debt expense.

Delivered Operating Income

Delivered Operating Income increased by 12 %. Including a
1 % negative impact resulting from foreign currency transla-
tion, Delivered Operating Income increased by 13 % primarily
due to increased operating income.

Asia-Pacific Segment

Information about key indicators and business metrics for the
Asia-Pacific Segment can be found in TABLE 2.23 ON PAGE 52.

Dialysis

Revenue

Dialysis revenue increased by 9 % including a 3 % positive
impact resulting from foreign currency translation. At Con-
stant Exchange Rates, dialysis revenue increased by 6 %.
Dialysis revenue is comprised of dialysis care revenue and
health care product revenue.

Dialysis care service revenue increased by 9 % to €621M
from €568 M. Including a 5 % positive impact resulting from
foreign currency translation, dialysis care service revenue
increased by 4 % as a result of growth in same market treat-
ments (7 %) and contributions from acquisitions (1 %), par-
tially offset by the effect of closed or sold clinics (3 %) and a
decrease in organic revenue per treatment (1 %).

Dialysis treatments increased by 5 % mainly due to growth in
same market treatments (7 %) and contributions from acqui-

sitions (1 %), partially offset by the effect of closed or sold
clinics (3 %). As of December 31, 2019, 33,005 patients, an
increase of 5 % (December 31, 2018: 31,476) were treated
at the 400 dialysis clinics (December 31, 2018: 394) that we
own, operate or manage in the Asia-Pacific Segment.

Health care product revenue increased by 9 %. Including a
1 % positive impact resulting from foreign currency transla-
tion, health care product revenue increased by 8 % as a result
of increased sales of dialyzers, bloodlines, hemodialysis solu-
tions and concentrates products as well as for acute care
treatments, partially offset by lower sales of machines.

Operating income margin

The increase period over period in the operating income mar-
gin was 0.3 percentage points. Foreign currency translation
effects represented a 0.1 percentage point decrease in the
operating income margin. The increase was primarily due to
favorable impacts from foreign currency transaction effects
as well as a positive effect from the irrs 16 Implementation,
partially offset by an effect from Cost Optimization Costs.

Delivered Operating Income

Delivered Operating Income increased by 11 %. Including a
2 % positive impact resulting from foreign currency transla-
tion, Dialysis Operating Income increased by 9 % mainly due
to increased operating income.

Care Coordination

Revenue

Care Coordination revenue increased by 16 %. Including a
3 % positive impact resulting from foreign currency transla-
tion, Care Coordination revenue increased by 13 % driven by
organic revenue growth (7 %) and contributions from acqui-
sitions (6 %).

Subsequent events

Operating income margin

The decrease period over period in the Care Coordination
operating income margin was 4.1 percentage points. Foreign
currency translation effects represented a 0.2 percentage
point decrease in the operating income margin. The decrease
was driven by higher start-up and operating costs as well as
an unfavorable mix effect from acquisitions with lower mar-
gins, partially offset by a positive effect from the irRs 16
Implementation.

Delivered Operating Income

Care Coordination Delivered Operating Income decreased by
11 %. Including a 1 % positive impact resulting from foreign
currency translation, Care Coordination Delivered Operating
Income decreased by 12 % mainly as a result of decreased
operating income.

Care Coordination business metrics

The number of patient encounters increased due to increased
encounters for comprehensive and specialized health check-
ups as well as ambulant treatment services, inpatient and
outpatient services, vascular access and other chronic treat-
ment services.

Latin America Segment

Information about key indicators for the Latin America Seg-
ment can be found in TABLE 2.24.

Revenue

Health care service revenue increased by 2 %. Including a
23 % negative impact resulting from foreign currency trans-
lation, health care service revenue increased by 25 % as a
result of increases in organic revenue per treatment (18 %),
contributions from acquisitions (5 %) and growth in same
market treatments (2 %).

Dialysis treatments increased by 6 % mainly due to contribu-
tions from acquisitions (4 %) and growth in same market
treatments (2 %). As of December 31, 2019, 34,810 patients,
an increase of 6% (December 31, 2018: 32,687) were
treated at the 234 dialysis clinics (December 31, 2018: 229)
that we own, operate or manage in the Latin America Seg-
ment.

Health care product revenue increased by 6 %. Including a
6 % negative impact resulting from foreign currency transla-
tion, health care product revenue increased by 12 % due to
higher sales of hemodialysis solutions and concentrates,
machines, peritoneal dialysis products and products for acute
care treatments, partially offset by lower sales of dialyzers.

Operating income margin

The increase period over period in the operating income mar-
gin was 1.8 percentage points. Foreign currency translation

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

effects represented a 1.3 percentage point increase in the
operating income margin in the current period. The increase
was mainly due to favorable foreign currency transaction
effects, a reimbursement rate increase in Chile and a positive
impact from acquisitions, partially offset by the impact from
hyperinflation and an increase in bad debt.

Delivered Operating Income

Delivered Operating Income increased by 47 %. Including a

able proportion of debt, through the employment of an
extensive mix of debt. We still regard our refinancing options
as being very stable and flexible. During the fiscal year, the
focus of our investing activities was on our health care ser-
vices business.

Financial management policies and goals

Besides optimizing our financial costs, our financing strategy
gives top priority to ensuring financial flexibility. We remain
flexible by using a wide range of financial instruments and
being highly diversified with regard to our investors and
banks. Our financing profile is characterized by a wide range
of maturities up to 2029.

Our main mid- and long-term financing instruments are the
Amended 2012 Credit Agreement (a syndicated credit agree-
ment with revolving credit facilities and long-term loans in
u.s. dollar and euro) as well as bonds in u.s. dollar and euro.
Short-term financing needs are covered by issuances under
our commercial paper program in euro, the Accounts Receiv-
able Facility in u.s. dollar and bilateral credit facilities.

In our long-term financial planning, we focus primarily on the
net leverage ratio, a non-IFRs measure. At December 31, 2019,
the net leverage ratio was 3.2 (2018: 1.8). Adjusted for the
IFRS 16 Implementation, the net leverage ratio was 2.5 at
December 31, 2019. See “Performance management system”
— “Net leverage ratio (Non-IFRs measure)” starting On PAGE 26.

The key financial risks we are exposed to include foreign
exchange risk and interest rate risk. To manage these risks,
we enter into various hedging transactions with banks that
have been authorized by the Management Board and which
generally have ratings in the “A” category or better. We do
not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative
purposes (for financial risks, see section “Other risks” in

chapter “Risks and Opportunities Report” starting on PAGE 72
as well as NoTE 23 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements).

Fresenius se, under a service agreement, conducts financial
instrument activities for us under the control of a single cen-
tralized department. We have established guidelines for risk
management procedures and controls including the use of
financial instruments. These guidelines include a clear segre-
gation of duties with regards to execution on the one hand
and administration, accounting and controlling on the other.

We also utilize Fresenius se’s cash management system as
well as an unsecured loan agreement with Fresenius se (SEE
NoTe 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial state-
ments).

Rating

We are rated investment grade by the three leading rating agen-
cies, Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch - (SEE TABLE 2.25).

We are not involved in off-balance-sheet transactions that
are likely to materially affect our financial position, results

of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, assets or
capitalization.

Sources of liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are typically cash provided by
operating activities, cash provided by short-term debt from
third parties and related parties, proceeds from the issuance
of long-term debt and divestitures. We require this capital pri-
marily to finance working capital needs, fund acquisitions,
operate clinics, develop free-standing renal dialysis clinics and
other health care facilities, purchase equipment for existing
or new renal dialysis clinics and production sites, repay debt,
pay dividends and repurchase shares, (see “Net cash provided
by (used in) investing activities” starting on PAGE 56 and “Net
cash provided by (used in) financing activities” starting on
PAGE 56).

At December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of
€1,008 M (December 31, 2018: €2,146 M).

Free cash flow (net cash provided by (used in) operating activ-
ities, after capital expenditures, before acquisitions and
investments) in 2019 amounted to €1,454M (2018:
€1,059 M). Free cash flow is a Non-iFrs Measure and is recon-
ciled to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the
most directly comparable irrs measure in chapter “Perfor-
mance management system” starting on PAGE 24. Free cash
flow in percent of revenue was 8.3 % in 2019 (2018: 6.4 %).

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities

During 2019 we generated net cash provided by operating
activities of €2,567 M (2018: €2,062 M). Net cash provided
by operating activities in percent of revenue was 15 % for
2019 (2018: 12 %). Cash provided by (used in) operating
activities is impacted by the profitability of our business, the

Subsequent events

development of our working capital, principally inventories,
receivables and cash outflows that occur due to a number of
specific items as discussed below. The increase in net cash
provided by operating activities was largely driven by the iFrs
16 Implementation leading to a reclassification of the repay-
ment portion of rent to financing activities in the amount of
€669 M.

The profitability of our business depends significantly on
reimbursement rates for our services. Approximately 79 % of
our revenue is generated by providing health care services, a
major portion of which is reimbursed by either public health
care organizations or private insurers. In 2019, approximately
33 % of our consolidated revenue was attributable to reim-
bursements from u.s. federal health care benefit programs,
such as Medicare and Medicaid. Legislative changes could
affect Medicare reimbursement rates for a significant portion
of the services we provide, as well as the scope of Medicare
coverage. A decrease in reimbursement rates or the scope of
coverage could have a material adverse effect on our busi-
ness, financial position and results of operations and thus on
our Capacity to generate cash flow.

In recent years, the stability of reimbursement in the u.s. has
been affected by (i) the implementation of the Esro pps in Jan-
uary 2011, (ii) across-the-board spending cuts in payments to
Medicare providers by the u.s. federal government, com-
monly referred to as “u.s. Sequestration", (iii) the phased
reduction to the esrD pps rate to account for the decline in
utilization of certain drugs and biologicals associated with
dialysis pursuant to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012
(“aTRA") as subsequently modified under the Protecting
Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“Pama”) and (iv) cms’s 2017
final rule on the Physician Fee Schedule, which partially cor-
rected reimbursement for certain procedures that were mate-
rially undervalued in 2016.

Or
or

We intend to continue to address our current cash and financ-
ing requirements using cash provided by operating activities,
our existing and future credit agreements, issuances under
our commercial paper program (SEE NOTE 13 of the notes to
the consolidated financial statements) as well as from the use
of our Accounts Receivable Facility. In addition, to finance
acquisitions or meet other needs, we expect to successfully
complete long-term financing arrangements, such as the
issuance of bonds. We aim to preserve financial resources
with a minimum of €500 M of committed and unutilized
credit facilities.

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities depends
on the collection of accounts receivable. Commercial custom-
ers and government institutions generally have different pay-
ment cycles. Lengthening their payment cycles could have a
material adverse effect on our capacity to generate cash flow.
In addition, we could face difficulties in enforcing and collect-
ing accounts receivable under the legal systems and due to
the economic conditions in some countries. Accounts receiv-
able balances, net of valuation allowances, represented Days
Sales Outstanding (pso) of 73 days at December 31, 2019, a
decrease as compared to 75 days at December 31, 2018.

bso by segment is calculated by dividing the segment’s
accounts and other receivable and contract liabilities, con-
verted to euro using the average exchange rate for the period
presented, less any sales or value added tax included in the
receivables, by the average daily sales for the last twelve
months of that segment, converted to euro using the average
exchange rate for the period. Receivables and revenues are
adjusted for amounts related to acquisitions and divestitures
made within the reporting period with a purchase price above
a €50 M threshold as defined in the Amended 2012 Credit
Agreement.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

The development of pso by reporting segment is shown in
TABLE 2.26.

The pso decrease in the North America Segment was largely
due to a revenue recognition adjustment for accounts receiv-
able in legal dispute (see NoTE 22 of the notes to the consoli-
dated financial statements), partially offset by business
growth. The decrease in the pso for the EmeA Segment pri-
marily related to increased bad debt reserves in the region.
The decrease in the Asia-Pacific Segment was driven by an
improvement of payment collections in China. The increase in
the Latin America Segment reflects periodic delays in pay-
ment of public health care organizations in certain countries.

Due to the fact that a large portion of our reimbursement is
provided by public health care organizations and private
insurers, we expect that most of our accounts receivable will
be collectible.

We are subject to ongoing and future tax audits in the u.s.,
Germany and other jurisdictions. With respect to these poten-
tial adjustments and disallowances of tax matters currently
under review, we do not anticipate that an unfavorable ruling
could have a material impact on our results of operations. We
are not currently able to determine the timing of these poten-
tial additional tax payments.

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities was €3,286 M for 2019
(2018: €245 M). TABLE 2.27 ON PAGE 56 shows our capital
expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of pro-
ceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment as well as
acquisitions, investments and purchases of intangible assets
for 2019 and 2018.

The majority of our capital expenditures were used for main-
taining existing clinics, equipping new clinics, maintaining
and expanding production facilities (primarily in the North
America Segment, Germany and France), capitalization of
machines provided to our customers and for Care Coordina-
tion as well as capitalization of certain development costs.
Capital expenditures were approximately 6 % of total reve-
nue in 2019 (2018: 6 %).

Acquisitions during 2019 were primarily driven by the acqui-
sition of NxStage on February 21, 2019 (see Note 3 of the
notes to the consolidated financial statements included in
this report) as well as dialysis clinics.

In 2019, we received €60 M from divestitures. These divesti-
tures were mainly related to the divestment of MedSpring
Urgent Care Centers in Texas, sales of debt securities, the
divestment of a California-based cardiovascular business and
B.Braun Medical Inc.'s purchase of NxStage’s bloodlines busi-
ness in connection with our acquisition of NxStage.

Investments in 2018 were primarily driven by debt securities
and an equity investment in Humacyte within the North
America Segment. The remaining investments in the North
America Segment, the emea Segment and the Latin America
Segment were largely in acquisitions of dialysis clinics as well
as license agreements and distribution rights in the North
America Segment. In 2018, we received €1,683 M from
divestitures mainly related to the divestment of Sound on
June 28, 2018 (see NOTE 4 Cc) of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements), as well as the sale of debt securities in
the amount of €150 M.

In 2020 we anticipate capital expenditures of €1.1 to €1.3 BN
and expect to make acquisitions and investments, excluding

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

investments in debt securities, of approximately €0.5 to
€0.7 BN (see the chapter “Outlook” starting on PAGE 60).

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities

Net cash used in financing activities was €467 M in 2019
(2018: €682 M).

In 2019, cash was mainly used in the repayments of long-
term debt (including the current portion of long-term debt
primarily driven by the repayment of bonds due in July 2019),
repayments of short-term debt (including short-term debt
from related parties), repayment of lease liabilities, shares
repurchased as part of a share buyback program, payment of
dividends, and distributions to noncontrolling interests, par-
tially offset by proceeds from long-term debt (including the
issuance of bonds with a volume of €1,750 M and $500 M as
well as additional drawings under the revolving credit facili-
ties of the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement), proceeds from
short-term debt (including short-term debt from related par-
ties) and the utilization of the Accounts Receivable Facility.

In 2018, cash was mainly used in the repayments of long-
term debt including the repayment of Bonds due in Septem-
ber 2018, the payment of dividends, the complete repayment
of amounts drawn under the Accounts Receivable Facility,
distributions to noncontrolling interests and repayments of
short-term debt, partially offset by proceeds from short-term
debt (including drawings under the commercial paper pro-
gram), long-term debt through an issuance under the newly
established debt issuance program and short-term debt from
related parties.

On May 21, 2019, we paid a dividend of €1.17 per share for
2018 (€1.06 per share for 2017 paid in 2018). The total divi-
dend payment was €355 M in 2019 (2018: €325 M).

CHART 2.28 ON PAGE 57 summarizes our significant long-term

December 31, 2019.

For a description of our short-term debt including the com-
mercial paper program, SEE NOTE 13 of the notes to the con-
solidated financial statements. For a description of our long-
term sources of liquidity, including the Amended 2012 Credit
Agreement, bonds, equity-neutral convertible bonds and the
Accounts Receivable Facility, see NOTE 14 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements.

TABLE 2.29 ON PAGE 58 summarizes our available sources of
liquidity at December 31, 2019.

An additional source of liquidity is our commercial paper pro-
gram under which up to €1,000 M of short-term notes can
be issued on a flexible and continuous basis. As of December

‘Accounts Receivable Facility

31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we fully utilized the com-
mercial paper program.

The amount of guarantees and other commercial commit-
ments at December 31, 2019 was not significant.

At December 31, 2019, we had short-term debt (excluding
the current portion of long-term debt) and short-term debt
from related parties in the total amount of €1,172 M.

TABLE 2.30 ON PAGE 58 Summarizes our obligations and com-
mitments to make future payments under our long-term debt
and other long-term obligations, and our commitments and
obligations under lines of credit and letters of credit as of
December 31, 2019.

Our debt instruments, including the Amended 2012 Credit
Agreement, outstanding bonds and the Accounts Receivable
Facility contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

dispose of assets, incur additional debt, create liens or engage
in sale-leaseback transactions. However, these are subject to
a number of exceptions and qualifications or may be sus-
pended based on a ratings trigger. In addition, under our
Amended 2012 Credit Agreement and Accounts Receivable
Facility, we are obligated to not exceed a maximum consoli-
dated net leverage ratio as defined in these financing agree-
ments.

As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all
covenants under the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement and
our other financing agreements. For information regarding
our Amended 2012 Credit Agreement, bonds and the
Accounts Receivable Facility, see NOTE 14 of the notes to con-
solidated financial statements.

Although current and future economic conditions could
adversely affect our business and our profitability, we believe
that we are well positioned to continue to grow our business
while meeting our financial obligations as they come due.
Due to the non-discretionary nature of the health care ser-
vices we provide, the need for health care products utilized to
provide such services and the availability of government reim-
bursement for a substantial portion of our health care ser-
vices, our business is generally not cyclical. A substantial por-
tion of our accounts receivable is generated by governmental
payors. While payment and collection practices vary signifi-
cantly between countries and even between agencies within
one country, government payors usually represent low to
moderate, credit risks. However, limited or expensive access
to capital could make it more difficult for our customers to do
business with us, or to do business generally, which could
adversely affect our business by causing our customers to
reduce or delay their purchases of our health care products
(see “Results of operations” starting on PAGE 42). If the con-
ditions in the capital markets worsen, this could increase our
financing costs and limit our financial flexibility.

* Our pension liabilties are not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments. The regular or special funding of our pension plans may adversely affect our liquidity in the future periods. The
liability recognized in our consolidated financial statements may fluctuate significantly in future periods due to changes in assumptions, in particular to the discount rate, the rate of future compensation
increases and pension progression. Actual results could differ from assumptions due to changing market, economic and governmental regulatory conditions, thereby resulting in an increase or decrease of the
liability. Employer contributions expected to be paid to the defined benefit plans during fiscal year 2020 are €1 M. For additional information regarding our pension plans and expected payments for the next
ten years, SEE NOTE 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Further unconditional purchase agreements exist with an equity method investee of the Company. For further information on

these agreements, see NOTE 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

® Other long-term obligations consist mainly of production asset acquisition commitments

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

At our Annual General Meeting on May 19, 2020, our Gen-
eral Partner and our Supervisory Board will propose to the
shareholders a dividend of €1.20 per share for 2019, payable
in 2020 (for 2018 paid in 2019: €1.17). The total expected
dividend payment is approximately €358 M compared to divi-
dends of €355 M for 2018 paid in 2019.

Our principal financing needs in 2020 relate to repayments of
the equity-neutral convertible bonds due in January 2020,
which were refinanced via bonds in November 2019, and of
bonds due in October 2020, to the share buyback program as
well as amortizations under our Amended 2012 Credit Agree-
ment. These payments as well as our dividend payment in
May 2020, anticipated capital expenditures, and further
acquisition payments are expected to be covered by our cash
flow, using existing credit facilities and, if required, additional
debt financing. We currently have sufficient flexibility under
our debt covenants to meet our financing needs in the near
future. Generally, we believe that we will have sufficient
financing to achieve our goals in the future and to continue
to promote our growth.

NET ASSETS

Our total consolidated assets in the past fiscal year were
€32,935 M, an increase of €6,692 M (26 %) over the prior
year, including a positive foreign exchange impact of 2 %.

Non-current assets increased by €7,374M (40%) to
€25,770 M in 2019 and represented 78 % of total assets
(2018: 70 %). Besides a positive foreign exchange impact of
2 %, this increase was primarily a result of the recognition of
right-of-use assets due to the implementation of iFRs 16 in
2019 of €4,325 M. Additionally, the increase in goodwill and
intangible assets, which was mainly due to the acquisition of
NxStage in February 2019, contributed to the increase in
non-current assets.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

General information Outlook

Overview of the Group Risks and Opportunities Report

Economic Report Corporate Governance fundamentals

Subsequent events

Current assets decreased by 9% to €7,165M. This was
mainly the result of decreased cash and cash equivalents, pri-
marily in connection with the acquisition of NxStage, partially
offset by a positive foreign exchange impact of 1 %, higher
finished goods, trade accounts and other receivables as well
as increased other current assets.

On the liability side of the balance sheet, our total liabilities
were €19,708M at December 31, 2019, an increase of
€6,368 M (48 %) from €13,340 M in 2018. This increase was
primarily the result of the recognition of lease liabilities due to
the implementation of iFRs 16 in 2019 of €4,705 M, higher
short-term and long-term debt as well as pension liabilities.
Foreign exchange impact represented 1 % of the increase of
total liabilities.

Current liabilities account for €2,619M of our debt, an
increase of 118 M (5 %) from €2,501 M in the prior year. For-
eign exchange impact represented 1 % of this increase. Fur-
thermore, the increase of short-term debt was mainly a result
of the reclassification of u.s. dollar-denominated bonds, the
equity-neutral convertible bonds and an euro-denominated
term loan under the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement to the
current portion of long-term debt, as these will mature in
2020. The increase was partially offset by the repayment of
bonds denominated in u.s. dollar and euro at their maturity
in July 2019 and the decrease of short-term debt from related
parties.

Long-term debt increased to €6,458 M from €5,045 M in the
prior year, an increase of 1,413 M (28 %). Foreign exchange
impact represented 1 % of this increase. Furthermore, the
increase of long-term debt was mainly a result of the issuance
of bonds with a total volume of €1,750 M and $500 M, the
utilization of the Accounts Receivable Facility and additional
drawings under the revolving credit facilities of the Amended
2012 Credit Agreement. It was partially offset by the reclassi-

Or
Wo}

fication of u.s. dollar-denominated bonds, the equity-neutral
convertible bonds and an euro-denominated term loan under
the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement as well as the quarterly
repayments of the remaining term loans under the Amended
2012 Credit Agreement to the current portion of long-term
debt.

Shareholders’ equity increased by 3 % to €13,227 M. The
increase was driven by a positive foreign exchange impact of
2 %, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests gen-
erated for the year, the purchase/sale of noncontrolling inter-
ests and proceeds from exercised stock options. It was par-
tially offset by purchases of treasury stock as part of a share
buyback program, dividend payments, distributions to non-
controlling interests, the valuation of noncontrolling interests
subject to put options at fair value and changes in actuarial
(gains) losses from changes in assumptions for pension obli-
gations. The equity to assets ratio decreased to 40 % at
December 31, 2019 from 49 % at December 31, 2018, pri-
marily as a result of the recognition of right-of-use assets fol-
lowing the implementation of irRs 16 in 2019. Adjusted for
effect from the Implementation of iFRs 16, equity to assets
ratio was 47 % at December 31, 2019.

At Group level, Roic decreased to 6.1 % at December 31,
2019 from 12.4 % at December 31, 2018. Adjusted for the
Implementation of IFRs 16, ROIC was 6.8 % at December 31,
2019 (see reconciliation in chapter “Performance manage-
ment system” section “Return on invested capital” starting
on PAGE 27). The decrease was mainly due to the positive
effect from the gain related to divestitures of Care Coordina-
tion activities in the prior year. Goodwill, included in the item
invested capital, has a significant impact on the calculation
of the Roic. The weighted average cost of capital (wacc)
was 6.3 %.

MANAGEMENT'S GENERAL ASSESSMENT

2019 was a successful year for Fresenius Medical Care. We
achieved our revenue and net income targets and are there-
fore proposing our 23rd consecutive dividend increase. Last
year we also invested more strongly in our future growth,
particularly in the area of home dialysis and in developing
economies. In addition, our measures to increase efficiency
and optimize our cost base are progressing according to plan.
As a consequence, we expect growth to accelerate, and con-
firm the 2020 outlook that we issued early last year.

At the time this Management Report was prepared, the Man-
agement Board continued to assess the development of
Fresenius Medical Care as positive. Demand for our products
and services continue to grow steadily around the world.

OUTLOOK

The outlook describes how Fresenius Medical Care
expects to perform in fiscal year 2020. These
statements take into account all events known

at the time the, financial statements were prepared
which could affect the development of our
business in 2020.

BUSINESS POLICY

Fresenius Medical Care is the world’s leading dialysis com-
pany based on publicly reported revenue and the number of
patients treated. We aim to further expand this position in
the years ahead. As always, the basic principle of our corpo-
rate strategy is to fully capture the potential of being a verti-
cally integrated company. This means consistently making
use of the advantages that arise from covering the complete
value chain of dialysis. Fresenius Medical Care intends to
make steady progress in the provision of holistic care to dial-
ysis patients and dialysis-related treatments. In addition to
our products and dialysis treatment itself, we will continue to
offer additional services in the future, such as supplementary
medical services for the treatment of our patients in the area
of Care Coordination. We have no plans to make significant
changes to our business policy.

SECTOR-SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT —
DIALYSIS MARKET

The Company expects the number of dialysis patients world-
wide to grow by about 6 % in 2020. Some significant regional
differences are likely to remain: The Company anticipates an
increase in the u.s., Japan and Western and Central Europe of

60

less than 1 % to slightly above 3 %. The number of patients
with chronic kidney disease is already relatively high in these
countries and regions and patients generally have reliable
access to treatment, normally dialysis. In economically weaker
regions, the growth rates will be higher. We expect patient
numbers to continue growing in the coming years — SEE TABLE
2.31.

72.31 EXPECTED GROWTH IN PATIENT NUMBERS

Growth 2020
North America Segment ~3%
EMEA Segment ~4%
Asia-Pacific Segment ~8%
Latin America Segment ~3%
WORLDWIDE ~6%

Source: Internal estimates

Our growth strategy is based on an in-depth analysis of the
major trends affecting Fresenius Medical Care:

» Demographic factors: Demographic factors are one of the
main reasons for the continued growth of dialysis markets.
As average life expectancy rises worldwide, the share of
older people in the population is also growing. However,
kidney function deteriorates with age. Therefore, demo-
graphic change is an important indicator for the future
number of dialysis patients, which is expected to increase
from around 3.7 M worldwide in 2020 to about 4.9 M in
2025.
Increase in lifestyle diseases: Diseases such as high blood
pressure and diabetes are on the rise around the world.
They can cause damage to the entire organism and also
often impair kidney function in the long-term.
» Improved access to medical care: Thanks to ongoing efforts
to establish and expand balanced and sustainable health

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

care systems in many countries around the globe, a growing
number of patients are gaining access to suitable dialysis
treatments for the first time. We expect this trend to con-
tinue and drive demand for high-quality products and treat-
ments.

Changes in the health care industry: The health care indus-
try is constantly changing. We believe that demand for the
holistic care of chronic patients will continue to rise. In
future, the focus when treating kidney patients will no lon-
ger be simply on offering individual dialysis products or ser-
vices, but also on combining all fields of application related
to dialysis and coordinating them more effectively.

Hemodialysis will remain the treatment of choice, accounting
for about 89 % of all dialysis therapies. Peritoneal dialysis will
continue to be the preferred treatment for about 11 % of all
dialysis patients.

The volume of the worldwide dialysis market, which
amounted to about €80 BN last year according to preliminary
estimates, is expected to increase by around 4 % per year.
This is based on the assumption that exchange rates will
remain stable in the forecasting period. The overall volume of
the dialysis market could thus reach around €83 BN by 2020.

In addition, the reimbursement and ancillary services utiliza-
tion environment significantly influences our business. In the
u.s., our biggest sales market, the reimbursements of govern-
mental institutions are lower than the reimbursements of pri-
vate insurers. Therefore, a change in the portion of reim-
bursements by private insurers in the u.s. influences our
business.

Economic Report Corporate Governance fundamentals

Subsequent events

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS
PERFORMANCE IN 2020

Fresenius Medical Care’s outlook for 2020 is at Constant
Exchange Rates. Outlook 2020 is excluding special items.
Special items are effects that are unusual in nature and have
not been foreseeable or not foreseeable in size or impact at
the time of giving guidance. The growth rates are based on
the results in 2019 adjusted for Cost Optimization Costs, the
(gain) loss related to divestitures of Care Coordination activi-
ties and NxStage costs. For a reconciliation of the results
2019 to the results 2019 adjusted as a basis for the targets
2020, SEE TABLE 2.33 ON PAGE 62.

REVENUE

We aim revenue to incease at a mid to high single digit
growth rate at Constant Exchange Rates in 2020.

RESULT OF OPERATIONS
Operating income

We expect operating income and Delivered Operating Income
to develop at a mid to high single digit growth rate at Con-
stant Exchange Rates in 2020. This growth for 2020 is based
on operating income and Delivered Operating Income in
2019 adjusted for Cost Optimization Costs, the (gain) loss
related to divestitures of Care Coordination activities and
NxStage costs.

Net income
We aim to achieve a development in net income (net income

attributable to shareholders of FMc AG & CO. KGAA) at a mid
to high single digit growth rate at Constant Exchange Rates

61

as well in 2020. This growth rate is based on net income in
2019 adjusted for Cost Optimization Costs, the (gain) loss
related to divestitures of Care Coordination activities and
NxStage costs.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share are expected to develop in the same
way as net income in 2020 compared to 2019 assessed based
on the expected development of net income and shares out-
standing.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ACQUISITIONS
AND INVESTMENTS

In 2020, we intend to spend around €1.6 BN to €2.0 BN on
capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments (excluding
investments in debt securities). Capital expenditures should
account for €1.1 BN to €1.3 BN. Around 40 % of this amount
is earmarked for expansion investments. €0.5 BN to €0.7 BN
is to be used for mainly bolt-on acquisitions and equity invest-
ments in health care.

Capital expenditures will primarily be used to expand our pro-
duction capacities and rationalize production processes, to
equip new dialysis clinics and distributors as well as for main-
tenance.

LIQUIDITY
Cash flow

In 2020, net cash provided by operating activities in percent
of revenue is expected to account for more than 12.5 %.

In 2020, free cash flow in percent of revenue is expected to
account for more than 5 %.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

Net leverage ratio

Fresenius Medical Care uses the net leverage ratio as a guide-
line in its long-term financial planning. The ratio was 3.2 at
the end of 2019. The target figure is expected to be better
than 3.5 at the end of 2020.

Profitability

We expect RoIc to be at least 6.0 % in 2020 compared to
6.1 % in 2019.

DIVIDEND

Fresenius Medical Care intends to continue its profit-oriented
dividend policy in principle. Information on the proposed div-
idend increase can be found in the “Net cash provided by
(used in) financing activities” section in chapter “Economic
report” starting On PAGE 36.

NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Employees

Due to the anticipated expansion of our business, we expect
the number of employees to grow in all regions in 2020,
particularly in the area of health care. By the end of 2020, the
number of employees working for Fresenius Medical Care
is estimated to increase to more than 124,000 (full-time
equivalents).

Research and development
We aim to spend €210 M to €230 M on research and develop-

ment in 2020. The number of personnel concerned (currently
1,157 full-time equivalents) should not change significantly.

RISKS AND
OPPORTUNITIES
REPORT

As a company with global operations, Fresenius
Vedical Care is naturally exposed to risks in
connection with its business activities. Ultimately,
we can leverage opportunities for our business onl)
if we are willing to take certain risks. Thanks to
our many years of experience and our extensive
knowledg of the markets, we are able to identi y
and assess risks and opportunities for our business.

RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES
MANAGEMENT

We see risk management as the ongoing task of determining,
analyzing and evaluating the spectrum of actual and poten-
tial risks arising from our business operations in our environ-
ment, and, where possible, taking pre-emptive and corrective
measures. The risk management system provides us with a
basis for these activities. It enables management to identify
risks that could jeopardize the Company's growth or going
concern, and to take steps to minimize any negative impact.
As such, it is an important component of Fresenius Medical
Care’s management and governance.

In addition, the Company ensures its long-term success by
actively managing opportunities. The aim here is to identify
and assess opportunities as early as possible, and initiate
appropriate measures so that opportunities can be turned
into business success for Fresenius Medical Care. Long-term
and medium-term opportunities are taken into account in our

63

strategy and budget planning. Short-term opportunities are
seized as part of ongoing business operations, provided this
is meaningful and in line with business targets.

RISK MANAGEMENT
RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The main objective of the risk management system is to iden-
tify potential risks as early as possible to assess their impact
on the business activities and, where necessary, to take
appropriate countermeasures. Due to constantly changing
external as well as internal requirements and conditions, risk
management at Fresenius Medical Care is continuously evolv-
ing. In the past financial year, the Company's risk manage-
ment approach was strengthened regarding the complete-
ness and validity of risk information by the implementation of
risk committees on regional, functional and corporate level.

The structure of the internal risk management system is
based on the internationally recognized framework for com-
pany-wide risk management, the “Enterprise Risk Manage-
ment - Integrated Framework" of the Committee of Sponsor-
ing Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“coso”).
Opportunities are not covered by the implemented risk man-
agement system.

As part of the risk management system, regional risk coordi-
nators assume the task of coordinating risk management
activities within the regions and selected functions with the
help of risk management software. These activities relate to
existing and potential emerging short-term as well as medi-
um-term risks. Semiannually, identified risk information is
processed by the risk coordinators and discussed in
regional/functional risk committees. Subsequently the cen-
tral risk management function gathers the risks from regions

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

and functions, analyses and discusses them in the corporate
risk committee and communicates the compiled results to the
executive management board. The focus during this process
is on significant risks, which are above a defined threshold.

The Management Board and central risk management are
promptly informed of new risks that are estimated to be high
or develop into high risks in order to ensure appropriate
responses. The effectiveness of the risk management system
is monitored by the Audit and Corporate Governance Com-
mittee of the Supervisory Board.

The organizational structure of risk management at Fresenius
Medical Care as well as the previously described processes are
shown in CHART 2.34 ON PAGE 64.

In addition to risk reporting, standard reporting to manage-
ment is an important tool for managing and controlling risks,
as well as for taking preventive measures in a timely manner.
Therefore, the Management Board of the Company is
informed on a monthly basis about the industry situation, the
Company‘s operating and non-operating business, and the
outcome of analyses of the Company's earnings and financial
position, as well as of the assets position on a quarterly basis.

The Global Internal Audit department is regularly informed
about the results of the risk management system. This depart-
ment determines risk focus areas and audits a selected num-
ber of Company departments, subsidiaries and IT applications
worldwide each year. Determined risk focus areas are audited
across all business segments. The department works accord-
ing to the internationally accepted standards of the Institute
of Internal Auditors (“11a”), which was confirmed by a quality
assessment in 2017. The scope of internal auditing is wide-
spread and involves, among other activities, periodic assess-
ment of the effectiveness of controls (including legal compli-
ance controls) over business processes, IT security, the

Subsequent events

reliability of financial reporting and compliance with account-
ing regulations and internal policies. The Company's locations
and units to be audited are determined annually on the basis
of a selection model taking various risks into consideration.
This annual audit plan is reviewed and approved by the Man-
agement Board and the Audit and Corporate Governance
Committee of the Supervisory Board. All audit reports with
material observations are presented to the Management
Board. The Global Internal Audit department is also responsi-
ble for monitoring the implementation of measures mitigat-
ing identified deficiencies. The Management Board is
informed about the mitigation status on a quarterly basis.
The Audit and Corporate Governance Committee of the
Supervisory Board is also informed of the audit results. In
2019, a total of 45 audits were carried out.

64

Nevertheless, it is important to note that even a functioning
and adequate risk management system like the Company's
cannot guarantee that all risks are fully identified and con-
trolled.

INTERNAL CONTROL AND
RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR
THE GROUP’S ACCOUNTING PROCESS

The Company’s internal control system over financial report-
ing ensures compliance with applicable accounting stan-
dards. The goal is to provide reasonable assurance that the
Group financial statements are issued in accordance with
appropriate accounting principles. The Company's internal
reporting process is generally carried out at four levels and

ensures that financial data and key figures are reliably
recorded, processed and controlled. At each of these four
reporting levels — the local entity, the region, the segment and
the entire Group — the figures and data are compared regu-
larly on a monthly and quarterly basis with the previous year's
values, budget targets, and the latest projections. In addition,
the Management Board and the departments responsible for
preparing the annual and consolidated Group financial state-
ments discuss all parameters, assumptions and estimates that
substantially affect the Group and segment results reported
externally. The Audit and Corporate Governance Committee
of the Supervisory Board also reviews current quarterly results
and compares them with budgets and projections.

The internal control system contains guidelines and instruc-
tions that ensure that all Company transactions are recorded
appropriately and presented accurately.

Further control mechanisms to ensure reliable financial
reporting and correct recording of transactions within the
accounting and the consolidation process include automated
and manual reconciliations, as well as the separation of cer-
tain personnel functions to prevent potential conflicts of
interest. The fact that all process owners assess the risks of
their respective processes in terms of their implications for
accounting also ensures that risks with a direct impact on
financial reporting are identified and that controls are in place
to minimize these risks. Changes to accounting standards are
discussed on an ongoing basis and considered in the prepara-
tion of the financial statements. Employees responsible for
financial reporting are given regular training to be up to date
with changes regarding accounting standards. The consolida-
tion is performed centrally by the department which is
responsible for the group accounting. The basis for the con-
solidation is derived from reporting packages and sub-group
consolidated financial statements prepared and submitted by
the local group entities. The preparation of the reporting

Economic Report Corporate Governance fundamentals

Subsequent events

packages and the sub-group consolidated financial state-
ments is performed according to central requirements and
guidelines.

As the Company is also listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, it is required to adhere to the requirements of the
u.s. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“sox”). Section 404 of this federal
law stipulates that the management boards of companies
listed in the u.s. must take responsibility for implementing
and adhering to an appropriate internal control system to
produce reliable financial reporting. Based on this require-
ment, the design and operating effectiveness of the internal
control system over financial reporting are routinely tested
and considered in regular internal audits. These criteria are
also included in the review by the Company’s independent
auditors.

The internal control system over financial reporting follows
the criteria of the coso model. This was developed by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“coso”) of the
Treadway Commission and is recognized as a standard by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“sec”). In accordance
with the coso model, the internal control system over finan-
cial reporting is divided into the five components: control
environment, risk assessment, control activities, information
and communication, as well as the monitoring of the internal
control system. Each of these components is regularly docu-
mented, tested and assessed. The Company aligned its inter-
nal controls to fulfil the requirements of the coso model.

The Company's review of the internal control system over
financial reporting complies with a specific sec guideline
(Guidance Regarding Management's Report on Internal Con-
trol Over Financial Reporting) and is conducted with software
support. In a first step, regional project teams coordinate the
assessment of the internal control system in each region,
after which the results are consolidated for the whole Group.

Based on this, management then evaluates the effectiveness
of the internal control system for the current fiscal year. Exter-
nal advisers are consulted as needed. A corporate steering
committee meets several times a year to review changes and
new requirements of sox, to discuss possible control deficien-
cies, and derive further measures. In addition, in its meetings,
the Audit and Corporate Governance Committee of the
Supervisory Board is informed regularly of the results of man-
agement's assessment.

As of December 31, 2019, management assessed the Com-
pany’s internal control system over financial reporting and
determined a control deficiency representing a material
weakness. The material weakness relates to the design and
operating effectiveness of internal controls for revenue rec-
ognition, specifically for estimating the transaction price and
constraining the variable consideration of the transaction
price for certain fee-for-service revenue arrangements under
legal consideration and timely adjusting the constraint of
variable consideration when new information arises. This
control deficiency did not result in a material misstatement of
the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclo-
sures for any periods through and including the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2019. However, this control deficiency
could have resulted in a material misstatement to our annual
or interim consolidated financial statements that would not
be prevented or detected. Accordingly, the Company has
determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material
weakness.

Internal control systems over financial reporting are subject to
inherent limitations, no matter how carefully they are
designed. As a result, there is no absolute assurance that
financial reporting objectives can be met, nor that misstate-
ments will always be prevented or detected.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

RISKS

The following section describes significant risks which could
have an impact on our business operations. In the course of
the risk assessment an estimation of the risks takes place
regarding the likelihood of occurrence and the potential
impact in the respective assessment period, allowing a priori-
tization of the risks into the classifications “low” “medium”
and “high”. Besides quantitative factors, especially qualita-
tive factors are applied. For the identification of strategic
developments, besides the short-term consideration (one
year), risks can also be assessed in terms of a medium-term
impact within the subsequent five years.

The scales for classification of potential impact and likelihood
as well as the localization of the risks within the risk matrix
are depicted in CHART 2.35 ON PAGE 66.

The risk areas in CHART 2.35 ON PAGE 66 as Well as measures
for mitigating the impact or the probability of occurrence of
risks within these areas are described in the following section.

Sector-specific risks
Regulatory environment, product quality

The Company's operations in both its health care services
business and products business are subject to extensive gov-
ernmental regulation in virtually every country in which the
Company operates. The Company is also subject to other
laws of general applicability, including anti-trust laws. The
applicable regulations, which differ from country to country,
cover areas that include:

cal products and supplies;

audits and reviews by enforcement authorities, including
the Food and Drug Administration ("Fba”), for compliance

the collection, dissemination, access, use, security and pri-
vacy of protected health information and other protected
data;

compliance with due diligence, warranty obligations and

compensation of medical directors and other financial
arrangements with physicians and other referral sources.

In addition to the risks from non-compliance with the regula-
tory environment, as a manufacturing company we face the
risk that products, as a result of unsuitable product designs or
issues in the production process, do not fulfill our standards
of quality and could lead to the possibility of not achieving
expected treatment results which may result in product recalls
that might lead to significant adverse financial results or rep-
utational damage.

If the Company fails to comply with one or more of these
laws or regulations or incurs a quality incident, this may give
rise to a number of adverse legal and financial consequences.
These include, in particular, loss or suspension of governmen-

tal certifications, loss or suspension of licenses under the laws
of governmental authority from which we generate substan-
tial revenues, monetary and administrative penalties, recall
actions and claims for damages, increased costs for compli-
ance with government orders, complete or partial exclusion
from government reimbursement programs, refunds of pay-
ments received from government payors and government
health care program beneficiaries due to any failures to meet
applicable requirements or complete or partial curtailment of
the Company's authority to conduct business. In the end,
these types of risks could no longer be insured. Including the
considerable costs of legal defense, all the consequences
mentioned above could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, results of operations and financial con-
dition.

A number of the health care businesses in the u.s., that the
Company operates is owned, or managed, by joint ventures
in which one or more hospitals, physicians or physician prac-
tice groups hold an interest. While the Company has struc-
tured its joint venture arrangements with physicians to com-
ply with many of the criteria for safe harbor protection under
the federal and state Anti-Kickback Statutes, its investments
in these joint venture arrangements do not satisfy all ele-
ments of such safe harbor. If one or more of its joint ventures
were found to be in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute or
the Stark Law, the Company could be required to restructure
or terminate them. The Company also could be required to
repay to Medicare, Medicaid as well as other federal health
care amounts pursuant to any prohibited referrals, and the
Company could be subject to monetary penalties and exclu-
sion from federal and state health care programs. Imposition
of any of these penalties could have a material adverse impact
on its business, results of operations and financial condition.

Compliance programs implemented in the regions reduce the
risk of legal violations by providing general and specific rules

67

of conduct and procedures as well as regular training of the
employees according to the specifications. To ensure that our
products and services comply with the quality requirements,
we implemented quality management systems in the differ-
ent regions. The employees have access to procedures and
work instructions to ensure that the applicable quality
requirements are met. In addition, we conduct internal
reviews of the production sites and clinics to monitor compli-
ance with quality standards of our products and services. Fur-
thermore, our plants and hospitals are also subject to external
reviews by the relevant supervisory authorities.

U.S. federal health care programs

As stated in the report in section “Macroeconomic and sec-
tor-specific environment” of chapter “Economic Report”
starting on PAGE 36, our dialysis clinics in the us participate in
the Quality Incentive Program (“air”) within the End-Stage
Renal Disease (“EsRD") prospective payment system (“Pps”).
Payment reductions of up to 2 % of Medicare reimburse-
ments based on previous year's performance can be made if
the quality standards of the qip are not met in the clinics.
Should Fresenius Medical Care fail to meet the aip’s minimum
requirements to a greater extent, this could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Through our value-based agreements and shared risk prod-
ucts, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative
costs for certain patients in return for fixed periodic payments
from governmental and commercial insurers. The Company
currently participates in the “Comprehensive esrb Care initia-
tive” of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(“cms”) as well as remuneration agreements with insurers
under which the Company receives a fixed remuneration to
cover all, or a defined amount of treatment costs, for a
defined quantity of patients (Details and detailed descriptions

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

of the above mentioned and other programs in which the
Company participates can be found in the report in section
“Macroeconomic and sector-specific environment” of chap-
ter “Economic Report” starting on PAGE 36).

Under cms’s Comprehensive esrp Care Model, dialysis provid-
ers and physicians can form entities known as EsRD Seamless
Care Organizations (“escos"). Escos that achieve the pro-
gram’‘s minimum quality thresholds and generate reductions
in cms's cost of care above certain thresholds for the esrD
patients covered by the esco will receive a share of the cost
savings. However, Escos that include dialysis chains with more
than 200 facilities are required to share in the risk of cost
increases and reimburse cms a share of any such increases.

The profitability in our value-based agreements and shared
risk products is dependent in part upon our ability to manage
a patient's care, to collaborate with our payer partners, to
coordinate with other health care providers and to find cost
efficient, medically appropriate sites of service for our
patients. Any failure to do so would limit our ability to
improve the quality of patient care and health outcomes and
to reduce medically unnecessary costs, which could lead to
poorer performance under value-based payment arrange-
ments.

The reserves that we establish in connection with the opera-
tion of our value-based arrangements and shared risk prod-
ucts as well as estimations of the amount of revenues from
health care services that we recognize in a reporting period
are based upon assumptions and judgments concerning a
number of factors which are subject to uncertainties. Those
factors include trends in health care costs, expenses, the
complicated billing and collection process, complex and
changing laws and regulations subject to interpretation,
determination of primary and secondary coverage and other
factors. Additionally, collections, refunds and payor retrac-

tions may continue to occur for up to three years or longer
after services are provided. To the extent the actual claims
experience is less favorable than estimated based on our
underlying assumptions, the timing and amount of our rec-
ognition of revenues as well as future earnings could be
adversely affected or incurred losses could increase.

Although efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act (“aca”)
have been unsuccessful, further efforts to repeal or revise the
Aca the posture of cms in the current administration toward
projects of this sort and litigation seeking the termination of
the aca may affect the project's future prospects in ways we
currently cannot quantify or predict. In addition, while we
have applied for participation in cms’ Comprehensive Kidney
Care Contracting (“ckcc”) model, we do not yet know
whether or to what extent our applications will be accepted,
whether the terms of such model will be developed by cms in
a manner acceptable to warrant our continued participation,
and whether, if we do decide to participate, we and our part-
ners will be able to deliver better health outcomes while low-
ering cms’ costs.

We cannot give any assurance that we will achieve the cost
savings required or contemplated by these programs, which
could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
In addition, we may experience higher write-offs of Medicare
deductibles and other amounts due to uninsured and under-
insured patients, resulting in an increase in uncollectible
accounts.

The Company mitigated the impact of the Esp pes and the
other legislative initiatives referenced above with two broad
measures. First, it works with medical directors and treating
physicians to make clinical protocol changes used in treating
patients consistent with the qip and good clinical practices,
and it negotiates pharmaceutical acquisition cost savings. In
addition, the Company achieved greater efficiencies and bet-

68

ter patient outcomes by introducing new initiatives to improve
patient care upon initiation of dialysis, increase the percent-
age of patients using home therapies and achieve additional
cost reductions in its clinics.

Composition of our customer base

Our health care product business and our dialysis services
business differ across the regions in which we operate. In
many cases, our products and services are paid, either directly
or indirectly, by government institutions. We believe the risk
of default from a government payor is generally low to mod-
erate worldwide. On a country level, the payor base is char-
acterized by distinct customer or payor groups which can
range in volume from a few customers to a considerable
amount of customer types which have varying levels of risk
associated with default or non-payment of receivables as well
as risks for dependencies based upon the competition within
low volume customer base environments. In certain cases, a
resulting dependency on the payment behavior and deci-
sion-making of our business partners can affect the collect-
ability of accounts receivable and can adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company's measures aim to mitigate these risks by
actively negotiating long-term contracts with major custom-
ers, targeted marketing activities, developing new product
and pricing models as well as improving the quality of our
services and products.

Reimbursement by private insurers

In the u.s. a portion of the dialysis treatments is reimbursed
by private insurers and integrated care organizations; these
reimbursements are in general higher than the reimburse-
ments of the public health care systems. As a result, the pay-
ments we receive from private payors contribute a substantial

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

portion of our profit. In 2019, approximately 34 % of our
consolidated Health Care revenues were attributable to pri-
vate payors in the North America Segment. If these payors
succeed in lowering reimbursement rates in the usa, change
the extent or conditions of their networks or if the portion of
reimbursements by private insurers in general drops, this
could result in a significant reduction in Company revenue
and operating profit. In addition, the health care insurance
industry is experiencing continuing consolidation among
insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, including increas-
ing buyer power and impacts on referral streams. This may
have an adverse impact on our ability to negotiate favorable
coverage terms and commercially reasonable rates with such
insurers.

We monitor the relationships with private health insurance
companies continuously and try to hedge the business
through long-term contracts to maintain profitability.

A portion of our patients who are currently covered by private
insurers may be unable to continue to pay the premiums and
may become uninsured for dialysis services or elect to transi-
tion to government funded reimbursement programs that
reimburse us at lower rates for our services if efforts to restrict
or eliminate the charitable funding of patient insurance pre-
miums are successful.

Health care reforms

A number of governments have been considering proposals
to modify their current health care systems to improve quality
of and access to health care and to control costs. Policymak-
ers in several countries are also considering reforms that
could change the methodology used to reimburse providers
of health care services. Furthermore, standards and regula-
tions compulsory for providing dialysis service can be subject
to extensive changes.

Overview of the Group Risks and Opportunities Report

Economic Report Corporate Governance fundamentals

Subsequent events

In fiscal year 2019, the Company derived approximately 33 %
of its worldwide revenue from Medicare and Medicaid reim-
bursements in the u.s. Consequently, changes in legislation
or reimbursement practices regarding e.g. the End-Stage
Renal Disease Prospective Payment System (“esRD pps"), the
Physician Fee Schedule, the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule,
and the Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment System could
influence the volume of Medicare and Medicaid reimburse-
ments for services provided and the insurance coverage.

A decrease in reimbursement rates, covered services or
changes to standards, regulations or state funding in coun-
tries in which the Group operates, especially significant
changes in the u.s. Medicare and Medicaid programs could
reduce the Company's revenue and profitability and have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition
and results of operations.

In this context it might happen that the annually adjusted
ESRD PPS rates may not provide fully compensating reimburse-
ment for the services or products consumed during service.
This especially refers to the reimbursement of pharmaceuti-
cals depending on their status as outside of or as part of the
bundled rate. Pharmaceuticals included within the bundled
rate are subjected to increased reimbursement pressure. If we
are unable to secure appropriate reimbursement arrange-
ments for the pharmaceuticals we provide in our dialysis clin-
ics, we could experience a material adverse effect on our
operating results. Further, an increased utilization of bundled
pharmaceuticals or decreases in reimbursement for pharma-
ceuticals outside the bundled rate may result in a material
adverse impact on our results of operations.

The u.s. administration has publicly announced its intention
to pursue significant changes to existing health care insur-
ance programs, especially programs in connection with the
Affordable Care Act, although the administration has recently

stated that any efforts on its part to do so are likely to be
deferred after the 2020 elections in the u.s. In addition,
options to restructure the Medicare program in the direction
of a defined-contribution, “premium support” model and to
shift Medicaid funding to a block grant or per capita arrange-
ment, with greater flexibility for the states, are also being
considered.

In October of 2017, the u.s. administration discontinued
making cost-sharing reduction (“csr”) reimbursements to
insurers, arguing that Congress had failed to appropriate
funding for them. In response, many state departments of
Insurance (“bois”) either allowed or required insurers to mit-
igate their losses by increasing the 2018 premiums on their
ACA plans. Many insurers also mitigated the impact to con-
sumers by “silver loading”, a practice whereby the full pre-
mium increase attributable to the loss of csr payments is
applied to their silver-level plans. Silver loading mitigated the
impact of premium increases to consumers. In 2019 and
2020, all states either permit or required silver loading. It is
not predictable, how the ongoing litigation might be deter-
mined. As a result, a reduction in the availability of insurance
through such exchanges could reduce the number of our
commercially insured patients and shift such patients to
Medicare and Medicaid.

Changes of this nature could have significant effects on our
businesses, both positive and negative, but the outcomes are
impossible to predict.

Risks relating to the Company's business

Growth

The health care industry experiences continuing consolida-

tion particularly among health care providers. This develop-
ment could adversely affect our ability to find suitable acqui-

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

sition targets and to increase future growth and product
sales. Additionally, our ability to make future acquisitions as
well as develop our core dialysis business, in part, on the
availability of financial resources and the current restrictions
imposed by competition laws as well as existing credit agree-
ments. The integration of acquired businesses may cause
problems, e.g. by assuming unknown liabilities, underperfor-
mance subsequent to integration, associated requirements
from competition authorities or non-compliant business prac-
tices not disclosed by the seller or not uncovered during due
diligence. We also compete with other health care companies
in seeking suitable acquisition targets and developing our
core dialysis business. Any or all of these factors generally
could have a material adverse effect on our future growth,
including growth of our product sales.

Competitors

The Company faces numerous competitors in both its health
care services business and dialysis products business, some of
which may possess substantial financial, marketing or
research and development resources. Competition from new
and existing competitors and especially new competitive
developments such as increasing disruption in the health care
industry as well as innovations in technology and care deliv-
ery models could materially adversely affect the future pricing
and sale of our products and services.

In particular, technological innovation has historically been a
significant competitive factor in the dialysis products busi-
ness. The introduction of new products or services by com-
petitors could render one or more of the Company's products
or services less competitive or even obsolete, which could
also affect the Company’s sales and distribution of pharma-
ceuticals for which, to some extent, the Company is obli-
gated to make certain minimum annual royalty payments.

Economic Report Corporate Governance fundamentals

Subsequent events

To ensure our permanent competitiveness, we work closely
together with physicians and scientists. Important technolog-
ical and pharmaceutical innovations are intended to be
quickly identified and further developed, if necessary also by
adapting our business strategy. Moreover, we secure our
competitiveness by ongoing analyzes of our market environ-
ment as well as the regulatory framework. The market activ-
ity, especially our competitors’ products and newly launched
dialysis-related products are thoroughly monitored. The coop-
eration between the various technical, medical and academic
institutions within our company also ensures our competitive-
ness, which is finally further enhanced by our consequent
conduction of programs devoted to cost saving and efficiency
increase.

Research and development

The development of new products and therapies proposes a
risk that the desired development goal will not be achieved or
achieved significantly later than planned. Costly and exten-
sive preclinical and clinical examinations are necessary until
admission. All products, packaging, applications and technol-
ogies are constantly and systematically monitored, tested and
improved. We address potential risks in the area of research
and development (“rep”) by continually analyzing, evaluat-
ing and assessing whether the rep projects fit into the overall
strategy of Fresenius Medical Care. As a vertically integrated
company, we also benefit from direct contact with our
patients and medical professionals. Due to this close proxim-
ity to the market, we have the potential to gather important
information to develop and offer products and therapies that
meet the needs of our customers.

Referral practices

In providing services within our health care business, we
depend upon patients choosing our health care facilities as

70

the location for their care. Patients may select a facility based,
in whole or in part, on the recommendation of their physi-
cian. Physicians and other clinicians typically consider a num-
ber of factors when recommending a particular dialysis facil-
ity, pharmacy, physician practice, vascular surgery center or
urgent care center to an EsrD patient, including, the quality of
care, the competency of staff, convenient scheduling, loca-
tion and physical condition. Physicians may change their rec-
ommendations, which may result in the movement of new or
existing patients to competing facilities, including facilities
established by the physicians themselves. At most of our dial-
ysis clinics, a relatively small number of physicians often
account for the referral of all or a significant portion of the
patient base. We have no ability to control these recommen-
dations and referrals. If a significant number of physicians or
other referral sources cease referring their patients to our
facilities or stop purchasing or prescribing our dialysis prod-
ucts, this would reduce our health care revenue and could
materially adversely affect our overall operations.

Patents

One of the typical patent risks faced by the Company is inad-
equate protection in the form of patents for technologies and
products developed by the Company. This means that com-
petitors could copy the Company's products without incurring
comparable development costs. In addition, the Company
could infringe the patent of a competitor and thus be liable
for damages; this could result in a ban on the Company fur-
ther selling the affected product. An inadequate protection of
the Company's patents could have an adverse impact on the
Company's financial condition and results of operations.

Procurement

The Company's business is dependent on the reliable supply
of several raw materials for production and service purposes.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

If the Company is unable to counteract the risk of bottleneck
situations at times of limited availability of goods and other
materials in spite of our purchasing strategy in combination
with ongoing monitoring of market developments, this could
result in delays in production and hence have an adverse
effect on the Company's results of operations. Similarly, price
increases by suppliers and the inability to access new prod-
ucts or technology could also adversely affect the Company's
results of operations.

Our purchasing strategy is aimed at developing partnerships
with strategic suppliers through long-term contracts and at
the same time ensuring, where reasonably practicable, that
we have at least two sources for all supply and price-critical
primary products (dual sourcing, multiple sourcing). To pre-
vent loss of suppliers, we monitor our supplier relationships
on a regular basis. Suppliers which are integral to our pro-
curement functions are also subject to performance and risk
analyses as well as continuous supply chain monitoring.
Through constant market analyses, a demands-based design
of supplier-relationships and -contracts, as well as the use of
financial instruments, we seek to mitigate disruptive goods
shortages and potential price increases and to provide access
to new product and technology developments.

Personnel

The Company's continued growth in the health care business
will depend upon the ability to attract and retain skilled work-
force, including highly skilled nurses and other medical per-
sonnel. Competition for those employees is intense and
shortages for these sought-after employees, such as nurses,
or skilled engineers and research and development person-
nel, may increase the Company’s personnel and recruiting
costs and/or impair our reputation for production of techno-
logically advanced products. Moreover, the Company consid-
ers that future success in the provider business depends on


--- Page 54 ---

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT

General information Outlook

Overview of the Group Risks and Opportunities Report

Economic Report Corporate Governance fundamentals

Subsequent events

the ability to attract and retain qualified physicians to serve as
employees of or consultants to the Company's health care
services businesses. The Company's health care products
business depends on the development of new products, tech-
nologies and treatment concepts to be competitive. Addi-
tionally, in recruiting, employing and retaining personnel we
may be exposed to increasing risks relating to various labor
and staffing laws, legislative, union or other labor-related
activities or changes. Further, these factors could impact the
integration of acquired companies into our operations, which
could increase our costs, decrease our productivity and pre-
vent us from realizing synergies from acquisitions. If we are
unable to manage the risks mentioned, then our growth and
results of operations could be adversely impacted.

Corruption and fraud

The Company operates many facilities and engages with
other business associates to help it carry out its health care
activities. In such a decentralized system, it is difficult to
maintain the desired level of oversight and control over the
thousands of persons employed by many affiliated companies
and its business associates. Training, oversight and compli-
ance programs cannot assure protection from deliberate,
reckless or inadvertent acts of employees that violate the
Company’s compliance policies or anti-corruption laws. Such
violations could disrupt the Company's business and result in
a material adverse effect on results of operations or financial
condition.

Beginning in 2012, the Company received certain communi-
cations alleging conduct in countries outside the United
States that might violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(“FcpA”) or other anti-bribery laws. The Company conducted
investigations with the assistance of outside counsel and, in a
continuing dialogue, advised the sec and the United States
Department of Justice (“Do)”) about these investigations. The

71

DoJ and the sec also conducted their own investigations, in
which the Company cooperated.

In the course of this dialogue, the Company identified and
reported to the po) and the sec, and took remedial actions
with respect to, conduct that resulted in the po) and the sec
seeking monetary penalties including disgorgement of profits
and other remedies. This conduct revolved principally around
the Company's products business in countries outside the u.s.

In 2015, the Company self-reported to the German prosecu-
tor conduct with a potential nexus to Germany and continues
to cooperate with government authorities in Germany in
their review of the conduct that prompted the Company's
and government investigations.

Since 2012, the Company has made and continues to make
further significant investments in its compliance and financial
controls and in its compliance, legal and financial organiza-
tions. The Company's remedial actions included separation
from those employees responsible for the above-mentioned
conduct. The Company is dealing with post-FcPa review mat-
ters on various levels. The Company continues to be fully
committed to compliance with the Fcra and other applicable
anti-bribery laws.

Further information on these investigations can be found in
NOTE 22 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Information systems and business processes

As the Company continues to grow and introduces more
international operations, the processes within the Company
are increasingly complex. Accordingly, it is more and more
dependent on information and communication technologies
and -systems to structure its processes and harmonize them
between different regions. An insufficient design of those

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

systems and business processes as well as insufficient
resources could lead to non-availability of certain informa-
tion, causing inefficient workflows, deficient internal and
external communication and intransparencies regarding
operations. A breakdown of these systems could temporarily
lead to standstill of parts of our business and consequently
cause heavy damages. As of December 31, 2019, manage-
ment assessed the Company's internal control system over
financial reporting and determined a control deficiency repre-
senting a material weakness. For details, reference is made to
the section “Internal control and risk management system for
the Group's accounting process” in the “Risks and Opportu-
nities Report”, starting on PAGE 64.

Additionally, cyber-attacks or privacy and data breaches
regarding both our internal systems as well as systems of
third-party service providers could result in the misappropria-
tion or compromise of sensitive information. We gather and
handle personal information of our patients in many regions
of the world and thus need to adhere to various data protec-
tion and privacy regulations. Any loss, impermissible use,
access or disclosure of this sensitive information or non-com-
pliance with data protection and privacy related laws, regula-
tions and standards could threat our position in competition,
our reputation as well as our whole business.

Using its Information Security Management System (“isms"),
which is based on the internationally recognized security
standard Iso 27002, the security guidelines and processes
within the Company are enhanced continuously. Business
data is backed up regularly and disaster recovery plans, which
are regularly tested and improved, are in place. The Company
operates three data centers at geographically separate loca-
tions to maximize the availability and data security of IT sys-
tems. A mirrored infrastructure that creates a copy of critical
systems is in use. In general, we continue to enhance our


--- Page 55 ---

Subsequent events

internal information and reporting systems to ensure that
their structure meets evolving needs.

Furthermore, among others, company guidelines relating to
data protection and privacy, which also regulate the assign-
ment of access rights and third-party collaboration, must be
considered, trainings for employees are conducted and gov-
ernance structures are continuously adapted. Compliance is
monitored with controls including those relating to Section
404 of sox. Operational and security audits are carried out
every year both internally and by external auditors. The exist-
ing IT security architecture with different layers of security
measures protects the systems in our data centers. The access
to sensitive or critical data from outside of the secured data
center networks is protected by the usage of secure protocols
and cryptographic measures. Besides that, annual penetra-
tion tests for applications with critical data (e.g. patient or
personnel data) are conducted.

Other risks
Liquidity and financing

The liquidity risk is defined as the risk that a company is
potentially unable to meet its financial obligations. The Man-
agement Board of the Company manages the liquidity of the
Group by means of effective working capital and cash man-
agement as well as an anticipatory evaluation of refinancing
alternatives. The Management of the Company believes that
existing credit facilities, cash flow from operating activities
and additional short-term borrowings are sufficient to meet
the Company's foreseeable demand for liquidity.

At December 31, 2019 respectively December 31, 2018, the
Group had financial debt and lease liabilities of €13.78 BN
respectively €7.55 BN. The Company's credit agreements and
notes include covenants that require maintaining certain

72

financial ratios or meeting other financial tests. The cove-
nants also restrict the Company's ability to dispose of assets,
incur debt, pay dividends and other restricted payments, cre-
ate liens or make investments or acquisitions. The breach of
any of the covenants could result in a default and accelera-
tion of payments of the indebtedness, which would have an
adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition
and results of operations. The Company considers itself able
to maintain the required financial ratios at present and in the
near future.

Currencies and interests

The Company actively manages foreign currency and interest
rate exposures that are part of its normal business activities.
Risk management procedures for foreign currencies and
interest rate exposures are based on strategies defined and, if
necessary, adapted in close cooperation with the Manage-
ment Board, including, for example, guidelines that cover all
steps and levels of the risk management process. They define
responsibilities for the determination of risks, the careful use
of financial instruments for hedging purposes and for accu-
rate financial reporting. The use of derivative instruments is
restricted to micro hedges which are used in order to hedge
exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business. The
Company does not enter into transactions for trading or
other speculative purposes. The Company enters into trans-
actions with banks, which generally have ratings in the “A”
Category or better, as approved by the Management Board.
The effectiveness of the hedging relationships of the hedging
instruments and the hedged items is tested on a quarterly basis.

The Company enters into derivatives, particularly interest rate
swaps and to a certain extent, interest rate options to protect
against the risk of rising interest rates. These interest rate
derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have
been entered into in order to effectively convert payments

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

based on variable interest rates into payments at a fixed inter-
est rate. At December 31, 2019 no interest rate swaps were
in place. At December 31, 2018, the notional amount of the
euro-denominated interest rate swaps in place was €204 M.

Derivative foreign currency contracts are entered into for the
purpose of limiting the exchange rate exposure from sales
and purchases as well as lendings and borrowings between
the Company's subsidiaries located in different countries and
reporting in different currencies. A large portion of the trans-
action exposures arise from sales of products from the Com-
pany’s subsidiaries in the euro region to other international
business units. The aggregate notional amount of foreign
currency hedge contracts as of December 31, 2019 was
€742 M, primarily for hedging Euro exposure to the u.s. dol-
lar and various other currencies. Economic hedges, which are
used by the Company, are accounted for as recognized
hedges in the consolidated financial statements, when necessary.

The estimation and quantification of transaction risks from
foreign currencies is determined according to the statistical
model Cash Flow at Risk (“CFaR”). CFaR indicates the maxi-
mum amount of a potential loss of the forecasted foreign
exchange cash flow of the next twelve months that occurs
with a probability of 95 %. As of December 31, 2019, the
Company's CFaR amounts to €41.3 M.

Further information on market, default and liquidity risks is
included in Note 23 of notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

Litigation and other exposures

Risks associated with investigations and litigations are contin-
uously identified, assessed and reported within the Company.
The Company is involved in various legal proceedings and
investigations resulting from its business operations. A nega-

tive outcome of these legal proceedings or investigations
leading to legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on
the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

External legal consulting support is always used to defend the
Company against risks associated with litigations. If necessary
accounting measures like accruals are used.

For the matters in which the Company believes a loss is both
reasonably possible and assessable, an estimate of the loss or
range of loss exposure is provided in NoTE 22 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements. For other proceedings the
Company believes that the loss probability is remote and/or
the loss or range of possible losses cannot be reasonably esti-
mated at this time.

For details on ongoing proceedings and further information
on material legal risks to which the Company is exposed, ref-
erence is made to NoTE 22 of notes to the consolidated finan-
cial statements.

Taxes

The Company is subject to ongoing tax audits in the u.s.,
Germany and other jurisdictions. The Company could poten-
tially receive notices of unfavorable adjustments and disal-
lowances in connection with certain of these audits. If the
Company is unsuccessful in contesting unfavorable determi-
nations we could be required to make additional tax pay-
ments, which could have a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition and results of operations in the
relevant reporting period.

In general, tax-relevant issues are, as necessary, coordinated
with internal tax experts regarding compliance with applica-
ble tax laws. If necessary, statements and opinions by exter-
nal consultants are obtained to minimize tax risks.

73

International operations

The Company operates dialysis clinics in around 50 countries
and sells a range of equipment, products and services to cus-
tomers in around 150 countries. The Company's international
operations are subject to a number of risks, including but not
limited to the following:

» The economic and political situation in certain countries
could deteriorate or become unstable.

The Company could face difficulties in enforcing and collect-
ing accounts receivable under some countries’ legal systems.
Local regulations could restrict the Company's ability to
obtain a direct ownership interest in dialysis clinics or other
operations.

Some countries or economic unions may impose charges or
restrictions, such as local content requirements, which
restrict the importation of our products.

Potential increases in tariffs and trade barriers that could
result from withdrawal by the United States or other coun-
tries from unions, including the exit from major multilateral
trade agreements or the imposition of retaliatory tariffs and
other countermeasures in the wake of trade disputes.
Transport delays or interruptions.

International growth and expansion into emerging markets
could cause us difficulty due to greater regulatory barriers
than in the United States or Western Europe, the necessity
of adapting to new regulatory systems, and problems
related to entering new markets with different economic,
social, legal and political systems and conditions.

» Failure to prevail in competitive contract tenders.

We conduct humanitarian-related business directly or indi-
rectly in sanctioned countries. In case of violation of applica-
ble economic sanctions or export controls laws and regula-
tions, the Company could be subject to enforcement actions,
which vary between jurisdictions and depend on the factual

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

circumstances of the given violation, but could include crimi-
nal penalties, imprisonment of responsible individuals, admin-
istrative or civil penalties, restricted access to certain markets
and reputational harm, among others.

The Company's internal control policies and procedures may
not protect it from deliberate, reckless or inadvertent acts of
our employees or agents that contravene our compliance pol-
icies or violate applicable laws.

Any one or more of these or other factors relevant to interna-
tional operations could increase the Company’s costs, reduce
revenues, or disrupt operations, with possible material
adverse effects on the Company's business and financial con-
dition.

Developments of this nature are continuously monitored and
analyzed and response measures like the extension of local
production capacities, the adaptation of product designs,
organizational changes and various others are set in place
based on case by case decisions.

Unpredictable events

Fresenius Medical Care operates dialysis facilities or manufac-
turing facilities in many regions of the world, with diverse
geographic, societal and economic conditions. Events such as
natural disasters, terrorist attacks, political instability, epi-
demics as well as other unforeseeable events, could affect
our services and our ability to deliver in a limited time and
place.

Through forward-looking planning and prevention programs,
Fresenius Medical Care is trying to limit possible effects of
such events already in advance. In addition, to maintain oper-
ations in the event of an onset and to reduce potential impact
on our patients and the organization, we have spare capacity

Subsequent events

and safety stock of certain resources as well as emergency
and recovery plans in place. Residual risks are eventually cov-
ered when necessary and expedient by taking out insurance.

Global economic conditions and disruptions
in financial markets

The Company is dependent on the conditions of the financial
markets and the global economy. In order to pursue its
business, the Company is reliant on capital, as are its renal
product customers and commercial health care insurers.
Limited or more expensive access to capital in the financial
markets could adversely affect the Company's business and
profitability.

Among other things, the potential decline in federal and
state revenues may create additional pressures to contain or
reduce reimbursements for the Company’s services from pub-
lic payors around the world, including Medicare, Medicaid in
the United States and other government sponsored programs
in the United States and other countries around the world.

Job losses or increases in the unemployment rate in the u.s.
may result in a smaller percentage of the Company's patients
being covered by an employer group health plan and a larger
percentage being covered by lower paying Medicare and
Medicaid programs. To the extent that payors are negatively
impacted by a decline in the economy, the Company may
experience further pressure on commercial rates, a further
slowdown in collections and a reduction in the amounts it
expects to collect. Any or all of these factors, or other conse-
quences of the continuation, or worsening, of domestic and
global economic conditions which cannot currently be pre-
dicted, could continue to have an adverse effect on our busi-
nesses and results of operations.

74

Changes in the risk situation

Fresenius Medical Care operates in a constantly changing
environment. Accordingly, the risk situation is also subject to
constant change.

Regarding the classification of single risks in terms of proba-
bility and potential impact, the following significant changes
occurred compared to the previous year:

One-year period:

Due to the fact that regulatory requirements currently dis-
cussed with regard to production processes can have an
impact mainly in the medium to long term, the risk relating to
the regulatory environment (1) has been reduced to a low risk
from a short-term perspective.

The risks arising from international operations (20) have
increased to a medium risk level due to deteriorating circum-
stances in terms of increasing protectionism and current
trade conflicts.

Five-year period:

Due to predominantly strategic effects from regulatory
requirements currently under discussion with regard to pro-
duction processes, the risk from the regulatory environment
(1) has increased to a medium risk in the medium term.

Due to significant acquisitions made last year, risks from
growth (7) are now rated as medium risk.

The first-time identification of procurement risks (12) with
regard to a five-year period has resulted in an assessment as
low risk.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

In addition, further developments in litigation and other
exposures (18) lead to a medium risk assessment.

The risks arising from international operations (20) have
increased to a medium risk level due to deteriorating circum-
stances in terms of increasing protectionism and current
trade conflicts.

OPPORTUNITIES MANAGEMENT
OPPORTUNITIES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

As much of our business is organized on a decentralized
basis, we are able to identify industry-specific trends and
requirements as well as the resultant opportunities in the dif-
ferent regions at an early stage and gear our actions to them.
We also perform comprehensive quantitative and qualitative
analyses to enable us to capture business opportunities. This
involves systematically evaluating relevant market data,
closely examining research projects and taking general social
trends into consideration. Our analyses focus on general eco-
nomic, industry-specific, regional and local developments as
well as regulatory changes. In addition, close cooperation
between our Strategy and Planning departments and the
managers of other divisions allows us to identify global
opportunities as early as possible.

OPPORTUNITIES

As a vertically integrated dialysis company, Fresenius Medical
Care can offer almost all of the products and services that a
patient with chronic kidney failure requires for treatment.
Our network of 3,994 dialysis clinics in around 50 countries is
the largest of its kind in the world. As a result, we possess
valuable dialysis expertise that is unique in the industry.
Thanks to this wealth of experience, we know that high qual-

ity is not only the key to a better quality of life for patients,
but can also make a significant contribution to reducing the
costs of health care. Based on this understanding and our
business model, major opportunities arise that could have a
positive impact on the results of operations, financial position
and net assets of Fresenius Medical Care as things stand
today.

Industry-specific opportunities
Patient growth and demographic development

The dialysis market is a growth market that is largely unaf-
fected by macroeconomic influences. According to estimates,
the number of people worldwide suffering from chronic kid-
ney failure and requiring dialysis treatment is rising at a rela-
tively constant rate of around 6 % annually. It is expected to
reach around 3.7 M patients in 2020 and approximately
4.9 M by 2025 (SEE CHART 2.36). Social trends play a role in
this increase in patient numbers. In Europe and the u.s. in
particular, they include the aging population and the increas-
ing incidence of diabetes and hypertension, two illnesses that
frequently precede the onset of chronic kidney failure. In
developing and emerging countries, the growing population
and gradually improved access to dialysis as a result of
increasing wealth are key factors that further boost demand
for dialysis products and services. We want to continue to
make a significant contribution to meeting this demand in
the future.

Changes in legal and political conditions

Whether private companies can offer dialysis treatment and
in what form depends on a country’s health care system and
its legal framework. For Fresenius Medical Care, opportuni-
ties arise to tap into new markets or to expand its market
share whenever a country opens up to private dialysis provid-

ers. These decisions are also increasingly influenced by the
following factors:

» Health care systems are under pressure to deliver ever more
comprehensive medical care (longer life expectancy, increase
in concomitant diseases, fully-functioning health care provi-
sion still being established).

» Dialysis is a complex life-sustaining procedure, which places
high demands on health care systems in terms of expertise
and efficiency. Therefore, public health care providers are
increasingly looking for solutions together with private
providers.

Public-private partnerships

In some countries, public-private partnerships (ppp) are an
attractive business model for Fresenius Medical Care. These
are contractually defined project alliances between the public
sector and private companies in which both partners share

the financing, tasks, risks and opportunities of a project. Our
extensive dialysis expertise gives us a competitive edge here,
as it enables us to flexibly offer various levels of care for hos-
pitals, health insurers, local or national authorities. Depend-
ing on the contract, we set up new dialysis clinics and install
the equipment, train medical personnel in quality, hygiene
and nutrition, or manage the clinics ourselves on the terms
agreed. This enables the public sector to care for more
patients more effectively and less expensively. The ppp model
allows Fresenius Medical Care to tap into new markets,
expand its market share, and extend its range of products
and services with new forms of health care.

Growing demand for holistic, value-oriented
health care

As a result of increasing cost pressure and the growing num-
ber of patients, demand for holistic and value-oriented health
care concepts for patients with chronic kidney failure is grow-

ing worldwide. Value-oriented models are changing the role
of health care providers: In systems of this kind, we not only
take care of dialysis, but also take responsibility for the
patient's medical well-being beyond dialysis. Value-oriented
health care models help to deliver higher-quality treatment
outcomes for patients at a lower cost.

We have supported this development from the start, because
we know the needs of our dialysis patients best. We have
bundled coordination of all aspects of medical care in our
Care Coordination business. This encompasses all services
that help us to offer our dialysis patients holistic treatment.

Growing importance of home therapies

If patient numbers grow as strongly as anticipated, cost pres-
sure continues to rise, and clinics reach full capacity, home
therapies are expected to take on a more important role in
dialysis. This development could be advantageous for
Fresenius Medical Care, as it presents us with growth oppor-
tunities. We offer a host of different products and innovative
solutions for home dialysis. By acquiring the u.s. company
NxStage, which develops, produces, and markets dialysis
machines and further products for home dialysis and inten-
sive care, we have further expanded our home dialysis port-
folio. We focus firmly on the needs of our patients by offering
them the widest possible range of therapy options. This gives
them the freedom to choose what treatment they prefer.
Self-determination is a key pillar of our vision of improving
our patients’ quality of life.

Opportunities related to our business operations
New products and technologies

Developing innovative products and technologies that deliver
lasting added value for patients and remuneration systems

76

until they are market-ready is another crucial factor in our
long-term success. We advance dialysis-related innovations
through our in-house research and development activities. In
addition, we are able to enhance existing products ourselves
and adapt them to the markets in which we operate. We will
continue to add innovative products and technologies to our
range in the future in order to capture growth opportunities
and meet the demand for integrated care as effectively as
possible.

Internal organization and procedures

Fresenius Medical Care benefits from a number of long-term
opportunities in the way it is organized and designs its busi-
ness operations. For example, all production sites follow the
“Lean Manufacturing” approach which, in North America
and our Schweinfurt plant, includes the “Lean Six Sigma”
management system. The focus of Lean Manufacturing and
Six Sigma is on the continuous improvement of all manufac-
turing processes to achieve a low defect rate resulting in
improved product quality, while reducing manufacturing
times. In addition, constantly improving business processes
and rigorously optimizing cost structures helps to make
Fresenius Medical Care even more profitable and competi-
tive. With its global efficiency program, the Company has laid
the foundation for a continuous and sustainable increase in
efficiency.

Capital expenditure and acquisitions

We generate ideas for growth initiatives from market analy-
ses and evaluate them as part of our annual budget planning,
or more frequently if necessary. We manage the investments
required for implementing projects using a detailed coordina-
tion and evaluation process. The Management Board sets the
investment budget for the Group as well as the focus of
investment. Before realizing investment projects, an internal

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

committee examines the individual projects and measures,
taking into account their yield requirements and potential
return on investment. Projects are undertaken only if they
help to increase the Company's value.

We are investing in our future growth by expanding our
health care services business through acquisitions and pur-
chasing expertise and relevant technologies in the area of
Rab. Thanks to close collaboration between our Strategy and
Planning departments and the managers responsible for our
acquisitions, we are able to identify suitable potential pur-
chases worldwide at an early stage.

Fresenius Medical Care's business model

Our business model itself also provides opportunities for
Fresenius Medical Care's future growth. As a vertically inte-
grated dialysis company, we not only offer almost all of the
products and services that a patient with chronic kidney fail-
ure requires for treatment, but also use these on a daily basis
in our own clinics. As a result, we can incorporate the feed-
back from our patients, physicians and nurses worldwide in
developing and manufacturing new products as well as in
organizing our clinic management. This gives us a crucial
competitive edge.

ASSESSMENT OF

THE OVERALL RISK POSITION
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES

BY THE MANAGEMENT

The risk management system implemented at Fresenius
Medical Care forms the basis for assessing the overall risk
position of the Group. The overall risk position of Fresenius
Medical Care is determined by the individual risks described
above. Changes in the Group's risk situation compared to the
previous year occurred as stated in the paragraph of the same
name, starting on pace 74. As far as we are aware, there are
currently no risks that could endanger the continued exis-
tence of Fresenius Medical Care. As part of the Compa-
ny-wide review of the integrated management system, we
monitor the effectiveness of the implemented risk manage-
ment system and make improvements where necessary. The
Management Board will continue to expand our risk manage-
ment as well as the review of the related management system
to be able to identify, examine and evaluate potential risks
even more quickly and initiate appropriate countermeasures.
We believe that we have taken all necessary organizational
steps to recognize potential risks early on and to respond to
them appropriately.

We remain confident that our integrated global business
model and our earning power provide us with a sound basis
for our business development, allowing us to capture the
potential arising for the Company. In view of our leading
position in the dialysis market, our innovative strength, our
dedicated staff, and our structured processes for identifying
risks early on and managing opportunities, we are convinced
that we can continue to make the most of any opportunities
that arise for our business in a responsible manner in the
future.

par bearer shares, and a nominal value of €1 each. On the
basis of the authorization granted by the Company's Annual
General Meeting on May 12, 2011 to conduct a share buy-
back program, the Company repurchased 7,548,951 shares
in 2013. The Company redeemed 6,549,000 of these repur-
chased shares on February 16, 2016. On the basis of the
authorization granted by the Company's Annual General

gram, the Company repurchased further 660,000 shares
between December 11, 2017, and December 21, 2017
(including) and further 431,000 shares between May 28,

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

2018 and June 8, 2018 (including). The company redeemed
the 1,091,000 shares repurchased in 2017 and 2018 on
December 12, 2018. In the period from March 12, 2019 to
May 10, 2019 (including) the Company repurchased further
3,770,772 shares for an average weighted stock price of
€71.55 on the basis of the authorization granted by the
Company‘s Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2016. The
company redeemed the 3,770,772 shares repurchased in the
period from March 12, 2019 to May 10, 2019 (including) on

pany's Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2016. As of

treasury shares. Treasury shares held correspond to approxi-
mately €6.1 M or 2.01 % of the Company's share capital.
Voting rights may not be exercised on treasury shares. The
treasury shares were acquired in the course of share buyback
programs on the stock exchange via the xeTRA trading system

304,436,876 shares. The acquired treasury shares will only be
used to reduce the Company's share capital (by cancellation
of the relevant shares) or to service employee incentive plans.

The rights of the shareholders are governed by the German
Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the Company's Articles of
Association. This stipulates that each share shall be entitled to
one vote at the Company's Annual General Meeting.

AG, is responsible for managing and representing the Com-
pany. Similarly, it does not participate in the profit or loss or

ment authority also encompasses exceptional management
measures, which do not require approval by the shareholders.
Vis-a-vis the General Partner, the Company is represented by
its Supervisory Board.

The General Partner will cease to be General Partner of the
Company if and when all shares in the General Partner entity
are no longer held directly or indirectly by one party, which at
the same time must hold, directly or indirectly by means of a
controlled company as defined by sec. 17 para.1 AktG, more
than 25 % of the Company's share capital. This does not
apply if all the shares of the General Partner entity are held
directly or indirectly by the Company. Additionally, the Gen-
eral Partner will cease to be the Company’s General Partner if
the shares in the General Partner entity are acquired by
another person

» who does not at the same time acquire shares of the Com-
pany in the amount of more than 25 % of the Company's
capital or

» who has not, within three months after the effectiveness of
such acquisition, submitted a voluntary or mandatory take-
over offer to the Company's shareholders according to the
rules of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act
(WpUG); the fair consideration offered to the shareholders
must also reflect the consideration which the purchaser
pays for the shares in the General Partner entity, if the
amount for such consideration is above the amount of its
equity capital.

The other grounds for withdrawal as provided by the law
remain unaffected with respect to the General Partner.

As at December 31, 2019, Fresenius st & CO. KGAA, Bad Hom-
burg v. d. Héhe, Germany holds 94,380,382 shares of the
Company, corresponding to 31.00 % holding and hence in
excess of 10 % of the Company’s total share capital. After

deduction of treasury shares held by the Company in accor-
dance with sec. 16 para. 2 HGB sentence 2 AktG, Fresenius se
& CO. KGAA holds 31.64 % of the Company’s voting rights.

The appointment and removal of members of the Manage-
ment Board of the General Partner entity are governed by
sec. 84 and sec. 85 AktG. Changes in the Articles of Associa-
tion of the company must be made in accordance with sec.
278 para. 3 AktG, sec. 179 AktG in conjunction with sec. 133
AktG unless otherwise provided for in the Articles of Associa-
tion. The Articles of Association entitle the Company’s Super-
visory Board, without resolution of the General Meeting, to
make amendments to the Articles of Association which con-
cern only its wording.

The General Partner is entitled, subject to approval by the
Supervisory Board, to increase the Company's share capital as
follows in accordance with the resolutions passed by the
shareholders’ at the General Meeting:

» Authorization, in the period up to May 18, 2020 to increase,
on one or more occasions, the Company's share capital by
up to a total of €35 M by issuing new bearer ordinary shares
in return for cash contributions (Authorized Capital 2015/1).

» Authorization, in the period up to May 18, 2020 to increase,
on one or more occasions, the Company's share capital by
up to a total of €25 M by issuing new bearer ordinary shares
in return for non-cash contributions (Authorized Capital
2015/ll).

In both cases, the General Partner is entitled, with the
approval of the Supervisory Board and in accordance with the
resolutions passed at the General Meeting, to decide on the
exclusion of shareholders’ pre-emption rights.

In addition to the above, the following conditional capital is
in place:

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2019

» A conditional increase of up to €9.728 M. This conditional
share capital increase will only be carried out to the extent
that options were issued in accordance with the Stock
Option Plan 2011 based on the shareholders’ resolutions
taken on May 12, 2011 and May 12, 2016, the holders of
such options exercise their rights and the Company does
not issue any own (treasury) shares to settle the options; in
the case of options issued to members of the Management
Board of the General Partner entity, the Supervisory Board
of that entity shall be responsible.

In accordance with the resolution taken at the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting on May 12, 2016, the general partner is autho-
rized to acquire treasury shares until May 11, 2021 and up to
a maximum of 10 % of the share capital in place at the date
of the resolution. At no stage shall the acquired shares
together with other treasury shares held by the Company or
attributable to it pursuant to sec. 71a ff. AktG exceed 10 %
of the Company's share capital. The acquisition can be made
via the stock exchange or by means of a public invitation to
submit offers for sale. The authorization may not be used for
the purposes of trading in its own shares. The general partner
is authorized to use the shares of the Company acquired on
the basis of this or an earlier authorization for all legally
admissible purposes, in particular (i) to withdraw them from
circulation without any requirement for a further resolution
to be taken at the Annual General Meeting, (ii) to sell them
to third parties in return for contributions in kind, (iii) rather
than using conditional capital, to award them to employees
of the Company and its affiliates (including to members of
the executive managements of affiliates) and to use them to
service rights or commitments to acquire shares of the Com-
pany and (iv) to service bonds with option or conversion
rights issued by the Company or by dependent companies as
defined by sec. 17 AktG.

Subsequent events

A change of control resulting from a takeover offer could,
under certain circumstances, have an impact on several of the
Company's long-term financing arrangements, in which mar-
ket standard change of control clauses are in place. These
clauses give creditors the right to call for early repayment of
outstanding amounts in the event of a change in control. In
most of these financing agreements — in particular in case of
the bonds which are placed in the capital markets — the right
to terminate only exists, however, if the change of control
involves the Company’s rating or the corresponding financing
instrument being downgraded.
