Business model

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

1.1 Business model

Evonik is one of the world’s leading specialty chemicals com-
panies. Our strengths include the balanced spectrum of our
business activities, end-markets, and regions. Around 80 per-
cent of sales come from market-leading positions', which
we are systematically expanding. Our strong competitive
Position is based on close collaboration with customers, our
high innovative capability, and our integrated technology
platforms.

Our specialty chemicals products make an indispensable
contribution to the benefits of our customers’ products, which
generate their success in global competition. Close cooperation
with our customers enables us to build up a deep knowledge
of their business, so we can offer products tailored to their
specifications and extensive technical service. Our technology
centers and customer competence centers play an important
role in this around the world.

Market-oriented research and development is a key driver
of profitable growth. This is based on our strong innovation
culture, which is rooted in our innovation management and
management development. Good ideas are rapidly recognized,
driven forward, and implemented with our customers.

Highly trained employees are a key success factor. They
drive forward the company on a daily basis through their hard
work and identification. We have therefore developed a wide
range of activities to gain and develop talented and qualified
employees and to position Evonik as a preferred employer in
order to retain them.

As preconditions for Evonik’s future viability, sustainable
business activities and responsible conduct are cornerstones
of our business model. We drive forward our sustainability
activities along the value chain in close dialogue with our
stakeholders. As well as our own production processes and
the products we market, we always consider the supply chain

and the product benefits for our customers and their customers.
We have observed rising demand for products that demonstrate
a good balance of economic, ecological, and social factors.
That opens up a broad spectrum of future-oriented business
opportunities for Evonik in attractive markets. Sustainability
has long been a growth driver in many of our businesses.

In view of this, we defined our sustainability strategy in
more detail in 2018, especially as regards foresighted
resource management and integrating sustainability into stra-
tegic management processes.

A decentralized corporate structure

Our specialty chemicals operations are divided into three
chemical manufacturing segments, which operate close to
their markets and customers and have a high degree of en-
trepreneurial independence. They are supported by a Services
segment.

The Nutrition & Care and Resource Efficiency segments op-
erate principally in attractive markets with above-average
growth rates. Both segments offer customers customized,
innovation-driven solutions. The aim for these segments is to
achieve above-average, profitable growth through innovations,
investments, and acquisitions.

The Performance Materials segment is characterized by
processes that make intensive use of energy and raw materials.
It therefore concentrates on integrated, cost-optimized tech-
nology platforms, efficient workflows, and economies of scale.
Our strategic goal for this segment is to contribute earnings
to finance the growth of the Evonik Group. Investments and,
where appropriate, alliances concentrate on securing our
good market positions.

1.2 Principles and objectives

Building a best-in-class specialty

chemicals company

We want to make Evonik a best-in-class specialty chemicals
company. This global aspiration is closely linked to our goal
of profitable growth. To increase the value of our company,
our strategy has three focal areas:

+ Amore balanced and more specialty portfolio

+ Leading in innovation

+ An open and performance-oriented culture.

Our goal is to step up our focus on businesses with clear spe-
cialty chemicals characteristics. To ensure an even better
balance within our portfolio and to grow where Evonik is

therefore close to our markets and our customers. Our largest
production sites, for example, Marl, Wesseling, and Rheinfelden
(Germany), Antwerp (Belgium), Mobile (Alabama, USA),
Shanghai (China), and Singapore, have integrated technology
platforms used by various units.

Integrated technology platforms are

a competitive advantage

Our products are manufactured using highly developed tech-
nologies that we are constantly refining. Evonik has many
integrated production complexes where key precursors are
produced in neighboring production facilities. In this way, we
offer our customers maximum reliability of supply. At the same
time, integrated world-scale production facilities combined
with technologically demanding production processes act as
high entry barriers.

Making good progress with the
digital transformation
Digitalization includes fundamental changes to processes in
the chemical industry. That starts with the use of artificial
intelligence in research and development and continues
through the procurement of raw materials, and planning and
operating production facilities, to marketing and sales.
Evonik is driving forward digitalization throughout the
Group. We want to explore new business models, solutions,
and services for our customers, and to empower our emplo-
yees for the digital world. Evonik also sees digitalization as an
opportunity to raise efficiency. To extend our position in the
digital world in the long term, we are entering into strategic
partnerships with technology companies, universities, and
cross-business networks.

already strong but there are especially promising prospects,
our strategy concentrates on four growth engines:

+ Specialty Additives

+ Animal Nutrition

+ Smart Materials

+ Health & Care.

Capital allocation for new developments and enhancements,
investment, and acquisitions will be concentrated principally
on these growth engines. Each of the four growth engines
focuses on different markets but they have one thing in com-
mon: They are aligned consistently to delivering innovative
solutions for issues and developments of relevance to industry
and end-customers in the coming decades.

Basic information on the Evonik Group
Principles and objectives

Growth engines

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Specialty Additives

Specialty additives improve the properties of countless everyday
products. Small quantities of these additives are used in production
processes to achieve a variety of different effects, for example, to
regulate the hardness of cushioning or the viscosity of lubricants.

Animal Nutrition

Sustainable food production is one of the big challenges of our time.
Globally, meat production is increasing as a result of rising living
standards in emerging markets. That means more land is required for
farming and also increases emissions of methane gases by cattle.
Evonik already offers many solutions to address this development.
Markets are also influenced by the desire for safer and better-quality
food and criticism of the use of antibiotics in animal nutrition.

Innovation is an important driver of profitable growth as it
leverages the development of new products and applications.
Our focus here is on working intensively with customers and
partners along the supply chain. Within the four growth
engines, Evonik has defined specific innovation growth fields’
that target highly attractive new markets where we can
effectively deploy our core competencies.

The third element is a performance-oriented culture based
on our new corporate values: performance, trust, openness,
and speed. We initiate change, keep our promises, reward
performance and readiness to take risks, foster thinking outside
the box, and are open to new ideas. We are agile, decisive,
and quick to react. We regard ourselves as an international
company and see diversity as an opportunity.

Ambitious targets
To support our goal of profitable growth, we have set six

ambitious financial targets:

Smart Materials

Smart materials have specially tailored functionalities that help to
optimize products and product properties. Examples are silica and
polyamide 12.

Health & Care

This growth engine comprises products and services for pharmaceu-
ticals, medical technology, cosmetics, and nutritional supplements.
Examples are pharmaceutical polymers, which release the active
ingredients in medicines in the body exactly when and where they
are needed.

As a responsible specialty chemicals company, we are also
continuing to pursue our ambitious non-financial targets?.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2018 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

1.3 Business management systems

Most important financial key performance indicators
Financial management of Evonik is based on a consistent
system of value-oriented indicators. These are used to assess
the business performance of the operational units and the
Group. Through systematic alignment to these indicators,
Evonik endeavors to create value by raising profitability and
ensuring profitable growth.

We use adjusted EBITDA (i.e., EBITDA after factoring out
special items) as a financial performance indicator. Adjusted
EBITDA and the corresponding relative indicator, the adjusted
EBITDA margin, show operating performance irrespective of
the structure of assets and the investment profile. We use this
in particular for internal and external comparisons of the cost
structure and profitability of our businesses.

The return on capital employed (ROCE) is used as a
further indicator of value-driven management of the company.
It is calculated from adjusted EBIT in relation to average capital
employed. Comparison with the cost of capital, which shows
the risk-adjusted return expectations of our investors, indicates
relative value creation. This is calculated using a weighted
average cost of capital, which reflects the return expectations
of both shareholders, derived from the capital asset pricing
model, and providers of debt capital.

The special items that are factored out when calculating
adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT include restructuring,
impairment losses/reversals of impairment losses, income
and expenses in connection with the purchase/disposal of
investments in companies, and other income and expense
items that, due to their nature or amount, do not reflect the
typical operating business. We consider that the adjusted
earnings figures are more suitable than unadjusted data for
comparing the performance of operating units over several
periods.

We also use free cash flow as an operational perfor-
mance indicator. This is calculated from the cash flow from
operating activities, continuing operations, less outflows for
capital expenditures on intangible assets, property, plant and
equipment. The free cash flow shows the remaining scope
for financing, i.e., the company’s internal financing capacity.

1 This is based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 2016.
2 See section on safety and environment.

Most important non-financial key performance
indicators
Evonik also uses a wide variety of non-financial performance

indicators. For example, our annual sustainability report!
provides information on ecological and societal issues to
supplement our economic reporting.

Traditionally, we accord special significance to safety,
which is regarded as a holistic management task that has to
be lived at all management levels. Our guiding principles on
safety are binding for staff at all levels and were reinforced in
2015 by a global safety culture initiative. In accordance with
corporate policy, all operational units at Evonik have an
occupational safety target. In addition, all production units
have a plant safety target. The relevant indicators are accident
frequency and incident frequency.?

FINANCIAL REPORT 2018 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

2.1 Overall assessment of the economic situation

Strategically, in 2018 we made good progress in strengthen-
ing our four defined growth engines: Specialty Additives,
Animal Nutrition, Smart Materials, and Health & Care, which
are characterized by above-average growth and low cyclical
exposure.

Major investments such as the construction of the methi-
onine complex in Singapore were driven forward purposefully
and new projects were initiated. These include the planned
construction of a production complex for the specialty polymer
polyamide 12 in Marl (Germany)—the biggest investment in
Evonik’s history in this country—and the proposed acquisition
of the US company PeroxyChem', Philadelphia (Pennsylvania,
USA), which is an excellent complement to our hydrogen
peroxide activities. Integration of the businesses acquired in
2017 from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Allentown
(Pennsylvania, USA) and J.M. Huber Corporation, Atlanta
(Georgia, USA) took place very successfully. The Oleo 20202
program introduced in 2018 is bundling our oleochemical
activities to raise efficiency, leverage synergies, and reduce
complexity.

The methacrylates business does not form part of our
growth engines; it comprises large-volume monomers such
as methylmethacrylate (MMA), various specialty monomers,
and the PLEXIGLAS® brand of PMMA molding compounds
and semi-finished products. In March 2018, we therefore
decided to examine all options for the future development of
this business, including potential partnerships and complete
separation. Similarly, the precursors for agrochemicals manu-
factured at the Jayhawk site in Galena (Kansas, USA) are not
part of our growth business. This site belonging to the
Performance Materials segment was divested in November
2018.

We have made good headway with the SG&A 2020
program? introduced at the end of 2017, which is geared to
global optimization of processes and a lasting reduction in
selling and administrative expenses. We expect further impetus
to come from the cultural change towards a more open,
performance-oriented corporate culture.

Operationally, our business developed successfully. Global
demand for our products was high and we achieved organic

2.2 Economic background

Lower global economic momentum

Global economic conditions developed in line with our
expectations in 2018. We estimate that the global economy as
a whole grew by around 3.2 percent in 2018. However,
growth was weaker than in the previous year (3.3 percent).
Economic sentiment deteriorated considerably during the

3 See section on business conditions and performance.

sales growth of 5 percent. This was principally attributable to
higher selling prices. The development of volume sales
varied. While volume growth in the Nutrition & Care seg-
ment was well above global economic growth (3.2 percent,
expected), the volume trend in the Performance Materials
segment was held back by the impact of the low water level in
the river Rhine. Overall, sales grew 4 percent to €15,024 mil-
lion.

Adjusted EBITDA rose 10 percent to €2,601 million. All
segments contributed to the earnings increase.

The adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 17.3 percent
(2017: 16.4 percent), but was nevertheless below the target
mid-term range of 18-20 percent. ROCE was 12.1 percent,
above both the cost of capital and the prior-year level
(11.2 percent).

Net income rose 31 percent to €932 million. Net income
after adjustment for special items increased 29 percent to a
new record of €1,294 million. At the annual shareholders’
meeting, the executive board and supervisory board will
again propose a dividend of €1.15 per share.

We generated a free cash flow of €672 million. That was
€161 million higher than in the previous year and well above
the dividend payment of €536 million for 2017. Our financial
profile is still very good: Evonik has a solid investment grade
rating. We were able to reduce net financial debt slightly
thanks to the free cash flow.

policy conflicts, this was due to the tightening of monetary
policy in the United States, leading to a reversal of interna-
tional capital flows, which dampened economic growth in
the emerging markets.

Overall, regional differences in economic momentum have
increased.

The pace of economic growth has recently dropped in
Western Europe. The automotive industry’s problems with
the certification of vehicles under the new emissions testing
procedure led to lower industrial output. Exports suffered
from weaker demand worldwide, and especially from China. In
addition, economic activity was dampened by the heightened
political uncertainty caused by the prospect of Brexit and the
change of government in Italy.

Weaker growth in Eastern Europe was largely due to the
slowdown in Turkey. The Russian economy continued its
modest growth path. While the economy was supported by
private consumption, it was held back by the downturn in
manufacturing industry.

The strong growth in North America was driven principally
by the US economy, which benefited from extensive tax cuts
and an increase in state investment. Higher employment and
pay rises boosted domestic consumption. In view of the good
economic situation, the Federal Reserve continued to tighten
monetary policy, raising its key interest rate by a total of
1.0 percentage points in four steps to 2.5 percent.

2.3 Major events

On November 7, 2018, we signed an agreement with One
Equity Partners, Chicago (Illinois, USA) to acquire the US
company PeroxyChem, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania, USA) for
USS625 million. PeroxyChem is a manufacturer of hydrogen
peroxide and peracetic acid and is well positioned in high-
margin specialty applications. This acquisition expands our

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Growth in Central & South America was relatively low. Political
uncertainty, high levels of unemployment and private debt,
together with structural problems, again prevented a significant
improvement in the economic situation. Argentina slipped back
into recession after two years of economic growth.

The Asia-Pacific region posted slightly slower growth than
in the previous year. Economic momentum in Japan fell as a
result of lower industrial output and weaker export trade. The
trade dispute with the USA, the reduction in debt, and reforms
resulted in lower growth in China.

Weaker development of end-customer industries
Worldwide, the development of Evonik’s end-customer
industries differed by region and by sector in 2018. We
anticipate that overall industrial growth was lower than in the
previous year.

Compared with the previous year, demand for consumer
and care products was higher in North America, driven by an
improvement in consumer sentiment and falling unemploy-
ment, and remained high in the Asia-Pacific region. Growth
in the food and feed sectors gained pace in North America
but weakened in Central & South America. Automotive and
mechanical engineering output declined year-on-year in
Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific. In Europe, growth
momentum in the construction sector was higher than in
2017 thanks to an increase in capital spending, while growth
rates in the Asia-Pacific region stabilized.

As a result of the significant rise in the price of crude oil
between January and October 2018, the price of Evonik’s
petrochemical feedstocks increased steadily over this period,
but fell again in November and December 2018 thanks to the
sharp drop in the oil price. In addition, strong demand
without any expansion of supply resulted in further price
rises for other raw materials. Overall, there was a year-on-
year increase Evonik’s raw material price index in 2018.

The average annual exchange rate for the euro against
Evonik’s most important currency—the US dollar—increased
to USS$1.18, compared to the average exchange rate in the
previous year (USS$1.13).

Furthermore, it gives us an attractive business characterized
by above-average growth, moderate capital intensity, and
low cyclicality. The transaction should be closed in mid-2019.

2.4 Business conditions and performance

Organic sales growth

The Evonik Group grew sales 4 percent to €15,024 million.
The 5 percent organic sales growth was driven by higher
selling prices, resulting in some cases from passing on higher
raw material costs. Overall, volumes were on the same level as
in the previous year, partly due to the restrictions on the trans-
portation of goods in fall 2018 caused by low water levels in
the river Rhine. 1 percentage point of the rise in sales came
from the initial consolidation of the silica business acquired
from J. M. Huber Corporation, Atlanta (Georgia, USA) effective
September 1, 2017 (contained in portfolio/other effects).
Negative exchange rate movements had a counter-effect.

prices. In view of the sustained high level of demand, the rise
in the Resource Efficiency segment’s adjusted EBITDA was
mainly driven by prices. The Performance Materials segment
posted slightly higher earnings, and earnings in the Services
segment were considerably higher. The adjusted EBITDA
reported by corporate, other operations, including consolida-
tion, was higher than in the prior year, partly due to cost-
saving measures. Among other things, it includes expenses

Business conditions and performance

The adjustments totaled —€357 million, compared with
—€261 million in 2017. The considerable increase in restruc-
turing expenses was mainly due to the SG&A 2020 program
to reduce administrative and selling expenses, the Oleo 2020
program to raise the efficiency of the oleochemicals business
in the Nutrition & Care segment, and shutdown of a production
site in Hungary. The adjustment category purchase/sale of
investments contains expenses of €31 million, mainly for inte-
gration of the businesses acquired in 2017 and the planned
acquisition of PeroxyChem. The category others includes
expenses for examining the options for the future development
of the methacrylates business and a project to optimize the
procurement of outsourced services. The previous year’s figure
of —€261 million mainly comprised expenses in connection
with the acquisitions made in 2017 and impairment losses on
assets in the Resource Efficiency and Nutrition & Care seg-
ments.

The financial result improved to —€165 million. It contains
special items of —€3 million for interest expense in connection
with the establishment of provisions. The prior-year figure of
—€203 million contained special items of -€27 million, prin-
cipally for impairment losses on loans to an equity investment
(-€13 million) and currency hedging of the purchase price of
the Huber silica business (€9 million). The adjusted financial

result improved by €14 million to -€162 million. Income
before income taxes, continuing operations rose 18 percent
to €1,202 million. The income tax rate of 21 percent was
mainly attributable to lower foreign tax rates and positive
effects from the remeasurement of deferred taxes. The
income tax rate after factoring out taxes on special items was
23 percent.

Net income improved 31 percent to €932 million, mainly
as a result of the higher operating result.

We use adjusted net income to assess the earnings power of
the continuing operations, especially on a long-term view, and
to forecast future development. The calculation starts from
EBITDA after adjustment for special items'. The financial
result is then adjusted for income and expenses in connection
with the purchase/disposal of equity investments and other
income and expense items that, by nature or amount, do not
form part of typical current financing activities. Further, we
deduct amortization of intangible assets, which mainly results
from acquisitions, and adjust income tax for taxes on special
items.

In 2018, adjusted net income improved 29 percent to a new
record of €1,294 million as a result of the good operating
performance.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2018 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Efficient and effective procurement

Reliable supply, gaining access to new procurement markets,
and ongoing optimization of material costs are key tasks for
our procurement function.

The principal factors in 2018 were restricted availability of
raw materials and rising raw material prices. Production prob-
lems at some key suppliers, the persistently low level of
water in the river Rhine, and the escalating trade dispute
between the USA and China were major influences. Other
contributory factors were multiple plant closures in China as
a consequence of a more restrictive environmental policy.
Because of our sustainability strategy, we were not directly
affected by this, but it nevertheless caused an additional tight-
ening of supply on raw material markets.

In 2018, we drove forward the use of new digital procure-
ment solutions to automate further operational tasks and
increase the value created by strategic activities. For instance,
the procurement function is working on an application to use
artificial intelligence to gain a competitive advantage in the
procurement of raw materials by speeding up the response to
events affecting the market, reducing the time required to
obtain information, and improving our negotiating position. In
addition, we are actively examining the use of new methods
such as machine learning to automate and improve forecasting
of raw material prices.

Indirect procurement (procurement of general and technical
goods and services) focused on the global introduction of a
new cloud-based IT solution for catalogue orders, which
brought a further increase in the automation rate. Optimization
continued in 2018 in the procurement of construction and
technical services to deal with the challenges resulting from
the skills shortage and the construction boom in Germany.
Here, significant progress was made in validating new sup-
pliers and extending long-term supply relationships.

As well as participating in procurement alliances with other
companies and validating new suppliers, we are working
intensively to extend strategic relationships with suppliers.
Here we are looking for additional opportunities to reduce
risk, optimize costs, and enhance cooperation and innovation
with the suppliers that are currently of the greatest strategic
importance. We are aware of our responsibility within the
supply chain. Issues such as safety, health, environmental
protection, corporate responsibility, and quality play an integral
part in our procurement strategy. These sustainability aspects
are also supported by standardized global audits and assess-
ments through the Together for Sustainability (TfS) sector

initiative, which was co-founded by Evonik. An audit or
assessment has already been performed on Evonik’s principal
suppliers and 83 percent of suppliers of critical raw materials’.

In 2018, Evonik spent around €9.9 billion on raw materials
and supplies, technical goods, services, energy, and other
operating supplies. Raw materials make up around 60 percent
of procurement volume. Spending on petrochemical feed-
stocks is around €4.0 billion and accounts for 67 percent of
our raw material base.

Using renewable resources remains important to Evonik. In
2018, around 8 percent of raw materials were from renewable
resources. The main applications for these raw materials are
amino acids and starting products for the cosmetics industry.

Another good return on capital employed

Within our value-oriented management approach, our success
is measured principally by ROCE, which was 12.1 percent in
2018 and therefore above our cost of capital. In our regular
review in 2018, the cost of capital was confirmed as being
10.0 percent before taxes, unchanged from the previous year.

Business conditions and performance
Comparison of forecast and actual performance

The average capital employed increased by €1.0 billion to
€14.3 billion. The acquisition of the Air Products specialty
additives business and the Huber silica business in 2017 made
a substantial contribution to this. Due to the use of an average,
these additions had a full impact on average capital employed
for the first time in 2018. In particular, this increased intangible
assets, property plant and equipment, and net working capital.

Thanks to the good development of adjusted EBIT, the
Evonik Group's ROCE increased in 2018 even though average
capital employed was higher.

In the three chemical segments, ROCE was above the cost
of capital. In the Resource Efficiency and Performance Materials
segments, ROCE was well above average. The Nutrition &
Care segment increased ROCE slightly year-on-year.

Clear value creation

Economic value added (EVA®) is the difference between
adjusted EBIT and the cost of capital, which is calculated by
multiplying average capital employed by the average cost of
capital (WACC). If EVA® is positive, the Group creates value
(value spread approach). In 2018, we generated EVA® of
€294 million. The improvement of €133 million compared
with the previous year was attributable to the rise in the oper-
ating result.

rise in volumes and higher selling prices contributed to this.
Negative currency movements had a counter-effect.

In the healthcare business, a very successful performance
was posted by functional polymers for smart drug delivery
systems for oral and parenteral pharmaceutical applications
and by exclusive synthesis for the pharmaceutical industry.
Personal care products posted clear sales growth thanks to
higher volumes and selling prices. Sales of additives for polymer
foam, which are used, for example, in mattresses and in insul-
ating materials, were around the prior-year level. Growth in
the market for essential amino acids for animal nutrition,
especially methionine, remained robust. Sales were around
the previous year’s level, while volumes increased. Selling
prices were lower than in the previous year as a result of the
improved availability of products. A wide range of measures

customer relationship management and leverage synergies in
production. In addition, two sites in the UK and Spain are to
be closed.

Perceptible improvement in adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA in the Nutrition & Care segment rose 8 per-
cent to €810 million. This was due to volume growth, the

Segment performance

Higher capital expenditures

Capital expenditures in the Nutrition & Care segment increased
24 percent to €486 million. The increase was attributable to
major investment in another world-scale production complex
for methionine in Singapore. Capital expenditures were
therefore well above depreciation and amortization, which
was €263 million. The average capital employed increased to
€4,774 million, principally due to capital expenditures. ROCE
rose to 11.2 percent as a result of the increase in earnings.

Investment projects to drive growth

In view of the strong growth in the market for methionine,
Nutrition & Care is currently building a further world-scale
production complex in Singapore. It will be located alongside
the facility on Jurong Island that came into service in Novem-
ber 2014, and will be fully backwardly integrated, including
production of all precursors and intermediates. Start-up is
scheduled for mid-2019.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

The Veramaris joint venture established by Evonik and Royal
DSM, Heerlen (Netherlands) is currently building a plant to
produce omega-3 fatty acids from natural sea algae. Together,
the two partners are investing around US$200 million in this
new plant at Evonik’s site in Blair (Nebraska, USA), where it
will have access to decades of experience of industrial fer-
mentation technology. Start-up is scheduled for mid-2019.
The highly concentrated algal oil produced by Veramaris will
enable the animal feed industry to keep pace with rising
demand for these essential omega-3 fatty acids for the first
time without having to rely on fish oil from stocks of wild fish.

Both investments strengthen the Animal Nutrition growth
engine.

Higher sales

The Resource Efficiency segment’s successful performance
continued in 2018. Sales rose 6 percent to €5,709 million,
driven principally by higher selling prices, partly because
increased raw material prices were passed on, and by the
consolidation of the silica business acquired from Huber as of
September 1, 2017. This was countered by slightly lower
volumes and negative currency effects.

The silica business contributed significantly higher sales.
Alongside eight months including the first-time consolidation
of the Huber business, a very pleasing performance came
from products for the tire industry. Coating additives, which

mainly offer applications solutions for coating technologies,
also generated significantly higher sales. In the business with
high-performance polymers, there was especially high
demand for polyamide 12 products, for example, from the
automotive industry and 3D printing. An improved product
mix and higher prices lifted sales. Crosslinkers, which are
mainly used in environment-friendly paint systems/coatings,
high-performance composites, and specialty plastics, posted a
good performance worldwide and were able to grow sales
thanks to volumes and prices. Oil additives for the automotive,
construction, and transportation industries reported sales on
the prior-year level.

increased to €4,815 million. ROCE was at a very good level of
20.5 percent.

Investment projects to expand market po: ns
A new production facility for high-molecular polyester was
completed at our site in Witten (Germany). As binders for
paints, specialty copolyesters are used in coil coatings and,
increasingly, in food can coatings.

By raising global capacity for precipitated silica, the
Resource Efficiency segment is supporting the growth of its

attractive specialty markets. In North America, a new pro-
duction facility for precipitated silica has been erected in
Charleston (South Carolina, USA), close to almost all major
customers in the tire industry. This involves investment in the
low triple-digit million euro range. We are also increasing
production capacity for precipitated silica in Adapazari
(Turkey) by 2020. Precipitated silica is a fast-growing product
that is mainly used in high-quality tires with low rolling resis-
tance. Other areas of application are the food, feed, and
agriculture industries.

In Antwerp (Belgium), the Resource Efficiency segment
is investing a sum in the high double-digit million euro range
to extend capacity for fumed silica. This production complex
is scheduled to come into service in summer 2019. Typical
applications for this specialty silica, which Evonik markets as
AEROSIL®, are paints, coatings, modern adhesive systems,
transparent silicones, and non-combustible high-performance
insulating materials. Precipitated and fumed silicas belong to
the Smart Materials growth engine.

In response to rapidly rising demand, we are planning a
new production complex for the specialty polymer polyamide 12
(PA 12) in Marl (Germany), which is scheduled to start op-
erating in early 2021. Thanks to its outstanding properties—
high stability combined with flexibility, as well as high tem-
perature resistance and low weight—this high-performance
polymer is used as a substitute for steel in many demanding
applications: in automotive and lightweight engineering, and in
oil and gas pipelines. In addition, it is used medical applications
and in 3D printing. This investment also strengthens the
Smart Materials growth engine.

In addition, on November 7, 2018, we signed an agreement
to acquire the US company PeroxyChem! as an extension to
our specialty products for the active oxygen business.

Higher sales
Sales grew 6 percent to €3,976 million in the Performance
Materials segment. This was attributable to a significant rise
in selling prices, primarily as a consequence of higher raw
material costs. The increase in sales was held back by negative
currency effects. Transportation restrictions caused by the
low water level in the river Rhine resulted in a drop in volumes.
Methacrylates once again posted a good performance and
sales were significantly higher. Demand remained high, espe-
cially from the coatings and automotive sectors, while supply
on the market was tight. We registered pleasing growth in
attractive specialty applications, e.g., for medical technology
and the automotive sector. In this market environment, business
focused specifically on attractive applications. Sales of per-

The Services segment generates sales both internally, with
the specialty chemicals segments and the corporate center
(2018: €2,247 million), and with external customers. External
sales fell 6 percent to €677 million. This was mainly due to
lower revenues from procurement for external customers at
our sites. Adjusted EBITDA rose 10 percent to €146 million.

2.7 Regional development

A global presence
We increased sales in all regions in 2018. 83 percent of our
sales were generated outside Germany.

Sales in Western Europe rose 3 percent year-on-year to
€6,397 million, driven principally by our Nutrition & Care and
Resource Efficiency growth segments, but the Performance
Materials also posted higher sales. Western Europe accounted
for 43 percent of Group sales.

Investment was once again concentrated on Western
Europe. Nevertheless, capital expenditures in this region
were below the previous year’s high level at €480 million
compared with €576 million. A new production facility for
high-quality flat films made from multi-layer polymethyl-
methacrylate (PMMA) came on stream at our site in Weiterstadt
(Germany). A production plant for high-molecular polyester
was completed in Witten (Germany). Capacity for fumed silicas
will be increased in Antwerp (Belgium) by summer 2019. In
Marl (Germany), we are planning a new production complex
for the specialty polymer polyamide 12. This is scheduled to
start operating in early 2021.

In Eastern Europe, sales increased 13 percent to €947 mil-
lion. The Nutrition & Care and Resource Efficiency segments

This was principally due to higher earnings from utilities,
waste management, and site management.

Capital expenditures in this segment decreased by 9 percent
to €148 million and therefore exceeded depreciation and
amortization, which amounted to €127 million.

both reported above-average sales rises. This region’s share
of Group sales was unchanged at 6 percent.

In the Middle East & Africa region, sales rose 3 percent to
€435 million, which was 3 percent of Group sales.

Higher sales in the Americas
Sales in North America were 3 percent higher at €3,409 million.
In addition to the first-time consolidation of sales from the
Huber silica business, which was acquired on September 1,
2017, this was driven primarily by the good development of
the Performance Materials segment. This region's share of
total sales was unchanged at 23 percent. Capital expenditures
were €213 million, which was below the previous year’s level
(€254 million). We completed a new production facility for
precipitated silicas in Charleston (South Carolina, USA) and
converted capacity in Chester (Pennsylvania, USA) for these
products.

Sales declined 13 percent in Central & South America to
€624 million. This region accounted for 4 percent of Group
sales.

2.8 Earnings position

Considerable year-on-year rise in income

before income taxes, continuing operations

Sales grew 4 percent to €15.0 billion, principally as a result of
higher selling prices and initial consolidation of the silica
business acquired from Huber effective September 1, 2017.
Negative exchange rate movements had a counter-effect.
The rise in the cost of sales was driven mainly by consolida-
tion of the new businesses and the increase in raw material
costs. The higher selling expenses were mainly due to the
expansion of our business. Research and development expenses

Income statement for the Evonik Group

declined, partly as a result of more targeted alignment of
R&D activities. General administrative expenses were lower,
mainly as a result of successful measures to reduce costs. In
2017, other operating income contained income in connection
with the dissolution of a joint operation. The other operating
expenses contained higher restructuring expenses but lower
expenses for the purchase of equity investments. Income
before financial result and income taxes was 12 percent higher
at €1,367 million, principally because of the better operating
performance.

cent to €1,202 million. Income taxes declined, mainly due to
non-period tax income and the remeasurement of deferred

taxes. Non-controlling interests in after-tax income com-
prised the pro rata profits and losses of fully consolidated
subsidiaries that are attributable to shareholders outside the
Evonik Group.

Net income was 31 percent higher at €932 million, mainly
because of the better operating performance.

2.9 Financial condition

Central financial management

The principal objectives of financial management are safe-
guarding the financial independence of the Evonik Group and
limiting financial risks. We therefore apply a central financing
strategy. Borrowing and bond issuance are normally undertaken
by Evonik Industries AG or its financing company, Evonik
Finance B.V., Amsterdam (Netherlands). The liabilities of this
company are fully guaranteed by Evonik Industries AG. To
reduce external borrowing, surplus liquidity at Group compa-
nies is placed in a cash pool at Group level to cover financing
requirements in other Group companies through intragroup
loans. Currency derivatives are used at Group level to hedge
intragroup loans. Evonik has a flexible range of corporate
financing instruments to meet liquidity requirements for day-
to-day business, investments, and the repayment of financial
debt.

Solid investment grade rating confirmed

Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's (S&P) confirmed their
credit ratings for Evonik Industries AG in 2018. Moody's
rating is still Baal and S&P still rates Evonik BBB+, with a
stable outlook in both cases. Maintaining a solid investment
grade rating is a central element in our financing strategy. In
this way we gain access to a broad investor base on appropriate
financing terms and thus maintain our financial flexibility. A
solid investment grade rating gives banks, investors, customers,
and suppliers a reliable basis for a long-term business relation-
ship with Evonik.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Good free cash flow

The free cash flow rose by €161 million to €672 million. It
includes cash outflows of around €15 million in connection
with the current restructuring programs.

The increase in the free cash flow mainly resulted from
the higher cash flow from operating activities, which was
€1,704 million, exceeding the prior-year level by €153 million.
The main influence here was the better operating result,
while the increase in net working capital had a negative
effect.

The cash flow from other investing activities comprised an
outflow of €10 million. The prior-year outflow of €4,141 million
mainly related to outflows for the purchase of subsidiaries.

The cash outflow of €676 million for financing activities was
principally due to the dividend payment of €536 million for
2017.

Liquidity position remains strong

As of December 31, 2018, Evonik had cash and cash equiva-
lents amounting to €988 million. Alongside cash and cash
equivalents and investments in current securities, Evonik’s
central source of liquidity is a €1.75 billion revolving credit
facility. Following exercise of the first extension option in
June 2018, the credit facility agreed in June 2017 now runs
until June 2023, with a further option to extend it by one year
to June 2024 at the latest. This credit facility was not utilized
in 2018 and does not contain any covenants requiring Evonik
to meet specific financial ratios.

In addition, there are various credit lines to meet local
requirements, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. As of
December 31, 2018, €495 million of the total amount had not
been drawn.

Solid funding of pension obligations

Pension provisions account for about half of our total debt.
They are non-current and depend on the discount rate.
Applying a constant discount rate, pension provisions declined
by €85 million compared with year-end 2017 to €3,732 mil-
lion. The funding of pension obligations’ was 69 percent as
of the reporting date, a solid level in line with the industry
norm.

Major projects completed or virtually completed in 2018

Slightly lower capital expenditures
Investment projects are aimed at utilizing potential for sus-
tained profitable growth and value creation. In the specialty
chemicals sector Evonik is therefore expanding in business
areas and markets where it already has—or intends to build—a
strong competitive position. Every project is required to
undergo detailed strategic and economic analyses. All projects
have to meet our minimum return requirement, which is set at
our cost of capital. We take a flexible and disciplined approach
to extending our leading market positions. All projects are
regularly reviewed for changes in the market situation.
Capital expenditures? were slightly lower than in the
previous year at €1,050 million (2017: €1,078 million).? The
highest proportion of capital expenditures went to the Nutrition
& Care and Resource Efficiency segments (46 percent and
28 percent, respectively). A further 14 percent was allocated to
the Performance Materials segment and the Services segment
received 11 percent. The regional focus of capital expenditures
was Western Europe, which accounted for 46 percent of the
total, followed by Asia-Pacific South (29 percent), North
America (20 percent), and Asia-Pacific North (4 percent).

FINANCIAL REPORT 2018 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Evonik Industries AG, Essen (Germany) is the parent company
of the Evonik Group. Its registered office is in Essen (Germany)
and it holds direct and indirect stakes in all subsidiaries in the
Evonik Group. The annual financial statements for Evonik
Industries AG have been prepared in accordance with the
accounting standards set out in the German Commercial
Code (HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

The earnings performance of Evonik Industries AG is essen-
tially dependent on income from its subsidiaries, income and
expenses relating to corporate financing, and portfolio
management activities. Financial management is therefore
based on an earnings indicator that contains all these effects:
net income.

Distributable profit 536 770

The 6 percent rise in sales to €705 million was principally
attributable to higher selling prices as increases in raw material
prices were passed on. Accordingly, the cost of materials rose
7 percent to €263 million. Personnel expense was €415 million,
an increase of €49 million compared with the prior year. This
increase was mainly attributable to the establishment of pro-
visions in connection with the SG&A 2020 program to reduce
administrative and selling expenses. Other operating income
declined to €484 million, mainly due to the income from cur-
rency translation gains. In the gross presentation, currency
translation gains of €420 million (2017: €910 million) are
shown in other operating income, while the corresponding
currency translation losses of €419 million (2017: €914 million)
are shown separately in other operating expense. The net
effect was a gain of €1 million (2017: loss of €4 million).
Income from investments fell 32 percent to €564 million.
This decline was mainly due to lower income from profit-
and-loss transfer agreements, which was caused primarily by

negative effects from the measurement of pension assets at
the subsidiaries concerned. The write-downs of financial
assets and current securities totaling €15 million and write-
ups of financial assets and current securities totaling €11 mil-
lion related to affiliated companies. In the previous year,
write-ups on financial assets amounted to €149 million.

Net interest expense was €136 million, well below the
previous year’s net interest expense of €43 million. This was
mainly caused by interest expense in connection with the
valuation of pension assets, and the interest effect of the valu-
ation of provisions for pensions and similar commitments
based on the 2018 revision of the biometric data in the 2018 G
mortality tables published by Klaus Heubeck. In 2017, the
valuation of pension assets resulted in interest income. This item
also contains interest income and expense from the group-wide
cash pool, which is concentrated at Evonik Industries AG.

assets mainly comprise shares in subsidiaries. The receivables
are mainly financial receivables of €3.6 billion (2017: €3.0 bil-
lion), principally in connection with loans and cash pooling
activities.

Equity decreased by €0.6 billion to €6.0 billion, mainly as
a consequence of the dividend payment for 2017 and the net
loss. The equity ratio declined from 48.7 percent in 2017 to
44.0 percent. Provisions increased from €0.6 billion to

€0.8 billion, mainly as a consequence of interest effects on
provisions for pensions and an increase in other provisions.
The receivables and payables reflect the financing activities of
Evonik Industries AG in its role as the holding company for
the Evonik Group. Payables include financial liabilities of
€6.6 billion (2017: €6.1 billion). €4.8 billion (2017: €4.2 billion)
of this amount comprises liabilities to affiliated companies,
principally in connection with cash pooling activities. A further
€1.8 billion (2017: €1.8 billion) relates to corporate bonds.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2018 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Opportunities and risks

The most significant operating subsidiaries in Germany have
profit-and-loss transfer agreements with Evonik Industries
AG. In line with the central financing strategy of the Evonik
Group, most internal and external financing transactions are
handled by Evonik Industries AG. Consequently, Evonik
Industries AG is essentially exposed to the same risks and
opportunities as the Evonik Group. Further information can
be found in the opportunity and risk report.

Outlook’ for 2019

We anticipate that in 2019 Evonik Industries AG will report
slightly higher earnings than in 2018, and anticipate that net
income will be positive. This is based on the assumption of
attractive income from investments. By contrast, given the
low interest rates, effects relating to pension provisions could
have a negative impact.

Report on relations with affiliated companies

A report on Evonik Industries AG's relations with affiliated
companies has been prepared in accordance with section 312 of
the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). It concludes with
the following declaration: “Our company received adequate
remuneration or compensation for each of the transactions
set out in this report on relations with affiliated companies
under the circumstances known to us at the time when the
transactions were undertaken. No actions were performed or
omitted at the instigation of such companies.”

FINANCIAL REPORT 2018 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Our vision for Evonik: leading in innovation

The link between innovative capacity and closeness to cus-
tomers is a key success factor for Evonik and drives profitable
growth. Within the growth engines of relevance for Evonik—
Specialty Additives, Animal Nutrition, Smart Materials, and
Health & Care—we identify future-oriented innovation growth
fields in highly attractive markets with above-average growth
rates, which we use to achieve our ambitious targets. Our
vision is to be an innovation leader.

We work with customers and external partners across
business boundaries and provide incentives for new discoveries
so that good ideas can be turned into marketable innovations.
Through strategic investment we aim to commercialize the
findings of these growth fields faster and more profitably.

Research and development (R&D) in our strategic innovation

unit, Creavis, and in our growth segments is aligned to six

innovation growth fields:

+ Sustainable Nutrition: establishing additional products
and services for sustainable nutrition of livestock and people

+ Healthcare Solutions: developing new materials for
implants, as components of cell culture media, and for
custom-tailored, innovative drug formulations

+ Advanced Food Ingredients: creating a portfolio of
health-enhancing substances and nutritional supplements
as a contribution to healthy nutrition

+ Membranes: extending SEPURAN® technology for effi-
cient gas separation to further applications

+ Cosmetic Solutions: developing further products based
on natural sources for cosmetics and sensorially optimized
formulations for skin care products

+ Additive Manufacturing: developing products and technol-
ogies for additive manufacturing

A pleasing example from the Cosmetic Solutions innovation
growth field is the good market development of new prod-
ucts with sustainability features. We received awards for
RHEANCE® One: a novel ingredient developed by our Per-
sonal Care business. This glycolipid cleansing agent for skin
and hair is produced from sugar using a fermentation process
without tropical oils.

An example from the Sustainable Nutrition innovation
growth field is the Veramaris joint venture, which grew out
of the successful research collaboration between the Nutrition
& Care segment and DMS, and is examining the production
of omega-3 fatty acids from algae.

Other strategic investments in this innovation growth field
were made in the precision livestock farming program. The
acquisition of Porphyrio NV, a spin-off of KU Leuven based in
Herent (Belgium), was completed in October 2018. Porphyrio
is a leading supplier of big data solutions for livestock farming.
Through our venture capital unit, we invested in the start-up
OPTIFARM Ltd., Great Chesterford (UK), and the biotech-
nology start-up In Ovo, Leiden (Netherlands). Both investments
enable us to help customers improve their performance and
sustainability, and strengthen our Animal Nutrition growth
engine.

Successful innovation management

Evonik has an extensive patent strategy to protect new prod-
ucts and processes. The value and quality of our patent
portfolio has increased steadily in recent years. In 2018, we
submitted around 240 new patent applications. Patent-driven
sales' accounted for around 50 percent of our total sales. In
2018, products and applications introduced in the past five
years accounted for 12 percent of Evonik’s consolidated sales.
The significant increase compared with 2017 (10 percent) is
attributable to innovations from the businesses acquired and
to initial market successes from our innovation growth fields.
R&D expenses declined by 4 percent to €459 million in 2018
as a result of target-oriented management.

Our R&D projects are managed using the multi-step
Idea-to-Profit process developed by Evonik to support the
systematic development of projects right up to profitable
commercialization.

Our innovation pipeline addresses completely new business
options as well as activities to secure and enhance the prospects
of existing business operations. Alongside product and process
innovations, the focus includes innovative business models
and product and process innovations. Our project portfolio is
aligned to the differing strategies of the various business
entities.

Targeted research and development

Around 90 percent of our R&D is performed by our segments.
That includes, first and foremost, research geared specifically
to their core technologies and markets and to the develop-
ment of new business. An above-average proportion of our
R&D funding is allocated to our growth segments: Nutrition
& Care and Resource Efficiency. The Performance Materials
segment focuses on optimizing products and processes.

Creavis concentrates on mid- and long-term innovation proj-
ects that support Evonik’s growth and sustainability strategy
and provide access to new business options. In addition, it
identifies future-oriented topics and acts as an internal incu-
bator for Evonik. Work on innovation projects of a cross-
organizational nature is organized in project houses. Experts
from the organizational units involved in a project house
normally work together for a period of three years on the
project house’s development topics. Since April 2018, the
Medical Devices project house has been driving forward
seven promising projects as a competence center within the
Health Care business line. The newly established Tissue
Engineering project house located at the R&D hub in Singa-
pore is currently working on new solutions to grow living
cells on a scaffold material. Its work supports the Healthcare
Solutions innovation growth field. The aim is to develop
materials for biological implants for medical applications.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Since the start of 2018, Evonik and Siemens have been work-
ing together on artificial photosynthesis through the “Rheticus”
project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and
Science. The aim is to use electricity from renewable resources
and bacteria to convert carbon dioxide into specialty chemicals.
A first pilot plant is under construction at our site in Marl
(Germany).

Evonik also obtains access to innovative technologies and
new business options through its corporate venture capital
activities. We invest specifically in specialized technology
funds and start-ups of strategic relevance to Evonik. In this
way, we gain insights into innovative developments at a very
early stage. We have made more than 24 investments since
2012. In addition to investments to strengthen the Sustainable
Nutrition growth field, in 2018 Evonik invested, among
others, in Velox Puredigital Ltd, Rosh Ha’Ayin (Israel). Velox
has new digital printing technology that allows top-quality
printing of metal, plastic, or glass packaging, either in extremely
small series or on an industrial scale. This opens up opportu-
nities for the Coating Additives business line to partner with
Velox on the development of customized additive solutions
for the growing packaging industry market.

Evonik aims to be the digitalization leader in the chemical
industry. With this in mind, in 2018 we invested in the US
high-tech start-up mySkin Inc., Jersey City (New Jersey,
USA), which is facilitating a breakthrough in how consumers
can determine and improve their skin properties. The company
has developed a mobile device that analyzes skin properties
and recommends care products.

A culture of innovation is a key factor in a company’s innova-
tive capability. Alongside commitment, passion, and stamina,
that entails the strength to halt R&D projects if their pros-
pects of success are too low, as well as a constructive attitude
to mistakes. We therefore regard Evonik as an open, learning
company.

MANAGEMENT REPORT

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Responsible corporate management

Sustainability is part of Evonik’s market proposition. Our prod-
ucts and solutions are used in many areas that help to improve
people's lives and minimize the use of scarce resources. In this
way, we also aim to play our part in the United Nations’ 17
Sustainable Development Goals, to be achieved by 2030. In
the reporting period, we examined the SDGs and their rele-
vance for the Evonik Group on various levels.

Evonik is committed to observing internationally recognized
standards and its own more far-reaching guidelines and prin-
ciples of conduct. That includes, for example, the ten principles
of the UN Global Compact. In addition, we are guided by the
International Labour Standards issued by the International
Labour Organization (ILO) and the Guidelines for Multina-
tional Enterprises published by the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD). Evonik is involved
in many networks such as the Chemie? sustainability initiative
of the German chemical industry, and the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Together
with our code of conduct, our global social policy (GSP) and
our environment, safety, health, and quality (ESHQ) values
provide a framework for responsible corporate management.

Sustainability strategy defined in more detail

We are convinced that sustainable and responsible business
activities are vital for the future of companies. In view of this,
we defined our sustainability strategy in more detail in 2018,
especially as regards foresighted resource management and
integrating sustainability into strategic management processes.

Intensive dialogue with stakeholders

Dialogue with our stakeholders is important to give us a better
understanding of different perspectives and regularly review
our own positions. Findings and impetus from our stakeholder
dialogues facilitate timely identification of upcoming market
developments, trends, opportunities, and risks. That enables
us to customize our products and solutions to meet the needs
of our customers and markets.

1 APARC comprises a product used for a defined application in a specific region.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

We use a variety of formats for dialogue with our stakeholders.
In 2018, that included, for example, an exchange of experience
on the future of Europe with selected representatives of science,
business, and non-governmental organizations. The motto
for the Evonik Perspectives forum, which was attended by
around 150 stakeholders, was “The two-degree goal—How
industry can help meet climate targets.”

Extensive review of the materiality analysis
Feedback from our dialogue with stakeholders was also used
in the review of our materiality analysis. Based on the opinions
of more than 400 stakeholders and internal experts, the most
important sustainability topics for Evonik are more sustainable
products/solutions for our customers, climate change and
emissions into the air, and more efficient use of scarce
resources/circular economy. We will be stepping up our
focus on these topics in the future.

Further development of sustainability

analysis methodology

Sustainability is an important criterion in many of our markets
and is increasingly becoming a growth driver. Our sustainabil-
ity analysis makes the contribution made by corresponding
products and services to our business performance measur-
able. In 2018, we continued to develop the method used for
this analysis and had it validated externally. We now analyze
our business activities using the WBCSD method at the level of
PARCs'. Each PARC comprises a product used for a defined
application in a specific region.

Continuous improvement of

sustainability reporting

Our reporting is focused on measurability and transparency
and we have brought forward the publication date of our sus-
tainability report? to coincide with publication of the financial
report and the separate non-financial report®. Evonik has a
good position in leading ratings and is included in major
sustainability-oriented index families.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2018 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

5.1 Employees

Employees are the foundations of our success
Skilled and motivated employees are the key to Evonik’s
success. By providing an attractive working environment, we
want to ensure that our employees like to work for Evonik
and can develop their talents. We foster the creativity of our
employees and offer them space to take their own route to
innovative solutions. We want to create an atmosphere based
on trust, respect, and openness. We reward performance and
readiness to take risks and we develop our own managers.

This is reflected in our human resources strategy, which is
divided into the following areas of action: attract, develop,
perform, retain, and lead.

Attract

Employer branding—Positioning as an

attractive employer

We seek out creative and competent employees with high
potential and offer them a working environment that fosters
ideas, offers creative freedom, and supports the combinability
of work and private life. We also use these employer qualities
in the competition to attract the best employees and managers
to Evonik.

In our employer branding campaign, #HumanChemistry,
employees from various regions share their experience and
perspectives of working at Evonik. A sharp rise in the number
of visitors to our careers site shows that reaching out to the
target groups in this way achieves a good response. Evonik
received the Leading Employer 2018 award in Germany and
is the best employer in the chemical sector. In the overall
ranking of over 70,000 companies, Evonik is ranked 22nd.

Develop
Further training to secure the future
We want to ensure timely identification of the potential of our
employees and talents and to foster, develop, and stretch
employees accordingly. Our learning and personnel develop-
ment strategy is aligned to future business requirements.
Digitalization is the central focus of our strategic objectives.
An important new feature was the development of a learning
strategy in collaboration with our employees. This resulted in
two offerings: the Global Development Portal (GDP) as a
central platform for all learning needs, and the Learning and
Individualized Library (LILY), which provides constant access to
learning resources. Our learning strategy and offerings were
honored with the Gold Excellence Award 2018 for learning
and development in Asia.

We invested around €17 million in the continuing profes-
sional development of our employees in 2018.

Vocational training for present and future specialists
We want to continue to recruit specialists specifically from
young people within the company, and are committed to
their development. All employees hired on unlimited contracts
following successful completion of their vocational training
are offered a clear perspective for the future.

In 2018, Evonik trained around 1,800 young people, includ-
ing about 400 on behalf of other companies. Our training
covered 33 recognized vocational training courses and
combined vocational training and study programs at 16 sites.
In 2018, 90 places for young people who were not yet ready
for an apprenticeship were taken up on the “Start in den
Beruf” pre-apprenticeship program. That figure includes the
training initiative of the Evonik Foundation, which financed
40 places, including 20 for young refugees. In connection
with the MATCHING 2020 internship program, for which
RAG-Stiftung is providing funding of €1.35 million, Evonik
will be creating 1,500 additional internships by 2020 to support
young people in their career choices.

Apprentices accounted for around 6.8 percent of our
workforce in Germany, which is still well above the national
average of around 5 percent.’ In all, we invested €63 million
in vocational training of employees. In 2018, we were once
again singled out as one of the best vocational training com-
panies in Germany for the quality of our training.

Talent management—Developing tomorrow’s
executives and experts

Key positions are filled predominantly by talented employees
from within the company. To this end, we develop employees
with potential across hierarchical levels, functions, and organi-
zational units. Important objectives for talent development at
Evonik are personal responsibility, diversity, internationality,
flexibility / mobility, and a business mindset.

The development of future senior executives is organized
as a structured process at Evonik. Job rotation, evaluation of
potential, and succession scenarios are discussed and analyzed
in detail at regular personnel conferences attended by members
of the executive board. Alongside ongoing development,
Evonik works with the International Institute for Management
Development in Lausanne (Switzerland). Together, we run
programs for various groups of talents. The focus is on content
of direct relevance to the business and on day-to-day
management requirements. We support the personal develop-
ment of executives using formats that center on personal
motivation, attitudes, and the assumption of social responsibility.

Progressive digitalization of working processes
Flexibilization and individualization, digitalization and net-
working are bringing massive changes to how we work. In
order to utilize the resultant opportunities, Evonik systematically
taps into employees’ ideas and experience.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Employees

People are at the heart of the digital transformation at Evonik.
#HumanWork provides cross-unit support, e.g., for the digi-
talization initiatives of the segments, regions, and service
units, including New Work Labs to test new forms of working.
Here, employees can try out alternative forms of working and
collaboration on a voluntary basis for a limited period. When
the lab phase ends, a decision will be taken on whether the
working model can be rolled out either group-wide or for
specific parts of the Evonik organization. In addition,
#HumanWork provides access to new working and learning
formats such as the agile method, design thinking, and working
out loud. It also promotes use of collaborative in-house tools.

Perform

We regard a healthy performance culture as the basis for the
company’s success and the personal motivation of every indi-
vidual employee. Fair, performance-related remuneration
plays a central role in this, together with employees’ annual
performance and development review with their manager.

Remuneration—Performance-related pay around

the world

When shaping remuneration systems, Evonik believes it is
very important to offer specialists and executives market-
oriented and performance-related salaries. The remuneration of
almost all members of our workforce includes bonus payments
that are based on the company’s business performance and/
or their personal performance. In 2018, Evonik’s bonus system
was aligned more clearly to our strategic financial targets,
e.g., profitability, growth, and liquidity.

In addition, in 2019 we plan to revise our global perfor-
mance management for employees in management functions.
The new approach should be more flexible and less bureau-
cratic for both managers and their employees. Regular feedback
discussions and clear evaluation of individual performance
will support the cultural change at Evonik and the establishment
of our new corporate values. In addition, we offer employees
in Germany, the USA, China, Belgium, and Singapore the
opportunity to take part in the “Share” employee share pro-
gram. The participation rate remained high at 39 percent in
2018.

Retain

Diversity enriches

Evonik does business in many markets worldwide. Diversity
is therefore normal in our business activities. Employees with
different backgrounds and personalities enrich our teams and
our company. That makes diversity a key to Evonik’s economic
success because it enhances our creativity, innovative capability,
and proximity to customers.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Fostering diversity is a central requirement for every manage-
ment function at Evonik. Our diversity strategy contains clear
targets. We want to increase the proportion of women in our
company at all levels worldwide. In the recruitment process
for management functions, we are guided by the gender
distribution of the academic disciplines with relevance for us. In
accordance with German law on equal participation of women
and men in management positions, at Evonik Industries AG
we have set a target of 20 percent female managers for the
top two management levels below the executive board.

As a global company, it is particularly important to us to
ensure that our workforce includes a broad spectrum of
different nationalities. Around 42 percent of employees in
management functions come from countries other than
Germany. Group-wide, the proportion in mid-management is
23.2 percent.

Work-life balance

Evonik’s HR policy is family-friendly and geared to different
phases in people’s lives. Therefore, it is important to us that
our employees find a balance between work and their private
lives. We offer corresponding initiatives for more than 93 per-
cent of our employees worldwide. These include flexible
worktime models, support for people caring for close relatives,
and assistance with childcare. We also have wide-ranging offers
to foster the physical and mental fitness of our employees.
Many of our sites around the world offer a variety of sports
activities.

Employee satisfaction at a good level

We conducted our fifth group-wide employee survey in
November 2018. The participation rate was over 85 percent,
which was above the participation rate in the previous survey
in 2015. The commitment index, which is an indicator of both
commitment to the company and personal engagement, was
lower than in the 2015 survey, but only slightly below the
benchmark comprising a sample of other companies. Reasons
include a sense of uncertainty felt by individual employees as
a result of far more active portfolio management across the
Evonik Group and further optimization of administration. In
addition, the results highlight possible scope for improvement
in group-wide collaboration. Following a detailed analysis of the
results of the survey, we intend to work out specific measures
in the first half of 2019.

Culture and leadership

Focus on an earnings-oriented corporate culture

The heart of our leadership culture is a trustful relationship
between employees and managers. Here we focus on three
dimensions: clear instructions, consistent action, and a coop-
erative approach to our employees.

One central task for Evonik’s executives is cultural change
in the company. Based on our four new corporate values—
performance, trust, openness, and speed—which were posi-
tioned by the top management at an executive conference in
2018, the responsibility lies with executives. The top-down
rollout started in 2018 and executives will start the dialogue
with employees in 2019. The results of the employee survey
will be used in this process.

5.2 Safety and environment

Safety as a management task

We take our responsibility in the field of safety particularly
seriously—during production and while shipping products to
our customers. Our objective is to protect our employees and
local residents as well as the environment from any potential
negative impact of our activities. The group-wide Safety at
Evonik initiative has become firmly established as an ongoing
process to develop our safety culture and as a fundamental

Headcount hardly changed

At year-end 2018, the Evonik Group had 36,043 employees,
a slight drop of 480 compared with year-end 2017. This was
principally due to implementation of the program to optimize
administrative functions and some smaller optimization
efforts in our chemical segments. At the same time, the
reduction was countered by investment in growth projects in
the Nutrition & Care and Resource Efficiency segments.

Safety and environment

Our overriding aim is to avoid all accidents and incidents. We
set annual limits for occupational safety and plant safety indi-
cators.

For 2019 these are unchanged:
+ The accident frequency rate should not exceed 1.30.
+ The incident frequency rate should not exceed 1.10.

Incident frequency indicator improved considerably
and was within the defined limit

A special focus of our initiative is the safety of our employ-
ees—both at work and on the way to and from work—and
the safety of contractors working at our sites. In 2018, the
accident frequency indicator’ for our employees was 0.87,
which was within our defined maximum limit of 1.30. That
was a slight improvement compared with the previous year
(1.16). Discussing the accidents provided valuable pointers
for future accident prevention, and these have been commu-
nicated to our employees.

Accident frequency indicator C23

2016 1.24
2017 1.16
2018 0.37
0.0 0.5 1.0 15 2.0

There were no fatal accidents at work involving our employ-
ees or contractors’ employees in the reporting period, nor
were there any fatal traffic accidents involving employees on
the way to or from work or on business trips.

The accident frequency rate for contractors’ employees
was 2.77, which was considerably lower than in 2017 (3.52).?

Incident frequency indicator at a very good level
Process safety at our plants is another focus of our initiative. The
concepts to prevent fire and the release of hazardous substances
are regularly analyzed in detail. The aim is timely identification
of risks so we can develop appropriate measures that reliably
prevent these risks. We monitor and evaluate plant safety using
the incident frequency indicator?. The incident frequency
indicator improved slightly to 1.08 in 2018 and therefore
remained below the upper limit we defined. The development
of the incident frequency indicator over the past three years
shows that the measures introduced are having a long-term
effect.

Ambitious environmental targets

Protecting our environment and the climate are major global
challenges of our age. Maintaining the natural basis of life for
future generations is part of our corporate responsibility.
That includes steadily reducing emissions and continuously
improving the efficient use of materials and resources.

As a specialty chemicals company, we are aware that our
production impacts the environment. Our materiality analysis
confirms the issues of relevance for the environment area of
action, especially climate change and emissions into the air,
water management, waste management, and biodiversity.

We also develop products that contribute to forging a
clear link between economic success and ecological progress.

We have set demanding environmental targets for the period
2013-2020 (reference base: 2012):

+ Reduce specific greenhouse gas emissions* by 12 percent.
+ Reduce specific water intake® by 10 percent.

A further reduction in production waste was set as an addi-
tional target.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2018 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

The 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions com-
pared with the reference base (2012) was in line with the very
good level achieved in the previous year.

The water required for our production operations is princi-
pally for once-through cooling at established plants. The
amount of surface water required for this in 2018 increased as
a result of the long period of hot, dry weather in Germany
and Belgium. At the same time, water requirements in China
decreased due to some production stoppages. Taking 2012 as
the basis, our total specific water intake was 1 percentage
point lower than in 2017.

Total hazardous and non-hazardous production waste
declined by 1 percent to 393,000 metric tons in 2018. This
was due, among other things, to a reduction in sewage
sludge in Antwerp (Belgium) and higher availability of the
sulfuric acid cracking plant in Marl (Germany).

Evonik’s present environmental targets end in 2020. We
therefore defined new environmental targets in the reporting
period. We are aiming for a 50 percent reduction in absolute
scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025, compared with the level in
2008 (status of implementation in 2018: 30 percent). That
affirms our commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate
Change. The relatively short target period up to 2025 reflects
our view that it is not currently possible to predict technolo-
gical and regulatory developments beyond this period with
sufficient certainty.

We are continuing to pursue our goal of a group-wide
reduction in specific water intake, but we are replacing the
central indicator by introducing a global water management
system and driving forward the related site-specific action
plans.

Slight increase in greenhouse gas emissions

due to acquisitions

Production output was 11.0 million metric tons, the same as in
the previous year. The 1 percent increase in scope 1 greenhouse
gas emissions to 5.69 million metric tons CO, equivalents
was mainly due to the increase in natural gas resulting from
first-time inclusion! of the Huber silica business. The sum of
scope 1 and net scope 2 (market-based) greenhouse gas
emissions also increased by 1 percent to 6.57 million metric
tons CO, equivalents in 2018. Scope 2 emissions are reported
on a net basis by deducting electricity and steam sold to third
parties from the electricity and steam produced for captive
use.

The 30 facilities operated by Evonik that fall within the
scope of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) emitted
3.9 million metric tons of CO, in 2018 (2017: 3.8 million metric
tons CO,).

FINANCIAL REPORT 2018 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

6.1 Opportunity and risk management

Risk strategy

Evonik's group-wide internal opportunity and risk management
(referred to generically as risk management in this section)
forms a central element in the management of the company.
Our risk management includes an early risk detection system,
which meets the requirements for publicly listed companies.
The aims are to identify risks as early as possible and to define
measures to counter and minimize them. To ensure optimal
use is made of opportunities, these also need to be recognized
and tracked from an early stage. We only enter into entrepre-
neurial risks if we are convinced that in this way we can
generate a sustained rise in the value of the company and, at the
same time, permanently limit possible negative implications.

Structure and organization of risk management

At Group level, risk management is assigned to the chief
financial officer and is organized on a decentralized basis in
line with Evonik’s organizational structure.

The segments, corporate divisions, and service units bear
prime responsibility for risk management. That comprises
early identification of risks and estimating their implications.
Furthermore, suitable preventive and control measures have
to be introduced and internal communication of risks must be
ensured. Risk coordinators in the organizational units are re-
sponsible for organizing the relevant risk management activities.
At all levels in the Group, systematic and timely risk reporting
is a key element in strategic and operational planning, the
preparation of investment decisions, projections, and other
management and decision-making processes.

A central corporate risk officer coordinates and oversees
the processes and systems. The corporate risk officer is the
contact for all risk coordinators and is responsible for infor-
mation, documentation, and coordination at Group level.
Further responsibilities include ongoing development of the
methodology used by the risk management system. The risk
committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and com-
posed of representatives of the corporate divisions. It validates
the group-wide risk situation and verifies that it is adequately
reflected in financial reporting. The supervisory board, espe-
cially the audit committee, oversees the risk management
system.

In 2018, risk management again included all consolidated
companies in the Evonik Group. At companies where we do
not exert a controlling influence, we implement our risk
management requirements primarily through our presence in
management and supervisory bodies.

The internal audit function monitors risk management in our
organizational units to make sure they comply with statutory
and internal requirements and to ensure continuous improve-
ment of risk management. The risk detection system is included
in the annual audit in compliance with the requirements for
listed companies. This audit showed that Evonik’s risk detection
system is suitable for timely identification of risks that could
pose a threat to the company’s survival.

The risk management system is based on the internationally
recognized COSO Enterprise Management standard. It is
implemented through a binding group-wide policy. Individual
risks are systematically identified and managed with the aid
of special risk management software. Their probability of
occurrence and the possible damage (potential impact) are
evaluated and documented, together with their expected
value (product of probability of occurrence and potential
impact). Analogously to current planning, the evaluation is
based on a period of three years (mid-term planning).
Opportunities and risks are defined as positive and negative
deviations from the plan. The relevant indicators include
adjusted EBITDA. In addition, longer-term opportunities and
tisks, including those relating to sustainability, are included.

The organizational units conduct an extensive annual risk
inventory in connection with the mid-term planning process.
They are required to provide details of the measures to be
taken with regard to the risks identified, introduce them
immediately, and track their timely implementation. Internal
management (for example, reporting by the risk committee)
takes a mid-term view. The opportunities and risks identified
are classified as low, moderate, or high (see opportunity and
risk matrix). The evaluation is always based on a net view, in
other words, taking into account risk limitation measures.
Risk limitation measures can reduce, transfer, or avoid gross
risks. Common measures include economic counteraction,
insurance, and the establishment of provisions on the balance
sheet.

Probability of occurrence

The risk inventory is supplemented by quarterly reviews of
all opportunities and risks relating to the present year, both to
spot changes in the opportunities and risks that have already
been identified and to identify new risks and opportunities.

6.2 Overall assessment of opportun

Given the measures planned and implemented, no risks have
been identified that—either individually or in conjunction with
other risks—could jeopardize the continued existence of Evonik
as a whole, including Evonik Industries AG in its role as the
holding company for the Evonik Group.

For 2018, we expected more risks than opportunities.
Pleasingly, we were able to realize more opportunities than risks
during the year. In the Performance Materials segment, in
particular, we were able to successfully utilize market oppor-
tunities. In the Nutrition & Care and Resource Effi

iency seg-
ments, the opportunities and risks that materialized were
essentially balanced. Our reporting distinguishes between the
categories markets and competition, legal and compliance,
and process and organization. The main parameters influencing
the risk categories in terms of both opportunities realized and
risks that materialized resulted from the development of specific

ks

market and competition situations. From the present standpoint,
the risks for 2019 again outweigh the potential opportunities.
Compared with 2018, there has been a slight increase in the
risks to which Evonik is exposed, while the opportunities
remain constant.

Material individual risks and opportunities for the Evonik
Group are changes in exchange rates and the development of
margins for C4 chemicals. Further material risks relate to the
overall economic development and the increasing threat of
cyber attacks. Measures to reduce the risks include general
economic mitigation measures and, especially with regard to
changes in exchange rates, the use of hedging instruments.
Sections 6.3 and 6.4 present the material individual risks and
opportunities, along with further opportunities and risks in
each category. Except where otherwise indicated, they apply
for all segments.

6.3 Market and competition opportunities and risks

In accordance with our internal management, opportunities
and risks in the market and competition category are allocated
to risk quantification classes within sub-categories. The chart
shows the highest class to which an individual risk or opportu-
nity is allocated in each sub-category. Individual opportunities

and risks may also be allocated to the lower risk classes.
Where two sub-categories have the same profile in the chart,
they are ranked first on the basis of opportunities, then listed
in descending order, based on their expected value.

1. Sales markets

The development of the global economy entails both oppor-
tunities and significant risks for Evonik. If economic growth
strengthens or weakens, for example, due to political develop-
ments, changes in interest rate and exchange rate policy, or the
development of key sectors of the economy (e.g., the banking
and real estate sectors), this can have an impact on demand
in market segments of relevance to Evonik.

An escalation of the trade disputes and a further increase
in the already elevated political risks in the European Union,
including the future economic relations between the European
Union and the United Kingdom after Brexit, could dampen
economic momentum. Furthermore, the monetary policy
tightening by the Federal Reserve in the US could result in a
further reversal of capital flows, which would affect the
emerging markets in particular. Such developments can
already be seen in Argentina, Turkey, and South Africa.

Global economic trends influence the development of
Evonik’s earnings and cash flows. We counter these economic
tisks by constantly monitoring the macroeconomic environ-
ment, optimizing cost structures and competitive positions
in our established areas of business, setting up production
facilities close to our markets, and extending businesses in
our portfolio that have low cyclical exposure.

Alongside the general demand situation, intensive compe-
tition in the various market segments harbors both opportunities
and risks. These may result from either demand in specific
markets or from the competitive situation in various industries.
Changes in demand can have a considerable impact on our
business volume and sales. There are associated opportunities
and risks for our amino business and, to a significant extent,
for our Cy chemicals business. In our market segments, climate
change could also result in both opportunities and risks for
Evonik. There could be a significant hike in the rising demand

from our customers for products that save resources, resulting
in a correspondingly positive impact on our business. Additional
regulations or weather-related incidents could put pressure on
production costs and, at the same time, lead to rising demand
for our resource-efficient products. To reduce the risks, we
monitor the specific developments very carefully and work
closely with our customers on the development of sustainable
solutions.

Competitors in emerging markets and developing countries
can increase competitive pressure through new capacities and
aggressive pricing policies that can impair our selling prices
and volume trends. To counter this we are broadening our
foreign production base and gaining access to new markets in
high-growth regions such as Asia and South America. To
reduce these risks, the operating units affected also use various
methods of increasing customer loyalty and gaining new
customers, enter into research alliances with customers, and
extend the services offered along the value chain.

We are constantly developing attractive and competitive
new products and technologies to mitigate the risk that
chemical products could be replaced by new, improved, or
less expensive materials or technologies. One potential risk
factor for our amino acids business, for example in Asia, is
the possible impact of substandard food quality and food
safety, especially due to bird flu. We utilize opportunities for
profitable future growth by gaining access to new markets as
part of our strategic development. One attractive market for
our amino acids business is aquaculture, for which we have
developed innovative products. As a result of global population
growth, rising affluence in emerging markets, and overfishing
of the world’s oceans, the global aquaculture market is growing
faster than other areas of livestock farming.

MANAGEMENT REPORT

Opportunity and risk report
Market and competition opportunities and risks

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Customer concentration is basically low in our chemicals seg-
ments. None of the end-markets that we supply accounts for
more than 20 percent of sales. Nevertheless, some operational
units, especially in the Nutrition & Care and Resource Efficiency
segments, and the Services segment have a certain depen-
dence on key customers. In the operating business, this applies
in particular to production facilities erected in the direct vicinity
of major customers. The possible loss of a major customer
could result in lower sales and in impairment losses on receiv-
ables and investments, as well as impacting our long-term raw
material agreements or the financial structure of our affiliates.

2. Financial markets

As a tule, liquidity, credit default, currency, and interest rate
risks, and the risks relating to pension obligations, are managed
centrally. All material financial risk positions are identified
and evaluated in accordance with group-wide policies and
principles. This forms the basis for selective hedging to limit
risks. In the use of derivative and non-derivative financial in-
struments to minimize the risks, Evonik applies the principle
of separation of front office, risk controlling, and back office
functions and takes as its guide the banking-specific mini-
mum requirements for risk management (MaRisk) and the
requirements of the German legislation on corporate control
and transparency (KonTraG). Financial derivatives! are only
used in connection with corresponding hedged items.

Exchange rate volatility

Transaction-related exchange rate risks arise from the trans-
lation of operating monetary assets and liabilities on the
balance sheet into the functional currency of the respective
Group company. The resulting net risk is normally hedged in full
using derivatives. Further, our transaction-related currency
management takes account of forecast cash inflows and out-
flows, which are hedged on the basis of forecast transactions,
with a target hedging rate of up to 75 percent. Material oppor-
tunities and risks may arise from the remaining unhedged
items and from discrepancies between the actual future rates
from the average rates used to hedge forecast transactions.
Scenario analyses are performed to estimate and control such
risks and opportunities. These focus on the main foreign
currencies of relevance for the Evonik Group, the US dollar,
Chinese renminbi yuan, and the Singapore dollar. In view of
the rising importance of regions outside the euro zone, risks
and opportunities relating to transactions in foreign currencies
will increase in the long term. In addition, there are currency-
related risks from the translation of separate financial state-
ments. The increasing volatility of exchange rates can be seen

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

in particular in emerging markets, for instance, in Argentina,
which is a hyperinflationary economy, and in Turkey. Economic
risks also arise because exchange rates influence our compe-
titiveness in global markets.

Changes in interest rates

Potential changes in capital market rates result in opportunities
and risks. These comprise, on the one hand, changes in the
fair value of fixed-interest financial instruments and, on the
other, changes in interest payments on variable-rate financial
instruments. To control these risks, when setting interest rate
terms Evonik pays special attention to the structure of the
fixed-floating relationship and uses interest rate swaps for
further optimization where appropriate. Through the use of
fixed-interest loans and interest rate hedging instruments,
79 percent of all financial liabilities were classified as fixed-
interest as of the reporting date, and therefore had no material
exposure to changes in interest rates.

Liquidity risks

To manage the Group's solvency, Evonik uses central liquidity
risk management’. At its heart is a group-wide cash pool. In
addition, Evonik’s financial independence is secured through a
broadly diversified financing structure, a €1.75 billion revolving
credit facility as a central source of liquidity, and our solid
investment grade rating. Overall, we believe that adequate
financing instruments are available to ensure sufficient liquidity
at all times.

Default risks

Default risks involve the risk of a loss if our debtors are fully
or partially unable to meet their payment commitments. The
credit risk of our customers and financial counterparties is
therefore systematically examined when the contracts are
concluded, and monitored continuously afterwards. Limits
are set for each contractual partner on the basis of internal or
rating-based creditworthiness analyses.

Financial opportunities and risks in connection with
pension obligations

Both opportunities and risks may arise from potential changes
in the parameters used to evaluate our pension obligations?.
Changes, especially in interest rates, but also in mortality
rates and rates of salary increases, can alter the present value
of pension obligations, which directly alters equity and can
result in changes in the expenses for pension plants.

overview of liquidity risks and their management can be found in note 9.2 to the consolidated financial statements. Details of the financing of the Evonik Group and action to
protect liquidity can be found in the section on financial condition. | 3 See note 6.9 to the consolidated financial statements.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2018 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

Market opportunities and risks, and liquidity and default risks
relating to financial instruments, also arise from the manage-
ment of our pension plan assets. We counter these risks
through an active risk management approach, combined with
detailed risk controlling. Strategic management of the port-
folios takes place via regular asset /liability studies. To minimize
risk, we use derivative hedging strategies where appropriate.
The broad diversification of asset classes, portfolio sizes, and
asset managers avoids cluster risks but there are unavoidable
residual risks in the individual investments.

Impairment risk

The risk of asset impairment arises when the interest rate used
in an impairment test rises, the forecast cash flows decline, or
investment projects are halted. Specific risks may arise in
connection with goodwill or individual assets.

3. Raw material markets

For our business operations we require both high-volume
commodities and smaller amounts of strategically relevant
raw materials that have to meet highly demanding specifica-
tions. In both cases Evonik is confronted with opportunities
and risks relating to the increasing volatility of the availability
of raw materials and their prices.

The operating business is dependent on the price of stra-
tegic raw materials, especially petrochemical feedstocks
obtained directly or indirectly from crude oil. The price of
renewable raw materials is also highly volatile and is driven,
for example, by weather-dependent harvest yields. Structural
changes in exchange rates are another significant aspect
affecting price risks. These risks are hedged by optimizing
the global focus of procurement activities, for example by
accessing new markets and concluding market-oriented
agreements. To further reduce the price risks with regard to
products that have intensive raw material requirements, our aim
is to pass both the risks and the opportunities of fluctuations
in raw material prices along to other stages in the value chain
where necessary, for example, through price escalation clauses.

The overriding aim of the procurement strategy is to
secure the availability of raw materials on the best possible
business terms. Short- and mid-term bottlenecks in the avail-
ability of precursors and intermediates are potential risks. As
well as making preparations to use substitute suppliers in an
emergency, we constantly observe the business performance of
suppliers of selected key raw materials to anticipate bottlenecks
and avoid risks.

Increasing volatility requires constant monitoring of the
corresponding risks in the value chain.

The opportunities and risks arising from changes in the price
of petrochemical feedstocks mainly affect the Performance
Materials segment because of its high procurement volume.
Risks relating to single sourcing and short-term restrictions
on the availability of raw materials mainly affect the Nutrition
& Care and Resource Efficiency segments.

Supply chain

Compliance with sustainability criteria in the supply chain is a
central aspect of procurement. We expect our suppliers to
share our principles of entrepreneurial responsibility. We
therefore have our own code of conduct for suppliers, based
on the principles of the UN Global Compact, the International
Labour Standards issued by the International Labour Organi-
zation (ILO), and the Responsible Care® initiative. Globally,
this approach to sustainability is also supported by the sector
initiative Together for Sustainability, of which Evonik is a
founding member, through the use of standardized assessments.
Evonik’'s principal suppliers and the majority of critical suppliers
have already taken part in these assessments, which are eval-
uated by an impartial sustainability rating company.

4. Production

As a specialty chemicals company, Evonik is exposed to the
tisk of business interruptions, quality problems, and unexpected
technical and IT malfunctions. Capacity constraints could hold
back organic growth. We use complex production processes,
some of them with interdependent production steps. Conse-
quently, disruption and stoppages can adversely affect subse-
quent production steps and products. The outage of production
facilities and interruptions in production workflows could
have a significant negative influence on business and earnings
performance, and could also harm people and the environment.
Group-wide policies on project and quality management,
highly qualified employees, and regular maintenance of our
plants effectively minimize these risks. Insofar as is economically
viable, we take out insurance to cover damage to our plants and
sites and production stoppages, so the financial consequences
of potential production risks are largely insured. Nevertheless,
there is a risk of unforeseeable individual incidents.

5. Research and development

Opportunities for Evonik also come from market-oriented
research and development (R&D), which we regard as an
important driver of profitable growth. We have a well-stocked
R&D pipeline with a balanced mixture of short-, mid-, and
long-term R&D projects. On the one hand, we constantly
strive to improve our processes in order to strengthen our
cost leadership, and on the other, our projects open the door

MANAGEMENT REPORT

Opportunity and risk report
Market and competition opportunities and risks

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

to new markets and new fields of technology. Our project
portfolio is consistently aligned to our growth engines and
innovation growth fields. Through our venture capital pro-
gram, we take stakes in companies whose know-how can
support us in joint developments. Aspects of digitalization are
becoming more significant.

Opportunities and risks in R&D relate to the viability of
planned product and process developments and the timing of
their implementation. We mainly see opportunities arising
from the introduction of new products that go beyond our
present planning in our six innovation growth fields.

6. Mergers & acquisitions

Active portfolio management has high priority for Evonik as
part of our value-based management approach. We have set
out clear procedures for preparing, analyzing, and undertaking
acquisitions and divestments. In particular, these include clear
rules on accountability and approval processes. An intensive
examination of potential acquisition targets (due diligence) is
undertaken before they are acquired. This involves systematic
identification of all major opportunities and risks and an
appropriate valuation. Key aspects of this process are strategic
focus, earnings power, and development potential, on the one
hand, and any legal, financial, and environmental risks, on the
other. New companies are rapidly integrated into the Evonik
Group and thus into our risk management and controlling
processes. Every transaction of this type entails a risk that
integration of the business may not be successful or that inte-
gration costs may be unexpectedly high, thus jeopardizing
realization of the planned quantitative and qualitative targets
such as synergies.

In the integration of the Air Products specialty additives
business and the Huber silica business, which were acquired
in 2017, Evonik is paying special attention to appropriate
measures to realize the identified opportunities and mitigate
the risks.

Where businesses no longer fit our strategy or meet our
profitability requirements despite optimization, we also examine
external options. If a planned divestment is not achieved
successfully, this could generate risks that impact the Evonik
Group's earnings position.

7. Other

A steady improvement in our cost position is necessary to
make us more competitive. Our goal is to achieve a lasting
reduction of €200 million in selling and administrative
expenses by 2021. Beside the potential to raise strategic
flexibility and strengthen the operating units as a result of
this program and other restructuring projects, there are risks

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

relating to their implementation. These include delays in
implementation, the loss of key personnel, ineffectiveness of
measures, and higher costs for the realization of measures.
Stringent project management, including involving relevant
stakeholders, is used to counter these risks.

8. Investments

Generating growth through investment entails risks as regards
the proposed scope and timing of projects. These risks are
addressed through established, structured processes. For
instance, we take a disciplined approach to implementing our
investment program. Both projects that have not yet started
and those that are already underway are constantly reviewed
for changes in the market situation and postponed if necessary.

At the same time, we regard building new production facili-
ties in regions with high growth momentum as an opportunity
to generate further profitable growth. For example, socio-
economic megatrends are driving the development of our
amino acids business. Following the successful start-up of a
world-scale facility for DL-methionine in Singapore in fall
2014, we are planning to bring another facility into service
here in 2019. Global population growth means that demand for
animal protein will continue to rise steadily in the future.
Moreover, environmentally compatible, resource-saving manu-
facture of products for animal and human nutrition is becoming
increasingly important worldwide for ecological reasons.

Resource efficiency is the basis for a large number of
energy-efficient and environment-friendly products from
Evonik. One example is precipitated silica, where we are a
market leader. Combining precipitated silica with silanes allows
the manufacture of tires with considerably lower rolling resis-
tance than conventional auto tires, resulting in fuel savings of
up to 8 percent. Here, future growth will be supported,
among other factors, by the introduction of tire labeling regu-
lations in further countries. To utilize the resultant opportuni-
ties, we are selectively increasing our capacity for silica. For
example, we brought a new production facility into service
in the USA at the end of 2018 and production capacity for
precipitated silica in Turkey is to be raised by 2020.

Our specialty polymer polyamide 12 (PA 12) is also a market
leader. In view of its outstanding properties—high stability
combined with flexibility, as well as high temperature resis-
tance and low weight—this high-performance polymer is
used as a substitute for steel in many demanding applications
in automotive and lightweight engineering and in oil and gas
pipelines. In addition, it is used in medical applications and 3D
printing. To meet the sharp rise in demand, we are planning a
new production complex for PA 12 in Marl (Germany), which
is scheduled to come on stream in 2021.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2018 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

The investments described above are included in our mid-
term planning.

9. Energy markets

Evonik requires considerable amounts of energy from a wide
variety of sources for its chemical facilities and infrastructure.
The main sources are natural gas, electricity, and coal. At
several sites, our power and steam requirements are fully or
partially met by resource-efficient co-generation plants. In
2018, we continued our constant monitoring of trends on the
national and international energy markets, enabling us to
respond in a risk- and cost-conscious manner.

In countries where the sourcing of energy is not state-
regulated, we procured and traded in energy and, where
necessary, emission allowances (CO; allowances) within the
framework of defined risk strategies. The aim is to balance the
risks and opportunities of volatile energy markets. Depending
on how the general conditions develop, our segments could be
faced with additional costs.

For Evonik facilities within the scope of the European
emissions trading system, adverse effects could arise from
the structure of the fourth trading period (2021 to 2030),
especially the possibility of a more stringent benchmark for
the allocation of free CO, allowances. In the broader regula-
tory context of the energy markets, the way in which the cost
of renewables is allocated among captive energy generators
in Germany is of particular significance for Evonik, especially
in view of the legal framework in Europe. That said, in principle
we assume that captive generation will continue to contribute
to the competitiveness of our German sites in the future.
Possible costs could arise from the increase in grid feed fees
resulting from the shift in German energy policy, including
further state-driven cost components and possible funda-
mental changes to the grid fee system. Overall, we are exposed
to fluctuations in the market price and cost of various energy
sources as a result of the specific demand/supply situation
and political events. These entail both opportunities and
risks.

1 See section on employees.

10. Human resources

As a global corporation, we respect the principles of the
International Charter of Human Rights, the ten principles of the
UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises, and the International Labour Standards of the
International Labour Organization (ILO). Compliance with all
employment laws is especially important to us.

Qualified specialists and managers are the basis for the
achievement of our strategic and operational targets and thus
a key competitive factor. Both the loss of key personnel and
difficulties in attracting and hiring skilled and talented staff
could therefore constitute a risk in this context.

To ensure that we can recruit and retain qualified staff to
meet our future requirements, we offer varied employment
opportunities worldwide, systematic personnel development,
and competitive remuneration. As a responsible employer,
Evonik helps the majority of employees build financial secu-
rity to cover adverse risk factors such as the risk of accident or
disability, and provide for retirement, either directly or
through pension contributions to external institutions. The
arrangements are based on the economic, legal, and tax situ-
ation in the various countries. In addition to this, we foster the
personal wellbeing of employees through programs such as
well@work, a range of consulting offers for employees caring
for close relatives, and support in childcare. In this way, we
retain and foster high performers and talented employees,
and position Evonik as an attractive employer for prospective
staff. We maintain close links to universities and professional
associations to help us recruit suitable youngsters. Both our
employer branding and many internal activities are aligned to
diversity. The aim is to make Evonik even more attractive to
talented specialists and managers."

Our strategic human resources planning identifies require-
ments for a five-year period so timely steps can be taken to
cover future personnel needs. We have thus largely limited
potential human resources risks. Opportunities and risks for
the development of personnel expenses could come, for
example, from future collective agreements.

MANAGEMENT REPORT

Opportunity and risk report
Legal/compliance opportunities and risks

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

6.4 Legal/compliance opportunities and risks

The opportunities and risks in this category are far more
difficult to quantify than market and competition risks, as
they not only have financial implications but often also
involve reputational risks for the company and/or criminal
law consequences. Provisions are set up on our balance sheet
to cover the financial impact. These are reflected in our
system as reducing risk. In view of this complexity, legal/
compliance opportunities and risks are not assigned to the
opportunity/risk matrix illustrated above, nor are they
allocated to the risk quantification classes.

1. Compliance, law, and the regulatory framework
Compliance means lawful business conduct. The principal
compliance rules are set out in the Evonik Code of Conduct,
which explicitly prohibits e.g., all forms of corruption, including
“facilitation payments,” and violation of antitrust regulations.
Risks could result from failure to comply with the corresponding
regulations. To minimize compliance risks, extensive training
and sensitization of employees is undertaken at face-to-face
training sessions and/or through e-learning programs. Our
code of conduct is binding for all Evonik employees world-
wide, including the executive board and the governance
bodies of all Evonik companies. They are required to comply
with the rules set forth in the code of conduct, to ensure they
are familiar with its content, and to take part in the relevant
training."

Evonik monitors the observance of human rights along its
value chain. To minimize the related risks, we require compli-
ance with our code of conduct for suppliers, our global social
policy, and the policy statement on human rights.

Evonik is exposed to legal risks, resulting, for example, from
legal disputes such as claims for compensation, and from
administrative proceedings and fines. In its operating business,
the Evonik Group is exposed to liability risks, especially in
connection with product liability, patent law, tax law, compe-
tition law, antitrust law, and environmental law. Changes in
public law could also give rise to legal risks or materially alter
such risk positions. As a chemical company with its own
power plants, risks of particular relevance here are a possible
change in the charges levied under the German Renewable
Energies Act (EEG) and amendments to the European emissions
trading regulations.

1 See declaration on corporate governance.

Further, Evonik may be liable for guarantee claims relating to
divestments. Structured post-transaction management closely
monitors any liability and guarantee risks resulting from
divestments. We have developed a concept involving high
quality and safety standards to ensure a controlled approach
to such legal risks.

Insurance cover has been purchased for the financial
consequences of any damage that may nevertheless occur as
a result of damage to property, product liability claims, and
other risks. Where necessary, Evonik sets up provisions for
legal risks.

At present, the relevant legal risks are the issues outlined
below. As a matter of principle, we refrain from evaluating
the opportunities and risks of potential legal proceedings or
proceedings that have commenced, in order not to influence
our position.

Evonik is currently involved in two ongoing appraisal pro-
ceedings in connection with the squeeze-out of non-controlling
interests pursuant to section 327a et seq of the German Stock
Corporation Act (AktG): the squeeze-out of non-controlling
interests in RUTGERS AG (now RUTGERS GmbH) in 2003, and
the squeeze-out of non-controlling interests in Degussa AG
(now Evonik Degussa GmbH) in 2006. The appraisal proceed-
ings comprise a court review of the appropriateness of cash
settlements.

In connection with the divestment of the former carbon
black activities, the purchaser has requested indemnification
from environmental guarantees, for example, relating to alleged
infringement of the US Clean Air Act. Evonik is currently
engaged in a dispute with the purchaser on this.

Following a fine imposed by the EU Commission in 2002 on
various methionine producers (including Evonik), the Brazilian
antitrust authorities have filed proceedings against Evonik in
connection with the delivery of methionine to Brazil. Evonik is
of the opinion that a fine cannot be imposed due to the statute
of limitations.

Furthermore, following completion of administrative
proceedings outside Germany, it is not improbable that indi-
vidual customers could file claims for compensation.

With regard to employment law, there are risks relating, for
example, to recalculation of pension commitments entered into
by Evonik and its legal predecessors.

Tax risks relate to differences in the valuation of business
processes, capital expenditures, and restructuring by the
financial authorities, tax reforms in some countries, and
potential retroactive payments in the wake of tax audits.

2. Information security and the protection of

intellectual property and know-how
Innovations play a significant part in Evonik’s business
success. Protecting know-how and intellectual property is
therefore of central importance. With markets growing ever
closer and the globalization of business, a competent
approach to protecting our competitive edge is a key element
in our investment activities. The company is also exposed to a
risk that intellectual property cannot be adequately protected,
even through patents, especially when building new production
facilities in certain countries. Similarly, the transfer of know-
how in joint ventures and other forms of cooperation also
entails a risk of an outflow of expertise from Evonik. For
example, in the event of the possible separation from a joint
venture or other cooperation partner there is no guarantee
that the business partner will not continue to use know-how
transferred or disclose it to third parties, thereby damaging
Evonik’s competitive position.

Measures to minimize and avoid such risks are coordinated
by the Corporate Security, Law, and Intellectual Property
Management units.

IT risks

Electronic information processing is a key element in Evonik’s
success. Therefore, sustained protection of information and
the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of |T-assisted
business processes are especially important. If these systems
and information are compromised, there is a significant risk
that this could have a detrimental effect on our business and
production processes. To protect them and the associated
knowledge from cyber criminality (including industrial espio-
nage and manipulation through electronic attacks) from both
within and outside the Evonik Group and to minimize such
risks, we have developed an IT security strategy and established
organizational and technical measures. The secure use of
information systems is described in binding group-wide policies
and regulations and driven forward and monitored by an
internal control system.

In view of the considerable and continuously rising threat,
we regularly review our security measures, implement risk-
based countermeasures as required, and adapt them wherever
necessary. Training, including compulsory training in some
cases, and constant information, for example, via the Evonik
Group intranet and internal social networking platforms,
keep employees aware of the need for IT security. Strictly
confidential information that Evonik needs to protect is
identified and corresponding protective measures are imple-
mented. At the same time, managers’ awareness of this issue

1 Especially water shortages.

is raised. The Evonik Computer Emergency Response Team
(CERT) is networked externally at various levels (Germany:
member of the German CERT network, Europe: member of
TF-CSIRT*, globally: member of FIRST).

3. Environmental risks (environment, safety,
health, quality)

Evonik is exposed to risks in the areas of occupational and
plant safety. For example, workplace accidents and incidents
in production facilities can cause injury to our employees or
substance releases that impair the health of our employees
and local residents. We counter these risks by living our
understanding of safety as a holistic management task at all
management levels. Our guiding principles for safety are bind-
ing for all managers and employees. In this way, Evonik
makes it clear that safety is a central element in its corporate
culture. We analyze accidents and incidents carefully so we
can learn from them. Moreover, audits are conducted at the
request of the executive board to check the controlled han-
dling of such risks.

The aim of our product stewardship is timely identification
and evaluation of possible health and environmental risks in
our portfolio. We examine the entire value chain of each of
our products—from procurement of the raw materials to
delivery to our industrial customers, who receive all relevant
information on the handling and disposal of our products.
That includes, for example, safety data sheets and technical
information sheets. As well as complying with all statutory
requirements such as the European chemicals regulation
(REACH) and the Globally Harmonized System of Classification
and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS), product stewardship at
Evonik includes voluntary commitments that go beyond these
regulations.

The effects of climate change are already visible today, for
example, in water stress’ and acute weather-related events
such as low water levels in the river Rhine and hurricanes.
Alongside these direct negative effects of climate change, we
are also exposed to risks resulting from stricter environmental
regulations.

Furthermore, the group-wide environmental protection
and quality management system, which is validated as con-
forming to international standards, undergoes constant devel-
opment and improvement. As a responsible chemical com-
pany, Evonik ensures that such processes are operated in
accordance with the principles of the global Responsible
Care® initiative and the UN Global Compact.

6.5 Process/organization risks

1. General

This risk category covers the interface between risk manage-
ment and the internal control system (ICS). In this category,
risks generally result from specific process shortcomings.
Alongside general weaknesses, these include, in particular,
risks within the ICS and the accounting-related ICS. Classifi-
cation is therefore based on the list of processes drawn up by
Corporate Audit. Starting from key corporate processes, the
existence of relevant control objectives and standard controls
for the main risks identified is checked. In view of the types
of risk in this category, a purely qualitative assessment is
normally used.

The evaluation of specific risks resulting from weaknesses in
processes within the organizational units showed very little
scope to optimize existing processes because of the efficacy of
the current controls. Corresponding improvement measures
have been identified. There are therefore no signs of systematic
errors in the Evonik Group’s ICS.

2. Internal control system for financial accounting

The main financial reporting risks are identified in the ICS
through a quantitative and a qualitative analysis. Controls are
defined for each risk area of the accounting process. Their
efficacy is reviewed at regular intervals and improved where
necessary. All elements of the control process are verified by
the internal audit function on the basis of random samples.

To ensure the quality of financial statements we have a
group-wide policy which defines uniform accounting and
valuation principles for all German and foreign companies
included in the consolidated financial statements for the Evonik
Group. The majority of companies have delegated the prepa-
ration of their financial statements to Global Financial Services.

structured internal processes, for example as a result of changes
in the regulatory framework, further unplanned additions to
such provisions may be necessary.

Through systematic process orientation, standardization, and
the utilization of economies of scale, this leverages sustained
cost benefits and also improves the quality of accounting.
Global Financial Services has developed a standardized
control matrix for the internal control system for financial
accounting. This is implemented in the three global shared
service centers: in Offenbach (Germany) for Germany, Austria,
and Finland, in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) for the Asia region
and EMEA! countries not served by the Offenbach center,
and in San Jose (Costa Rica) for the Americas region. The aim
is to ensure a uniform global standard for the internal control
system for financial accounting. In principle, the annual finan-
cial statements of all fully consolidated companies and all
joint operations are audited. In the few exceptions from this
rule, an upfront risk assessment is performed with the auditor.

All data are consolidated by the Accounting division using
the SAP SEM-BCS system. Group companies submit their
financial statements via a web-based interface. A range of
technical validations is performed at this stage. Computerized
and manual process controls and checking by a second person
are the key oversight functions performed in the financial
reporting process. The preparation of the monthly consolidated
income statement and publication of three quarterly reports
allow us to gain experience with new accounting issues and
provide a sound basis for plausibilization of the year-end
accounts. The executive board receives monthly reports, and
quarterly reports are submitted to the audit committee of the
supervisory board.

Aspects that may represent opportunities or risks for
financial reporting in the future are identified and evaluated
early through the risk management system. This ensures that
risk management can be closely aligned to controlling and
accounting processes.

Economic background

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

7.1 Economic background

Global economy expected to grow more slowly

in 2019

We expect global economic conditions in 2019 to be slightly
weaker than in 2018. The US government's protectionist
measures will presumably impair global trade further in 2019
and also affect industrial output and thus the global economy
via global value chains. Moreover, the deterioration in financing
conditions resulting from the expected continuation of the
US Federal Reserve's policy of monetary tightening will
again hold back growth, especially in the highly indebted
emerging markets. Overall, we anticipate weaker global
momentum, with a growth rate of 2.9 percent in 2019, com-
pared with 3.2 percent in 2018.

mm 2019 (forecast) 2018 (expected)

We assume that the pace of growth in Europe will gradually
slow, principally because of the weakness of manufacturing
industry in Germany, France, and Italy. In addition, the head-
wind from foreign trade will probably increase. This will be
countered, however, by ongoing monetary policy stimulation
and robust consumer spending. There is likely to be further
uncertainty with regard to the future economic relations
between the European Union and the UK in 2019, which will
hold back the economy, especially in the UK.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

We assume further robust growth in the USA. However, the
pace will be slightly more modest, because the effects of
fiscal measures such as tax relief and higher state spending
will be lower than in the previous year. Growth will also be
supported by buoyant consumer demand and solid invest-
ment spending. Monetary policy will be less expansionary.

Thanks to the economic upturn in Brazil, growth should
pick up further in Central & South America. However, political
uncertainty in some countries, high unemployment, and private
debt are holding back a significant improvement in the eco-
nomic prospects for this region.

Growth will remain high in the Asia-Pacific region. The
Japanese economy will be supported by expansionary monetary
and fiscal policy but will probably weaken slightly compared
with the previous year. We assume that growth will slow
further in China. However, since the government is prepared
to introduce economic measures to alleviate the impact of
punitive US customs tariffs, we do not anticipate a drastic
slowdown in growth momentum in 2019.

The projection for the global economy is affected by
increasing uncertainty. For example, we see a risk that an
escalation of the trade disputes could perceptibly dampen
global economic activity. If the economic slowdown in China
gains momentum, this could greatly reduce global growth.
Moreover, an increase in the already elevated political risks in
the European Union, including the uncertainty about the
future economic relations between the European Union and
the UK, could dampen economic momentum. Finally, there
are initial signs that both the normalization of the US mone-
tary policy and the risks associated with the ongoing trade
disputes could unsettle the capital markets, leading to correc-
tion phases on the financial markets or an intensified reversal
of capital flows. This would adversely affect the emerging
markets, in particular, and hold back the global economy.

Given the anticipated slower global economic momentum
and relatively stable raw material price trend, we only expect
to see a moderate rise in global inflation.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2018 EVONIK INDUSTRIES

In view of the sharp drop in the price of crude oil at the end
of 2018, we assume that Evonik’s petroleum-based feedstock
prices will decline in the first quarter of 2019. Prices should
then stabilize, despite the present heightened uncertainty on
global markets. Overall, we expect that in 2019 prices of
Evonik-specific raw materials will be slightly lower than in
2018.

7.2 Outlook

Basis for our forecast:
Global growth of 2.9 percent
Euro/US dollar exchange rate: US$1.15 (2018: USS1.18)
Internal raw material cost index slightly lower than in the
prior year

Sales and earnings
The following outlook still includes the methacrylates
business. It also takes into account the effects of first-time
application of IFRS 16 Leases in 2019. The earnings from the
planned acquisition of the US company PeroxyChem are not
yet included.

The anticipated reduction in global growth momentum
outlined in the economic background section will affect our
business performance in 2019.

We therefore expect sales to be slightly’ lower to stable in
2019 (2018: €15.0 billion).

We also expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly lower! to
stable (2018: €2.061 billion). This includes the negative
normalization effects of the previously very favorable
supply/demand situation in the methacrylates business.

Adjusted EBITDA should be supported by further synergies
from the integration of the businesses acquired in 2017 from
Air Products and Huber, as well as cost-savings from our
efficiency program for sales and administration (SG&A
2020).

We assume a continuation of the volume growth and positive
earnings trend in the majority of businesses in the Nutrition
& Care segment. With new production capacities coming on
stream, we expect the annual average prices for essential
amino acids for animal nutrition to be lower than in the
previous year. To offset the impact on our earnings, in 2018

We assume that in 2019 the average euro exchange rate will
be around the 2018 level as a result of the growth differential
and interest rate spread between the euro zone and the USA.

we embarked on a program to raise the efficiency of our ani-
mal nutrition business. In addition, earnings will be adversely
affected by expenses for the planned start-up of our new
methionine facility in Singapore. Overall, earnings in the
Nutrition & Care Segment are expected to be slightly lower
than in the previous year.

In 2019, the Resource Efficiency segment will continue to
benefit from its good positioning in the respective markets
and from the trend to resource-efficient solutions. Although
growth is expected to slow in some end-markets and regions,
we expect earnings to be slightly higher than in the previous
year.

In the Performance Materials segment, the recent very
favorable demand/supply situation in the methacrylates busi-
ness is expected to normalize. As a result, this segment will
not be able to repeat the very high level of earnings seen in
2018; earnings will be perceptibly lower than in 2018.

The earnings impact of the anticipated slight reduction in raw
material prices may affect the various businesses differently,
but should balance out across the portfolio as a whole.

In 2019, the return on capital employed (ROCE) should
remain above the cost of capital (10.0 percent before taxes).
Partly due to the increase in capital employed resulting from
the initial application of IFRS 16 in 2019, ROCE will be
slightly lower than in the previous year (2018: 12.1 percent).

Financing and investments

We expect capital expenditures to be around the prior-year
level at about €1 billion in 2019 (2018: €1.05 billion). The
budget for maintenance and growth investments is around
€850 million. As a temporary effect in 2019, there will be
additional capital expenditure for the construction of a fully
backwardly integrated polyamide 12 plant in Marl (Germany).

1 Inthe context of sales, slightly refers to a change of between 1 and 5 percent. In the context of adjusted EBITDA, slightly refers to a change of between 1 and 10 percent.

Report on expected developments
Outlook

We expect the free cash flow to improve significantly year-
on-year in 2019 (2018: €672 million). Positive effects will
come from the first reimbursement of pensions payments by
the CTA!, which will bring a substantial and lasting improve-
ment in the free cash flow, and from lower cash outflows
from net working capital than in 2018. Negative factors will
be a normalization of tax payments, cash outflows for the
SG&A 2020 efficiency enhancement program, and higher
bonus payments as a result of the successful business perfor-
mance in 2018.

Occupational and plant safety

We assume that the accident frequency rate will remain
below the upper limit of 1.30 defined for 2019. We anticipate
that we can achieve a slight improvement in our plant safety
indicator, incident frequency (2018: 1.08), and that it will
remain below the upper limit of 1.10.
