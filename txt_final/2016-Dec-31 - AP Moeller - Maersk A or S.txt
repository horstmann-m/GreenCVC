A.P. Moller - Maersk — Annual Report 2016

HIGHLIGHTS

A.P. Moller - Maersk delivered an unsatis-
factory loss of USD 1.9bn (profit of USD
925m) negatively impacted by post-tax
impairments of USD 2.8bn (USD 2.6bn)
primarily relating to Maersk Drilling of
USD 1.46n (USD 27m) and Maersk Supply
Service of USD 1.2bn (USD Om). In line
with the latest guidance provided in
November, the underlying profit came
at USD 711m (USD 3.1bn). The return

on invested capital (ROIC) was negative
2.7% (positive 2.9%). The free cash flow
was negative USD 29m (positive USD
6.6bn including the sale of shares in
Danske Bank of USD 4.9bn).

The demand for transportation of goods grew below expecta-
tions in the first half of the year, leading to a significant down-
ward pressure on freight rates. In the second half of the year
and especially in 04, demand increased while deliveries of new
capacity were reduced, which led to a gradual improvement
of freight rates. The difficult business environment during the
year enabled industry consolidation and a major container
carrier went out of business, while Maersk Line continued its
cost leadership strategy and gained significant market shares.
The consolidation in the container shipping industry as well as
the challenging oil price environment had a negative impact on
earnings in APM Terminals, who over the past years has been
significantly expanding its terminal network, particularly in
emerging and oil dependent economies.

Oil prices reached their lowest level at the beginning of the year
and have since then increased significantly, albeit from a very
low level. Maersk Oil adjusted to market conditions by success-
fully accelerating cost reduction programmes beyond original
targets, while at the same time improving production efficiency
and progressing on major projects.

Despite significant cost optimisation initiatives, Maersk Drilling
and Maersk Supply Service were severely impacted by con-
tinued large scale cost reductions and project cancellations in
the oil industry and the large inflow of new capacity over the
last years. Based on the challenging market conditions, signif-
icant impairments were recognised in Maersk Drilling (USD
1.5bn pre-tax or 18% of invested capital and a newbuilding con-
tract) and Maersk Supply Service (USD 1.2bn pre-tax or 44% of
invested capital and newbuilding contracts). Maersk Tankers
improved their commercial performance, contract coverage
and cost savings, partly offsetting the negative impact from de-
clining rates. In line with the new strategy, all oil and oil related
businesses initiated processes to prepare for separation from
AP. Moller - Maersk.

AP. Moller - Maersk recorded a loss of USD 1.9bn (profit of USD
925m) and a ROIC of negative 2.7% (positive 2.9%) in 2016,
negatively impacted by post-tax impairments of USD 2.8bn
(USD 2.6bn) and a significantly lower underlying result of USD
711m (USD 3.1bn) severely impacted by price pressure and low
market growth in all industries.

The underlying profit of USD 711m was within the guidance of be-
low USD 1.0bn. Compared to last year, the reduction in the under-
lying result was due to losses in Maersk Line and Maersk Supply
Service and with lower underlying results in APM Terminals,
Maersk Tankers and Svitzer, while Maersk Oil, Maersk Drilling
and Damco recorded increased underlying profits.

Revenue decreased to USD 35.5bn (USD 40.3bn) across all eight
businesses, predominantly due to lower average container
freight rates and lower oil price. Operating expenses decreased
by USD 2.6bn mainly due to lower bunker prices and focus on
cost efficiency across all businesses.

AP. Moller - Maersk’s cash flow from operating activities was
USD 4.3bn (USD 8.0bn) impacted by the lower profit, higher net
working capital and a one-off dispute settlement in Maersk Oil.
Net cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 4.4bn (USD
6.3bn excluding the sale of shares in Danske Bank of USD 4.9bn).
Gross cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 5.0bn,
USD 1.0bn lower than latest guidance, mainly due to timing of
payments in APM Terminals and Maersk Drilling.

Net interest-bearing debt increased to USD 10.7bn (USD 7.8bn)
mainly due to share buy-back of USD 475m, dividends of USD
1.0bn, new finance leases of USD 947m and net interest-bearing
debt of USD 0.4bn acquired through the Grup Maritim TCB
transaction partly offset by proceeds from sale of Danske Bank
shares of USD 482m.

A.P. Moller - Maersk — Annual Report 2016

With an equity ratio of 52.5% (57.3%) and a liquidity reserve
of USD 11.8bn (USD 12.4bn), A-P. Moller - Maersk maintains its
strong financial position.

Maersk Line recorded a loss of USD 376m (profit of USD 1.3bn)
and a ROIC of negative 1.9% (positive 6.5%). The underlying
result was a loss of USD 384m (profit of USD 1.3bn) due to poor
market conditions leading to sustained lower freight rates
partly offset by higher volumes and lower unit costs related
to lower bunker price, higher utilisation and cost efficiencies.

Maersk Line reached an agreement on 1 December 2016 to
acquire Hamburg Stid, the German container shipping line.
Hamburg Siid is the world’s seventh largest container ship-
ping line and a leader in the North-South trades. The acqui-

APM Terminals reported a profit of USD 438m (USD 654m)
and a ROIC of 5.7% (10.9%). The underlying profit was USD
433m (USD 626m). Lower profit in commercially challenged
terminals in Latin America, North-West Europe and Africa as
a consequence of liner network changes and weak underlying
markets was only partly offset by cost saving initiatives.

Damco reported a profit of USD 31m (USD 19m) and a ROIC of
14.6% (7.1%), while Svitzer recorded a profit of USD 91m (USD
120m) and a ROIC of 7.5% (10.9%).

Maersk Oil recorded a profit of USD 477m (loss of USD 2.1bn)
with a positive ROIC of 11.4% (negative 38.6%) against an aver-
age oil price of USD 44 per barrel in 2016 versus USD 52 per bar-
rel in 2015. The underlying profit was USD 497m (USD 435m),
positively impacted by operating cost reductions of 36%, ahead
of the targeted 20% for the period 2014-2016, lower exploration
costs, higher production efficiency and reduction of abandon-
ment provision of USD 93m. This was partly offset by the effect
of the lower average oil price.

Maersk Drilling reported a loss of USD 694m (profit of USD
751m) negatively impacted by post-tax impairments of USD
1.4bn (USD 27m) giving a ROIC of negative 9.0% (positive 9.3%).
The underlying profit of USD 743m (USD 732m) was positively
impacted by termination fees of approximately USD 150m moved
from 2017 to 2016, high operational uptime and savings on oper-
ating costs offset by ten rigs being idle or partly idle versus three
rigs last year. The financial effect from the increased number
of rigs without contract reduced the result in 04 significantly.

Maersk Supply Service reported a loss of USD 1.2bn (profit
of USD 147m) and a ROIC of negative 76.7% (positive 8.5%) im-
pacted by impairments of USD 1.2bn (USD Om), lower rates and
utilisation as well as fewer vessel days available for trading
due to divestments and lay-ups. The underlying loss was USD
44m (profit of USD 117m).

Maersk Tankers recorded a profit of USD 62m (USD 160m)
and a ROIC of 3.7% (9.9%), negatively impacted by declining
rates, partly offset by improved commercial performance, con-
tract coverage and cost savings.

Other businesses reported a loss of USD 117m (profit of USD
316m) mainly driven by an impairment of USD 131m in the
RORO business. The result for 2015 included gains from sale
of shares in Danske Bank of USD 223m and sale of Esvagt of
USD 76m.

lying profit above 2016 (USD 711m). Gross
capital expenditure for 2017 is expected
to be USD 5.5-6.56n (USD 5.0bn).

Forward-looking statements

The Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Such
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as various
factors, many of which are beyond A.P. Moller - Maersk's
control, may cause actual development and results to differ
materially from expectations contained in the Annual Report.

The financial reporting for 2017 will change effective as of Q12017
as a consequence of the new structure for A.P. Moller - Maersk

with a Transport & Logistics division and an Energy division.

All figures in parenthesis refer to full year 2016.

The Transport & Logistics division expects an underlying profit
above USD Ibn.

Due to gradual improvements in container rates Maersk Line
expects an improvement in excess of USD 1bn in underlying
profit compared to 2016 (loss of USD 384m).

Global demand for seaborne container transportation is ex-
pected to increase 2-4%.

0.5bn, with Maersk Oil being the main contributor.

The entitlement production is expected at a level of 215,000-
225,000 boepd (313,000 boepd) for the full-year and around
150,000-160,000 boepd for the second half of the year after exit
from Qatar mid-July. Exploration costs in Maersk Oil are ex-
pected to be around the 2016 level (USD 223m).

Net financial expenses for A.P. Moller - Maersk are expected
around USD 0.5bn.

The guidance for 2017 excludes the acquisition of Hamburg Stid.

A.P. Moller - Maersk — Annual Report 2016

STRATEGY

A.P. Moller - Maersk will become an
integrated transport and logistics business,
while the oil and oil related businesses,
either individually or in combination, are to
be separated from A.P. Moller - Maersk.

Following a strategic review initiated in June 2016, the Board
of Directors decided to reorganise A.P. Moller - Maersk into two
independent divisions; an integrated Transport & Logistics
division and an Energy division with effect from end-September
2016.

Going forward, the main growth focus of A-P. Moller - Maersk
will be on delivering best in class transportation and logistics
services as an integrated business. Building on the unique posi-
tion within container transport and port operations as well as
on the significant position in supply chain management and
freight forwarding, Transport & Logistics division will leverage
its leading position to become the global integrator of container
logistics, connecting and simplifying the global supply chain.

The Board of Directors has concluded that the oil and oil related
businesses each will require different solutions for sustainable
future operations, including separation of entities individually
or in combination, from A-P. Moller - Maersk. Depending on mar-
ket developments and structural opportunities, the objective is
to find structural solutions for the oil and oil related businesses
before the end of 2018.

Financial reporting for the new divisions will be effectuated
from the financial year 2017.

= Contents

TRANSPORT & LOGISTICS DIVISION

Above 8.5% ROIC over the cycle while growing revenue

Transport & Logistics consists of Maersk Line, APM Terminals,

Damco, Svitzer and Maersk Container Industry based on a one-

company structure with multiple brands. The vision for Trans-

port & Logistics is to become the global integrator of container

logistics by connecting and simplifying the global supply chain.

There are three cornerstones to realise the vision:

¢ Providing simple solutions to customers’ complex supply
chain needs

¢ Elevating the customer experience through digital
innovation

¢ Offering the industry's most competitive container
transport network to every market in the world.

Managing and operating the business activities in Transport

& Logistics in a more integrated manner can unlock profitable
growth and synergies through stronger collaboration and dis-
ciplined capital allocation.

The profitable growth will be realised from better customer
experience across the brands in Transport & Logistics. By
covering the entire value chain, supported by digitisation,
Transport & Logistics can offer customers reliable logistics
services and integrated offerings via tailor-made solutions
and expanded products.

Significant synergies will stem from increasing terminal utilisa-
tion by ensuring that Maersk Line uses APM Terminals where
feasible, at market prices. Productivity will be enhanced by
better collaboration and planning between Maersk Line, APM
Terminals and Svitzer, especially in APM Terminals key hubs.
Organising the five businesses into one Transport & Logistics
division also enables significant overhead reductions as over-
lapping functions are eliminated. Finally, increased cross-sell-
ing between Maersk Line, APM Terminals, Damco and Svitzer
unlocks potential synergies.

das >


--- Page 7 ---

A.P. Moller - Maersk — Annual Report 2016

The synergies from integration are expected over a three year
period to generate up to two percentage points in ROIC im-
provement. The Transport & Logistics division targets a ROIC
above 8.5% over the cycle combined with growing revenue.

ENERGY DIVISION

Optimising value

Energy consists of Maersk Oil, Maersk Drilling, Maersk Supply
Service and Maersk Tankers.

The businesses within Energy continue to be operated and
managed individually with the aim of finding sustainable
structural solutions before the end of 2018.

The strategy of Maersk Oil is to build on its strong position
in the North Sea by maximising value from safe operations
and ensuring world-class delivery of projects like Culzean, UK,
and Johan Sverdrup, Norway. Exploration activities will be
kept at a low level, while focus will be on continuous cost
reductions and improved production efficiencies. Portfolio
management will focus on the North Sea and be based on
optimal capability fit.

Maersk Drilling is focused on recalibrating its business through
continued cost reductions and best-in-class drilling services
to its customers while pursuing superior operational perfor-
mance. Maersk Drilling will through a deeper engagement with
its customers seek to find new models of collaboration that will
help customers drive down the overall production cost of oil
and gas.

Maersk Supply Service will continue to reduce its cost level
and is actively contributing to restoring the supply and de-
mand balance by reducing its fleet by 21 vessels over a period
of 21 months. Maersk Supply Service has the ambition of be-
coming a leading integrator of marine services and solutions
for the offshore energy sector, with the aim to bundle services

and manage subcontractors to offer simple and efficient opera-
tions to customers.

Maersk Tankers will continue to pursue its Taking Lead strat-
egy to retain a strong market position. The strategy is based
on digitisation across the priorities; active position taking, cost
leadership and third party services.

STRATEGY PROCESS

The Board of Directors will continue to perform an annual
strategy review for the Transport & Logistics division and for
each of the businesses in the Energy division, including a capi-
tal allocation process. The annual strategy conference is held in
June at which the Board of Directors discusses proposals put
forward by the Management Board and decides any adjust-
ments to the overall strategy.

Strategies, including detailed financial forecasts, plans and
opportunities for the coming years, are developed for the
Transport & Logistics division and each of the businesses in the
Energy division. The total capital requirement across both divi-
sions will be subject to the overall focus on disciplined capital
behaviour and will be prioritised in line with the financial
policies of A.P. Moller - Maersk and the commitment to main-
tain an investment grade credit rating.

Between each strategy session, the Management Board and
the Board of Directors evaluate the development compared

to expectations, and these evaluations may give rise to adjust-
ments of the investment plans and key focus areas.

FINANCIAL
REVIEW OF THE
BUSINESSES

For detailed financial information, cf. note 1
in the Consolidated financial statements.

TRANSPORT & LOGISTICS DIVISION

MAERSK LINE
Maersk Line made a loss of USD 376m (profit of USD1.3bn) and
a ROIC of negative 1.9% (positive 6.5%).

Revenue of 20.7bn was 13% lower than in 2015 (USD 23.7bn).
The development in revenue was driven by an 18.7% decline in
average freight rates to 1,795 USD/FFE (2,209 USD/FFE) and
only partially offset by a 9.4% increase in volumes to 10,415k
FFE (9,522k FFE). Volumes increased across all trades, with
the biggest contributors being East-West backhaul increasing
198k FFE (19%) and North-South headhaul increasing 221k
FFE (7.3%).

The lower freight rates were attributable to oversupply in the

market as well as modest market demand especially in Africa
and Latin America. Maersk Line's freight rates declined sig-
nificantly across all trades. On East-West, the North American

trade declined the most due to increased competition as well
as increase in backhaul cargo at lower freight rates. On North-
South, the West Central Asia trade declined the most, impacted
by imbalance from oversupply built up over 2015 and 2016.
Meanwhile, container demand on the North-South trades was
notably suppressed in 2016, mainly due to declining imports
in Africa and South America. Recognised freight revenue was
USD 18.6bn (USD 21.3bn) and other revenue was USD 2.1bn
(USD 2.4bn).

Cost leadership remains a key strategic priority and Maersk
Line delivered a record low unit cost at both floating and fixed
bunker price. The unit cost at floating bunker was 1,982 USD/
FFE or 13% below 2015 (2,288 USD/FFE) while the unit cost
at fixed bunker was 10% below 2015. The unit cost benefited
from improved fleet utilisation and cost efficiencies while unit
cost at floating bunker benefited from a 29% decrease in bun-
ker price. The total bunker cost in 2016 was USD 2.1bn (USD
2.8bn). Bunker efficiency improved by 2.2% to 910 kg/FFE (931
kg/FFE). The cost initiatives announced in 04 2015 progressed
in line with expectations.

The EBIT margin gap to peers (adjusted for impairments, etc.)
is estimated at around 6%-points (7%-points) for the full year
(Q4 2015 to O3 2016), above the 5%-points ambition level.

Maersk Line’s fleet consisted of 292 owned vessels (1,929k
TEU) and 347 chartered vessels (1,310k TEU) with a total ca-
pacity of 3,239k TEU by the end of 2016, an increase of 9.4%
compared to the end of 2015. Idle capacity at the end of 2016
was 25k TEU (3 vessels) compared to 33k TEU (4 vessels) at
the end of 2015.

Maersk Line's total order book corresponds to 11% of the current
fleet, compared to industry order book of around 16%. In total
Maersk Line has 27 vessels in the order book (367k TEU) for
delivery in 2017 and 2018. This consists of eleven 19.6k TEU

second generation Triple-E, nine 14k TEU vessels and seven
3.6k TEU ice-class vessels for the intra-European market.

Maersk Line has decided to recycle eight Panamax class ves-
sels during 01 2017 as the vessels are at their economical end
of life. The vessels represent approximately 1% of the Maersk

Recycling Standard".

Compared to 2015, cash flow from operating activities decreased
by USD 2.2bn to USD 1.1bn. Cash flow used for capital expenditure
was USD 1.6bn lower at USD 586m as there were no deliveries
of newbuild vessels. Maersk Line delivered a positive free cash
flow of USD 474m (USD 1.1bn).

Developments in 2016

Maersk Line reached an agreement on 1 December 2016 to
acquire Hamburg Stid. Hamburg Siid is the world’s seventh
largest container shipping line and a leader in the North-South
trades. The acquisition is subject to final agreement expected
early O2 2017 and to regulatory approvals expected end 2017.
The transaction is expected to be completed end 2017. Hamburg
Std will continue to operate as a separate brand and will keep
its local organisations and headquarters in Hamburg, Germany.
Customers will benefit from having access to a wider and more
effective network.

The EU Commission initiated a formal investigation into 14 con-
tainer shipping companies including Maersk Line in 2013. The
EU Commission announced in July 2016 that it closed its formal
investigation without finding an infringement of EU competition
law.

The market

The challenging market conditions in the container industry
continued in 2016. As a testimony to the situation, for the first
time in 30 years, the industry saw a major carrier, Hanjin, go
out of business. The industry has responded to the challenging
market conditions by consolidating. CMA CGM completed its
acquisition of Neptune Orient Lines (NOL) and the two Chinese
carriers COSCO and CSCL completed their merger in 2016. Ad-
ditionally three mergers and acquisitions have been agreed,

= Contents

but are still pending regulatory approval; the merger between
Hapagq Lloyd and UASC, the merger between the three Japanese
carriers NYK, MOL & K Line and Maersk Line's acquisition of
Hamburg Stid. Maersk Line's acquisition of Hamburg Stid is still
pending final agreement.

2M partners and the South Korean container shipping line
Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM) announced a new strategic
cooperation on the East-West trades in December 2016. The
cooperation is outside the scope of 2M but will provide HMM
access to the 2M network through a combination of slot ex-
changes and slot purchases. Maersk Line and MSC will charter
and operate a number of vessels from HMM. The agreement
is scheduled to begin in April 2017 and is subject to regulatory
approval. The initial contract is three years with an option
to extend.

The industry dynamics continued to impact the container in-
dustry in 2016. The inflow of new container vessels was high
in the last part of 2015 and early part of 2016. This added to the
existing excess supply as global container demand continued
to remain subdued in 2016. These supply/demand develop-
ments led to significant downwards pressure on freight rates
and industry revenues, especially in the first half of the year.

Global container demand grew 2-3% in 2016. Demand growth
was low in the first half of 2016 but improved in the second half
of 2016, especially in 04. This partly reflects the contrast to the
very weak demand in late 2015, but also reflects improvements
in the global economic environment. Container demand on
the East-West trades was decent in 2016, driven by higher US
imports supported by the US economic expansion and the
strong USD. European imports developed more softly and in
line with GDP growth in the region. The declining imports in
Africa and South America negatively impacted the container
demand on the North-South trades. However, imports to South
America stabilised somewhat in 04, reflecting early signs of

das b

the Brazilian economy stabilising and improvements in com-
modity prices.

Global container fleet capacity grew 4% in 2016 (Alphaliner), but
with lower growth towards the end of the year. At the end of
2016, the fleet stood at 20.3m TEU of which 6.9% (7.0%) was idle.
934k TEU (136 vessels) were delivered and 665k TEU (201 ves-
sels) were scrapped during 2016. Deliveries were dominated
by the 10,000+ vessel segments while mainly smaller and mid-
sized vessels were scrapped. The average scrapping age con-
tinued to decline and was 19 years in 2016, which compares to
an average of 30 years in 2008 where the scrapping age was at
its highest. New orderings amounted to 292k TEU (82 vessels),
leading to a drop in the order book to 16% (20%) of the fleet at
the end of 2016.

The supply/demand gap widened further in the first half of
2016. This resulted in freight rates continuing the downward
trend seen in 2015 and in the first part of 2016, before stabilis-
ing and even improving gradually in the second half of 2016.
Developments in oil and fuel prices supported these dynamics.
On average, the China Composite Freight Index (CCFI) declined
by 19% in 2016, similar to the development on Maersk Line's
East-West trades.

Strategy review

Maersk Line operates in an industry facing two main challenges;
supply and demand imbalances leading to low freight rates and
digitisation. Maersk Line anticipated these challenges and re-

sponded by defining a strategy that focuses on cost leadership,
competitive pricing, improved customer experience, and growth.
The parts are interlinked as cost leadership enables competitive
pricing, which, combined with delivering a great customer ex-
perience, is key to driving growth. Growth in turn strengthens
cost leadership through scale-benefits, and the strategy is thus
a virtuous cycle.

Maersk Line will pursue growth in three ways; organic growth,
digitisation and inorganic growth. Organic growth willbe driven
by improvements in the customer experience and introduction
ofnew solutions together with the other brands in the Transport
& Logistics division. Digitisation will support organic growth via
customer experience improvements, but will also drive growthin
itself through the launch of new revenue generating digital solu-
tions. Maersk Line will pursue inorganic growth through the
intended acquisition of Hamburg Sid, subject to final agreement
and regulatory approvals.

The intended acquisition of Hamburg Siid, will enable Maersk
Line to offer an improved value proposition on its North-South
trades and in the reefer segment. It will also enable network and
procurement cost synergies for Maersk Line and revenue syn-
ergies for APM Terminals.

APM TERMINALS

APM Terminals made a profit of USD 438m (USD 654m) anda
ROIC of 5.7% (10.9%). Operating business generated a profit of
USD 487m (USD 696m) and a ROIC of 8.6% (12.7%) while pro-
jects under implementation together with Grup Maritim TCB
(TCB) had a loss of USD 49m (loss of USD 42m) stemming from
start-up costs.

APM Terminals faced various challenges in its most important

markets. In West Africa, the dominant import markets were
impacted by the low oil price and related shortage of hard cur-
rency. In North-West Europe, gateway and transhipment vol-

= Contents

umes were stagnant while new capacity was brought online.
In general but particularly in North Africa and Latin America,
the shipping line consolidation and alliance re-alignment im-
pacted several APM Terminals facilities as alliances increas-
ingly selected competing terminals according to their equity
stakes.

Furthermore, the consolidation taking place in the shipping
industry means that a smaller group of large liner customers
will remain. Concentrating volumes among fewer alliances
and shipping lines is shifting bargaining power away from
terminals in several locations and puts pressure on rates. APM
Terminals experienced lower volumes in terminals with high
average revenue per move, and despite the TCB acquisition,
total revenue decreased by 1.5%. The average port revenue per
move declined by 9% in 2016 from USD 218 per move in 2015 to
USD 198 per move in 2016.

APM Terminals continued the cost and performance initiatives
introduced in 2015. Operational efficiency initiatives included
deployment of advanced optimisation tools, increased use of
global shared services, consolidation and sharing of adminis-
trative roles and functions between terminals, and other oper-
ational excellence projects. Furthermore, cost saving initiatives
across all entities and headquarters achieved USD 150m in
savings in 2016, contributing to the unit cost reduction from
USD 181 per move to USD 172 per move.

The share of profit in joint ventures and associated compa-
nies was USD 193m (USD 199m).

Cash flow from operating activities was USD 819m (USD 874m).
Cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 1.5bn (USD
774m), mainly due to the TCB acquisition.

APM Terminals’ volume in 2016 was 37.3m TEU (36.0m TEU),
weighted by the share of equity in each terminal; 3.7% higher

s/s >

A.P. Moller - Maersk — Annual Report 2016

than 2015 mainly due to the TCB volumes. Adjusting for TCB
as well as terminals divested in 2015, like-for-like volumes
increased 1%, driven by hub terminals and terminals in North
Asia and South East Asia.

Developments in 2016

APM Terminals acquired eight out of 11 terminals from the
Spanish Grup Maritim TCB's (TCB) port and rail interests. The
acquisition added a combined 2m TEU equity-weighted volume
to APM Terminals, expanding the network to 73 operating
ports in 69 countries.

As part of the TCB transaction, APM Terminals acquired the
Terminal de Contenedores Quetzal (TCQ) in Guatemala. An in-
vestigation revealed irregularities dating back to before APM
Terminals acquired the terminal, and APM Terminals has co-
operated fully with the local authorities in clarifying and set-
tling these. While still subject to Senate approval, a settlement
of USD 43m has been agreed.

Concluding the TCB transaction with the three initially carved
out terminals in Turkey and on the Canary Islands is subject

to the fulfilment of certain conditions precedent, which not all

have been satisfied.

APM Terminals launched the project to build a new five million
TEU capacity terminal in Tangier, Morocco, which is set to be-
come operational in 2019. APM Terminals MedPort Tangier will
have up to 2,000 meters of quay and will increase the Tangier
Med complex's overall capacity to over nine million TEU.

APM Terminals initiated the first phase of an upgrading and
expansion programme for Port Elizabeth, New York, USA,
for the terminal to handle larger vessels arriving via the ex-
panded Panama Canal. APM Terminals signed a contract to
extend the reach of ten Ship-to-Shore (STS) cranes in Pier
400 Los Angeles, California, the largest gateway port in USA.

The STS cranes will be able to accommodate Ultra-Large Con-
tainer Ships of up to 20,000 TEU capacity.

APM Terminals has concluded agreements with China COSCO
Shipping Ports and Oingdao Port International Development to
divest a minority of the existing reefer terminal and the new ter-
minal under construction in Vado, Italy. After completing the
transaction, APM Terminals will retain a 50.1% share and will
operate both terminals.

APM Terminals has entered into an agreement to divest
Pentalver, the UK based provider of container transport and
other container related services. The sales price is around
USD 100m, resulting in a minor gain. The transaction is sub-
ject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be
finalised in Q1 2017.

The market

The port industry is facing structural challenges from the cas-
cading of larger container vessels combined with low demand
growth leading to fewer liner services and fewer, but larger calls
at terminals with more containers to exchange. The increased
load on the terminals triggers requirements for upgrades of the
terminal infrastructure, equipment, manning and planning ca-
pabilities, leading to more capital expenditure and operational
cost, but lower utilisation.

The latest estimate for port container volume growth for 2016
was 1.3% (Drewry 04 forecaster). This covers significant re-
gional differences between Africa (-3.7%) and Latin America
(-3.8%) and Middle East/South Asia (+3.6%); while the largest
markets for APM Terminals in Europe (+1.9%), North America
(+1.5%) and Asia (+1.5%) all showed moderate but positive
growth. Demand growth for 2017 is forecasted at approxi-
mately 2%. Container terminal capacity is increasing in most
markets due to ongoing greenfield and expansion projects in
the pipeline and is leading to oversupply in many ports.

= Contents

This is especially the case in North-West Europe, Scandinavia
and the Baltic countries where the slow economic recovery
is not matching additional capacity being introduced. Demand
growth in the Middle East is similarly far from matching the sig-
nificant capacity increases in the region. With economic growth
and strengthened infrastructure driving industrial demand,
South and South East Asia are promising to be the most sig-
nificant centres of growth. The Chinese market is expected to
grow slightly, mainly due to consumer driven imports and is
expected to result in increasing terminal utilisation.

and re-alignment of alliances requires APM Terminals to rethink
the commercial approach. As a response, working together
with Maersk Line in the Transport & Logistics division will
not only increase utilisation, but also allow Maersk Line to im-
prove network efficiency based on APM Terminals’ hubs and
to develop joint initiatives to improve productivity and cost.
At the same time, closer cooperation and strategic partner-
ships with other shipping lines and alliances are being pur-
sued in key locations.

APM Terminals will focus on completing new terminals cur-
rently under implementation within time and budget, as well as
developing the service offering to landside customers and users
in the ports and inland locations. This includes continuing to
develop digital solutions supporting an improved customer ex-
perience across the facilities. Active portfolio management will
focus on realising value through divestments and pursuing
selected investments in support of the objectives of the Trans-
port & Logistics division.

DAMCO

Damco made a profit of USD 31m (USD 19m) and a ROIC of 14.6%
(7.1%), mainly driven by improvements in supply chain man-
agement, which was partially due to improved processes and
operational efficiencies.

Revenue was USD 2.5bn (USD 2.7bn), down 8.5%, negatively
impacted by lower freight rates and rate of exchange move-
ments. Cost saving initiatives and productivity improvements
positively impacted the underlying profit with an increased
return on sales to 2.2% (1.5%). Damco made improvements in
2016, however, potential remains to further optimise costs and
improve commercial effectiveness.

Volumes in supply chain management saw a growth of 2%
in 2016, while air and ocean freight volumes grew by 5% and
6% respectively. Within freight forwarding, increased sales

efforts and focus on selected trade lanes enabled Damco to
grow ahead of the market, however margins continued to be
under pressure.

Cash flow from operating activities was USD 4m (USD 127m),
significantly lower due to one-off working capital improvements
in 2015 following the roll-out of a new operating system in 2014.

Developments in 2016

Damco embarked on a journey of transformation within its
supply chain management product offering. By launching anew
service portfolio, Damco allows customers to manage complex
multi-party supply-chains, delivering new integrated enterprise
level business intelligence capabilities. Focus has also been on
launching a new digital application factory to support specific
customer demands.

The market

The logistics market remained under pressure, especially dur-
ing the first three quarters of 2016, whereas 04 showed some
improvements in both ocean and airfreight volumes.

Strategy review

Supply chain management, ocean and airfreight remain the
major products for Damco, while the focus going forward will
be on intensifying development of supply chain solutions.

The ambition for Damco is to combine a strong global network
with digital innovation. The strategic focus will be on elevating
supply chain solutions and accelerating performance through
further cost reduction and revenue growth. Furthermore,
Damco will enhance the creation of innovative digital supply
chain solutions in collaboration with its customers.

Within the Transport & Logistics division, Damco will collab-
orate closely with the other businesses, driving synergies for
improved product offering and better customer experience.

SVITZER
Svitzer delivered a profit of USD 91m (USD 120m) and a ROIC
of 7.5% (10.9%).

Profit declined due to increased competition and lower activity
levels, primarily within harbour towage in the Americas and
salvage.

Despite fierce competition, overcapacity and slowdown in
most shipping segments, Svitzer maintained its market share
in competitive ports both in Australia and Europe. Low com-
modity prices lead to increased pressure on existing contracts
as well as to limited growth prospects in terminal towage.
Salvage activity continued to be affected by weak emergency
response market.

Svitzer addresses the general slowdown and overcapacity
by continuously monitoring and adjusting tonnage and crew
deployment. Underlying profitability improved through pro-
ductivity and cost saving initiatives in harbour towage. Posi-
tive impacts were offset with high cost related to Brazil entry
end 2015, which resulted in an EBITDA margin of 25.9% (28.4%).

Cash flow from operating activities increased to USD 144m
(USD 138m). Cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD
192m (USD 152m).

Developments in 2016

Svitzer expanded into new markets, most notably in the
Americas, with a new operation to provide towage services
at two LNG terminals in Argentina as well as a new harbour
towage service in Canada.

Svitzer continued the business development focus on the large

and fast growing towage markets such as in Asia and worked

The market

A slowdown induced by low commodity prices continues to
impact several of Svitzer's operations. The market for harbour
towage continues to be very competitive in developed markets
and consolidation is ongoing, also driven by the financial dis-
tress of several operators.

The terminal towage activities remain negatively impacted by
the current oil price environment, where the oil and gas indus-
try is cutting costs to adapt to a lower oil price level, leading to
delays in tender awards, postponements of new projects and
renegotiation pressure on existing contracts. The few projects
that are being tendered attract low return bids from all interna-
tional providers. The low oil price makes it difficult to employ
vessels and the high number of unutilised vessels in the mar-
ket puts further pressure on day rates.

Strategy review

Svitzer will increasingly pursue opportunities in cooperating
with APM Terminals and Maersk Line in the Transport &
Logistics division.

ENERGY DIVISION

MAERSK OIL

Maersk Oil reported a profit of USD 477m (loss of USD 2.1bn in
2015 where the result was negatively impacted by post-tax im-
pairments of USD 2.6bn) and a positive ROIC of 11.4% (negative
38.6%). The result was delivered under significantly challenged
market conditions with low oil prices, in particular in the begin-
ning of the year where the Brent oil price reached a low of USD
27 per barrel.

The underlying profit of USD 497m (USD 435m) was positively
impacted by higher production efficiency, lower operating costs
of USD 2.0bn (USD 2.5bn), lower exploration costs of USD 223m.
(USD 423m) and reduction of abandonment provision related to
the fully depreciated Leadon and Janice fields in the UK of USD
93m. The result was negatively affected by the lower average oil
price of USD 44 per barrel versus USD 52 per barrel in 2015. The
break-even oil price was below USD 40 per barrel for the year.

Cash flow from operating activities was USD 1.5bn (USD 1.8bn),
negatively impacted by a one-off dispute settlement in O1. Cash
flow used for capital expenditure was USD 1.7bn, 17% lower than
in 2015 (USD 2.0bn) and mainly related to Johan Sverdrup in
Norway and Culzean in the UK.

Maersk Oil delivered an entitlement production of 313,000 boepd
(312,000 boepd) which was lower than latest guidance of 320,000-
330,000 boepd as a result of the higher than expected oil price
giving less barrels for cost recovery in Qatar. This was partly
countered by a strong operational performance in particular in
the UK and a production increase to 9,000 boepd from the Jack
field in the US Gulf of Mexico. The increases were offset by the
natural field decline in Denmark of 9% and the sale of the pro-
ducing asset in Brazil. Production efficiency was close to 90%,
an increase of 6.6%-points over the last two years.

Maersk Oil reduced operating costs, excluding exploration costs,
by 20% to USD 2.0bn (USD 2.5bn). The targeted 20% reduction
by the end of 2016 compared to the 2014 baseline was improved
to 36%. 2016 contributed well to this result through a headcount
reduction of approximately 400 employees equal to 8% of the

workforce, primarily in headquarters, Kazakhstan, Norway,
USA and Angola. Offshoring of back office finance activities to
the shared service centre in Pune, India, was executed accord-
ing to plan. Further reductions came from contract renegotia-
tions, optimised logistics and continued improvement of main-
tenance planning and management of late life assets.

Exploration costs were reduced by 47% to USD 223m (USD
423m), in line with the strategic decisions to reduce exploration
expenditure and to focus on the North Sea and on locations
with high profitability and strong capability fit. Maersk Oil only
completed one exploration well in 2016. The Bagpuss explora-
tion well in the UK encountered hydrocarbons, however not in
commercially viable volumes.

Reserves and resources

The yearly update of Maersk Oil's reserves and resources as per
end of 2015 showed entitlement reserves and resources (2P+2C)
of 1.14bn barrels of oil equivalent (1.31bn) including proved and
probable (2P) reserves of 0.65bn barrels of oil equivalent (0.51bn).
Reserves and resources numbers for 2016 will be released in
connection with the Interim Report for 012017.

Developments in 2016

Two major development projects in the North Sea were in pro-
gress by the end of 2016. The Maersk Oil operated Culzean field
is a high-pressure/high-temperature gas project expected to
supply the UK with 5% of its gas consumption by 2020. Drilling
of production wells commenced in 03 2016 and first production
is planned in the second half of 2019. The project is progressing
as planned and has achieved cost reductions of USD 500m or
11% of total development cost since sanctioning in 2015.

Development of the Johan Sverdrup field in Norway is pro-
gressing ahead of schedule towards first production in 2019
and with the operator Statoil now forecasting a break-even
price per barrel below USD 20 for the first phase.

A.P. Moller - Maersk — Annual Report 2016

In the Danish sector of the North Sea, the Tyra facilities are ap-
proaching the end of their operational life due to acombination
of more than 30 years of production and subsidence of the
underground chalk reservoir, reducing the gap between the
facilities and the sea. Work to identify a safe scenario for pro-
duction at the Tyra field after 2018 was conducted. However,
discussions between the oil and gas industry and the Danish
government on fiscal structures have not yet led to an economi-
cally viable solution for continued operations after 2018.

In Kenya, the South Lokichar project is progressing with ap-
proval of a four-well exploration and appraisal programme.
Work is ongoing to construct an early production facility as
well as to design a pipeline to cater for future oil export.

Ongoing development projects also include Jack in the US
Gulf of Mexico, which is progressing to produce above expec-
tations and where a second phase including two more wells
was approved in early 2016. In the UK, the Flyndre field is ex-
pected on stream in 02 2017.

Maersk Oil no longer has producing assets in Brazil following
the completion of the divestment of the Polvo Field.

Maersk Oil signed agreements to divest the non-operated inter-
ests in the UK assets Wytch Farm, Scott, Telford and Boa, and
the non-operated interests in the Norwegian assets Zidane and
the Polarled Pipeline. The divestments are pending approval
from authorities and will deliver minor gains. Furthermore,
Maersk Oil decided to cease production from the Janice oil field
in the UK. Also in the UK, decommissioning projects Leadon
and Janice are ongoing.

Maersk Oil is working to deliver safe and efficient operations at
Al Shaheen in the remaining months ofits licence and will exit
Qatar in July 2017 following transition to a new operator.

The authorities in the UK enacted a more beneficial tax legis-
lation, resulting in a minor net loss in 2016 due to reduction of
deferred tax assets. This comprises a reduction of the Supple-
mentary Tax Charge from 20% to 10% (resulting in a reduction
of total income tax from 50% to 40%) and abolition of the Petro-
leum Revenue Tax.

The market

The oil industry experienced a steep oil price decline from above
USD 100 per barrel in the first half of 2014. The Brent oil price
reached a low of USD 27 per barrel in 01 2016, and was around
USD 50 per barrel by the end of the year resulting in an average
of USD 44 per barrel in 2016. Global demand and supply appear
now to be re-balancing, however significant uncertainty remains
in the oil price outlook.

Maersk Oil has adapted its portfolio, organisation and cost level
to the lower oil price environment. Together with good opera-
tional performance, this has allowed Maersk Oil to improve the
competitiveness with a break-even oil price reduced from USD
55-60 per barrel in 2014 to below USD 40 per barrel in 2016 and
with a target of USD 40-45 per barrel for 2017 onwards exclud-
ing Qatar.

Strategy review

Maersk Oil will continue its strategy implementation to solidify
its position as a leading North Sea operator with international
step-outs.

Maersk Oil will focus on its three-pillar strategy; maximise
value from safe operations, world-class project delivery and
build the future business. This is to be achieved through a con-
tinued focus on improved safety, efficiency and cost control
across operations, thereby delivering short-term cash flow and
further ensure world-class delivery of projects like Culzean and
Johan Sverdrup securing medium-term production.

= Contents

Finally Maersk Oil will build the future business by engaging
in structural solutions such as mergers and joint ventures in
the North Sea, where it can build on an extensive experience,
leverage capabilities and footprint to create value for share-
holders and partners. Maersk Oil will also evaluate its portfolio
outside the North Sea and focus in locations with high profita-
bility and strong capability fit.

In line with the new strategy, Maersk Oil will prepare for sepa-
ration from AP. Moller - Maersk.

MAERSK DRILLING

Maersk Drilling made a loss of USD 694m (profit of USD 751m)
and a ROIC of negative 9.0% (positive 9.3%). The result was
negatively impacted by impairments of USD 1.5bn (USD 27m),
primarily related to the deepwater segment due to significant
oversupply and reduced long-term demand expectations as a
consequence of lower offshore spending. The underlying profit
of USD 743m (USD 732m) was positively impacted by termina-
tion fees of approximately USD 150m moved from 2017 to 2016,
savings on operating costs and high operational uptime offset
by ten rigs being idle or partly idle versus three rigs last year.
The financial effect from the increased number of rigs without
contract reduced the result in 04 significantly.

The termination fees included the ultra-deepwater semi-sub-
mersible Meersk Deliverer during Q1, the deepwater unit
Maersk Valiant and the jack-up Maersk Resolve with effect
from September 2016. The jack-up Meersk Gallant was also ter-
minated, although Maersk Drilling concurrently signed a new
contract in direct continuation of the cancelled contract, result-
ing in a neutral financial impact.

The cost reduction and efficiency enhancement programme,

initiated in 2014, delivered further savings of more than 10%
in 2016, excluding positive effect from exchange rates and rigs

420/15

A.P. Moller - Maersk — Annual Report 2016

being stacked. Compared to the 2014 baseline, the total savings
reached around 20% by the end of 2016, and all targets set out
for this programme have been met, however, further savings
will still be a central focus area going forward. The savings have
primarily been achieved through a strong focus on operating
and maintenance costs, but also by optimising yard stays, ven-
dor renegotiations, reduction of staff onshore, rig crew optimi-
sation as well as salary reductions and salary freezes.

The economic utilisation of the fleet was 78% (85%) adversely
affected by increased idle time. The average operational up-
time was 98% (98%) for the jack-up rigs and 98% (94%) for
the floaters.

Maersk Drilling’s forward coverage at the end of 2016 was 56%

for 2017, 45% for 2018 and 25% for 2019. The total revenue back-
log by the end of the year amounted to USD 3.7bn (USD 5.4bn).

Despite lower revenue, cash flow from operating activities of
USD 1.3bn (USD 1.3bn) was an increase of USD 62m which was
mainly related to termination fees, further cost savings and
lower working capital. Cash flow used for capital expenditure
declined to USD 315m (USD 854m), mainly due to fewer instal-
ments paid for the newbuild projects as well as delayed deliv-
ery of Maersk Invincible into January 2017.

Stacking

At year-end, Maersk Drilling had Meersk Developer preparing
for a contract in Q2 2017, as well as nine rigs idled and off con-
tract. As the market outlook for the offshore drilling industry
remains highly uncertain, Maersk Drilling continues to evalu-
ate stacking on a case-by-case basis. Ahead of rigs becoming idle,
Maersk Drilling assesses the most attractive stacking conditions
and locations for the rigs in balanced consideration of commer-
cial outlook, maintenance plans and costs as well as portfolio
considerations. So far, this strategy has resulted in all idle rigs
currently being warm-stacked.

Developments in 2016

Maersk Drilling was awarded a contract by Maersk Oil for the
jack-up rig Mersk Gallant. The contract covers the plugging
and abandonment of the Leadon and James subsea fields in the
UK sector of the North Sea. The duration of the contract is esti-
mated at 230 days with commencement in February 2017. The
estimated contract revenue is USD 24m.

Maersk Drilling acquired a contracted newbuild harsh envi-
ronment jack-up rig for USD 190m, significantly below original
construction price. The Maersk Highlander has commenced
operations on the Culzean field in the UK sector of the North
Sea for Maersk Oil. Maersk Highlander is employed under a
five-year contract with a revenue of approximately USD 420m.

The delivery of Maersk Drilling’s fourth and final newbuild ultra
harsh environment jack-up rig on order, the Maersk Invincible,

= Contents

was delayed from 2016 to January 2017. The rig will commence a
five-year drilling contract in 02 2017.

Maersk Guardian has been refurbished and has commenced on
its five-year contract as an accommodation rig for Maersk Oil
in the Danish sector of the North Sea.

The market

Offshore contract drilling is in the middle of the worst downturn
in the history of the industry, and the industry is expected to
continue to deteriorate over the near-term with further declines
in rig activity levels and offshore capital spending in 2017.

Brent crude oil prices averaged USD 44 per barrel in 2016, still
well below levels required to support a sustained increase in
offshore rig demand. The industry does not expect to see sig-
nificant improvements in offshore rig demand until the market
reaches a stable oil price range of USD 60-70 per barrel or until
offshore rig cost levels adjust to a lower oil price.

Market shifts have resulted in offshore exploration and pro-
duction spending declining from a high of USD 290bn in 2014
to a projected USD 190bn in 2016, representing a decline of 34%
(Rystad Energy). Offshore spending is expected to decline a
further 10-20% in 2017, with further risk of decline if oil prices
trade at lower levels or if onshore oil production proves more
resilient than expected.

The decline in offshore spending and rig activity levels has
led to total industry utilisation falling from a peak of 89% in
04 2013 to current levels of 56% in 04 2016. The extent of the
decline in the industry is now more severe than the downturn
in the mid-1980s.

At present, global rig supply holds significant excess capac-

ity, as approximately 130 floaters and 230 jack-up rigs have
been stacked, while the newbuild order book still comprises

4d avs >


--- Page 19 ---

A.P. Moller - Maersk — Annual Report 2016

approximately 40 floaters and 100 jack-up rigs scheduled for
delivery, the vast majority of which do not have contracts.
This confluence of factors is driving the need for a significant
scrapping cycle to resolve the imbalance between supply and
demand in the market.

Strategy review

Maersk Drilling remains committed to delivering best-in-class
drilling services to its customers. Maersk Drilling will con-
tinue to leverage its long-standing history of technical prob-
lem solving, focusing on operational excellence and working
closely with customers in order to drive higher efficiency
levels and joint value creation for both Maersk Drilling and
the customer.

The core elements of Maersk Drilling’s value proposition include
de-risking and reducing customers’ total well costs by actively
collaborating with each individual customer on reduction of
non-productive time and well-spread costs to drive higher busi-
ness case certainty.

Maersk Drilling will continue to pursue superior operational
performance through efficient, consistent and safe high-qual-
ity drilling operations based on a commitment to continuous
improvements and well-on-well learnings. An example of this
is Maersk Drilling’s announced partnership with GE to collabo-
rate on a technologically advanced, data-driven analytics pilot
project to enhance vessel productivity and to create smarter,
more efficient maintenance schemes.

Maersk Drilling is also exploring alternative ways to employ
rigs, other than traditional drilling contracts, including decom-
missioning and accommodation contracts.

In line with the new strategy, Maersk Drilling will prepare for
separation from A.P. Moller - Maersk.

MAERSK SUPPLY SERVICE

Maersk Supply Service reported a loss of USD 1.2bn (profit of
USD 147m) and a ROIC of negative 76.7% (positive 8.5%), nega-
tively impacted by an impairment of USD 1.2bn due to signifi-
cant oversupply and reduced long-term demand expectations
as a consequence of lower offshore spending. The underlying
result was a loss of USD 44m (profit of USD 117m).

Revenue decreased to USD 386m (USD 613m) following lower
rates and lower utilisation as well as fewer vessel days available
due to divestments and lay-ups. The lower revenue was partly
offset by cost reductions with total operating costs at USD 282m
(USD 345m). Maersk Supply Service reduced the daily running
costs by 11% compared to 2015 on a like-for-like basis in 2016.

Cash flow from operating activities decreased to USD 81m (USD
250m) primarily caused by a lower result. Cash flow used for
capital expenditure decreased to USD 103m (USD 206m).

Going into 2017, contract coverage was 16% and 5% for 2018.

Developments in 2016

During 2016, Maersk Supply Service divested ten vessels, thereby
reducing its fleet to 47 vessels by the end of 2016. Maersk Supply
Service is planning to reduce its fleet by an additional 11 vessels
over the course of the next 15 months.

Maersk Supply Service also announced that the four new Sting-
ray Subsea Support Vessels (SSV) that are being delivered in
2017 and 2018 will be flagged to the Isle of Man registry. Maersk
Supply Service will be setting up a hub in the UK, consolidating
ownership and operation of the company’s total of nine project
vessels. As a consequence of the fleet reduction and the flagging
of existing project vessels to the Isle of Man registry, the Maersk
Supply Service crew pool and the onshore organisation were
reduced. A total of 325 offshore employees and 43 headquarter
positions were made redundant.

= Contents

Maersk Supply Service was awarded two decommissioning
contracts for the Janice subsea field and the Leadon subsea
field with Maersk Oil in 2016. The decommissioning work will
utilise up to 15 of the company’s vessels in 2017, including one
of the Stingray SSV newbuildings and one of the Starfish
Anchor Handling Tug Supply (AHTS) newbuildings.

Maersk Supply Service took delivery of a new SSV in 2016,
which went on a seven-year contract. The total order book
commitment of USD 0.9bn comprises ten vessels with planned
delivery from Q1 2017 to Q1 2018.

The market

The market demand remains low due to the low oil price, and
the general market outlook for the industry is expected to
remain subdued in the long term. The industry is currently
characterised by financial restructurings and consolidation.
In line with market decline, the offshore supply vessel indus-
try continued to see a large number of vessel lay-ups globally,
including Maersk Supply Service with 11 vessels laid up at the
end of the year.

Strategy review

Maersk Supply Service has announced a new Integrated
Solutions business that will support the company’s ambition
to become a leading integrator of marine services and solutions
for the offshore energy sector. With vessel operations remain-
ing the core business, Maersk Supply Service will in addition
bundle services and manage subcontractors to offer a more
simplified and efficient operation to customers seeking better
value from their operations and supply base.

In line with the new strategy, Maersk Supply Service will pre-
pare for separation from A-P. Moller - Maersk.

A.P. Moller - Maersk — Annual Report 2016

MAERSK TANKERS

Maersk Tankers reported a profit of USD 62m (USD 160m) and
a ROIC of 3.7% (9.9%). The result was negatively impacted by
declining rates, but partly offset by improved commercial per-
formance, contract coverage and cost savings.

Maersk Tankers’ response to the declining market conditions
was to continue to deliver on its strategy. Through improved
commercial decisions, Maersk Tankers’ average Time Charter
Equivalent (TCE) earnings decreased by 17% compared to 2015,
which was less than the general market rates decline. The re-
sult also benefited from cost saving initiatives, which reduced
costs by USD 30m.

Cash flow from operating activities was USD 180m (USD 291m).
Net cash flow from capital expenditure was USD 190m (USD
185m) driven by newbuilding instalments, partly offset by the
sale of four vessels. Maersk Tankers took delivery of six mid-
range tanker newbuildings during 2016. The order book totals
11 remaining mid-range (MR) product tankers, of which five
will be delivered during 2017 and the last six in 2018 as well as
an option for ten Long Range 2 (LR2) product tanker vessels.

Developments in 2016

Maersk Tankers signed a contract with Dalian Shipyard for a
newbuilding order of ten LR2 product tanker vessels for delivery
over a period of three years, with the first vessels entering the
fleet in 2019. The newbuilding contract is part ofa fleet renewal to
sustain a competitive fleet and strong market position in the LR2
segment. The contract reflects the decline in asset prices over the
last 12 months. In addition it has a unique contractual structure,
which makes the order optional, while keeping prices fixed.

The market

The product tanker market across all segments was challenged
in 2016 with rates in several markets declining up to 50%
compared to 2015. Starting off strong at the beginning of the

year, rates experienced a gradual decline and bottomed out
at the end of the third quarter before improving end of 2016.
Overall, the deterioration of product tanker rates in 2016 was
caused by slowing demand growth for seaborne transporta-
tion, a draw-down of oil inventories and an increased number
of newbuilding deliveries.

Geographical arbitrage opportunities also weakened through-
out the year, which ultimately shortened average trading dis-
tances. Utilisation was negatively impacted by a sharp increase
in newbuilding deliveries and relatively low scrapping. As a
result, net fleet growth registered more than 5% in 2016, dou-
bling the growth rate in 2015.

Strategy review
Maersk Tankers continues to deliver on its strategy while keep-
ing new investments limited.

The strategy is based on digitisation across the priorities; ac-
tive position taking, cost leadership and third party services.
Through active position taking, internal and external data are
combined and used in commercial decisions to more accurately
forecast which markets and cargo yield highest earnings, so that
vessels can be positioned accordingly. Through cost leadership,
Maersk Tankers is reducing costs by creating higher efficiencies
in systems and processes and improving procurement leverage.
By providing third party services, the company operates other
owners’ vessels against a fee to achieve scale, strong partner-
ships and income without having to invest.

Maersk Tankers operated 158 product tanker vessels at the end
of 2016, of which 84 were owned, 22 chartered and 52 vessels
were on commercial management. Combined, these vessels
comprise the largest product tanker fleet in the industry.

In line with the new strategy, Maersk Tankers will prepare for
separation from A-P. Moller - Maersk.

A.P. Moller - Maersk — Annual Report 2016

FINANCIAL
REPORT

INCOME STATEMENT

Revenue decreased to USD 35.5bn (USD 40.3bn), predominantly
due to lower average container freight rates and lower oil price
only partly compensated by higher oil entitlement production.
The operating expenses decreased by USD 2.6bn mainly due
to lower bunker prices and focus on cost efficiency across busi-
ness units.

AP. Moller - Maersk delivered an unsatisfactory loss of USD 1.9bn.
(profit of USD 925m). The result was negatively impacted by
low average container freight rates and post-tax impairments
in Maersk Drilling and Maersk Supply Service of USD 1.4bn
and USD 1.2bn respectively, partly offset by termination fees in
Maersk Drilling and cost savings across all businesses. The result
for 2015 was negatively impacted by post-tax impairments of
USD 2.6bn on oil assets.

Further comments to the profit development are provided in
the Highlights and the Financial review for the businesses.

TAX

Companies in A-P. Moller - Maersk are taxed under different tax
regimes, depending on location and activity. Special tax rules
apply to some of A.P. Moller - Maersk’s activities.

Generally, shipping activities are subject to a tonnage based or
similar tax system, under which the computation of taxable in-
come includes an amount, calculated on the basis of the fleet's
tonnage. Moreover, in certain countries freight taxes are paid
mainly based on the gross freight income in those countries.

In most countries, oil and gas activities are subject to a special
form of taxation, which is often considerably higher than the
normal corporate tax rate.

Despite the consolidated negative result before tax, taxes are
still payable in various countries as a result of local profits, ring

= Contents

fencing of oil profits, timing differences in adjustments and
fixed tonnage-based taxes, which also limit the deduction of
carry forward operational losses and recognition of tax assets
in balance-sheet.

The total tax charge for A-P. Moller - Maersk in 2016 was USD
1.1bn (USD 0.5bn) of which taxes payable to Denmark were USD
O.1bn (USD 0.2bn). The decrease in the special hydrocarbon tax
was largely due to the lower oil price.

TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

Total comprehensive income for the year was negative by
USD 2.3bn (positive USD 540m) and includes the loss for the
year of USD 1.9bn (profit of USD 925m) and other comprehen-
sive income, which was negative by USD 401m (negative by
USD 385m). Other comprehensive income mainly includes
exchange rate adjustment on translation from functional
currency to presentation currency, fair value adjustment of
certain securities, value adjustment of cash flow hedges and
actuarial gains and losses.

BALANCE SHEET
At 31 December 2016, total assets amounted to USD 61.1bn
(USD 62.4bn).

Intangible assets of USD 3.6 bn (USD 1.9bn) increased due to
the APM Terminals acquisition of Grup Maritim TCB.

Property, plant and equipment of USD 41.5bn (USD 44.0bn)
decreased by USD 2.5bn. Investments in the year amounted to
USD 4.4bn (USD 7.3bn). Depreciation for the year was USD 4.3bn
(USD 4.6bn) and impairment losses of USD 2.4bn (losses of USD
2.1bn) were recognised. Sale of property, plant and equipment
amounted to USD 375m (USD 773m) including the assets held
for sale. Currency adjustments resulted in a decrease of USD
168m (decrease of USD 435m).

Predicting the value and future income streams from assets in
the current depressed markets remains uncertain. For further
description of significant accounting estimates and judgements
cf. note 23 in the Consolidated financial statements.

Derivatives as of 31 December 2016 were a net liability of USD
887m (net liability of USD 837m). Cash and bank balances
totalled USD 4.1bn (USD 4.0bn) at 31 December 2016, including
offsetting bank overdrafts of USD 47m (USD 12m). Cash and
bank balances include USD 1.1bn (USD 1.2bn) that relates to
balances in countries with exchange control or other restric-
tions. These funds are not readily available for general use by
the parent company or other subsidiaries.

Equity totalled USD 32.1bn (USD 35.7bn). The decrease was
related to the loss for the year of USD 1.9bn, ordinary dividend
paid of USD 1.0bn (USD 1.0bn), the share buy-back of USD 475m,
and other comprehensive income of negative USD 401m.

The actuarial net liability for pensions, etc. in relation to de-
fined benefit plans recognised totalled USD 142m (USD 131m)
at 31 December 2016. Developments in the actuarial assump-
tions as well as changes to the minimum funding require-
ments resulted in actuarial losses of USD 96m (gains of USD
68m), which are included in other comprehensive income.
AP. Moller - Maersk paid USD 78m (USD 116m) to defined ben-
efit plans in 2016.

Deferred tax liabilities totalled USD 605m (USD 280m) at

31 December 2016, and recognised deferred tax assets totalled
USD 590m (USD 891m). Furthermore, deferred tax assets of
USD 2.0bn (USD 1.9bn) have not been recognised, cf. note 8 in
the Consolidated financial statements.

CASH FLOW
Cash flow from operating activities was USD 4.3bn (USD 8.0bn)
impacted by the lower profit, higher net working capital anda

one-off dispute settlement in Maersk Oil. Net cash flow used for
capital expenditure was USD 4.4bn (USD 6.3bn excluding the
sale of shares in Danske Bank of USD 4.9bn).

OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS

The present value of operating lease commitments totalled

USD 7.0bn at 31 December 2016 (USD 7.0bn at 31 December 2015)

using a discount rate of 6% (6%). The amount is divided into

the following main items:

e Maersk Line and Maersk Tankers of USD 2.7bn (USD 3.3bn)
primarily relating to vessels on time charter

¢ APM Terminals of USD 3.5bn (USD 2.9bn) primarily related
to future concession fees for port facilities

e Other commitments of USD 0.8bn (USD 0.8bn).

About 40% of the time charter payments in Maersk Line and
about one third in Maersk Tankers are estimated to relate to
operational costs for the assets, cf. note 17 in the Consolidated
financial statements.

CONSOLIDATION

The Consolidated financial statements of AP. Moller - Maersk
are included in the consolidated financial statements of
AP. Moller Holding A/S.

Q4 2016
FINANCIALS

A.P. Moller - Maersk reported a loss of USD 2.7bn
(loss of USD 2.5bn) negatively impacted by im-
pairments of USD 1.5bn in Maersk Drilling and
USD 1.1bn in Maersk Supply Service. The result
or 2015 was impacted by post-tax impairments
of USD 2.56n on oil assets. ROIC was negative
21.2% (negative 20.8%). The underlying loss of
USD 63m (loss of USD 9m) was mainly due to
ower underlying profit in Maersk Drilling due to
more idle rigs, and higher net financial items due
to higher debt and negative currency effects,
partly offset by higher underlying profit in
Maersk Oil.

Free cash flow generation came at USD 522m (USD 498m) with
net cash flow used for capital expenditure at USD 943m (USD
1.6bn) while cash flow from operating activities remained high
at USD 1.5bn (USD 2.0bn).

Maersk Line reported a loss of USD 146m (loss of USD 182m)
and a ROIC of negative 2.9% (negative 3.6%).

Revenue increased 2.4% to USD 5.3bn (USD 5.2bn). The devel-
opment was driven by volumes increasing 12% to 2,701k FFE
(2,404k FFE) partly offset by freight rates decreasing 7.1% to
1,804 USD/FFE (1,941 USD/FFE). Freight rates declined across
all trades excluding Europe mainly as a result of the imbalance
between supply and demand built up in earlier periods.

= Contents

Global container demand is estimated to have grown around
4% in 04 2016. The growth was primarily driven by solid de-
mand on East-West and Intra-regional trades while container
volumes on the North-South trades remain subdued. The global
container fleet grew around 2%.

The EBIT margin gap to peers (adjusted for impairments, etc.)
‘was around 6%-points in 03 2016 (5%-points).

Unit cost at floating bunker of 1,973 USD/FFE (2,160 USD/FFE)
‘was 8.7% (187 USD/FFE) lower than the same period last year
driven by improved fleet utilisation and cost efficiencies. Total
bunker cost increased by 26% and the bunker price increased
by 11%. Bunker efficiency deteriorated by 0.4% to 912 kg/FFE

(909 kg/FFE). Unit cost at fixed bunker price was 10% below
Q4 2015.

Maersk Line delivered a free cash flow of USD 229m (USD 188m),
significantly impacted by positive working capital effects
of USD 172m (USD 351m) due to timing of vendor payments
around year-end.

APM Terminals recorded a profit of USD 87m (USD 128m) and
a ROIC of 4.4% (8.3%). Operating business generated a profit
of USD 111m (USD 138m) while projects under implementation
together with TCB had a loss of USD 24m (loss of USD 10m)
stemming from start-up costs. The lower profit was mainly
attributable to terminals in oil exporting countries in Africa.

Throughput increased by 10.5% compared to 04 2015 mainly
due to TCB volume. Like-for-like throughput increased by 3.4%.
The latest estimate for port container volume growth for 04

2016 was above 1% (Drewry 04 forecaster).

Damco delivered a profit of USD 4m (USD 1m) driven by over-
head cost reductions and growth in supply chain management
activities partially offset by a negative development in freight
forwarding products, driven by low freight margins.

Ocean and airfreight volumes grew 9% and 3%, respectively,
while supply chain management volumes improved by 6%.

Svitzer reported a profit of USD 18m (USD 29m) and a ROIC of
6.0% (10.4%).

Revenue decreased by USD 15m as a result of lower volumes in
harbour towage and weaker GBP against USD. Negative effects
were partly offset with new terminal towage activity and tariff
increase in Australia.

Profitability improved through productivity and cost saving in-
itiatives in harbour towage. Positive impacts from operational
efficiencies, lower bunker cost and effects from weaker GBP
against USD, were offset by start-up cost in Argentina resulting
in EBITDA margin of 23.5% (22.8%).

Cash flow from operating activities increased to USD 26m (USD
19m). Cash flow used for capital expenditure was USD 41m
(USD 10m).

Maersk Oil reported a profit of USD 230m (loss of USD 2.5bn in-
cluding post-tax impairments of USD 2.6bn) with a positive ROIC
of 21.9% (negative 214.3%) mainly impacted by lower operating
costs, higher production efficiency, reduction of abandonment
provision of USD 93m and a higher oil price. The underlying
profit was USD 250m (loss of USD 21m).

Entitlement production decreased to 276,000 boepd (333,000

boepd) due to planned and unplanned shutdowns, fewer cost
recovery barrels from Qatar as well as lower production from
mature fields mainly in the UK and Denmark.

Operating costs excluding exploration were reduced by 19%
and exploration costs decreased by 13% compared to 04 2015.

Investments decreased by 53% in 04 mainly due to reductions
in Oatar following end of the FDP 2012 and reductions in the UK.

Maersk Oil signed agreements to divest its interests in the non-
operated UK assets Wytch Farm, Scott, Telford and Boa and
the non-operated interests in the Norwegian assets Zidane and
the Polarled Pipeline. The divestments are pending approval
from authorities.

Maersk Drilling reported a loss of USD 1.4bn due to recognition
of the impairment loss of USD 1.5bn before tax and USD 1.4bn

after tax. The underlying profit decreased to USD 16m (USD
176m) negatively impacted by more rigs being idle. ROIC was
negative 80.8% (positive 9.0%).

The average operational uptime was 99% (97%) for the jack-up
rigs and 98% (90%) for the floating rigs.

Maersk Drilling secured one new contract with estimated reve-
nue of USD 12m.

The delivery of Maersk Drilling’s fourth and final newbuild
ultra harsh environment jack-up rig on order, the Maersk
Invincible, was delayed from expected delivery in 04 2016 to
January 2017.

Maersk Supply Service reported a loss of USD 1.1bn (USD Om)
and a ROIC of negative 392.3% (0.0%) impacted by the impair-
ment of USD 1.1bn. The underlying result was a loss of USD 23m.
(loss of USD Om).

Revenue decreased to USD 80m (USD 128m) as a result of lower
rates and utilisation as well as fewer vessels available for trad-
ing due to divestments and lay-ups.

Total operating costs decreased to USD 64m (USD 88m) pri-
marily due to fewer operating vessels and reduced running
costs.

Maersk Supply Service had 11 vessels in lay-up end of year.

Maersk Tankers recorded a loss of USD 13m (profit of USD
30m) and ROIC was negative 3.0% (positive 7.3%). The result
was negatively impacted by lower market rates, partly offset
by improved commercial performance, increased contract cov-
erage and cost savings.

A.P. Moller - Maersk — Annual Report 2016

Other businesses recorded a loss of USD 129m (loss of USD
15m) mainly driven by the impairment of USD 131m in the
RORO business.

Unallocated activities comprise activities which are not at-
tributable to reportable segments, including financial items as
well as centralised purchasing and resale of bunker and lubri-
cating oil to companies in A-P. Moller - Maersk. Financial items,
net, were negative by USD 268m (negative by USD 145m). The
negative development of USD 123m was primarily driven by

RISK
MANAGEMENT

An established Enterprise Risk Management
(ERM) framework is implemented and embedded
in A.P. Moller - Maersk. It encompasses identifying
events or circumstances affecting the achievement
of AP. Moller - Maersk objectives and strategic goals.
Further it presents a framework for assessing the
risks in terms of likelihood and impact, determining
response plans and monitoring progress.

GOVERNANCE AND PROCESS

To obtain the full depiction of the exposure landscape, multiple
types of risks are considered ie. financial, strategic, operational
and compliance risks. In order to support a consistent, robust
and focused approach to risk management; the risks are divided
into three main categories comprising AP. Moller - Maersk’s risk
universe, namely the near term Known Risks, the long-term
Emerging Risks and the industry and geography related Port-
folio Risks.

The three categories are identified through a combination of risk
reporting, cross functional interviews with senior stakeholders,
internal analyses and external expert input. Risk reporting tran-
spires from all businesses in AP. Moller - Maersk and primarily
addresses the operational elements of the exposure. Meanwhile,
the interviews incorporate a wide range of overarching views
on risks with the potential of jeopardising the business objec-
tives. Internal analyses, in turn, provide in-depth knowledge of
selected risks and facilitate AP. Moller - Maersk’s wide overview
and prioritisation. External expertise is sought in assessing
emerging risks and establishing the flag posts for relevant
mega trends.

The main findings are reviewed by the Management Board as
well as the Board of Directors, and serve as input to the annual
strategy and capital allocation processes. Specific risks are reg-
ularly revisited to ensure adequacy and effectiveness of the risk
responses. The Audit Committee annually reviews the process
for adequacy and potential improvements.

THE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The global and multi industrial nature of A-P. Moller - Maersk
makes it subject to a number of risks. These include exposure
stemming from changes to regulatory and operational condi-
tions in certain regions, potential accidents putting employees
or assets at risk, fluctuations in currencies, volatility in freight
rates and oil prices.

= Contents

Several mechanisms are in place to mitigate the gross risks
and limit A.P. Moller - Maersk's exposure, such as elaborate
health, safety and environmental management systems, gov-
ernance frameworks, hedging of exchange rate exposures,
financial policies and insurance activities. Following these
embedded efforts to mitigate and limit the gross risk exposure
of A.P. Moller - Maersk, the most significant residual risks are
consolidated and reported to the Management Board and the
Board of Directors for assessment of the need for further miti-
gating actions and decision on corresponding resource alloca-
tion. In an effort to reduce the exposure even further, the key
residual risks are subsequently addressed through designated
senior management ownership allocation for each risk and
elaboration of additional actions. Twice a year, the action plans
are reviewed for progress and effectiveness.

KNOWN RISKS

Known Risks are considered actual risks to business objectives
within the planning period of five years. Some of the residual
risks in focus for the short to medium-term are:

Strategic review and restructuring. Over the course of 2016,
AP. Moller - Maersk embarked on a wide ranging strategic
review, restructuring and change management processes.
Anumber of inherent transition risks stem from such initi-
atives. The continued imbalances in key markets add to the
complexity, as well as new management teams across most
of the businesses and not least, the prospect of a potential sig-
nificant acquisition completion during 2017 with associated
integration efforts required. Some of the risks revolve around
internal organisational changes, such as ensuring focus on con-
tinued commercial and operational excellence in the businesses
at a time where attention is directed more inward than usual.

Meanwhile, it is imperative to maintain a robust governance

structure to preserve integrity, protect the business and
ensure continued compliance with external regulatory

A.P. Moller - Maersk — Annual Report 2016

requirements during the transition. From an external perspec-
tive, the announced long-term strategic intent of focusing
AP. Moller - Maersk’s portfolio on transport and logistics, while
harbouring many opportunities, also increases the concentra-
tion risk. Focusing on the transport and logistics businesses
raises A.P. Moller - Maersk’s relative exposure to the develop-
ments in global trade and the underlying drivers.

Last, but not least, as with any strategy, there is an execution
risk. In the context of the announced strategy, success rests
on the ability to achieve the intended synergies and deliver
on the expressed aspirations in the digital space and growth
through acquisitions. The above risks are managed through a
structured process and significant management attention and
oversight.

A prolonged period of low freight rates and oil prices. The
subdued freight rates remain a challenge as overcapacity, and
the resulting supply-demand gap, erodes value despite reason-
ably healthy volume growth. The sluggish global economic
growth and rising near shoring and protectionist trends also
continue to weigh on the outlook for container rates. These
risks are addressed by optimisation of the network, increased
utilisation of assets through alliances and a focused effort to
contribute to consolidation in the industry.

The low oil prices naturally have a direct effect on the activity
levels and results in the energy related businesses. Further-
more, in oil dependent economies we have seen the decline in
commodity prices deteriorating the financial and fiscal struc-
tures, while threatening legal, political and social stability,
resulting from heavy reliance on oil and gas revenues. This,
in turn, has the potential for adverse effects on several of the
businesses located in, or exposed to, these regions.

For all the businesses, we continue to focus on being a cost
leader in their industries, and to simplify the organisations.

In the energy businesses this has yielded significantly lower
break even oil prices, allowing for commercial viability even
in the currently difficult market conditions.

Being an operator of large assets, a major accident or oil spill
remains an inherent risk in A-P. Moller - Maersk’s operations,
particularly in the oil and gas, offshore and tanker businesses.
Production and transportation of oil and natural gas, as well as
the operation of large container vessels, are subject to risks such
as technical or operational failures and natural disasters. An ac-
cident could pose a risk to the employees as well as potentially
to the marine environment, wildlife and local communities. Ad-
ditionally it could result in large scale impacts on assets, income
streams, liquidity position and reputation and put the license to
operate at risk. AP. Moller - Maersk is proactively building and
supporting incident free operations to mitigate this risk.

AP. Moller - Maersk is exposed to cyber security threats that
could materially affect operations and the financial condition.
Cyber-attacks targeting systems or production facilities could
result in severe business disruptions and significant losses, as
AP. Moller - Maersk is involved in complex and wide-ranging
global services and engaged in increased digitisation of its
businesses, making it highly dependent on well-functioning IT
systems. The risk is managed through close monitoring and
enhancements of cyber resilience and focus on business conti-
nuity management in the event that IT systems, despite their
efforts, are affected.

EMERGING RISKS

Emerging Risks stem from larger trends, with the potential
of impacting the long-term strategy over 5-10 years. Given
the longevity of the assets and the long-term ambition of
AP. Moller - Maersk, we look beyond the planning horizon in
assessing the risk landscape to ensure the strategy reflects
and encompasses long-term uncertainty. Considering the
relevant time frame for Emerging Risk, mega trends act as

= Contents

guiding principles and shape the thinking. As part of this effort,
AP. Moller - Maersk is particularly monitoring developments
in the sphere of geopolitics and technological progress. Both
dimensions pose a number of opportunities in potentially in-
tensifying global trade flows through trade agreements and
economic growth, or harvesting efficiency gains stemming
from technological development.

Adversely, the trends can develop into threats should they for
instance materialise in reversion of globalised supply chains
driven by geopolitical tensions, increased automation and
rising protectionist measures undermining the long-term out-
look for global trade. An intensification of conflicts in regions
where AP. Moller - Maersk operate more stationary assets or
accelerated shift away from fossil fuels, also pose long term

risks to the businesses, in particular in the terminals and en-
ergy industries. A-P. Moller - Maersk monitors and proactively
seeks to deepen its understanding of these risks, and to take
account of them in its strategy.

PORTFOLIO RISKS

Portfolio Risks reflect the exposure associated with

AP. Moller - Maersk's composition of businesses and choices
of geographic presence. A.P. Moller - Maersk’s portfolio con-
sideration and active management were underpinned by the
2016 strategic review and communicated intent of focusing
AP. Moller - Maersk’s future strategy on transport and logis-
tics. Historic evidence implies that the future narrowing of
the portfolio will on the one hand reduce the risk exposure as
the energy related risks will be reduced, but on the other hand

result in any credit rating deterioration.

The existing structure continues to offer a volatility reduction
of 35% compared to aggregated fluctuations of the individual

folio on average remains in the relatively low risk category due
toa high level of asset and income spread across geographies.

OWN SHARES

The DKK 6.7bn share buy-back programme initiated on

1 September 2015 was concluded on 15 March 2016. The Board
of Directors decided not to initiate a new share buy-back pro-
gramme in 2016. AP. Moller - Meersk A/S’ holding of own shares
comprised 0.37% of the share capital end of 2016, cf. note 9 in
the Consolidated financial statements.

DIVIDEND

Dividend is A-P. Maller - Mzersk A/S’ primary distribution of
capital to its shareholders. A-P. Maller - Mersk A/S’ objective
is to increase the nominal dividend per share over time; sup-
