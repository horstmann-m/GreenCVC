Business overview
History and strategy of TOTAL

1. History and strategy of TOTAL

1.1. History and development

TOTAL S.A., a French société anonyme (limited company)
incorporated on March 28, 1924 is, together with its subsidiaries
and affiliates, the world’s fourth largest publicly-traded integrated oil
and gas company".

With operations in more than 130 countries, TOTAL is engaged in
every sector of the oil and gas industry, including upstream
(hydrocarbon exploration, development and production) and
downstream (refining, petrochemicals, specialty chemicals, trading and
shipping of crude oil and petroleum products and marketing). TOTAL is
also involved in the renewable energies and power generation sectors.

1.2. Strategy

TOTAL began its Upstream operations in the Middle East in 1924.
Since then, the Company has grown and expanded its operations
worldwide. In early 1999, the Company took over PetroFina S.A.
and in early 2000 it took over Elf Aquitaine. Since the repeal in 2002
of the decree of December 13, 1993 that established a golden
share of Elf Aquitaine held by the French government, there are

no longer any agreements or regulatory provisions governing
shareholding relationships between TOTAL and the French
government. Information on TOTAL S.A.’s shareholding structure

is presented in point 4.1 of chapter 8.

TOTAL is a leading international oil and gas company and aims to
be the responsible energy major by helping to supply accessible,
affordable and clean energy to as many people as possible. To
accomplish this goal, TOTAL leverages its integrated business
model, which enables it to capture synergies between the different
activities of the Group. To achieve its ambition, TOTAL relies upon
its operational excellence, technological expertise and capacity to
manage complex projects.

The Group's strategy is based on four main priorities:

- driving profitable, sustainable growth in

Exploration & Production's hydrocarbon activities, with priority
given to reducing production costs, disciplined investments and
cash flow generation;

continuing to enhance the competitiveness of major integrated
refining and petrochemical platforms;

increasing the distribution of petroleum products, particularly in
high-growth regions, and offering innovative solutions and
services that meet customers’ evolving needs above and beyond
the supply of petroleum products; and

(1) Based on market capitalization (in dollars) as of December 31, 2016.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016

- expanding along the full gas value chain by unlocking access to
new markets, and developing profitable low-carbon businesses,
in particular renewable energies.

This strategy incorporates the challenges of climate change, using
as a point of reference the 2°C scenario of the International Energy
Agency and its impact on energy markets. TOTAL’s challenge is to
increase access to affordable energy to satisfy the needs of a
growing population, while providing concrete solutions to help limit
the effects of climate change and supplying its clients with an
energy mix featuring a progressively decreasing carbon intensity.

In addition to safety, the values of respect, responsibility and
exemplary conduct underpin TOTAL’s Code of Conduct and
accompany priority business principles in the realms of
safety/security/health/environment, integrity (preventing corruption,
fraud and anti-competitive practices) and human rights. It is
through strict adherence to these values and principles that TOTAL
intends to build strong and sustainable growth for the Group and its
stakeholders and deliver on its commitment to better energy.

1.3. Group organization

Business overview
History and strategy of TOTAL

In order to implement TOTAL's strategy and in line with the “One
Total” company project, a new organization, fully effective since
January 1, 2017, was put in place and is structured around four
business segments following the creation of the Gas,
Renewables & Power (GRP) segment, alongside the existing
Exploration & Production, Refining & Chemicals and

Marketing & Services segments.

The GRP segment spearheads TOTAL's ambitions in low-carbon
businesses by expanding in downstream gas and renewable
energies as well as in energy efficiency businesses. This segment
brings together the Gas and New Energies divisions (excluding
biotechnologies) and a new Innovation & Energy efficiency division.
Concerning bioenergies, a new Biofuels division now regroups
within the Refining & Chemicals segment all these activities.

In order to improve efficiency, reduce costs and create value within
the Group, the new branch Total Global Services (TGS) pools

the various segments’ support services (Accounting, Purchasing,
Information Systems, Training, Human Resources Administration
and Facilities Management). The entities making up TGS operate as

service companies for internal clients across all four business
segments and the corporate Holding level.

Finally, the diverse Corporate entities were regrouped in two
divisions.

The new People & Social Responsibility division consists of: the
Human Resources division, including Senior Executive
Management; the Health, Safety and Environment division, which
combines HSE departments across the different segments to
establish a strong, unified environmental and safety model; the
Security division; and the new Civil Society Engagement division.

The new Strategy-Innovation division is made of: a new Strategy &
Climate division, responsible notably for ensuring that TOTAL's strategy
incorporates climate issues; the Public Affairs division; the Audit
division; the Research & Development division (which replaces

the Scientific Development Department and now coordinates

all of the Group’s R&D activities and notably transversal programs
such as on carbon capture, use and storage of CO,); the Chief
Digital Officer; and the Senior Vice President, Technology Experts.

2. Business overview for fiscal year 2016

2.1. Upstream segment

TOTAL's Upstream segment includes the activities of Exploration &
Production and Gas. The Group has exploration and production
activities in more than 50 countries and produces oil and gas in
approximately 30 countries. The Gas division conducts downstream
activities related to natural gas, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)

and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), as well as power generation
and trading.

Upstream adjusted net operating income was $3,633 million for the full-year 2016, compared to $4,774 million in 2015, a decrease of 24%,
mainly due the impact of lower hydrocarbon prices which was partially offset by the increase in production combined with the decrease in
operating costs as well as the lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for the Upstream was 26.6% in 2016 compared to 45.5% in 2015.

Technical costs" for consolidated affiliates, calculated in accordance with ASC 932"!, were reduced to 20.4 $/boe in 2016 compared to

Business overview
Upstream segment

2.1.1. Exploration & Production

Exploration & Production (E&P)’'s mission is to discover and develop
cil and gas fields in order to meet growing energy demand. Safety
is a core value for that mission.

In an environment marked by the strong volatility of hydrocarbon
prices, E&P's strategy is to develop an oil and gas production model
that is resilient (.e., able to withstand a long period of low oil and
gas prices), profitable and sustainable.

This strategy is based on three main levers:

— increase profitability: E&P strives to maximize the value of its
assets through operational excellence and to ensure strict
investment discipline by being selective in the sanctioning of new
projects. In addition, E&P continues to restructure or sell the least
performing assets in its portfolio;

develop operational excellence: in order to ensure its resilience,
E&P continues to reduce costs, improve the efficiency of its
installations and start up projects on time and within budget. E&P
also seeks to minimize the environmental impact of its activities; and
renew reserves, through exploration as well as accessing already
discovered resources, building on E&P’s competitive advantages
in terms of geographical spread and technical skills.

E&P is exiting a heavy investments phase, which peaked in 2013
and which is expected to enable production to increase 5% on
average per year over the period of 2014-2020. That growth is
supported, on the one hand, by the start-up of 12 major projects in
2017 and 2018 and, on the other hand, by the improvement of the
facilities’ operational efficiency. In 2016, 5 projects were started up,
contributing to production growth of 4.5% compared to 2015.

2.1.1.1. Exploration and development

TOTAL evaluates exploration opportunities based on a variety
of geological, technical, political, economic (including tax and
contractual terms) environmental and societal factors.

The exploration strategy deployed since 2015 aims to prioritize
the most promising drill targets with a view to creating value and
resources. The Group plans balanced exploration investments:

- 50% for core and emerging basins, where the presence of
hydrocarbons is already proven;

- 25% for near-field exploration around producing assets; and

- 25% for high-potential frontier basins.

In 2015, a new organization for the Group's exploration activities,
adapted to the new strategy, was implemented with a new senior
exploration management team. The organizational changes,
focused notably on strengthening regional basin mastery and
technical excellence, were finalized in 2016 with the transfer of
Asia-Pacific and Americas regional hubs to Singapore and
Houston, respectively.

In 2016, exploration expenditure from all Exploration & Production
subsidiaries was $1.4 billion, mainly in the United States, Norway,
Papua New Guinea, Brazil, Iraq, Bulgaria, Myanmar and the United
Kingdom, compared to $1.9 billion in 2015 and $2.6 billion in 2014.
The 2017 exploration budget is $1.25 billion.

Organic investments" from all Exploration & Production subsidiaries
were $14.5 billion® in 2016, compared to $20.5 billion in 2015 and
$23 billion in 2014, and were mainly in Angola, the Republic of the
Congo, Nigeria, Norway, Canada, Australia, Kazakhstan, the United
Kingdom, Russia, the United States, Abu Dhabi, Indonesia and Brazil.

2.1.1.2. Reserves

The definitions used for proved, proved developed and proved
undeveloped oil and gas reserves are in accordance with the United
States Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 4-10 of
Regulation S-X as amended by the SEC Modernization of Oil and
Gas Reporting release issued on December 31, 2008. Proved
reserves are estimated using geological and engineering data to
determine with reasonable certainty whether the crude oil or natural
gas in known reservoirs is recoverable under existing regulatory,
economic and operating conditions.

TOTAL's oil and gas reserves are consolidated annually, taking into
account, among other factors, levels of production, field reassessments,
additional reserves from discoveries and acquisitions, disposal of
reserves and other economic factors.

Unless otherwise indicated, any reference to TOTAL's proved reserves,
proved developed reserves, proved undeveloped reserves and
production reflects the Group's entire share of such reserves or
such production. TOTAL's worldwide proved reserves include the
proved reserves of its consolidated subsidiaries as well as its
proportionate share of the proved reserves of equity affiliates. The
reserves estimation process involves making subjective judgments.
Consequently, estimates of reserves are not exact measurements
and are subject to revision under well-established control procedures.

The reserves booking process requires, among other things:

— that internal peer review of technical evaluations are carried out
to ensure that the SEC definitions and guidance are followed; and

- that management makes significant funding commitments
towards the development of the reserves prior to booking.

For further information concerning the reserves and their evaluation
process, see points 1 and 2 of chapter 11.

Proved reserves for 2016, 2015 and 2014

In accordance with the amended Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X,
proved reserves at December 31 are calculated using a 12-month
average price determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of
the first-day-of-the-month price for each month of the relevant year
unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding
escalations based upon future conditions. The average reference
prices for Brent crude for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were, respectively,
42.82 $/b, 54.17 $/b and 101.27 $/b.

As of December 31, 2016, TOTAL'’s combined proved reserves of oil
and gas were 11,518 Mboe (58% of which were proved developed
reserves). Liquids (crude oil, condensates, natural gas liquids and
bitumen) represented approximately 47% of these reserves and
natural gas 53%. These reserves were located in Europe (mainly in
Norway and the United Kingdom), Africa (mainly in Angola, Gabon,
Nigeria and the Republic of the Congo), the Americas (mainly in
Canada, Argentina, the United States and Venezuela), the Middle
East (mainly in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen), and
Asia-Pacific (mainly in Australia) and in Kazakhstan and Russia.

(1) For Exploration & Production, organic investments include exploration investments, net development investments and net financial investments.

(2) Excluding the Group's Gas activities

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016


--- Page 6 ---

At a constant oil price (54.17 $/b) the proved reserves were 11,905
Mboe. The difference between the proved reserves based on SEC
rules and the proved reserves based on a constant price is mainly
due to the debooking of proved undeveloped reserves of Canadian
oil sands on the Surmont permit.

Discoveries of new fields and extensions of existing fields added
2,172 Mboe to the Upstream segment's proved reserves during
the 3-year period ended December 31, 2016 (before deducting
production and sales of reserves in place and adding any acquisitions
of reserves in place during this period). The net level of reserve
revisions during this 3-year period is +505 Mboe, which was mainly
due to the overall positive revisions in field behaviors and to the
positive impact of the decrease in hydrocarbon prices in 2015

and 2016 that led to a reserves increase on fields with production
sharing or service contracts and on Canadian bitumen fields (royalty
effect), which was partially offset by the reserves decrease resulting
from the suspension or cancellation due to economic reasons of
capital expenditures associated with, or from shorter producing life
of, certain producing fields.

The 2016 proved reserve replacement rate”), based on SEC rules
(based on Brent at 42.82 $/b in 2016), was 93% in 2016 and 100%
over three years. At a constant price (64.17 $/b in 2015), the proved
reserve replacement rate was 136% in 2016.

As of December 31, 2015, TOTAL'’s combined proved reserves of oil
and gas were 11,580 Mboe (53% of which were proved developed
reserves) compared to 11, 523 Mboe (50% of which were proved
developed reserves) as of December 31, 2014. Liquids (crude oil,
condensates, natural gas liquids and bitumen) at year-end 2015
represented approximately 48% of these reserves and natural gas
the remaining 52% and, at year-end 2014, approximately 46% of
these reserves and natural gas the remaining 54%.

Sensitivity to oil and gas prices

Changes in the price used as a reference for the proved reserves
estimation result in non-proportionate inverse changes in proved
reserves associated with production sharing and risked service
contracts (which together represent approximately 19% of TOTAL’s
reserves as of December 31, 2016). Under such contracts, TOTAL
is entitled to a portion of the production, the sale of which is meant
to cover expenses incurred by the Group. As oil prices decrease,
more barrels are necessary to cover the same amount of expenses.
Moreover, the number of barrels recoverable under these contracts
may vary according to criteria such as cumulative production, the
rate of return on investment or the income-cumulative expenses
ratio. This increase is partly offset by a reduction of the duration
over which fields can be produced economically. However, the
decrease in reserves due to this reduction is generally less than the
increase in reserves under production sharing or risked service
contracts due to such lower prices. As a result, lower prices usually
lead to an increase in TOTAL’ reserves. In Canada, a decrease in
the reference price per barrel used as a reference for estimating
proved reserves leads to a decrease in the volume of royalties and,
therefore, an increase of the proved reserves, and vice versa.

Lastly, for any type of contract, a significant decrease in the
reference price of petroleum products that negatively impacts
projects profitability may lead to a reduction of proved reserves.

Business overview
Upstream segment

2.1.1.3. Production

The average daily production of liquids and natural gas was
2,452 kboe/d in 2016 compared to 2,347 kboe/d in 2015 and
2,146 kboe/d in 2014. Liquids represented approximately 52%
and natural gas approximately 48% of TOTAL's overall production
in 2016.

The tables on the following pages set forth TOTAL's annual and
average daily production of liquids and natural gas by geographic
area and for each of the last three fiscal years.

Consistent with industry practice, TOTAL often holds a percentage
interest in its fields rather than a 100% interest, with the balance
being held by joint venture partners (which may include other
international oil companies, state-owned oil companies or government
entities). The Group's entities may frequently act as operator (the
party responsible for technical production) on acreage in which it
holds an interest. Refer to the table “Presentation of production
activities by region” on the following pages for a presentation of the
Group's producing assets.

As in 2015 and 2014, substantially all of the liquids production from
TOTAL's Upstream segment in 2016 was marketed by the Trading &
Shipping division of TOTAL's Refining & Chemicals segment (refer to
table “Trading’s crude oil sales and supply and petroleum products
sales” in point 2.2.2.1 of this chapter).

2.1.1.4. Delivery commitments

The majority of TOTAL's natural gas production is sold under long-
term contracts. However, its North American production, and part
of its production from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and
Norway, is sold on the spot market. The long-term contracts under
which TOTAL sells its natural gas usually provide for a price related
to, among other factors, average crude oil and other petroleum
product prices, as well as, in some cases, a cost-of-living index.
Though the price of natural gas tends to fluctuate in line with crude
cil prices, a slight delay may occur before changes in crude oil
prices are reflected in long-term natural gas prices.

Some of TOTAL's long-term contracts, notably in Bolivia, Indonesia,
Nigeria, Norway, Thailand and Qatar, specify the delivery of quantities
of natural gas that may or may not be fixed and determinable.
Such delivery commitments vary substantially, both in duration

and scope, from contract to contract throughout the world.

For example, in some cases, contracts require delivery of natural
gas on an as-needed basis, and, in other cases, contracts call for
the delivery of varied amounts of natural gas over different periods
of time. Nevertheless, TOTAL estimates the fixed and determinable
quantity of gas to be delivered over the period 2017-2019 to be
4,734 Bcf. The Group expects to satisfy most of these obligations
through the production of its proved reserves of natural gas, with,

if needed, additional sourcing from spot market purchases

(refer to points 1 and 2 of chapter 11).

2.1.1.5. Contractual framework of activities

Licenses, permits and contracts governing the Group's ownership
of oil and gas interests have terms that vary from country to country
and are generally granted by or entered into with a government
entity or a state-owned company and are sometimes entered into
with private owners. These agreements usually take the form of
concessions or production sharing contracts.

Business overview
Upstream segment

In the framework of oil concession agreements, the oil company
owns the assets and the facilities and is entitled to the entire
production. In exchange, the operating risks, costs and investments
are the oil company’s responsibility and it agrees to remit to the
relevant host country, usually the owner of the subsoil resources, a
production-based royalty, income tax, and possibly other taxes that
may apply under local tax legislation.

The production sharing contract (“PSC”) involves a more complex
legal framework than the concession agreement: it defines the
terms and conditions of production sharing and sets the rules
governing the cooperation between the company or consortium in
possession of the license and the host country, which is generally
represented by a state-owned company. The latter can thus be
involved in operating decisions, cost accounting and production
allocation. The consortium agrees to undertake and finance all
exploration, development and production activities at its own risk.
In exchange, it is entitled to a portion of the production, known as
“cost oil”, the sale of which is intended to cover its incurred
expenses (capital and operating costs). The balance of production,
known as “profit oil”, is then shared in varying proportions, between
the company or consortium, on the one hand, and the host country
or state-owned company, on the other hand.

Today, concession agreements and PSCs can coexist, sometimes
in the same country or even on the same block. Even though there
are other contractual models, TOTAL's license portfolio is
comprised mainly of concession agreements.

On most licenses, the partners and authorities of the host country,
often assisted by international accounting firms, perform joint
venture and PSC cost audits and ensure the observance of
contractual obligations.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016

In some countries, TOTAL has also signed contracts called “risked
service contracts”, which are similar to PSCs. However, the profit oil
is replaced by a defined cash monetary remuneration, agreed by
contract, which depends notably on field performance parameters
such as the amount of barrels produced.

Oil and gas exploration and production activities are subject to
authorization granted by public authorities (licenses), which are
granted for specific and limited periods of time and include an
obligation to relinquish a large portion, or the entire portion in case
of failure, of the area covered by the license at the end of the
exploration period.

TOTAL pays taxes on income generated from its oil and gas
production and sales activities under its concessions, PSCs and
risked service contracts, as provided for by local regulations.

In addition, depending on the country, TOTAL's production and
sales activities may be subject to a number of other taxes, fees and
withholdings, including special petroleum taxes and fees. The taxes
imposed on oil and gas production and sales activities are generally
substantially higher than those imposed on other industrial or
commercial businesses.

2.1.1.8. Main activities by geographical zone

The information below describes the Group's main exploration and
production activities presented by geographical zones according to the
internal business units" of the Group, without detailing all of the assets
held by TOTAL. In each area, the countries are presented in decreasing
order of production. The capacities referred to herein are expressed on
a 100% basis, regardless of the Group's stake in the asset.

Europe and Central Asia

In 2016, TOTAL’s production in the zone of Europe and Central
Asia was 757 kboe/d, representing 31% of the Group’s total
production, compared to 664 kboe/d in 2015 and 613 kboe/d
in 2014. The two main producing countries in this zone in 2016
were Russia and Norway.

In Russia, where the largest percentage of TOTAL's proved reserves
are located (nearly 21% as of December 31, 2016), the Group's
production was 335 kboe/d in 2016, compared to 290 kboe/d in
2015 and 235 kboe/d in 2014. This production comes from the
Kharyaga and Termokarstovoye fields and TOTAL's stake in PAO
Novatek"!. Since 2015, Russia has been the leading contributor to
the Group's production.

In addition to the shareholding in Novatek, TOTAL currently
participates in the Yamal LNG and Termokarstovoye projects with
Novatek via a direct stake:

- Yamal LNG: in 2013, the company OAO Yamal LNG! launched
this project aimed at developing the onshore field of South
Tambey (gas and condensates) located on the Yamal peninsula,
and at building a three-train gas liquefaction plant with total LNG
capacity of 16.5 Mt/y. The Yamal LNG project's financing was
finalized in 2016 in compliance with applicable regulations.

At year-end 2016, 75% of the project was completed and over
96% of the LNG volumes have been sold through long-term sale
agreements. Production is expected to start by year-end 2017.
Termokarstovoye (an onshore gas and condensates field, located
in the Yamalo-Nenets region): the development and production
license of Termokarstovoye field is held by ZAO Terneftegas, a
joint venture between Novatek (51%) and TOTAL (49%). The field
came into production in 2015 (capacity of 65 kboe/d).

In August 2016, TOTAL sold a 20% interest in the Kharyaga field
(thus reducing its stake to 20%) and transferred operatorship of the
field to the purchaser, Zarubezhneft.

Since 2014, certain Russian persons and entities, including various
entities operating in the energy sector, are subject to international
economic sanctions adopted, in particular, by the United States,
the European Union. TOTAL complies with sanctions applicable to
its activities. For further information, refer to point 1.9 of chapter 4
(Risk factors).

In Norway, TOTAL has equity stakes in 93 production licenses on
the Norwegian maritime continental shelf, 35 of which it operates.
The Group's production in 2016 was 235 kboe/d compared to
239 kboe/d in 2015 and 242 kboe/d in 2014.

— Inthe Greater Ekofisk area, the Group holds a 39.9% stake in the
Ekofisk and Eldfisk fields. Production at Ekofisk South started in
2013 and at Eldfisk Il in 2015 (capacity of 70 kboe/d each).

Business overview
Upstream segment

— In the Sleipner area, the development of the Gina Krog field located
in the north of Sleipner and approved in 2013 is underway.

In December 2016, the Group sold a stake of 15% in this field,
reducing its participation from 30% to 15%.

In the Greater Hild area, the development of the Martin Linge field
(51%, operator, estimated capacity 80 kboe/d) is underway.

In the Barents Sea, the Group holds an 18.4% stake in the gas
liquefaction plant of Snohvit (capacity of 4.2 Mt/y). This plant is
supplied with production from the Snahvit and Albatross gas fields.

In the United Kingdom, the Group's production was 158 kboe/d
in 2016 compared to 107 kboe/d in 2015 and 89 kboe/d in 2014.
More than 90% of this production comes from operated fields in
the three main areas described below.

In the Alwyn/Dunbar area (100%) in the Northern North Sea,
production from the Alwyn and Dunbar fields represents 25%
and 18% of production, respectively, of this area. The rest of the
production comes from satellites, which are:

1) linked to Alwyn by subsea tieback: the Forvie gas and
condensates field joined by the Jura and Islay fields and the
Nuggets gas field network; and

2) linked to Dunbar: the Ellon (oil and gas) and the Grant (gas and
condensates) fields.

On the Dunbar field (100%), the additional development phase

(Dunbar phase IV) was stopped in 2016 for technical and

economic reasons.

In the Elgin/Franklin area in the Central Graben, TOTAL holds

stakes in the Elgin-Franklin and West Franklin fields (46.17%,

operator). Concerning the Elgin redevelopment project (drilling of

five wells), two wells were drilled in 2016. The West Franklin

Phase II project, comprising the addition of two platforms and

the drilling of three wells, was completed in 2016 when the last

well was drilled.

In the West of Shetland area, the Laggan and Tormore fields

(60%, operator) came into production in 2016. Production is

expected to start on the Edradour and Glenlivet fields (60%,

operator) in 2017 (total production capacity of 90 kboe/d).

TOTAL also operates the P967 license, including the Tobermory

gas discovery (30%).

Impairments on gas assets in the United Kingdom were recognized
in the 2015 and 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, TOTAL holds five shale gas exploration and production
licenses (PEDL 139 and 140, 40%; PEDL 273, 305 and 316, 50%)
located in the Gainsborough Trough basin (East Midlands region).

The sale of interests held by Total E&P UK in transport pipelines
(FUKA and SIRGE) and the St. Fergus terminal was finalized in
March 2016.

In the Netherlands, the Group's production was 25 kboe/d in 2016
compared to 28 kboe/d in 2015 and 31 kboe/d in 2014. This decrease
was due to natural field decline. TOTAL holds interests in 24 offshore
production licenses, including 20 that it operates, and an offshore
exploration license (K1c, 30%).

(1) The geographical zones are as folows: Europe and Central Asia; Afica (excluding North Atrica); Middle East and North AVtica; Americas; and Asia-Pacific. The information presented relating to 2015

and 2014 production has been restated accordingly

(2) A Russian company listed on stock exchanges in the Moscow and London stock exchanges and in which the Group held an interest of 18.9% as of December 31, 2016.

Business overview
Upstream segment

In Kazakhstan, TOTAL holds a stake in the North Caspian license
(16.81%), which covers the Kashagan field. Production of the first
phase of the Kashagan field and the associated processing plant
(capacity of 370 kb/d) restarted in October 2016 after pipeline
problems had taken it off stream for three years. Replacement of
the pipelines by the operator was completed in the summer of 2016.
The Group's production was 4 kboe/d in 2016 and is expected to
gradually increase between now and the end of 2017. In July 2016,
TOTAL withdrew from the Nurmunai North and South onshore
exploration licenses (51.1%, operator) located in the southwest of
the country, due to negative results from the two exploration wells
drilled in 2015.

In Italy, TOTAL holds stakes in the Tempa Rossa field (60%, operator),
located on the Gorgoglione concession (Basilicate region), and
three exploration licenses. The Tempa Rossa development project
is underway, with production expected to start at the end of 2017.

In Azerbaijan, TOTAL signed an agreement in November 2016
establishing the contractual and commercial conditions for a first
phase of production of the Absheron gas and condensate field
located in the Caspian Sea and discovered by TOTAL in 2011
(40%, operator). The agreement enabled to define a cost-competitive
development scheme by tying the field to existing infrastructure in
order to deliver gas at a competitive price. The capacity production
from this high pressure field is expected to be approximately 35 kboe/d.
The produced gas will supply Azerbaijan's domestic market.

In France, the Group's production ended in 2014 with the sale of
the Lacq concessions to Geopetrol. Total E&P France remains the
owner of parts of the Lacq industrial site, located in the southwest
of France, and is carrying out decommissioning, dismantling and
site rehabilitation activities.

In Bulgaria, where TOTAL has been present since 2012, the Group
drilled a deep offshore exploration well in 2016 on the Han Asparuh
block (14,220 km?), 100 km offshore in the Black Sea, which revealed
the presence of oil in this area for the first time.

In Denmark, TOTAL relinquished the two shale gas exploration
licenses (80%, operator) it acquired in 2010, in July 2015 for the
license 2/10 (Nordsjaelland) and in June 2016 for the license 1/10
(Nordjylland).

Rest of the Europe and Central Asia area
TOTAL also holds interests in an exploration license without activity
in Tajikistan.

Africa

In 2016, TOTAL’s production in the zone of Africa (excluding
North Africa) was 634 kboe/d, representing 26% of the Group’s
total production, compared to 639 kboe/d in 2015 and 610 kboe/d
2014. The two main producing countries in this zone in 2016
were Nigeria and Angola.

In Nigeria, the Group's production, primarily offshore, was 243 kboe/d
in 2016, compared to 245 kboe/d in 2015 and 257 kboe/d in 2014.
This drop in production was due mainly to the sale of interests in
certain licenses of the Shell Petroleum Development Company
(SPDC) joint venture as well as to difficult operational security
conditions in the Niger delta that had a negative impact on onshore
production and, in particular, the oil export of the Forcados terminal
operated by Shell.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016

TOTAL operates 5 of the 35 oil mining leases (OML) in which it has
interests and also holds interests in 3 oil prospecting licenses (OPL).

TOTAL has offshore operations (production was 160 kboe/d in
2016) notably on the following leases:

- On OML 139 (18%), the Owowo-3 exploration well, drilled

in 2016, confirmed the discovery of oil made in 2012 and should
enable progress in the preparation of the development plan.
The discovery is located near OML 138 (20%), where three oil
discoveries were made in 2014 and 2015.

OML 130 (24%, operator): the development of the Egina field
(200 kboe/d capacity) launched in 2013 is underway, and
production is expected to start in 2018. The assessment of the
Preowei field is planned in 2017.

On OML 102 (40%, operator), in 2014 TOTAL stopped routine
flaring on the Ofon field (Ofon phase 2 project). The gas
associated with the production of oil is now compressed and
sent onshore to the Nigeria LNG plant. All activities of the Ofon 2
project were completed in 2016 and the drilling of 24 additional
wells, started in 2015, continues.

On OML 99 (40%, operator), studies are ongoing for the
development of the Ikike field.

On OML 118 (12.5%), the Bonga field contributed 19 kboe/d to
the Group's production in 2016. Optimization studies of the
Bonga South West Aparo project (10% unitized) are ongoing
with an investment decision target in 2018.

TOTAL has onshore operations (production was 83 kboe/d in 2016),
notably:

— On OML 58 (40%, operator), under its joint venture with Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), a gas production
capacity of 550 Mcf/d was reached and delivery of gas to the
Nigerian domestic market started in 2016.

In relation to the SPDC joint venture (10%), which includes 20 oil
mining leases (of which 17 are located onshore), the 2016
production was 46 kboe/d (of which 43 kboe/d was onshore).
TOTAL sold its 10% interest in OML 24 (in 2014) and OMLs 18
and 29 (in 2015), operated via the SPDC joint venture. In addition,
the sale process of OML 25 is underway.

TOTAL is also developing LNG activities with a 15% stake in the
Nigeria LNG Ltd company, which owns a liquefaction plant with a
22 Mt/year total capacity. Assessments are ongoing for the
installation of an additional capacity of approximately 8.5 Mt/year.

In Angola, where TOTAL is the leading oil operator in the country",
the Group's production was 243 kboe/d in 2016, compared to
248 kboe/d in 2015 and 200 kboe/d in 2014. This production
comes from Blocks 17, 14 and 0, and Angola LNG.

— Deep offshore Block 17 (40%, operator), TOTAL’s main asset in
Angola, is composed of four major producing hubs: Girassol, Dalia,
Pazflor and CLOV. TOTAL continued to invest in brown field
projects in 2016, including in particular Dalia Phase 2A and Girassol
M14, which are expected to start production in 2017. In 2015,
Dalia Phase 1A went into production and the start of multiphase
pumps enabled production to be increased at Girassol. The Zinia
phase 2 project, a satellite development of Pazflor, is moving forward.
On the ultra-deep offshore Block 32 (30%, operator), the Kaombo
project was launched in 2014 to develop the discoveries in the
southeast part of the block via two FPSOs (floating production
storage and offloading facilities) with a capacity of 115 kb/d

each. The drilling campaign of 59 wells began in 2015. In

June 2016, a presidential decree was published providing new
tax conditions for the project. The center and north parts of the
block (outside Kaombo) offer additional exploration potential and
are currently being assessed.

— On Block 14 (20%), production comes from the Tombua-
Landana and Kuito fields as well as the BBLT project, comprising
the Benguela, Belize, Lobito and Tomboco fields.

— Block 14K (36.75%) is the offshore unitization area between
Angola (Block 14) and the Republic of the Congo (Haute Mer
license). The Lianzi field, which is connected to the existing BBLT
platform (Block 14), started production in 2015. TOTAL's interest
in the unitized zone is held 10% through Angola Block 14 BV and
26.75% through Total E&P Congo.

- On Block 0 (10%), the second phase of the Mafumeira field
development project started production in March 2017.

TOTAL is also developing its LNG activities through the Angola LNG
project (13.6%), which includes a gas liquefaction plant near Soyo
supplied by gas associated with production from Blocks 0, 14, 15,
17 and 18. LNG production started in 2013, but various technical
incidents required an extended shutdown of the plant. LNG
production restarted in May 2016. Taking into account the revised
gas price assumptions, an impairment on Angola LNG was
recognized in the 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the Bas-Congo basin, TOTAL is also the operator of exploration
Block 17/06 (30%).

In the deep offshore Kwanza basin, TOTAL is the operator of
Blocks 25 (35%) and 40 (40%).The Block 39 license (7.5%) expired
at the end of December 2016.

In the Republic of the Congo, the Group's production, through its
subsidiary Total E&P Congo”), was 90 kboe/d in 2016, compared
to 87 kboe/d in 2015 and 95 kboe/d in 2014.

— On the offshore field Moho Bilondo (53.5%, operator), the Phase
1b project (estimated capacity of 40 kboe/d) started production
in 2015. The Moho Nord project (estimated capacity of 100 kboe/d)
started production in March 2017.

— Block 14K (36.75%) corresponds to the offshore unitization area
between the Republic of the Congo (Haute Mer license) and
Angola (Block 14 located in Angola). The Lianzi field started
production in 2015. TOTAL's interests in the unitization area are
held 26.75% by Total E&P Congo and 10% by Angola Block 14 BV.

— Total E&P Congo is operator of Djéno (63%) the sole oil terminal
in the country.

- On December 31, 2016, Total E&P Congo returned its interests
in the Tchibouela, Tchendo, Tchibeli and Litanzi fields (65%) to
the Republic of the Congo, as the licenses have expired.

In Gabon, the Group's production was 58 kboe/d in 2016 compared
to 59 kboe/d in 2015 and 58 kboe/d in 2014. The Group's activities
in Gabon are primarily carried out by Total Gabon"). TOTAL wholly
owns and operates the Anguille and Torpille sector offshore fields,
the Mandji Island sector onshore fields and the Cap Lopez oil
terminal. TOTAL is also the operator of the Baudroie-Mérou
offshore fields (50%) and the Diaba deep offshore license (42.5%),
where the Diaman gas discovery was made in 2013. In February
2017, TOTAL signed an agreement for the sale of stakes and the

subject to approval by the authorities.

In Uganda, a growth area for the Group TOTAL has been present
in the upstream since 2012, and has a 33.33% stake in the licenses
EA-1, EA-1A (Lyec), EA-2 (Bulisa and Kaiso Tonya area) and EA-3
(Kingfisher) all located in the Lake Albert region. TOTAL is the
operator of licenses EA-1 and EA-1A. In January 2017, TOTAL
signed an agreement to acquire 21.57% of the 33.33% interest
held by Tullow in the licenses EA-1, EA-1A, EA-2 and EA-3. TOTAL
will take over operatorship from Tullow of license EA-2, enabling
significant efficiency gains and synergies. This agreement remains
subject to the approvals of the Ugandan authorities and the pre-
emption rights of the partners.

In April 2016, the Government of Uganda decided to export the
Lake Albert oil through a pipeline (EACOP) via Tanzania to the port
of Tanga. In August 2016, the production licenses for EA-1 and
EA-2 were formally granted. The partners of the Uganda Joint
Venture have launched the FEED (Front End Engineering and
Design) phase for the Upstream and the EACOP pipeline.

Rest of the zone of Africa

TOTAL also holds interests in exploration licenses in South Africa,
Céte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Mauritania, Mozambique and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, and is negotiating with the authorities with a
view to resuming exploration activities in the Republic of South
Sudan. In July 2016, TOTAL withdrew from the Bemolanga license
in Madagascar.

Middle East and North Africa

In 2016, TOTAL’s production in the zone of the Middle East and
North Africa was 517 kboe/d, representing 21% of the Group’s
total production, compared to 531 kboe/d in 2015 and 438 kboe/d
in 2014. The two main producing countries in this zone in 2016
were the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.

In the United Arab Emirates, the Group's production was 291 kboe/d
in 2016 compared to 287 kboe/d in 2015 and 127 kboe/d in 2014.
The Group holds, since January 1, 2015, a 10% stake in the Abu
Dhabi Company for Onshore Petroleum Operations Ltd. (ADCO)
concession for a period of 40 years, which follows a previous onshore
concession. This concession covers the 15 main onshore fields of
Abu Dhabi and represents more than half of the Emirate’s production.

TOTAL holds a 75% stake (operator) in the Abu Al Bukhoosh field
and a 13.3% stake in the Abu Dhabi Marine (ADMA) concession,
which operates two of the main offshore fields in Abu Dhabi (Umm
Shaif and Lower Zakum). TOTAL also holds a 15% stake in Abu
Dhabi Gas Industries (GASCO), which produces NGL and
condensates from the associated gas produced by ADCO. In addition,
TOTAL holds 5% of the Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company
(ADGAS), which processes the associated gas produced by ADMA
in order to produce LNG, NGL and condensates, and 5% of
National Gas Shipping Company (NGSCO), which owns eight LNG
tankers and exports the LNG produced by ADGAS.

TOTAL holds a 24.5% stake in Dolphin Energy Ltd. in partnership
with Mubadala, a company owned by the government of Abu Dhabi,

0.3 Bef/d of gas coming from Qatar to be sold domestically.

The Group also owns 33.33% of Ruwais Fertilizer Industries
(FERTIL), which produces urea (production capacity of 2 Mt/year).

In Qatar, the Group's production was 134 kboe/d in 2016 and
in 2015, compared to 132 kboe/d in 2014.

In June 2016, TOTAL signed an agreement granting it a 30% stake
in the Al-Shaheen offshore oil field concession for a period of 25
years beginning July 14, 2017. The Al-Shaheen field has been
producing since 1994 and lies offshore 80 km north of Ras Laffan.
Production, which represents approximately half of Qatar's oil
production", is provided by 30 platforms and 300 wells. As of

July 2017, the Al-Shaheen field will be operated by a new operating
company, North Oil Company, held by TOTAL (30%) and Qatar
Petroleum (70%).

TOTAL operates the Al Khalij field (40%, operator) and participates
in the production, processing and exporting of gas from the North
Field through its stakes in the Qatargas 1 and Qatargas 2 LNG
plants and in Dolphin Energy:

— Qatargas 1: TOTAL holds a 20% stake in the upstream block of
Qatargas 1 supplying the three LNG trains of Qatargas 1
(capacity of 10 Mt/y), in which the Group has a 10% interest.

— Qatargas 2: the Group holds a 16.7% stake in train 5, which has

an LNG production capacity of 8 Mt/y. TOTAL offtakes part of the

LNG produced under the 2006 contracts that provide for the

purchase of 5.2 Mt/y of LNG by the Group.

Dolphin Energy (24.5%): the contract signed in 2001 with Qatar

Petroleum provides for the production and sale of gas and liquids

from the Dolphin block located on the North Field. Raw gas is

processed at the Dolphin plant in Ras Laffan, where the liquids
are extracted. This gas is then routed to the United Arab

Emirates by a 360 km gas pipeline in order to be sold (contract

of 2 Bef/d over a 25-year period).

In Oman, the Group's production was 37 kboe/d in 2016,
compared to 36 kboe/d in 2015 and 2014. TOTAL participates in
the production of oil principally in Block 6 (4%), but also in Block
53 (2%). The Group also produces LNG through its investments in
the Oman LNG (5.54%)/Qalhat LNG (2.04%) liquefaction
complex, with an overall capacity of 10.5 Mt/y.

In Algeria, TOTAL'’s production was 23 kboe/d in 2016 compared
to 25 kboe/d in 2015 and 20 kboe/d in 2014. All of the Group's
production in Algeria comes from the Tin Fouyé Tabankort (TFT)
field (35%). In addition, the development of the Timimoun gas field
(37.75%) continued in 2016 with engineering activities, activities
related to the construction of the plant and drilling.

In Iraq, the Group's production was 18 kboe/d in 2016, stable
compared to 2015, and 12 kboe/d in 2014. TOTAL holds a 22.5%
stake in the development and production contract for the Halfaya
field, located in Missan province. In 2016, the development of

phase 3 of the project (to increase production to 400 kb/d) was the
subject of additional studies. In Iraqi Kurdistan, TOTAL relinquished
four exploration blocks that expired in 2016. An impairment on the

assets in Iraqi Kurdistan was recognized in the 2016 Consolidated

Financial Statements.

In Libya, where security conditions remain unstable, the Group's
production was 14 kboe/d in 2016 and in 2015, compared to

27 kboe/d in 2014. This production comes from blocks located on
offshore areas 15, 16 and 32 (Al Jurf, 75%“), which have not been
affected by security issues. Since the fourth quarter of 2014,
production as well as exploration activities have been stopped

on Mabruk — onshore areas 70 and 87 (75%) — and on the fields
of El Sharara — onshore area 130 and 131 (24%). The production
on the fields of El Sharara — onshore area 129 and 130 (30% “*!) —
resumed at the end of December 2016. Taking into account the
uncertain context in Libya, an impairment on the onshore assets
was recognized in the 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements.

In Yemen, the Group had no production in 2016, compared to

17 kboe/d in 2015 and 84 kboe/d in 2014. Due to the security
conditions in the vicinity of Balhaf, Yemen LNG, in which the Group
holds a stake of 39.62%, stopped its commercial production and
export of LNG in April 2015, when Yemen LNG declared force majeure
to its various stakeholders. The plant is in a preservation mode.

TOTAL is a partner in Block 5 (Marib basin, Jannah license, 15%)
and holds various stakes in four onshore exploration licenses.

In Iran, TOTAL signed a heads of agreement in November 2016

to develop phase 11 of the giant South Pars gas field (expected
production capacity of 370 kboe/d), pursuant to which TOTAL is
expected to operate South Pars 11 with a 50.1% interest alongside
Petropars (19.9%), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National
Iranian Oil Company (“NIOC"), and the Chinese state-owned
company CNPC (30%). The produced gas is expected to supply
the Iranian domestic market. Two development phases are
planned: the first for the construction of two platforms, 30 wells
and two connecting lines to existing onshore treatment facilities,
and the second for the installation of offshore compression facilities.
This project fits with TOTAL's strategy of expanding its presence in
the Middle East and growing its gas portfolio by adding a low unit
cost, long plateau gas asset. For further information on the
international sanctions concerning Iran, refer to point 1.9

of chapter 4 (Risk factors).

In Syria, TOTAL has had no production and no activity since
December 2011. The Group has a 100% stake in the Deir Ez Zor
license, which was operated by the joint venture company DEZPC, in
which TOTAL and the state-owned company SPC each have a 50%
share. Additionally, TOTAL is holder of the Tabiyeh contract which came
into effect in 2009. For further information on the international sanctions

Americas

In 2016, TOTAL’s production in the zone of the Americas was
279 kboe/d, representing 11% of the Group's total production,
compared to 255 kboe/d in 2015 and 247 kboe/d in 2014.

The two main producing countries in this zone in 2016 were
the United States and Argentina.

In the United States, the Group's production was 86 kboe/d in
2016, compared to 89 kboe/d in 2015 and 78 kboe/d in 2014.

Following the exercise of its preemption right, TOTAL acquired in
November 2016 the 75% stake held by Chesapeake in the Barnett
shale gas assets area located in North Texas, in which the Group
had already a 25% interest since 2009. This transaction provides
for the restructuring of the gas gathering and transportation contracts
with respect to the acquired stake. The planned work relates to well
intervention and well restarts. No wells were drilled in 2016 compared
to 4 in 2015 and 40 in 2014.

TOTAL also has a 25% stake in a joint venture operated by Chesapeake
in the Utica basin (on an acreage mainly located in Ohio) that produces
shale gas. TOTAL was not involved in the drilling of any wells in
2016 compared to 8 in 2015 and approximately 170 in 2014.

Following successive decreases in gas prices in the United States,
impairments on shale gas assets were recognized in the 2014 and
2015 Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the Gulf of Mexico, TOTAL holds interests in the deep offshore
fields Tahiti (17%) and Chinook (33.33%). In Tahiti, the Tahiti Vertical
Expansion (TVEX) project was launched in 2016 in order to extend
the production level of the field.

The TOTAL (40%) — Cobalt (60%, operator) alliance, formed in 2009
for exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, continued its work to delineate
the North Platte discovery.

In Argentina, TOTAL operated approximately 30%" of the country’s
gas production in 2016. The Group's production was 78 kboe/d in
2016 compared to 72 kboe/d in 2015 and 75 kboe/d in 2014.

In Tierra del Fuego, the Group operates the Carina and Aries
offshore fields (37.5%). The drilling of two additional wells off the
existing platform was completed in 2015. The Vega Pleyade field
(37.5%, operator), where development work was launched in
2013 (with a production capacity of 350 Mcf/d), started
production in February 2016.

In the Neuquén basin, two pilot projects were launched following
positive initial results of the exploration campaign on its mining
licenses in order to assess its gas and shale oil potential: the first
on the Aguada Pichana Block (27.27%, operator), where
production started mid-2015, and the second on the Rincén la
Ceniza (45.00%, operator) and La Escalonada (45.00%,
operator) Blocks, where production started in July 2016.

In Venezuela, the Group's production was 47 kboe/d in 2016
compared to 52 kboe/d in 2015 and 2014. TOTAL has stakes in
PetroCedefio (30.32%) and Yucal Placer (69.50%) as well as the
offshore exploration Block 4 of Plataforma Deltana (49%).

Development of the extra heavy oil field of PetroCede/io continues

water separation and treatment facilities.

In Bolivia, the Group's production, mainly gas, was 34 kboe/d in
2016, compared to 28 kboe/d in 2015 and 30 kboe/d in 2014.
TOTAL is active on seven licenses: three production licenses at San
Alberto (15%), San Antonio (15%) and Block XX Tarija Oeste (41%);
two licenses in development phase, Aquio and lpati (60%),
operator); and two exploration phase licenses, Rio Hondo (50%)
and Azero (50%, operator of the exploration phase).

— The Incahuasi gas field, located in the Aquio and Ipati Blocks,
started production in August 2016. A second development
phase, which would involve the drilling of three additional wells,

is under consideration.

TOTAL holds a 50% stake in the Azero exploration license
located in the Andean foothills, which extends over an area of
more than 7,800 km?. The exploration period began in 2014.

A geophysical data acquisition campaign was started in the fourth
quarter of 2016 and is expected to be followed by the drilling of a
well in 2018.

In Canada, the Group's production was 34 kboe/d in 2016
compared to 14 kboe/d in 2015 and 12 kboe/d in 2014. The Group's
activities were not significantly affected by the wildfires that struck
Alberta in May and June 2016. The Group's production comes
entirely from the Surmont (50%) project developed by SAGD®,
the second phase of which was commissioned in 2015. Following
the ramp-up of this phase in 2016 and 2017, the project is expected
to produce a total of approximately 150 kb/d (75 kb/d Group share).

Construction of the Fort Hills oil sands mining project was more
than 80% complete at year-end 2016, and the operator expects
to start production at the end of 2017.

As a result of a full comparative analysis of its global asset portfolio
in the context of lower oil prices, the Group decided in 2015 to
decrease its exposure to Canadian oil sands and reduced its stake
in Fort Hills from 39.2% to 29.2%. An impairment on the part

of the asset sold was recognized in the 2015 Consolidated
Financial Statements.

On the Joslyn (38.25%, operator) and Northern Lights (50% operator)
licenses, the projects were suspended in 2014 and works have
been strictly limited to legal and contractual obligations, and
maintaining safety.

An impairment on the oil sands assets was recognized
in the 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements.

In Brazil, a growth area for the Group, TOTAL acquired in 2013 a
20% stake in the Libra field, located in the Santos basin.

The Libra field is located in the ultra-deep offshore (2,000 m)
approximately 170 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, and covers
an area of 1,550 km. In 2014, construction started on a 50 kb/d
capacity FPSO for long-term production testing. At year-end 2016,
in addition to the discovery well, eight wells have been drilled in the
field. Development phase 1 (17 wells connected to an FPSO with a
capacity of 150 kb/d) is expected to start in 2017.

In addition, the Group holds 17 exploration licenses located in the
Foz do Amazonas, Barreirinhas, Ceara, Espirito Santo and Pelotas

basins. An initial exploration well is expected to be drilled by year-
end 2017 in the Foz do Amazonas basin.

In February 2017, TOTAL and Petrobras signed definitive contracts
in relation to a package of upstream and downstream gas and
electricity assets in Brazil and other international opportunities
contemplated by their strategic alliance agreed in December 2016.
As part of this strategic alliance, TOTAL will hold a 22.5% interest in
the concession area named lara, located in Block BM-S-11, which
is currently under development, as well as a 35% interest and the
operatorship in the Lapa field concession area, located in Block
BM-S-9. The Lapa field entered into production in December 2016.
Petrobras will have the option of taking a 20% stake in the deep-
water exploration Block 2 (Perdido Belt) recently obtained during
the bid round in Mexico. Finally, technical cooperation between the
two companies will be strongly reinforced, in particular by the joint
assessment of the exploration potential of promising areas in Brazil
and by the development of new technologies, in particular in deep-
water. The deal is subject to regulatory approvals, the potential
exercise of preemptive rights by current partners on the lara
concession and other conditions precedent.

In Mexico, TOTAL was awarded in December 2016 exploration
licenses on three blocks in offshore Mexico, following the country’s
first competitive deep water bid round resulting from the reform of
the energy sector. Located in the Perdido basin, Block 2 (50%,
operator) covers a surface area of 2,977 km? at water depths
ranging from 2,300 m to 3,600 m. Block 1 (33.3%) and Block 3
(33.3%) are located in the Salina basin and cover a surface area of
2,381 km? and 3,287 km2, respectively.

Rest of the zone of the Americas
TOTAL also owns interests in exploration licenses in Aruba,
Colombia, French Guyana and Uruguay.

Asia-Pacific

In 2016, TOTAL’s production in the zone of Asia-Pacific was
265 kboe/d, representing 11% of the Group’s overall production,
compared to 258 kboe/d in 2015 and 238 kboe/d in 2014.

The two main producing countries in this zone in 2016 were
Indonesia and Thailand.

In Indonesia, the Group's production was 140 kboe/d in 2016
compared to 147 kboe/d in 2015 and 130 kboe/d in 2014.

TOTAL's operations in Indonesia are primarily concentrated on the
Mahakam license (50%, operator), which in particular includes the
Peciko and Tunu gas fields. The Group also has a stake in the Sisi-
Nubi gas field (47.9%, operator). The Mahakam license expires in
December 2017. The Indonesian government has decided to
allocate 100% of the participating interest to Pertamina (operator)
from January 1, 2018 onwards, while giving Pertamina the possibility
to farm out some interests to TOTAL and its current partner, INPEX.
The Group delivers most of its natural gas production to the
Bontang LNG plant. These volumes of gas represented more than
80% of the Bontang plant's supply in 2016. To this gas production
was added the operated production of oil and condensates from
the Handil and Bekapai fields.

- On the Mahakam license, the works aimed at maintaining
production on the Tunu, Peciko, South Mahakam, Sisi-Nubi and
Bekapai fields continued.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016

On the Sebuku license (15%), production from the Ruby gas field
is routed by pipeline for processing and separation at the
Senipah terminal (operated by TOTAL).

TOTAL also holds stakes in two exploration blocks: Mentawai
(80%, operator) and Telen (100%).

In addition, the Group holds stakes in blocks with no activity

and for which a relinquishment process is underway: South Mandar
(49.3%), South Sageri (100%), South West Bird’s Head (90%,
operator) and South East Mahakam (50%, operator).

In Thailand, the Group's production was 60 kboe/d in 2016 compared
to 62 kboe/d in 2015 and 60 kboe/d in 2014. This production comes
from the offshore gas and condensate field of Bongkot (33.33%).
PTT (the Thai state-owned company) purchases all of the natural
gas and condensate production. New investments are underway
for maintaining the plateau and responding to gas demand.

In Myanmar, the Group's production was 21 kboe/d in 2016,
compared to 19 kboe/d in 2015 and 17 kboe/d in 2014.

The Yadana field (31.24%, operator), located on the offshore Blocks
M5 and M6, primarily produces gas for delivery to PTT for use in
Thai power plants. The Yadana field also supplies the domestic
market via an offshore pipeline built and operated by MOGE, a
Myanmar state-owned company. The LCP-Badamyar project,
which includes the installation of the Badamyar field compression
and development platform connected to the Yadana facilities, was
launched in 2014. Drilling at Badamyar began in November 2016.

In 2014, TOTAL was awarded the deep offshore Block YWB
(100%, operator) during the offshore round launched by the local
authorities. The PSC was signed in 2015.

In 2015, the Group sold its stake in the offshore Block M11
(47.06%) and entered exploration license A6 (40%) located in the
deep offshore area west of Myanmar. A first well was drilled in 2015
on which a natural gas discovery has been made and which
requires further evaluation work.

In 2016, TOTAL signed farm-in agreements on the deep offshore
licenses MD-02 (40%), MD-04 (40%) and MD-07 (50%).

In Brunei, TOTAL operates the Maharaja Lela Jamalulalam offshore
gas and condensate field on Block B (37.5%). The Group’s
production was 18 kboe/d in 2016 compared to 15 kboe/d in 2015
and 2014. The gas is delivered to the Brunei LNG liquefaction plant.
Discussions are underway regarding the terms of the unitization of
the northern part of the Maharaja Lela Jamalulalam field with the
Malaysian part of the field.

On the Maharaja Lela South project, a first debottlenecking phase
for the production processing plant was completed in 2015,
increasing production capacity by 20% (from 165 Mcf/d to 200
Mcf/d). Offshore, the installation of a third platform was completed
at the end of 2015 and the drilling campaign is ongoing. Three wells
started production in 2016.

Studies are currently being conducted to reassess the potential of
the deep offshore exploration Block CA1 (86.9%, operator), which
includes the Jagus East discovery. A well was drilled in 2015, and
has confirmed the connection of the Jagus East field with the
Gumusut-Kakap reservoirs in Malaysia. Discussions regarding the
terms of the unitization of these two reservoirs are underway. They
aim to ensure unified governance of the fields while setting out the
distribution of costs and production between the parties.

In Australia, where TOTAL has had mining rights since 2005, the
Group's production was 16 kboe/d in 2016, compared to 4 kboe/d
in 2015 and 2014.

— The Ichthys project (30%) involves the development of a gas and
condensate field located in the Browse Basin. This development
will include a floating platform designed for the production,
processing and export of gas, an FPSO (with condensate
processing capacity of 100 kb/d) to stabilize and export the
condensate, an 889 km gas pipeline and an onshore liquefaction
plant (with 8.9 Mt/y LNG and 1.6 Mt/y LPG capacities) at Darwin.
The LNG has already been sold, mainly to Asian buyers, under
long-term contracts. As per the information provided by the
operator, production is expected to start before the end of 2017.

- Gladstone LNG (GLNG) (27.5%) is an integrated gas production,
transportation and liquefaction project with a capacity of 7.8 Mt/y
from the Fairview, Roma, Scotia and Arcadia fields. Train 1
of the plant started production in 2015 and train 2 in May 2016.
An impairment was recognized in the 2015 and 2016 Consolidated
Financial Statements.

In China, where TOTAL has been operating since 2006, the Group's
production was 10 kboe/d in 2016 compared to 11 kboe/d in 2015
and 12 kboe/d in 2014. This production comes from the South
Sulige Block (49%) in the Ordos Basin of Inner Mongolia, where the
drilling of tight gas development wells is ongoing.

Business overview
Upstream segment

In Papua New Guinea, where TOTAL has been active since 2012,
the Group owns a stake in Block PRL-15 (40.1%, operator since
2015). The State of Papua New Guinea retains the right to take a
stake in the license (when the final investment decision is made) at
amaximum level of 22.5%. In this case, TOTAL’s stake would be
reduced to 31.1%.

Block PRL-15 includes the two discoveries Elk and Antelope,
growth areas for the Group. A delineation program of these
discoveries is underway. The results of the first wells drilled have
confirmed the level of resources in the Elk and Antelope fields.

In 2015, the location of the various production sites was announced
to the authorities. In 2016, work on the development studies
continued and the Group carried out the environmental and societal
baseline studies in the country that are necessary for the granting
of authorization to start production in the fields.

In 2016, TOTAL signed an agreement to obtain a 35% stake in
exploration license PPL339, located in Gulf Province.

In 2016, the authorities awarded TOTAL (100%) deep offshore
exploration license PPL576 in the Coral Sea. A multi-client seismic
survey was performed on the block during the fourth quarter of 2016.

Rest of the zone of Asia-Pacific

TOTAL also holds interests in exploration licenses in Malaysia and
the Philippines. In Cambodia, TOTAL is working to implement an
agreement entered into in 2009 with the Cambodian government
for the exploration of Block 3 located in an area of the Gulf of
Thailand disputed by the governments of Cambodia and Thailand.
This agreement remains conditioned on the establishment by both
countries of an appropriate contractual framework.

2.1.2. Gas

The activities of TOTAL in the gas business have a primary objective
to contribute to the growth of the Group by ensuring market outlets
for its current and future natural gas production.

Beyond the production and liquefaction of natural gas (refer to point
2.1.1 of this chapter), TOTAL actively markets natural gas, which is
sold either by pipeline or in the form of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)
and develops a downstream portfolio for its trading and shipping
activities, as well as regasification terminals.

In order to enhance the value of the Group's gas resources, the
activities of Gas also include the trading and marketing of natural
gas, LNG, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and electricity as well as
shipping of LNG and LPG. The Group also has stakes in
infrastructure companies (including regasification terminals, natural
gas transportation and storage, and power plants) necessary to
implement its strategy.

2.1.2.1. Purchases, sales and shipping of LNG

A pioneer in the LNG industry, TOTAL is today one of the world’s
leading players") in the sector and has sound and diversified
positions both in the upstream and downstream portions of the
LNG chain. LNG development is a key element of the Group's
strategy, strengthening its positions in most major production zones
and markets.

Through its stakes in liquefaction plants located in Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates, Oman, Nigeria, Norway, Yemen, Angola and
Australia and its gas supply agreement with the Bontang plant in
Indonesia, the Group markets LNG in all global markets. In 2016,
the share of LNG production sold by TOTAL was 11 Mt, compared
to 10.2 Mt in 2015 and 12.2 Mt in 2014. The reduction between
2014 and 2015 was due to force majeure being declared in 2015
for the Yemen LNG® joint venture due to the deterioration of
security conditions. The growth of LNG production sold by TOTAL
over the coming years is expected to be ensured by the Group's
liquefaction projects under construction in Australia and Russia and
by projects currently under consideration, including a new project in
Papua New Guinea and the expansion of the Nigeria LNG plant.

In January 2017, TOTAL finalized the acquisition of approximately 23%
of Tellurian Investments Inc. (“Tellurian”), announced in December 2016,
in order to develop an integrated gas project, from the acquisition of gas
produced at a competitive cost in the United States to the delivery
of LNG to international markets from the Driftwood LNG terminal.
Driftwood LNG is in the engineering design and pre-filing phase.

Long-term Group LNG purchases and sales

TOTAL acquires long-term LNG volumes mainly from liquefaction
projects in which the Group holds an interest, including Qatargas 2
(Qatar), Yemen LNG (Yemen), Nigeria LNG (Nigeria) and Snghvit
(Norway). These volumes support the expansion of the Group's
worldwide LNG portfolio.

Since 2009, a growing portion of the long-term volume purchased
by the Group that was initially intended for delivery to North
American and European markets has been diverted to more
buoyant Asian markets.

(1) Company data, based on upstream and downstream LNG portfolios in 2016.

Business overview
Upstream segment

New LNG sources are expected to support the growth of the Group's
LNG portfolio, including Ichthys LNG (Australia), Yamal LNG®
(Russia), trains 3 and 5 of Sabine Pass LNG (United States) and
Cameron LNG (United States).

TOTAL has entered into several significant long-term agreements
throughout the world for the sale of LNG from the Group's global LNG
portfolio, notably in China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea and Spain.

LNG shipping

As part of its LNG transport activities, TOTAL uses two long-term
chartered LNG tankers: since 2006, the Arctic Lady, with a capacity
of 145,000 m8, and since 2011, the Meridian Spirit, with a capacity
of 165,000 ms, primarily for the transport of volumes from Snahvit
in Norway.

TOTAL continues to develop its fleet. The Group also signed a long-
term charter agreement in 2013 with SK Shipping and Marubeni
for two 180,000 ms LNG tankers. The vessels will serve to fulfill

the purchase obligations of Total Gas & Power Limited, including
commitments relating to the Ichthys and Sabine Pass projects.
They will be among the largest LNG tankers to navigate the
Panama Canal and are expected to be delivered in 2017 and 2018
respectively.

2.1.2.2. Trading

In 2016, TOTAL continued its strategy downstream from natural
gas and LNG production by developing its trading, marketing and
logistics activities. The aim of this strategy is to optimize access for
the Group's current and future production to markets supplied
based on long-term contracts and to markets open to international
competition (with short-term contracts and spot sales). Furthermore,
the Group is developing new LNG markets by promoting LNG
import infrastructure projects such as described in point 2.1.2.4,
below. The Group also has operations in electricity trading and the
marketing of LPG and petcoke. Since 2016, TOTAL has also been
active in the marketing of sulfur. In 2016, the Group stopped its
coal trading activities.

The trading teams are located in London, Houston, Geneva and
Singapore.

Gas and electricity

TOTAL is pursuing gas and electricity trading operations in Europe
and North America in order to sell the Group's production, to supply
its marketing subsidiaries and to support other entities of the Group.

In Europe, TOTAL traded 887 Bef (25.1 Bem) of natural gas in
2016, compared to 849 Bef (24 Bom) in 2015 and 911 Bef (25.8 Bem)
in 2014. The Group also traded 49.1 TWh of electricity in 2016,
compared to 41.1 TWh in 2015 and 44.8 TWh in 2014, mainly from
external sources.

In North America, TOTAL traded 356 Bef (10.1 Bem) of natural gas
in 2016 from its own production or from external resources compared
to 441 Bef (12.5 Bom) in 2015 and 593 Bef (16.8 Bem) in 2014.

(2) The Yemen LNG plant has been shut down since April 2015. For more information, refer to point 2.1.1.8 of this chapter.
(8) CAO Yamal LNG, which is developing the Yamal LNG project, is held by PAO Novatek (50.1%), Total E&P Yamal (20%), CNODC (20%), a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation,
and Sik Road Fund (9.9%). For information on international economic sanctions concerning Russia, refer to point 1.9 of chapter 4.

Business overview
Upstream segment

LNG

TOTAL operates LNG trading activities through both spot sales and
long-term contracts such as those described in point 2.1.2.1
above. Significant sales and purchase agreements (SPAs) have
permitted appreciable development of the Group's activities in LNG
trading, especially in the Asian markets (China, South Korea, India
and Japan). The spot and fixed-term LNG portfolio allows TOTAL to
supply gas to its main customers worldwide, while retaining a
sufficient degree of flexibility to react to market opportunities.

In 2016, TOTAL purchased 51 contractual cargoes under long term
contracts (from Qatar, Nigeria and Norway) and 19 spot or medium
term cargoes, compared to, respectively, 64 and 20 in 2015 and 88
and 7 in 2014. Deliveries from Yemen LNG have been interrupted
since April 2015.

LPG

In 2016, TOTAL traded nearly 5.3 Mt of LPG (propane and butane)
worldwide, compared to 5.8 Mt in 2015 and 5.5 Mt in 2014. Nearly
28% of these quantities come from fields or refineries operated by
the Group. This trading activity was conducted by means of 9 time-
chartered vessels. In 2016, 323 voyages were necessary for
transporting the negotiated quantities, including 217 journeys
carried out by TOTAL's time-chartered vessels and 106 journeys by
spot-chartered vessels.

Petcoke and sulfur

TOTAL has been trading petcoke produced since 2011 by the Port
Arthur refinery in the United States. 1.1 Mt of petcoke were sold
on the international market in 2016, compared to 1.1 Mt in 2015
and 1.3 Mt in 2014.

In 2014, TOTAL began trading petcoke from the Jubail refinery in
Saudi Arabia. In 2016, 890 kt were sold, compared to 720 kt in
2015 and 100 kt in 2014.

Petcoke is sold to cement producers and electricity producers
mainly in India, as well as in Mexico, Brazil and other Latin
American countries and in Turkey.

In 2016, TOTAL sold 0.7 Mt of sulfur, mainly from its refineries’
production.

2.1.2.3. Marketing

To optimize its position throughout the value chain and to leverage
the synergies from the Group's other activities, TOTAL has been
developing the business of marketing natural gas and electricity to
end users.

In the United Kingdom, TOTAL markets gas and electricity to the
industrial and commercial segments through its subsidiary Total
Gas & Power Ltd. In 2016, the volumes of gas sold were 143 Bef
(4.0 Bom), compared to 140 Bef (4.0 Bem) in 2015 and 135 Bef
(3.8 Bem) in 2014. Electricity sales were 7.4 TWh in 2016,
compared to 6.0 TWh in 2015 and 5.3 TWh in 2014.

In France, TOTAL operates in the natural gas market through

its marketing subsidiary Total Energie Gaz, the sales of which were
77 Bef (2.2 Bem) in 2016, compared to 84 Bef (2.4 Bem) in 2015
and 95 Bef (2.7 Bem) in 2014.

In Germany, Total Energie Gas GmbH, a marketing subsidiary

of TOTAL, marketed 29 Bef (0.9 Bcm) of gas in 2016 to industrial
and commercial customers, compared to 31 Bef (0.9 Bom) in 2015
and 24 Bef (0.7 Bem) in 2014.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016

In 2016, the volumes of gas delivered to the industrial and commercial
segments were 4 Bef (0.1 Bcm) in Belgium (Total Gas & Power
Belgium) and 9 Bef (0.3 Bcm) in the Netherlands (Total Gas & Power
Nederland B.V.), an increase with respect to previous years, these
two subsidiaries having started marketing gas in 2013.

In 2015, the natural gas marketing subsidiaries in France, Germany,
Belgium and the Netherlands extended their activities to the
marketing of electricity to industrial and commercial consumers.
The volumes sold in 2016 are still modest.

As part of its development strategy for its gas and electricity
marketing activities, TOTAL finalized in September 2016 the
acquisition of Lampiris, the third-largest gas and electricity supplier
in Belgium with more than 750,000 metering points. Lampiris is
also active in France, where it markets gas and electricity to the
residential and commercial segments.

In Spain, TOTAL markets natural gas to the industrial and
commercial segments through Cepsa Gas Comercializadora, in
which it holds a 35% stake. In 2016, the volumes of gas sold
reached 100 Bef (2.8 Bem), compared to 105 Bef (3.0 Bem) in
2015 and 94 Bef (2.7 Bem) in 2014.

In Argentina, the subsidiary Total Gas Marketing Cono Sur oversees
the marketing of gas on behalf of Total Austral, the Group's
production subsidiary in Argentina. In 2016, the volumes of gas
sold reached 142 Bef (4.0 Bom), compared to 128 Bef (3.6 Bom)

in 2015 and 131 Bef (3.7 Bom) in 2014.

The Group also holds stakes in the marketing companies that are
associated with the LNG regasification terminals located at Altamira
in Mexico and Hazira in India.

2.1.2.4. Gas facilities

Downstream from its natural gas and LNG production activities,
TOTAL holds stakes in natural gas transport networks and LNG.
regasification terminals.

Transportation and storage of natural gas

The Group holds stakes in several natural gas transportation
companies located in Brazil and Argentina. These companies are
facing a difficult operational and financial environment in Argentina.

In France, TOTAL sold in February 2016 its stake in Géosud, which
held an interest in Géométhane, a company that owns and
operates several natural gas storage caverns in Manosque.

LNG regasification

TOTAL has entered into agreements to obtain long-term access to
LNG regasification capacity worldwide: in the Americas (United
States, Mexico and Brazil), Europe (France and the United
Kingdom), Asia (India) and Africa (Céte d'Ivoire). This diversified
market presence allows the Group to access new liquefaction
projects by becoming a long-term buyer of a portion of the LNG
produced, thereby strengthening TOTAL's LNG supply portfolio.

In France, TOTAL holds a 27.5% stake in the company Fosmax
and has access to a regasification capacity of 78 Bef/y (2.25 Bem/y).
The terminal received 54 vessels in 2016, compared to 46 in 2015
and 2014.

TOTAL holds a 9.99% stake in Dunkerque LNG, which operates an
LNG receiving terminal with a capacity of 459 Bef/y (13 Bem/y).
Trade agreements have also been signed that allow TOTAL to
reserve up to 2 Bcm/y of regasification capacity over a 20-year
term. Commercial operations started on January 1, 2017.

In the United Kingdom, through its equity interest in the Qatargas
2 project, TOTAL holds an 8.35% stake in the South Hook LNG
receiving terminal with a total capacity of 742 Bef/y (21 Bem/y) and
an equivalent access right to the regasification capacity. The terminal
received 67 cargoes in 2016, compared to 84 in 2015 and 67 in 2014.

In Mexico, TOTAL has reserved 25% of the regasification capacity
of the Altamira receiving terminal, i.e., 59 Bef/y (1.7 Bem/y), through
its 25% stake in Gas del Litoral.

In the United States, TOTAL has reserved a regasification capacity
of approximately 353 Bef/y (10 Bem/y) in the Sabine Pass terminal
(Louisiana) for a 20-year period until 2029. In 2012, TOTAL and
Sabine Pass Liquefaction (SPL) signed agreements allowing SPL to
gradually obtain access to TOTAL's reserved capacity. Access to
38 Bef/y commenced in 2012, growing to 195 Bef/y from the start-
up of train 3 scheduled in 2017 and plateauing at substantially all of
TOTAL's capacity from the start-up of train 5 scheduled in 2019. In
return, SPL will pay TOTAL a fee linked to the capacity assigned.

In India, TOTAL holds a 26% stake in the Hazira receiving terminal,
with a regasification capacity of 244 Bcf/y (6.9 Bcm/y). Located in
the Gujarat state, this merchant terminal with operations that cover
both LNG regasification and gas marketing, received 60 vessels
(equivalent) in 2016, compared to 57 in 2015 and 465 in 2014.

In Céte d'Ivoire, a consortium led by TOTAL (34%, operator) has
been assigned responsibility for developing and operating an LNG
regasification terminal in Abidjan with a capacity of 3 Mt/y anda
start-up scheduled in 2018.

Business overview
Upstream segment

In Brazil, as part of its strategic alliance with Petrobras, the
definitive contracts of which were signed in February 2017, TOTAL
expects to proceed with the acquisition from Petrobras of
regasification capacity in the Bahia LNG terminal.

2.1.2.5. Electricity generation

In a context of increasing global demand for electricity, TOTAL has
developed expertise in the power generation sector, especially
through cogeneration and combined-cycle power plant projects.

In Abu Dhabi, the Taweelah A1 gas-fired power plant, which is
owned by Gulf Total Tractebel Power Company (TOTAL, 20%),
combines electricity generation and water desalination. The plant, in
operation since 2003, currently has a net power generation capacity
of 1,600 MW and a water desalination capacity of 385,000 m8 per
day. The plant's production is sold to Abu Dhabi Water and
Electricity Company (ADWEC) as part of a long-term agreement.

In Thailand, in September 2016 TOTAL sold the 28% stake it held
in Eastern Power and Electric Company Ltd which operates the
Bang Bo gas-fired combined cycle power plant with a capacity of
350 MW.

In Brazil, as part of its strategic alliance with Petrobras, TOTAL
expects to proceed with the acquisition from Petrobras of a 50%
interest in two co-generation plants located in the Bahia area.

2.1.2.6. End of coal production and trading

Following completion of the sale in 2015 of its subsidiary Total Coal
South Africa, the Group ceased its coal production activities. In
addition, in 2016 the Group ended its coal trading activities.

2.2.1. Refining & Chemicals

Refining & Chemicals includes the Group's refining, petrochemicals
and specialty chemicals businesses:

- the petrochemicals business includes base petrochemicals
(olefins and aromatics) and polymer derivatives (polyethylene,
polypropylene, polystyrene and hydrocarbon resins); and

- the specialty chemicals business covers elastomer processing.
The sales of electroplating chemistry (Atotech) and adhesives
(Bostik) activities were completed in early 2017 and in 2015,
respectively.

The volume of its Refining & Chemicals activities places TOTAL
among the top ten integrated chemical producers in the world".

The strategy of Refining & Chemicals integrates a constant
requirement of safety, a core value of the Group, and priority given
to respect of the environment. In a context of rising worldwide
demand for oil and petrochemicals driven by non-OECD countries
and the entry of new capacities into the market, the strategy
involves:

improving competitiveness of refining and petrochemicals
activities by making optimal use of industrial means of
production, concentrating investments on large integrated
platforms and adapting production capacity to changes in
demand in Europe;

developing petrochemicals in the United States and the Middle
East by exploiting the proximity of advantaged oil and gas
resources in order to supply growth markets, in particular Asia; and
innovating in low-carbon solutions/products by developing
biofuels and biopolymers as well as materials and solutions
contributing to the energy efficiency of the Group's customers,
in particular in the automotive market.

2.2.1.1. Refining and petrochemicals

TOTAL's refining capacity was 2,011 kb/d as of December 31,
2016, compared to 2,247 kb/d at year-end 2015 and 2,187 kb/d at
year-end 2014. TOTAL has equity stakes in 19 refineries (including
nine operated by companies of the Group), located in Europe, the
United States, Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

The Refining & Chemicals segment manages refining operations
located in Europe (excluding TotalErg in Italy), the United States, the
Middle East, Asia and Africa with a capacity of 1,962 kb/j at year-
end 2016, i.e., 98% of the Group's total capacity.

The petrochemicals businesses are located mainly in Europe, the
United States, Qatar, South Korea and Saudi Arabia. Most of these
sites are either adjacent to or connected by pipelines to Group
refineries. As a result, TOTAL's petrochemical operations are
integrated within its refining operations, thereby maximizing synergies.

Between 2011 and 2016, the Group reduced its production
capacities in Europe by 20%, thereby fully meeting the target it had
set itself for 2017. The year 2016 saw the continuation of plans to
adapt the Lindsey refinery in the United Kingdom with closure at the
end of September of one of the two atmospheric distillation towers,
and the La Méde refinery in France with stoppage in December of
the crude oil treatment prior to the transformation of the site into a

bio-refinery scheduled for 2018. TOTAL also continued to develop
its major investment project launched in 2013 on the integrated
Antwerp platform in Belgium, which is intended to improve the site’s
conversion rate.

Activities by geographical area

Europe
TOTAL is the largest refiner in Western Europe®).

Western Europe accounts for 72% of the Group's refining capacity, ie.
1,454 kb/d at year-end 2016, compared to 1,699 kb/d at year-end
2015 and 1,736 kb/d at year-end 2014, in line with the Group's
target of reducing capacity in Europe.

The Group operates eight refineries in Western Europe (one in
Antwerp, Belgium, five in France in Donges, Feyzin, Gonfreville,
Grandpuits and La Méde, one in Immingham in the United
Kingdom and one in Leuna, Germany) and owns stakes in the
Vlissingen refinery (Zeeland) in the Netherlands and the Trecate
refinery in Italy through its interest in TotalErg.

The Group's main petrochemical sites in Europe are located in
Belgium, in Antwerp (steam crackers, aromatics, polyethylene) and
Feluy (polyolefins, polystyrene), and in France, in Carling (polyethylene,
polystyrene), Feyzin (steam cracker, aromatics), Gonfreville (steam
crackers, aromatics, styrene, polyolefins, polystyrene) and Lavéra
(steam cracker, aromatics, polypropylene). Europe accounts for 49%
of the Group's petrochemicals capacity, e., 10,383 kt at year-end
2016, compared to 10,394 kt at year-end 2015 and 10,909 kt at
year-end 2014.

- In France, the Group continues to adapt its refining capacity and
to improve its operational efficiency against the backdrop of
structural decline in the demand for petroleum products in Europe.

In 2016, TOTAL continued the significant modernization plan
announced in April 2015 for its refining facilities in France, in
particular at La Méde, with an investment decision made in 2015
for over €200 million to transform the site and in particular create
the first bio-refinery in France. The first step relating to this
investment took place at the end of 2016 when the treatment of
crude oil was ended. The industrial transformation of La Méde
will allow TOTAL to respond to the growing demand for biofuel in
Europe. Other activities, such as a logistics and storage platform,
a solar energy farm, a training center and an AdBlue production
plant, will also be developed on the site.

In Donges, the €400 million investment project for the construction
of intermediate feedstock desulfurization units and hydrogen
production units is being considered. This program requires the
re-routing of the railroad track that currently crosses the refinery.

A three-party memorandum of intent to fund this re-routing work
between the state, local authorities and TOTAL was signed at the
end of 2015.

In 2014, the Group completed its industrial plan, launched in
2009, to reconfigure the Gonfreville refinery in Normandy by
commissioning a new diesel desulfurization unit. In addition,
the Group modernized production of specialty products on the
site and decreased the base oil production capacity.

Business overview
Refining & Chemicals segment

In petrochemicals, the Group reconfigured the Carling platform
in Lorraine. Steam cracking ended in October 2015. New
hydrocarbon resin and compound polypropylene production
units were commissioned in 2016.

In Germany, TOTAL operates the Leuna refinery (100%).

In 2015, the Group completed the sale of its stake in the Schwedt

refinery (16.7%) and acquired a majority stake in Polyblend, a

manufacturer of polyolefin compounds that are mainly used in

the automotive industry.

In Belgium, the Group launched a major project in 2013 to

modernize its Antwerp platform which is expected to be

commissioned in 2017:

- new conversion units in response to the shift in demand towards
lighter petroleum products with a very low sulfur content,

- anew unit to convert part of the combustible gases recovered
from the refining process into raw materials for the
petrochemical units.

In addition, the Group is developing a project to enable greater

flexibility on one of the steam-cracking units in order to process

European ethane as from 2017.

In the United Kingdom, TOTAL decreased the capacity of the

Lindsey refinery by half in 2016, reducing it to 5.5 Mt/y. The

investment plan also focused on improving the conversion ratio,

adapting logistics and simplifying the refinery’s organization,
thereby lowering the site’s break-even point.

North America

The Group’s main sites in North America are located in Texas,

at Port Arthur (refinery, steam cracker), Bayport (polyethylene) and
La Porte (polypropylene), and in Louisiana, at Carville (styrene,
polystyrene).

At Port Arthur, TOTAL holds at the same site a 100% interest in a
178 kb/d capacity refinery and a 40% stake in BASF Total
Petrochemicals (BTP), which has a condensate splitter and a steam
cracker. The Group continues to work on strengthening the
synergies between these two plants.

A pipeline connecting the Port Arthur refinery to the Sun terminal in
Nederland was commissioned in 2014 to facilitate access to all
domestic crudes, which are priced advantageously compared to
the international market. Following investments to adapt its
furnaces and the construction of a tenth ethane furnace, which was
commissioned in 2014, BTP’s cracker can produce more than 1
Mt/year of ethylene, including more than 85% from advantaged
feedstock (ethane, propane, butane). BTP thus benefits from
favorable market conditions in the United States. In addition,

in mid-2016, TOTAL completed detailed studies (FEED) for the
construction of a new ethane steam cracker with an ethylene
production capacity of 1 Mt/y on the Port Arthur site, in synergy
with the refinery and BTP steam cracker.

Asia, the Middle East and Africa
TOTAL is continuing to expand in growth areas and is developing
sites in countries with favorable access to raw materials. The Group

(1) TOTAL shareholdings: Qapco (20%); Qatofin (49%); RLOC (22.5%).

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016

has high-level platforms in these markets which are ideally
positioned for growth.

In Saudi Arabia, TOTAL has a 37.5% stake in the company
SATORP (Saudi Aramco Total Refining and Petrochemical Company),
which operates the Jubail refinery. It has been fully operational since
mid-2014 and technical and financial completions were reached in
June 2016. This refinery has an initial capacity of 400 kb/d and is
situated close to Saudi Arabia’s heavy crude oil fields. The refinery’s
configuration enables it to process these heavy crudes and sell
fuels and other light products that meet strict specifications and are
mainly intended for export. The refinery is also integrated with
petrochemical units: a 700 kt/y paraxylene unit, a 200 kt/y
propylene unit, and a 140 kt/y benzene unit.

In China, TOTAL holds a 22.4% stake in WEPEC, a company that
operates a refinery located in Dalian. Discussions are underway to
sell this stake to the Chinese partners of the joint venture.

The Group is also active through its polystyrene plant in Foshan in
the Guangzhou region and its polystyrene plant in Ningbo in the
Shanghai region, each with a capacity of 200 kt/y.

In South Korea, TOTAL has a 50% stake in Hanwha Total
Petrochemicals Co., Ltd. (“HTC”), which operates a petrochemical
complex in Daesan (condensate splitter, steam cracker, styrene,
paraxylene, polyolefins). Following the launch in 2014 of new
aromatics (paraxylene and benzene) and polymer units (EVA2), HTC
continued to expand its activities in 2015 with debottlenecking of
the steam cracker and a styrene unit thereby raising its ethylene
production capacity to 1.09 Mt/y and styrene production capacity
to 1.04 Mt/y. At the end of 2016, the EVA2 unit was
debottlenecked. In 2016, the Group benefited from these
investments in a favorable economic environment.

In Qatar, the Group holds interests" in two ethane-based steam
crackers (Qapco, Ras Laffan Olefin Cracker - RLOC) and four
polyethylene lines (Qapco, Qatofin), including the Qatofin linear low-
density polyethylene plant in Messaied with a capacity of 550 kt/y
and a 300 kt/y low-density polyethylene line operated by Qapco,
which started up in 2012. The Group is considering the
debottlenecking of these sites to optimize benefits from the
available ethane in the region.

TOTAL holds a 10% stake in the Ras Laffan condensate refinery,
the capacity of which increased to 300 kb/d following completion of
the project to double the refinery’s capacity; the new facilities were
commissioned in late 2016.

In Africa, the Group holds interests in four refineries (Cameroon,
Céte d'Ivoire, Senegal, South Africa) after the sale of its interest
in the refinery in Gabon in 2016. Refining & Chemicals provides
technical assistance for two of these refineries: the Natref refinery
with a capacity of 109 kb/d in South Africa and the SIR refinery
with a capacity of 80 kb/d in Céte d'Ivoire.

Development of new avenues for the production
of fuels and polymers

TOTAL is exploring new ways to monetize carbon resources,
conventional or otherwise (natural gas, biomass, waste). These projects
are part of the Group's commitment to building a diversified energy
mix generating lower CO, emissions.

As regards biomass development, TOTAL is pursuing several
industrial and exploratory projects. The scope of these developments
is broad since they entail defining access to the resource (nature,
sustainability, location, supply method, transport), the nature of the
molecules and target markets (fuels, petrochemicals, specialty
chemicals) and the most appropriate, efficient and environmentally
friendly conversion processes.

Biomass to fuels

In Europe, TOTAL produces biofuel, notably hydrotreated vegetable
oils (HVO) for incorporation into diesel, and ether produced from
ethanol and isobutene (ETBE) for incorporation into gasoline.

In 2016, the Group blended, at its European refineries and
several depots", 424 kt of ethanol®in gasoline, and 1,872 kt
of fatty-acid-methyl-ester (FAME) or HVO"!in diesel.

In addition, as part of the La Méde refinery transformation program
announced in 2015, the Group will construct the first bio-refinery in
France. Work is expected to begin in 2017 with a view to reaching
a production capacity of almost 500 kt/y of biofuel, mainly high-quality
biodiesel (HVO), but also biojet and petrochemical bio-feedstocks.
This will therefore allow the La Méde plant to meet the growing
biofuel market. Furthermore, the Group entered into a partnership
in 2016 with Suez to increase the supply and the recycling of used
cil, which could then be processed at La Méde.

In 2016, TOTAL engaged in extensive research activity targeting the
emergence of new biofuel solutions. Construction now underway
as part of the BioTFuel consortium of a pilot demonstration unit on
the Dunkirk site is expected to lead to commencement in 2017 of a
gasification test program for conversion of biomass into fungible,
sulfur-free fuels.

(1) Excluding the Group's participation in TotalErg.

Biomass to polymers

TOTAL is actively involved in developing activities associated

with the conversion of biomass to polymers. The main area of focus
is developing drop-in solutions for direct substitutions, by incorporating
biomass into the Group's existing units, for example HVO or other
hydrotreated vegetable oil co-products in a naphtha cracker, and
developing the production of new molecules such as polylactic acid
polymer (PLA). Thus, in November 2016, the Group signed a
cooperation agreement with Corbion to create a joint venture for
construction of a PLA production site in Thailand.

2.2.1.2. Specialty chemicals

As part of active management of its business portfolio, TOTAL
completed in early 2017 the sale of its subsidiary Atotech,
specialized in electroplating technologies. In 2016, Atotech had
almost 4,000 employees with 18 production sites in the world and
its sales were €1 billion ($1.1 billion). In 2015, TOTAL also completed
the sale of its subsidiary Bostik, specialized in adhesive chemicals.

Hutchinson actively contributes to the mobility of the future by
addressing its customers’ needs (automotive, aerospace and major
industries — defense, rail, energy) in order to offer a greater level of
safety, comfort and energy performance, as well as more responsible
solutions.

The company draws on wide-ranging expertise and deploys its
know-how from the custom design of materials to the integration of
connected solutions: structural sealing solutions, precision sealing,
management of fluids, materials and structures, anti-vibration
systems and transmission systems.

To serve its customers, Hutchinson had 89 production sites across
the world (of which 56 are located in Europe and 18 in North America)

2.2.2.1. Trading

In 2016, crude oil prices reached their lowest point in January and
then strengthened progressively, while remaining low, with high
volatility and a reduction in the contango" structure of certain oil
indexes compared with 2015. Significant storage capacities in
different parts of the world, made available through leases,
contributed to the strong performance of Trading's activities. The
Group's offices in Houston and Singapore also contributed to the
growth of results by expanding their respective activities.

TOTAL is one of the world’s largest traders of crude oil and
petroleum products on the basis of volumes traded. The table
below presents Trading’s worldwide crude oil sales and supply
sources and petroleum products sales for each of the past three
years. Trading of physical volumes of crude oil and petroleum
products amounted to 5.6 Mb/d in 2016, compared to 5.2 Mb/d in

Trading operates extensively on physical and derivatives markets,
both organized and over the counter. In connection with its Trading
activities, TOTAL, like most other oil companies, uses derivative
energy instruments (futures, forwards, swaps and options) with the
aim of adjusting its exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil
and petroleum products. These transactions are entered into with a
wide variety of counterparties.

For additional information concerning derivatives transactions by
Trading & Shipping, see Note 16 (Financial instruments related to
commodity contracts) to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(refer to point 7 of chapter 10).

All of TOTAL's Trading activities are subject to strict internal controls
and trading limits.

(1) Contango is the price structure where the prompt price of an index is lower than the future price.

2.2.2.2. Shipping

The transportation of crude oil and petroleum products necessary
for the activities of the Group is coordinated by Shipping. These
requirements are fulfilled through balanced use of the spot and
time-charter markets. The additional transport capacity can also be
used to transport third-party cargo. Shipping maintains a rigorous
safety policy, mainly through a strict selection of chartered vessels.

In 2016, Shipping chartered approximately 2,900 voyages (relatively
stable compared to 2015 and 2014) to transport 131 Mt of crude oil
and petroleum products, compared to 126 Mt in 2015 and 122 Mt
in 2014. On December 31, 2016, the mid- and long-term chartered
fleet amounted to 59 vessels (including 8 LPG vessels), compared
to 55 in 2015 and 48 in 2014. None of these vessels is single-hulled
and the average age of the fleet is approximately six years.

Like a certain number of other oil companies and ship owners, the
Group uses freight rate derivative contracts to adjust Shipping's
exposure to freight rate fluctuations.

Business overview
Marketing & Services segment

The Group is active along the entire solar photovoltaic value chain,
with SunPower and Total Solar, from the production of photovoltaic
cells to the development of solar farms or installation of solar
facilities in private households.

Over the longer term, it pursues a second axe of development with
the transformation of biomass through biotechnology, which aims
to develop new biosourced product solutions for transportation
and chemicals.

TOTAL actively follows developments in other renewable energies.
In this context, the Group owns a farm of four wind turbines (10 MW
near Dunkirk, France) and a stake in marine energy (9.99% in the
company Scotrenewables Tidal Power, Scotland).

The acquisition of Saft Groupe S.A. in 2016 is consistent with this
ambition. The Group plans to pursue its investments in low-carbon
businesses.

2.3.2.1. Solar energy

TOTAL acquired a majority share in SunPower in 2011. In addition,
the Group develops and holds interests via Total Solar in solar
farms and is pursuing R&D investments in the photovoltaic field
through several industrial and academic partnerships.

The steady reduction in photovoltaic electricity costs opens an
ever-growing number of markets. However, in some areas,
achievement of the full potential of this technology requires the
support of public programs.

SunPower

TOTAL holds 56.73% of SunPower as of December 31, 2016,

an American company listed on NASDAQ and based in California.
As an integrated player, SunPower operates over the entire solar
power value chain. Upstream, it designs, manufactures and
supplies cells as well as the highest-efficiency solar panels on the
market. Downstream, SunPower is active in the design and
construction of large turnkey power plants and in the marketing of
integrated solar solutions for decentralized electricity generation.

Upstream, SunPower manufactures all its cells in Asia (Philippines,
Malaysia) and has a nominal production capacity of approximately
1,050 MW/y at year-end 2016. Through its significant R&D
program, the company is constantly optimizing its production process
to reduce costs while maintaining its technological leadership. The
cells are assembled into modules, or solar panels, in plants located
mainly in Mexico and Europe.

To extend its commercial offering, from 2016 SunPower has marketed
anew lower-priced modules range to target the most competitive market
sectors while continuing to hold a technical edge over its competitors.

Downstream, SunPower markets its panels worldwide for
applications ranging from residential and commercial roof tiles to
large solar power plants. SunPower installed more than 1.3 GW in
2016 compared to 1.2 GW in 2015. As of December 31, 2016,
SunPower holds a 36.53% stake in the company 8point3 Energy
Partners, initially set up with First Solar. 8point3 Energy Partners, the
purpose of which is to acquire and operate solar projects, was listed
on NASDAQ in 2015. Additionally, in 2016 SunPower completed the
construction in the United States of the solar farm Boulder Solar 1
(125 MWc) and the Henrietta farm (128 MWc). SunPower also
completed construction of the Prieska farm (86 MWe) in South Africa.

(1) Company data.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016

SunPower is pursuing its development in residential and commercial
markets, in particular in the United States, by increasing its service
offerings for solar power production, management and financing.
SunPower is also developing its Smart Energy activity to permit its
residential and commercial customers to optimize their power
consumption. Thus in 2016, SunPower launched a pilot project in
New York State involving electricity production and consumption
management with a storage offer in association with the local
electricity provider.

The second half of 2016 was marked by a sharp deterioration of
the global market, in a context of strong overcapacity of photovoltaic
cells production. SunPower announced an adjustment plan to cope
with this market deterioration. This plan is essentially based on a
reduction of the company’s operational costs and on the closure of
a cells manufacturing unit in the Philippines.

In this context, TOTAL and SunPower decided to deepen their
cooperation through several strategic initiatives. In particular, in
November 2016, TOTAL concluded an agreement with SunPower
to supply the panels required for retrofitting over the next five years
5,000 service stations and approximately 100 other sites across
the world for an installed capacity of 200 MW. In addition, TOTAL
undertook via Total Solar the acquisition of projects developed

by SunPower in Japan, South-Africa and France.

Other solar assets

The Group holds a 20% stake in the solar power plant Shams 1,
commissioned in 2013 in Abu Dhabi. With 109 MW of parabolic

2.3.2.2. Energy storage

Energy storage is one of the solutions that can offset the
intermittent nature of renewable energies, thereby increasing their
profitability and facilitating their development. The Group has
invested in this area since 2009 via collaborative R&D programs
with academic partners and minority stakes in start-ups, through
among others Total Energy Ventures, a venture capital company
(refer to point 2.3.5 of chapter 7).

The acquisition of 100% of the shares of Saft Groupe S.A. (“Saft”),
completed in August 2016 following a successful voluntary
takeover bid, is fully in line with TOTAL's goal to develop in the
renewable energies and electricity businesses.

Saft is a French company founded in 1918 specializing in the
design, manufacture and marketing of high technology batteries for
industry. In 2016, Saft achieved sales of €738 million, including
75% on markets where it is the leader", such as nickel and primary
lithium batteries for industrial infrastructure, transport and civil and
military electronics applications. It also develops batteries for space
and defense using its lithium-ion technologies, which are also
deployed in the domains of energy storage, transport and
telecommunications networks. Building on its technological
expertise, the company is well positioned to benefit from growth in
renewable energies beyond its current activities.

As of year-end 2016, Saft is present in 19 countries in the world
(historically Europe and the United States) and has over 4,000
employees. It is achieving steady growth in emerging countries, in
particular in Asia, South America and Russia, and has 14 production
sites and approximately 30 sales offices.

2.3.2.3. Biotechnologies and the conversion of biomass

TOTAL has launched numerous collaborative R&D projects for the
development of bio-sourced molecules with various academic
partners (the Joint BioEnergy Institute in the United States, the
University of Wageningen in the Netherlands) and industrial partners
in Europe (the Toulouse White Biotechnology consortium) and in the
United States (Amyris Inc., Novogy). Amyris Inc. is an American
company listed on NASDAQ, in which TOTAL holds an interest of
23.51% as of December 31, 2016. It produces biojet fuel from
farnesane, which has been used successfully in demonstration
flights, notably with Air France, KLM and Cathay Pacific.

TOTAL is exploring a number of opportunities for developing
biomass. In particular, TOTAL has invested in the start-up
Renmatix, which is developing an innovative technology involving
the deconstruction of lignocellulose into fermentable sugars.

This is in addition to the action already initiated by the Group within
the French consortium Futurol for the conversion of lignocellulose
into ethanol.

In 2015 and 2016, TOTAL also acquired two new R&D platforms:
one at Emeryville in California (United States) dedicated to the
development of processes for fermenting and separating molecules
from biotechnologies, and the other at Solaize (France) with the
goal of developing new biocomponents by implementing predictive
retrosynthesis methodologies.

In the longer term, the Group is also studying the potential for
developing a cost-effective phototrophic process for producing
biomolecules through microalgae bioengineering.

(0) Organic investments = net investments, excluding acquisitions, divestments and other operations with non-controliing interests.

In 2016, the Group's organic investments and resource acquisitions
were $18.3 billion. The decrease in investments compared to 2015
follows the completion and start-up of nine major production growth
projects in 2015 and five in 2016. The reduction also resulted from

a successful capital efficiency program implemented in response to
the fall in Brent prices.

In the Upstream segment, most of the investments were geared
toward the development of new hydrocarbon production facilities,
the maintenance of existing facilities and exploration activities.
Development expenditures were mainly related to the five projects
that started up in 2016 (Laggan-Tormore, Vega Pleyade, Incahuasi,
Angola LNG and Kashagan) and to other major projects under
construction and expected to start up in 2017 and 2018, including
Moho North in the Republic of the Congo, Yamal LNG in Russia,
Ichthys LNG in Australia, Kaombo in Angola and Egina in Nigeria.

In the Refining & Chemicals segment, investments were made
in facilities maintenance and safety, as well as in projects aimed
at improving the plants’ competitiveness. In 2016, the Group
progressed with the transformation of the La Méde refinery in

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016

France into a bio-refinery and the modernization of the Antwerp
refinery in Belgium with the addition of a new heavy fuel oil
conversion unit and another petrochemical unit, and reduced by
50% the capacity of the Lindsey oil refinery in the United Kingdom.

In the Marketing & Services segment, investments in 2016 mainly
concerned retail networks in growth regions, logistics and specialty
products production and storage facilities.

Acquisitions in 2016 totaled $2.0 billion, including $780 million of
resource acquisitions, a 41% decrease compared to $3.4 billion
in 2015.

The Group took advantage of favorable market conditions to
expand its Upstream portfolio. The Group strengthened its position
in the Middle East by entering the Al Shaheen field in Qatar, and in
the US with the acquisition of shale gas assets. Resources
acquisitions were $780 million in 2016, comprised mainly of the
additional 75% interest in the Barnett shale gas field in the United
States. The Group is preparing future growth with the signing of
major deals in Brazil with Petrobras, in Uganda and in Iran on the
giant South Pars 11 project.

As part of the development of profitable low-carbon businesses,
the Group acquired Saft Groupe, a leader in energy storage solutions.
In line with the strategy to expand its gas and power distribution
activities, the Group also acquired Lampiris, a supplier of natural gas
and energy services in Belgium and France. Finally, in the Marketing &
Services segment, the Group announced the planned acquisition of
a retail and supply terminal network in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania
to strengthen its marketing and supply activities in the region.

The Group also continued its divestment program of mature and
non-core assets for a total of $1.9 billion in 2016, including the sale

of a 15% stake in the Gina Krog field in Norway and a 20% stake in
the Kharyaga field in Russia, as well as the sale of the FUKA
pipeline system in the North Sea and a retail network in Turkey. The
Group also finalized in January 2017 the sale of Atotech, a plating
chemistry company, for $3.2 billion, which was announced in 2016.

The $10 billion asset sale program for 2015-2017 was around 80%
complete following the closing of the Atotech sale in 2017.

Net investments were $17.8 billion in 2016, compared
to $20.4 billion in 2015, a decrease of 13% essentially related to the
decrease in organic investments.

Investments are moving into the sustainable range needed to
deliver profitable future growth and are expected to be between
$16 and $17 billion in 2017 including resource acquisitions.

Investments in the Exploration & Production segment will be largely
allocated to major development projects under construction,
including Moho North in the Republic of the Congo, Yamal LNG in
Russia, Ichthys LNG in Australia, Kaombo in Angola and Egina in
Nigeria as well to a number of new projects expected to be
launched this year. A portion of the funds will also be allocated to
assets already in production, in particular for maintenance capital
expenditures and in-fill wells.

In the Refining & Chemicals segment, the modernization of the
Antwerp integrated platform and the transformation of the La Méde
refinery to a bio-refinery will be among the major investments

in 2017. The Group is also progressing plans for the construction
of a side cracker at the Port Arthur refinery complex in the United
States. A significant portion of the segment's budget will also

be allocated to required maintenance and safety investments.

The Marketing & Services segments investment budget will,
finance, in particular, the service station network, logistics, specialty
products production and storage facilities, particularly lubricants.

Most of the Marketing & Services budget will be allocated to growth
regions, notably Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

The Group will also continue investing to grow its Downstream gas
and renewables businesses through the newly established Gas,
Renewables and Power segment, as well as in R&D.

TOTAL self-finances most of its investments with cash flow from
operating activities and occasionally accesses the bond market
when financial market conditions are favorable. Investments for joint
ventures between TOTAL and external partners are generally
funded through specific project financing.

As part of certain project financing arrangements, TOTAL S.A. has
provided guarantees. These guarantees (“Guarantees given on
borrowings”) as well as other information on the Group's off-
balance sheet commitments and contractual obligations appear in
Note13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (point 7 of
chapter 10). The Group currently believes that neither these
guarantees nor the other off-balance sheet commitments of TOTAL
S.A. or of any other Group company have, or could reasonably
have in the future, a material effect on the Group's financial position,
income and expenses, liquidity, investments or financial resources.

Business overview
Research & Development

4. Research & Development

The Group's overall R&D investments were $1,050 million in 2016,
compared to $980 million in 2015 and $1,245 million in 2014.
There were 4,939 people dedicated to R&D activities in 2016
compared to 4,248 in 2015 and 4,596 in 2014").

TOTAL invested $689 million in 2016 in innovation and R&D for its
cil and gas activities“. The expenses dedicated to these activities are
expected to increase by 5% on average between 2015 and 2017.

R&D at TOTAL focuses on six major axes:

developing knowledge, tools and technological expertise to
discover and profitably produce complex oil and gas resources at
a reduced cost to help meet the global demand for energy;
developing, industrializing and improving competitive processes
for the conversion of oil, gas and biomass resources to adapt to
changes in resources and markets, improve reliability and safety,
achieve better energy efficiency, reduce the environmental
footprint and maintain profitability in the long term;

developing and industrializing solar, biomass and carbon capture
and storage technologies to help prepare for future energy needs
in an economically competitive manner;

developing practical, innovative and competitive materials and
products that meet customers’ specific needs, contribute to the
emergence of new features and systems, enable current
materials to be replaced by materials delivering higher
performance to users, and address the challenges of improved
energy efficiency, lower environmental impact and toxicity, better
management of their life cycle and waste recovery;
understanding and measuring the impacts of the Group's
operations and products on ecosystems (water, soil, air, biodiversity)
and recovering waste to improve environmental safety, as part of
the regulation in place, and reduce their environmental footprint to
endeavor to achieve sustainability in the Group's operations; and

4.1. Upstream

mastering and using innovative technologies such as
biotechnologies, materials sciences, nanotechnologies, high-
performance computing, information and communication
technologies or new analytical techniques.

These issues are incorporated into the project portfolio to develop
synergies. Different aspects may be looked at independently by
different business segments, with high levels of interaction between
R&D, technology and business unit teams.

Since 2009, Total Energy Ventures, which is in charge of developing
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) specialized in innovative
energy technologies and clean technologies for the Group,
manages a portfolio that has grown regularly. In addition, a loan
facility was introduced for innovative SMEs that develop
technologies of interest for the Group.

In 2016, a Group R&D Division was set up as part of the Group's
new organization, “One Total” (refer to point 1.3 of this chapter).
This new division is in charge of:

constructing a consolidated view of all of the Group’s R&D
activities and putting in place an R&D roadmap taking into
account the 2°C scenario of the IAE;

launching and monitoring transversal studies on key subjects for
the Group, such as CO, capture, use and storage, health, safety
and the environment (HSE) and energy efficiency;

increasing synergies between R&D teams by facilitating the
sharing of tools, expertise and, when needed, resources,
selecting and respecting good practices, and capitalizing on
scientific expertise; and

ensuring the transfer of technologies towards the Group's
industrial and commercial activities.

In Exploration & Production, the R&D project portfolio was reviewed
in 2016 according to the impacts on reducing costs and the
environmental footprint, and on improving safety and production.
More than half of the R&D budget is focused on improving
exploration (geological structures, seismic acquisition and imaging
technologies), characterization of hydrocarbon reservoirs and
simulation of field evolution during production. Enhancing oil
recovery from mature reservoirs remains an active area of research,
particularly in the Group's partnerships in the Middle East.

R&D activities in deep offshore aiming at greater distances for
multiphase production transport have been increased further, which
is fully in line with the goals of Exploration & Production and
supports major technology-intensive assets such as Libra in Brazil.

Operations on wells, from drilling to closure, account for a
significant share of Upstream costs; new R&D projects are under
way to reduce these and further increase operational safety.

The monitoring phase of the oxy-combustion CO, capture and storage
project in the depleted Rousse reservoir in Lacg (France) came to an

end in 2016. The Group now has a strong command of the methods
used to characterize reservoirs and their mechanical properties for this
type of injection. New R&D projects are being identified in order to
develop carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) in the coming years.

A sustained effort to adapt mature technologies in order to reduce their
costs has been implemented. In particular, new technologies addressing
the management of water associated with hydrocarbon production are
now available for new developments. This subject is part of a larger
program dedicated to Sustainable Development. The increased use of
digital technology also forms part of this cost-reduction program.

Finally, R&D programs prepare for the medium and long terms,
whether for researching new exploration concepts, non-
conventional resources or developing technologies, such as
robotics, nanotechnologies or high-performance computing
(notably, the Pangea supercomputer, a decision-support tool for
exploration and field management).

Concerning the activities of Gas, the program to develop new
technological acid gas treatment and LNG solutions is continuing.

4.2. Refining & Chemicals

Business overview
Research & Development

4.2.1. Refining & Chemicals
(excluding specialty chemicals)

The aim of R&D is to support the medium and long-term
development of Refining & Chemicals. In doing so, it contributes to
the technological differentiation of this business through the
development, implementation and promotion of effective R&D
programs that pave the way for the industrialization of knowledge,
processes and technologies.

In line with Refining & Chemicals’ strategy, R&D places special
emphasis on the following four major challenges: taking advantage
of different types of feedstock; maximizing asset value; continuing
to develop innovative products; and developing biosourced
products. The medium-term strategy of the project portfolio and its
deployment plan will facilitate Refining & Chemicals’ technological
differentiation.

To take advantage of different types of feedstock, R&D activities
related to the processing of more diversified crudes have increased
significantly through a clearer insight into the effect that feedstocks
have on equipment and processes at the molecular level. R&D is
launching ambitious new programs to develop various technologies
for producing liquid fuels, monomers and intermediates from gas.

R&D is developing expertise and technologies with a view to
maximizing asset value. Its efforts mainly involve programs focusing
on the flexibility and availability of facilities. Advanced modeling of
feedstocks and processes helps the units overcome processing-
related constraints and operate while taking these constraints into
account in real time. Research conducted on catalysts is helping to
increase their resistance, improve catalytic stability and extend the
cycle time at a lower cost. Programs are being set up to maximize
the value of heavy residues. The new opportunities presented by
digital technology are being examined to pave the way for the
“plant of the future”, which will provide an even safer working
environment and increased productivity, while consuming less
energy and producing less waste.

In line with the Group's low-carbon strategy, R&D is pioneering
solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through carbon
capture and recovery by conversion. In addition, out of concern for
the environmental footprint of Refining & Chemicals’ activities, R&D is
developing new technologies to improve the energy efficiency of
facilities and reduce the impact of the activities on water, air, soil, etc.

The offer of innovative products is a key aspect of research on
polymers. R&D draws on its knowledge of metallocenes and

4.3. Marketing & Services

bimodality to develop different types of mass consumption
polymers that have exceptional properties allowing them to replace
heavier materials and compete with technical polymers. Value-
added niche polymers are also being developed, whether in the
form of blends or composites. Efforts to diversify into biosourced
products are focused mainly on products endorsed by the market:
biomonomers, biointermediates, and biopolymers. R&D is thus
focusing on polylactic acid due to the new applications that can be
envisaged as a result of its specific properties. For plastics
recycling, R&D is designing technologies that will make it possible
to recycle polymers under acceptable conditions in terms of end
product quality, cost and environmental impact.

With regard to biofuels, R&D has directed its efforts towards
gasification and coprocessing to produce liquid fuels from biomass.
R&D is also particularly mindful of issues related to blends and
product quality raised by the use of biomolecules.

The efficient use of resources is a major challenge for Sustainable
Development. As a result, R&D is pioneering technologies enabling
more efficient use of biosourced molecules to produce higher
added-value chemical compounds, whether through biotechnologies
or thermochemical processes.

4.2.2. Specialty chemicals

R&D is strategically important for specialty chemical products.
It is closely linked to the needs of the subsidiaries and industrial
customers.

For Hutchinson, R&D is an important factor in innovation and
differentiation. The company is present along the entire value chain,
from designing custom materials (e.g., rubber, thermoplastics,
composites) to incorporating connected solutions (e.g., complex
solutions, mechatronics, connected objects).

With a corporate research and innovation center, more than

25 technical centers and a number of university partnerships
worldwide, Hutchinson is equipped to rise to the challenge of
contributing to the safer, more comfortable, and more responsible
mobility of the future.

Weight reduction, increased energy efficiency and improved
diagnostic and control functionality are common preoccupations
across all of Hutchinson's markets (e.g., automotive, aerospace,
defense, railways). Hutchinson designs innovative solutions to put
its customers ahead of the game, and transposes those solutions
between markets, adopting a cross-fertilization approach.

4.3.1. Marketing & Services

In 2016, the R&D activities of Marketing & Services continued to roll
out its new roadmap in line with its ambitions.

The roadmap features two focal points: reducing the environmental
footprint of products, particularly CO, emissions, and increasing
energy efficiency by improving the durability of end users’
equipment. These are broken down into a number of areas: energy
savings for customers; competitive advantage and new solutions;
anticipation of changes in legislation; and incorporation of
biosourced molecules.

Anew “Chemicals and biocomponent processes” department
shared by the Marketing & Services and Refining & Chemicals
segments opened in April 2016 on the Solaize site, with the aim of
using a predictive approach to design components derived from
renewable sources. This approach uses cheminformatics and
digital tools to simulate, model and predict how the components
will perform, in order to help chemists and formulators better
identify ideal chemical structures.

The “Fuel Economy” range of lubricants continues to expand with
many new products designed to comply with the specifications of

manufacturers targeted by the Total Lubricants business line in all
fields of application (automotive, marine and manufacturing). The
key work is focused on the design and incorporation of
breakthrough components in formulations. At the same time, more
fundamental work has been started to anticipate the issues that
manufacturers will face as a result of changes in engine technology
and legislation. New contracts have been won with strategic
manufacturers. In addition, the new marine lubricant for two-stroke
engines that run on fuels with sulfur contents of 0 to 3.5% has been
introduced onto the market. The International Maritime
Organization's recent decision to limit the sulfur content of fuels to
0.5% by 2020 has led to the redefinition of marine lubricant
development programs.

Launched in 2015, the project to synthesize new molecules for
future generations of the “Total Excellium” fuel range is based on
the areas of chemicals, methods & measurements and
benchmarking. Alongside this, work to develop new products
tailored to specific local requirements has been finalized, mainly for
the African market.

In the field of refinery additives, research continued into
understanding and developing new additives to improve the
performance of distillates in cold temperatures.

With respect to bitumen, in order to meet the challenges of
competitiveness, sustainable logistics, Sustainable Development
and geographic expansion in the bitumen sector, researchers
mainly concentrated on the prospect of transporting bitumen in
solid form, establishing a program to reduce binder aging and
developing Styrelf formulas for the international market.

The new “Bio Life” range of special fluids derived from renewable
sources was put on the market. It is protected by several patent
applications covering the production methods and applications of
the fluids.

In Formula 1 racing, important work on understanding combustion
and lubrication phenomena, in conjunction with closer technical ties
with manufacturers, once again brought very significant
improvements in engine performance in 2016. As a result of this
collaboration, new skills have been acquired in-house that can be
used in other areas (e.g., production vehicles, electric engines).

The Asia-Pacific Technical Center based in Mumbai, India,
increased its activities and skills, mainly in lubricants (particularly for
textiles and two-wheeled vehicles), special fluids (including drilling
fluids) and fuel additives.

The enlisting of French and international skills has increased in
recent years, with a growing number of ties to academia,
researchers seconded to universities in France, Italy, Switzerland
and the United States, and international researchers recruited. R&D
has also increased its activities relating to evaluating and selecting
external technologies and partners with shared interests (SMEs,
start-ups). These different approaches enhance the work necessary
for the guided design and development of breakthrough products
included in Marketing & Services’ objectives.

4.3.2. New Energies

New Energies’ R&D efforts are focused, on the one hand, on the
solar value chain from silicon to photovoltaic electricity
management systems, and, on the other hand, on the development
of biotechnological methods of converting biomass into products of
interest to the Group's markets.

In the field of solar energy, R&D is striving to improve SunPower'’s"
methods of producing cells and modules in order to drive down
costs while enhancing efficiency and reliability, with the aim of
maintaining the company’s global technological leadership and
tailoring its offering to the different application markets, from solar
farms to the residential sector. It is also preparing future generation
photovoltaic cells within the framework of several strategic
partnerships between TOTAL and renowned academic research
institutes. In particular, TOTAL is the founding partner of the lle-de-
France Photovoltaic Institute, a research institute on the Paris-
Saclay campus that has reached critical mass and offers a very
high-quality technical platform and scientific support structure with
the ambitious aim of identifying breakthrough technologies to
produce highly efficient, low-cost panels.

Downstream in the solar value chain, R&D is monitoring the
development of low-cost stationary storage technologies. At the
same time, Saft Groupe’s R&D teams are focusing on improving
lithium-ion technologies, reducing costs and environmental impact,
and developing management systems. This last activity provides a
link to the R&D activities of New Energies, which is preparing
solutions for supplying solar power and associated services to
residential markets by developing software tools and algorithms for
the intelligent management of domestic electricity production and
consumption, and also by integrating and testing systems
combining photovoltaics, storage, control of demand as well as
pilots for assessing and improving systems and algorithms in
contact with customers.

With regard to biotechnologies, the Group is developing methods
for converting sugars into biofuels and molecules of interest for
chemicals, as well as processes for the deconstruction of
lignocellulose into sugars. To support its ambitions, the Group has
set up laboratories, including one research center specializing in
fermentation and another specializing in predictive approaches, a
cutting-edge technology for anticipating the properties of
components and providing a better response to future needs, with
unprecedented performance levels. To this end, TOTAL’s biotech
research team heads up a network of partners including academic
laboratories and start-ups in the United States and Europe.

2016 results and outlook
Summary of results and financial position

1. Summary of results and financial position

1.1. Overview of the 2016 fiscal year for TOTAL

After falling from 100 $/b in 2014 to 52 $/b on average in 2015,
Brent prices were highly volatile in 2016, fluctuating between 27 $/b
and 58 $/b, with an average of 44 $/b for the year. In this difficult
environment, the Group demonstrated its resilience by generating
adjusted net income of $8.3 billion and had the highest profitability
among the majors due to the strength of its integrated model and
commitment of its teams to reduce the breakeven.

The Group's resilience was supported by outstanding production
growth over the past two years (14.3%, including 4.5% in 2016).
In the Upstream, the Group strengthened its position in the Middle
East by entering the Al Shaheen field in Qatar, and in the United
States with the acquisition of shale gas assets. The Group is
preparing future growth with the signing of major deals in Brazil
with Petrobras, in Uganda and in Iran on the giant South Pars 11
project. The Group renewed its reserves with a replacement rate
of 136% at constant prices and delivered promising exploration
results, with two major discoveries in the United States (North
Platte) and Nigeria (Owowo).

Despite lower refining margins, the Downstream" once again
achieved its objectives and thereby demonstrated that its results
are sustainable, with operating cash flow before working capital
changes of $7 billion! and ROACE® above 30%, the highest

(1) Refining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services segments, excluding New Energies.

among the majors. Results from the Refining & Chemicals segment
were underpinned by the strong performance of its Asia and Middle
East integrated platforms, while Marketing & Services results were
driven by growth in retail and lubricants.

Financial discipline was successfully maintained across all business
segments both for investments ($18.3 billion including resource
acquisitions) and operating costs, with savings of $2.8 billion in
2016, exceeding the objective of $2.4 billion. Production costs were
reduced to 5.9 $/boe in 2016, compared to 9.9 $/boe in 2014.

The $10 billion asset sale program is around 80% complete following
the closing of the Atotech sale, and this contributed to the Group's
financial strength with a net-debt-to-equity ratio at 27%, lower than
it was in 2014.

In this context, the Board of Directors proposes to increase the dividend,
despite the volatility of hydrocarbon prices, to 2.45 €/share,
corresponding to a fourth quarter dividend of 0.62 €/share,

a 1.6% increase compared to the previous three quarterly dividends.
This demonstrates the Board's confidence in the strength of the
Group's results and balance sheet as well as its prospects for cash
flow growth.

(2) Operating cash flow before working capital changes, previously referred to as adjusted cash flow from operations, is defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in working
capital at replacement cost. Replacement cost is expiained in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (refer to point 7 of chapter 10).

1.2.1. Sales

Consolidated sales in 2016 were $149,743 million compared
to $165,357 million in 2015, a decrease of 9%. The decrease in
hydrocarbon prices and refining margins were partially offset by
production growth and strong results for petrochemicals.

1.2.2. Operating income from business segments

The average Brent price was 44 $/b in 2016, a 17% decrease over
one year. The Group’s European Refining Margin Indicator (“ERMI”")
was 34 $/t in 2016, a 30% decrease compared to the high levels in
2015, in the context of high petroleum product stocks. The environment
for petrochemicals remained favorable. The euro remained stable
compared to the U.S. dollar, at 1.11 $/€ on average in 2016.

2016 results and outlook
Summary of results and financial position

Given this less favorable environment than in 2015, adjusted net
operating income from the business segments was $9,420 million
in 2016, a decrease of 17% over one year.

The effective tax rate" for the business segments was 25.8%

in 2016 compared to 33.9% in 2015, due to the relative weight
and lower tax rates in the Upstream in a lower hydrocarbon price
environment.

1.2.3. Net income (Group share)

Adjusted net income was $8,287 million in 2016 compared

to $10,518 million in 2015, a decrease of 21%. Adjusted net income
excludes the after-tax inventory effect, special items and the effect
of changes in fair value.

Adjustment items had a negative impact on net income of $2,091 million
in 2016, mainly due to the inventory effect and impairments

on Gladstone LNG in Australia, Angola LNG, and Laggan-Tormore
in the United Kingdom, reflecting the decrease in gas price
assumptions for the coming years.

Given these items, net income (Group share) was $6,196 million
in 2016 compared to $5,087 million in 2015, a 22% increase.

Adjusted fully-diluted earnings per share, based on 2,390 million
fully-diluted weighted-average shares, was $3.38 in 2016
compared to $4.51 in 2015.

1.3. Upstream segment results

The number of fully-diluted shares was 2,436 million on December 31,
2016, compared to 2,336 million on December 31, 2015.

1.2.4. Investments — divestments

Asset sales were $1,864 million in 2016, mainly comprised of the
sale of a 15% interest in the Gina Krog field in Norway, the FUKA gas
pipeline network in the North Sea and the retail network in Turkey.

Acquisitions, including resource acquisitions were $2,033 million in
2016, mainly comprised of the additional 75% interest in the Barnett
shale gas field in the United States, and the acquisitions of Saft
Groupe, Lampiris and a retail network in the Dominican Republic.

Resource acquisitions were $780 million in 2016, comprised mainly
of the additional 75% interest in the Barnett shale gas field in the
United States. These acquisitions, at a cost of less than one dollar
per barrel, enabled the Group to achieve its objective of adding
‘one billion barrels of resources in 2016. Organic investments and
resource acquisitions were $18,264 million in 2016.

1.2.5. Profitability
In 2016, the ROACE® was 7.5% and the ROE" was 8.7%.

In 2016, hydrocarbon production was 2,452 kboe/d, an increase
of 4.5% compared to 2015, due to the following:

+6% due to new start ups and ramp ups, notably Laggan-Tormore,
Surmont Phase 2, Termokarstovoye, Gladstone LNG, Moho
Phase 1b, Vega Pleyade and Incahuasi;

-1.5% due to the security situation in Nigeria and Yemen, and
wild fires in Canada;

natural field decline was offset by PSC price effect and portfolio
effects.

Upstream adjusted net operating income was $3,633 million in 2016,
a decrease of 24% compared to 2015. The increase in production

combined with the decrease in operating costs as well as the lower
effective tax rate partially offset the impact of lower hydrocarbon prices.

Technical costs for consolidated subsidiaries, calculated in accordance
with ASC 932!, were reduced to 20.4 $/boe in 2016 compared to

23.0 $/boe in 2015. This decrease was essentially due to the reduction
in operating costs from 7.4 $/boe in 2015 to 5.9 $/boe in 2016.

The Board of Directors met on February 8, 2017 and decided to
propose to the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting, which will be held
on May 26, 2017, an annual dividend of 2.45 €/share for 2016, an
increase compared to 2015. Given the three previous 2016 interim

(a) Net cash flow = cash flow from operating activities before working capital changes at replacement cost — net investments (including other transactions with non-controling interests).

The Group's net cash flow was -$1,236 million in 2016 compared
to -$414 million in 2015. This change is essentially due to the decrease
in cash flow from operations as a result of lower hydrocarbon prices
and refining margins, partially offset by the 15% decrease in net

net-debt-to-equity ratio of 27% at end 2016, a decrease compared
to 28% at end 2015.

Liquidity and capital resources

2.3. Borrowing requirements and funding structure

The Group's policy consists of incurring long-term debt at a floating
rate or at a fixed rate depending on the interest rates at the time of
issue. Debt is incurred in dollars or euros depending on the Group's
general corporate needs. Long-term interest rate and currency swaps.
may be used to hedge bonds at their issuance in order to create

a variable or fixed rate synthetic debt. In order to partially modify
the interest rate structure of long-term debt, TOTAL may also enter
into long-term interest rate swaps.

The non-current financial debt is generally raised by the corporate
treasury entities either directly in dollars or euros or in other currencies
which are then exchanged for dollars or euros through swap issues
to appropriately match general corporate needs.

As of December 31, 2016, the Group's long-term debt, after taking
into account the effect of currency and interest rate swaps, was 95%
in dollars and 72% at floating rates. In 2015, these ratios were 93%
and 82% respectively.

In addition to its bond issuance programs, in 2015 and 2016
TOTAL S.A. issued perpetual subordinated notes in several tranches:

- February 19, 2015, €5 billion in two tranches;
- May 11, 2016, €1.75 billion in one tranche; and
- September 29, 2016, €2.5 billion in two tranches.

2.4. External financing available

In accordance with IAS 32 provisions “Financial instruments -
presentation", given the nature of these notes, they have been
recognized in the accounts as equity.

Furthermore, on November 25, 2015, TOTAL S.A. issued a $1.2 billion
bond combining cash-settled convertible bonds indexed to TOTAL's
share performance and the purchase of stock options to hedge the
risk of additional costs related to this indexation. This combination
creates a non-dilutive synthetic instrument equivalent to a standard
bond. At maturity, all transactions are made in cash and limited

to the nominal amount.

The Group has established standards for market transactions under
which bank counterparties must be approved in advance, based on
an assessment of the counterparty’s financial soundness (multi-criteria
analysis including a review of the market capitalization and of the Credit
Default Swap (CDS), its ratings with Standard & Poor's and Moody's,
which must be of high quality, and its overall financial condition).

An overall authorized credit limit is set for each bank and is allocated
among the subsidiaries and the Group's central treasury entities
according to their needs.

To reduce the market values risk on its commitments, in particular
for swaps set as part of bonds issuance, the Group also entered
into margin call contracts with its significant counterparties.

As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate amount of the major
confirmed credit facilities granted by international banks to the
Group’s companies (including TOTAL S.A.) was $11,164 million
(compared to $11,225 million on December 31, 2015), of

which $10,724 million were unused (compared to $11,225 million
unused on December 31, 2015).

TOTAL S.A. has confirmed lines of credit granted by international
banks, which are calculated to allow it to manage its short-term
liquidity needs as required. As of December 31, 2016, these credit
facilities amounted to $10,076 million (compared to $10,675 million
on December 31, 2015), of which $10,076 million were unused
(compared to $10,675 million unused on December 31, 2015).

2.5. Anticipated sources of financing

The agreements for the lines of credit granted to TOTAL S.A. do not
contain conditions related to the Company's financial ratios, to its
financial ratings from specialized agencies, or to the occurrence of
events that could have a material adverse effect on its financial position.

Credit facilities granted to Group companies other than TOTAL S.A.
are not intended to finance the Group’s general needs; they are
intended to finance either the general needs of the borrowing
affiliate or a specific project.

As of December 31, 2016, no restrictions applied to the use
of the Group companies’ capital (including TOTAL S.A.) that could
significantly impact the Group's activities, directly or indirectly.

Investments, working capital and dividend payments are financed
essentially by cash flow from operations, asset disposals and,
if necessary, by net borrowings.

For the coming years and based on the current financing conditions,
the Company intends to maintain this method of financing the Group's
investments and activities.

2016 results and outlook
Trends and outlook. Significant changes

3. Trends and outlook

3.1. Outlook

Brent increased following the announced production cuts agreed
by OPEC and non-OPEC countries, including Russia. However,
inventory levels are high and prices are likely to remain volatile.

In this context, the Group is continuing to cut costs with the objective
of achieving $3.5 billion of cost savings in 2017 and bringing
production costs down to 5.5 $/boe for the year. Investments

are moving into the sustainable range needed to deliver profitable
future growth and are expected to be between $16 and $17 billion
in 2017 including resource acquisitions.

In the Upstream, production is set to grow by more than 4% in 2017,
supporting the objective of increasing production on average by 5%
per year from 2014 to 2020. As a result of this growth, the sensitivity
of the portfolio to Brent increases to $2.5 billion for a 10 $/b change
in Brent in 2017. The Group plans to take advantage of the favorable
cost environment by launching around 10 projects over the next

18 months and adding attractive resources to the portfolio.

3.2. Risks and uncertainties

In 2017, the Downstream is expected to continue generating stable
operating cash flow before working capital changes of around $7 billion
thanks to its diverse portfolio of activities. Refining & Chemicals’
performance has been strengthened by the restructuring and the
segment will continue to benefit from the quality of its integrated
platforms, notably in Antwerp, in the United States, in Asia and in
the Middle East. The final investment decision to launch the Port Arthur
side-cracker is expected to be made in 2017. The Marketing & Services
segment is pursuing its cash generation growth strategy by leveraging
its strong position in high-potential retail and lubricant markets.

In 2017, the Group expects its breakeven will continue to fall,
reaching less than 40 $/b pre-dividend. Cash flow from operations
is expected to cover investments and the cash portion of the
dividend at 50 $/b. TOTAL confirms its medium-term objective

to achieve a net-debt-to-equity ratio of 20%.

The Group is committed to maintaining attractive returns for its
shareholders and will eliminate the discount on the scrip dividend
with Brent at 60 $/b.

Due to the nature of its business, the Group's activities remain
subject to the usual market risks (sensitivity to the environmental
parameters of the oil and financial markets), industrial and environmental
risks related to its operations, and to political or geopolitical risks
stemming from the global presence of most of its activities.

Risks and control
Risk Factors

1. Risk Factors

The Group conducts its activities in an ever-changing environment
and is exposed to risks that, if they were to occur, could have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, including
its operating income and cash flow, reputation or outlook.

The Group employs a continuous process of identifying and
analyzing risks in order to determine those that could prevent it
from achieving its objectives. This chapter presents the significant
risks to which the Group believes it is exposed as of the date of this
Registration Document. However, as of such date, the Group may

not be aware of other risks that could, or other risks may not have
been considered by the Group as being likely to, have a material
adverse impact on the Group, its business, financial condition,
including its operating income and cash flow, reputation or outlook.

The main internal control and risk management procedures, which
are part of the report of the Chairman of the Board of Directors
prepared pursuant to Article L. 225-37 of the French Commercial
Code, are described in point 4 of this chapter.

1.1. Risks related to market environment and other financial risks

The financial performance of TOTAL is sensitive to a number of
market environmentrelated factors, the most significant being
hydrocarbon prices, refining margins and exchange rates.

Generally, a decline in hydrocarbon prices has a negative effect on
the Group's results due to a decrease in revenues from oil and gas
production. Conversely, a rise in hydrocarbon prices increases the
Group's results.

In 2016, crude oil prices reached their lowest point in January and
then strengthened progressively, notably due to the OPEC/non-
OPEC agreement concluded in November 2016, while remaining
low. The market remains highly volatile.

For the year 2017, according to the scenarios retained below, the
Group estimates that an increase of $10 per barrel in the price of
Brent crude would increase annual adjusted net operating income")
by approximately $2 billion and cash flow from operations by
approximately $2.5 billion. Conversely, a decrease of $10 per barrel
in the price of Brent crude would decrease annual adjusted net
operating income by approximately $2 billion and cash flow from
operations by approximately $2.5 billion.

The impact of changes in crude oil and gas prices on downstream
operations depends upon the speed at which the prices of finished
products adjust to reflect these changes. The Group estimates that
a decrease in its European Refining Margin Indicator (“ERMI")

of $10 per ton would decrease annual adjusted net operating
income by approximately $0.5 billion and cash flow from operations
by approximately $0.6 billion. Conversely, an increase in its ERMI

of $10 per ton would increase annual adjusted net operating
income by approximately $0.5 billion and cash flow from operations
by approximately $0.6 billion.

All of the Group's activities are, for various reasons and to varying
degrees, sensitive to fluctuations in the dollar/euro exchange rate.
The Group estimates that a decrease of $0.10 per euro
(strengthening of the dollar versus the euro) would increase
adjusted net operating income by approximately $0.1 billion and
have a limited impact on cash flow from operations. Conversely, an
increase of $0.10 per euro (weakening of the dollar versus the euro)
would decrease adjusted net operating income by approximately
$0.1 billion and have a limited impact on cash flow from operations.

Market impact Scenario Change Estimated impact Estimated impact

Brent 50 $/o +10 $/b +2 BS +2.5 BS
European Refining Margin Indicator (ERMI) 35 Sit -10 St -0.5 BS -0.6 BS

(2) Sensitivities revised once per year upon publication of the previous year's fourth quarter results. Indicated sensitivities are approximate and based upon TOTAL's current view of its 2017
portfolio. Results may differ significantly from the estimates implied by the application of these sensitivities. The impact of the $/€ sensitivity on adjusted net operating income is

primarily attributable to the Refining & Chemicals segment.

In addition to the adverse effect on the Group’s revenues,
margins and profitability, a prolonged period of low oil and
natural gas prices could lead the Group to review its projects
and the evaluation of its assets and oil and natural gas reserves.

Prices for oil and natural gas may fluctuate widely due to many
factors over which TOTAL has no control. These factors include:

- variations in global and regional supply of and demand for energy;

- global and regional economic and political developments in
natural resource-producing regions, particularly in the Middle
East, Africa and South America, as well as in Russia;

the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting

Countries (OPEC) and other producing nations to influence global

production levels and prices;

- prices of unconventional energies as well as evolving approaches
for developing oil sands and shale oil, which may affect the
Group's realized prices, notably under its long-term gas sales
contracts and asset valuations, particularly in North America;

- cost and availability of new technology;

- regulations and governmental actions;

- global economic and financial market conditions;

(1) Adjusted results are defined as income at replacement cost, excluding non-recurring items and the impact of fair value changes.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016


--- Page 58 ---

- the security situation in certain regions, the magnitude of
international terrorist threats, war or other conflicts;

- changes in demographics, including population growth rates and
consumer preferences; and

- adverse weather conditions that can disrupt supplies or interrupt
operations of the Group's facilities.

Prolonged periods of low oil and natural gas prices may reduce the
economic viability of projects in production or in development, and
reduce the Group's liquidity, thereby decreasing its ability to finance
capital expenditures and/or causing it to cancel or postpone
investment projects.

If TOTAL were unable to finance its investment projects, the
Group's opportunities for future revenue and profitability growth
would be reduced, which could materially impact the Group's
financial condition, including its operating income and cash flow.

Prolonged periods of low oil and natural gas prices may reduce the
Group's reported reserves and cause the Group to revise the price
assumptions upon which asset impairment tests are based that
could have a significant adverse effect on the Group's results in the
period in which it occurs. For additional information on impairments.
recognized on the Group's assets, refer to Note 3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements (point 7 of chapter 10).

Conversely, in a high oil and gas price environment, the Group can

experience significant increases in cost and government take, and,
under some production-sharing contracts, the Group's production

rights could be reduced. Higher prices can also reduce demand for
the Group's products.

The Group's earnings from its Refining & Chemicals and

Marketing & Services segments are primarily dependent upon the
supply and demand for petroleum products and the associated
margins on sales of these products, with the impact of changes in
cil and gas prices on earnings on these segments being dependent
upon the speed at which the prices of petroleum products adjust to
reflect movements in oil and gas prices. In 2016, the negative
effects of lower oil and gas prices on the Group's results were

Risks and control
Risk Factors

partially offset by the results of the Refining & Chemicals segment.
During 2016, the Group’s refining margins, while remaining at a
good level, fluctuated throughout the year. In 2017, there can be no
assurance that the Group’s refining margins will remain at such level.

The activities of Trading & Shipping (oil, gas and power trading and
shipping activities) are particularly sensitive to market risk and more
specifically to price risk as a consequence of the volatility of oil and
gas prices, to liquidity risk (inability to buy or sell cargoes at market
prices) and to counterparty risk (when a counterparty does not fulfill
its contractual obligations). The Group uses various energy
derivative instruments and freight-rates instruments to adjust its
exposure to price fluctuations of crude oil, petroleum products,
natural gas, power and freight-rates. Although TOTAL believes it
has established appropriate risk management procedures, large
market fluctuations may adversely affect the Group's activities and
financial condition, including its operating income and cash flow.

For more detailed information on the impact of the lower oil and gas
prices on the Group's 2016 results, financial condition (including
impairments, significant reductions to capital expenditures and
operating costs, and divestments completed under the Group's
asset sale program) and outlook, refer to chapter 3.

TOTAL is exposed to other financial risks related to its
financing and cash management activities.

The Group is exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign
exchange rates. Even though the Group generally seeks to
minimize the currency exposure of each entity to its functional
currency (primarily the dollar, the euro, the pound sterling and the
Norwegian krone), the Group's financial condition, including its
operating income and cash flow, could be impacted by a significant
change in the value of these currencies. In addition, as TOTAL
mostly turns to financial markets for its financing, its financial
condition and operations could be materially impacted if access to
those markets were to become more difficult. For further
information on financial risks, refer to Notes 15 and 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements (point 7 of chapter 10).

1.2. Industrial and environmental risks and risks related to climate issues

TOTAL is exposed to risks related to the safety and security of
its operations.

The Group's activities involve a wide range of operational risks,
such as explosions, fires, accidents, equipment failures, leakage of
toxic products, emissions or discharges into the air, water or soil,
that can potentially cause death or injury, or impact natural
resources and ecosystems.

The industrial event that could have the most significant impact is a
major industrial accident, e.g., blow out, explosion, fire, leakage of
highly toxic products or massive leakage, resulting in death or injury
and/or accidental pollution on a large-scale or at an environmentally
sensitive site.

Acts of terrorism or malicious acts against the Group's employees,
plants, sites, pipelines and transportation or computer systems
could also disrupt the Group's business activities and could cause
harm or damage to people, property and the environment.

Certain activities of the Group face specific additional risks. TOTAL’s
Upstream segment is exposed to risks related to the physical
characteristics of oil and gas fields, particularly during drilling

operations, which can cause blow outs, explosions, fires or other
damage, in particular to the environment, and lead to a disruption
of the Group's operations or reduce its production. In addition to
the risks of explosions and fires, the activities of the

Refining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services business segments
entail risks related to the overall life cycle of the products
manufactured, as well as the materials used. With regard to
transportation, the likelihood of an operational accident depends
not only on the hazardous nature of the products transported, but
also on the volumes involved and the sensitivity of the regions
through which they are transported (quality of infrastructure,
population density, environmental considerations).

TOTAL's workforce and the public are exposed to risks inherent to
the Group's operations, which could lead to legal proceedings
against the Group's entities and legal representatives, notably in
cases of death, injury and property and environmental damage.
Such proceedings could also damage the Group's reputation. In
addition, like most industrial groups, TOTAL is affected by reports of
occupational illnesses, particularly those caused by past exposure
of Group employees to asbestos.

Risks and control
Risk Factors

To manage the operational risks to which it is exposed, the Group
has adopted a preventive and remedial approach by putting in
place centralized HSE (healty, safety and environment) and security
management systems that seek to take all necessary measures to
reduce the related risks (refer to point 4.3.1 of this chapter). In
addition, the Group maintains worldwide third-party liability
insurance coverage for all its subsidiaries. TOTAL also has
insurance to protect against the risk of damage to Group property
and/or business interruption at its main refining and petrochemical
sites. TOTAL's insurance and risk management policies are
described in point 3 of this chapter. However, the Group is not
insured against all potential risks. In certain cases, such as a major
environmental disaster, TOTAL liability may exceed the maximum
coverage provided by its third-party liability insurance. The Group
cannot guarantee that it will not suffer any uninsured loss and there
can be no guarantee, particularly in the event of a major environmental
disaster or industrial accident, that such loss would not have a
material adverse effect on the Group's financial condition, including
its operating income and cash flow, and its reputation.

Crisis management systems are necessary to effectively
respond to emergencies, avoid potential disruptions to
TOTAL’s business and operations and minimize impacts on
third parties or the environment.

TOTAL has crisis management plans in place to deal with emergencies
(refer to point 4 of this chapter). However, these plans cannot exclude
the risk that the Group’s business and operations may be severely
disrupted in a crisis situation or ensure the absence of impacts on
third parties or the environment. TOTAL has also implemented
business continuity plans to continue or resume operations
following a shutdown or incident. An inability for the Group to
resume its activities in a timely manner could prolong the impact of
any disruption and thus could have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, including its operating income and cash flow.

TOTAL is subject to increasingly stringent environmental,
health and safety laws and regulations in numerous countries
and may incur material related compliance costs.

The Group's activities are subject to numerous laws and regulations
pertaining to the environment, health and safety. In most countries
where the Group operates, particularly in Europe and the United
States, sites and products are subject to increasingly strict laws
governing the protection of the environment (e.g., water, air, soil,
noise, protection of nature, waste management, impact assessments),
health (e.g., occupational safety, chemical product risk), and the
safety of personnel and residents.

Product quality and consumer protection are also subject to
increasingly strict regulations. The Group's entities ensure that their
products meet applicable specifications and abide by all applicable
consumer protection laws. Failure to do so could lead to personal
injury, property damage, environmental harm and loss of customers,
which could negatively impact the Group's financial condition,
including its operating income and cash flow, and its reputation.

TOTAL incurs, and will continue to incur, substantial expenditures to
comply with increasingly complex laws and regulations aimed at
protecting health, safety and the environment. Such expenditures
could have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial condition.

(1) As from 2021 or the current price in a given country.

The introduction of new laws and regulations could compel the
Group to curtail, modify or cease certain operations or implement
temporary shutdowns of facilities, which could diminish its productivity
and have a material adverse impact on its financial condition.

Moreover, most of the Group's activities will eventually, at site
closure, require decommissioning followed by environmental
remediation after operations are discontinued, in compliance with
applicable regulations. Costs related to such activities may
materially exceed the Group's provisions and adversely impact its
operating results. With regard to the permanent shutdown of an
activity, the Group's environmental contingencies and asset
retirement obligations are addressed in the “Asset retirement
obligations” and “Provisions for environmental contingencies”
sections of the Group's consolidated balance sheet (refer to Note
12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, point 7 of chapter
10). Future expenditures related to asset retirement obligations are
accounted for in accordance with the accounting principles
described in the same Note.

Laws and regulations related to climate change may adversely
affect the Group’s business and financial condition.

Growing public concern over greenhouse gas (“GHG") emissions
and climate change, which notably led to the signature of the Paris
Agreement on December 12, 2015 as part of the United Nations
Climate Change Conference (COP 21), is likely to continue to lead
to further regulation in these areas. These additional regulatory
requirements could lead the Group to curtail, change or cease
certain of its operations, and submit the Group's facilities to
additional compliance obligations, which could adversely affect the
Group's businesses and financial condition, including its operating
income and cash flow.

Regulations designed to gradually limit fossil fuel use may,
depending on the GHG emission limits and time horizons set,
negatively and significantly affect the development of projects, as
well as the economic value of certain of the Group's assets. Internal
studies conducted by TOTAL have shown that a long term CO,
price of $40/t" applied worldwide would have an impact of around
5% on the discounted present value of the Group's assets
(upstream and downstream) ®!. In response to these possible
developments, natural gas, which is the fossil energy that emits the
least amount of GHG, represented nearly 48% of TOTAL'’s
production in 2016, compared to approximately 35% in 2005, and
the Group's objective is to grow this percentage over the long term
with the expected growth of gas markets. In addition, the Group
ceased its coal production activities and is developing its activities
in the realms of solar energy production and energy from biomass
(renewable energies).

In Europe, the regulations concerning the market for CO, emission
allowances, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS), entered a
third phase on January 1, 2013. This phase marks the end of the
overall free allocation of emission allowances: certain emissions,
such as those related to electricity production, no longer benefit
from free allowances, while for others free allowances have been
significantly reduced. Free allocations are now established based
on the emission level of the top-performing plants (i.e., the least
GHG-emitting) within the same sector (“top 10 benchmark”).
Lower-performing plants must purchase, at market price, the

(2) Sensitivity calculated for a crude oil price of $60/80/b compared to a reference scenario that takes into account a CO, price in the regions already covered by a carbon pricing system.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016


--- Page 60 ---

necessary allowances to cover their emissions over these free
allocations. The plants also need to indirectly bear the cost of
allowances for all electricity consumed (including electricity
generated internally at the facilities).

The 2014 update to the EU-ETS list of sectors exposed to carbon
leakage confirmed that refining activities in Europe are an exposed
sector and should continue to benefit from free allocations partially
covering its deficits. Based on available information, the Group has.
estimated that approximately 25% of its emissions subject to the
EU-ETS will not be covered by free allowances during the period
2013-2020 and at least 30% during the period 2021-2030. The
financial risk related to the foreseeable purchase of CO, emission
allowances on the market is expected to rise due to the effects of
the ongoing reform of the EU-ETS. At year-end 2016, the price

of CO, emission allowances stood at approximately €6/t CO,.

The forecast for 2020 indicates that the price could rise to
approximately €20/t" CO, due to the combined effects of
backloading” (having removed 900 Mt from phase 3 allowance
auctions), of the foreseeable cancellation of quotas and the
establishment of a “market stability reserve” at the end of this
phase. The Group believes that the price of CO, emission

allowances could rise to at least €30/t during phase 4 (2021-2030).

Risks and control
Risk Factors

The physical effects of climate change may adversely affect
the Group’s business.

TOTAL's businesses operate in varied locales where the potential
physical impacts of climate change, including changes in weather
patterns, are highly uncertain and may adversely impact the results
of the Group's operations.

Climate change potentially has multiple effects that could harm the
Group's operations. The increasing scarcity of water resources may
negatively affect the Group's operations in some regions of the
world, high sea levels may harm certain coastal activities, and the
multiplication of extreme weather events may damage offshore and
onshore facilities. These climate risk factors are continually
assessed in TOTAL’s management and risk management plans.

The Group believes that it is impossible to guarantee that the
contingencies or liabilities related to the matters mentioned in point
1.2 of this chapter will not have a material adverse impact on its
business, financial condition, including its operating income and
cash flow, reputation or outlook.

1.3. Risks related to critical IT systems security

Disruption to or breaches of TOTAL’s critical IT services or
information security systems could adversely affect the
Group’s operations.

The Group's activities depend heavily on the reliability and security
of its information technology (IT) systems. If the integrity of its IT
systems were compromised due to, for example, technical failure,

cyber attack, viruses and computer intrusions, power or network
outages or natural disasters, the Group's activities and assets could
sustain serious damage, material intellectual property could be
divulged and, in some cases, personal injury, property damage,
environmental harm and regulatory violations could occur,
potentially having a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial
condition, including its operating income and cash flow.

1.4. Risks related to the development of major projects and reserves

The Group’s production growth and profitability depend on the
delivery of its major development projects.

Growth of production and profitability of the Group rely heavily on
the successful execution of its major development projects that are
increasingly complex and capital-intensive. These major projects
may face a number of difficulties, including, in particular, those
related to:

economic or political risks, including threats specific to a certain
country or region, such as terrorism, social unrest or other
conflicts (refer to point 1.6 of this chapter);

negotiations with partners, governments, local communities,
suppliers, customers and other parties;

obtaining project financing;

controlling capital and operating costs;

earning an adequate return in a low oil and/or gas price
environment;

adhering to project schedules; and

the timely issuance or renewal of permits and licenses by public
agencies.

(1) Company data.

Poor delivery of any major project that underpins production or
production growth could adversely affect the Group's financial
condition, including its operating income and cash flow.

The Group’s long-term profitability depends on cost-effective
discovery, acquisition and development of economically viable
new reserves; if the Group is unsuccessful, its financial
condition, including its operating income and cash flow, would
be materially and adversely affected.

A large portion of the Group's revenues and operating results are
derived from the sale of oil and gas that the Group extracts from
underground reserves developed as part of its

Exploration & Production activities. The development of oil and gas
fields, the construction of facilities and the drilling of production or
injection wells is capital intensive and requires advanced
technology. Due to constantly changing market conditions and
environmental challenges, cost projections can be uncertain. For
TOTAL's Exploration & Production activities to continue to be
profitable, the Group needs to replace its reserves with new proved
reserves that can be developed and produced in an economically
viable manner.

Risks and control
Risk Factors

In addition, TOTAL's ability to discover or acquire and develop new
reserves successfully is uncertain and can be negatively affected by
a number of factors, including:

the geological nature of oil and gas fields, notably unexpected
drilling conditions including pressure or unexpected
heterogeneities in geological formations;

the risk of dry holes or failure to find expected commercial
quantities of hydrocarbons;

equipment failures, fires, blow-outs or accidents;

shortages or delays in the availability or delivery of appropriate
equipment;

the Group's inability to develop or implement new technologies
that enable access to previously inaccessible fields;

the Group's inability to anticipate market changes in a timely manner;
adverse weather conditions;

the inability of the Group's partners to execute or finance projects
in which the Group holds an interest or to meet their contractual
obligations;

the inability of service companies to deliver contracted services
on time and on budget;

compliance with both anticipated and unanticipated
governmental requirements, including U.S. and EU regulations
that may give a competitive advantage to companies not subject
to such regulations;

economic or political risks, including threats specific to a certain
country or region, such as terrorism, social unrest or other
conflicts (refer to point 1.6 of this chapter);

competition from oil and gas companies for the acquisition

and development of assets and licenses (refer to point 1.7

of this chapter);

increased taxes and royalties, including retroactive claims and
changes in regulations and tax reassesments;

disputes related to property titles.

These factors could lead to cost overruns and could impair the
Group's ability to complete a development project or make
production economical. Some of these factors may also affect the
Group's projects and facilities further down the oil and gas chain.

If TOTAL fails to develop new reserves cost-effectively and in
sufficient quantities, the Group's financial condition, including its
operating income and cash flow, could be materially affected.

The Group’s oil and gas reserves data are estimates only and
subsequent downward adjustments are possible. If actual
production from such reserves proves to be lower than current

estimates indicate, the Group’s financial condition, including
its operating income and cash flow, could be negatively impacted.

The Group's proved reserves figures are estimates prepared in
accordance with SEC rules. Proved reserves are those reserves
which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically

recoverable — from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and
under existing economic conditions, operating methods and
government regulations — prior to the time at which contracts
providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that
renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or
probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Reserves are
estimated by teams of qualified, experienced and trained
geoscientists, petroleum engineers and project engineers, who
rigorously review and analyze in detail all available geoscience and
engineering data (e.g., seismic data, electrical logs, cores, fluids,
pressures, flow rates, facilities parameters). This process involves
making subjective judgments, including with respect to the estimate
of hydrocarbons initially in place, initial production rates and
recovery efficiency, based on available geological, technical and
economic data. Consequently, estimates of reserves are not exact
measurements and are subject to revision.

A variety of factors that are beyond the Group's control could cause
such estimates to be adjusted downward in the future, or cause the
Group's actual production to be lower than its currently reported
proved reserves indicate. Such factors include:

- aprolonged period of low prices of oil or gas, making reserves
no longer economically viable to exploit and therefore not
classifiable as proved;

an increase in the price of oil or gas, which may reduce the
reserves to which the Group is entitled under production sharing
and risked service contracts and other contractual terms;
changes in tax rules and other regulations that make reserves no
longer economically viable to exploit; and

the actual production performance of the Group's deposits.

The Group's reserves estimates may therefore require substantial
downward revisions should its subjective judgments prove not to
have been conservative enough based on the available geoscience
and engineering data, or the Group's assumptions regarding factors
or variables that are beyond its control prove to be incorrect over
time. Any downward adjustment could indicate lower future
production amounts, which could adversely affect the Group's
financial condition, including its operating income and cash flow.

1.5. Risks related to equity affiliates and management of assets operated

by third parties

Many of the Group’s projects are conducted by equity affiliates
or are operated by third parties. For these projects, the Group’s
degree of control, as well as its ability to identify and manage
risks, may be reduced.

A significant number of the Group's projects are conducted by
equity affiliates. In cases where the Group's company is not the
operator, such company may have limited influence over, and
control of, the behavior, performance and costs of the partnership,
its ability to manage risks may be limited and it may, nevertheless,
be prosecuted by regulators or claimants in the event of an incident.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016

For additional information, refer to Note 8 (“Equity affiliates, other
titles and related parties”) to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(point 7 of chapter 10).

Additionally, the partners of the Group may not be able to meet
their financial or other obligations to the projects, which may
threaten the viability of a given project. These partners may also not
have the financial capacity to fully indemnify the Group or third
parties in the event of an incident.

With respect to joint ventures, contractual terms generally provide
that the operator, whether an entity of the Group or a third party,
assumes full liability for damages caused by its gross negligence or
willful misconduct.


--- Page 62 ---

In the absence of the operator's gross negligence or willful
misconduct, other liabilities are generally borne by the joint venture
and the cost thereof is assumed by the partners of the joint venture
in proportion to their respective ownership interests.

Risks and control
Risk Factors

With respect to third-party providers of goods and services, the
amount and nature of the liability assumed by the third party
depends on the context and may be limited by contract. Contracts
may also contain obligations to indemnify TOTAL or for TOTAL to
indemnify co-contracting parties or third parties.

1.6. Risks related to political or economic factors

TOTAL has significant production and reserves located in
politically, economically and socially unstable areas, where the
likelihood of material disruption of the Group’s operations is
relatively high.

A significant portion of TOTAL's oil and gas production and reserves
is located in countries that are not part of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In recent years,
a number of these countries have experienced varying degrees of
one or more of the following: economic or political instability, civil
war, violent conflict, social unrest, actions of terrorist groups and
the application of international economic sanctions. Any of these
conditions alone or in combination could disrupt the Group's
operations in any of these regions, causing substantial declines in
production or revisions to reserves estimates.

In Africa, which represented 26%"" of the Group's 2016 combined
liquids and gas production, certain of the countries in which the
Group has production have recently suffered from some of these
conditions, including Nigeria, which is one of the main contributing
countries to the Group's production of hydrocarbons, and Libya
(refer to point 2.1.1.8 of chapter 2).

The Middle East, which represented 21% of the Group's 2016
combined liquids and gas production, has in recent years suffered
increased political volatility in connection with violent conflict and
social unrest, including Syria, where European Union (EU) and U.S.
economic sanctions have prohibited TOTAL from producing oil and
gas since 2011. In Yemen, the deterioration of security conditions in
the vicinity of Balhaf caused the company Yemen LNG, in which the
Group holds a stake of 39.62%, to stop its commercial production
and export of LNG and to declare force majeure to its various
stakeholders in 2015. The plant has been put in preservation mode.
In Iran, following the suspension on January 16, 2016 of UN
economic sanctions, most U.S. secondary sanctions and most EU
economic sanctions, the Group has engaged in certain activities.
However, sanctions could be reinstated unilaterally in the event of a
dispute over Iran's compliance with its nuclear commitments or in
certain other cases. For additional information, refer to points 1.9.1
and 1.9.2 of this chapter.

In South America, which represented 6% of the Group's 2016, combined
liquids and gas production, certain of the countries in which TOTAL
has production have recently suffered from some of the above-
mentioned conditions, including Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela.

Since July 2014, international economic sanctions have been
adopted against certain Russian persons and entities, including
various entities operating in the financial, energy and defense
sectors. As of December 31, 2016, TOTAL held nearly 21% of its
proved reserves in Russia, where from the Group had 14% of its
combined oil and gas production in 2016. For additional
information, refer to point 1.9.1 of this chapter.

(1) Excluding North Attica.
(2) Including North Africa.

Furthermore, in addition to current production, TOTAL is also
exploring for and developing new reserves in other regions of the
world that are historically characterized by political, social and
economic instability, such as the Caspian Sea region where TOTAL.
has large projects currently underway.

The occurrence and magnitude of incidents related to economic,
social and political instability are unpredictable. It is possible that
they could have a material adverse impact on the Group's
production and operations in the future and/or cause certain
investors to reduce their holdings of TOTAL’s securities.

TOTAL, like other major international energy companies, has a
geographically diverse portfolio of reserves and operational sites,
which allows it to conduct its business and financial affairs so as to
reduce its exposure to political and economic risks. However, there
can be no assurance that such events will not have a material
adverse impact on the Group.

Intervention by host country authorities can adversely affect
the Group's activities and its operating results.

TOTAL has significant exploration and production activities, and in
some cases refining, marketing or chemicals operations, in
countries whose governmental and regulatory framework is subject
to unexpected change and where the enforcement of contractual
rights is uncertain. The legal framework of TOTAL’s exploration and
production activities, established through concessions, licenses,
permits and contracts granted by or entered into with a
government entity, a state-owned company or, sometimes, private
owners, is subject to risks of renegotiation that, in certain cases,
can reduce or challenge the protections offered by the initial legal
framework and/or the economic benefit to TOTAL.

In addition, the Group’s exploration and production activities in
such countries are often undertaken in conjunction with state-
owned entities, for example as part of a joint venture in which the
state has a significant degree of control. In recent years, in various
regions globally, TOTAL has observed governments and state-
owned enterprises impose more stringent conditions on companies
pursuing exploration and production activities in their respective
countries, increasing the costs and uncertainties of the Group's
business operations. TOTAL expects this trend to continue.

Potential increasing intervention by governments in such countries
can take a wide variety of forms, including:

- the award or denial of exploration and production interests;

- the imposition of specific drilling obligations;

- price and/or production quota controls and export limits;

— nationalization or expropriation of assets;

- unilateral cancellation or modification of license or contract rights;

- increases in taxes and royalties, including retroactive claims and
changes in regulations and tax reassesments;

Registration Document 2016. TOTAL

Risks and control
Risk Factors

- the renegotiation of contracts;

- the imposition of increased local content requirements;
— payment delays; and

- currency exchange restrictions or currency devaluation.

If a host government were to intervene in one of these forms in a
country where TOTAL has substantial operations, including
exploration, the Group could incur material costs or the Group's
production or asset value could decrease, which could potentially

have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, including its
operating income and cash flow.

For example, the Nigerian government has been contemplating
new legislation to govern the petroleum industry which, if passed
into law, could have an impact on the existing and future activities
of the Group in that country through increased taxes and/or
operating costs and could adversely affect financial returns from
projects in that country.

1.7. Risks related to competition and lack of innovation

The Group operates in a highly competitive environment. Its
competitiveness could be adversely impacted if the Group's
level of innovation lagged behind its competitors.

TOTAL's main competitors are comprised of national and international
oil companies. The evolution of the energy sector has opened the
door to new competitors and increased market price volatility.

TOTAL is subject to competition in the acquisition of assets and
licenses for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas as
well as for the sale of manufactured products based on crude and
refined oil. In the gas sector, major producers increasingly compete
in the downstream value chain with established distribution
companies. Increased competitive pressure could have a significant
negative effect on the prices, margins and market shares of the
Group's companies.

The pursuit of unconventional gas development, particularly in the
United States, has contributed to falling market prices and a
marked difference between spot and long-term contract prices.
The competitiveness of long-term contracts indexed to oil prices
could be affected if this discrepancy persists and if it should prove
difficult to invoke price revision clauses.

The Group's activities are carried out in a constantly changing
environment with new products and technologies continuously
emerging. The Group may not be able to anticipate these changes,
identify and integrate technological developments in order to
maintain its competitiveness, maintain a high level of performance
and operational excellence, and best meet the needs and demands
of its customers. The Group's innovation policy requires significant
investment, notably in R&D, of which the expected impact cannot
be guaranteed.

In the field of R&D, the multiplication of research partnerships, in
particular in related technical fields, may make it difficult for the
Group to track technical information exchanged with research
partners and monitor related contractual restrictions (e.g.,
confidentiality, limited use). New and increasingly complex digital
technologies as well as the multiplication of partnerships are all
likely to increase contamination risks, which could, as a result, limit
TOTAL ability to exploit innovations.

1.8. Ethical misconduct and non-compliance risks

Ethical misconduct or breaches of applicable laws by employees
of the Group could expose TOTAL to criminal and civil penalties
and be damaging to TOTAL's reputation and shareholder value.

The Group's Code of Conduct, which applies to all of its
employees, defines TOTAL’s commitment to business integrity and
compliance with all applicable legal requirements and high ethical
standards. This commitment is supported by a “zero tolerance”
principle. Ethical misconduct (notably with respect to human rights)
or non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations (including
corruption, fraud and competition laws) by TOTAL or any third party
acting on its behalf could expose TOTAL and/or its employees to
criminal and civil penalties and could be damaging to TOTAL's
reputation and shareholder value.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016

In addition, such misconduct or non-compliance may lead the
competent authorities to impose other measures, such as the
appointment of an independent monitor in charge of assessing the
Group's compliance and internal control procedures and, if need
be, recommending improvements. For an overview of the
settlements between TOTAL, the SEC and the Department of
Justice (DoJ) providing for the appointment of an independent
monitor, refer to point 4.3 of this chapter and point 3.7 of chapter 7.

Generally, entities of the Group could potentially be subject to
administrative, judicial or arbitration proceedings that could have a
material adverse impact on the Group’s financial condition and
reputation (refer to point 2 of this chapter).

1.9. Countries targeted by economic sanctions

TOTAL has activities in certain countries targeted by economic
sanctions. If the Group’s activities are not conducted in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations, TOTAL
could be sanctioned.

Various members of the international community have targeted
certain countries, including Iran and Syria, as well as certain
economic sectors in Russia, with economic sanctions and other
restrictive measures. U.S. and European restrictions relevant to the
Group and certain disclosure concerning the Group's limited
activities or presence in certain targeted countries are outlined
below in points 1.9.1 and 1.9.2, respectively.

1.9.1. U.S. and European legal restrictions

TOTAL continues to closely monitor the possible impacts of
international economic sanctions regimes on its activities. The
Group does not believe that its activities in targeted countries are in
violation of applicable economic sanctions administered by the
United States, the European Union (“EU") and other members of
the international community. However, the Group cannot assure
that current or future regulations or developments related to
economic sanctions will not have a negative impact on its business,
financial condition or reputation. A violation by the Group of
applicable laws or regulations could result in criminal, civil and/or
material financial penalties.

Restrictions against Iran

On July 14, 2015, the EU, China, France, Russia, the United
Kingdom, the United States and Germany reached an agreement
with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the
“JCPOA"), regarding limits on Iran’s nuclear activities and relief
under certain U.S., EU and UN economic sanctions regarding Iran.
On January 16, 2016, the International Atomic Energy Agency
(“IAEA”) confirmed that Iran had met its initial nuclear compliance
commitments under the JCPOA. Therefore, as from that date, UN
economic sanctions, most U.S. secondary sanctions (.e., those
covering non-U.S. persons") and most EU economic sanctions
were suspended). Sanctions could, however, be reinstated
unilaterally by any participant in the event of a dispute over Iran's
compliance with its nuclear commitments or in certain other cases.
TOTAL is closely monitoring developments in this regard.

With respect to the Group's activities conducted under the
sanctions framework that was in place prior to the JCPOA
sanctions relief, the U.S. Department of State made a determination
on September 30, 2010 that certain historical activities would not
be deemed sanctionable and that, so long as TOTAL acts in
accordance with its commitments related to this determination, it
will not be regarded as a company of concern for its past Iran-
related activities. Since 2011, TOTAL has had no production in Iran.

Certain U.S. states have adopted legislation with respect to Iran
requiring, in certain conditions, state pension funds to divest
securities in any company with active business operations in Iran

and state contracts not to be awarded to such companies. State
regulators have adopted similar initiatives relating to investments by
insurance companies. These measures are generally still in effect
despite the JCPOA sanctions relief. If TOTAL's activities in Iran were
determined to fall within the scope of these prohibitions, and in the
absence of any available exemptions, certain U.S. institutions
holding interests in TOTAL may be required to sell their interests.

On November 8, 2016, TOTAL signed a heads of agreement
(“HOA”) with the National Iranian Oil Company (“NIOC"), which was
removed on January 16, 2016 from the U.S. and EU sanctions
designation lists. The HOA contemplates that the parties will
negotiate an agreement for the development of phase 11 of South
Pars gas field in Iran. For additional information regarding this HOA,
refer to point 1.9.2, below.

TOTAL believes that its current activities in Iran or involving Iranian
persons comply with the EU and U.S. sanctions that remain in force
in respect of Iran.

Restrictions against Syria

The EU adopted measures in 2011 regarding trade with and
investment in Syria that are applicable to European persons and to
entities constituted under the laws of an EU Member State,
including, notably, a prohibition on the purchase, import or
transportation from Syria of crude oil and petroleum products.

The United States also has adopted comprehensive measures that
broadly prohibit trade and investment in Syria. Since 2011, the
Group has ceased activities that contribute to oil and gas production
in Syria and has not purchased hydrocarbons from Syria.

Restrictions against Russia

Since July 2014, international economic sanctions have been adopted
against certain Russian persons and entities, including various
entities operating in the financial, energy and defense sectors.

The economic sanctions adopted by the EU since 2014 do not
materially affect TOTAL's activities in Russia. TOTAL has been
formally authorized by the French government, which is the
competent authority for granting authorization under the EU
sanctions regime, to continue all its activities in Russia (on the
Kharyaga and Termokarstovoye fields and the Yamal LNG project).

The United States has notably adopted economic sanctions targeting
PAO Novatek® (“Novatek"), as well as entities in which Novatek
(individually or with other similarly targeted persons or entities
collectively) owns an interest of at least 50%, including OAO Yamal
LNG® (“Yamal LNG") and Terneftegas. These sanctions prohibit
U.S. persons from transacting in, providing financing for or otherwise
dealing in debt issued by these entities after July 16, 2014 of greater
than 90 days maturity. Consequently, the use of the U.S. dollar for
such financing, including for Yamal LNG, is effectively prohibited.

The Yamal LNG project's financing was finalized in successive steps
in 2016 in compliance with applicable regulations.

(1) For purposes of this chapter, “U.S. person” means any U.S. citizen and permanent resident alien wherever they are in the world, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any

TOTAL's activities in Russia are also not materially affected by
restrictive measures adopted by the United States in August 2015
imposing export controls and restrictions relating to the export of
certain goods, services, and technologies destined for projects
located in Russia in the field of oil exploration.

As of December 31, 2016, TOTAL held nearly 21% of its proved
reserves in Russia, where from the Group had 14% of its combined
oil and gas production in 2016.

TOTAL continues to closely monitor the different international
sanctions regimes targeting certain sectors of the economy of
Russia, and in particular, it closely monitors the potential imposition
of additional sanctions.

1.9.2. Information concerning certain limited
activities in Iran and Syria

Provided in this section is certain information concerning TOTAL's
activities related to Iran that took place in 2016 that is required to
be disclosed pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (“U.S. Exchange Act"). In addition,
information for 2016 is provided concerning the various types of
payments made by Group affiliates to the government of any
country identified by the United States as a state sponsor of
terrorism (currently, Iran, Syria and Sudan") or any entity controlled
by those governments. TOTAL believes that these activities are not
sanctionable and has not been informed that it is at risk of possible
imposition of sanctions for activities previously disclosed. For more
information on certain U.S. and EU restrictions relevant to TOTAL in
these jurisdictions, see point 1.9.1 above.

Iran

The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012
(“TRA”) added Section 13(r) to the U.S. Exchange Act, which
requires TOTAL to disclose whether it or any of its affiliates has
engaged during the calendar year in certain lran-related activities,
including those targeted under ISA, without regard to whether such
activities are sanctionable under ISA, and any transaction or dealing
with the Government of Iran that is not conducted pursuant to a
specific authorization of the U.S. government. While neither TOTAL
S.A. nor any of its affiliates have engaged in any activity that would
be required to be disclosed pursuant to subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C)
of Section 13(r) (1), affiliates of the Company may be deemed to
have engaged in certain transactions or dealings with the
government of Iran that would require disclosure pursuant to
Section 13(r) (1)(D), as discussed below.

Upstream

Following the suspension of certain international economic
sanctions against Iran on January 16, 2016 (as described in point
1.9.1 of this chapter), the Group commenced various business
development activities in Iran. TOTAL entered into a memorandum
of understanding (“MOU”) with the National Iranian Oil Company
(‘NIOC"), pursuant to which NIOC provided technical data on
certain oil and gas projects so that TOTAL could assess potential
developments in Iran in compliance with the remaining applicable
international economic sanctions. TOTAL subsequently proposed
to develop and operate the South Pars Phase 11 gas field offshore
Iran in the Persian Gulf along the international border with Qatar.
This resulted in the negotiation and signing, on November 8, 2016,

of a heads of agreement (“HOA") for the development and
operation of the field. The parties to the HOA are NIOC, Total E&P
South Pars S.A.S. (a wholly owned affiliate of TOTAL S.A.), CNPC.
International Ltd. (a wholly owned affiliate of China National
Petroleum Company) and Petropars Ltd. (a wholly owned affiliate of
NIOC). The HOA contains the key principles and commercial terms
that will be adopted in a definitive contract for the development and
operation of South Pars Phase 11, should such definitive contract
be finally agreed. The project is expected to have a production
capacity of 370,000 boe/d and the produced gas will be fed into
Iran's gas network. TOTAL is expected to operate the project with a
50.1% interest alongside Petropars (19.9%) and CNPC (30%). The
required investment is expected to be approximately $4 billion, of
which TOTAL would finance 50.1%, with all equity contributions
and payments in non-U.S. currency. In preparation for the South
Pars Phase 11 project, TOTAL commenced engineering and
reservoir studies, which were presented in part to Pars Oil & Gas
Company (a NIOC affiliate) in 2016 during a technical workshop. In
the event of new or reinstated international economic sanctions, if
such sanctions were to prevent the Group from performing under
the anticipated contract for South Pars Phase 11, TOTAL expects
to be able to terminate the contract and recover its past costs from
NIOC (unless prevented by sanctions).

Regarding other potential oil and gas projects covered by the
aforementioned MOU, TOTAL held technical meetings in 2016 with
representatives of NIOC and its affiliated companies and carried out
a technical review of the South Azadegan oil field in Iran as well as
the Iran LNG Project (a project contemplating a 10 Mt/y LNG
production facility at Tombak Port on Iran's Persian Gulf coast), the
results of which were partially disclosed to NIOC and relevant
affiliated companies.

In addition, in connection with anticipated activities under the
aforementioned MOU and HOA, TOTAL attended meetings in 2016
with the Iranian oil and gas ministry and several Iranian companies
with ties to the government of Iran.

Also in 2016, TOTAL was selected, along with other international oil
and gas companies, to form an advisory group to the oil and gas
ministries of Iran and Oman concerning a possible future gas
pipeline between the two countries. In that regard, TOTAL entered
into a confidentiality agreement and attended meetings with these
companies and ministries.

In addition, TOTAL registered in 2016 a branch office of anew
entity, Total Iran B.V., a wholly-owned affiliate of TOTAL S.A., the
purpose of which is to serve as the representation office for the
Group in Iran. This entity replaces Total E&P Iran, which previously
served the same purpose, but only for Exploration & Production.

Neither revenues nor profits were recognized from any of the
aforementioned activities in 2016, and the Group expects to
conduct similar business development activities in 2017.

Some payments are yet to be reimbursed to the Group with respect
to past expenditures and remuneration under buyback contracts
entered into between 1997 and 1999 with NIOC for the
development of the South Pars 2&3 and Dorood fields. With
respect to these contracts, development operations were
completed in 2010 and the Group is no longer involved in the
operation of these fields.

(1) Since the independence of the Republic of South Sudan on July 9, 2011, TOTAL is no longer present in Sudan.

Concerning payments to Iranian entities in 2016, Total E&P Iran
(100%), Elf Petroleum Iran (99.8%), Total Sirri (100%) and Total
South Pars (99.8%) collectively made payments of approximately
IRR 8 billion (approximately $0.1 million”) to (i) the Iranian
administration for taxes and social security contributions
concerning the personnel of the aforementioned local office and
residual buyback contract-related obligations, and (ii) Iranian public
entities for payments with respect to the maintenance of the
aforementioned local office (e.g., utilities, telecommunications).
TOTAL expects similar types of payments to be made by these
affiliates in 2017 albeit in higher amounts due to increased business
development activity in Iran. Neither revenues nor profits were
recognized from the aforementioned activities in 2016.

Furthermore, Total E&P UK Limited (“TEP UK"), a wholly-owned
affiliate of TOTAL, holds a 43.25% interest in a joint venture at the
Bruce field in the UK with BP Exploration Operating Company
Limited (87.5%, operator), BHP Billiton Petroleum Great Britain Ltd
(16%) and Marubeni Oil & Gas (North Sea) Limited (3.75%). This
joint venture is party to an agreement (the “Bruce Rhum
Agreement”) governing certain transportation, processing and
operation services provided to a joint venture at the Rhum field in
the UK that is co-owned by BP (50%, operator) and the Iranian Oil
Company UK Ltd (“IOC”), a subsidiary of NIOC (50%) (together, the
“Rhum Owners”). TEP UK owned and operated the pipeline of the
Frigg UK Association and the St Fergus Gas Terminal and was
party to an agreement governing provision of transportation and
processing services to the Rhum Owners (the “Rhum FUKA
Agreement”) (the Bruce Rhum Agreement and the Rhum FUKA
Agreement being referred to collectively as the “Rhum
Agreements”). On August 27, 2015, TEP UK signed a sale and
purchase agreement to divest its entire interest in the Frigg UK
Association pipeline and St Fergus Gas Terminal to NSMP
Operations Limited (“NSMP"). On March 15, 2016, the divestment
was completed and TEP Uk’s interest in the Rhum FUKA
Agreement was novated to NSMP. As from this date, TEP UK's only
interest in the Rhum FUKA Agreement is in relation to the
settlement of historical force majeure claims with the Rhum Owners.
relating to the period when the Rhum field was shut down. To
TOTAL's knowledge, provision of all services under the Rhum
Agreements was initially suspended in November 2010, when the
Rhum field stopped production following the adoption of EU
sanctions, other than critical safety-related services (i.e., monitoring
and marine inspection of the Rhum facilities), which were permitted
by EU sanctions regulations. On October 22, 2013, the UK
government notified IOC of its decision to apply a temporary
management scheme to IOC's interest in the Rhum field within the
meaning of UK Regulations 3 and 5 of the Hydrocarbons
(Temporary Management Scheme) Regulations 2013 (the
“Hydrocarbons Regulations”). From October 22, 2013 until the
termination of the temporary management scheme on March 16,
2016 (as further explained below), all correspondence by TEP UK in
respect of IOC's interest in the Rhum Agreements was with the UK
government in its capacity as temporary manager of IOC’s
interests. On December 6, 2013, the UK government authorized
TEP UK, among others, under Article 43a of EU Regulation
267/2012, as amended by 1263/2012 and under Regulation 9 of
the Hydrocarbons Regulations, to carry out activities in relation to
the operation and production of the Rhum field. In addition, on

September 4, 2013, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a license
to BP authorizing BP and certain others to engage in various
activities relating to the operation and production of the Rhum field.
Following receipt of all necessary authorizations, the Rhum field
resumed production on October 26, 2014 with IOC's interest in the
Rhum field and the Rhum Agreements subject to the UK
government's temporary management pursuant to the
Hydrocarbons Regulations. Services were provided by TEP UK
under the Rhum Agreements from October 26, 2014 and TEP UK
received tariff income and revenues from BP and the UK
government (in its capacity as temporary manager of IOC's interest
in the Rhum field) in accordance with the terms of the Rhum
Agreements until the termination of the temporary management
scheme in March 2016. As IOC ceased to be a listed person within
the meaning of the Hydrocarbons Regulations on January 16,
2016, the UK government gave notice to IOC on January 22, 2016
of the termination of the temporary management scheme with
effect from March 16, 2016 in accordance with regulation 26(1) (a)
and 27(1)(a) of the Hydrocarbons Regulations. As a result, since
March 16, 2016, TEP UK has liaised directly with IOC concerning
its interest in the Bruce Rhum Agreement, and services have been
provided by TEP UK under the Bruce Rhum Agreement to IOC as
Rhum Owner. In 2016, these activities generated for TEP UK gross
revenue of approximately £8 million (approximately $9.8 million) and
net profit of approximately £0.20 million (approximately $0.25 million).
Subject to the foregoing, TEP UK intends to continue such activities
so long as they continue to be permissible under UK and EU law
and not be in breach of remaining applicable international economic
sanctions.

Downstream

The Group does not own or operate any refineries or chemicals
plants in Iran and did not purchase Iranian hydrocarbons when
prohibited by applicable EU and U.S. economic and financial
sanctions (refer to point 1.9.1, above).

The Group resumed its trading activities with Iran in February 2016
via its wholly-owned affiliates Totsa Total Oil Trading S.A. and Total
Trading Asia Pte Ltd. During 2016, approximately 50 Mb of crude
il from Iran were purchased for nearly €1.8 billion (nearly $1.9 billion)
pursuant to a mix of spot and term contracts. Most of this crude oil
was used to supply the Group's refineries and, therefore, it is not
possible to estimate the related gross revenue and net profit.
However, approximately 1.4 Mb of this crude oil were sold to entities
outside of the Group. In addition, in 2016 approximately 11 Mb of
petroleum products were bought from/sold to entities with ties to
the government of Iran. These operations generated gross revenue
of nearly €374 million (nearly $394 million) and net profit of
approximately €2.7 million (approximately $2.8 million). The affiliates
expect to continue these activities in 2017.

Saft Groupe S.A. (“Saft”), a wholly-owned affiliate of the Group, in
2016 sold signaling and backup battery systems for metros and
railways as well as products for the utilities and oil and gas sectors
to companies in Iran, including some having direct or indirect ties
with the Iranian government. In 2016, this activity generated gross
revenue of approximately €5.6 million (approximately $5.9 million)
and net profit of approximately €0.80 million (approximately

$0.84 million). Saft expects to continue this activity in 2017.

Saft also attended the Iran Oil Show in 2016, where it discussed
business opportunities with Iranian customers, including those with
direct or indirect ties with the Iranian government. Saft expects to
conduct similar business development activities in 2017.

Total Solar (formerly named Total Energie Développement), a
wholly-owned affiliate of the Group, had preliminary discussions in
2016 regarding the potential development of solar projects with
companies in Iran, including some having direct or indirect ties with
the Iranian government. Neither revenues nor profits were
recognized from this activity in 2016, and Total Solar expects to
continue this activity in 2017.

TOTAL S.A. signed in 2016 a non-binding memorandum of
understanding with the National Petrochemical Company, a
company owned by the government of Iran, to consider a project
for the construction in Iran of a steamcracker and polyethylene
production lines. In relation to the early stages of this project,
several visits to Iran were conducted in 2016. TOTAL S.A. recognized
no revenue or profit from this activity in 2016 and similar activities
are expected to continue in 2017.

Representatives of the companies Le Joint Frangais (a subsidiary of
Hutchinson SA) and Hutchinson SNC, wholly-owned affiliates of the
Group, conducted multiple visits to Iran in 2016 to discuss
business opportunities in the car industry sector with several
companies, including some having direct or indirect ties with the
Iranian government. These companies recognized no revenue or
profit from this activity in 2016 and expect to continue such
discussions in the future.

Hutchinson Gmbh, a wholly-owned affiliate of the Group, sold
plastic tubing for automobiles in 2016 to Ikco, an affiliate of Iran
Khodro, a company in which the government of Iran holds a 20%
interest and which is supervised by Iran's Industrial Management
Organization. In 2016, these activities generated gross revenue

of approximately €1.05 million (approximately $1.11 million) and net
profit of approximately €150,000 (approximately $158,000). This
company expects to continue this activity in 2017.

Hanwha Total Petrochemicals (“HTC”), a joint venture in which Total
Holdings UK Limited (a wholly-owned affiliate of TOTAL) holds a
50% interest and Hanwha General Chemicals holds a 50% interest,
purchased nearly 25 Mb of condensates from NIOC for
approximately KRW 1,300 billion (approximately $1,1 billion). These
condensates are used as raw material for certain of the Group's
steamcrackers. HTC expects to continue this activity in 2017.

Total Research & Technology Feluy (“TRTF”), a wholly-owned
affiliate of TOTAL, commenced in 2016 the process to file a patent
in Iran concerning metallocene technology. Related to this process,
TRIF had contacts with Iranian government officials, but no fees
were paid. TRTF expects to continue the patent filing process in 2017.

Until December 2012, at which time it sold its entire interest, the
Group held a 50% interest in the lubricants retail company Beh
Total (now named Beh Tam) along with Behran Oil (60%), a
company controlled by entities with ties to the government of Iran.
As part of the sale of the Group’s interest in Beh Tam, TOTAL S.A.
agreed to license the trademark “Total” to Beh Tam for an initial 3-
year period for the sale by Beh Tam of lubricants to domestic
consumers in Iran. In 2014, Total E&P Iran (“TEPI"), a wholly-owned
affiliate of TOTAL S.A., received, on behalf of TOTAL S.A., royalty
payments of approximately IRR 24 billion (nearly $1 million) from

Beh Tam for such license. These payments were based on Beh
Tam’s sales of lubricants during the previous calendar year. In 2015,
royalty payments were suspended due to a procedure brought by
the Iranian tax authorities against TEPI. At the end of 2016, this
procedure was still pending and no royalty payments had been
received since 2015. Representatives of Total Outre Mer, a wholly-
owned affiliate of the Group, made several visits to Beh Tam and
Behran Oil during 2016 regarding the possible purchase of shares
of Beh Tam. Subsequent to an internal reorganization, the matter
was transferred to Total Oil Asia-Pacific Ltd, another wholly-owned
affiliate of the Group, which had several exchanges with
representatives of Behran Oil. As of the end of 2016, no agreement
had been reached, no money was paid or received by either
company. Similar discussions may take place in the future.

Total Marketing Middle East FZE (“TMME"), a wholly-owned affiliate
of the Group, sold lubricants to Beh Tam in 2016. The sale in 2016
of approximately 54 t of lubricants and special fluids generated
gross revenue of approximately AED 420,000 (approximately
$114,000) and net profit of approximately AED 360,000 (approximately
$98,000). TMME expects to continue this activity in 2017.

Total Marketing France (“TMF”), a company wholly-owned by Total
Marketing & Services ("TMS"), itself a company wholly-owned by
TOTAL S.A. and six Group employees, provided in 2016 fuel
payment cards to the Iranian embassy in France for use in the Group's
service stations. In 2016, these activities generated gross revenue
of nearly €22,000 (approximately $23,000) and net profit of nearly
€900 (nearly $950). TMF expects to continue this activity in 2017.

TMF also sold jet fuel in 2016 to Iran Air as part of its airplane
refueling activities at Paris Orly airport in France. The sale of
approximately 2.8 million liters of jet fuel generated gross revenue of
approximately €982,000 (approximately $1.03 million) and net profit
of approximately €10,000 (approximately $11,000). TMF expects

to continue this activity in 2017.

Air Total International (“ATI”), a wholly-owned affiliate of the Group,
on two occasions in 2016 sold jet fuel to a broker based at Le
Bourget airport near Paris that was destined for the refueling of an
Iranian government airplane (official presidential/ministerial visits).
These sales generated gross revenue of approximately €8,000
(approximately $8,400) and net profit of approximately €1,600
(approximately $1,700). ATI may conduct similar activities in 2017.

Total Belgium (“TB”), a company wholly-owned by the Group,
provided in 2016 fuel payment cards to the Iranian embassy in
Brussels (Belgium) for use in the Group's service stations. In 2016,
these activities generated gross revenue of approximately €1,500
(approximately $1,600) and net profit of approximately €300
(approximately $320). TB expects to continue this activity in 2017.

Proxifuel, a company wholly-owned by the Group, sold in 2016
heating oil to the Iranian embassy in Brussels. In 2016, these activities
generated gross revenue of approximately €200 (approximately $210)
and net profit of approximately €80 (approximately $85). Proxifuel
expects to continue this activity in 2017.

Caldeo, a company wholly-owned by TMS, sold in 2016
approximately 3 m$ of domestic heating oil to the Iranian embassy
in France, which generated gross revenue of nearly €435 (nearly

Syria

Since early December 2011, TOTAL has ceased its activities that
contribute to oil and gas production in Syria and maintains a local
office solely for non-operational functions. In late 2014, the Group
initiated a downsizing of its Damascus office and reduced its staff
to a few employees. In 2016, TOTAL made payments of nearly SYP
500,000 (approximately $2,300) to Syrian government agencies in the
form of taxes and contributions for public services rendered in relation
to the maintenance of the aforementioned office and its personnel.

There are no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings,
including any proceeding of which the Company is aware that are
pending or threatened against the Company, that could have, or
could have had during the last 12 months, a material impact on the
Group's financial situation or profitability.

Described below are the main administrative, legal and arbitration
proceedings in which the Company and the other entities of the
Group are involved.

Alitalia

In the Marketing & Services segment, a civil proceeding was initiated
in Italy, in 2013, against TOTAL S.A. and its subsidiary Total Aviazione
Italia Srl before the competent Italian civil court. The plaintiff claims
against TOTAL S.A., its subsidiary and other third parties, damages
that it estimates to be nearly €908 million. This proceeding follows
practices that had been condemned by the Italian competition
authority in 2006. The parties have exchanged preliminary findings.
The existence and the assessment of the alleged damages in this
procedure involving multiple defendants remain contested.

Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic Committee —

Russian regions and Interneft

Blue Rapid, a Panamanian company, and the Russian Olympic
Committee filed a claim for damages with the Paris Commercial
Court against Elf Aquitaine, alleging a so-called non-completion by
a former subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine of a contract related to an
exploration and production project in Russia negotiated in the early
1990s. Elf Aquitaine believed this claim to be unfounded and
opposed it. On January 12, 2009, the Commercial Court of Paris
rejected Blue Rapid's claim against Elf Aquitaine and found that the
Russian Olympic Committee did not have standing in the matter.
On June 30, 2011, the Court of Appeal of Paris dismissed as
inadmissible the claim of Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic
Committee against Elf Aquitaine, notably on the grounds of the
contract having lapsed. The judgment of the Court of Appeal of
Paris is now final and binding following two decisions issued on
February 18, 2016 by the French Supreme Court to put an end to
this proceeding.

In connection with the same facts, and 15 years after the
aforementioned exploration and production contract was rendered
null and void (“caduc”), a Russian company, which was held not to
be the contracting party to the contract, and two regions of the
Russian Federation that were not even parties to the contract,
launched an arbitration procedure against the aforementioned

former subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine that was liquidated in 2005,
claiming alleged damages of $22.4 billion. For the same reasons as
those successfully adjudicated by Elf Aquitaine against Blue Rapid
and the Russian Olympic Committee, the Group considers this
claim to be unfounded as a matter of law and fact.

The Group has lodged a criminal complaint to denounce the
fraudulent claim of which the Group believes it is a victim and, has
taken and reserved its rights to take all actions and measures to
defend its interests.

FERC

The Office of Enforcement of the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) began in 2015 an investigation in connection
with the natural gas trading activities in the United States of Total
Gas & Power North America, Inc. (TGPNA), a U.S. subsidiary of the
Group. The investigation covered transactions made by TGPNA
between June 2009 and June 2012 on the natural gas market.
TGPNA received a Notice of Alleged Violations from FERC on
September 21, 2015. On April 28, 2016, FERC issued an order to
show cause to TGPNA and two of its former employees, and to
TOTAL S.A. and Total Gas & Power Ltd., regarding the same facts.
A class action has been launched to seek damages from these
three companies.

TGPNA has cooperated in the investigation with the U.S. authorities
and contests the claims brought against it.

Grande Paroisse

On September 21, 2001, an explosion occurred at the industrial
site of Grande Paroisse (a former subsidiary of Atofina which
became a subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine Fertilisants on December 31,
2004), in a stockpile of ammonium nitrate pellets. The explosion
caused the death of thirty-one people, including twenty-one
workers at the site, injured many others and caused significant
damage on the site and to property in the city of Toulouse.

Grande Paroisse donated the former site of the plant to the greater
agglomeration of Toulouse. A €10 million endowment was also
granted to the InNaBioSanté research foundation as part of the
setting up of a cancer research center at the site.

After many years, the investigating magistrate brought charges
against Grande Paroisse and the former Plant Manager before the
Toulouse Criminal Court. TOTAL S.A. and the CEO at the time of
the event were summoned to appear in Court pursuant to a request
by a victims association.

On November 19, 2009, the Toulouse Criminal Court acquitted
both the former Plant Manager and Grande Paroisse due to the
lack of reliable evidence for the explosion. The Court declared
Grande Paroisse civilly liable for the damages caused by the
explosion to the victims in its capacity as custodian and operator of
the plant. The Court also ruled that the summonses were
inadmissible.

On September 24, 2012, the Court of Appeal convicted the former
Plant Manager and Grande Paroisse. The summonses were
determined to be inadmissible.

On January 13, 2015, the French Supreme Court (Cour de
cassation) fully quashed the decision of September 24, 2012. The
French Supreme Court ruled that the Court of Appeal impartiality
was questionable and that the application of the law on which the
conviction was partially based was improper. The case has been
referred back to the Court of Appeal of Paris for a new criminal trial,
which began in January 2017.

A compensation mechanism for victims was set up immediately
following the explosion. €2.3 billion was paid for the compensation
of claims and related expenses amounts. A €4.7 million reserve
remains booked in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements
as of December 31, 2016.

Iran

In 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) followed
by the Department of Justice (DoJ) issued a formal order directing
an investigation against TOTAL, and others oil companies, for
alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and
the Company’s accounting obligations in connection with the
pursuit of business in Iran in the 1990s.

In late May 2013, and after several years of discussions, TOTAL
reached settlements with the U.S. authorities (a Deferred
Prosecution Agreement with the DoJ and a Cease and Desist Order
with the SEC). These settlements, which put an end to these
investigations, were concluded without admission of guilt and in
exchange for TOTAL respecting a number of obligations, including
the payment of a fine and civil compensation for an aggregate
amount of $398.2 million. By virtue of these settlements, TOTAL
also accepted the appointment of an independent compliance
monitor to review the Group's compliance program and to
recommend possible improvements.

In July 2016, the monitor submitted his third and final report, in
which he certified that TOTAL had devised and implemented an
appropriate compliance program. As a result of this certification, the
U.S. authorities, after having reviewed the monitor's report,

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016

concluded that TOTAL had fulfilled all of its obligations, thus
bringing an end to the monitoring process. As a result, a court in
the State of Virginia granted a motion to dismiss on November 9,
2016, thereby terminating the procedure directed at the Company,
which can no longer be pursued in the United States for these
same facts.

With respect to the same facts, TOTAL was placed under formal
investigation in France in 2012. In October 2014, the investigating
magistrate decided to refer the case to trial.

Italy

As part of an investigation led by the Public Prosecutor of the
Potenza Court in 2007, Total Italia and also certain Group
employees were the subjects of an investigation related to alleged
irregularities in connection with the purchase of lands and the
award of calls for tenders in relation to the preparation and
development of an oil field located in the south of Italy.

Pursuant to a judgment issued on April 4, 2016, the Potenza
Criminal Court found four employees to be guilty of corruption, with
two of these employees also being found guilty of misappropriation
in connection with the purchase of land. The procedure with
respect to Total Italia was sent back to the public prosecutor due to
the imprecision of the terms of prosecution. The four employees.
decided to challenge the judgment before the Court of Appeal.

Oil-for-Food Program

Several countries have launched investigations concerning possible
violations of the UN resolutions relating to the Iraqi Oil-for-Food
Program implemented as from 1996.

Pursuant to a French criminal investigation, certain current or
former Group employees were placed under formal criminal
investigation for possible charges as aiding and abetting the
misappropriation of corporate assets and/or as aiding and abetting
the corruption of foreign public agents. In 2010, TOTAL S.A. was.
indicted on bribery charges as well as aiding and abetting and
concealing the influence peddling.

On July 8, 2013, TOTAL S.A. and the persons who were
prosecuted were cleared of all charges by the Paris Criminal Court,
which found that none of the offenses for which they had been
prosecuted was established. The Prosecutor's office appealed the
parts of the Criminal Court's decision acquitting TOTAL S.A. for
corruption of foreign public agents. On February 26, 2016, the
Court of Appeal of Paris overturned the Criminal Court’s decision
and TOTAL S.A. was convicted and ordered to pay a fine

of €750,000. The Company has decided to appeal this decision
before the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation).

Risks and control
Insurance and risk management

38. Insurance and risk management

3.1. Organization

TOTAL has its own reinsurance company, Omnium Reinsurance
Company (ORC). ORC is integrated within the Group's insurance
management and is used as a centralized global operations tool for
covering the Group companies’ insurable risks. It allows the
Group's worldwide insurance program to be implemented in
compliance with the specific requirements of local regulations
applicable in the countries where the Group operates.

Some countries may require the purchase of insurance from a local
insurance company. If the local insurer accepts to cover the
subsidiary of the Group in compliance with its worldwide insurance
program, ORC negotiates a retrocession of the covered risks from
the local insurer. As a result, ORC enters into reinsurance contracts
with the subsidiaries’ local insurance companies, which transfer
most of the risk to ORC.

At the same time, ORC negotiates a reinsurance program at the
Group level with oil industry mutual insurance companies and
commercial reinsurance markets. ORC allows the Group to better
manage price variations in the insurance market by taking on a
greater or lesser amount of risk corresponding to the price trends in
the insurance market.

In 2016, the net amount of risk retained by ORC after reinsurance
was, on the one hand, a maximum of $70 million per onshore or
offshore third-party liability insurance claim and, on the other

hand, $75 million per property damage and/or business interruption
insurance claim. Accordingly, in the event of any loss giving rise to
an aggregate insurance claim, the effect on ORC would be limited
to its maximum retention of $145 million per occurrence.

3.2. Risk and insurance management policy

In this context, the Group risk and insurance management policy is
to work with the relevant internal department of each subsidiary to:

- define scenarios of major disaster risks (estimated maximum loss);
— assess the potential financial impact on the Group should a
catastrophic event occur;

3.3. Insurance policy

- help implement measures to limit the probability that a
catastrophic event occurs and the financial consequences if such
event should occur; and

— manage the level of financial risk from such events to be either
covered internally by the Group or transferred to the insurance
market.

The Group has worldwide property insurance and third-party liability
coverage for all its subsidiaries. These programs are contracted
with first-class insurers (or reinsurers and oil and gas industry
mutual insurance companies through ORC).

The amounts insured depend on the financial risks defined in the
disaster scenarios and the coverage terms offered by the market
(available capacities and price conditions).

More specifically for:

— third-party liability: since the maximum financial risk cannot be
evaluated by a systematic approach, the amounts insured are
based on market conditions and oil and gas industry practice. In
2016, the Group's third-party liability insurance for any liability
(including potential accidental environmental liabilities) was
capped at $900 million (onshore) and $850 million (offshore). In
addition, the Group adopts, where appropriate, the necessary
means to manage the compensation of victims in the event of an
industrial accident for which it is liable; and

— property damage and business interruption: the amounts insured
vary by sector and by site and are based on the estimated cost
and scenarios of reconstruction under maximum loss situations
and on insurance market conditions. The Group subscribed for
business interruption coverage in 2016 for its main refining and
petrochemical sites.

For example, for the Group's highest risks (North Sea platforms and
main refineries or petrochemical plants), in 2016 the insurance limit
for the Group share of the installations was approximately $1.75
billion for the Refining & Chemicals segment and

approximately $2.15 billion for the Upstream segment.

Deductibles for property damage and third-party liability fluctuate
between €0.1 and €10 million depending on the level of risk and
liability, and are borne by the relevant subsidiaries. For business
interruption, coverage is triggered 60 days after the occurrence
giving rise to the interruption. In addition, the main refineries and
petrochemical plants bear a combined retention for property
damage and business interruption of $75 million per insurance
claim.

Other insurance contracts are bought by the Group in addition to
property damage and third-party liability coverage, mainly in
connection with car fleets, credit insurance and employee benefits.
These risks are mostly underwritten by outside insurance
companies.

The above-described policy is given as an example of a situation as
of a given date and cannot be considered as representative of
future conditions. The Group's insurance policy may be changed at
any time depending on the market conditions, specific
circumstances and on General Management's assessment of the
risks incurred and the adequacy of their coverage.

Risks and control
Internal control and risk management procedures

TOTAL believes that its insurance coverage is in line with industry
practice and sufficient to cover normal risks in its operations.
However, the Group is not insured against all potential risks. In the
event of a major environmental disaster, for example, TOTAL's
liability may exceed the maximum coverage provided by its third-
party liability insurance. The loss TOTAL could suffer in the event of
such disaster would depend on all the facts and circumstances of
the event and would be subject to a whole range of uncertainties,

including legal uncertainty as to the scope of liability for
consequential damages, which may include economic damage not
directly connected to the disaster. The Group cannot guarantee
that it will not suffer any uninsured loss and there can be no
guarantee, particularly in the event of a major environmental
disaster or industrial accident, that such loss would not have a
material adverse effect on the Group.

The information contained in the Report of the Chairman of the
Board of Directors was prepared with the assistance of several of
the Company’s functional departments, including in particular the
Legal, Finance and Audit & Internal Control Divisions. After the
sections relevant to their respective duties were reviewed by the
Governance and Ethics Committee, the Compensation Committee
and the Audit Committee, the information was approved by the
Board of Directors.

The Group is structured around business segments to which the
Group's operational entities report. The business segments’
management are responsible, within their area of responsibility, for
ensuring that operations are carried out in accordance with the
strategic objectives defined by the Board of Directors and General
Management. The functional departments at the Holding level help
General Management define norms and standards, oversee their
application and monitor activities. They also lend their expertise to
the operational divisions.

The Group's internal control and risk management systems are
structured around this three-level organization — Holding level,
business segments, operational entities - where each level is
directly involved and accountable in line with the level of delegation
determined by General Management.

General Management constantly strives to maintain an efficient
internal control system across the Group, based on the framework
of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). In this framework, internal control is a
process intended to provide reasonable assurance that the
objectives related to operations, reporting and compliance with
applicable laws and regulations are achieved. As for any internal
control system, it cannot provide an absolute guarantee that all
risks are completely controlled or eliminated. The COSO framework
is considered equivalent to the reference framework of the French
Financial Markets Authority (Autorité des marchés financiers). The
Group has also chosen to rely on this framework as part of its
obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016

The Group's internal control and risk management systems are
therefore based on the five components of this framework: control
environment, risk assessment, control activities, monitoring and
information, and communication.

The Group's risk management system draws on the main
international standards (COSO Enterprise Risk Management
integrated framework, ISO 31000: 2009 — Risk management) as
well as on French standards (Reference framework of the French
Financial Markets Authority). The internal Risk Management,
Internal Control and Audit Charter forms the common framework
on which the Group relies to ensure control of its activities.

The Group's internal control and risk management systems cover
the processes of the fully consolidated entities and the most
important equity affiliates.

Under these internal control principles, which are part of the corporate
governance organization, the Audit Committee is responsible for
monitoring the efficiency of internal control and risk management
systems, assisted by the Corporate Audit & Internal Control Division
and the internal control teams from the business segments. These
rules are particularly designed to allow the Board of Directors to
ensure that internal control is effective and that published information
available to shareholders and financial markets is reliable.

Approximately 400 employees monitor the internal control systems
within the Group. The assessment of the internal control and risk
management system is mainly overseen by the Corporate

Audit & Internal Control Division, which employed 77 people in

2016 and carried out more than 165 internal audits.

4.2. Control environment

Risks and control
Internal control and risk management procedures

TOTAL's control environment is based primarily on its Code of
Conduct, which, in addition to safety, sets forth its core values
(respect, responsibility and exemplary conduct) and business
principles in terms of safety, security, health, protection of the
environment, integrity and respect for human rights. This Code
of Conduct builds trust between TOTAL and both its employees
and stakeholders.

Integrity and ethics

The Group's values and business principles are set out in its Code
of Conduct (revised in 2014), its Business Integrity Guide and its
Human Rights Guide (revised in 2015). These documents are
distributed to all employees and are available on the intranet. They
also set out the rules of individual behavior expected of all
employees in the countries where the Group has a presence. The
Group has pledged its adherence to recognized international
standards related to human rights and, in particular, the core
conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the
voluntary principles on security and human rights and the United
Nations guiding principles on business and human rights.

The Financial Code of Ethics, which also refers to the Code of
Conduct, sets forth specific rules for the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Vice President of
the Corporate Accounting Division and the financial and accounting
officers of the principal Group activities.

As a priority of General Management, the Group deploys ethics and
compliance policies and programs, including in particular programs
for the prevention of corruption, fraud and competition law
infringement. These include awareness and training activities as
well as compliance audits and ethical assessments (refer to point
3.7 of chapter 7). The Group also relies on the Ethics Committee,
the role of which is to listen and provide assistance in these areas.

The relationship between the Group and its service providers is also
based on adherence to the principles set forth in the Code of
Conduct and on the Fundamental Principles of Purchasing attached
to contracts. Suppliers and service providers are required to apply
standards equivalent to those of the Group, particularly with respect
to their employees, and to make every effort to encourage their
own suppliers and subcontractors in turn to respect these principles
(for further information about relations between the Group and its
suppliers, refer to point 3.6 of chapter 7).

Structure, authority and responsibility

General Management ensures that the organizational structure and
reporting lines plan, execute, control and periodically assess the
Group's activities. General Management regularly reviews the
relevance of the organizational structures so as to be able to adapt
them quickly to changes in the activities and in the environment in
which they are carried out.

The Group has also defined central responsibilities that cover the
three lines of defense of internal control: (1) operational
management, which is responsible for implementing internal
control, (2) support functions (such as Finance, Legal, Human
Resources, etc.), which prescribe the internal control systems,
verify their implementation and effectiveness and assist operational

employees, and (3) internal auditors who, through their internal
control reports, provide recommendations to improve the
effectiveness of the system.

In addition, an accountability system is defined and formalized at all
levels of the organization, through organization notes, organization
charts, appointment notes, job descriptions and delegations of
powers. Each business segment has established clear rules applicable
to its specific scope by directly integrating the Group's instructions.

Policies and procedures

TOTAL incorporates the values, fundamental principles, strategic
options and respective requirements of the businesses, at all levels
of the organization, into a normative framework, supplemented by a
set of practical recommendations and feedback. Like the Group's
organization, this framework has a three-level structure: a Group
level, with the REFLEX Group framework and the technical
framework set out by the Corporate Technology Group,
frameworks for each business segment; and a specific framework
for each significant operational entity.

A document known as the governance framework details the
relationship between these frameworks and describes their
respective scope, the way in which the standards differ from one
another (by adaptation, clarification or stricter requirements relative
to higher level standards), exemption processes, if any, standards
development processes and the monitoring system put in place.

The main procedures regarding financial controls established at the
corporate level cover acquisitions and sales, capital expenditure,
financing and cash management, budget control and financial
reporting. Disclosure controls and procedures are in place (refer to
point 4.3.2 below). At the operating levels, these procedures mainly
pertain to directives, rules and recommendations regarding health,
safety, industrial safety, IT security and the environment, as well as
integrity and fraud and corruption prevention.

These documents, all of which are published on the Group's
intranet, are reviewed regularly and their implementation is monitored.

At the business segment or operational entity levels, control
activities are organized around the main operational processes:
exploration and reserves, procurement, capital expenditure,
production, sales, oil and gas trading, inventories, human resources,
financing and cash management, and account closing process.

Commitment to competence

The Group's human resources policy sets out rules and practices
that reflect its commitment in terms of social responsibility and its
expectations of employees, particularly in terms of competencies.
Descriptions of jobs within the Group's various entities define the
competencies and expertise required for employees to carry out
their functions effectively.

In addition, the Human Resources function shapes and regularly
updates policies aimed at attracting new talents, including
employee training, assessment and retention policies (annual
appraisals, training programs, compensation policies and career
management - refer to point 1 of chapter 7).

Risks and control
Internal control and risk management procedures

Accountability

The Board of Directors, with the support of the Audit Committee,
ensures that the internal control functions are operating properly.
The Audit Committee ensures that General Management implements
internal control and risk management procedures based on the
risks identified, such that the Group's objectives are achieved.

The general managements of the business segments and
operational entities are responsible for designing and deploying
specific components of this internal control and risk management
system within their area of responsibility. A representation letter
process deployed at the various levels of the organization reinforces
the effectiveness of the internal control system, particularly over
financial reporting.

The Internal Control Department has pursued a process aimed at
strengthening the assessment of the role and involvement of all
employees in terms of internal control. Training initiatives tailored to
the various stakeholders involved in the internal control process are
regularly launched within the Group. In 2016, an internal control
seminar brought together over 100 Group employees in addition to
online participants.

Control activities and assessment

The Group regularly examines and assesses the design and
effectiveness of the key operational, financial and information
technology controls related to internal control over financial
reporting, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In
2016, this assessment was performed with the assistance of the
Group's main entities and the Corporate Audit & Internal Control
Division. The system used covers:

- the most significant entities, which assess the key operational
controls of their significant processes and respond to a Group
questionnaire for assessing the internal control system; and

- other less significant entities, which respond only to the Group
questionnaire for assessing the internal control system.

4.3. Risk assessment and management

These two categories of entities account for approximately 80%
and 10%, respectively, of the financial aggregates in the Group’s
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, any activity, process or management system may be
the subject of an internal audit conducted by Group Audit, in
accordance with the international internal audit framework and its
Code of Ethics. The Corporate Audit & Internal Control Division also
conducts joint audits with third-party auditors and provides
assistance (advice, analysis, input regarding methodology). The
audit plan, which is based on an analysis of the risks and risk
management systems, is submitted annually to the Executive
Committee and the Audit Committee for approval. The statutory
auditors also review the internal controls that they deem necessary
as part of their certification of the financial statements. In 2016, they
reviewed the implementation of the Group's internal control
framework and the design and effectiveness of key internal controls
at its main entities regarding financial reporting. Based on their
review, the statutory auditors stated that they had no remarks on
the information and statements presented in this present Report of
the Chairman of the Board of Directors on internal control and risk
management procedures.

The reports on the work performed by the Group Audit and
statutory auditors are periodically summarized and presented

to the Audit Committee and, thereby, to the Board of Directors.
The Senior Vice President, Audit & Internal Control attended all
Audit Committee meetings held in 2016. The Audit Committee also
interviews the statutory auditors at least once a year without any
Company representatives present.

If areas of improvement are identified by these internal audits and
operational controls, then corrective action plans are drawn up and
shared with operational management, who along with the
Corporate Audit & Internal Control Division, monitor them closely.

Based on the internal reviews, General Management has reasonable
assurance of the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.

To implement its strategy, General Management ensures that clear
and precise objectives are defined at the various levels of the
organization with regard to operations, reporting and compliance.

Operational objectives focus on the definition and efficient use of
human, financial and technical resources. In particular, they are
defined during the budgetary processes and in the long-term plan,
and are regularly monitored as part of the self-assessment process.

The monitoring of operational objectives (financial and non-financial)
helps in decision-making and monitoring performance of activities
at each level of the organization.

TOTAL has set up an ongoing process to identify and analyze risks
that may affect its employees, assets and environment, and
preclude the achievement of its objectives. The Group takes into
account risks at all levels of the organization and in all its entities,
and examines factors that influence the severity, probability of
occurrence of risks or the loss of its assets and the potential impact
on operations, reporting (financial and non-financial) and
compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016

The Group has developed a control framework in line with the risk
assessments performed and implements initiatives necessary for
addressing specific risks by enforcing Group-wide rules. These
initiatives must reduce the probability of occurrence of risks and
their possible impact. They also cover the main processes
outsourced via subcontracting agreements.

TOTAL also identifies changes that could have a significant impact
on its internal control system, particularly changes related to assets
consolidated by the business segments. To this end, the Group
relies on governance bodies adapted to its various activities and
capable of making and implementing decisions necessary for quickly
responding to material changes that the Group must deal with.

The risk-mapping activities carried out by the Group's entities as
part of a regular risk assessment process help identify and analyze
key ongoing or foreseeable changes.


--- Page 74 ---

4.3.1. Monitoring of risk management systems

The Executive Committee, with the assistance of the Group Risk
Management Committee created in 2011, is responsible for
identifying and analyzing internal and external risks that could
impact TOTAL's performance. The main responsibilities of the
Group Risk Management Committee include ensuring that the
Group has an up-to-date map of the risks to which it is exposed
and that efficient risk management systems are in place.

The Group Risk Management Committee relies on the work carried
out by the business segments and functional departments, which
concurrently establish their own risk mapping. These maps are
drawn up according to a methodological framework developed by
the Group. The activities of the Group Risk Management Committee,
the major risks identified by the Group and the risk mappings of the
business segments are regularly reported to the Audit Committee.

The Group's business segments and entities are responsible for
defining and implementing a risk management policy suited to their
specific activities. However, the handling of certain transverse risks
is more closely coordinated by the respective functional departments.

General Management exercises operational control over TOTAL’s
activities through the Executive Committee's approval of
investments and commitments for projects based on defined
thresholds. The Risk Committee (CORISK) is tasked with reviewing
these projects in advance and informing the Executive Committee
of its findings. As part of this review, the CORISK verifies the
analysis of the various project-related risks.

The Group strives to implement effective control systems for the
main risks identified.

Financial risks

The management and conditions procedures for using financial
instruments are governed by strict rules that are defined by the
Group's General Management, and which provide for centralization
by the Treasury Division of liquidity, interest exchange rate positions,
management of financial instruments and access to capital markets.

The Group's financing policy consists of incurring long-term debt at
a floating rate or at a fixed rate depending on interest rates. Debt is
mainly incurred in dollars or euros according to the Group’s general
corporate needs.

The Group's cash balances, which mainly consist of dollars and
euros, are managed to maintain liquidity based on daily interest
rates in the given currency. Maximum amounts are set for
transactions exceeding one month, with placements not to exceed
12 months. TOTAL S.A. also has confirmed credit facilities granted
by international banks. These credit facilities, along with the Group’s
net cash position, allow it to continually maintain a high level of
liquidity in accordance with targets set by General Management.

In terms of counterparty risk in financial transactions, the Group
adheres to a cautious policy, and only makes commitments with
institutions featuring a high degree of financial soundness, as based
on a multi-criteria analysis. An overall credit limit is set for each
authorized financial counterparty and allocated among the Group's
subsidiaries. In addition, to reduce market value risk on its
commitments, the Treasury Division has entered into margin call
contracts with its significant counterparties.

The Group seeks to minimize its currency exposure, on the one
hand by financing its long-term assets in the functional currency of
the entity to which they belong and, on the other hand, by
systematically hedging the currency exposure generated by

Risks and control

commercial activity. These risks are managed centrally by the
Treasury Department, which operates within a set of limits defined
by General Management.

The policy for managing risks related to financing and cash
management activities as well as the Group’s currency exposure
and interest rate risks is described in detail in Note 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements (point 7 of chapter 10).

Industrial and environmental risks and risks related
to climate issues

The Group has developed a Safety Health Environment Quality
Charter that sets out the basic principles applicable to the
protection of people, property and the environment and also covers
the aspects of safety and health (H3SEQ). This Charter is
implemented at several levels within the Group through its
management systems.

Along these lines, TOTAL implements management systems such
as the internal management system MAESTRO, which meets all of
the requirements of the standards ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and
OHSAS 18001, as well as the future ISO 45001. The Group
performs regular assessments, following various procedures, of the
risks and impacts of its activities in the areas of industrial safety
(particularly process safety), the environment and the protection of
workers and local residents:

- prior to approving new investment, acquisition and
disposal projects;

- during operations (safety studies, environmental impact
assessments, health impact studies); and

— prior to releasing new substances on the market (toxicological
and ecotoxicological studies and life cycle analyses).

These assessments incorporate the regulatory requirements of the
countries where the Group's activities are carried out and generally
accepted professional practices.

In countries where prior administrative authorization and supervision
is required, projects are not undertaken without the authorization of
the relevant authorities based on the studies provided to them.

In particular, TOTAL has developed a common methodology for
analyzing technological risks that is being gradually applied to all
activities carried out by the companies of the Group (refer to point
2.2.2 of chapter 7). TOTAL develops risk management measures
based on risk and impact assessments. These measures involve
facility and structure design, the reinforcement of safety devices
and environmental remediation.

In addition to developing management systems as described
above, the Group strives to minimize industrial, safety and
environmental risks inherent in its operations by conducting
thorough inspections and audits, training personnel and raising
awareness among all those involved.

In addition, performance indicators (particularly in the areas of HSE)
and risk monitoring have been put in place, objectives have been
set and action plans have been implemented to achieve these
objectives (refer to point 2 of chapter 7).

Although the emphasis is on preventing risks, TOTAL takes regular
steps to prepare for crisis management based on identified risk
scenarios. The Group has a crisis management process that relies
on a permanent on-call system, regular drills, training courses in
crisis management and a set of tools. The organization set up in
the event of a crisis is deployed at two closely coordinated levels:

Registration Document 2016. TOTAL

Risks and control
Internal control and risk management procedures

- at the local level (country, site or entities), a crisis unit is
responsible for ensuring operational management and
implementing emergency plans; and

- at the head office level, a crisis unit consisting of a
multidisciplinary team is tasked with assessing the situation and
overseeing crisis management. This central unit provides the
necessary expertise and mobilizes additional resources to assist
the local crisis unit when necessary and intervene directly when
the situation cannot be handled locally.

Concerning the area of security, the Group has put in place the means
to monitor and analyze threats and risks at a central level in order to
anticipate and take all necessary preventive measures so as to

diminish its exposure to security risks in the countries where it operates.

In addition, TOTAL has developed emergency plans and
procedures to respond to an oil spill or leak. These plans and
procedures are specific to each subsidiary and adapted to its
organization, activities and environment, and are consistent with the
Group's anti-pollution plan. They are reviewed regularly and tested
through drills (refer to point 2.2.3 of chapter 7).

At the Group level, TOTAL has set up an organization structured
around the Plan to Mobilize Resources Against Pollution
(PARAPOL) alert scheme to facilitate crisis management and
provide assistance regardless of geographical restrictions in the
event of pollution of marine, coastal or inland waters. Its main
objective is to facilitate access to internal and external experts and
physical response resources (FOST, Cedre, OSRL).

With regard to risks related to climate issues, TOTAL is committed
to managing its energy consumption and develops processes to
improve its energy performance and that of its customers, in
accordance with its Safety Health Environment Quality Charter.

In its decision-making process, the risks and associated climate
issues (flaring, greenhouse gas emissions, CO, price sensitivity) are
assessed prior to the presentation of the projects to the Executive
Committee.

In order to ensure the viability of its projects and long-term strategy
in light of the challenges raised by climate change, the Group
integrates, into the financial evaluation of investments presented to
the Executive Committee, either a long-term CO, price of $30

to $40 per ton (depending on the price of crude), or the actual price
of CO, in a given country if higher. The Group performs sensitivity
tests to assess the ability of its asset portfolio to withstand an
increase in the price per ton of CO,.

In addition, TOTAL takes into account the 2°C scenario of the
International Agency for Energy (IAE) in its analysis of changes in
energy markets (notably that of hydrocarbons) and its development
strategy. As a result, the Group is prioritizing its projects and
focusing on hydrocarbon assets with moderate production

and processing costs that meet the highest environmental

and safety standards.

Finally, the Group assesses the vulnerability of its facilities to
climatic events so that their consequences do not affect the
integrity of the facilities or the safety of individuals. More generally,
natural hazards (climate-related risks as well as seismic, tsunami,
soil strength and other risks) are taken into account in the
conception of industrial facilities, which are designed to withstand
both normal and extreme conditions. The Group carries out a
systematic assessment of the possible repercussions of climate

TOTAL. Registration Document 2016

change on its future projects. These analyses include a review by
type of risk (e.g., sea level, storms, temperature, permafrost) and
take into account the life span of the projects and their capacity to
gradually adapt. These studies have not identified any facilities that
cannot withstand the consequences of climate change known today.

Risks related to information systems

TOTAL's IT Department has developed and distributed governance
and security rules that describe the recommended infrastructure,
organization and procedures in order to maintain information
systems that are appropriate to the organization's needs and the
risks associated with information systems and their data. These
rules are implemented across the Group under the responsibility of
the various business segments.

The Group has also developed control activities at various levels of
the organization relating to areas where information systems cover
all or part of the processes. Information Technology General
Controls aim to guarantee that information systems function and
are available as required, and that data integrity is guaranteed and
changes controlled.

Information Technology Automated Controls aim to ensure the
integrity of data generated or supported by business applications,
particularly those that impact financial flows.

The outsourcing of some components of the Group's IT
infrastructure to service providers poses specific risks and requires
the selection and development of additional controls of the
completeness, accuracy and validity of the information supplied
and received from such service providers. Accordingly, to ensure
continuous improvement, the Group assesses whether suitable
controls are implemented by the service providers concerned and
what controls are necessary within its own organization to maintain
these risks at an acceptable level.

In addition, in light of increasing legal risks (such as document
retention, personal data protection or copyright) and security risks
(such as loss of information, external and internal threats or fraud),
the Group deploys information protection, document retention and
personal data protection policies. In order to reduce these risks, the
Group has employed an Operational Security Center to detect and
analyze IT system security events.

Risks related to the protection of intellectual assets

To mitigate the risks of third parties infringing its intellectual proprety
and the leak of know-how, TOTAL protects its rights under research
partnership agreements negotiated by the Group's intellectual
property specialists, the terms and conditions of which are
consistent with the Group's industrial and commercial strategy.

The Group has a policy of filing and maintaining patents, it monitors
technological developments in terms of freedom of use, and it
takes, when necessary, all appropriate measures to ensure the
protection of its rights.

In addition, since some of its employees have access to confidential
documents while performing their duties, TOTAL adopted internal rules
concerning the management of confidential information. The Group's
intellectual proprety specialists also carry out awareness-raising
activities with the R&D teams so that the teams are better informed
about restrictions that may apply to the use of information and data.


--- Page 76 ---

Ethical misconduct and non-compliance risks

Fraud prevention

The Group deploys an anti-fraud and fraud prevention program and
has implemented a range of procedures and programs that help to
prevent, detect and limit different types of fraud. This effort is
supported by the business principles and values of individual
behavior described in the Group's Code of Conduct and other
standards applied by the Group's business segments.

The Group has issued a directive for handling incidents of fraud that
has been widely distributed to employees, and has created an alert
system that employees can use to report acts including those that
may constitute fraud.

In 2015, a large campaign on fraud risks to raise awareness of all
Group employees was launched. A guide on “Prevention and Fight
Against Fraud”, which highlights the different actions conducted
through the anti-fraud program, was distributed. A map of fraud
risks in the Group was finalized in late 2015, allowing priority
actions to be defined for 2016. A guide to the different types of
fraud risk, with descriptions of the main risks, was distributed in
2016. Fraud risk analyses are carried out in the subsidiaries. An
awareness campaign relating to the four major fraud risks was
launched at the end of 2016, particularly by means of videos widely
distributed within the Group.

The deployment of the anti-fraud and fraud prevention program
relies on the network of fraud risks coordinators within the business
segments and operational entities.

Prevention of corruption risks

General Management constantly reiterates the principle of zero
tolerance with regard to corruption. The Corruption Prevention
Policy was updated in 2016, thus reaffirming the Group's
commitment to the matter. Internal rules have been published since
2011 in this area. They cover various areas where particular risks of
exposure to corruption may exist (business partnerships,
representatives dealing with public officials, procurement and sales,
donations, acquisitions, joint ventures, human resources, gifts and
invitations, etc.) in an effort to detect, assess and address risks at a
very early stage through an appropriate due diligence process.

To support this program, awareness campaigns aimed at all
employees are conducted and training is regularly given to those in
positions with the greatest risk of exposure. For more information,
refer to point 3.7 of chapter 7.

In addition, more than 370 Compliance Officers have been
appointed and trained within the business segments and
operational entities. Their role is to ensure that the program is
implemented at the local level.

Finally, under the settlements reached in 2013 between TOTAL,

the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S.
Department of Justice, an independent monitor had been
appointed for three years to conduct a review of anti-corruption
compliance and related internal control procedures implemented by
the Group and to recommend improvements, where necessary. In
July 2016, the monitor submitted his third and final report, in which
he certified that TOTAL had devised and implemented an
appropriate compliance program. As a result of this certification, the
U.S. authorities concluded, after having reviewed the monitor's
report, that TOTAL had fulfilled all of its obligations, thus bringing an
end to the monitoring process. As a result, a court in the State of
Virginia granted a motion to dismiss on November 9, 2016, thereby
terminating the procedure directed at the Company, which can no

longer be pursued in the United States for these same facts. The
mobililization of the entire Group and its efforts in this area continue
with the goal of ensuring the durability, evolution and continuous
improvment of this compliance program.

Prevention of competition law infringement

A Group policy aimed at ensuring compliance with, and preventing
infringement of, competition law has been in place since 2014 and
is a follow-up to the various measures previously implemented by
the business segments. Its deployment is based, in particular, on
management and staff involvement, training courses that include an
e-learning module and an organization responsible for
implementing the program.

Prevention of market abuse and conflict of interests

The Group implements a policy to prevent market abuse linked to
trading on the financial markets that is based, in particular, on
internal ethics rules that are updated on a regular basis and widely
distributed to employees. In addition, the Group's senior executives
and certain employees, in light of their positions, are asked to
refrain from carrying out any transactions, including hedging
transactions, on TOTAL shares or ADRs and in collective
investment plans (FCPE) invested primarily in TOTAL shares (as well
as derivatives related to such shares) on the day on which the
Company discloses its periodic results publications (quarterly,
interim and annual) as well as during the 30 calendar-day period
preceding such date. An annual campaign specifies the applicable
“blackout” periods.

To prevent conflicts of interest, each of the Group's senior
executives completes an annual statement declaring any conflicts
of interest to which they may be subject. By completing this
declaration, each senior executive also agrees to report to their
supervisor any conflict of interest that he or she has had or of which
he or she is aware in performing his or her duties. An internal rule
named “Conflicts of Interests”, published in 2015, reminds all
employees of their obligation to report to their supervisor any
situation that might give rise to a conflict of interests.

4.3.2. Internal control procedures related
to the preparation and processing
of accounting and financial information

Accounting information

The Group's Accounting Department, which reports to the Group's
Chief Financial Officer, draws up the Group’s Consolidated Financial
Statements according to IFRS standards based on the reporting
packages prepared quarterly by the consolidated entities, as well
as the statutory financial statements of TOTAL S.A. as parent
company and those of certain French entities. Each quarter, the
Consolidated Financial Statements and statutory financial
statements of TOTAL S.A. are reviewed by the Audit Committee
and the Board of Directors.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared based on the
following principles:

- homogeneity of the accounting framework and standards; to this
end, the interpretation of accounting standards applicable to the
Consolidated Financial Statements is centralized by the Group's
Accounting Department, which also distributes these standards
through formal procedures and an internal financial reporting
manual. The department monitors the effective implementation of
these standards through periodic formal communication with
managers of the business segments; and

Internal control and risk management procedures

- asupervised account closing process based mainly on
formalization of economic assumptions, judgments and
estimates, treatment of complex accounting transactions and on
respect of established timetables announced through Group
instructions disclosed to each entity.

Off-balance sheet commitments, which are valued according to the
financial reporting manual are reported on a quarterly basis to the
Audit Committee.

Internal control of accounting information is mainly focused around
the following areas:

- amonthly financial report is formalized by Group and business
segment control panels. This report and the Consolidated
Financial Statements use the same framework and standards. In
addition, the quarterly closing schedule is the same for preparing
the Consolidated Financial Statements and financial reporting;

- a detailed analysis of differences as part of the quarterly
reconciliation between the Consolidated Financial Statements
and financial reporting is supervised by the Accounting
and Budget-Controlling Divisions, which are part of
the Finance Division;

- a detailed analysis of differences between actual amounts and
the yearly budget established on a monthly basis is realized at
each level of the organization;

- an annual reconciliation between the parent company financial
statements and the financial statements based on IFRS
standards is performed by entity;

- periodic controls are designed to ensure the reliability of
accounting information and mainly concern the processes for
preparing aggregated financial items;

- aregular process for the signature of representation letters is
deployed at each level of the organization; and

- the Disclosure Committee ensures the application of the
procedures in place.

Because of the important contribution of the equity affiliates to the
Group's aggregated financial items, an annual review of the control
on these companies’ financial statements is implemented based on
a detailed questionnaire completed by each entity. This system is
integrated into the Group's internal control framework.

control processes are audited periodically.

The strategic outlook published by the Group is prepared, in
particular, according to the long-term plans drawn up at the
business segment and Group levels, and on the work carried out at
each relevant level of the organization. The Board of Directors
reviews the strategic outlook each year.

Disclosure control

The external communication of material information concerning the
Group's performance is prepared for shareholders, financial
analysts, business partners, regulators, government entities and
other stakeholders as part of formal internal procedures, including
in particular disclosure controls and procedures. The aim of these
procedures is to confirm the quality and accuracy of external
communications intended for financial markets.

The Disclosure Committee ensures that these procedures are
followed and meets before press releases on results are submitted
to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors.

In addition, a specific process is in place for reporting any
information related to the Group's accounting procedures, internal
control and auditing. This process is available to any shareholder,
employee or third party.

The Group's General Management is responsible for implementing
and assessing the internal control system for financial disclosure. In
this context, the implementation of the Group's internal control
framework, based on the various components of the COSO
framework, is assessed internally at regular intervals within the
Group's main entities.

Pursuant to the requirements introduced by Section 302 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and
the Chief Financial Officer of the Company have conducted, with
the assistance of members of several departments of the Group
(e.g., Legal, Audit & Internal Control and Corporate
Communications), an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures, over the period covered by the
annual report on Form 20-F. For fiscal year 2016, the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

The statutory auditors also perform those internal control audits
that they deem necessary as part of their mission to certify the
Financial Statements.

Refer to point 4.2 above (Control activities and assessment).
