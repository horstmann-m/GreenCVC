6.1 MANAGEMENT REPORT

6.1.1 Management report

Data included in the income statement, statement of financial
position and statement of cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2013 are based on unaudited pro forma figures",
calculated as if SUEZ Environnement had been accounted for using
the equity method as of January 1, 2013. The basis used to prepare
this pro forma data is disclosed in Section 6 of this report. In
addition, the 2013 data have been restated due to the application of
the new consolidation standards and incorporate the new definition
of EBITDA (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).

2014 was marked by a particularly mild climate in Europe as well as.
the shutdown of the Doel 3 and Tihange 2 nuclear power plants on
March 26, 2014, followed by the Doel 4 plant between August 5
and December 19.

Revenues fell by 6.6% on a reported basis to €74.7 billion (down by
7.2% on an organic basis) compared with 2013. This decrease is
due in particular to the impact of climatic conditions on sales of
natural gas in France (2014 was particularly mild compared with
2013) and lower electricity market prices in Europe. Adjusted for
climate impacts in France and the gas price “catch-up” recorded in
2013, which had a €2.3 billion impact, revenues were down by
4.4% on an organic basis.

EBITDA, which amounted to €12.1 billion for the year, was down
6.7% on a reported basis (organic decrease of 4.2%). Adjusted for
climatic conditions in France and the gas price “catch-up” recorded
in 2013 with a total €815 million year-on-year impact, EBITDA was
up 2.4% on an organic basis. This indicator was boosted by the
positive impact of the commissioning of new assets, a strong
operating performance, the positive results of the Group’s Perform
2015 plan and the positive variation in net additions to provisions
compared with 2013, which were partially offset by outages at
certain nuclear power plants, the fall in electricity market prices in
Europe and adverse hydrological conditions in Latin America.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method declined by 6.6% on a

reported basis and 3.4% on an organic basis to €7.2 billion. The
decrease in EBITDA was mitigated by lower depreciation and
amortization charges mainly owing to the significant impairment
losses recognized at end-2013. Adjusted for climatic conditions in
France and the gas price “catch-up”, this indicator was up 8.2% on
an organic basis.

Net income Group share totaled €2.4 billion in 2014, up
€12.1 billion on a reported basis compared with 2013. 2013 was.
heavily impacted by impairment losses, which reduced net income
Group share by €12.7 billion.

Net recurring income Group share amounted to €3.1 billion in
2014, down €0.3 billion year on year. The decline in current
operating income after share in net income of entities accounted for
using the equity method was offset to a large extent by lower
recurring financial expenses thanks to more active debt
management and a lower recurring tax expense.

Cash flow from operations amounted to €7.9 billion, down
€2.4 billion compared with 2013. This decrease is mainly due to the
fall in cash generated from operations before income tax and
working capital requirements, and the change in working capital
requirements, which was related in particular to the impact of
changes in oil prices on margin calls. This was partially offset by
lower interest payments thanks to the decrease in average net debt.

Net debt stood at €27.5 billion at end-December 2014, down
€1.3 billion year on year, reflecting the following items: (i) cash
generated from operations before income tax and working capital
requirements for the year (€11.8 billion) and the issue of hybrid
notes also called deeply-subordinated perpetual notes by GDF
SUEZ SA at the beginning of June (€2.0 billion); (ii) this was offset by
the change in working capital requirements (€1.2 billion), net
investments (including changes in scope of consolidation) carried
out by the Group (€3.9 billion) as well as dividends paid to
GDF SUEZ SA shareholders (€2.8 billion) and to non-controlling
interests (€0.8 billion).

(1) The IFRS consolidated financial statements presented in Section Il were approved and authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on February 25,

2016. They have been audited by the Group's Statutory Auditors.

Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014
amounted to €74.7 billion, down 6.6% compared with 2013. On an
organic basis (excluding the impact of changes in the scope of
consolidation and exchange rates), revenues fell by 7.2%. Adjusted
for the impacts of climatic conditions in France and the gas price
“catch-up” adjustments recorded in 2013 (€2.3 billion impact),
revenues were down 4.4% on an organic basis.

Changes in the scope of consolidation had a net positive
€689 million impact, mainly corresponding to Energy Services’
acquisition of Balfour Beatty Workplace in the United Kingdom
(positive €847 million impact) and Ecova in the United States
(positive €68 million impact), the full consolidation of GTT by Global
Gas & LNG (positive €186 million impact) and Energy International's
acquisition of Meenakshi in India (positive €83 million impact). These
positive impacts were partly offset by the decline in revenues
resulting from disposals carried out in Europe (negative €280 million

impact) and the United States (negative €164 million impact), mainly
by Energy International and Energy Europe.

Exchange rates had a negative €302 million impact on Group
revenues, mainly reflecting the appreciation of the euro against the
Brazilian real, the Norwegian krone, the Australian dollar and the
Thai baht. This was partly offset by the euro’s depreciation against
the pound sterling. The euro/dollar exchange rate, however,
remained stable on average compared with 2013.

Organic revenue performance varied across the Group’s business
lines: Global Gas & LNG and Infrastructures reported growth for the
year, while revenues remained stable at Energy International and
Energy Services and were down at Energy Europe.

EBITDA declined by 6.7% to €12.1 billion over the year. Excluding
the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and exchange
rates, the decrease in EBITDA came out at 4.2%.

MANAGEMENT REPORT
6.1 MANAGEMENT REPORT

Departures from the scope of consolidation had a negative €325
million impact on EBITDA, largely due to the sale of power
generation assets in France, Italy, Portugal and the United States.
Conversely, additions to the scope of consolidation had a positive
€158 million impact, largely thanks to the acquisitions made by
Energy Services (mainly Balfour Beatty Workplace in the United
Kingdom and Ecova in the United States) and Energy International's
acquisition of Meenakshi in India, as well as the full consolidation of
GTT further to its initial public offering at the end of February 2014.

Changes in exchange rates had a negative €190 million impact,
mainly due to the appreciation of the euro against the Brazilian real
and the Norwegian krone.

On an organic basis, EBITDA was down 4.2%, or €521 million, but
up 2.4%, or €294 million, when adjusted for climate impacts in
France and the gas price “catch-up” recorded in 2013. Excluding
the positive impact of the Group’s performance plan across all
business lines, this reflects the following trends:

m= EBITDA for Energy International amounted to €3,716 million, up
by 1.4% on an organic basis. This was driven by improved
performances in the United States, Thailand, Chile, the United
Kingdom, Peru and Pakistan, despite a decline in results in
Australia and weaker results in Brazil due to adverse hydrological
conditions;

m= EBITDA for Energy Europe totaled €2,020 million, down 29.2%
on an organic basis, adversely impacted by unfavorable climatic
conditions, partial outages at three nuclear power plants in
Belgium, the decrease in electricity market prices and the gas

price “catch-up” adjustments in France recorded in 2013.
Adjusted for climatic conditions in France and the gas price
“catch-up”, this decrease was contained at 11.5% on an organic
basis;

= EBITDA for Global Gas & LNG of €2,225 million was up 10.9% on
an organic basis, thanks to a strong performance in the LNG
sector in Europe and Asia and the increase in production
recorded by the Group’s Exploration & Production business as a
result of the commissioning of new assets that took place over
the year;

= EBITDA for Infrastructures declined 1.7% on an organic basis to
€3,274 million year on year, due to the milder climate compared
with the previous year, which weakened the positive impact of
higher gas prices and of increases in transport and storage
capacities marketed in Europe. Adjusted for climatic conditions in
France, EBITDA for Infrastructures was up 6.8% on an organic
basis;

= EBITDA for Energy Services advanced 3.2% on an organic basis
to €1,127 million.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities

accounted for using the equity method amounted to €7.2 billion,

down 3.4% on an organic basis compared with 2013, but up 8.2%

on an organic basis when adjusted for climatic conditions and the

gas price “catch-up” in France. This indicator shows trends by

business line comparable to those of EBITDA and is positively

impacted by lower depreciation and amortization charges following

the significant impairment losses recognized at end-2013.

(1) The Energy International business line also has a “headquarters” function, the costs for which are not broken down in the table above.

Energy International’s revenues, at €13,977 million, fell 2.9% on a
reported basis (up 0.7% on an organic basis). These movements
reflect, on the one hand, the negative €313 million impact of
changes in the scope of consolidation and the negative €195 million
impact of changes in exchange rates (due mostly to the Brazilian
real, but also the Australian dollar and Thai baht, partly offset by a
stronger pound sterling), and on the other hand, a limited organic
increase. The organic increase results chiefly from the impact of
higher prices in North and Latin America and the commissioning of
new plants in Latin America, South Asia, the Middle East and Africa,
offset by lower sales volumes in the UK retail business.

EBITDA amounted to €3,716 million, down 7.8% based on reported
figures (up 1.4% on an organic basis), after taking into account the
negative €249 million impact of changes in the scope of
consolidation and the negative €116 million impact of exchange rate
fluctuations. The organic increase mainly reflects improved
performances in North America, the United Kingdom, Peru, Chile,
Thailand and Pakistan, partly offset by exceptionally unfavorable
hydrological conditions in Brazil.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

Current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method, at €2,745 million,
decreased by 6.5% on a reported basis and improved by 4.1% on
an organic basis, in line with EBITDA trends.

Latin America

Revenues for the Latin America region rose by 5.3% based on
reported figures to €3,818 million, and moved up 11.1% on an
organic basis. In Brazil, sales growth resulted from an increase in
average bilateral sales contract prices, primarily due to inflation
indexation, an increase in transactions in the short-term market and
the progressive commissioning of the Trairi wind farm complex
(115 MW). Peru trended upwards thanks to the commissioning of
the llo Cold Reserve thermal plant (660 MW) in June 2013. In Chile,
slightly higher revenues were mostly driven by improved energy
prices linked to fuel price indexation.

Electricity sales increased by 1.4 TWh to 56.2 TWh, while gas sales
were down 1.8 TWh, particularly in Chile, coming in at 9.5 TWh.

MANAGEMENT REPORT
6.1 MANAGEMENT REPORT

EBITDA totaled €1,343 million, down 4.2% on an organic basis.
The decline in EBITDA mainly results from:

= a weaker performance in Brazil, mainly due to the unfavorable
hydrological conditions which affected the entire hydro generation
system (shortfall) and led to a significant increase in spot prices.
This decline was partly offset by an increase in activity at thermal
power plants, the completion of the commissioning of the Trairi
wind farm complex and the increase in average bilateral sales
contract prices, mainly due to inflation;

™ a robust performance in Chile, driven by wider margins thanks to
higher electricity prices and a strong operating performance from
E-CL; and for GNLM Majillones, the commissioning of the
onshore LNG storage tank in February 2014;

= positive trends in Peru, mainly reflecting the commissioning of the
llo Cold Reserve thermal plant and higher energy demand,
particularly from regulated customers.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities

accounted for using the equity method amounted to €982 million,

down 5.9% on an organic basis in line with EBITDA trends.

Asia-Pacific

Revenues for the region totaled €2,740 million, down 5.2% based
on reported figures and down 0.6% on an organic basis, chiefly
reflecting a decline in revenues for coal facilities in Australia on the
back of lower market prices, weaker demand and less availability
(following maintenance outages). These factors were partly offset by
improved activity in Thailand, spurred by an increase in demand
from industrial customers and higher prices, along with growth in
the Australian retail business.

Electricity sales remained stable at 42.8 TWh, with lower volumes in
Australia fully offsetting the 1.1 TWh increase in Thailand. Natural
gas sales rose by 0.6 TWh to 3.7 TWh.

EBITDA came in at €857 million, down 7.7% on a reported basis
and down 2.7% based on organic figures. The strong performance
from the Thailand facilities, driven mainly by the good availability of
the Gheco-1 plant and improved margins on industrial customers
was more than offset by the lower performance from Australian coal
facilities, which suffered depressed market conditions and lower
availability, and a weaker contribution from Singapore reflecting
pressure on market prices and volumes.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method came out at €638 million,
decreasing by 3.3% on an organic basis in line with EBITDA trends.

North America

Revenues for the North America region totaled €3,782 million,
representing a decrease on 2013 of 0.9% based on reported figures
and an increase of 4.0% on an organic basis. This performance was
driven primarily by the impact of the strong operating performance
of US power generation activities, aided further by extreme weather
events in the north-east of the country in the first quarter of 2014.

Electricity sales decreased 1.1 TWh on a reported basis to
64.9 TWh, reflecting lower sales volumes in the US retail business.
Prior-year volumes included 3.4 TWh from assets subsequently
sold.

Natural gas sales", excluding intra-group transactions, fell by
9.6TWh to 31.6TWh as a consequence of increased LNG
diversions performed by the Global Gas & LNG business line.

EBITDA came in at €956 million, up 10.2% on an organic basis,
mainly due to the strong year-round performance from the US
power business, which benefited from the extreme weather in the
north-east of the country in the first quarter. This was partly offset
by weaker overall performances in the LNG business due to a
decline in average cargo diversion margins.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method totaled €688 million,
representing an organic increase of 23.3% due to a combination of
EBITDA growth and lower depreciation and amortization charges.

United Kingdom & Turkey

Revenues for the United Kingdom & Turkey region totaled €2,957
million, down 16.2% on a reported basis partly due to asset
disposals in Continental Europe. On an organic basis, revenues for
the region fell 14.5%, hit by lower sales volumes from UK retail
activities.

Electricity sales fell 5.9 TWh to 30.1 TWh, mainly due to lower
volumes in the UK generation and retail business. The decline also
reflects a reduction of 1.0 TWh due to the impact of the asset
portfolio optimization program in Continental Europe. Gas sales
were 35.2 TWh, down 4.3 TWh on an organic basis due to lower
volumes for the UK and Turkish retail businesses.

EBITDA came in at €380 million, up 10.6% on an organic basis due
to an improvement in captured spreads compared to 2013.
Favorable one-off items in the UK retail business offset the fall in
sales volumes.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method was €271 million, up
22.1% on an organic basis, spurred by a rise in EBITDA coupled
with lower depreciation and amortization charges due to the
impairment losses recognized against certain assets in 2013.

(1) Natural gas total sales volumes increased by 3.5 TWh to 72.7 TWh, primarily due to higher LNG cargo diversion volumes.

South Asia, Middle East & Africa

Revenues for the South Asia, Middle East & Africa region (“SAMEA”)
totaled €679 million, an increase of 28.0% on a reported basis and
16.9% on an organic basis. This organic growth is mainly related to
the commissioning of Uch II (Pakistan, 375 MW) in April 2014 and to
higher development fees earned on projects. Growth in reported
revenues also reflects the acquisition of Meenakshi (India, 300 MW)
in December 2013, mitigated by the equity consolidation of Sohar in
Oman (the interest in the company decreased from 45% to 35% in
May 2018).

Electricity sales amounted to 8.7 TWh, representing an increase of
1.4 TWh. This is mainly due to the acquisition of Meenakshi (positive

6.1.1.2.2 Energy Europe

MANAGEMENT REPORT

6.1 MANAGEMENT REPORT

1.3 TWh impact) at the end of 2013 and the commissioning of Uch
Il (positive 2 TWh impact), offset to some extent by the partial sale of
Sohar and resulting change of consolidation method (negative
1.3 TWh impact).

EBITDA came in at €298 million, representing an increase of 1.6%
on an organic basis. This increase comes mainly from the
commissioning of Uch Il and a rise in the development fees earned
in 2014, and is partly offset by higher maintenance costs and
one-off items.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method amounted to €286 million,
up 1.7% on an organic basis. This increase is explained by the
same factors that impacted EBITDA trends.

Energy Europe’s revenues totaled €35,158 million, down 17.7%, or
17.5% on an organic basis. This decrease chiefly reflects the impact
of climatic conditions on gas sales (2014 was a particularly mild year
whereas 2013 had been a particularly cold one), the fall in sales
prices, and periods of outages at certain nuclear facilities. Gas sales
amounted to 606TWh, including 95 TWh to key accounts.
Electricity sales amounted to 160 TWh. At end-December 2014,
Energy Europe had almost 13.8 million individual customers for gas
and almost 5.7 million electricity customers.

The business line’s EBITDA dropped 29.8% to €2,020 million (down
29.2% on an organic basis). 2014 was penalized by unfavorable
weather conditions, the shutdown of the Doel3 and Tihange 2
power plants as from March 26, 2014 and the Doel 4 plant between
August 5 and December 19, the fall in prices on the electricity
market, and the price “catch-up” adjustments in France recognized
in 2018 (relating to 2011 and 2012, and concerning natural gas).
These impacts were partly offset by performance efforts within the
business line and by the fall in net additions to provisions compared
to 2013.

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

Current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method also fell, reflecting the
decline in EBITDA. This was partially offset by lower depreciation
and amortization charges following the impairment losses
recognized against certain assets at December 31, 2013.

Central Western Europe (CWE)

The contribution of CWE to Group revenues amounted to
€29,285 million, down 18.9%, or 18.8% lower on an organic basis.

CWE’s EBITDA declined by 39.4% (38.9% on an organic basis),
due to unfavorable climatic conditions, lower prices, outages at the
three nuclear reactors Doel 3, Tihange 2 and Doel 4, and the
impact of price “catch-up” adjustments recorded in France in 2013.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities

notably due to less favorable climatic conditions in 2014 and the
price “catch-up” adjustments recorded in 2013.

Natural gas sales were down 74.9 TWh; mild weather during the
year reduced sales by 21.7 TWh, whereas the very cold weather in
2013 added 17.3 TWh to sales. The decline in sales was also linked
to competitive pressure and weaker demand due to energy saving
efforts. GDF SUEZ still holds around 80% of the retail market and
around 42% of the business market.

CWE BENELUX & GERMANY

Electricity sales declined by 5.4 TWh despite higher sales to direct

Revenues from the Benelux & Germany region amounted to
€9,964 million, a drop of 18.8% (down 19.1% on an organic basis)
compared to 2013.

Electricity sales in Belgium and Luxembourg were down 7.9 TWh.
This mainly reflects a decrease in wholesale market sales due to
lower electricity production (down 8.8 TWh) resulting from the
extended outage at certain nuclear reactors, and the erosion of
market share in 2013 (retail market share has since stabilized at
around 49%).

Electricity sales fell 0.7 TWh in the Netherlands and held firm in
Germany, slipping 0.1 TWh.

the erosion of market share. Market share has stabilized since the
beginning of the year, at around 45% of the retail market in Belgium.

EBITDA for the region was down 33.0% on an organic basis,
reflecting the unavailability of certain nuclear reactors, falling

OF ENTITIES ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD

Southern & Eastern Europe region revenues dropped by 11.3%
(down 10.6% on an organic basis), mainly due to lower sales of
electricity and gas in Italy (wholesale market and end customers).

EBITDA for Southern & Eastern Europe jumped 45.5% driven by the

The sharp increase in the contribution to revenues was driven by:

= growth of 40 TWh in external LNG sales with volumes of
119 TWh for 2014, representing 142 cargoes (of which 75
shipped to Asia), compared to volumes of 79 TWh for 2013,

man increase in the Exploration & Production hydrocarbon
production contribution (48.9 Mboe for 2014 versus 45.4 Mboe
for 2013), following the recent commissioning of facilities, offset
by the negative impact of the decrease in commodity prices;

= the full consolidation of GTT further to its initial public offering
(IPO) in late February 2014.

Hydrocarbon production for 2014 was up 3.6 Mboe to 55.5 Mboe

versus 51.9 Mboe in 2013. The level of hydrocarbon production

over the full year was boosted by the restart of Njord and the

commissioning of the Amstel field in the Netherlands (February), and

Gudrun and H-North in Norway (April and September, respectively).

EBITDA for the Global Gas & LNG business line in 2014 amounted
to €2,225 million, up 9.7% on a reported basis compared to 2013.
Organic growth came in at 10.9%, spurred by a fall in net additions
to provisions, strong LNG activity in Europe and Asia, and the rise in
total hydrocarbon production (newly commissioned facilities),
partially offset by the fall in commodity prices.

6.1.1.2.4 Infrastructures

Current operating income after share in net income of entities

OF ENTITIES ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD

Total revenues for the Infrastructures business line, including
intra-group transactions, remained stable year on year at €6,812
million in 2014, reflecting:

the annual review in France of distribution infrastructure access
tariffs (2.9% increase on July 1, 2014 and 4.1% increase on
July 1, 2013) and of transport infrastructure tariffs (8.9% increase
on April 1, 2014 and 8.3% increase on April 1, 2013);

additional transport capacity offered in the South through JTS
(Joint Transport Storage), enabling combined reservations of
transport and storage capacity on the North-South link (“PEG
Nord-Sud”);

improved marketing of storage capacity in France linked to the
start of sales operations for new storage caverns in Germany
(Peckensen 4 and 5) and the United Kingdom (Stublach);

and despite the 55.1 TWh fall in volumes" distributed by GrDF
due to milder climatic conditions in 2014 compared to 2013.

In this climatic and regulatory context, the business line's
contribution to Group revenues was €2,994 million, up 17.1% year
on year as a result of:

= growth in distribution, transportation and storage activities for
third parties in an increasingly deregulated market;

™ solid natural gas purchase and sale activities to maintain technical
storage performance.

EBITDA for the Infrastructures business line amounted to

€3,274 million for the period, down 1.8% year on year (down 1.7%

on an organic basis). This decline mainly concerns the distribution

business, which was hit by a milder climate. Apart from this climate

effect, EBITDA was up 6.8% on an organic basis.

Current operating income after share in net income of entities
accounted for using the equity method for the Infrastructures
business line came in at €1,994 million for the period, down 3.6%
year on year (down 3.5% on an organic basis), with net depreciation
and amortization charges edging up 1.4%. The decrease in these
charges following the impairment losses recorded at December 31,
2013 is offset by the commissioning of new facilities.

(1) 23 TWh distributed due to cold weather conditions in 2013 versus a negative 32.1 TWh during the milder 2014.

OF ENTITIES ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD

Revenues for the Energy Services business line climbed 6.8% on a
reported basis to €15,673 million for 2014, buoyed by the
acquisitions carried out in late 2013 and in 2014 of Balfour Beatty
Workplace and Lend Lease in the United Kingdom (€847 million)
and Ecova in the United States (€68 million).

Organic revenue growth came in at 0.4%, chiefly reflecting the
growth in installation activities in France and Benelux countries,
particularly in electrical and climatic engineering activities. However,
revenue growth was partly offset by the unfavorable impact of mild
weather conditions in 2014 and the final impacts of the expiration of
gas cogeneration contracts in France and Italy resulting from the
termination of the purchasing agreements for electricity produced
by these plants.

EBITDA for Energy Services rose 8.2% to €1,127 million on a
reported basis, due chiefly to the acquisitions made in the United
Kingdom and the United States. Organic growth came out at 3.2%,

Income/(loss) from operating activities amounted to €6,574 million
in 2014 versus a loss of €7,124 million in 2013.

Impairment losses totaling €14,773 million had been recognized in
2013 (€1,037 million in 2014), of which €5,689 million against
goodwill (including goodwill on entities accounted for using the
equity method) and €8,994 million against property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets. In recognizing these impairment
losses, the Group acknowledged the profound change in the energy
paradigm in Europe.

The €1,037 million in impairment losses for 2014 were recognized
chiefly in respect of the GlobalGas & LNG business line
(€362 million), the Energy International business line (€306 million)
and the Energy Europe business line (€291 million). The impairment
losses chiefly concern (i) exploration and production assets in the
North Sea (€261 million) which have been affected by the fall in
proven and probable production reserves and by the decline in gas
prices in Europe, and (ii) thermal power plants in the UK
(€181 million) as a result of a deterioration in the market outlook.

Income/(loss) from operating activities was also affected by:

m changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives
(mark-to-market) that had a negative impact of €298 million on
income from operating activities (reflecting the impact of
transactions not eligible for hedge accounting), compared with a
negative impact of €225 million in 2013. The impact for the period
results chiefly from negative overall price effects, partly offset by
the net positive impact of unwinding positions with a negative
market value at December 31, 2013;

= restructuring costs of €167 million, compared with €285 million
the previous year;

= “Changes in scope of consolidation” (gains and losses on the
disposal of consolidated equity interests or on remeasurements
of previously held interests in accordance with IFRS 3) which had

GDF SUEZ REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014

a positive impact of €562 million in 2014, compared with a
negative impact of €41 million in 2013. Changes in the scope of
consolidation mainly relate to gains on remeasuring the previous
interest in GTT (after the Group acquired control of the company)
totaling €359 million and in Walloon inter-municipal companies
(loss of significant influence) totaling €174 million;
= “Other non-recurring items” representing income of €353 million
(chiefly reflecting the gain on the disposal of interests in Flemish
mixed inter-municipal companies), compared with income of
€535 million in 2013 (primarily resulting from the reversal of a
provision for the back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle in Belgium).
The Group reported a net financial loss of €1,876 million for 2014,
compared to a loss of €1,715 million the previous year. The
€266 million decrease in the cost of debt resulting from the fall in
outstanding borrowings and the average cost of gross debt was.
more than offset by the negative €328 million impact of
non-recurring expenses compared to 2013 (negative €236 million
impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives not eligible for
hedge accounting and negative €69 million impact of debt
restructuring transactions), and by the €114 million increase in the
discounting expense relating to provisions.

The 2013 income tax charge included an income tax benefit of
€1,593 million arising on non-recurring income statement items.
(versus €659 million in 2014). The non-recurring items essentially
related to the impairment losses recognized against property, plant
and equipment and intangible assets in 2013. Adjusted for these
items, the effective recurring tax rate was 35.0%, slightly down on
the 35.7% rate for 2013.

Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was up sharply
year-on-year, at €669 million, owing to the impairment losses
recognized in 2013.

The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets was €71.6 billion, an increase of €1.4 billion
compared to December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily the
result of investments made over the period (positive €5.8 billion
impact) and translation adjustments (positive €1.7 billion impact),
partially offset by depreciation and amortization (negative €4.7 billion
impact).

Goodwill increased by €0.8 billion to €21.2 billion, mainly as a result
of the controlling interest acquired in GTT (positive €0.4 billion
impact), along with the acquisitions of Ecova (positive €0.2 billion
impact) and Lahmeyer (positive €0.1 billion impact).

Total equity amounted to €56.0 billion, an increase of €2.3 billion
compared to December 31, 2013. This increase chiefly reflects net
income for the period (positive €3.1 billion impact), the hybrid notes

issue (positive €2.0 billion impact), the controlling interest acquired
in GTT (positive €0.5 billion impact), the effect of employee share
issues carried out as part of the Link 2014 worldwide employee
share ownership plan (positive €0.3 billion impact), and the payment
of cash dividends (negative €3.5 billion impact).

Regarding other items of comprehensive income, actuarial losses
and net investment or cash flow hedges net of tax representing a
negative €1.9 billion impact are virtually offset by translation
adjustments with a positive impact of €1.8 billion.

Provisions increased by €2.4 billion due chiefly to actuarial
differences arising in the period on provisions for post-employment
benefits (positive €1.8 billion impact), and to unwinding discounts on
provisions (positive €0.6 billion impact).

6.1.18 Outlook

2015 financial targets": a resilient net recurring income despite
the drop in oil/gas price thanks to the implementation of a
targeted “Quick Reaction Plan”

Given the recent major drop in oil and gas price, which has a
significant impact, in the short term, on the Group’s businesses
(estimated at around -€900 million on EBITDA 2015 and -€350
million on Net recurring income, Group share, based on forward
prices as of December 31, 2014), the Group has decided to launch
a quick operational reaction plan in addition to Perform 2015,
focused on targeted reductions in opex (€250 million impact on
EBITDA 2015) combined with a shift of some growth capex (€2
billion over 2015-2016).

This plan enables the Group to announce for 2015 a Net recurring
income, Group share between €3.0 and 3.3 billion, at average
weather in France, in line with the figure published for 2014. This.

MANAGEMENT REPORT
6.1 MANAGEMENT REPORT

guidance is based on estimates for EBITDA and current operating
income® of, respectively, €11.7 to 12.3 billion and €6.8 to
7.4 billion.

In addition, given its medium term growth perspectives and cash

generation for 2015-2016, the Group reaffirms its capital allocation

policy for the period 2014-2016 as follows:

= net capex" between €6 and 7 billion per year on average;

= net debt/EBITDA ratio below or equal to 2.5x and “A” category
credit rating;

= and a stable dividend policy with a pay-out ratio” of 65-75%
and a minimum of 1 euro per share, payable in cash.

6.1.2.1 Borrowing conditions and financial
structure applicable to the Issuer

Debt structure

Gross debt (excluding bank overdrafts, amortized cost and financial
derivative instruments) amounted to €36.4 billion on December 31,
2014, down from the previous year, and was primarily made up of
€22.9 billion in bond issues and €6.6 billion in bank loans (including
finance leases). Other loans and drawdowns on credit lines
accounted for a total of €1.7 billion. Short-term loans (commercial
paper) accounted for 14% of total gross debt at the end of 2014.

77% of the gross debt was issued on financial markets (bond issues
and commercial paper).

Net debt, excluding amortized costs, the effect of financial derivative
instruments and cash collateral, came to €27.5 billion at the end of
2014.

At the end of 2014, the net debt was 69% denominated in euros,
13% in US dollars and 6% in British pounds, excluding amortized
cost but after the foreign exchange impact of derivatives.

After the impact of derivatives, 80% of the net debt was at a fixed
rate. On December 31, 2014, the average cost of gross debt stood
at 3.14%, down 26 points compared to 2013. The average maturity
of net debt was 9.1 years.

Main transactions in 2014

The main transactions in 2014 affecting financial debt are described
in Note 16.3.2 of Section 6.2 “Consolidated financial statements”. In
addition, the Group renewed €5 billion in pooled credit lines ahead
of schedule, extending their maturity to April 2019.

The list of projects financed under the Green Bond issued in
May 2014 for a total of €2.5 billion is found in Section 5.1.6.5
“Green Bond”.

respectively.

6.1.2.2 Restrictions on the use of capital

On December 31, 2014, the Group had total undrawn confirmed
credit lines (usable, among other things, as back-up lines for the
commercial paper programs) of €13.3 billion. Of these lines, 91%
are managed in a pooled fashion and are not subject to any financial
covenant or bound by a credit risk rating. The counterparties of
these lines are well diversified, with no single counterparty holding
more than 6% of the total of these pooled lines. No pooled credit
facility was in use as of the end of 2014.

Furthermore, the Group has set up credit lines in some subsidiaries,
for which the documentation includes ratios related to their financial
standing. These lines of credit are not guaranteed by GDF SUEZ SA
or GIE GDF SUEZ Alliance.

The definition, as well as the level of these ratios, also known as
“financial covenants”, are determined by agreement with the lenders
and may be reviewed during the life of the loan.

The most frequent ratios are:

(1) Targets assume average weather conditions in France, full pass through of supply costs in French regulated gas tarifs, restart of Doel 3 and Tihange 2
as of July 1, 2015, no significant regulatory and macro-economic changes, commodity price assumptions based on market conalitions as of
December 31, 2074 for the non-hedged part of the production, and average foreign exchange rates as follows for 2015: €/$: 1.22, €/BRL: 3.23.

(2) Atter share in net income of entities accounted for using the equity method.

(3) Net capex = gross capex ~ disposals (cash and net debt impact).

(4) Based on net recurring income, Group share.

6.1.2.3 Expected sources on financing to honor
commitments relative to investment decisions

The Group believes that its funding needs will be covered by
available cash and the possible use of its existing credit facilities.
However, it may call upon the capital markets on an ad hoc basis.

If necessary, dedicated financing could be established for very
specific projects.

The Group has a total of €3.4 billion in credit lines or loans expiring
in 2015 (excluding the maturity of €5.2 billion in commercial paper).
In addition, at December 31, 2014 it had €8.9 billion in cash (net of
bank overdrafts) and a total of €13.3 billion in available lines (not net
of the amount of commercial paper issued), including €1 billion
expiring in 2015.
