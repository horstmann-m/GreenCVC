Beiersdorf is a global leader in the consumer goods industry with a total of over
17,000 employees in more than 150 affiliates. It is divided into two business
segments:

© The Consumer Business Segment, whose strong brands focus on the inter-
national skin and body care markets, is the main business.

© The tesa Business Segment is a pioneering manufacturer of self-adhesive
products and solutions for industry, craft businesses, and consumers.

Consumer Business Segment

BLUE AGENDA - THE STRATEGIC COMPASS

Beiersdorf aims to be the No. 1 skin care company in its relevant categories and
markets. The company’s Blue Agenda clearly defines the way to achieve this
long-term objective. It consists of the following strategic focuses:

© Strengthening our brands - first and foremost NIVEA

© Increasing our innovation power

© Expanding our presence in the emerging markets and consolidating our
market position in Europe

© The people at Beiersdorf

Business and Strategy

Beiersdorf continued to make substantial progress towards these objectives in
the year under review - something that is also reflected in the key figures for
fiscal year 2014. Beiersdorf recorded sustainable, profitable growth and saw a
further increase in sales and earnings excluding special factors. This was
achieved by increasing our share of a market that grew by about 3%.

STRONG BRANDS

Beiersdorf’s consistently disciplined brand strategy further increased its brand
presence in 2014, as can be seen from the positive performance by our three
core brands - NIVEA, Eucerin, and La Prairie. The rollout of the new NIVEA logo
and design, which began in 2013, was successfully completed in the year under
review. This created a more consistent and eye-catching brand image, which
has significantly strengthened the brand’s identity and positioned NIVEA suc-
cessfully and sustainably. In addition, Beiersdorf’s newly created “Pearl Brands”
unit generated new momentum for the Labello, 8x4, Hidrofugal, and Florena
brands. Beiersdorf’s goal is to strengthen their brand profile and hence leverage
their economic potential, and in doing so further strengthen the company’s
brand portfolio.

INNOVATION POWER

The significant increase in Beiersdorf’s innovation capacity substantially con-
tributed to its success in the year under review. Beiersdorf focuses both on
developing and launching new products and on systematically enhancing and
supporting existing major innovations. Beiersdorf’s NIVEA Deo Black & White,
NIVEA Body In-Shower, and NIVEA Face Cellular Anti-Age set long-term trends
in different segments, enabling the company to consistently extend its market
position in the relevant categories and countries in 2014.

For example, NIVEA Face Cellular Anti-Age was also successfully launched in
Latin America in the year under review. The NIVEA Body In-Shower product
line, which is a big hit in Europe and Brazil, was expanded in 2014 and will be
available worldwide in 2015. Moreover, Beiersdorf again set new standards in
the mass market in the important face care category with its NIVEA Q10 pearls.
A special pearl technology makes it possible to blend innovative Q10 plus serum
pearls with hydrogel in a patented anti-wrinkle serum. This is the first time that
this type of technology has been made accessible to a wider consumer group.

Beiersdorf’s research and development expertise plays a key role in its continuous
innovation strength. Dr. May Shana’a, Head of R&D at Beiersdorf since fall 2014,
will continue to strategically enhance the efficacy of the company’s R&D activities
and deepen the growing focus on localization.

CLOSEST TO MARKETS

Each and every innovation begins with the specific needs of consumers in the
different regions. Being close to consumers at a local level is crucial to being
able to incorporate changing expectations into product development flexibly
and quickly, and hence to secure our market share in the long term. In the year
under review, Beiersdorf sustainably increased its brand presence and impact in
the emerging markets with targeted investments in regional development and
production capacities, and strengthened its position on the established European
markets.

In July 2014, Beiersdorf opened a production facility and a regional laboratory
in Silao, Mexico, in order to meet growing demand in Latin America. The factory
was the first facility in the cosmetics industry ever to be awarded Leadership in

23

Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) platinum standard. Beiersdorf also
began constructing a production facility in Sanand in order to strengthen its
local footprint in India. Production is expected to start in early 2015.

DEDICATED BEIERSDORF PEOPLE - A STRONG CORPORATE
CULTURE

Beiersdorf's corporate culture is inextricably bound up with dedicated and mo-
tivated employees, who make a crucial contribution to the company’s success.
In 2014, employees and managers worked together to reinterpret Beiersdorf’s
core values - which have shaped the company for over 130 years - and docu-
mented these in a common understanding.

© Care - at the heart of Beiersdorf’s business. The company’s responsibility
towards its employees, consumers, and brands as well as to society and the
environment.

© Simplicity - making clear, consistent, and quick decisions and always remain-
ing focused on priorities.

© Courage - setting ambitious targets, taking the initiative, and approaching
change as an opportunity.

© Trust - genuine, respectful, and reliable relationships with employees and
consumers.

In order to ensure the Core Values are lived both now and in the future, Beiersdorf
will integrate them even more strongly into its employees’ day-to-day working
practices in the future. In addition, Beiersdorf continued actively encouraging
employees to make decisions and take an entrepreneurial approach in the year
under review, systematically enhancing the company’s speed and flexibility
even further.

Management and Control

The Executive Board manages the company and is dedicated to sustainably
increasing its value. In addition to the functional areas of responsibility within
the Executive Board - Finance and Supply Chain, Human Resources, Consumer
Brands and R&D, and Pharmacy - there are regional areas of responsibility. This
regional allocation of responsibilities is a key factor in ensuring the Executive
Board is closely involved in the company’s operational business. The Chairman
of the Executive Board is responsible at an overarching level for corporate
development and the Internal Audit function. The tesa Business Segment is
managed as an independent subgroup.

Information on the remuneration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory
Board as well as on incentive and bonus systems is provided in the remunera-
tion report, which forms part of the Group management report. The Corporate
Governance Statement in accordance with § 289a Handelsgesetzbuch (German
Commercial Code, HGB) has been made publicly available on the company’s
website at WWW.BEIERSDORF.COM/CORPORATE_GOVERNANCE_ STATEMENT.
Additional information regarding management and control, the general manage-
ment structure, and the Declaration of Compliance in accordance with § 161
Aktiengesetz (German Stock Corporation Act, AktG) is also provided in the
Corporate Governance Report.

Value Management and Performance

Management System

The goal of Beiersdorf’s business activities is to sustainably increase the com-
pany’s market share by achieving qualitative growth and at the same time to
expand its earnings base. The long-term key performance indicators - sales
growth in conjunction with market share, EBIT, and the EBIT margin (the ratio of
EBIT to sales) - are derived from this. The goal is to generate internationally
competitive returns through systematic cost management and the highly effi-
cient use of resources.

The company has created an efficient management system in order to meet
these strategic goals. Corporate management derives the business perfor-
mance targets for the individual units in the Group for the coming year from the
Group's strategic business goals. This planning covers all segments and affili-
ates. Generally, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board formally adopt the
Group's planning for the following year in the fall.

Actual key performance indicators are compared with target values and with
the current forecast for the year as a whole at regular intervals during the fiscal
year. These comparisons are used to manage the business in line with the objec-
tives.

The tesa Business Segment forms a separate, independent unit within the
Group. It is also managed on the basis of sales growth, the operating result
(EBIT), and the EBIT margin.

Economic Environment

General Economic Situation

Positive global growth was recorded in 2014, slightly above the previous year;
however, the outlook deteriorated increasingly in the course of the year due to
the geopolitical crises. While the mature economies continued on their modest
path to recovery, growth rates in some emerging countries declined.

Beiersdorf Annual Report 2014 / Group Management Report / Business and Strategy
Economic Environment

The economy in Europe stagnated in 2014. The unrest in Ukraine in particular
dampened investor appetite and led to continuing high levels of uncertainty in
the markets. Interest rate cuts and a new ECB securities purchase program led to
a fallin the euro, improving eurozone companies’ competitiveness and helping to
mitigate adverse effects on exports. Positive growth was achieved, although the
optimistic expectations voiced at the beginning of the year failed to materialize.

The German economy recorded moderate growth in 2014. Although Germany
has consistently served as an economic motor in recent years, recording the
highest growth rates in the eurozone, growth declined in 2014. The EU’s eco-
nomic sanctions against Russia slowed both exports and capital investment.
Low unemployment, low interest rates, low inflation, and the weaker euro all
helped to support the economy.

The economy in the United States recorded a positive performance in 2014.
Results for the first quarter were lower than in the previous year due to adverse
weather conditions. After that, economic momentum improved and was reflected
in increased capital expenditure and consumer spending.

Capital expenditure and consumer spending in Japan declined following an
increase in sales tax in April 2014. The government introduced an economic
package aimed at countering the negative effects on consumer demand. Exports
declined despite the fall in the yen.

Economic growth in China fell short of forecast targets in 2014. The country’s
industrial sector recorded its lowest growth since 2008 and domestic demand
remained stubbornly low. The Chinese central bank and the government are
pursuing a policy of reform in order to achieve sustainable long-term growth
instead of high short-term growth rates.

The situation in the other emerging markets was mixed. Reforms in India had a
positive effect on economic development and boosted exports. On the other
hand, Brazil experienced reform gridlock. Russia is under pressure due to the
conflict with Ukraine. The economic sanctions and the slump in oil prices led to
a fall in the ruble and to lower capital expenditure.

Sales Market Trends

The growth rate in the cosmetics market - the market relevant for Beiersdorf -
remained flat year-on-year at a global level. The Asia, South Africa, Middle East,
and Latin America regions were the main growth drivers although the pace of
growth has slowed. The saturated markets in Western Europe and North America
continued last year’s growth path, while Eastern Europe was unable to match its
prior-year growth. The industrial sales markets experienced a recovery in
Europe and further strong growth in Asia and America in 2014. A slight positive
trend emerged in Europe as the year progressed. Asia and North America con-
tinued to benefit from a strong economic performance, while Latin America in
contrast suffered domestic currency instability and a slowdown in real growth.

Procurement Market Trends

In 2014, raw material and packaging prices were overall, relatively flat as fore-
cast. The significant reduction in global crude oil prices seen in the last quarter
was not anticipated, but has not significantly affected prices of either plastics or
fossil fuel-based raw materials.

Overall Assessment of the Economic Environment
Macroeconomic growth in 2014 was positive, despite momentum slowing in
the course of the year. The global cosmetics market maintained the previous
year’s level of growth, although growth rates in some individual markets eased.
The Consumer Business Segment recorded another increase in sales in this
challenging economic environment. Sales by the tesa Business Segment rose
again on the back of the recovery in its industrial sales markets in Europe as well
as further growth in Asia and the Americas. The consumer business and the
distribution business aimed at craftsmen also performed well in Europe.

SALES

Organic Group sales in 2014 were up 4.7% on the prior-year figure. The Consum-
er Business Segment grew by 4.8%, while tesa generated a sales increase of
4.4%. Nominal Group sales rose by 2.3% as against the previous year, to €6,285
million (previous year: €6,141 million).

In Europe, organic sales were up 2.4% on the prior year. In nominal terms, sales
amounted to €3,421 million (previous year: €3,390 million), 0.9% higher than
the prior-year figure.

Organic growth in the Americas amounted to 5.6%. In nominal terms, sales rose
by 2.2% to €1,116 million (previous year: €1,092 million).

The Africa /Asia/ Australia region reported organic growth of 9.0%. In nominal
terms, growth of 5.4% to €1,748 million was achieved (previous year: €1,659 mil-
lion).

543 537 -1.2

EXPENSES / OTHER OPERATING RESULT

Cost of goods sold rose by 5.0%, and hence faster than sales. This change was
mainly due to the stronger increase in Consumer sales in the emerging markets,
which generally entail a higher ratio of product costs to sales, and a change in
the product mix. In some countries, exchange rate changes also had a negative
impact on the companies’ procurement costs. Advertising and trade marketing
expenses declined to €1,461 million (previous year: €1,495 million) without re-
ducing support for the brands, thanks to efficient use of the marketing budget.
At €2,604 million, total expenses remained constant (previous year: €2,605
million), due to further investment in marketing and sales. Following the realign-
ment of the Research and Development area in the Consumer Business Seg-
ment, Consumer expenses were increased again in order to further improve our
innovation capacity. tesa also invested more in research and development; the
total expenses of €168 million were up 9.0% on the prior-year value of €154 mil-
lion. The increase in general and administrative expenses to €330 million (pre-
vious year: €312 million) reflects the work carried out to improve the existing

software systems in the Consumer Business Segment in particular. The other
operating result (excluding special factors) amounted to €45 million (previous
year: €-1 million). The change in the other operating result was dominated by
the reversal of provisions, income from the sale of fixed assets, and lower other
operating expenses.

OPERATING RESULT (EBIT, EXCLUDING SPECIAL FACTORS)

The Beiersdorf Group’s results of operations are assessed on the basis of the
operating result (EBIT) excluding special factors. This figure is not part of IFRSs
and should be treated merely as voluntary additional information. The special
factors listed are one-time, non-operating transactions.

EBIT excluding special factors rose to €861 million (previous year: €814 mil-
lion), while the EBIT margin was 13.7% (previous year: 13.2%). The Consumer
Business Segment generated EBIT excluding special factors of €678 million
(previous year: €638 million); the EBIT margin reached 13.0% (previous year:
12.5%). EBIT in the tesa Business Segment rose from €176 million in the prior
year to €183 million in the past fiscal year; the EBIT margin was 17.0% (pre-
vious year: 16.9%).

The Group operating result before special factors in Europe was €589 million
(previous year: €542 million). The EBIT margin was 17.2% (previous year: 16.0%).

The operating result before special factors in the Americas amounted to €80
million (previous year: €82 million). The EBIT margin was 7.1% (previous
year: 7.5%).

In Africa/Asia / Australia, EBIT excluding special factors amounted to €192 mil-
lion (previous year: €190 million). The EBIT margin was 11.0% (previous
year: 11.5%).

SPECIAL FACTORS

Special factors of €-65 million (previous year: €6 million) related to the Con-
sumer Business Segment. Due to an adjustment to the long-term sales and
earnings outlook for our Chinese hair care business, we performed an impair-
ment test as of September 30, 2014. This led to our hair care brands being
written down by €67 million to a residual carrying amount of €21 million. In
addition, provisions that had been recognized in connection with the realign-
ment of our corporate structures in the past but were no longer required were
reversed. Prior-year special factors related to both business segments. In
the Consumer Business Segment, expenses of €12 million were incurred in
the previous year as part of the realignment of corporate structures and pro-
cesses, mainly resulting from the reorganization of the business in China.
In the tesa Business Segment, income of €18 million was generated in the pre-
vious year in connection with the closure of a production facility in Singapore.

EBIT including special factors was €796 million (previous year: €820 million).
This corresponds to an EBIT margin of 12.7% (previous year: 13.4%).

FINANCIAL RESULT

The financial result amounted to €15 million (previous year:€-5 million). The in-
crease was due to income of €9 million in connection with a tax refund; interest
income from financial assets remained stable. In addition, improvements in cur-
rency effects and in net income from investments were generated in the other
financial result.

INCOME TAXES
Income taxes amounted to €274 million (previous year: €272 million). The tax
rate was 33.8% (previous year: 33.4%).

PROFIT AFTER TAX

Profit after tax decreased to €537 million (previous year: €543 million); the re-

profit after tax amounted to €581 million (previous year: €537 million). The cor-
responding return on sales after tax was 9.2% (previous year: 8.7%).

EARNINGS PER SHARE - DIVIDENDS

Earnings per share amounted to €2.33 (previous year: €2.35). Excluding special
factors, earnings per share amounted to €2.53 (previous year: €2.33). These
figures were calculated on the basis of the weighted number of shares bearing
dividend rights (226,818,984). The Executive Board and Supervisory Board will
propose a dividend of €0.70 per no-par value share bearing dividend rights to
the Annual General Meeting (previous year: €0.70). For further information on

Sales by the Consumer Business Segment grew organically by 4.8% in 2014. The
strong euro on average during the year led to a reduction of 2.6 percentage
points in this figure as a result of negative effects from currency translation.
Structural changes reduced growth by 0.1 percentage points. In nominal terms,
sales therefore increased by 2.1% to €5,209 million (previous year: €5,103
million).

The healthy organic sales trend is proof of the systematic implementation of our
corporate strategy as set out in our internal Blue Agenda program. Thanks to
our strong innovations and outstanding marketing concepts, we increased our
market share in both the saturated markets of Europe and the emerging mar-

kets, where we achieved double-digit growth rates in some cases. Our three
core brands - NIVEA, Eucerin, and La Prairie - once again achieved very encour-
aging growth rates.

NIVEA achieved global organic growth of 6.2% in 2014. The key growth drivers
were NIVEA Deo, NIVEA Shower, and NIVEA Body. In the NIVEA Deo category,
Stress Protect - introduced in the previous year - and the launch of Powder
Touch were particularly successful. The category was boosted by strong growth
in the emerging markets. The launch of NIVEA Creme Care and Original Care
was a significant growth driver for NIVEA Shower. Growth at NIVEA Body came
from the successful expansion of the In-Shower product range.

Overall, we gained market share in our core categories and a large majority of
our key markets. In the NIVEA Deo category, we extended our market share in
particular in Brazil and Australia. Growth in Brazil, Russia and Spain had a
positive impact on our market share in the NIVEA Men category. In contrast, our
market share in the NIVEA Sun category experienced a negative trend, with
year-on-year declines in Switzerland, Germany, and Italy in particular. At the
country level, our market share showed a particularly positive trend in Japan,
Australia, Spain, and Brazil, whereas Poland experienced a negative develop-
ment.

Our Eucerin brand generated organic growth of 6.0%. The Eucerin Body Care
and the Eucerin Aquaphor categories made particularly strong contributions to
this positive performance. Sales growth in the USA, Thailand, and France was
particularly strong.

EUROPE

In the exclusive cosmetics segment, our La Prairie brand recorded an organic
increase in sales of 5.1%. Growth was driven in particular by the launch of the
Cellular Swiss Ice Crystal Collection and the continued positive performance of
the Skin Caviar Collection. Sales growth in the USA, China, Russia, and Japan
was particularly strong.

Results of operations in the European markets were very stable. Further invest-
ments in brand building and strengthening our position were made in the
emerging markets, even though this led to losses in some markets.

EBIT excluding special factors was €678 million (previous year: €638 million),
while the corresponding EBIT margin increased to 13.0% (previous year: 12.5%).

Sales in Western Europe rose 1.6% on the prior year. While strong sales growth
was achieved in Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom in particular, some of
the markets in this region were unable to repeat their prior-year performance.
Sales growth was largely due to our successful innovations. Sales of NIVEA
Shower and NIVEA Deo performed well. Eucerin also saw strong growth.

Sales in Eastern Europe rose by 3.6%. Growth was mainly driven by the healthy
trend in Russia, which recorded a rise in both sales and market share. In con-
trast, Poland experienced a decline in sales. La Prairie saw extremely strong

Organic sales by the tesa Business Segment were up 4.4% on the previous year.
Exchange rate effects reduced this figure by 0.8 percentage points. In nominal
terms, sales therefore rose by 3.6% to €1,076 million (previous year: €1,038
million). EBIT increased to €183 million (previous year: €176 million). The EBIT
margin was 17.0% (previous year: 16.9%).

tesa INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS

The industrial business performed very well in the past fiscal year, achieving or-
ganic sales growth of 4.5%. Both the direct customer business and the distribu-
tion business in all regions played a role in this. Business growth was significant
in Asia, the USA, and Europe. In nominal terms, sales rose by 3.8% to €793 mil-
lion (previous year: €764 million). The share of total sales accounted for by the
industrial business amounted to 73.7% (previous year: 73.6%).

In the electronics industry business, tesa again generated significant growth,
driven in particular by special adhesive strips and functional adhesive tapes.
These products are essential in the industrial manufacturing process for mobile
devices. For example, removable adhesive strips are used to mount batteries so
that they can be changed easily and quickly. Functional adhesive tapes are used
to shield and ground different voltages in the latest smartphones and tablets.

In the automotive area, there was a further increase from demand in Asia, North
and South America, and Europe. Laser technology-based identification systems
that are resilient against heat, abrasion, and chemicals - and that leave visible
traces if there is any attempt at tampering - were particularly successful. Tape die
cuts for hole covering in vehicle production also experienced high demand.
These customer-specific bonding solutions optimize the production process
and thus lower costs. tesa launched new products worldwide for cable fasten-
ing in vehicle interiors.

Sales of printing industry products showed encouraging growth. They were
driven in particular by new variants of tesa’s softprint solutions for flexographic
printing. These softprint products are used to secure the printing plates to the
printing cylinder. They are easy to fit and can be secured particularly soundly at
critical points, thus ensuring the quality of the printing process. At the same
time, these new product variants can now be removed more easily once the
printing process is complete.

In its new Pharma business area, tesa more than doubled sales in the area of
contract manufacturing of medicated plasters and fast-dissolving oral films, al-
beit from a still low base. New contracts were signed with customers, securing
additional sales potential for the coming years. Moreover, tesa recorded a re-
markable increase in order intake, both for development projects for patentable
original pharmaceuticals and for generics for well-known customers. The Phar-
ma business area’s Transfilm®, Rapidfilm®, and Mucofilm” technologies have been
well received by customers.

The consumer products and professional craftsmen business, which is focused
on Europe and Latin America, performed well, with organic sales growth of
4.6%. In nominal terms, sales increased by 3.6% to €257 million (previous
year: €248 million). As a result, the consumer business contributed 23.8% (pre-
vious year: 23.9%) of total sales by the tesa Business Segment in the period un-
der review.

tesa expanded its market share in the two strategic business areas making up
the consumer & craftsmen segment. This applied both to its DIY solutions and

Total non-current provisions and liabilities increased year-on-year to €773 mil-
lion (previous year: €612 million). This change was caused by two offsetting
effects. Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits rose to
€627 million (previous year: €388 million) due to the lower discount rate, while
deferred tax liabilities declined to €69 million (previous year: €134 million). To-
tal current provisions and liabilities rose by €136 million to €1,917 million (previ-
ous year: €1,781 million) as a result of an increase in trade payables due to oper-
ational factors. The equity ratio was 58% (previous year: 59%). Non-current lia-
bilities accounted for 12% (previous year: 10%) and current liabilities for 30%
(previous year: 31%).

Overall Assessment of the Group’s Economic

Position

Business developments in 2014 show that Beiersdorf is on the right track. The
Group’s two business segments performed extremely well. Both the Consumer
Business Segment and the tesa Business Segment recorded encouragingly
strong growth rates. Group sales amounted to €6,285 million (previous year:
€6,141 million). Organic growth amounted to 4.7% (previous year: 7.2%). After
adjustment for special factors, EBIT amounted to €861 million (previous year:
€814 million). The EBIT margin excluding special factors amounted to 13.7%
(previous year: 13.2%).

The Consumer Business Segment made successful progress thanks to the sys-
tematic implementation of the corporate strategy, which is based on the Blue
Agenda. This strategic compass aims to make Beiersdorf more competitive and
to enhance its economic success. Its success can be seen particularly in the per-
formance recorded by the emerging markets and the launch of new, high-selling
products.

The tesa Business Segment further expanded its business both in the industrial
markets and in the consumer business.

At 4.8%, sales growth in the Consumer Business Segment was in the middle of
the target range of 4-6% that was forecast for fiscal year 2014. The expansion
of our impact and presence in the emerging markets was a particular contribut-
ing factor. The operating result (EBIT, excluding special factors) and the EBIT
margin both increased in fiscal year 2014 as forecast.

The tesa Business Segment again recorded a positive performance in the past
fiscal year. With sales growth of 4.4%, tesa outperformed the forecasts, due in
particular to the healthy trend in the automotive and electronics growth mar-
kets. Expectations for the operating result (EBIT, excluding special factors) and
the EBIT margin were exceeded in fiscal year 2014.

Judgments by Management

No accounting policies were applied and no related options were exercised in
the consolidated financial statements that differ from those in prior years and
that, if applied or exercised differently, would have had a material effect on the
results of operations, net assets, and financial position. Information on the ef-
fects of the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments by management can
be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

LEADING-EDGE SKIN CARE EXPERTISE

Beiersdorf is globally known for its leading-edge skin care expertise. Beiersdorf's
scientists continually expand their knowledge of the complex skin processes
using the latest internal and external scientific findings.

Research and development activities focused on skin aging processes and the
development of ways to improve skin elasticity and firmness. The scientists dis-
covered two major aging forces. One relates to the importance of the interac-
tion between skin cells and the connective tissue (e.g. collagen) and skin aging.
The other is the role of the protein Periostin in the formation of collagen and the

Research and Development

effect of UV exposure on periostin activity, which in turn reduces collagen for-
mation and ultimately causes skin sagging.

Product safety and tolerability are of utmost importance. This is why Beiersdorf’s
scientists collaborate with external research groups to develop new methods of
monitoring skin sensitization and preventing side effects. In 2014, a research
consortium consisting of the Charité hospital in Berlin, a Berlin-based start-up,
and Beiersdorf created the first functioning model of skin and liver. This model
mimics the interaction between skin and liver cells by reproducing how sub-
stances are absorbed via the skin, transported by the blood, and broken down
by the liver. The skin/liver organ model is an important first step on the way to
producing a complex multi-organ model that could deliver an alternative toxic-
ity screening method in the future.

Beiersdorf’s scientists advance their research using pioneering scientific meth-
odologies that push the limits of visualization and measurements of the skin and
its properties. One good example is overcoming the limits of conventional mi-
croscopy by collaborating with Dr. Stefan Hell, the renowned Nobel Prize winner
for Chemistry.

IN-DEPTH DIALOG WITH EXTERNAL INNOVATORS

Beiersdorf’s Research and Development unit has integrated third-party knowl-
edge since its inception. The Open Innovation initiative allows the company to
involve leading research institutes, universities, and suppliers in its research and
development activities at an early stage. Open Innovation combines two ap-
proaches:

© Technology scouting, a targeted search for ideas and solutions for Beiersdorf’s
unsolved research and development problems.

© The Pearlfinder initiative, launched in 2011. Researchers, institutes, and com-
panies can present innovations ona secure online platform. This initiative en-
ables Beiersdorf to build relationships with a growing number of new part-
ners from a variety of industry sectors.

Pearlfinder staged the first Beiersdorf Innovation Pitch in 2014. This competi-
tion, organized in cooperation with the “in-cosmetics” trade fair, resulted in pro-
posals from 67 exhibitors. The winning three ideas became active development
projects for Beiersdorf and its chosen partners.

Further information on Pearlfinder can be found at
WWW.PEARLFINDER.BEIERSDORF.COM.

EXPANSION OF REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT LABORATORIES

In order to get even closer to consumers in its relevant markets, Beiersdorf
continued its systematic regionalization of its production and development
activities. In 2014, Beiersdorf expanded the Far East development laboratory in
Wuhan, China, opened a new laboratory in Silao, Mexico, to meet the growing
demand in the Latin American region, and laid the foundations for a new regional
laboratory in Sanand, India, that will open in 2015.

RECOGNIZING AND MEETING CONSUMERS’ NEEDS
Beiersdorf’s top priority is to fulfill consumers’ needs and ensure their safety.

* Registered trademark of SYMRISE, Germany

For this purpose, Beiersdorf uses state-of-the-art consumer research methods.
The data and information gathered from consumer feedback are used to sup-
plement the company’s scientific work when developing new products and
adapting them to meet regional conditions and requirements. All products are
subjected to intensive safety and efficacy testing before they are launched on
the market. In the year under review, Beiersdorf conducted about 1,600 studies
with approximately 36,000 participants in all regions.

INNOVATIONS.

The Consumer Business Segment filed patents for 76 innovations in the year un-
der review (previous year: 65) and its products repeatedly set significant new
market trends. Key 2014 innovations included the following:

© NIVEA Q10 plus Anti-Wrinkle Serum Pearls: The use of this product’s innova-
tive pearl technology helps replenish the skin’s own QI0 stores. The pearls’
formula combines coenzyme QI10, hyaluronic acid, and creatine - three ingre-
dients that are naturally present in skin - in a hydrogel suspension. The pat-
ented serum formula is freshly activated on dispensing the product: The
pearls melt into the hydrogel to form a highly effective anti-aging serum that
takes active anti-wrinkle skin care to a whole new level.

© NIVEA In-Shower products are among the most popular body care products.
New varieties were added to the successful product range in 2014, including
In-Shower Soft Milk and In-Shower Body Lotion Cocoa Indulging. To meet
specific consumer needs in Asia, additionally two In-Shower Whitening prod-
ucts were launched.

°

NIVEA Sun In-Shower Refreshing After Sun Lotion offers an innovative way
to nourish and refresh the skin directly in the shower after sunbathing. The
formula with cucumber extract supplies long-lasting moisture to skin
stressed by exposure to the sun’s rays, leaving it feeling refreshed and silky
but non-sticky.

© Beiersdorf’s Eucerin Sensitive Skin In-Shower Body Lotion is the first prod-
uct of its kind in the pharmacy market. It was specially developed for sensi-
tive skin. Used daily in the shower, its mild fragrance-free formula with 5%
dexpanthenol strengthens the skin’s natural protection. The result is easy-to-
use sensitive skin care with an immediate moisturizing effect that makes the
skin feel pleasantly soft.

© The products in the new Eucerin UltraSENSITIVE care range have been spe-
cially developed to treat hypersensitive facial skin. The formulas containing
the innovative active ingredient SymSitive* have an immediate, long-lasting
effect on unpleasant feelings of stinging or itchiness. The formulas are pre-
servative-, alcohol-, and fragrance-free, soothe the skin, and strengthen its
protective function. Special anti-contamination vacuum packaging provides
additional protection for the pure formulas in the product range.

wounds 100% dry during washing and showering, bathing and swimming.
The plaster’s waterproof backing material is flexible and adapts itself to
movement, so that it is very comfortable to wear. The new, especially strong
adhesive material reliably protects the skin against water in particular, so that
wounds can heal freely.

SOLVENT-FREE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES

In fiscal year 2014, research at tesa continued to focus on solvent-free manufac-
turing processes for adhesive tapes. tesa developed a process that allows reac-
tive components to be incorporated into adhesive tapes without the need for
solvents. These reactive adhesive tapes reach the required strength even at
very low temperatures. This process, followed by subsequent hardening, means
that it is now possible to bond even sensitive plastics and coated materials that
previously could not be processed at normal temperatures.

ADHESIVE MASSES FOR TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS.
Technological progress in mobile devices is leading to more stringent require-
ments for speaker membranes in smartphones and tablet PCs. In response, tesa
developed laminates in fiscal year 2014 which combine outstanding acoustics
with a long product life by bonding together multiple layers of special films with
new types of adhesive masses that have special damping properties. In addi-
tion, mobile phone solutions were developed that stop housings from coming
apart even when the phone is dropped and prevent water penetration.

ADHESIVE TAPES WITH ECOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

Products with special ecological properties require adhesive tapes that also
possess the same properties. For example, new adhesive masses for use in com-
postable packaging systems were created in tesa’s laboratories in the year un-
der review. These can be combined with compostable film substrates to form a
high-performance adhesive tape.

INNOVATIVE ADHESIVE TAPE SYSTEMS FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE
INDUSTRY

Modern design technologies such as those employed in automotive engineering
use materials that offer improved strength with less weight. However, traditional
bonding techniques such as welding are no longer suitable for some of these
materials. tesa has developed adhesive tape system technologies that can be
used in supporting structures and that meet customers’ requirements for
strength, combinations of materials, and lightweight construction processes.
These innovations are already being tested in initial concept studies for new car
models.

Sustainability

For Beiersdorf, “care” is a core value and part of its core business. This encom-
passes not only skin care and protection, but also responsibility towards our fel-
low human beings and our environment. Sustainability is a living component of
Beiersdorf’s corporate culture and is strategically anchored in all its business
processes. Beiersdorf’s goal is to continue to combine success and responsibility.

Consumer

CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY

The “We care.” sustainability strategy that Beiersdorf developed in 2011 focus-
es on the following fields of activity: “Products,” “Planet,” and “People.” The
company has defined clear, long-term objectives for each field of activity. By
2020, Beiersdorf aims to:

© generate 50% of its sales from products with a significantly reduced environ-
mental impact (base year 2011),

© have reduced its CO, emissions by 30% per product sold (base year 2005),
© reach and improve the lives of one million families (base year 2013).

In 2014, Beiersdorf continued to drive forward the implementation of projects in
all three strategic areas throughout the company.

For example, Beiersdorf introduced a new global sustainability management
system - “susy” (sustainability system) - in the year under review to measure
progress towards its ambitious sustainability goals on an even broader basis
and to facilitate reporting in accordance with GRI (Global Reporting Initiative)
standards, among other things. Efficient and transparent data management en-
ables Beiersdorf to respond dynamically to and accommodate constantly
changing stakeholder demands, new European directives, and developments in
the field of sustainability. In addition, improved control mechanisms ensure that
these are optimally integrated with its internal processes.

PRODUCTS

Beiersdorf uses life cycle assessments (LCAs) to measure and reduce the envi-
ronmental impact associated with each stage of the product life cycle. The as-
sessment model complies with the independent ISO standards for LCAs (14040
and 14044) and covers raw materials, in-house manufacturing processes, trans-
portation, product use, recycling, and disposal.

Beiersdorf made important progress in the year under review using LCAs: The
new packaging for NIVEA Face Care products achieves CO, savings throughout
the entire product life cycle since the jars are made out of two plastics, polyeth-
ylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP). The LCA found that switch-
ing from glass to PET reduces the product’s carbon footprint by up to 16%, and
switching from glass to PP by as much as 28%.

Beiersdorf has also made further progress in transitioning to sustainable palm
kernel oil. In addition to participating in the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil
(RSPO), the company is also active in the “Forum fiir nachhaltiges Palmél”


--- Page 16 ---

Beiersdorf Annual Report 2014 / Group Management Report / Research and Development
Sustainability

(FONAP - the German Forum for Sustainable Palm Oil). By 2020, Beiersdorf in-
tends to have converted the raw materials concerned to segregated or at least
mass balanced palm (kernel) oil and derivatives. Until the changeover is com-
plete, it will offset the share of raw materials that have not yet been converted
with Green Palm certificates.

PLANET

In 2014, Beiersdorf rolled out a software program to calculate and manage its
logistics emissions in Europe. The software is linked to susy, the new sustaina-
bility management system. Among other functions, it presents emissions for
annual reporting purposes in accordance with the GRI and the Carbon Disclo-
sure Project (CDP).

The new factory in Silao (Mexico) was awarded platinum Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, the highest sustainability stand-
ard for buildings, in the year under review. So far, only four production facilities
worldwide have received platinum certification - the one in Silao is the only one
to date in the Latin American region and the only one to date in the cosmetics
industry. Beiersdorf aims to achieve gold LEED certification for the expansion of
its factories in Chile and Thailand. The company has also been extending its
“Blue Production Center” initiative to its production facilities in the Far East
since 2013. The initiative focuses on energy and water efficiency, water treat-
ment, and waste management.

Water is an increasingly scarce resource, not least in light of climate change and
global population growth. This is why Beiersdorf attaches great importance to
using water efficiently in its business activities and to continually reducing its
water consumption. Unlike CO, emissions, water consumption is a regional is-
sue. Some regions of the world do not have adequate access to drinking water.
Beiersdorf has therefore launched its first local projects to assess water supply
system risk and to implement appropriate measures.

PEOPLE

Beiersdorf aims to further improve workplace safety and to reduce the number
of work-related accidents with its company-wide “zero accidents” initiative. For
example, behavioral based safety (BBS) principles are being drawn up to make
employees aware of possible sources of danger in the workplace and safe work-
ing practices - such as by defining clear behavioral patterns expressed in terms
of “I will” and “I will not” rules. The concept was extended to include additional
countries in 2014.

NIVEA supports families all over the world with long-term, locally relevant pro-
jects through its global “NIVEA cares for family” initiative. The initiative focuses
on three areas:

© developing children’s skills,
© supporting mothers,
© giving families the opportunity to spend time with each other.

The idea of strengthening families reflects Beiersdorf’s tradition of social en-
gagement and the core values of all of Beiersdorf’s brands, especially NIVEA.

Children’s experiences in the first few years of life are central to their develop-
ment. NIVEA Brazil has launched a partnership with children’s charity Plan Inter-
national that aims to help around 85,000 families in Brazil by 2020. Among oth-
er measures, the initiative offers workshops for parents on topics such as moti-
vation, and gives women the opportunity to obtain advice on income security.
It is also building recreational facilities to encourage families to play together.
Many of these projects are being supported by NIVEA volunteers. The partner-
ship is scheduled to last for seven years and is initially starting in Sao Paulo and
Itatiba before being extended to northeast Brazil. It will be reviewed annually
for efficiency and sustainability.

Hansaplast/Elastoplast cooperates with local Red Cross organizations around
the world to strengthen everyday first aid under the motto “Bringing First Aid
Home.” Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands, Aus-
tria, and Spain are already participating in the initiative. Hansaplast has been
working with the German Red Cross since September 2014 under the motto “Er-
ste Klasse - Erste Hilfe” (“First Grade - First Aid”). The partnership aims to fa-
miliarize elementary school children with basic first aid measures and to foster
a desire to help at an early age.

HIGH LEVEL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

In 2014, tesa’s priorities were again to make a significant contribution to social
development and to enhance the company’s environmental management sys-
tem. tesa has been systematically establishing its environmental management
system since 2001 and regularly exceeds its environmental protection goals. For
example, its production locations around the world have cut emissions of vola-
tile organic compounds (VOCs) by more than half since 2001 and have signifi-
cantly reduced the amount of waste produced, CO, emissions, and solvent us-
age. All of the company’s production facilities are certified in accordance with
ISO 14001, the international environmental standard.

tesa’s environmental management activities continued to focus on reducing en-
ergy consumption and CO, emissions in the year under review. Energy manage-
ment at tesa’s Hamburg and Offenburg locations was boosted by the installa-
tion of state-of-the-art energy monitoring systems. Offenburg has generated its
own environmentally friendly electricity from a combined heat and power plant
since July 2014, and Hamburg is expected to follow suit starting in 2015. The
energy management systems at both locations are to be certified according to
ISO 50001 in the first quarter of 2015.

tesa actively identifies and determines the ecological value drivers in the pro-
duction process. The eco-balance method is used to analyze the environmental
impact of individual products throughout their life cycle in order to further en-
hance their environmental compatibility. In the process, tesa constantly search-
es for more environmentally friendly alternatives for certain product compo-
nents or packaging.

SPONSORSHIP OF UNESCO BIOSPHERE RESERVE AND
COOPERATION IN SOCIAL PROJECTS

tesa completely refocused its social engagement in the year under review fol-
lowing an employee survey. The company provides donations, financial sup-
port, and sponsorship under the motto “tesa connects.” In addition, employees
support charitable projects outside of their day-to-day work: In 2014, tesa em-
ployees contributed to social causes (“tesa helps” and “tesa donates”), educa-
tion (“tesa fosters”), and environmental protection (“tesa protects”):

© For example, “tesa helps” aids social causes by supporting social, environ-
mental, and cultural organizations in cooperation with the Hamburg associa-
tion “Initiative tatkraftig e.V.” Seven teams with a total of around 100 employ-
ees participated in this initiative in 2014.

© “tesa donates” contributes to causes such as Typhoon Haiyan in the Philip-
pines or the “Heroes Race” (“Course de Héros”) in France with donations in
kind and with money.

© Under “tesa fosters,” the company contributes its technical expertise for ed-
ucational purposes by cooperating with the “Initiative Naturwissenschaft
und Technik” (Science and Technology Initiative, NAT). tesa’s experts give
pupils in Hamburg an insight into different vocational fields and career paths
at the company.

© Under “tesa protects,” tesa volunteers help to protect the UNESCO biosphere
reserve in Lower Saxony’s Elbe Valley as part of a long-term partnership
(corporate volunteering). tesa employees are helping to maintain this highly
biodiverse, environmentally sensitive floodplain landscape with a range of
activities.

All tesa’s activities are documented in an annual progress report that is availa-
ble at WWW.TESA.COM/RESPONSIBILITY.

ONE TEAM WHERE EVERYONE COUNTS

The Beiersdorf Group employed 17,398 people worldwide at the end of 2014
(previous year: 16,708). Of this figure, 5,860 (previous year: 5,696) or 34%
(previous year: 34%) were employed in Germany. 13,317 people worked in the
Consumer Business Segment (previous year: 12,890), and 4,081 in the tesa
Business Segment (previous year: 3,818).

THREE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF GLOBAL PEOPLE PRACTICES
Beiersdorf’s Human Resources practices follow three basic operating principles.
Firstly, the continuous strengthening of global HR standards and processes.
Secondly, the delegation of decision-making to the lowest possible level, en-
couraging local HR professionals to take ownership and initiative. Thirdly, build-
ing and sustaining a long-term trustful relationship with the company’s employ-
ees and their representatives.

STRENGTHENING THE FUNDAMENTALS OF AN ENGAGING
WORKING ENVIRONMENT

The Blue Agenda emphasizes the importance of the people at Beiersdorf for the
company’s long-term success: they manage strong brands, develop innovative
products and inspire consumers around the world. Therefore, strengthening an
engaging working environment remained a top priority also in 2014, including
the following focus areas:

Introducing Beiersdorf’s Core Values as long-term company culture project
Sustaining the efforts to foster an open feedback culture

Extending diversity engagement

Supporting company-wide social collaboration

Improving Beiersdorf’s global talent management system

Introducing a new leadership development architecture

INTRODUCING BEIERSDORF’S CORE VALUES ASA

LONG-TERM COMPANY CULTURE PROJECT

Beiersdorf’s four Core Values - Care, Simplicity, Courage and Trust - are deep-
ly rooted in its more than 130 years of corporate history. The employees’ high
level of identification with these values provides an excellent opportunity to de-
bate, review, and improve leadership quality and management effectiveness.
2014 marked the starting year of this long-term culture project with the active
participation of all units and all employees. The Core Values have also already
been incorporated into Beiersdorf’s continuous Employee Dialog process and
its global leadership development programs.

SUSTAINING THE EFFORTS TO FOSTER AN OPEN

FEEDBACK CULTURE

Beiersdorf conducted its global employee engagement survey for the second
time in 2014. This year, a record 92% of employees took part in the survey and
the overall employee engagement index increased significantly against the
previous year. Results were openly presented throughout the company and
discussed in more than 1,000 teams, with follow-up activities being facilitated
and their implementation monitored by the local HR departments.

EXTENDING DIVERSITY ENGAGEMENT

Diversity is a strong asset that contributes to Beiersdorf’s global success.
In 2014, Beiersdorf continued its systematic global diversity action program
launched in 2013.

On gender diversity, Beiersdorf’s mentoring and networking programs promot-
ing women’s career development continued into a second wave. In practice, the
first examples of job sharing at managerial level have been progressing suc-
cessfully. Beiersdorf is well on its way to increasing the percentage of women in
management positions in Germany to 30% by 2020: At the end of 2014, this
figure stood at 27.5% (previous year: 25.5%).

On international diversity, Beiersdorf further increased the number of inter-
national employees at its Hamburg headquarters to 13% by the end of 2014
(previous year: 12%). The number of senior managers with international experi-
ence remained on a high level: about half of them have long-term overseas
working experience.

SUPPORTING COMPANY-WIDE SOCIAL COLLABORATION
In 2013, Beiersdorf created BluePlanet - an internal platform for communication
and collaboration that makes cross-border and cross-functional teamwork
more efficient. In its first full year, BluePlanet has already become a vital part of
employees’ work life, with an average of 6,000 active users per month.

IMPROVING BEIERSDORF’S GLOBAL TALENT

MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Global talent management is a strategic priority: talent and people develop-
ment is an integral part of every Executive Board meeting. Talent development
at Beiersdorf consists of a variety of face-to-face exchanges such as coaching,
mentoring, or round table events. In addition, annual “Talent Days” are held in
which young executives discuss current business issues directly with the Exec-
utive Board. In 2014, process integration was the centerpiece of improvement
initiatives: Firstly, the integration of all essential aspects of career development
into one documented process chain covering performance, potential, individual
development, and career planning. Secondly, the integration of local, regional,
and global activities, creating a single, streamlined global process.

INTRODUCING A NEW LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT
ARCHITECTURE

Beiersdorf’s leadership development concept consists of on-the-job learning,
mentoring and coaching, and classroom training elements. It puts particular
emphasis on authenticity and self-reflection, decoding leadership into the man-
agement of human relationships. In 2014, two newly-designed development
programs were launched in conjunction with the Core Value initiative: a “Base
Camp” for first-time leaders and a “Step-up Camp” for middle and senior level
managers. Both programs combine face-to-face modules with complementary
coaching and experiential learning in-between over a total period of six months,
and also closely involve the participants’ team leaders.

PEOPLE-ORIENTED WORKFORCE MANAGEGEMENT
DAY-BY-DAY

Throughout 2014, many remarkable local and regional people initiatives
brought Beiersdorf’s philosophy of care and trust to life. In view of the high
youth unemployment rate in southern Europe, Beiersdorf set up a program to
hire 30 young academics in addition to its business plan. More than 70% of this
group were offered permanent contracts in 2014 to continue their work. Many
countries were hit hard by economic, political, and public health crises in 2014.
Beiersdorf was able to maintain a high level of organizational stability in these
cases through responsive and responsible HR practice. In Wuhan, China, Beiersdorf
further extended its regional development capacities. In Brazil, Beiersdorf was
one of the country’s TOP 150 employers” for the third year in a row. In Mexico,
the construction of a new production facility and the relocation of the existing
plant from Vallejo to Silao affecting more than 900 employees, was successfully
completed. In Germany, 30 students out of about 400 applicants from all over
Europe came to Hamburg in November 2014 to participate in Beiersdorf’s first
“International Internship Challenge” for three fully sponsored internship positions
at Beiersdorf affiliates worldwide. This marked a successful shift towards a new
approach in communicating with young talents: Instead of simply giving presen-
tations on university campuses, Beiersdorf opens its offices, labs, canteen, and
kindergarten and establishes an open dialog between employees and students.

tesa KEY COMPETENCIES MODEL

The focus of Human Resources work in the year under review was the launch of
the new competency model. For the first time this took the form of a uniform
competency model for all tesa employees and managers worldwide that will
serve as the basis for recruitment, training, succession planning, and promotion
in the future. It was developed with extensive international involvement from
many employees and was met with great interest across the company. tesa in-
tends to use the model to further professionalize succession planning and to
promote and enhance the company’s open culture in line with the tesa Strategy
2020. Together with its employees, tesa identified the key competencies re-
quired in order to achieve its corporate goals going forward and to clearly dif-
ferentiate tesa from the competition. In order to ensure that these new ideas are
also incorporated into employee management, the competency model will be
integrated into the annual employee dialog worldwide.

TALENT MANAGEMENT AND SUCCESSION PLANNING

Under the heading of “inpat management” - part of its internationalization pol-
icy - tesa aims to enable a growing number of high flyers from its international
affiliates to learn about tesa’s corporate culture at Group headquarters for a pe-
riod of six months to three years. Employees receive a systematic program fea-
turing comprehensive support and culture-specific induction, so that they
quickly adapt to the different conditions at their new workplace and place of
residence. The number of employees who are taking advantage of or are inter-
ested in this offer is rising all the time, and the feedback from the program is ex-
tremely positive.

CONSTRUCTION OF NEW tesa HEADQUARTERS

In the year under review, tesa SE’s employees in Hamburg prepared for the up-
coming move to the company’s newly constructed headquarters in Norder-
stedt, which also features an integrated research and technology center (the
“one tesa” project). The move is scheduled to take place in 2015 and is a mile-
stone in the company’s long-term growth. Consolidating the business units and
the Research and Development function in a single space should significantly
contribute to tesa’s ability to respond more quickly and flexibly to market re-
quirements from 2015 onwards. A large number of design details regarding the
new working environment were agreed with employee representatives in the
year under review. The design and layout of the building was based on a mod-
ern employer branding concept, which positions tesa as an attractive employer.

Risk

Report

Integrated Risk and Opportunity Management

Entrepreneurial success cannot be achieved without consciously taking risks.
Risk management helps us to master the risks associated with the strategic
objectives of the business and to maximize our strategic potential. Regular
strategy reviews ensure that opportunities and risks are reasonably balanced.
We incur risks only if there is a corresponding opportunity for an appropriate in-
crease in value and if they can be managed using established methods and
measures within our organization. Relevant risks are identified and captured in
a structured manner. They are classified based on the estimated probability of
occurrence and the potential financial impact if they were to occur.

Risk management is an integral part of central and local planning, management,
and control processes, and conforms to consistent standards across the Group.
Our open communications policy, the risk inventory carried out at regular inter-
vals, and the planning and management system ensure that our risk situation is
presented transparently. Risk management is coordinated at Group headquar-
ters. Our risk management structures and workflows are documented in a ded-
icated manual.

Accounting-related Internal Control System

An accounting-related internal control system is used to ensure the correctness
of the bookkeeping and accounting as well as the reliability of the financial re-
porting in the consolidated financial statements and the Group Management
Report. This integral element of the consolidated accounting process compris-
es preventive, monitoring, and detective measures designed to ensure security
and control in accounting and the operational functions. The security measures
and controls reduce the probability of errors occurring and uncover any that are
made at an early stage. Among other things, the measures include the separa-
tion of functions, manual and IT-based approval processes using the dual con-
trol principle, IT checks, access restrictions and authorization concepts for the
IT system, and systems-based processes for handling Group accounting data.
Procedural instructions, standardized reporting formats, and IT-based report-
ing and consolidation processes support Group accounting and financial report-
ing for the companies included in the consolidated financial statements.

Shared service centers provide uniform processing of the core accounting pro-
cesses at Beiersdorf AG and most of its affiliates. The basic principles and pro-
cesses and the reporting structure for Group accounting are documented in an
accounting and financial contro! manual. Legislation, accounting standards, and
pronouncements are analyzed for their relevance and impact and taken into ac-
count as necessary.

Independent Monitoring

Our Internal Audit department - which serves as the Executive Board’s financial
control function - monitors risk management and the internal control system by
means of systematic and regular audits. The department is independent of the
Group's operating activities, and uses a risk-based approach to reviewing our
business processes and the systems and controls we have put in place. In addi-
tion, the external auditors audit the risk early warning and monitoring system.
Both the Internal Audit department and the external auditors regularly report
their audit findings to the Supervisory Board and in particular to its Audit Com-
mittee.

Our Risk Profile

STRATEGIC AND SECTOR-SPECIFIC RISKS

Maintaining and increasing the value of our major consumer brands with their
broad appeal is of central importance for Beiersdorf’s business development.
We have geared our risk management system towards protecting the value of
our brands. Our compliance with high standards of product quality and safety is
the basis for our consumers’ continued trust in our brands. We therefore per-
form in-depth safety assessments, which take into account consumer feedback
on earlier products, when developing new products. Our products are subject
to the strict criteria of our quality management system throughout the entire
procurement, production, and distribution process.

Innovations based on strong research and development are a precondition for
consumer acceptance of our products, and for the latter’s appeal. Prudent
brand management captures consumer trends as well as the results of in-depth
market and competitive analyses, and at the same time ensures that the brand's
core remains intact and is carefully enhanced.

Strong brands that balance innovation and continuity are our response to fierce
global competition on price, quality, and innovation. We have laid the ground-
work for identifying consumer wishes and reflecting them in the products we
develop even faster by developing and implementing the “Consumer Insights”
process. This also counteracts the growing retail concentration and the regional
emergence of private label products.

Since expertise-based brands require a high degree of upfront investment in in-
novation and marketing, the continuous expansion of our trademark and patent
portfolio plays a key role. In particular, the systematic registration and enforce-
ment of our intellectual property rights prevents imitations and counterfeiting
of our products, and thus helps safeguard and further increase the earnings po-
tential previously created. Third-party intellectual property rights are identified
and respected when developing new products.

Our management focus on the long-term success of our market activities en-
sures that we invest in promising markets in terms of both products and regions.
At the same time, we ensure that we are generating the funds needed for this in
the long term.

SUPPLY CHAIN AND IT RISKS

We counter procurement risks relating to the availability and price of raw mate-
rials, merchandise, and services by continuously monitoring our markets and
suppliers and ensuring active management of our supplier portfolio, as well as
by appropriate contract management. Procurement strategies are reviewed
regularly and adjusted to reflect internal and external requirements. We counter
compliance risks by providing clear management structures and through effi-
cient organizational measures. Occupational safety, environmental, and busi-
ness interruption risks in our production and logistics activities are minimized
by process control checks and location-specific audits. We minimize risks relat-
ing to the availability, reliability, and efficiency of our IT systems through contin-
uous monitoring and improvements, as well as through the establishment of
acontinuity management system that is an integrated part of our IT operations.
We counter selected risks by transferring them to insurance companies.

Cooperation and contacts with universities enable us to build early links to qual-
ified new employees, for whom we have special trainee programs to prepare
them for a career at Beiersdorf. Our uniform global talent management process

41

identifies and develops talented specialists and management personnel at all
levels and supports the appointment of qualified staff in key positions through-
out the company as these become vacant.

FINANCIAL RISKS

We counter the risk of bad debts through detailed monitoring of our customer
relationships, active receivables management, and the selective use of trade
credit insurance.

Currency, interest rate, and liquidity risks are subject to active treasury manage-
ment based on global guidelines. They are managed and hedged centrally to a
very large extent, whereby the specific requirements for the organizational sep-
aration of the trading, settlement, and controlling functions are taken into ac-
count. Derivative financial instruments serve primarily to hedge operational ac-
tivities and financial transactions essential to the business. They do not expose
the Group to any material additional risks.

We limit currency risks from intragroup deliveries of goods and services using
currency forwards. Generally, 75% of forecasted annual net cash flows are
hedged (cash flow hedges on forecasted transactions). Currency risks from
cross-border intragroup financing are generally hedged in the market by the
central Treasury department using currency forwards.

Potential default risks relating to the investment of the Group’s liquid funds are
limited by only making investments with defined, reliable counterparties. Coun-
terparty risk is monitored on the basis of ratings and the counterparties’ liable
capital as well as continuously updated risk indicators. These parameters are
used to determine maximum amounts for investments with partner banks and
securities issuers (counterparty limits), which are compared regularly with the
investments actually made throughout the Group. We have invested the major-
ity of our liquidity in low-risk investments (such as government/corporate
bonds and Pfandbriefe).

We use liquidity concentration methods and tools at our affiliates in order to op-
timally manage our investments. Appropriate systems ensure we have transpar-
ency concerning our affiliates’ remaining funds. Positive balances are registered
with central counterparty risk management. Our financial risk management is
characterized by the clear allocation of responsibilities, central rules for limiting
financial risks as a matter of principle, and the conscious alignment of the instru-
ments deployed with the requirements of our business activities.

Further information on the extent of the currency, interest rate, default, and
liquidity risks described above can be found in Note 27 of the consolidated
financial statements, “Additional Disclosures on Financial Instruments, Financial
Risk Management, and Derivative Financial Instruments.”

LEGAL RISKS

Along with other international companies, the Beiersdorf Consumer Business
Segment’s Brazilian affiliates are involved in tax proceedings on a national level.
However, no conclusive assessment of the risk from the Group perspective is
possible at present.

External tax audits can result in additional tax payments at individual compa-
nies, potentially with additional financial penalties and interest payments.

Further information on the extent of the legal risks described above can be
found in Note 28 of the consolidated financial statements, “Contingent Liabili-
ties, Other Financial Obligations, and Legal Risks.”

Overall Assessment of the Group’s Risk Situation

Our assessment of the risk situation is the result of our examination of all mate-
rial individual risks listed above. There have been no structural changes in the
risk situation compared with the previous year. Based on our current assess-
ment, the Beiersdorf Group is not exposed to any risks that could endanger its
continued existence.

Report by the Executive
Board on Dealings among
Group Companies

In accordance with § 312 Aktiengesetz (German Stock Corporation Act, AktG),
the Executive Board has issued a report on dealings among Group companies
which contains the following concluding declaration: “According to the circum-
stances known to us at the time the transactions were executed or measures
were taken or not taken, Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft received appropriate
consideration for every transaction and has not been disadvantaged by the fact
that measures were taken or not taken.”

Report on Post-Balance
Sheet Date Events

No significant events occurred after the end of the fiscal year.

Disclosures Required
by Takeover Law

The disclosures required under § 315 (4) Hande/lsgesetzbuch (German Commer-
cial Code, HGB) are presented below.

Please refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the disclo-
sures on the composition of the subscribed capital and the disclosures on direct
or indirect interests in the share capital exceeding 10% of the voting rights. In
addition to this Michael Herz, Germany, has informed the Executive Board that
further shares in Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft are attributable to him and that
he directly holds shares in Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft. In total, the share of
voting rights held by Michael Herz in Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft amounts to
60.69% (including 9.99% own shares held by Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft,
which do not bear voting or dividend rights).

The appointment and removal from office of members of the Executive Board
are governed by §§ 84 and 85 Aktiengesetz (German Stock Corporation Act,
AktG), § 31 Mitbestimmungsgesetz (German Codetermination Act, MitbestG),
and § 7 of the Articles of Association. In accordance with § 7 of the Articles of
Association, the Executive Board consists of at least three persons; apart from
this provision, the Supervisory Board determines the number of members of the
Executive Board. The Articles of Association may be amended in accordance
with §§ 179 and 133 AktG and with § 16 of the Articles of Association. Under § 16
of the Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board is authorized to resolve
amendments and additions to the Articles of Association that concern the lat-
ter’s wording only. Under § 5 (6) of the Articles of Association, the Supervisory
Board is authorized in particular to amend and reformulate § 5 of the Articles of
Association (Share Capital) following each utilization of authorized or contin-
gent capital.

The Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2010, authorized the Executive Board,
with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the share capital in the
period until April 28, 2015, by up to a total of €92 million (Authorized Capital |:
€42 million; Authorized Capital II: €25 million; Authorized Capital II: €25 mil-
lion) by issuing new no-par-value bearer shares on one or several occasions. In
this context, the dividend rights for new shares may be determined by a differ-
ent method than that set out in § 60 (2) AktG.

Shareholders shall be granted preemptive rights. However, the Executive Board
is authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to disapply share-
holders’ preemptive rights in the following cases:

1. to eliminate fractions created as a result of capital increases against cash
contributions (Authorized Capital |, II, II!);

2. to the extent necessary to grant the holders/creditors of convertible bonds
or bonds with warrants issued by Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft or companies
in which it holds a direct or indirect majority interest, rights to subscribe for
new shares in the amount to which they would be entitled after exercising
their conversion or option rights, or after fulfilling their conversion obligation
(Authorized Capital |, II, II);

w

. if the total amount of share capital attributable to the new shares for which
preemptive rights are to be disapplied does not exceed 10% of the share cap-
ital existing at the time this authorization comes into effect or, in the event
that this amount is lower, at the time the new shares are issued and the issue
price of the new shares is not materially lower than the quoted market price
of the existing listed shares at the time when the issue price is finalized, which
should be as near as possible to the time the shares are placed. In the context
of the restriction of this authorization to a total of 10% of the share capital,
those shares must be included for which the preemptive rights of sharehold-
ers have been disapplied since April 29, 2010, in accordance with § 186 (3)
sentence 4 AktG when the authorization to sell own shares is utilized and/or
when the authorization to issue convertible bonds and/or bonds with war-
rants is utilized (Authorized Capital II);

4. in the case of capital increases against non-cash contributions, for the pur-
pose of acquiring companies, business units of companies, or equity interests
in companies (Authorized Capital III).

Report on Expected Developments

The Executive Board was also authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory
Board, to determine the further details of the capital increase and its implemen-
tation.

In addition, the Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2010, resolved to contin-
gently increase the share capital by up to a total of €42 million, composed of up
to 42 million no-par-value bearer shares. The contingent capital increase will be
implemented only to the extent that:

1. the holders or creditors of conversion and/or option rights attached to con-
vertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants issued in the period until April 28,
2015, by Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft, or companies in which it holds a direct
or indirect majority interest, choose to exercise their conversion or option
rights, or

2. the holders or creditors of convertible bonds giving rise to a conversion obli-
gation issued in the period until April 28, 2015, by Beiersdorf Aktienge-
sellschaft, or companies in which it holds a direct or indirect majority inter-
est, comply with such obligation, and the contingent capital is required for
this in accordance with the terms and conditions of the bonds.

The new shares bear dividend rights from the beginning of the fiscal year in
which they are created as a result of the exercise of conversion or option rights,
or as a result of compliance with a conversion obligation.

The Executive Board was authorized to determine the further details of the im-
plementation of a contingent capital increase.

The Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2010, also authorized the company in
accordance with § 71 (1) no. 8 AktG to purchase own shares in the total amount
of up to 10% of the existing share capital in the period up to April 28, 2015. The
shares shall be purchased via the stock exchange or via a public purchase offer
addressed to all shareholders. The Annual General Meeting authorized the Ex-
ecutive Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to sell in whole or in
part the own shares purchased on the basis of the above-mentioned or a prior
authorization while disapplying the shareholders’ preemptive rights, including
in a way other than via the stock exchange or via a purchase offer to all share-
holders, to the extent that these shares are sold for cash at a price that does not
fall materially below the market price of the same class of shares of the compa-
ny at the time of the sale. The Executive Board was also authorized, with the ap-
proval of the Supervisory Board, to utilize the above-mentioned own shares in
whole or in part as consideration or partial consideration in the context of a
merger or the acquisition of companies, equity interests in companies (includ-
ing increases in equity interests), or business units of companies, while disap-
plying the preemptive rights of shareholders. Moreover, the Executive Board is
authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to utilize these own
shares in whole or in part, while disapplying the preemptive rights of sharehold-
ers, in order to satisfy the subscription and/or conversion rights from converti-
ble bonds and/or bonds with warrants issued by the company or companies in
which it holds a direct or indirect majority interest. Finally, the Executive Board
was authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to retire the
above-mentioned own shares without requiring an additional resolution by the
Annual General Meeting.

The creation of the authorized and contingent capital is intended to put the
company in the position of being able to react to growth opportunities and cap-
ital market situations quickly and flexibly. The authorization to purchase and uti-

Report on Expected
Develooments

Expected Macroeconomic Developments

The global economic situation looks set to see only moderate improvement in
2015. We expect that this trend will be driven mainly by the industrialized na-
tions, while growth in the emerging markets will continue to lose momentum.
Tapering of bond sales and a planned increase in key interest rates by the US
Federal Reserve, coupled with developments in the current crisis regions, are
causing substantial uncertainty as regards global economic growth.

In Europe, we expect growth in 2015 to be up slightly on the prior year. Since
the economic recovery in the eurozone is only progressing slowly, necessary
reforms and structural adjustments will continue to restrict the potential for
growth in some countries. Besides the uncertain effects of tapering by the US
Federal Reserve, factors that could put the recovery at risk include ongoing
high unemployment in many countries, the lack of appetite for reform in certain
European countries, and geopolitical unrest. Overall, we anticipate a relatively
muted trend due to the still weak economy in some countries.

In Germany, we expect growth to outstrip that in the rest of Europe in the com-
ing year, and that it will continue to be driven by consumer spending and in-
creasing investment as a result of the expansionary monetary policy.

We expect slightly higher growth in the United States economy in 2015. Con-
sumer spending is set to rise as a result of the further decline in unemployment.
The increased confidence of American companies and the favorable economic
environment are likely to be reflected in an increase in capital expenditure.
However, tapering of bond sales and the planned increase in interest rates are
a source of uncertainty for the economy and the financial markets.

In Japan, we expect growth to be on a level with the previous year. The Bank of
Japan's continued expansionary monetary policy and the cheap yen are likely to
have a positive impact on foreign trade.

In China, we expect growth to be down slightly on the prior-year level. Fiscal
policy and the uncertain effects of the social and environmental reforms that
have been announced are particular sources of uncertainty.

Conditions in the remaining emerging markets will probably be more challeng-
ing. In India, we expect to see slightly higher growth than in the previous year,
with continued high single-digit inflation. We anticipate slight growth in the
emerging markets of Southeast Asia. Given the highly protectionist tendencies
in many Latin American countries, particularly in Venezuela, Ecuador, and Ar-
gentina, developments are difficult to forecast for this area. The Russian econo-
my is being impacted by the fall in oil prices, the fall of the ruble, and the results
of sanctions.

Procurement Market Trends

Lower oil prices will cut purchase costs for the oil refining industries. However,
as the prices of the refined materials are most strongly affected by supply and
demand in their respective markets, we expect only a limited positive impact on
procurement costs. The current weakness of the euro on the currency market is
countering this trend slightly. In 2014, Beiersdorf stepped up its efforts across
all its functions to identify and implement cost reduction opportunities. These
activities will be continued in 2015, with the aim of largely keeping purchase
costs constant.

Sales Market Trends

We believe that the global growth rate in the cosmetics market - the market
relevant for Beiersdorf - will remain at the prior-year level in 2015. We continue
to expect low but stable growth in the major European and North American
markets. The emerging markets will make a positive contribution to overall
performance, although momentum is likely to ease year-on-year.

Geopolitical risks and their impact on macroeconomic sentiment will dominate
tesa’s markets for the long term, especially in Europe. However, we expect sta-
ble growth in Europe overall, although the Ukraine conflict may continue to have
a negative effect on Eastern European markets in particular. By contrast, North
America is expected to gain significant momentum from the automotive indus-
try in particular, while the growth of the electronics industry in Asia should also
have a positive impact.

Our Market Opportunities

Market performance will remain mixed in 2015 and competition will continue to
increase in some markets. The corporate strategy set out in the Blue Agenda will
allow us to meet the challenges of tomorrow and hence to achieve our objec-
tives. We see strong opportunities both in systematically expanding our pres-
ence in the emerging markets and in consolidating our position in our European
markets. We aim to drive this process by strengthening our brands - especially
NIVEA, Eucerin, and La Prairie - and boosting our innovation power. This analysis
underpins our planning for 2015.

We will build on our sound financial structure and strong earnings position to-
gether with our dedicated and highly qualified employees to continue exploit-
ing future opportunities with our internationally successful brand portfolio. Ex-
tensive research and development activities resulting in successful, consum-
er-driven innovations will be flanked by targeted marketing measures, strength-
ening our brand core and creating enduring confidence among our consumers.

In tesa’s opinion its electronics industry business will remain attractive, with
significant growth rates predicted again for 2015. However, its project-based
nature means that the risks involved also remain. The automotive area will main-
tain its status as a second growth market for global customers. The Pharma
business will also continue to perform well.

Business Developments
Our assessment of business developments in the coming year is based on the
above assumptions.

In light of the macroeconomic forecasts, Beiersdorf is expecting sales growth in
the Consumer Business Segment to outperform the market in fiscal year 2015,
at 3-5%. A comparatively weak start to fiscal 2015 is expected given the strong
first quarter in 2014. The EBIT margin from operations is expected to slightly ex-
ceed the prior-year figure.

In the tesa business segment, we are also predicting sales growth of 3-5% for
2015. The EBIT margin from operations is expected to be slightly below the
prior-year level.

Building on the forecasts for the two business segments, we are expecting
Group sales to grow by 3-5%. The consolidated EBIT margin from operations
should slightly exceed the prior-year figure.

We firmly believe that we are well positioned for the future thanks to our inter-
nationally successful brand portfolio, our innovative and high-quality products,

and our dedicated employees.
