volume and 3% largest by revenue. The proposed combined company will be an industry leader with the
management, capabilities, resources and scale to successfully capitalize on the opportunities presented by the new
era in sustainable mobility.

The merged entity will benefit from an efficient governance structure designed to promote effective performance,
with a Board comprised of 11 members, the majority of whom will be independent. Five Board members will be
nominated by FCA and its reference shareholder (including John Elkann as Chairman) and five will be nominated
by Groupe PSA and its reference shareholders (including the Senior Non-Executive Director and the Vice
Chairman). Carlos Tavares will be Chief Executive Officer for an initial term of five years and will also be a member
of the board of directors.

The new group’s Dutch-domiciled parent company will be listed on Euronext (Paris), the Milan stock exchange
(Borsa Italiana -Milan) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and will benefit from its strong presence in
France, Italy and the U.S.

Under the proposed by-laws of the combined company, no shareholder would have the power to exercise more
than 30% of the votes cast at shareholders’ meetings. It is also foreseen that there will be no carryover of existing
double voting rights but that new double voting rights will accrue after a three-year holding period after completion
of the merger.

A standstill in respect of the shareholdings of EXOR, Bpifrance, Dongfeng Group (DFG) and the Peugeot Family
(EPF/FFP) will apply for a period of 7 years following completion of the merger, except that EPF/FFP will be
permitted to increase its shareholding by up to a maximum of 2.5% in the merged entity (or 5% at the Groupe PSA
level) by acquiring shares from Bpifrance and/or DFG and/or on the market.

EXOR, Bpifrance and EPF/FFP will be subject to a 3-year lock-up in respect of their shareholdings except that
Bpifrance will be permitted to reduce its shareholdings by 5% in Groupe PSA or 2.5% in the merged entity.

DFG has agreed to sell, and Groupe PSA has agreed to buy, 30.7 million shares prior to closing and those shares
will be cancelled. DFG will be subject to a lock-up until the completion of the transaction for the balance of its
participation in Groupe PSA, resulting in an ownership of 4.5% in the new group.

EXOR, Bpifrance, Peugeot Family and Dongfeng have each irrevocably committed to vote in favor of the
transaction at the shareholders’ meetings of FCA and Groupe PSA. Before closing, FCA will distribute to its
shareholders a special dividend of €5.5 billion while Groupe PSA will distribute to its shareholders its 46% stake in
Faurecia.
Each company intends to distribute a €1.1 billion ordinary dividend in 2020 related to fiscal year 2019, subject to
approval by each company’s board of directors and shareholders. At closing, Groupe PSA shareholders will
receive 1.742 shares of the new combined company for each share of Groupe PSA, while FCA shareholders will
have 1 share of the new combined company for each share of FCA.
The completion of the proposed combination is expected to take place in 12-15 months from the announcement of
the Combination Agreement, subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by both companies’
shareholders at their respective extraordinary general meetings and the satisfaction of antitrust and other
regulatory requirements.

EXOR’s credit ratings
On 19 December 2019 Standard & Poor’s affirmed EXOR’s long-term and short-term debt ratings at “BBB+” and

Net revenues

Net revenues of FCA for the year 2019 were €108,187 million with a decrease of €2,225 million compared to the
year 2018 (€110,412 million) primarily due to lower volumes in EMEA and Maserati, partially offset by a favorable
model mix and foreign exchange effect in North America.

Net revenues of CNH Industrial for the year 2019 were €25,033 substantially in line with the year 2018
(€25,179 million). The difference was the combined result of foreign currency translation and lower sales volume of
industrial activities.

Net revenues of PartnerRe, including the net gains on the investment portfolio, for the year 2019 were
€7,034 million, an increase of €2,340 million compared to the year of 2018 (€4,694 million), principally due to the
improvement of the result of the portfolio (€1,180 million) and the increase in net premiums earned (€1,160 million).
Non-life net premiums for the year 2019 were up 18%, driven by a 21% increase in the Property and Casualty
(P&C) segment and a 14% increase in the Specialty segment. Net premium in Life & Health segment were up 21%
compared to the same period of 2018.

Net revenues of Ferrari for 2019 were €3,766 million with an increase of €346 million (+10.1%) compared to
€3,420 million in 2018, mainly attributable to the combination of a €391 million increase in cars and spare parts,
partially offset by a €86 million decrease in engines.

Net Profit (loss

In 2019 FCA net profit was €6,630 million, of which €3,930 million from discontinued operations (including the net
gain on the disposal of Magneti Marelli for €3,769 million) and €2,700 million from continuing operations
(€3,330 million in 2018). The decrease in the net profit from continuing operations (€630 million) was mainly driven
by the pre-tax impact of the €1,376 million impairment of assets recognized in relation to the rationalization of
product portfolio plans and the increase in tax charges, partially offset by the one-off of €748 million for estimated
costs related to U.S. diesel emissions matters recognized during 2018. Decreased operating performance in EMEA
and Maserati was offset by improvements in APAC, LATAM and North America.

Net profit of CNH Industrial was €809 million in 2019 compared to €1,251 million in 2018. In 2019, net profit
included a charge of €147 million related to the asset optimization portion of the "Transform2Win" strategy, the
€18 million pre-tax non-cash settlement charge resulting from the purchase of a group annuity contract, the pre-tax
gain of €42 million related to a healthcare plan amendment in the U.S., the €24 million charge related to the
repurchase of notes and €103 million of restructuring costs.

In 2018, net profit included the after-tax gain of €357 million related to the Benefit Modification gain previously
mentioned, the €20 million charge related to the repurchase of notes and $56 million of restructuring costs.

Net profit of PartnerRe was €831 million in 2019 compared to a net loss of €75 million in 2018. The positive change
of €906 million is mainly due to the increase in net revenues (€2,340 million, principally due to a net increase in
realized and unrealized investment gains and in net premiums earned), partially offset by an increase in cost of
sales (€1,109 million), in financial expenses (€185 million), in general expenses (€61 million) and in tax expense
(€54 million).

In 2019 net profit of Ferrari was €699 million (€787 million in 2018). The decrease of €88 million is mainly due to an
increase in cost of sales, general expenses and research and development for a total amount of €254 million, an
increase in tax expense (€160 million), partially offset by an improvement in net revenues, principally in cars and
spare part (€346 million).

of certain assets or merge with or into other companies and use assets as security for other transactions. Further,
certain bond issues and bank borrowings require the issuer to remain in compliance with financial ratio covenants.

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (APM)

To facilitate the understanding of the economic and financial performance of EXOR and of the Group, the
Management of EXOR has identified a number of Alternative Performance Measures (APM), which are used to
identify operational trends and to make investment and resource allocation decisions. To ensure that the APM are
correctly interpreted it is emphasized that these measures are not indicative of the future performance of the
Group. The APM are not part of international reporting standards (IFRS) and are unaudited. They should not be
taken as replacements of the measures required under the reference financial reporting standards.

The APM should be read together with the consolidated financial information prepared using the shortened
consolidation criterion. Since they are not based on the reference financial reporting standards, the APM used by
EXOR may not be consistent and comparable with those used by other companies or groups. The APM used by
EXOR have been consistently calculated and presented for all the reporting periods for which financial information
is presented in this Report.

It should also be noted that the principal subsidiaries and associates make use of non-GAAP financial measures to
illustrate their performance to the market. Such indicators are commonly used by analysts and investors in the
sectors to which the subsidiaries belong to evaluate business performance. A description of how such indicators
are calculated is provided by the individual subsidiary companies and these are included in the section Review of
performance of the Operating Subsidiaries in the Board Report, as extracted from their respective published
documents. Such information is prepared autonomously by the companies and is not homogeneous.

Set out below are the main APM'’s identified by EXOR:

e Net Asset Value
¢ Net Financial Position
e Share of the profit (loss) of investments accounted for using the equity method.

Net Asset Value (NAV)

Definition and Methodology

Net Asset Value (NAV) corresponds to the total value of assets net of the Gross Debt of the Holdings System as
defined below. In determining the total value of assets at 31 December 2019, listed equity investments and other
securities are valued at official market trading prices, unlisted equity investments are valued at fair value,
determined annually by independent experts at the end of the year and unlisted other investments (funds and
similar instruments) are valued by reference to the most recent available fair value. Bonds held to maturity are
valued at amortized cost.

Treasury stock relates to the shares held in treasury before the Share Buyback Program launched on
14 November 2018. Treasury shares are valued at the official stock exchange price, except for the part designated
to service stock option plans (measured at the option exercise price under the plan if this is less than the stock
exchange price).

The sum of the aforesaid values constitutes the total value of assets (Gross Asset Value or GAV). Gross Debt
corresponds to the total amount of the financial debt of the Holdings System.

Items included in the calculation of Gross Asset Value and Gross Debt which are denominated in foreign
currencies are converted at the official exchange rates at the corresponding reporting date.

Highlights

e At 31 December 2019 EXOR’s NAV is $26,155 million (€23,282 million) compared to $19,740 million
(€17,238 million) at 31 December 2018.

¢ At 31 December 2019 EXOR’s NAV per share amounts to $110.77 or €98.60 compared to $82.33 (€71.89
at 31 December 2018), an increase of $28.44/share or +34.5%. This compares to an MSCI World Index
increase of +25.2%.

At 31 December 2019, the NAV per share is calculated taking into account market prices for listed companies and
independent fair valuations for non-listed assets. In the case of PartnerRe, the fair value has been aligned to the
price under the Memorandum of Understanding signed with Covéa on 3 March 2020. NAV per share at
31 December 2019 and at 31 December 2018 are based on 236,121,668 and 239,768,490 shares respectively.

Net financial position of the Holdings System
The net financial position of the Holdings System, determined by applying the shortened consolidation criterion, is a
representative measure of the financial resources and commitments directly attributable to and managed by EXOR.

Using the shortened consolidation criterion adopted by EXOR, rather than the line-by-line method of consolidation
required by law and under IFRS, the data derived from the financial statements or accounting data prepared in
accordance with IFRS by EXOR and by the subsidiaries constituting the Holdings System - Exor Nederland N.V.
(the Netherlands), EXOR S.A. (Luxembourg), Exor Investments Limited (United Kingdom), Exor Investment (UK)
LLP (United Kingdom), Ancom USA Inc. (USA), Exor SN LLC (USA) - are consolidated in the financial statements
of the parent company EXOR using the line-by-line method, while the data derived from the financial statements or
accounting data prepared in accordance with IFRS of the operating subsidiaries and associates (PartnerRe,
Ferrari, CNH Industrial, Juventus Football Club, Exor Seeds, The Economist Group and Welltec) are included in
the consolidated financial statements of the parent company EXOR using the equity method.

The presentation of financial data under the shortened consolidation method facilitates the analysis of the financial
position and results of EXOR and it is generally recognized by the financial community, including financial
counterparties and rating agencies.

Nevertheless, such data do not fully represent, nor should be treated as the consolidated financial position of the
EXOR Group prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In fact, the
shortened consolidation method is not contemplated in the reference accounting standards on the presentation of
consolidated financial statements and may not be consistent with the method adopted by other groups and,
therefore, such data may not be comparable with the data reported by such groups. The consolidated data
prepared in shortened form are not audited by the independent auditors.

REVIEW OF THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
OF THE EXOR GROUP — SHORTENED

This section includes the results of the EXOR Group based on the “shortened” criterion of
consolidation.

According to this method, the Holdings System companies are consolidated line-by-line and the
operating subsidiaries and associates are consolidated using the equity method.

While the presentation of such data is not contemplated in the reference accounting standards,
EXOR believes that this information facilitates the analysis of the results and the financial
position of EXOR.

REVIEW OF THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF THE EXOR GROUP - SHORTENED

As described above in the APM section, EXOR applies a shortened consolidation criterion to facilitate the analysis
of the financial position and results of EXOR.

Using the shortened consolidation criterion, rather than the line-by-line method of consolidation required by law and
under IFRS, the data derived from the financial statements or accounting data prepared in accordance with IFRS
by EXOR and by the subsidiaries constituting the Holdings System are consolidated in the financial statements of
the parent company EXOR using the line-by-line method, while the data derived from the financial statements or
accounting data prepared in accordance with IFRS of the operating subsidiaries (PartnerRe, Ferrari, FCA,
CNH Industrial, Juventus Football Club and Exor Seeds) and associates (The Economist Group and Welltec) are
included in the consolidated financial statements of the parent company EXOR using the equity method.

The consolidated data prepared in shortened form are not audited by the independent auditors.

The following table shows the scope of consolidation under the shortened method:

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - SHORTENED

1.

Profit (loss) from investments in subsidiaries and associates

Share of the profit (loss) of investments accounted for using the equity method

The share of the profit of investments accounted for using the equity method in the year of 2019 amounts to
€3,033 million, with an increase of €1,596 million compared to the year 2018 (€1,437 million). The positive
change reflects in particular the increase in the share of the profit of PartnerRe (€903 million) and FCA
(€852 million), partially offset by the decrease of CNH Industrial (€102 million), The Economist Group
(€25 million), Ferrari (€19 million) and by the increase in the negative result of Juventus (€27 million).

In particular the increase of FCA is principally due to a net gain realized on the disposal of Magneti Marelli of
€3.8 billion (EXOR’s share €1.1 billion), while the increase of PartnerRe is principally driven by the
improvements of net realized and unrealized investment gains.

The positive change in EXOR’s investment in PartnerRe (€758 million) is mainly attributable to EXOR’s shares
of the profit (€798 million), the positive translation exchange differences (€172 million), partially offset by the
payment of dividends (€178 million).

BOARD REPORT


--- Page 23 ---

The positive change in EXOR’s investment in Ferrari (€36 million) is primarily due to EXOR’s shares of the
profit (€167 million), partially offset by the buy-back of treasury stock (€93 million) and the payment of
dividends (€46 million).

The positive change in EXOR’s investment in FCA (€1,019 million) is mainly attributable to EXOR’s shares of
the profit (€1,898 million), the positive translation exchange differences (€73 million), partially offset by the
payment of dividends (€876 million) and the negative cash flow hedge reserve (€39 million).

The positive change in EXOR’s investment in CNH Industrial (€130 million) can be ascribed primarily to
EXOR’s shares of the profit (€212 million) and the positive translation exchange differences (€17 million),
partially offset by the payment of dividends (€67 million) and the negative remeasurement of the defined
benefit plan reserve (€36 million).

Investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income

The investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income amount to €78 million
(€55 million at 31 December 2018) and include principally investments in listed equity instruments. The
positive change (€23 million) is due to new investments (€50 million), partially offset by the negative fair value
adjustment (€6 million) and the reclassification of Exor Seeds to “Investments in subsidiaries and associates”
(€22 million).

PartnerRe

(99.72% of voting rights; 100% interest in common shareholder's equity through EXOR Nederland N.V.)

Data presented and commented below are derived from PartnerRe’s consolidated financial information for the year
ended 31 December 2019 prepared in accordance with US GAAP.

Year

$ million 2019 2018

Net premiums written 6,909 5,803
Non-life combined ratio® 100.3% 101.9%
Life and Health allocated underwriting result” 73 86
Net investment return 7.7% 0.1%
Other expenses 370 306
Net (loss) income attributable to PartnerRe common shareholders” 890 (132)
Net Income ROE” 14.4% (2.2)%

(a) PartnerRe uses a combined ratio to measure results for the Non-life P&C and Specialty segments. The combined ratio is the sum of the technical and other
expense ratios.

(b) PartnerRe uses allocated underwriting result as a measure of underwriting performance for its Life and Health segment. This metric is defined as net premiums
earned, other income or loss and allocated net investment income less life policy benefits, acquisition costs and other expenses.

(c) Net income/loss attributable to PartnerRe common shareholders is defined as net income/loss attributable to PartnerRe less preferred dividends.

(d) Net income ROE is calculated as net income return on average common shareholders’ equity.

Net premiums written for 2019 increased to $6.9 billion compared to $5.8 billion in 2018. Non-life net premiums
written were up 18% for the full year 2019 compared to 2018, driven by a 21% increase in the P&C segment and a
14% increase in the Specialty segment.

The Non-life combined ratio was 100.3% for the full year 2019 compared to 101.9% for 2018. The improvement in
combined ratio was driven by the P&C segment with a combined ratio of 98.7% for the full year 2019 compared to
108.7% for the same period of 2018, reflecting an improvement in the current accident year attritional loss ratio and
a decrease in losses related to large catastrophic events. Catastrophic losses of $258 million, net of retrocession
and reinstatement premiums, related to Typhoons Hagibis and Faxai and Hurricane Dorian contributed 8.4 points
on the P&C combined ratio for the full year 2019, compared to 15.1 points in 2018 related to Typhoons Jebi and
Trami, Hurricanes Florence and Michael, and California wildfires. This was offset by the Specialty segment, which
recorded a combined ratio of 103.0% for the full year 2019 compared to 91.9% for the same period of 2018, driven
by net adverse prior years' reserve development and a large loss on Ethiopian Airlines and Boeing of $42 million,
net of retrocession and reinstatement premiums (2.1 points on the Specialty combined ratio).

The Life and Health allocated underwriting result was a profit of $73 million in 2019 compared to a profit of
$86 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by adverse experience in PartnerRe's short term life
business, higher expenses to support growth in the business and higher annual incentive bonus payment to
employees.

Net investment return for 2019 was $1,352 million, or 7.7%, which included net investment income of $449 million,
net realized and unrealized investment gains of $887 million and interest in earnings of equity method investments
of $16 million. This compares to a net investment return of $37 million, or 0.1%, for the full year 2018, which
included net investment income of $416 million and interest in earnings of equity method investments of
$11 million, offset by net realized and unrealized investment losses of $390 million.

Net realized and unrealized investment gains of $887 million for the full year 2019 included net realized and
unrealized investment gains of $434 million on fixed maturities and short-term investments, primarily due to
decreases in world-wide risk-free rates and credit spreads, and $453 million of net realized and unrealized
investment gains on equities, investments in real estate and other invested assets, primarily due to gains in public
equity funds.

BOARD REPORT

31


--- Page 28 ---

Included within the net realized and unrealized investment gains of $434 million on fixed maturities and short-term
investments was $244 million of net realized gains, primarily due to PartnerRe's decisions to rebalance certain
portfolios, particularly in lower rated investment grade credit, and to reallocate the proceeds to other investment
classes, particularly highly rated governments and mortgage backed securities, and to alternative credit. For the full
year 2018, net realized and unrealized investment losses of $390 million included net realized and unrealized
investment losses of $376 million on fixed maturities and short-term investments, driven by increases in U.S. risk
free rates and the widening of U.S. and European investment grade corporate spreads, and $14 million of net
realized and unrealized investment losses on equities, investments in real estate and other invested assets.

Other Income Statement items

Other income was $15 million for the full year 2019 compared to $50 million for 2018. During the fourth quarter of
2018 PartnerRe recognized a gain on commutation of $29 million due to the reserve and reinsurance agreement
with Colisée Re being commuted with the associated guaranteed reserves and funds held and directly managed
assets released.

Other expenses of $370 million (expense ratio of 5.7%) for the full year 2019 increased by $64 million when
compared to 2018 ($306 million - expense ratio of 5.5%). The increase was primarily driven by (i) higher annual
incentive and long-term incentive payout for employees of $39 million compared to prior year due to the strong
growth in book value reported by PartnerRe in 2019 and (ii) an increase in Life and Health expenses compared to
prior year to support the organic growth of the business.

Net foreign exchange losses were $87 million for the full year 2019, driven by the depreciation of the U.S. dollar
against certain major currencies and the cost of hedging compared to gains of $119 million for 2018, driven by the
appreciation of the U.S. dollar against certain major currencies, partially offset by hedging costs.

Interest expense of $40 million for the full year 2019 compared to $43 million for 2018. During the second quarter
of 2019, PartnerRe issued $500 million 3.70% Senior Notes due 2029 and used the proceeds to early redeem the
$500 million 5.50% Senior Notes due 2020 in the third quarter of 2019. These transactions resulted in the lower
interest expense in 2019. Loss on redemption of debt was $15 million for the full year 2019, related to the
redemption of PartnerRe's 5.50% Senior Notes due 2020 at a make-whole redemption price.

Preferred dividends of $46 million paid in 2019 were comparable to 2018.

Income tax expense was $53 million on pre-tax income of $989 million in 2019 compared to an income tax benefit
of $9 million on pre-tax losses of $95 million in 2018. These amounts were primarily driven by the geographical
distribution of pre-tax profits and losses.

Balance sheet and capitalization

Total investments and cash and cash equivalents were $17.8 billion at 31 December 2019, up 9.4% compared to
31 December 2018. The increase to 31 December 2019 was primarily driven by the $1,352 million net investment
return for the full year 2019 and the increase in payables for securities purchased to $169 million as at
31 December 2019 from $80 million as at 31 December 2018.

Cash and cash equivalents, fixed maturities and short-term investments, which are government issued or
investment grade fixed income securities, were $12.8 billion at 31 December 2019, representing 72% of the total
investments and cash and cash equivalents.

The average credit rating of the fixed income portfolio increased to AA as of 31 December 2019 compared to A at
31 December 2018. The improvement in the average credit quality of the fixed income portfolio was due to actions
taken during 2019 to reduce exposure to lower rated investment grade credit and reinvest certain proceeds in
highly rated governments and mortgage backed securities. The expected average duration of the public fixed
income portfolio at 31 December 2019 was 2.7 years, while the average duration of PartnerRe’s liabilities was 4.3
years.

There were no dividends declared and paid to common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2019 and fourth
quarter of 2018. Dividends declared and paid to common shareholders were $200 million for the full year 2019,
compared to $48 million for the full year 2018.

BOARD REPORT


--- Page 29 ---

Total capital was $8.7 billion at 31 December 2019, up 9.2% compared to 31 December 2018, primarily due to net
income for the full year 2019, partially offset by dividends on preferred and common shares. PartnerRe issued
$500 million 3.70% Senior Notes due 2029 during the second quarter of 2019 and used the proceeds to early
redeem the $500 million 5.50% Senior Notes due 2020 in the third quarter of 2019.

Common shareholder's equity (or book value) of $6.6 billion and tangible book value of $6.0 billion at
31 December 2019 increased by 13.0% and 14.6% respectively, compared to 31 December 2018, primarily due to
net income available to common shareholders for the full year 2019, partially offset by dividends on common
shares. Book value, excluding dividends on common shares for 2019, was up 16.4% compared to 31 December
2018.

Dividends Paid to EXOR
During 2019, PartnerRe declared and paid to Exor Nederland N.V. common share dividends of $200 million
compared to $48 million for the full year 2018.

Reconciliation of reported US GAAP financial information to IFRS financial information used for line-by-line
consolidation purposes

The differences between the US GAAP net income ($890 million) and the IFRS net income ($894 million) are
immaterial and related only to the economic effects of the application of the acquisition method by EXOR to
account for the acquisition.

2020 Outlook

PartnerRe believes that overall, reinsurance will broadly remain a cyclical market, albeit of less amplitude, primarily
as a result of excess capital, and that the cycles will become more specific and local, with less global amplitude.
The outlooks for 2020 for each of PartnerRe's segments are summarized as follows:

2020 P&C Segment Outlook

During the 1 January 2020 renewals, PartnerRe focused on portfolio optimization and improving profit margins and
observed improving pricing trends in most of the North American business. The European business continued to
see flat to low single digit rate decreases in all lines except casualty where pricing increases were observed.

As a result of the persisting competition and excess capacity in the industry, it is not possible to forecast if
improving pricing conditions will continue in the future.

2020 Specialty Segment Outlook

During the 1 January 2020 renewals, PartnerRe focused on portfolio optimization and improving profit margins and
generally observed improved pricing in most lines of business within the Specialty segment (engineering, aviation,
energy, marine, and property).

As a result of the persisting competition and excess capacity in the industry, it is not possible to forecast if
improving pricing conditions will continue in the future.

2020 Life and Health Outlook

The 1 January 2020 renewal for Life business is not considered significant, as only a limited portion of the premium
associated with the Life portfolio is short-term business.

Management expects moderate continued growth in PartnerRe’s Life portfolio in 2020 assuming constant foreign
exchange rates, mainly due to growth in Asia, Canada, Europe and the United States. Pricing conditions are not
expected to materially differ from 2019.

(1) Defined as net debt less net debt of financial services activities.

Shipments

Shipments totaled 10,131 units in 2019 with an increase of 880 units (or 9.5%) compared to the prior year. This
achievement was driven by an 11.2% increase in sales of the 8-cylinder models (V8) and a 4.6% increase of 12-
cylinder models (V12). Robust deliveries of the Ferrari Portofino and the 812 Superfast, along with the first
deliveries of the F8 Tributo, the Ferrari Monza SP1 and SP2, were partially offset by lower volumes from the 488
family, with the 488 GTB and the 488 Spider concluding their lifecycle, partially compensated by the 488 Pista and
the 488 Pista Spider.

(1) Excluding the XX Programme, racing cars, Fuori Serie, one-off and pre-owned cars.

Net revenues

Net revenues for 2019 were €3,766 million, with an increase of €346 million, or 10.1% (an increase of 8.2% ona
constant currency basis). The increase was attributable to the combination of a €391 million increase in cars and
spare parts, €32 million increase in sponsorship, commercial and brand, and €9 million increase in other net
revenues, partially offset by a €86 million decrease in engines.

The increase of €391 million in cars and spare parts revenues was primarily attributable to positive volume impact,
positive contribution from the personalization programs and positive foreign currency impact. In particular, total
shipments increased by 880 cars, or 9.5%, compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to an 11.2% increase
in V8 models and a 4.6% increase in V12 models. The increase in shipments was mainly driven by deliveries of the
Ferrari Portofino, the 812 Superfast, the 488 Pista and 488 Pista Spider, and the initial deliveries of the F8 Tributo,
as well as the initial deliveries of the Ferrari Monza SP1 and SP2 in the last four months of 2019. These effects
were partially offset by lower shipments of the 488 GTB and 488 Spider, which concluded their lifecycle in 2019, as
well as deliveries in 2018 of the LaFerrari Aperta and the strictly limited edition Ferrari J50.

Engines revenues were €198 million for 2019, a decrease of €86 million, or 30.3%, from €284 million for 2018
mainly attributable to a decrease in net revenues generated from the sale of engines to Maserati.

Net revenues generated from sponsorship, commercial agreements and brand management activities were
€538 million for 2019, an increase of €32 million, or 6.4%, from €506 million for 2018. The increase was primarily
attributable to higher revenues from Formula 1 racing activities and positive foreign currency exchange impact.

EBIT

EBIT for 2019 was €917 million, an increase of €91 million, or 11.0%, from €826 million for 2018. As a percentage
of net revenues, EBIT increased from 24.2 percent in 2018 to 24.4 percent in 2019.

The increase in EBIT was primarily attributable to the combined effects of positive volume impact of €99 million,
positive product mix and price impact of €78 million, an increase in research and development costs of €56 million,
an increase in selling, general and administrative costs of €16 million, an increase of industrial costs of €31 million
mainly due to the operational startup costs in connection with the introduction of new models, including higher
depreciation of fixed assets and other variable costs, negative contribution of €33 million due to lower engine sales
to Maserati and other supporting activities, and positive foreign currency exchange impact of €50 million (including
foreign currency hedging instruments) primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the
Euro.

The positive volume impact was attributable to an increase in total shipments, driven by the 488 Pista family, the
Ferrari Portofino and the 812 Superfast, as well as the initial deliveries of the new F8 Tributo, partially offset by
lower shipments of the 488 GTB and the 488 Spider, which concluded their lifecycle in 2019. The positive product
mix and price impact was primarily attributable to the combined positive effects of the Ferrari Monza SP1 and SP2
in the fourth quarter of 2019, the personalization program and deliveries of the FXX K EVO, partially offset by
negative product mix from range models as well as prior year shipments of the LaFerrari Aperta and the strictly
limited edition Ferrari J50.

Net industrial debt

Net industrial debt at 31 December 2019 was €337 million, with a decrease of €33 million compared to €370 million
at 31 December 2018. During 2019, a total worth of €387 million of share repurchases and a €195 million dividend
distribution were accomplished. Lease liabilities per IFRS 16 as of 31 December 2019 were €60 million.

The increase in APAC Net revenues in 2019 of 4% compared to 2018 was primarily due to favorable model mix
and vehicle mix, positive net pricing due to reduced incentives, partially offset by lower volumes. The increase in
APAC Adjusted EBIT was primarily due to increased Net revenues, as well as lower industrial costs, partially offset
by lower China JV results.

EMEA

The decrease in EMEA Net revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 of 10% was primarily due to lower volumes. The
decrease in EMEA Adjusted EBIT was primarily due to lower volumes, higher incentives, compliance and product
costs, partially offset by reduced advertising costs and labor efficiencies resulting from restructuring actions, as well
as favorable model and channel mix.

Maserati

The decrease in Maserati Net revenues in 2019 of 40% compared to 2018 was primarily due to lower volumes. The
decrease in Maserati Adjusted EBIT was primarily due to lower revenues and adjustments of residual values in the
U.S. during the second quarter and higher incentives related to accelerated transition to China 6, partially offset by

favorable model and market mix.

INDUSTRIAL
(26.89% stake, 41.68% of voting rights on issued capital)

Key consolidated figures of CNH Industrial for the year 2019 are as follows:

Year
$ million 2019 2018 Change
Revenues 28,024 29,736 (1,712)
Adjusted EBIT” 1,873 2,028 (155)

of which attributable to owners of the parent 809 1,368 (559)
Net Industrial Debt® (1,403) (639) (764)

(1) Adjusted EBIT is a non-GAAP financial measure used to measure performance. Adjusted EBIT is defined as profit/(loss) before taxes, financial income
(expense) of industrial activities, restructuring costs, and certain non- recurring items.
(2) Net Industrial debt is defined as net debt excluding the funded portion of the sell-liquidating financial receivables portfolio.

Revenues

Revenues for 2019 were $28,024 million, a decrease of 5.8% (down 0.9% on a constant currency basis) compared
to 2018, primarily due to a decrease of 6.3% (down 1.4% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year
in net revenues of Industrial Activities.

Net revenues for Agriculture were $10,958 million in 2019, a 7.0% decrease (down 2.8% on a constant currency
basis) compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lower industry volumes in North America and rest
of world markets, coupled with actions to reduce dealer inventories in the second half of the year, partially offset by
positive price realization performance across all geographies and sustained aftermarket activity.

For 2019, worldwide industry unit sales for tractors decreased 7% compared to 2018, while worldwide industry
sales for combines were down 4% compared to 2018. In North America, industry volumes in the over 140 hp
tractor market sector were down 3% and combines were down 7%. Industry volumes for under 140 hp tractors
were up 2%. European markets were up 5% for tractors and down 16% for combines. In South America, tractor
industry volumes decreased 13% and combine industry volumes decreased 5%. Rest of world markets decreased
10% for tractors and increased 2% for combines.

Net revenues for Construction were $2,768 million in 2019, down 8.4% compared to 2018 (down 6.3% on a
constant currency basis), as result of lower net sales in North America and rest of world markets due to weaker
market conditions and actions to reduce dealer inventory levels in the second half of the year, partially offset by
positive price realization.

In 2019, construction equipment’s worldwide compact equipment industry sales were up 4% compared to 2018,
while worldwide general equipment industry sales were down 1% compared to 2018 and worldwide road building
and site equipment industry sales were down 9%.

Commercial and Specialty Vehicles’ net revenues were $10,440 million in 2019, down 4.5% compared to 2018 (up
1.8% on a constant currency basis), driven by increased deliveries in bus and specialty vehicles, sustained
aftermarket activity and positive price realization, more than offset by reduced wholesale volumes in M&H trucks in
both Europe, where CNH Industrial is transitioning to a new commercial policy and refreshed product offering, and
South America, primarily due to low industry volume in Argentina.

Powertrain net revenues were $4,114 million in 2019, down 9.7% compared to 2018 (down 3.5% on a constant
currency basis), due to lower sales volume. Sales to external customers accounted for 51% of total net revenues
(50% in 2018).

Financial Services reported net revenues of $1,996 million in 2019, flat compared to 2018 (up 3.7% on a constant
currency basis) and primarily due to higher average portfolio, offset by the negative impact from foreign currency
translation.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities was down 8.0% to $1,376 million in 2019, compared to $1,496 million in 2018,
representing an Adjusted EBIT margin of 5.3%, down 10 basis points (“bps”) compared to 2018, mainly due to
unfavorable volume and mix as well as raw material headwinds, which more than offset positive price realization
and cost management actions.

Adjusted EBIT of Agriculture was $900 million in 2019, a $198 million decrease compared to $1,098 million in
2018. Positive price realization, disciplined cost management, industrial efficiencies and a reduction in short-term
incentive compensation expense were more than offset by lower wholesale volume and market and product mix,
including negative industrial absorption primarily from the lower production levels (mainly in the second half of the
year), as well as higher product costs as a result of increased raw material costs and tariffs. Adjusted EBIT margin
decreased 80 bps to 8.2%.

Adjusted EBIT of Construction was $50 million in 2019, a $19 million decrease compared to 2018, with an Adjusted
EBIT margin of 1.8% (2.3% in 2018). Positive price realization was more than offset by unfavorable volume and
mix in North America and rest of world markets, including negative industrial absorption, and higher product costs
primarily related to increased raw material costs and tariffs, and costs associated with the product quality
excellence initiative.

Adjusted EBIT of Commercial and Specialty Vehicles was $188 million in 2019 ($285 million in 2018) and includes
a $50 million gain realized in the third quarter from granting to Nikola Corporation access to certain Iveco
technology as part of the $150 million in-kind contribution as consideration for the initial equity interest in Nikola.
Adjusted EBIT was negatively impacted by higher product costs, foreign exchange transaction impacts, and the
remeasurement of certain provisions completed in the fourth quarter, partially offset by favorable volume and mix,
positive price realization and a reduction in short-term incentive compensation expense.

Adjusted EBIT of Powertrain was $362 million in 2019, a $23 million decrease compared to $385 million in 2018
due to unfavorable volume and mix and higher product development investment geared towards the
“Transform2Win” strategy initiatives, partially offset by positive price realization and product cost efficiencies.
Adjusted EBIT margin was 8.8% in 2019, up 40 bps compared to 2018.

recasting prior periods. Adoption of the standard had an immaterial impact on adjusted EBIT in the year ended at 31 December 2019.

2020 Outlook (US GAAP)”

While CNH Industrial continues to act prudently as a result of prevailing market uncertainties, CNH industrial steps
up its efforts on performance and cost initiatives to drive profitability, while continuing its strategic investments in
digitalization, automation and alternative propulsion.

In light of the aforementioned industry headwinds and the Company’s initiatives planned for 2020, CNH Industrial is
issuing the following 2020 guidance:

— Net sales of Industrial Activities flat to slightly down to prior year in constant currency.
— Adjusted diluted EPS expected between $0.78 to $0.86 per share.
— Free cash flow of Industrial Activities expected between $400 million and $600 million.

Finally, CNH Industrial is fully on track with the separation of it On-Highway and Off-Highway businesses with the
target to complete the spin-off in January 2021, supported by specialist financial and business advisors.

(1) 2020 guidance does not include any impacts deriving from the gain resulting from the modification of the healthcare plan in the U.S. previously mentioned, as
this gain has been considered non-recurring and therefore treated as an adjusting item for the purpose of the adjusted diluted EPS calculation. In addition,
2020 guidance does not include any impacts deriving from possible further repurchases of CNH Industrial’s shares under the plan authorized by the
shareholders on 12 April 2019.

(2) Outlook is not provided on diluted EPS, the most comparable GAAP financial measure of this non-GAAP financial measure, as the income or expense
excluded from the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS and instead included in the calculation of diluted EPS are, by definition, not predictable and uncertain

JUDENTUS

(63.77% of share capital)

The results for the first half of 2019/2020 of Juventus Football Club S.p.A. are as follows:

| Half
€ million 2019/2020 2018/2019 Change
Revenues 322 330 (8)
Operating costs (261) (227) (34)
Operating income (loss) (38) 17 (55)
(Loss)/profit for the period (50) 7 (57)
€ million 31/12/2019 30/06/2019 Change
Shareholders’ equity 276 31 245
Net financial debt 327 464 (137)

For a correct interpretation of the data, it should be noted that the financial year of Juventus does not coincide with the calendar year but covers the period 1 July—
30 June, which corresponds to the football season. The accounting data under examination thus represents the first half of operations for the financial year
2019/2020.

Interim data are prepared only for EXOR consolidated reporting purpose and cannot be construed as representing the basis for a Juventus full-year projection.

Profit performance is characterized by the highly seasonal nature typical of the sector, determined mainly by the calendar of football events and the two phases of
the players’ Transfer Campaign.

The financial position and cash flows are also affected by the seasonal nature of the income components; in addition, some revenue items are collected in a period
different from the period to which they refer.

The loss for the period, strongly affected by the league calendar (2 home Serie A matches less than in the first half
of 2018/2019), mainly derived from lower revenues for €8 million, higher players’ wages and technical staff costs
for €30 million, higher players’ registration rights expenses for €10 million, higher amortization and write-downs on
players’ registration rights for €11 million, higher other amortization for €3 million and higher net financial expenses
for €3 million. These changes were partially offset by lower purchases for products held for sale for €4 million,
lower costs for external services for €3 million and reduced provisions for €1 million.

Shareholders’ equity at 31 December 2019 amounted to €276 million, with an increase of €245 million compared to
the closing at 30 June 2019 (€31 million), due to accounting recognition of the portion of the share capital increase
(€295 million) net of related costs, and to the loss for period (€50 million).

2020 Outlook
The 2019/2020 financial year of Juventus Football Club, forecasted to result in a loss, will be as usual strongly
influenced by sports results, in particular in the UEFA Champions League.

antitrust, regulatory and other approvals.

Appointment of Suzanne Heywood as Acting Chief Executive Officer of CNH Industrial

On 22 March 2020 Suzanne Heywood, Managing Director of EXOR, was appointed by the board of directors of
CNH Industrial as Acting Chief Executive Officer, following the resignation of Hubertus Muhlhauser as CEO, who
left the Group. Lady Heywood, in addition to her role as Chair of the board of directors, will lead the business until a
new permanent CEO has been identified by means of a thorough search process.

Covid-19

The recent outbreak of Covid-19 (Coronavirus), a virus causing potentially deadly respiratory tract infections
originating in China and spreading worldwide, will negatively affect economic conditions regionally as well globally,
disrupt operations situated in countries particularly exposed to the contagion, affect supply chains or otherwise
impact EXOR’s businesses.

Governments in affected countries are imposing travel bans, quarantines, restrictions on travel and the movement
and gathering of people, as well as restrictions on commercial activity and other emergency public safety
measures.

In order to respond to the interruption of market demand by ensuring optimisation of supply, FCA, CNH Industrial
and Ferrari have temporarily suspended production across the majority of their manufacturing plants.

These measures, though temporary in nature, may continue and increase depending on developments with regard
to the virus’ outbreak. The ultimate severity of the Coronavirus outbreak is uncertain at this time and therefore
EXOR cannot reasonably estimate the impact it will have on its operations and results.
