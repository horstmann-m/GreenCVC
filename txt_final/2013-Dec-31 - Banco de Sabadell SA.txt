Dear shareholder,

At the end of 2013, our 132nd year of trading, Banco Sabadell could show a set of re-
sults that reflected a recovery in margins and a return to profitable growth, a strength-
ened balance sheet supported by one of the best capital ratios in the Spanish financial
industry, and proven financial solidity. 2013 was also the last year of our ‘CREA Plan,
launched in 2011 with business transformation and productivity as its main themes.
Strong growth in business volumes and customer numbers were key

developments during a complex 3-year period which saw substantial growth in
market shares in line with the group’s increase in scale, in a challenging economic and
financial environment.

The gradual return of the financial markets to normality and the easing of capital
market fragmentation in the eurozone from mid-2012 onwards continued all through
2013, punctuated by limited, short-term bouts of market instability such as those
caused by the Cyprus bail-out or political tensions in Italy and Portugal. The eurozone
began to free itself from the sovereign debt crisis as the headwinds facing the region
abated and became less systemic. Ireland and Spain recently announced the cessation
of their international assistance programmes, while agreements on a European bank-
ing union provided further support for market normalization.

This improvement in the financial markets was reflected in better funding
conditions for the countries on the European periphery as country risk premiums
dropped and inflows of foreign capital to the periphery recovered; it was also good
for economic stability.

The global economy grew at a moderate rate in 2013, with growth in the devel-
oped countries gathering pace as the year progressed. The eurozone economy showed
signs of reaching a turning point in the second half of the year: Spain, in particular,
achieved positive growth in the third quarter for the first time in more than two years,
while its labour market appeared to be stabilizing. Activity was also supported by the
country’s strong export performance as financing conditions became more benign
and the European Commission allowed some relaxation of fiscal discipline. Moreover,
structural reforms and rapid progress in correcting the imbalances that had built
up during the previous boom helped to bring about an improvement in how Spain
was seen in other countries and prepared the ground for faster, more balanced
economic growth.

The restructuring of the banking system in Spain resulted in a consolidation of
the industry and made banks more solvent. Banco Sabadell extended its geographical
reach and increased its share of the Spanish market, having during the past year com-
pleted the acquisition of Banco Mare Nostrum’s branches and business in Catalonia
and Aragon, and the business of Banco Gallego and Lloyds Espajia; these acquisitions
have strengthened our position in some of Spain’s most promising regions. Banco
Sabadell ended the year with total assets of €163,441.5 million and a core capital ratio
of 12%. In 2013 Banco Sabadell increased its capital base by more than €1,500
million. In September it carried out a €1,383 million capital-raising in two separate
share offerings. The first of these, a €650 million accelerated bookbuild offering,
was aimed at institutional investors. The second was a €733 million rights issue for
existing shareholders.

In October 2013 a capital management exercise was carried out in which the holders
of Banco Gallego preferred and subordinated debt securities were invited to exchange
their securities for subordinated notes mandatorily convertible to Banco Sabadell
shares. The exercise resulted in a further capital increase of €122 million.

These transactions enabled Banco Sabadell to strengthen its capital position and
to place itself alongside Europe's best-capitalized banks, meet the stricter capital re-
quirements being imposed on the banking industry and bring its capital structure into
line with the increased size of its consolidated balance sheet following the acquisitions
of the last few years.

The Bank's funding policy was focused on attracting deposits and other customer
accounts and thus reducing its reliance on the wholesale market; this ensured that in
2013 it was once again able to generate a substantial funding gap — €10,123 million —
and significantly increase its liquidity position.

Actively managed interest spreads and the contributions of the newly-acquired
businesses brought our net interest income to a year-end total of €1,814.7 million.
This was a 2.9% fall compared with 2012 — a result, mainly, of the negative effects of a
falling yield curve in the first half of the year. An improved performance in the second
half, however, confirmed the shift to an upward trend.

Higher net profits from the fixed-income portfolio, coupled with a firm grip on
costs that reduced like-for-like personnel and general expenses by 13.2% and 11.4%
respectively, helped our profit before provisions to rise by 59.9% on the figure for 2012
to reach a total of €2,062.3 million.

Banco Sabadell posted a net profit for 2013 of €247.8 million, three times the
figure for 2012. This confirms our ability to maintain solid progress and to generate
consistently positive results after impairment charges and other provisions amounting
to €1,763.6 million. Provision coverage of credit and real estate exposures, at 13.6%,
was above the average for the industry as a whole.

A high rate of new customer acquisition with customer enrolments averaging
8,900 a week, rising market shares, and good progress in restoring health to the new
businesses added to the group; these were the dominant themes of an extremely busy
year which saw customers increasing to a total of 6.5 million while top-quality service
being maintained at all times.

Gross loans and advances to customers (excluding repos) increased strongly in
2013, rising by more than 4.2% on the previous year to a total of €124,614.9 million.
Specific provision coverage for assets classified as doubtful due to loan arrears was
50.1%, and here too there were signs of a change: non-performing loans dropped by
€64 million in the fourth quarter and there was a slowing in the pace of balance sheet
asset writedowns.

The year 2013 saw the successful completion of the integration of Banco Mare
Nostrum’s Catalonia and Aragon branch network and business, making Banco
Sabadell the fourth largest bank in Catalonia with 12% of bank branches in the region.
The merger and systems integration of the business acquired from Lloyds Espafia
and Banco Gallego are due to be completed in the first quarter of 2014. The integra-
tion of Lloyds will strengthen Banco Sabadell’s franchise among Spain’s non-resident
community, while the addition of Banco Gallego will bring the group’s share of bank
branches in the Galicia region up to 7%. In the US, Banco Sabadell continued to grow

its capacity to serve customers in the State of Florida and Latin America, having com-
pleted the acquisition and integration of Lloyds’ private banking business in Miami
and, in December, entered into an agreement to acquire JGB Bank. The JGB agree-
ment is expected to complete in the course of 2014.

This Annual Report contains detailed information on how our business per-
formed in 2013 and the acquisitions we made in the course of the year. The data it pro-
vides clearly show how our margins have improved in the current economic climate
and the group’s success in getting profits back onto a rising path after the huge efforts
it has made to rebuild its financial strength. The report testifies to a fortified, well-
structured balance sheet, a strong capital underpinning and a high level of provision-
ing against balance sheet exposures.

Our achievements in 2013 are manifold, so the group has marked out a new posi-
tion for itself on the Spanish financial services map, despite the complex environment
in which it has been operating as a result of the economic situation in our country.
That this has been possible is thanks to the professionalism and hard work of all the
people who make up the Banco Sabadell group and the expertise they have shown in
weathering the crisis of the last few years.

Banco Sabadell enters 2014 with a new business plan focused on improving profit-
ability. The plan’s basic aims are to consolidate our domestic business by extracting
value from our customer base and leveraging our newly-acquired scale to gain margin,
restructure our balance sheet, and transform our production system to win further
increases in productivity, but without any loss in quality of service, key to maintaining
our competitive edge. Our challenge nowis to continue the task of making our
business more efficient, more profitable and more evenly distributed throughout
Spain, while preparing the ground for the next stage of our international expansion.

Macroeconomic environment
Key events in 2013

In 2013 the Spanish economy reached
a turning point and the first signs were seen
of stabilization in the labour market.

The financial industry continued to make
progress in restructuring and Spain confirmed
that it would exit from the international
assistance programme in January 2014.

The return of the financial markets to normality and the gradual easing of
capital market fragmentation in the eurozone continued throughout 2013
despite certain occurrences (e.g. the Cyprus bail-out and political tensions in
Italy and Portugal) that triggered bouts of market instability (see Figure 1).

Spain confirmed that the European aid programme for its financial sector
would end in January 2014 and Ireland became the first bail-out country to exit
from a comprehensive aid package, without additional support.

Despite these developments, bank credit markets remained weak and
fragmented, with different countries showing wide variations in interest rates
on loans to small and medium-sized businesses (see Figure 2).

Europe took a step further towards integration with new advances being
made in the establishment of a European banking union. In particular, the
European Central Bank (ECB) was given the role of acting as single banking
supervisor for the eurozone from late 2014 onwards.

The global economy showed modest growth in 2013, with the economies
of the developed world gathering pace as the year progressed (see Figure 3).
In the second half of the year the eurozone reached a turning point which
was felt both in the core countries and on the periphery. In the third quarter
the Spanish economy achieved positive growth, for the first time in more than
two years.

In emerging markets, growth was below the average for the past decade as cur-
rent growth models became obsolete and major structural challenges emerged.
China's new government introduced a reform plan to change the growth model
and to make it more sustainable in the long term.

Inflation fell in all the main developed economies with the exception of Ja-
pan. This was especially true in the eurozone, with inflation in some peripheral
countries close to zero or even negative by the end of the year (see Figure 4).

The monetary policy pursued by the main central banks in 2013 contin-
ued to be accommodative, although some divergences appeared. In the US,
for example, the Federal Reserve moved towards a change in the direction of
its monetary policy by announcing that it would shortly be reducing its asset
purchases. The European Central Bank reduced its benchmark interest rate to
an unprecedented 0.25% and committed itself to keeping benchmark rates low
for along period of time (see Figure 5).

In the long-term debt markets, US and German bond yields ended 2013
higher than they had been at the beginning of the year. On the European
periphery, Spanish and Italian public debt improved gradually throughout the
year. In the currency markets the euro strengthened against the dollar, while
the yen weakened against all the major international currencies. Equity
markets again ended the year with gains in the US, the eurozone and Japan
(see Figure 6).

Share performance

Banco Sabadell completed a successful
capital-raising, increasing its share capital by
€1,383 million in two separate share offerings.
This enabled it to strengthen its capital base
and allowed the position as one of Europe’s
most solidly capitalized banks.

In 2013 Banco Sabadell’s share price was dragged down by the weak economic
environment and fears over the state of Spain’s financial system, especially in
the first half of the year. Despite the challenging conditions facing the sector,
however, the Bank’s capital-raising exercise in September was very well re-
ceived by the market. In the latter part of the year the continuing improvement
in sentiment with regard to Spain, Banco Sabadell’s successful capital-raising
and the announcement of new rules on deferred tax assets provided support to
ashare performance that was above that of its domestic market peers.

Financial report
In 2013 Banco Sabadell completed the last year of its 3-year “CREA” plan,
launched in 2011 with the aim of bringing about a transformation in business
and productivity. Large increases in business volumes and customer numbers
were major achievements in a very complex and busy 3-year period during
which the group was able to substantially increase market shares as a result
of expansion through acquisitions and intensive efforts to boost its sales and
marketing capabilities.

During the economic downturn that lasted from 2007 to 2013, we made
a huge leap forward that is key to understanding what we achieved in 2013
and our prospects in coming years.

In the last five years Banco Sabadell
has achieved a huge leap in scale and scored
some milestone successes.

In a highly complex and challenging
operating environment, strong business growth
and a major effort to win new customers have
produced sizeable increases in our market shares.

All this without any loss in perceived
quality of service levels to customers.

Triple

Banco Sabadell has now launched its new three-year business plan, known as
“Plan Triple”. The overall aim of the plan is for the Bank to leverage its im-
proved capital position and market share to lead a recovery in lending in the
short, medium and long term.

The focus of the new business plan is on increasing profitability as reflected
ina target ROTE (return on equity less goodwill) of 12% for 2016. Within this
general aim, the plan’s main action areas are a strengthened domestic business,
atransformation of the balance sheet and a revamped production system.

Having taken a huge leap in scale, Banco Sabadell’s focus is now on con-
solidating its domestic business and increasing the profitability of its newly
acquired businesses. To do this it has set out two strategies for different regions
according to its market position in each one. In the Catalonia and Southeast
(Valencia and Murcia) regions the Bank has now reached a suitable scale and
its business focus will therefore be on profitability, cross-selling and closing the
performance gap in the newly acquired businesses.

In the rest of the country the focus is on “filling our branches with custom-
ers” and increasing market share. Banco Sabadell also intends to continue
improving customer relationships so as to become the customer's banker of
choice and to grow its market shares in mutual funds and insurance.

The second key action area for Banco Sabadell has to do with balance sheet
transformation: bringing down loan losses and selling off real estate assets.

To reduce real estate losses the Bank has put in hand management programmes
combining timely action (to reduce new loan defaults) with recovery (faster
debt recoveries). To reduce its holdings of real estate assets the Bank will
continue to leverage the expertise of its asset management division and the
leadership of its property sales business, Solvia, while benefiting from an
improving real estate market.

The third key action area under the Triple plan is to transform its produc-
tion system so as to increase productivity, but without any loss in the quality
of service for which the Bank has always been renowned. For example, a new
instant banking system has been created which will initially be rolled out in key
growth areas such as the Madrid region. Alongside these three action areas
the new business plan sets additional objectives focused on preparing the
ground for future expansion into foreign markets and on talent and human
resources management.

The principal targets of the Triple plan, with it’s focused on increasing
profitability, reducing troubled assets and driving up efficiency, are as follows:

Capital management

Core capital ratio rises to 12.0%
following €1,505 million in capital
increases over the year.

In 2013 Banco Sabadell continued to pursue the active capital management
policy that it has been following for the last few years, with major implications
for future growth. In the last three years the Bank has increased its capital by
issuing securities that qualify as core capital. As a result its capital base has
risen by more than €5,000 million and capital ratios have reached highly satis-
factory levels, as 2013 year-end data confirm. Key actions taken in the course of
2013 to increase the Bank’s solvency included the following:

— Exchanging mandatory convertible subordinated bonds, issues I/2009 and
1/2010, for new convertible bond issues I/2013 and II/2013 with a value of
€779.3 million (January 2013).

— A€1,383 million increase in equity capital approved by the Board of
Directors on 9 September. The increase was carried out in two separate
share offerings.

The first offering, directed at institutional investors, amounted to €650 12.0%
million and was carried out by the accelerated bookbuild procedure. A total CORE CAPITAL
of 396.3 million new shares were allotted for a price of €1.64 per share. The
second offering, totalling €732.7 million, was a rights issue addressed to EASE IIRUUNORDED
the Bank’s existing shareholders. In the second offering 666 million newly CORE TIER 1 RATIO
issued shares were offered at a nominal value of €0.125 each plus an issue
premium of €0.975 on each new share, that is, a total issue price of €1.10
per share. Five preferential subscription rights were required in order to
subscribe for a single new share.

The capital increase had the dual purpose of strengthening Banco
Sabadell’s balance sheet to enable it to benefit from business opportunities
in the context of a Spanish economy that was starting to recover, and boost-
ing its capital strength to meet stricter regulatory capital requirements on
the banking industry and bring its capital structure into line with a
consolidated balance sheet that had grown as a result of the acquisitions
made in the previous few years.

— Anexchange of Banco Gallego preferred securities and subordinated debt
for subordinated notes mandatorily convertible to Banco Sabadell shares,
in October 2013. The exchange offer was accepted in respect of 93.7% of
the securities and generated a capital inflow of €121.7 million.

Balance sheet management

A healthy €10,123 million funding gap
and substantial increases in customer funds,
with mutual funds and demand
deposits growing at an accelerating pace.

Following the takeover of assets
from BMN-Penedés, Lloyds Espafia and
Banco Gallego, Banco Sabadell’s
customer base now stands at 6.5 million.

Year-on-year comparisons of balance sheet figures were affected by the incor-
poration of accounts and balances relating to the Catalonia and Aragon branch
banking business acquired from Banco Mare Nostrum (“BMN-Penedés”

from 1 June 2013 onwards; Lloyds Bank International and Lloyds Investment
Espafia (“SabadellSolbank”) from 30 June onwards; and Banco Gallego, from
31 October onwards. At the end of 2013, the total assets of Banco Sabadell and
its group amounted to €163,4-41.5 million, having increased by €1,894.4 million
from where they stood at the end of 2012, an increase of 1.2% that was attribut-
able in large measure to new business resulting from the above acquisitions.
Of particular significance among the items on the consolidated balance sheet
were gross loans and advances to customers (excluding assets acquired under
repurchase agreements), which increased to a total of €124,614.9 million at the
end of 2013, arise of 4.2%.

Mortgage loans, the single largest component of gross lending, amounted
to approximately 57% of total loans and advances at 31 December 2013 (see
Figure 11).

Reclassifications of loan refinancings and the additions to the consolidated
group were factors that caused the ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) to
total qualifying loans and advances to rise to 13.63% (11.13% with reclassifica-
tions excluded); this did not include former Banco CAM assets benefiting from
the asset protection scheme. At the last quarter of 2013 a €64 million fall in
NPLs and the fourth consecutive quarterly slowdown in additions to the inven-
tory of troubled assets suggested that a turning point had been reached. 2013
sales of real estate assets were better than expected, increasing by 40% over the
previous year to €3,120 million and exceeding forecasts by 20%. In all, 18,501
residential properties were sold during the year, 16% more than projected.

Loan loss provisions were further
increased to cover credit exposures in the
loan portfolio and there were signs
of a turning point in NPLs.

On-balance sheet customer funds showed a sizeable 17.9% increase; an

especially strong performance by demand deposits was driven by an upturn in

payment transactions by customers and by a growing tendency to choose the

Bank as principal banker, leading to a deepening of customer relationships.
The growth in customer numbers and business volumes shown in the table

below was reflected in significant increases in market shares, including

a 23.98% share in export finance.

Liquidity management
and funding

The group’s funding policy continued
to focus on attracting deposits
and other customer funds through the
branch network and reducing dependence
on the wholesale market.

Since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007 Banco Sabadell’s funding policy
has focused on attracting deposits and other customer funds through its
branches, reducing the total amount of funds raised on the wholesale markets
and increasing the Bank’s liquidity position.

The primary source of the group’s funding is its customer deposit base
(mainly current accounts and time deposits taken through the branch
network). This is supplemented by funds raised on the interbank and capital
markets where the Bank has a number of short- and long-term funding pro-
grammes in place, giving it a suitable diversity of funding sources and products,
maturities and investors.

The Bank's funding arrangements are well-balanced, with 19.7% sourced
from the wholesale market. In 2013 mortgage covered bonds accounted for the
largest share of this funding (62%). The timetable of maturing debt is appro-
priate, with a total of €4,397 million of debt securities maturing in 2014.

The Bank's borrowings from the ECB were substantially reduced from €23,650
million in 2012 to €8,800 million at the end of 2013 thanks to efficient liquidity
management.

As far as its wholesale market funding activities are concerned Banco
Sabadell, like the rest of the banking sector, saw its ratings being downgraded
by the major rating agencies in response to lower sovereign credit ratings for
Spain. In 2013 the three agencies that rated Banco Sabadell’s credit quality
were Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and DBRS. All the agencies have highlighted
the improvement in Banco Sabadell’ solvency position since the capital
increases carried out in September.

Profit performance in 2013

Banco Sabadell’s net profit, at €247.8 million,
is a threefold increase on 2012.

The year-end figure for net interest income
showed a rising trend, reflecting a fall in
the cost of deposits and active management
of interest spreads that helped to improve
the net interest margin.

Personnel and administration expenses,
on a like-for-like basis, were successfully held
down and this, combined with branch
network restructuring, resulted in a significantly
improved cost:income ratio.

Comparable results for the group for the years 2013, Banco Sabadell’s 132nd
year of trading, and 2012 are as follows:

24 Banco Sabadell Annual Report 2013


--- Page 19 ---

— Net interest income amounted to €1,814.7 million in 2013, 2.9% less than in
2012. The contribution from Banco CAM from June 2012 onwards and the
acquisitions of new businesses in 2013 (BMN-Penedés, Sabadell Solbank
and Banco Gallego), combined with judicious management of interest
spreads, improved net profit from the fixed-income portfolio and other
factors broadly offset the effects of the downward shift in the yield curve and
narrowing interest spreads in the first half of the year. In the second half of
the year interest spreads began to improve, mainly due to the lower cost of
deposits and the diminishing effect of the yield curve on loan repricing.

— Astrong sales performance by branches and the new businesses added to
the group drove a steady increase in net fee and commission income which
grew by 20.8% compared with the previous year.

— Net income from trading remained at a high level, totalling €1,479.2
million. Net foreign exchange gains, at €67.9 million, showed an increase
of 13.3% on the year before.

— Contributions to the bank deposit guarantee fund in 2013, a component of
other operating income, totalled €135.4 million.

These factors resulted in a gross income of €3,976.8 million, an increase of
34.4% on the figure for 2012.

— Operating expenses (personnel and general administrative) amounted to
€1,686.1 million. Recurring operating expenses in 2013, on a like-for-like
basis, were 12.5% lower than in the previous year. The main costs excluded
from this are exceptional acquisition-related restructuring costs.

The 34.4% increase in gross income in 2013, coupled with policies to hold
down costs, produced a significantly improved cost:income ratio of 48.68% in
2013 (down from 51.10% in 2012), excluding a one-off capital gain on the sale
of the held-to-maturity portfolio.

All this enabled Banco Sabadell to end the year with a net profit before
provisions of €2,062.3 million, an increase of 59.9% on the figure for 2012.

— Provisions for loan losses and other impairments (primarily in real estate
and financial assets) amounted to €1,763.6 million after a review had been
conducted of classifications of refinanced loans related to new acquisitions.

— Profits on asset disposals amounted to €43.9 million in 2013.

This included a net gain of €25.6 million in December from the disposal of
Banco Sabadell’s stake in the Dominican Republic banking group, Centro
Financiero BHD.

— The “negative goodwill’ item of the 2013 income statement includes a
€30.3 million gain associated primarily with the acquisition of Banco
Gallego. The accounts for 2012 included a €933.3 million negative goodwill
on the consolidation of Banco CAM.

After deducting corporate income tax and the profit attributable to non-

controlling interests, the net profit attributable to the group at 2013 year-end
was €247.8 million, that is, 202.6% higher than the figure for 2012.

Acquisitions in 2013

On 18 December 2012 Banco Sabadell and Banco Mare
Nostrum, S.A. (BMN) reached an agreement for the
transfer to Banco Sabadell of assets and liabilities form-
ing the branch banking business of BMN in the regions of
Catalonia and Aragon (“BMN-Penedés”). On 31 May 2013
the deal completed and Banco Sabadell took control of the
business on 1 June.

Under the agreement Banco Sabadell acquired assets
and liabilities totalling €9,779 million and €9,625 mil-
lion respectively, including €9,433 million in loans and
advances and some €9,200 million in deposits. The €154

Acquisition of Lloyds

million difference between the net assets and the liabili-
ties was the purchase consideration payable to BMN.
The transaction spurred a reorganization of the Banco
Sabadell’s branch network in Catalonia, leading to the
creation of a new Catalonia Regional Division to which
the Banco Sabadell and BMN-Penedés branches were
transferred. The former BMN branches in Aragon were
assigned to the Bank’s existing Northern Regional divi-
sion. These arrangements combine the advantages

of centralized management at regional level with local
specialization to meet the needs of both regions.

This acquisition provides us with an
opportunity to strengthen our franchise in the
non-resident community in Spain and,
at the same time, secure an internationally
renowned partner as a shareholder.

BRANCHES,

On 29 April 2013 the Bank concluded an agreement with
Lloyds TSB Bank Plc to acquire the entire share capital of
its Spanish subsidiaries Lloyds Bank International, S.A.U.
(“LBI”) and Lloyds Investment Espaiia, S.G.LI.C., S.A.U.
(“Lloyds Investment”). On 30 June Banco Sabadell took
control of the two companies involved in the transaction.
After the acquisition the name of LBI was changed to
Sabadell Solbank, S.A-U. The names of subsidiary compa-
nies in the LBI group were also changed. Under the terms
of the deal, Banco Sabadell acquired assets and liabilities
totalling €1,705 million. The acquired business consisted
almost entirely of mortgage loans (97% of all gross loans
and advances, amounting to €1,598 million) and deposits
of individual non-resident account holders.

The purchase consideration for 100% of the shares in
the two Spanish companies was the delivery of 53,749,680

CUSTOMERS

shares in Banco Sabadell from the Bank’s holding of
treasury shares, the fair value of which at the time of tak-
ing control amounted to €68.5 million (€84 million on
the date on which the purchase agreement was signed by
Banco de Sabadell and Lloyds Bank), and the payment to
Banco Sabadell of a cash sum of €1.5 million by way of a
price adjustment.

This shareholding has resulted in Lloyds TSB becom-
ing a stable shareholder: not only has it undertaken not
to transfer the shares received until 30 April 2015, but
along-term strategic alliance in the commercial, corpo-
rate and private banking areas has been agreed between
the Bank and Lloyds TSB. The transaction did not affect
Banco Sabadell’s capital ratios since the holding acquired
by Lloyds Bank absorbs the capital consumed due to the
requirements of the assets acquired.

Gallego, S.A. in a competitive auction to sell off the
business. It then went into negotiations with Spain’s Fund
for Orderly Bank Restructuring (FROB) on the possi-

ble terms of a purchase deal. On 19 April 2013 Banco
Sabadell’s bid for Banco Gallego was accepted anda

shares in Banco Gallego, S.A. for a consideration of one
euro. The purchase was subject to the condition that

The intention is that Banco Gallego, S.A. and Sabadell-

Corporate Banking and Global Businesses in 2013

The year 2013 was a year of transformation for Corpo-
rate Banking marked by a change in strategic focus and
achange of organizational culture to enhance our ability
to deliver excellence to customers operating in a global
market.

Structured Finance

In the international sphere we strengthened our position
in the US, where we embarked on a key project to take part
in loan syndication deals in Mexico. Our new business as
an operator on Spain’s alternative fixed-income market
(“MARF”) made a good start.

Banco Sabadell, once again,
a Spanish market leader
in Structured Finance.

Corporate Finance

The year saw the successful completion of four transac-
tions in the aeronautical engineering, civil/harbour engi-
neering, underground parking lot and real estate sectors.

Development capital

Acting through two subsidiaries, Aurica XXI, SCR de
Régimen Simplificado, S.A. and Sinia Renovables,

SCR de Régimen Simplificado, S.A. the Bank supports
the growth of non-financial companies by providing
short-term capital and active assistance. This support was
continued in 2013.

Development capital

The Bank’s international trade business had another very
busy year, thanks in part to the growth in exports. Banco
Sabadell has always been a pioneer in seeking a presence
in foreign markets such as China, where it has two offices
(in Shanghai and Beijing), India, Singapore, Turkey,

the United Arab Emirates and Algeria. Its foreign branch-
es and offices continue to offer significant added value to
the international operations of Spanish businesses. Its
Casablanca branch, the first to be opened in Morocco by a
Spanish bank, met all the targets set for it and continued
to make solid progress.

Consumer Finance-SabadellFincom

The prolonged contraction in consumer demand did
nothing to prevent SabadellFincom from continuing to
grow in both revenue and market share compared with the
previous year. Additionally it was able to reduce customer
default levels to 4.99% and build up provisions to 105%

of doubtful loans.

The Bank won awards from the
British specialist corporate finance magazine
Acquisition International

(being named “M&A Advisory Firm of the Year - Spain”
and “Corporate Finance Firm of the Year - Spain”).

Markets and Private Banking in 2013
SabadellUrquijo Private Banking

Sabadell Urquijo Private Banking is the division of Banco
Sabadell specialized in serving the group's private bank-
ing clients. Much work was done in 2013 to raise public
awareness of SabadellUrquijo Private Banking as a leading
player in serving high-income clients. Business increased
by 4.7% over the year to reach a total of €23,963 million
and a total of more than 28,700 private banking clients.

Investment, Products and Research

The division continued to focus on financial market
analysis and research to identify the right asset allocation
strategies as a guide to investment policy and product
planning. This last activity proved to be particularly im-
portant and beneficial in 2013 now that we are seeing an
upturn in expectations for economic growth on the
European periphery that had been anticipated and fac-
tored into our investment recommendations.

Assets under management in Spanish-domiciled
mutual funds of financial assets amounted to €6,255.5
million, up 40.8% on the previous year’s total for Spanish-
domiciled funds.

Treasury and Capital Markets

In 2013 despite the continued weakness of the economy
and a financial environment characterized by interest
rates falling to all-time lows, the division was able to meets
its targets thanks to persistent sales efforts and an increase
in business activity by customers in foreign markets lead-
ing to a corresponding increase income from FX products.
Banco Sabadell was the first bank to be approved as a reg-
istered member and investment advisor by MARF, Spain's
new alternative bond market, to be able to offer businesses
a complete service in all areas of finance. In 2013 the Bank
was the first Spanish bank to join EurexOTC Clear for
interest rate swaps (IRS's), thus anticipating the coming
into force of new regulations on trading IRS's through
clearing houses.

Securities trading and custodian services
2013 was a year of recovery in volumes and asset values
and this provided a substantial boost to the group's securi-

ties business, which saw growth in both volumes and
margins compared with the previous year (see Figure F6).

In 2013 Banco Sabadell mutual funds
earned outstanding accolades. Sabadell
Inversion was the only Spanish-domiciled
fund manager to be awarded a high
qualitative grading by Standard & Poor’s
Capital IQ Fund Research.

Banco Sabadell confirmed its position
as a market leader by trading volume, taking
second position among Spanish market
members with a share of more than 9.5%.

Asset Management in 2013

Commercial sales of

real estate more
targets in 2013

than met their
and continued

to outpace the market.

The year 2013 saw sales of real estate assets increase by
40% on the previous year to a total of €3,120 million on
higher-than-expected sales of 18,501 units.

Key developments on the marketing front in 2013
included the launch of a special international channel de-
signed to sell properties to residents of foreign countries;
and an “open platform” arrangement under which, for
optimum marketing efficiency, properties could be offered
to the market by more than one agent.

Solvia Inmobiliaria is currently Spain’s second larg-
est bank-operated real estate web site and ninth largest
real estate web portal. It is also the country’s second most

widely recognized brand in the residential property and
construction sectors, with a 40% brand awareness rate
among potential property purchasers.

In addition, a number of measures were taken to add
value to the properties being offered for sale and this made
it possible to raise prices for the first time since 2007.

The year 2013 saw an upturn in investment in the
wholesale real estate market. Banco Sabadell completed
anumber of sales of property portfolios. These sales
included one portfolio of some 1,000 residential proper-
ties and portfolios of assets previously written off, building
plots and office building developments.

Sabadell America in 2013

Banco Sabadell’s business in the US amounts to more than
USD 8,000 million with total assets of USD 6,200 million,
making it Florida’s seventh largest local bank by total assets.

Banco Sabadell Miami Branch

At the close of the year Banco Sabadell’s operating branch
in Miami had more than USD 5,500 million in customer
deposits and funds under management. Client portfolio
management was up 45%. In 2013 the Miami branch
continued to provide finance for projects in the energy and
tourism sectors, mainly in the US and Mexico.

In November it acquired the assets and liabilities of
Lloyds TSB Bank's branch in Miami. The takeover accoun-
ted for a large part of the growth in Banco Sabadell’s US
business during the year.

Sabadell United Bank

During the year Sabadell United Bank made further
progress in implementing its operating and sales efficiency
drive, with a particular emphasis on promoting its mort-
gage plan to customers and developing alternative sales
and customer service channels. As 2013 drew to a close, it
was managing assets of some USD 3,866 million with de-
posits close to USD 3,200 million and loans and advances

approaching USD 2,900 million. It was serving more than
45,000 customers. Sabadell United Bank reported a net
profit for 2013 of USD 45 million.

In December it signed an agreement to purchase
Miami-based JGB Bank whose total assets amount to
some USD 500 million. It is expected that the transaction
will complete and that JGB Bank will be merged with
Sabadell United Bank and integrated on its systems in the
course of 2014.

Sabadell Securities

Sabadell Securities USA Inc., an SEC-registered invest-
ment consultancy, operates as a stockbroker and advisor
to securities market investors. The business is both a
complement to and a strengthening factor in the BS
America strategy.

Other businesses
BancSabadell d’Andorra

Operations

The integration of branches acquired from
BMN-Penedes was successfully accomplished,
as operating and IT systems were merged
and the change of brand was completed.

2013 was the last year of the “CREA” 3-year plan, designed
to bring about a transformation of the group's operating
and business processes. The plan has given the Bank the
tools and resources it needs to increase productivity and
accommodate the anticipated growth in customer num-
bers while maintaining the high-quality service that is the
group’s hallmark. This has meant giving greater visibility
to income generation and striving even harder to manage
down costs and bad debts.

Operational and organization change

To enable branches to focus their efforts on purely
business-related tasks, action was taken during the year to
reduce the administrative workload at branches by
concentrating administrative tasks at dedicated central
units. A system of sales incentives was also developed to
promote a more sales-oriented approach.

Administrative workload at branches reduced as work
transferred to Regional Administrative Centres (RACs)

96% of service-related transactions

91% of product-elated transactions

Technology

First, the integration of assets acquired from BMN-
Penedés in 2013 and the increase in customers and busi-
ness resulting from the takeover of Banco CAM in Decem-
ber 2012 made it necessary to upgrade Banco Sabadell’s IT
systems to obtain a very considerable increase in process-
ing capacity. Increased capacity was required not only in
the banking IT system to accommodate a twofold increase
in activity, but in the IT systems running the BS Online
and BS Mévil online banking services, which saw in-
creased usage of 44% and 75% respectively. There was also
room for some technological innovation during the year,
including such state-of-the art projects as an e-banking
app for Google Glass that is without equal in Spain.

Human Resources
Employee training

The Bank continued its policy of providing training for all
group employees, achieving high levels of participation.
This included a highly successful programme to train new
employees entering the organization as a result of recent
acquisitions. These employees were supported by tutors
assigned to newly integrated branches. In-service train-
ing was extended across the entire branch network, with
more than 6,207 employees taking part. This included the
“Laude” programme, an arrangement with the University
of Barcelona to award university qualifications to employ-
ees successfully completing in-house training courses.

Human resources development

At senior management level fresh progress was made

in the group’s approach to executive training, including
360-degree assessments in a continuation of the Executive
Leadership Programme with 254 senior managers taking
part, and a Senior Management Audit and Assessment
exercise to draw up management structures for the new
Catalonia and Northwest regional divisions. Other key
training actions included online and attendance-based
training for 400 managers from the group's Central Ser-
vices divisions. Our Business Development Programme
helped branch employees meet the challenges of adapting

to the new approach to customer relationship manage-
ment and business development; a third Corporate
Management Programme (CMP) provided recently
appointed middle-management employees with the new
management and leadership skills expected of a Banco
Sabadell executive.

Executive remuneration

During the year, as permitted by the regulations on
remuneration enacted by the European authorities and
the legislation implementing these in Spain, and with the
authority of a resolution of the General Meeting, the group
approved the use of options on Banco Sabadell shares as

a form of payment of variable compensation accruing in
the year 2012, to which directors and employees subject to
regulatory oversight have voluntarily agreed.

Banco CAM Assistance Plan

The assistance plan linked to the redundancy proce-
dure applicable to employees of the former Banco CAM
comprised two simultaneous initiatives: first, a plan to
revitalize business in the levant regions and, second, an
outplacement scheme that has enabled 33% of ex-
employees enrolled in the scheme to find other jobs.

Quality Management

For Banco Sabadell, quality is not just a strategic option;
rather, it is a whole approach to doing business, whether in
delivering value to stakeholders or in the execution of each
and every process forming a part of that business.

The Bank measures itself by a number of standards
and benchmarks to be sure that its way of doing business
is the right one, and it sets itself new targets based on
continual self-criticism. This effort is reflected in a num-
ber of certificates and awards.

Quality in customer service

Banco Sabadell is a Spanish market leader in quality of
service and customer satisfaction ratings from both busi-
ness and individual customers. Professionalism, care and
attention to detail, and insistence on best practice are the
group's defining values.

To make this possible, the Bank carries out regular
studies that enable it to identify areas for improvement as

they develop, both throughout the whole organization and

at each individual branch. These include branch quality
audits and customer satisfaction surveys (see Figure 5).

Customer and user protection

Any customer or user of group services can contact the
Customer Service Department (CSD) if they have a com-
plaint or a claim that cannot be settled with the branch in
the normal way.

The CSD is independent from the business and opera-
tional side of the group and is governed by the group’s own
rules and procedures on customer and user protection
(see Figures 2, 3 and 4.)

Qualis Awards for Excellence

Of particular interest are the prizes awarded to the best
bank branches, as examples of successful teamwork. This
year’s winners were the branches at la Jonquera, Illescas,
Alhaurin el Grande, and Segorbe and the Elche-Parque
Empresarial and Palma de Mallorca business branches.
The Qualis Gold Prize, which is given in recognition of a
person's past career, was awarded to Luciano Méndez
Sanchez, head of Caribbean Business.

Employee participation for improvement and innovation

During the year 2013 a total of 4,129 employees posted
messages on BS Idea, the group's Web 2.0-based collabo-
rative platform, contributing 2,656 ideas.

Risk management

Consultancy Oliver Wyman was commissioned
by Banco Sabadell to conduct a stress test
to measure the resilience of its balance sheet
in the period June to December 2016.

In anticipation of tests of balance-sheet resilience under
different stress scenarios which the European Central
Bank is to carry out on European banks in 2014 in coor-
dination with the European Banking Authority, Banco
Sabadell engaged consultancy Oliver Wyman to conduct
its own internal stress test. The test measured the re-
silience of Banco Sabadell’s balance sheet in the period
June 2013 to December 2016 under two specified mac-
roeconomic scenarios: one central and one pessimistic.
The result was that, over the test period, Banco Sabadell
was found to have a loss absorption capacity and a capital
surplus (to cover losses in the loan book and the foreclosed
asset portfolio) of 24,800 million and 5,800 million,
respectively, under the central scenario and 25,300 and
2,400 million under the pessimistic scenario.

The chief categories of risk inherent in the business of
Banco Sabadell and its group are credit risk, market risk
and operational risk.

The accurate and efficient management and con-
trol of risk is critical to realizing the aim of maximizing
shareholder value while ensuring an appropriate degree
of financial strength. The management and control of
risk comprises a broad framework of principles, policies,
procedures and advanced evaluation methodologies,
integrated within an efficient decision-making structure.
These are fully and clearly set out in the Annual Accounts,
the Report of the Directors, the Report on Corporate Gov-
ernance and the Basel Pillar 3 Disclosures, all of which can
be found on the group's web site.

Banco Sabadell complies with guidelines drawn up un-
der the Basel Capital Accord, a fundamental principle of
which is that a bank’s capital requirements should be more
closely related to risks actually incurred, based on internal
risk measurement models which have been independently
validated. The Bank has supervisory approval for the use
ofits own internal models in estimating its regulatory
capital requirements (see Figure F3 & F4).

Credit risk

Credit risk is the possibility that losses may be incurred

as a result of borrowers failing to meet their obligations

or through losses in value due simply to deterioration in
borrower quality.

To maximize the business opportunities provided by
each customer and to guarantee an appropriate degree
of security, responsibility for monitoring risks is shared
between the relationship manager and the risk analyst,
who are thus able to obtain a comprehensive view of each
customer's individual circumstances.

The Board of Directors delegates powers and discre-
tions to the Risk Control Committee, which then sub-del-
egates authority at each level. The addition of controls on
these authority thresholds to loan approval management
systems ensures that the powers delegated at each level
are appropriate to the expected loss estimates for all loan
applications by business customers.

The establishment of effective processes for managing
existing risk exposures also benefits the process of man-
aging past due accounts, since the early identification of
probable default cases ensures that measures can be taken
proactively. With an early warning system, the quality of
arisk can be monitored in an integrated way and risks
transferred to recovery specialists who are best equipped
to determine the most suitable type of recovery procedure
in each case (see Figure F1 & F2).

Country risk

This is the risk of incurring loss from exposures to sov-
ereign borrowers or to persons domiciled in a particular
country, for reasons connected with national sovereignty
or the economic situation of the country. Country limits
are approved by the Risk Control Committee and are
constantly monitored to ensure that any deterioration in
the political, economic or social situation in a country can
be detected in good time (see Figure F5).

Credit risk in market trading

This is the risk associated with trading in financial instru-
ments in market transactions with financial counterpar-
ties and in the fixed-income portfolio. Banco Sabadell
has a system in place for assessing and managing these
risks which allows compliance with approved limits to be
monitored and controlled on a daily basis. In addition, to
mitigate exposure to counterparty risk Banco Sabadell
maintains netting agreements negotiated with the major-
ity of its counterparties. The collateral provisions of these
agreements ensure that exposure to such counterparties is
significantly reduced (see Figure F6 & F7).

Market risk
Discretionary market risk

Discretionary market risk arises from the possibility of loss
in the value of financial asset positions due to variations in

any of the factors affecting market risk (stock prices, inter-
est rates, exchange rates or credit spreads).

Discretionary market risk is measured, in most cases,
by the VaR (Value at Risk) method, which allows the risks
on different types of financial market transaction to be
analysed as a single class. VaR limits are approved by the
Risk Control Committee and are assigned on a top-down
basis, with the overall limit being divided into sub-limits for
different business units and risk factors down to individual
portfolio level. In addition to VaR limits other types of limit
are applied, such as sensitivity, nominal value and stop-loss
limits; these, along with VaR, ensure that a complete as-
sessment of market risk exposure can be obtained. Market
risk is monitored on a daily basis and reports on current
risk levels and on compliance with the limits assigned to
each unit are sent to the relevant control functions. The
following graph (F8) shows the movement of the 1-day
VaR for trading operations by the group's treasury market
operations in the year 2013 at a 99% confidence level.

Structural interest rate and liquidity risk
Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is caused by changes, as reflected in the
position or the slope of the yield curve, in the interest rates
to which asset, liability and off-balance sheet positions

are linked. Gaps or mismatches arise between these items
because of differences in repricing and maturity dates so
that rate changes affect them at different times; this in turn
affects the robustness and stability of results. The sensitiv-
ity of net interest income and shareholders’ equity to a 100
basis point change in interest rates for the years 2012 and
2013 is illustrated in the following diagram (F9).

Liquidity risk

This can be defined as the possibility of the Bank's being
unable to meet payment commitments, even if only tem-
porarily, due to a lack of liquid assets or of its being unable
to access the markets to refinance debts at a reasonable
cost. Liquidity risk may be caused by external factors such
as a financial market downturn, a systemic crisis or repu-
tational issues, or internally, by an excessive concentra-
tion of maturing liabilities. Banco Sabadell keeps a close
watch on day-to-day changes in its liquid asset position
and holds a diversified portfolio of such assets. It assesses
the quality of its portfolio of liquid assets by studying the
sensitivity of these assets to different scenarios. In addi-
tion, liquidity gap analysis is used to manage foreseeable
mismatches between cash inflows and outflows over a
medium-term horizon.

The Bank carries out regular liquidity stress testing
exercises to enable it to assess inflows and outflows of
funds and the impact of these flows on its cash position
under different scenarios. It has a contingency plan to
respond to unexpected scenarios that could cause an im-
mediate funding requirement.

oct nov dec

Operational risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inad-
equate or failed internal processes, people and systems or
from unforeseen external events. Banco Sabadell pays par-
ticular attention to operational risk and has implemented
a management, measurement and oversight framework
that fulfils the conditions necessary to opt for the use of an
advanced model for calculating regulatory capital charges
for operational risk.

Senior managers and the Board of Directors play a
direct, hands-on role in managing operational risk by ap-
proving the management framework and its implementa-
tion as proposed by an Operational Risk Committee made
up of senior managers from different functional areas
of the company; they also ensure that regular audits are
carried out on the management strategy being applied,
the reliability of the information being reported, and the
internal validation tests required by the operational risk
model. The group has a specialized central unit to manage
operational risk, whose main functions are to coordinate,
supervise and drive forward the identification, assessment
and management of risks by process managers in line with
Banco Sabadell’s process-based approach.

The database contains historical records of actual
losses resulting from operational risk going back to 2002.
It is constantly being updated as information is received on
losses and also on recoveries, whether resulting from the
Bank’s own efforts or from insurance provision.

Compliance risk

Compliance risk is the risk of incurring legal or adminis-
trative sanctions, significant financial loss or reputational
damage as a result of an infringement of laws, regulations,
internal procedures and banking industry codes of conduct.

The Banco Sabadell group has installed a more robust
and effective control infrastructure in all areas where a
compliance risk may be present, such as prevention of
money laundering and the financing of terrorism, market
abuse, internal codes of conduct and investor protection
(MiFID). Key actions implemented in 2013 included the
following:

— Constantly updated anti-money laundering,
Know-your-Customer and customer acceptance
systems and procedures.

— Expanded and more rigorous measures to bring
greater transparency to all dealings with customers,
particularly in the marketing of products and the
terms of contracts.

— Improving investor protection by implementing
new procedures to evaluate the timeliness and
suitability of investments.

— Establishing stronger mechanisms for detecting
possible market abuse.

— Strengthening the system for overseeing compliance
with the group’s Internal Code of Conduct for trading
on the securities market.

— Driving and verifying implementation of the Foreign
Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).

Corporate Social
Responsibility



--- Page 49 ---

Banco Sabadell seeks to respond to society’s aspirations
and concerns by accepting its responsibilty as a driver of
the economy and carrying on its business in an ethical
and responsible way.

In 2013 the Bank approved a Corporate Social
Responsibility Master Plan reaffirming the values and
ethical principles that govern its actions, at atime when
there was a need to show commitment to maintaining
the trust and reliance placed on it by stakeholders.

The Plan comprises five main action areas:

1 Responsible banking: Strengthening the ethical
dimension to all our activities in a transparent way.
Minimizing the impacts of our operations and
contributing to the development of the community.

2 Ahealthy organization: Encouraging a sense of pride
and of belonging on the part of employees.

3 Environmental sustainability: Minimizing the environ-
mental impacts of our facilities and our business.

4 Acculture of social responsibility: Raising the profile
of professional ethics through accurate and transpar-
ent reporting.

5 Shared value: Building alliances with our stakeholders.

Responsible banking
Commitment to business ethics

For Banco Sabadell it is of vital importance to ensure the
strictest compliance with legal requirements and with
the policies, internal procedures and codes of conduct that
guarantee ethnical and responsible conduct at all levels of
the organization.

For this reason the Bank has since 2003 had codes of
conduct and stakeholder policies that apply throughout
the organization and extend to all group activities.

Transparency and financial education

Banco Sabadell seeks to protect the interests of its custom-
ers and has control mechanisms in place to supervise the
products and services it offers:

— Personalized information to ensure that customers
take informed decisions.

— Tests of suitability and appropriateness for complex
financial products.

— Responsible advertising: we have been subscribers to
Autocontrol (an advertising self-regulatory organiza-
tion) since 2010.

— Support for the National Plan for Financial Education.

— Creating our own initiatives on financial education:
paraquesirveeldinero.com, an online personal finance
tool, and the audiovisual campaign “How long are we
going to live?”

Corporate Social Responsibility

Impact on society

The Bank strives to create wealth in the Spanish economy
within a framework of sustainable growth: 18,077 people
directly employed; more than €1,135 million in staff

pay and social welfare contributions; and €1,267 million
in procured goods and services.

Promoting economic development

— More than €5,000 million in new medium- and
long-term finance for sole proprietors and companies.

— Spain's second largest distributor of ICO-sponsored
financing, with a 20.5% market share.

— The launch of BStartup and BStartup 10, designed to
help entrepreneurs create their business plans.

— Continued development of the “Export For Growth”
programme to promote internationalization of small
and medium-sized business.

Minimizing the impacts on people
affected by restructuring

Banco Sabadell has organized an assistance programme
to mitigate the impact of redundancies following the
takeover of Banco CAM:

— An outplacement programme continuing until March
2014 for 1,250 employees made redundant: 316 former
bank employees are enrolled in the scheme, which
includes advice to employees and their spouses on
finding employment. 33% of employees enrolled in the
scheme have already found work.

— Arevitalization plan to restore former levels of employ-
ment in the affected region: 629 jobs were created in
the levant regions with the help of financial subsidies
for newly-created jobs, the provision of finance on
favourable terms and other measures.

Preventing social exclusion

— Special assistance for customers at risk from social
exclusion.

— The Bank offers solutions other than repossession for
mortgage defaulters: extensions of repayment terms,
grace periods and interest rate reviews. There are no
forced repossessions.

— Banco Sabadell has signed up to the Spanish
government-sponsored Code of Good Banking
Practice and Agreement for the Creation of a Social
Fund for Housing.

— Contributing 260 residential units to the Social Fund
for Housing and providing 186 residential units free
of charge for the use of charitable organizations
helping people in difficulty.

its forms.

The Bank has established due diligence rules and
procedures to keep a watch on the accounts it manages
and to detect all activities related to money laundering
or the financing of terrorism.

Responsible finance

The Equator Principles: in 2014 assessments of envi-
ronmental and social risks will be extended to
corporate loans in addition to the assessments already
being applied to the financing of large projects.

New global energy model: investing in and providing
finance for renewable energy sources.

Socially responsible investment: more than €70,000
donated to NGOs from the proceeds of three socially
responsible investment products marketed by the
Bank. These products exclude investments in contro-
versial areas of business and give preference to compa-
nies included in the FTSE4GOOD stock market index.
