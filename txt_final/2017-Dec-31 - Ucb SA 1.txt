This Business Performance Review is based on the
consolidated financial statements for the UCB Group
of companies prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The separate statutory financial statements of UCB
SA prepared in accordance with Belgian Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles, together with the
report of the Board of Directors to the General
Assembly of Shareholders, as well as the auditors’
report, will be filed at the National Bank of Belgium
within the statutory periods, and be available on
request or on our website.

Scope change: As a result of the divestment of the
activities Films (September 2004), Surface Specialties
(February 2005), and the divestiture of Kremers Urban
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (November 2015), UCB reports
the results from those activities as a part of profit from
discontinued operations.

Recurring and non-recurring: Transactions and
decisions of a one-time nature that affect UCB's
results are shown separately (“non-recurring items)
Besides EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes or
operating profit), a line for “recurring EBIT” (REBIT or
recurring operating profit), reflecting the on-going
profitability of the company’s biopharmaceutical
activities, is included. The recurring EBIT is equal to the
line “operating profit before impairment, restructuring
and other income and expenses” reported in the
consolidated financial statements

Core EPS is the core profit, or the profit attributable
to the UCB shareholders, adjusted for the after-tax
impact of non-recurring items, the financial one-
offs, the after-tax contribution from discontinued
operations and the after-tax amortization of
intangibles linked to sales, per non-dilutive weighted
average number of shares.

Regulatory update and pipeline progress

NEUROLOGY

* In January 2017, UCB filed a supplemental New
Drug Application with the U.S. authorities for
Briviact® (brivaracetam) as monotherapy in the
treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients
16 years of age and older with epilepsy and was
approved in the U.S. in September.
In July, UCB filed a marketing authorization in the
EU for Briviact® for children with epilepsy of 4 years
of age and older, for the adjunctive treatment of
partial-onset seizures and with the U.S. authorities
for the monotherapy and adjunctive treatment

In February, the Phase 2a study with padsevonil
(UCB0942) - aimed at highly drug resistant epilepsy
patients, who failed four anti-epileptic drugs and
have at least four seizures/week - showed positive
top line results and will progress into further
development. Detailed results were presented at the
American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in
December 2017. Phase 2b started in February 2018
with first results expected in H1 2020.

ln March, Vimpat® (lacosamide) was filed in the
U.S. for children living with partial-onset epilepsy at
4 years and older, based on extrapolation of data
from adult patients. In September and November,
Vimpat® was approved in the EU and the U.S.
respectively for the treatment of partial onset
epilepsy in children from 4 to 16 years of age

Also in March, Vimpat® in a Phase 3 study achieved
positive results as adjunctive therapy in patients
with epilepsy (partial-onset seizure; > 4 to <17 years
of age). Detailed results will be presented at

future scientific meetings and will be submitted to
regulatory authorities.

In August, the Japanese health authorities approved
Vimpat® for use as monotherapy for partial-onset
seizure in adult patients with epilepsy.

In January 2018, UCB filed Vimpat® for pediatric
patients living with partial-onset epilepsy from

4 years of age and older in Japan.


--- Page 4 ---

* In March, a Phase 2a study started with
rozanolixizumab (UCB7665) in myasthenia gravis
(MQ), a rare, debilitating neurological auto-immune
disease. First results are expected in H2 2018

All other clinical development programs in neurology
are continuing as planned.

IMMUNOLOGY

« UCB and its partner Dermira submitted a marketing
application to EU and U.S. regulatory authorities
for Cimzia® (certolizumab pegol) in psoriasis
which were accepted for filing in August and
October, respectively.
In February, to support line extension for Japan, a
Phase 3 study evaluating Cimzia® in adult patients
with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis started with first
results expected in Q3 2018.
In March 2017, the FDA issued a “complete
response letter” in connection with the review of
a proposed new indication for Cimzia® to treat
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA). The
FDA letter concerns the reliability of the submitted
pharmacokinetic data. UCB is working with the
FDA to agree on next steps to bring Cimzia® to
juvenile patients, with no impact on any other
Cimzia® program
Data from the CRIB and CRADLE studies for women
of child-bearing age were filed with the European
and U.S. health authorities, in Q2 2017. CRIB was
evaluating the transfer of Cimzia® from the mother
to the infant via the placenta while CRADLE was
a study evaluating the concentration of Cimzia®
in mature breast milk of lactating mothers. In
December 2017, the European Medicines Agency
approved a label change for Cimzia®, making it
the first anti-TNF treatment option that could be
considered for women with chronic inflammatory
disease throughout the pregnancy journey.

In July, positive results from a Phase 2b study

in patients with psoriasis were reached for
bimekizumab: At week 12, up to 79% of patients
achieved at least 90% skin clearance, and up to
60% of patients achieved complete skin clearance
(PASI100).

In December, positive results in ankylosing
spondylitis (AS) were reported for bimekizumab
showing statistical significance in multiple dose
groups: the Phase 2b study achieved the primary
endpoint (ASAS40), with up to 47% of patients
receiving bimekizumab achieving at least 40%
improvement in AS symptoms, versus 13% of
patients receiving placebo, at week 12.

Also in December, positive top line results from
the Phase 2b study in psoriatric arthritis (PsA) were
obtained: bimekizumab showed impressive joint
and skin responses for these patients. The study
achieved a stringent primary endpoint, with up to

73

46% of PsA patients who received bimekizumab
experiencing at least 50% improvement in PsA joint
symptoms (ACR50), versus 7% with placebo, at
week 12. Among patients with active skin lesions
(BSA >3), up to 65% of patients who received
bimekizumab also experienced at least 90% skin
clearance (PASI90) versus 7% of patients who
received placebo. These results were achieved in a
mixed patient population, both biologic naive and
previously biologic exposed patients

UCB advanced the bimekizumab Phase 3 clinical
development program with the first Phase 3 study in
psoriasis starting in December 2017; topline results
from this program are expected at the end of 2019.

In December, rozanolixizumab (UCB7665) reached
“proof of concept’ in patients with immune
thrombocytopenia (ITP) based on positive Phase 2a
results in the two initial dose arms. Recruitment

for higher doses is ongoing with further results
expected in Q3 2018

All other clinical development programs in immunoloy
are continuing as planned

BONE

* In May, UCB and Amgen announced that the
Evenity™ (romosozumab) ARCH study met
both primary endpoints and the key secondary
endpoints. At the primary analysis, treatment
with romosozumab for 12 months followed by
alendronate significantly reduced the incidence
of new vertebral fractures through 24 months,
clinical fractures (primary endpoints) and non-
vertebral fractures (key secondary endpoint) in
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high
risk for fracture, compared to alendronate alone.
An imbalance in positively adjudicated
cardiovascular serious adverse events was observed
as a new Safety signal.
In July, the U.S. authorities issued a Complete
Response Letter for the Biologics License
Application for Evenity™ as a treatment for
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Upon
receiving the CRL, 12 months to respond with the
requested data were granted. Amgen and UCB
continue to evaluate all registrational Phase 3
clinical trial safety data to ensure to have the most
comprehensive view and understanding of the
cardiovascular safety signal observed in the active
comparator ARCH study and not in the placebo
controlled FRAME study.
In December, the European Medicines Agency
accepted the Marketing Authorization Application
(MAA) for Evenity™ (romosozumab) for the
treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal
women and in men at increased risk of fracture,
filed by UCB and Amgen.
