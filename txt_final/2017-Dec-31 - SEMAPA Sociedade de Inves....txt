1 ECONOMIC BACKGROUND

The IMF estimates that in 2017 the world economy grew 3.7% vs. 3.2% in 2016, (World Economic Outlook, IMF, January
2018), one of the highest figures since 2010. Over the course of the year, growth forecasts were reviewed upwards
systematically and across the regions.

The role of the central banks in the economic recovery was relevant, by injecting liquidity into the financial markets,
assuming accommodative monetary policies through non-conventional monetary measures.

The European economy was estimated to grow 2.4% in 2017, well above the 1.8% recorded in 2016 (World Economic
Outlook, January 2018). The United Kingdom was the great exception, as a result of the fears and uncertainty generated
by the United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Union. Economic activity in the euro area reflected the results of
some development policies adopted recently, as well as the improvement in the financial conditions and relatively low
oil prices, and the labour market progressively picking up. Such dynamics was boosted by the improvement in the
confidence of economic agents, which reflected the vision that the risks for economic growth are currently more stable.

In 2017, the pace of economic growth in North America picked up (2.3% in 2017 vs. 1.5% in 2016, World Economic
Outlook, IMF, January 2018). The situation in the labour market is very close to full employment. Meanwhile, a new tax
plan has been approved, which will be an important economic support tool, since it may provide an additional thrust to
companies and domestic consumption.

After a 1.5% growth in GDP in 2016, the Portuguese economy is expected to grow 2.6% in 2017 (Bank of Portugal —
Economic Bulletin, December 2017). The improvement in economic performance, and the signs given out that some
imbalances have been corrected, namely the reduction in fiscal imbalance and the public debt ratio, enabled Portugal
to return to investment grade (after S&P, in September, and Fitch, in December, reviewed Portugal's rating upwards).
Such improvement also forced the risk premium of Portuguese public debt vs the German Bund to plummet. However,
Portugal is still one of the countries with the highest public debt ratios (3rd highest in the euro area), which remains
one of the most significant risk factors, possibly impacting the economy negatively in a less favorable global economic-
financial outlook.

As for the exchange market, 2017 featured the appreciation of the euro vis-d-vis other currencies, in particular the
strong appreciation of the Euro vs. the US dollar by approximately 14%. Furthermore, currencies such as the Brazilian
real (BRL) and the Tunisian dinar (TND) depreciated by 14 and 22%, respectively.

As for crude oil prices in 2017, several factors pulled crude oil prices up in the second half of 2017, namely global
improvement in the economic growth outlook, and the extension of the agreement between OPEP countries and Russia,
aimed at reducing daily oil production. Therefore, after beginning the year at 55 USD, the price of Brent dropped to a
minimum level of 44 USD in late June, while in the second half the price picked up and ended the year at 66 USD.

3.3. OVERVIEW OF THE PULP AND PAPER BUSINESS AREA

In 2017, the revenue of Navigator totalled 1,636.8 million euros, up by 3.8% over the same period in the previous year,
sustained essentially by the strong operating performance in sales of pulp, power and tissue.

2017 was a very positive year for pulp; the sector benefited from a series of unexpected developments and several
adjustments which kept supply down and, in combination with vigorous demand, caused prices to rally significantly,
month after month, both in China and in Europe, with the industry experiencing successive price rises. In this context,
Navigator's pulp sales grew by 7% to around 311 thousand tons. The benchmark PIX — BHKP index in euros recorded an
average price of 725 €/ton, as compared to 628 €/ton in the previous year (up by 15%). Navigator's average price also
followed an upward course of 12%, with pulp sales growing by 19% in value, to a total of 164 million euros.

Conditions in the UWF paper market also improved gradually over the year, with progressively stronger order books in
Europe and in overseas markets. In Europe, apparent consumption held steady (up by 0.1%), with demand rising for
Folio and Cutsize, and declining for reels. Navigator recorded strong performance in the volume of paper sales, which
totalled 1,578 thousand tons, roughly equal to the previous year (-8.6 thousand tons; -0.5%), whilst improving its

product mix, in terms of quality (premium sales up by 57 thousand tons) and its own brands (up by 45 thousand tons).

Although the price index for Europe — PIX A4 — evolved positively over the year, average prices in 2017 were still lower
than in 2016 - 815 €/ton vs. 824 €/ton (down 1%). During the year, Navigator successfully implemented four price rises
which allowed it to reverse some of the decline experienced in the final quarter of 2016. However, depreciation of the
EURUSD and EURGBP exchange rates and the evolving market mix did not allow Navigator to completely reverse this
trend, resulting that the Group's average sales prices ended the year practically unchanged in relation to the previous

year.

In the tissue business, the market showed a recovery in demand, driven by economic growth, especially in the tourism
sector. At the same time, competition has increased in the Iberian Peninsula and production costs have also risen,
fuelled by higher pulp prices. In this environment, Navigator recorded an increase in its output of reels and finished
products, benefiting from the expansion in production and converting capacity in 2015. The sales volume was up by 9%
in relation to 2016, with an improvement in the mix of products sold and a reduction in the share of reels in total sales.
This improvement, combined with progressive implementation of price rises starting in October (and continuing in
January), enabled Navigator to record an increase in its average sales price of 1.4%, and sales in value totalling 74.4
million euros (up by 10.3%).

Electricity sales grew by 13% in value in 2017, reflecting successful operation of our power generation assets. It should
be recalled that power sales in 2016 were adversely affected by the stoppage of turbo-generator 3 at the renewable
cogeneration plant in the Setubal pulp mill and the breakdown in turbo-generator 4 at the cogeneration plant in the
Cacia pulp mill. Power sales from the operation of the natural gas combined-cycle power stations also benefited from
the sharp hike in Brent prices (roughly 18% year-on-year), which directly influences the index to which prices are linked.

Navigator's total gross power output in 2017 was up by 5% in 2016. In another important development, 2017 was the
first full year of operation for the solar power plant on the roof of the Setubal paper mill (ATF), operating on a self-
consumption basis.

REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

In its first year of operation in the United States, Colombo Inc. recorded its first pellet sales, achieving a volume of 120.6
thousand tons, and a sales value of approximately 15 million euros. The mill started up in an adverse market
environment and also experienced a number of teething problems in production and in marketing the pellets, which
continued over several months, which led to a negative impact on EBITDA from this business unit of approximately 16
million euros. In December 2017, Navigator signed an agreement to sell its pellets business in the US for about 135
million dollars. The sale was closed on 16 February 2018.

In 2017 EBITDA totalled 403.8 million euros, almost 1.6% up on the figure recorded in the previous year, reflecting an
EBITDA/Sales margin of 24.7%.

Navigator recorded a reduction in variable production costs, in particular for wood (due to the purchasing mix) and also
in logistical and packaging costs. In fixed costs, it should be noted that personnel costs rose by around 11.5 million euros
in 2017, due essentially to a growing workforce in the new businesses (Colombo and tissue), the increase in the pension
fund expenses through a new defined contribution plan extended to all employees in Portugal, and also the values of
the performance bonus payable the following year. Over the course of the year, Navigator has pressed ahead with its
program of cost optimization and efficiency, M2, and results have continued to outperform targets, with an EBITDA
impact of around 27 million euros.

In 2017, depreciations, amortisations and impairment losses of Navigator totalled 160.0 million euros, as compared with
the figure of 181.9 million euros year-on-year. Despite the beginning of new investment depreciations, namely of
Colombo Energy assets, this item was negatively impacted in 2016 by a record of an impairment in the tangible fixed
assets of Mozambique.

Net financial results experienced a positive development, having decreased from a negative figure of 20.8 million euros
in 2016 to -7.7 million euros in 2017. This reduction of roughly 13 million euros in financial costs was achieved essentially
by bringing down borrowing costs, which have continued to evolve very positively: interest expense in 2017 was down
by 4.9 million euros in relation to 2016 (including interest on the High Yield loan, whose payment premium amounted
to 6.4 million euros), in a scenario in which average gross debt was higher than in the previous year. It derives further
from results from currency hedge operations also improving, due to the weaker dollar, with gains up by 6 million euros
in 2016, partially offsetting the negative effect on sales.

Therefore, net results attributable to Navigator shareholders in 2017 amounted to 196.7 million euros, which compares
with a net value of 205.8 million euros in 2016. It is important to note that net income in 2016 was boosted by the
reversal of tax provisions as well as from the effect of the extraordinary tax revaluation regime.

3.4 BUSINESS REVIEW
3.4.1 PULP
3.4.1.1 MARKET BACKGROUND

The year 2017 unfolded positively for the paper pulp business. The paper pulp market behaved dynamically during the
year, consumption having grown approximately 4%, contrasting with the stability of the paper pulp business. This
growth was once more largely driven by the Chinese market, which as in the previous years has been the engine of the
growth of the industry, the paper tissue market having contributed significantly to this positive development. On the
other hand, the paper pulp market profited from several unexpected events which hindered supply significantly,
mitigating the effect of the entry into market of new capacity. Throughout the year, the price of paper pulp increased
consecutively, with the benchmark indicator PIX BHKP in USD rising (on average) 19% in comparison with 2016.

BEKP Sales 311 291 7.0%
Foex — BHKP Euros /ton 725 628 15.4%

In 2017, the paper pulp market represented for Navigator a 7% increase of sales volume (equivalent to 20 thousand
tons). Unlike the UWF (Uncoated Woodfree) market, the paper pulp market has been impacted by the ongoing price
fluctuations, which influenced business profitability. However, Navigator is betting on segments with higher added value
(décor and specialty papers), and is focused on channelling the Group's product to new markets where there is still
room to grow in volume and value.

The year also featured the start of the investment for expanding paper pulp production capacity at the Figueira da Foz
mill, which will grow from the current 580 thousand tons to an annual 650 thousand tons. Such increase in paper pulp
production will help to sustain the current exposure to the paper pulp market, since the Cacia unit will incorporate part
of its paper pulp production in tissue production as from 2018.

3.4.2 PAPER
3.4.2.1 MARKET BACKGROUND

In 2017, the UWF business experienced ongoing improvement of market conditions, presenting stability in global
consumption levels and an increasingly favourable environment for higher prices charged worldwide. Consumption in
the Asian market, China in particular, grew significantly, the consumption of higher quality paper having increased 2%,
which offset the drop in the American market (-6.2%). In Europe, apparent consumption of UWF remained stable, while

the Cutsize and Folio segments were up and reels were down.

Europe is still Navigator's main market; 54% of sales to the continent in 2017 were in the premium segment. The
Company's presence in this market stands out for its differentiated product, with added value and high quality, which
helped it achieve higher profit margins in a highly competitive and demanding market in terms of product and service

quality.

The challenges never stop and new business opportunities for Navigator are always popping up. The new products
developed in 2017, such as Navigator Premium Inkjet, Navigator and Soporcet Digital and paper bags, provide significant

growth opportunities.

Navigator's sales volume amounted to 1,578 thousand tons in 2017, practically in line with the previous year, although
its product mix improved, in quality terms and concerning own brands. The sale of Navigator's own brands actually grew
more than 7% vs. 2016, representing 62% of all sales. Ongoing improvement of market conditions allowed the reference
price indicator for Europe (PIX A4) to evolve positively, having grown 4.1% since the beginning of the year. However, in
spite of the growth, the average value of the price indicator in 2017 still fell short of 2016.

REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

Another important strategic decision to expand this segment, which marked 2017, was the investment in the paper pulp
Cacia mill, which will allow it to double production volume again and develop a tissue production unit fully integrated
in this unit, from paper pulp production to reel production and conversion into end products. Navigator's competitive
edge is hereby reinforced in the market; thanks to an increasingly integrated operation it can offer a high quality product
made from exquisite raw material, with state-of-the-art machinery, and at low costs.

3.5 DEVELOPMENT

Navigator's capital expenditure in 2017 totalled around 115 million euros. Two major development projects -
construction of a new tissue mill in Cacia (with reel production and converting capacity) and improvements to pulp
production efficiency and environmental performance at the Figueira da Foz mill - accounted for more than two thirds
of this figure. These capex projects got under way in 2017 and will continue into 2018, involving total investment of
approximately 205 million euros (120 million euros in Cacia and 85 million euros in Figueira da Foz), of which 70 million
euros has already been spent.

In 2017, the project to expand capacity in Figueira da Foz represented investment of 40 million euros and the new tissue
mill in Cacia approximately 30 million euros. Recurrent investment in pulp and paper business totalled 41 million euros
and the current tissue operation in Vila Velha de Rodao and others, about 4 million euros.

PELLETS

Asa result of the ongoing search and discovery of new business opportunities, Navigator invested in the North-American
market by building a pellet plant, which was completed at the end of 2016, with a total investment amounting to 120
million USD. This was a very attractive business with great growth potential, in an area related to its core business,
energy, which made it possible to diversify its industrial asset base outside of Portugal.

As the operation went on and following the severe deterioration of the international pellet market conditions, it was
quickly seen that there were no significant synergies with other businesses in the Company's portfolio. The decision to
sell the asset prevailed when an attractive financial opportunity to disinvest came up. Consequently, in December 2017,
a sales agreement was signed with a joint venture managed by an entity of Enviva Holdings, LP, for approximately 135
million USD.

In spite of the decision to end its involvement in this business, the Company acknowledges that there are great lessons
to be learnt from the whole situation, and today it is more knowledgeable about the North-American market and
investing in an industrial operation outside of Portugal.

MOZAMBIQUE

Mozambique is one of the markets on the Group's roadmap to international growth, which is founded on the
development plan for its forestry base. On the other hand, its characteristics turn the project quite interesting from the
perspective of the strategy's assumptions: high forest productivity, greater proximity to main target markets (China),
and the competitive cost of land.

This project features a strong commitment to the local communities, where Navigator's value proposal is based on four
fundamental areas: more jobs in production, support to own agriculture, health and education.

REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

The partnership with the World Bank through the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which holds a share in
Portucel Mogambique, provides fundamental support and bears witness to the social participation and the high
standards of the Group's operations in the Country.

Whereas 2016 was a year strongly marked by a very unstable political and economic framework, 2017 featured stability
in forestry operations and a reduction in the pace of investment in Mozambique, since the Group chose to adopt a more
conservative approach and carry out its projects in stages. At this moment, Navigator is developing a project that is
essentially a forestry venture, with the future option of industrial development involving construction of a large-scale
pulp mill.

This approach led to the recording of several impairments in relation to investment in Mozambique, so that in December
2017 the balance sheet value represented less than 1% of total consolidated assets. During the year, the Group incurred
in expenses of a net amount of 8.8 million euros with its operations in Mozambique, with 4.1 million euros registered
as costs, impacting negatively the EBITDA.

If the conditions to proceed with the projects are met (such conditions being currently discussed with the Government
of Mozambique), the first stage must include the development of a production and export operation for eucalyptus
wood chip geared essentially to the Asian market. This is expected to continue until 2023, whereas the second stage —
investing in a large-scale paper pulp mill — will be implemented by 2030.

3.6 RESOURCES AND SUPPORTING FUNCTIONS

3.6.1 SUSTAINABILITY

Despite the Sustainability Report that will be disclosed, note that across the Company, sustainability is one of the pillars
most present in the day-to-day life of the Group's workers. The following are the six pillars of Sustainability: strategic
action pillars help create value, efficiency, innovation, fair trade relations, development of high quality product, and
talent promotion.

In 2017, Navigator consolidated, in a structured and lasting fashion, its Sustainable practices. In this regard, the
Sustainability Forum is held every year. It is chaired by the CEO of Navigator and includes experts of recognized standing,
aimed at fostering discussions and cooperation with the main stakeholders in the relevant Sustainability matters.

The Company's Sustainability Report highlights the commitments and goals underpinning its strategic development with
regard to the sustainability performance. The report is published every two years using the increasingly demanding rules
of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and highlights a set of performance indicators considered to be most relevant.
This sustainability document contributes to reinforcing the credibility and comparability of Navigator's sustainability
reporting, helping to disseminate responsible practices to its stakeholders.

The Company's Sustainability Report for the two-year period 2016-2017 is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development of the United Nations and with topical subjects, from climate change to circular economy, including the
conservation of biodiversity and innovation.

3.6.2 FORESTRY AND TIMBER SUPPLY
SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT

The forest is one of Navigator's most precious assets, which is why it is the object of ongoing attention and concern. The
sustainability of the forest industry is deemed crucial and part of the DNA of the Company. Consequently a set of
initiatives that extend beyond its restricted business model are carried out in view of promoting best forestry
exploitation practices, not only in their areas, but also at the level of the forest countrywide. As the biggest Portuguese
owner of forest land, Navigator manages approximately 112 thousand hectares on mainland Portugal and Azores,
spread across 1,400 Management Units in 173 municipalities. Approximately 3/4 of this area is covered in eucalyptus
trees. In addition to the conservation areas that occupy 10% of the Company's estate, the Group also owns pine and
cork-oak forests and is the largest private pine producer in the Country, and one of the Country's largest oak forest
producers.

Viveiros Alianga, S.A. is in charge of producing forest and ornamental plants for Navigator. It is one of the Group's
companies with over three decades of activity and is among Europe's largest forest nurseries. In 2017, the Company
produced over 12 million plants of over 100 different species.

Navigator conducted in 2017 several public awareness campaigns aimed at informing about the importance of forests
for social sustainability, and also highlighting that Eucalytpus globulus used in its products is an excellent and highly
sustainable raw material.

It has managed to secure its certificates through two world-reference programs: FSC® (Forest Stewardship Council) and
PEFC™ (Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification schemes). Navigator holds 27% of all certified forest area
in Portugal (29% FSC® and 44% PEFC™), given that the company's entire forest area is certified by these two programs.

The Group's attachment to the forest is also reflected in the way it regards its social responsibility policy. After the wild
fires in 2017, the Company put forward a joint initiative with Altri and allocating to each company 500 thousand euros
for supporting the victims. Part of this support was implemented under the protocol that the Company concluded with
the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation.

In the area of wild fire prevention and fighting, the important role of AFOCELCA must be highlighted. Founded in 2002,
it joined Navigator and Altri and, through its professional structure, it is mandated to fight wild fires on the properties
of the associated companies, in close cooperation with the National Civil Protection Authority. AFOCELCA is present
throughout the Country and is equipped with human and material resources. Most of the times it represents primary
intervention against wild fire. Teams' knowledge in sighting and fighting wild fires is crucial; 85% of intervention is
carried out outside of Navigator's areas, since the protection of the national forest was paramount.

In 2017, Navigator invested 3.4 million euros in forest fire protection actions; 1.43 million euros for prevention (1.15
million euros for cleaning and vegetation control of 11,000 hectares and 270 thousand euros for preserving 3,400 km
of road infrastructure).

TIMBER SUPPLY

The successful orchestration of purchase criteria, means, logistics, and the distance between the source and the
industrial units, ensures the sound management of wood supply to Navigator. However, the raw material provided by
the properties owned by the Company covers only 15% of the total needs of its mills. The rest of the timber is purchased
from suppliers in the Iberian Peninsula (77%) and in Latin America (13%).

Navigator was a front-runner in raising the awareness of forest producers to the importance of certifying the forests.
Since 2007, the purchase price of certified wood was raised. Such effort put in by the Group was a positive development
in the purchase of certified wood, which resulted in a significant increase in its share in total supply of wood, which
grew from 9% in 2015 to 27% in 2017.

It should be highlighted that all wood that is not certified is guaranteed to be of registered designation of origin and
fulfills equivalent quality requirements. On the other hand, the relationship with the aforementioned economic
operators is founded on a Suppliers Code of Ethics and Conduct, drawn up to guide business partners in these relations.

3.6.3 ENERGY

Besides being a pioneer, Navigator is still number one in power generation from biomass in the Country, representing
approximately 52% of total production from this renewable source. The Company intends to reinforce this position,
which is why it is looking into investing in new assets.

The year 2017 was very positive in terms of power generation from biomass, which increased 6% over 2016. Globally,
power sales of the Company grew 3.6%, totalling 5.7 million euros. Thanks to the use of renewable energy sources,
namely biomass and solar, it is estimated that Navigator is currently responsible for avoiding annual emissions of around
460 thousand tons of CO2.

On the other hand, the Company continues to consolidate the implementation of the Cooperative Program for Energy
Efficiency under its strategic intervention axes.

Furthermore, 2017 was the first full year of operation for the solar power plant About The Future, operating on a self-
consumption basis, having achieved annual savings of the electricity bill of approximately 270 thousand euros. The set-
up of another photovoltaic system operating on a self-consumption basis was initiated in 2017 at the Herdade de
Espirra, which is expected to reduce annual purchase of electrical power by approximately 100 thousand euros.

An initiative is underway to optimize the productive process across Navigator, seeking to create compatibility between
reducing specific power consumption of paper pulp and reducing the consumption of chemicals and raw materials. In
this regard, Navigator undertook clearly to reduce specific power consumption of paper and paper pulp by around 15%
until 2025.

3.6.4 ENVIRONMENT

Navigator is proud of its advanced ongoing environmental improvement program, extending beyond legal requirements
and anticipating the mandatory deadlines. One example is the Company's high level of investment in the industrial units
to reduce significantly the smell, namely at the Cacia mill (7 million euros) and in Figueira da Foz (6 million euros). Studies
conducted by external entities conclude that this project has helped to reduce the perception of the typical bad small
of these production units.

In addition, Navigator has invested in new particle filters in the biomass boilers, making it possible to cut emissions well
below the statutory limits. Several measures were also taken to reduce water usage in three dimensions: reducing
during the process, reliability during supply, and reusing waste water.

Through this project underway at the Setubal industrial unit, water withdrawal needs will decrease around 20% in the
next five years.

3.6.5 INNOVATION, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Since the end of 2017, Navigator has an area devoted solely to the analysis of the capacity to implement the ideas that
come out of the internal innovation cycles and research projects conducted by RAIZ. Following closely the scientific
inputs of the Institute for Forest Development, Navigator proposes to implement the most feasible measures, according
to technical and financial feasibility criteria, not to forget future impact on the community.

In 2017, the 3rd cycle of the Operational Program for Innovation, aimed at developing innovative projects, had
approximately 60 employees participating. The projects submitted came from different areas, and addressed very
different topics such as Forest Management, Paper Pulp, Energy, Paper, Tissue Paper, Maintenance, Product,
Procurement, Logistics and Supply Chain, and Organisation.

It is worth noting the high value proposal of the submissions that have fostered the innovation culture of The Navigator
Company.

The research and development function is embedded in RAIZ, which focuses on developing know how in the industry
of manufacturing paper and paper pulp from eucalyptus trees, carrying out consistent work that fosters the links
between the industry and the academic community.

In 2017, the expectations of researchers and technicians were crowned by the reinforcement of this institution's ties
with universities and other national and international scientific and technological entities, through the approval of a
series of network research initiatives.

In 2017, revenue grew by 6.2% in relation to the previous year, standing at 499.5 million euros. In geographical terms,
growth in Portugal and Brazil offset the drop in other places.

EBITDA stood at 88.8 million euros, which translated into an increase of around 3.6 million euros in relation to the same
period in 2016, particularly due to strong growth in Portugal and Lebanon.

Net financial results amounted to -40.3 million euros, compared to -37.2 million euros in 2016. The deterioration was
due to unfavourable exchange rate differences of around 8.9 million euros. This effect aside, the financial results would
be -31.4 million euros, an improvement of 5.8 million euros when compared to the figure in the previous year.

Net results hinted at an improvement of 17 million euros compared to 2016.

Net debt year-end 2017 dropped around 8.9 million euros to 414.0 million euros.

4.4 BUSINESS REVIEW
4.4.1 PORTUGAL

4.4.1.1 MARKET BACKGROUND

In Portugal, the Bank of Portugal reviewed upwards (Economic Bulletin - December 2017) the economic growth
projection for 2017 to 2.6% against 1.8% previously foreseen in the beginning of the year. This development is supported
by rising exports, the domestic demand pick up and rise in investment.

The figures were impacted mostly by the public works sector with the housing sector showing very positive dynamics
according to Secil's estimates. The building and public works production index maintained positive variations
throughout the year, with the engineering works segment being more dynamic than the building segment.

In this environment, the Secil Group presented the following overall indicators for its operations in Portugal in 2016 and
2017.

The Cement and Clinker unit in Portugal recorded revenue of 159.8 million euros in 2017, representing growth of 8.1%.
In the domestic market, revenue grew 14.9% with volumes sold having risen 11.1%. Good weather conditions, as well
as more local government and private projects (tourism and residential) and rehabilitation works, especially in Lisbon
and Oporto, contributed to this progress.

In the foreign market, surplus supply in Europe, the Mediterranean and West Africa continued to drive competition,
with a negative effect on volumes and sale prices. Export revenue dropped around 1.9% with volumes sold for export
amounting to 1,115 thousand tons, down by approximately 7.5% year-on-year. This was mostly the result of
approximately 44% less cement sales, largely due to the reduction in sales to Algeria, a main destination of cement
exports in previous years. Clinker exports were up by 48%, which largely exceeded previous year's numbers.

The Cement unit EBITDA of 26.3 million euros was below 29.3 million euros recorded in the previous year. It should be
noted that EBITDA in 2016 was influenced by the extraordinary current asset gains of around 3.3 million euros.

In addition to the rise in the volumes sold in the domestic market and of clinker in the foreign market, electric power
improved slightly in spite of the increase in thermal energy, which was offset by the optimisation of the fuel mix, due to
the reinforced use of alternative fuels. These elements helped in part to make up for the decrease in cement sales in
the market, and subsequent negative effect on EBITDA.

4.4.2.1 MARKET BACKGROUND

In Lebanon, according to the latest figures published by the IMF, the economy is expected to have grown by 1.5% in
2017 (World Economic Outlook, IMF October 2017), below potential.

Cement consumption in 2017 stood at 5.18 million tons, 1.6% less year-on-year. In spite of a better political environment
in the country (the election of a president and the appointment of a new Prime Minister at the end of 2016), the year
was marked by political instability, with the Prime Minister resigning by the end of 2017.

The following table presents overall indicators for the Secil Group’s business operations in Lebanon in 2017 and 2016:

Revenue on combined operations in Lebanon decreased 2.4% compared to the previous year, amounting to 92.2 million
euros. This amount was negatively affected by the depreciation of the USD against the Euro by about 1.9 million euros.

In 2017, total EBITDA from operations in Lebanon stood at 35.9 million euros, up by 9.8% in relation to the previous
year. EBITDA in 2017 was impacted positively by approximately 2 million euros, received on insurance payment due to
the breakdown of one of the mills in 2016.

Cement sales totalled 1,150 thousand tons, up by 3.1% year-on-year. Sales prices in local currency stood at similar levels
to that in 2016, slightly down by 0.6% due to changes in the sales mix. Revenue decreased against that of 2016 to 86.0
million euros, in spite of the increase in volumes sold, due to the currency depreciation.

The Cement unit recorded EBITDA of 35.5 million euros, 8.7% over the figure recorded in 2016. The growth was driven
by increasing cement and clinker production and lower production costs. In 2016 clinker production was less due to the
planned maintenance stop of one of the kilns to install the filter sleeves. This investment fostered the optimized use of
raw materials and a drop in production costs. Less electric power consumption also provided a positive input. However,
solid fuel price increased and in the fourth quarter of 2017 a new tax on cement production was enacted.

This unit's EBITDA amounted to 412 thousand euros, which compares favourably with 65 thousand euros in 2016.

4.4.3 TUNISIA

4.4.3.1 MARKET BACKGROUND

In Tunisia, the political and social environments improved somewhat in 2017, which had a positive impact on the
economy. However, Tunisia's economy is still facing significant challenges, including high foreign and tax deficits, rising
debt and insufficient growth for reducing unemployment. Some social unrest and pressure from union claims continue.
According to the latest figures published by the IMF, the Tunisian economy is expected to grow by 2.3% in 2017, above
the 1% figure recorded in 2016 (World Economic Outlook, IMF October 2017).

It is estimated that the domestic cement market decreased 0.5% year-on-year. The fall in the market produced a bigger
impact in the southern region (the natural market of Secil's operations). The cement market continued to be
characterized by intense competition and high pressure on sales prices, which dropped. Additionally, there was a
shortage of steel for building in the country, which influenced cement sales, particularly in the 4th quarter and with a

REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

The cement export market decreased significantly, due to constraints on the Libyan border and in obtaining foreign
currency in the Libyan financial market. In the Algerian market, the government did not issue any import licenses.

The following table presents overall indicators for the Secil Group’s business operations in Tunisia in 2017 and 2016:

Total 42.6 56.0 -23.9% 8.9 10.5 -15.0%

Revenue for combined operations in Tunisia in 2017 stood at approximately 42.6 million euros, down by 23.9% on a
year-on-year basis.

EBITDA from business operations in Tunisia in 2017 stood at 8.9 million euros, down by 15.0% in comparison with the
previous year. The decrease resulted from the reduction in revenue of the domestic market and change in the export
product mix.

It should be noted that the variable unitary production costs of cement were lower than in the same period in the
previous year, brought down mostly by less electrical power costs, due to the drop in prices (in June 2016 prices dropped
significantly) and the decrease in specific consumption.

Staff costs were also down, as a result of the decrease in the number of employees. These improvements more than
offset the effects of increase in thermal power costs, resulting from the rise in fuel prices.

The revenue of the Cement and Clinker business unit dropped approximately 23.8%, and stood at 37.0 million euros,
due to the decrease in revenue in the domestic market and an increase in the external market, albeit not enough to
offset the drop. The aforementioned constraints in the case of exports and greater competition in the domestic market

determined the pace of cement sales of this unit.

To counteract the drop in cement exports (-47%), clinker exports in 2017 totalled around 206 thousand tons, impacting
positively total export sales. Sales price in the domestic market was lower than that in 2016 by approximately 1%. In the
export market, prices remained below 2016 levels due to competition, the fact that there were no exports to Algeria
(where price is higher) and the rise in clinker sales (at a lower price).

REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS

Clinker production was higher than in 2016 (955 thousand tons in 2017 vs. 858 thousand tons in 2016), due to the take-
off of clinker export sales in 2017. Cement production was lower than 2016 levels (889 thousand tons in 2017 vs. 1.018
thousand tons in 2016), due to the decrease in cement sales in the internal and external markets.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

Investment amounted to 2.1 million euros, the equivalent to 2016, mainly intended for investments in replacement.

4.4.4 BRAZIL

4.4.4.1 MARKET BACKGROUND

The IMF is forecasting a 1.1% growth in the Brazilian economy for 2017 (World Economic Outlook Update, IMF January
2018). Brazilian economy is still being affected by the lack of trust of economic agents, rising unemployment and scarce
public investment. Despite the drop in inflation rates and interest rates, private investment has not increased, as a result

of the unstable political situation.

In this context, the construction industry was naturally affected, with an impact on cement consumption that dropped
6.3% vis-a-vis 2016. However, the South/South-East region where Secil operates decreased 4.7%, less than the overall

market decrease.

In 2017, the revenue of Cement and Clinker totalled 69.9 million euros (more than 7.7%), compared to the previous
year. The growth was positively impacted by the rise in the volumes sold and the appreciation, on average, of the
Brazilian real against the euro, the sales price of cement and concrete having dropped year-on-year. In the last quarter
a slight rise in prices began.

EBITDA stood at 4.9 million euros, compared to 6.2 million euros in 2016. The increase in volumes sold and the
improvement of variable production costs (less energy consumption and lower electric power prices) were not enough
to mitigate the effect of the drop in sales price.

The volumes of ready-mix concrete sold, market which was also impacted negatively by the context, increased by
around 26%, with sales of 269 thousand m? of ready-mix, a performance positively influenced by the start-up of two
new Ready-mix concrete plants and the development of a commercial excellence project.

EBITDA was minus 0.5 million euros, comparing unfavourably with the amount in the previous year (-0.3 million euros).

Namely, the increase in the amounts sold was insufficient to make up for the rise in fixed costs associated with the
structural expansion, resulting from the opening up of the distribution centres and of the new concrete plants.

REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS

Clinker and cement production in Brazil were above that of 2016, arising from more cement sales and better clinker
operations. The Adriandpolis mill continued on the path of good industrial performance. Thermal and electric power
consumption was below the previous year's levels, which helped to keep variable cost levels lower.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

Investments in Brazil totalled 8 million euros in 2017, as a result of some strategic projects, such as the beginning of the
assembly of the new crusher and conveyor belt in Adriandpolis, the beginning of the alternative fuel project or the
investments linked to the opening up of two new concrete mills.

4.4.5 ANGOLA

4.4.5.1 MARKET BACKGROUND

The IMF expects the Angolan economy to have grown in 2017 by 1.5% (World Economic Outlook, IMF October 2017).
The negative effects of oil price developments since 2014 are still felt. Due to the stagnant economy, a fragile banking
sector and shortage of foreign currency, many companies were forced to shut down, which brought unemployment
figures up, with the arising social problems. To address the situation, the Government of Angola implemented tough
cost reduction measures and launched several programs for the diversification of the economy which, however, did not
produce immediate results, as there were not many foreign investors betting on the Angolan economy and the
Government is faced with financial issues. These growth expectations did not materialize and in 2017 the Angolan
cement market decreased by 34% year-on-year, standing at 2.57 million tons.

The following table presents overall indicators for the Secil Group’s business operations in Angola in 2016 and 2017:

REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

The amount of cement sold decreased in comparison to accumulated sales in 2016, amounting to 151 thousand tons
of cement sold, 2.5% less than in the last year. Revenue stood at 20.7 million euros in total, above that in 2016, asa
result of the appropriate and strict management of the sales price, which grew around 11%, in euros, compared to the
previous year.

EBITDA reached 3.0 million euros, above the figure recorded in 2017. In addition to rising prices, the effort to reduce
costs was maintained with a view to counteract the contracting market.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

Investments totalled 469 thousand euros in 2017, mainly as a result of investments in the area of security.

4.5 RESOURCES AND SUPPORTING FUNCTIONS

4.5.1 SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENT

Despite the Sustainability Report that will be disclosed, note that Secil incorporates sustainability into all management levels, thus
aligning its industrial activity with environmental protection and social responsibility.

Secil is part of the Cement Sustainable Initiative under the WBCSD, it chairs the Cembureau European Cement
Association, and is a member of several organisations in Portugal, such as ATIC — Cement Industry Technical Association,
GRACE — Action and Reflection Group for Entrepreneurial Citizenship and BCSD Portugal.

In this context, it has actively contributed to drawing up and reviewing reflection and position papers on sustainability,
and participated in sector working groups.

The company is aware of the need to reduce carbon intensity of its activity and to integrate the circular economy in its
business model, and has made investments in equipment and innovative technologies, and in research and
development in innovative solutions in applying cement.

Efficient management of natural resources, better energy efficiency, replacing fossil fuels with alternative fuels,
integrating secondary raw materials in the production process, and fostering biodiversity in the environmental recovery
of the quarries in which it operates are some of the best practices the Company has been pursuing consistently for
several years on the path towards sustainability.

Taking social responsibility for its actions is a priority in the communities surrounding its plant units. This is implemented
through community development and institutional relations programs, which have received due recognition from the
stakeholders for their soundness and perseverance.

Training and development of human capital and the adoption of a supply chain favouring local suppliers are other sides
to sustainability, pursued in a systematic manner.

5.3. OVERVIEW OF THE ENVIRONMENT BUSINESS AREA

The ETSA group recorded revenue of approximately 29.0 million euros in 2017, up by 8.5% in 2016.

This development was essentially cumulatively caused by (i) an increase in the average sales price of class 3 fats by
around 16.7% and the same class meal by approximately 17.8% in comparison with 2016, a decrease in volumes sold by
about 12.2% year-on-year, (ii) volumes sold of class 2 were very significant, representing a 148.2% growth, at a price
around 5.8% higher, (iii) 13.5% more consolidated service provision, essentially resulting from the increased billing of
animal carcass collection, but also from higher volumes billed by the subsidiary ABAPOR (which increased around 12.9%
in comparison with the previous year).

EBITDA for the ETSA Group totalled approximately 7.7 million euros in 2017, representing an increase of about 12.0%
in comparison with the previous year, explained essentially by: (i) increase in revenue, as described above, and (ii)
control of main costs, namely supplies and external services.

The EBITDA margin stood at 26.6%, up by around 0.8 p.p. on the margin in 2016.

In 2017, depreciations, amortisations and impairment losses of ETSA totalled 2.8 million euros, in line with the figure in
the previous year.

Financial results improved by around 19.1% on the previous year, amounting to minus 0.5 million euros as a result of
the drop in total average debt and better contractual conditions.

Consequently, the net income for the year 2017 grew by 9.8% to 3.2 million euros.

5.4 RESOURCES AND SUPPORTING FUNCTIONS

5.4.1 SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENT

Despite the Sustainability Report that will be disclosed, it should be noted that ETSA concluded cooperation protocols with
QUERCUS — Nature Conservation National Association and ZERO — Association for Sustainable Earth System in the
context of environmental protection and sustainability.

5.4.2 INNOVATION, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

In 2015, ETSA's focus on Research and Development materialized, and several projects for setting Innovation goals were
initiated. Several internal research lines were created and developed jointly and in partnership with institutions of
higher education connected to chemical, biotechnology and Agro-food technology.

Some of the numerous research lines developed and fostered by the Group's sustainability and profitability applied to
Incentive Systems in view of obtaining co-financing for these work lines. The group obtained approval for a joint-venture
under the program Portugal 2020 (ITS, SEBOL and UCP-Porto Catholic University), aimed at developing new products
and new business opportunities for improving the group's competitiveness.

In 2017, the Mobilizador project was also approved under Portugal 2020, involving ITS, SEBOL and a large number of
private and public entities of the Agro-food industry in Portugal, in view of creating networks and interactions between
several of the industry's national players. Finally, and also in this financial year, aligned with a recycling operator in the
Environmental area belonging to ETSA, a project was submitted and approved in the context of the Circular Economy
Phase | of the Environmental Fund, sponsored by the Environmental Ministry. This very competitive application is now
eligible for the Phase II, thus reinforcing the nature of circular industry of ETSA.

These R&D lines seek to reinforce the sustainability nature of ETSA, optimising the use of natural resources and
minimising the negative impact on the environment.

6 SEMAPA GROUP HUMAN RESOURCES

Semapa believes that a human resource policy founded on professional and personal development and growth of
employees is the basis for the development and growth of the Group as well. Therefore, human resources are a priority,
and several talent management programs are underway in the Group, either in the holding Semapa and its subsidiaries,
or across the board, with a strong focus on career training and management.

The Group's serious concern about the size and streamlining of its human resources largely depends on the suitability
of qualifications, specialisation of some functions and the development of necessary skills. The sustainability report that
will be disclosed for the first time this year will address this matter in depth.

The Workforce of the Semapa Group stabilised slightly above 6 thousand employees, standing at 6,047 at the end of
December 2017, as shown in the following table:

The increase in the Paper and Paper Pulp area derives mainly from the increase in staff numbers in the new businesses
(Pellets and Tissue).

8.2 FINANCIAL RESULTS

In 2017 financial results amounted to a negative figure of 63.9 million euros, improving 14.1% in relation to the figure
recorded in the previous year. This favourable variation of 10.4 million euros is explained essentially by the net
combined effect of the following factors:

e Positive effect arising from a decrease in interest rates, debt repayment and debt renegotiation in more
favourable conditions;

e The positive results of Navigator's forex hedges, reflecting namely the depreciation of the USD, partially
offsetting the negative effect in sales;

e Exchange rate depreciation in the Cement business (excluding this effect, the financial results in this business
would have been better than the previous year's levels).

8.3. RISK MANAGEMENT

Details of risk management may be consulted in the relevant section of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements (Semapa Group).

8.4 LISTED SHARE PRICE

The financial year of 2017 proved to be fairly positive for global capital markets, with US stock exchanges reaching new
record highs. At the European level, the main stock exchanges recorded gains, with DAX reaching record highs. Q4 ended
up penalizing the equity markets in Spain and Italy, following political events, namely the Catalonia issue and the political
crisis in Italy.

The main stock exchange in Portugal, PSI 20, was up by 15.2%, after the loss of 11.9% in the previous year, one of the
indexes that grew the most among European markets (e.g. Eurostoxx 50 recorded 5.6% gains). The reversal of the trend
resulted from the positive developments of the Portuguese economy, improvement in the credit conditions of the
European Central Bank and improvement of the rating of the Portuguese Republic to investment grade.

In this context, the value of Semapa shares in the period increased 32.8%, above the PSI 20 (+15.2%) and EFB (13.4%)
average. Semapa's stock price reached a maximum of 18.21 euros on 18 December and a minimum of 12.76 euros on
17 January.

improvement of 8.0% compared to the same period in the previous year. Net income per outstanding share stood at
1.538 euros/share.

This development is explained essentially by the combined effect of the following factors:
e Anincrease in total EBITDA of approximately 11.6 million euros;
e  Adecrease in depreciation, impairment losses and provisions of 16.1 million euros;
e  Animprovement of net financial results by about 10.4 million euros, in relation to the previous year;

e Anincrease in corporate income tax by approximately 33.9 million euros, arising namely from the reduction of
tax benefits applicable to the payable corporate income tax of the Navigator Group and from the fact that in
2016 tax provisions (gains) were reversed.

10 OUTLOOK

Global economic growth outlook remains positive, sustained on Q4 indicators of 2017 highlighting the positive economic
moment. Additionally, household and corporate confidence levels reached historically high levels, namely in developed
economies, hinting at ongoing positive dynamics in 2018.

However, several geopolitical, commercial, political and strategic risk factors may still compromise economic growth
developments, namely possible rise in tension in North Korea, trade tensions between China and the USA, or changes
to NAFTA, developments in the Brexit negotiations, adverse developments in the Catalan affair, and elections in Italy.

Short term interest rates in the euro area will possibly remain at negative levels in 2018, the ECB and the main Central
Banks playing a fundamental part, especially in managing the slowdown of monetary stimulus.

PULP AND PAPER

Year 2017 was extremely positive for the pulp sector: prices were increased several times and ended the year at an all-
time high near 1,000 USD/ton. Most price forecasts for 2018 are also positive, without any substantial increase in the
supply of pulp expected in the next two years. However, fears as to whether prices are sustainable at this level exist and
may lead to a degree of adjustment over 2018.

In tissue, January saw phase two of the current round of price increases, which started in October. The continued high
level of pulp prices, combined with new capacity coming on to the market, will undoubtedly keep tissue producers under
strong pressure again, especially in the case of non-integrated manufacturers.

The development projects initiated in 2017, the construction of a new tissue mill in Cacia (with reel production and
converting capacity) and improvements to pulp production efficiency and environmental performance at the Figueira
da Foz mill, will continue into 2018, involving total investment of approximately 205 million euros (120 million euros in
Cacia and 85 million euros in Figueira da Foz), of which 70 million euros has already been spent. The additional pulp
capacity in Figueira da Foz is due to start up in April, and the new tissue line in Cacia is planned to produce its first reels
in August.

In the UWF paper sector, Navigator took the lead in increasing prices on several occasions in 2017, and announced a
new price rise for the North American market in early 2018. Order books remain at comfortable levels, and a positive
year can be expected for the sector, whilst evolution of the exchange rate is likely to remain the main cause for concern.

As mentioned, Navigator has decided to proceed with its capital projects in Mozambique at a more moderate pace and
to implement its plans in stages. Portucel Mocgambique is however ready to proceed with its forestry plans, as soon as
circumstances in the country permit — most of which are under discussion with the Mozambique authorities.

CEMENT AND OTHER BUILDING MATERIALS

GDP growth outlook for Portugal in 2018 is slightly inferior to 2017 estimates; according to the latest projections of the
Bank of Portugal, the economy is expected to grow by 2.3%. Macroeconomic indicators point to growth, although
investment levels, limited by deficit management, are a growth-restricting factor. Developments in the external
environment may play a decisive part in growth; most international bodies looking at the global economy now share a
more positive outlook. With indicators of engineering activity evolving favourably, the public works industry is expected
to grow. Government budget deficit is still limiting, albeit less so, and a pick-up in public investment backed by
community funds should follow. The housing segment is expected to grow, as a consequence of the increase in the
number of new licensed dwellings in the second half of 2017, and the positive prospects in urban renewal. The dynamics
of the rentals market and growth in the tourism industry are the drivers of this growth trend.

REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

In Lebanon, cement demand in 2018 should decrease slightly against 2017, in spite of improvement in the political
situation. New taxes implemented in the last quarter of 2017 are expected to have a negative impact on the profit of
cement companies in the country. The parliamentary elections in 2018 will also influence the political context.

Possible developments in the Syrian conflict and the situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon will probably produce a
macroeconomic effect and on the market, which cannot be anticipated at this stage. A challenging competitive
environment is expected to continue with slightly lower net prices.

A 3% growth in 2018 of the economy is the forecast for Tunisia (World Economic Outlook, IMF October 2017).
Competition should continue to be intense and increased pressure on sales prices is expected (in the domestic and
foreign markets), due to oversupply in the country. Overall rise in taxes and rates are to be expected, just as the current
political/economic situation in Tunisia should continue with greater security issues.

Brazil is expected to grow by 1.9% in 2018 (World Economic Outlook, IMF January 2018), above expected growth of
1.1% in 2017, which hints at the improvement of conditions. However, economic activity should continue to face
challenges, particularly activities in the building sector, due to the difficulty of materialising investments. The political
crisis is still a strong constraint on growth, which shall depend greatly on developments in the political framework. Sales
price developments will have an impact on the performance of operations, which is why efforts will continue to be put
into improving production costs and controlling fixed costs.

The Angolan economic outlook is positive for 2018. The IMF is forecasting 1.6% economic growth in 2018 (World
Economic Outlook, IMF October 2017). The programs to diversify the economy of the Angolan Government, the upward
trend of oil prices on the international markets in the second half of 2017, average annual population growth by 2.7%
and the general elections in 2017, which brought about a new President of the Republic and, consequently, a new
Government, are expected to bring substantial changes to governance in the country, with outlooks of economic
recovery for 2018 that will drive growth in cement consumption.

ENVIRONMENT

Considering the current macroeconomic, financial and sector context, current conditions are envisaged to remain
unchanged in the medium term in the sector operated by the ETSA group, insofar as consumption of foodstuffs is
maintained. However, the competition between operators in arranging raw material, which is scanty, will remain
intense, because of the pronounced overcapacity of industrial processing.

The ETSA group’s prime objectives in the short term include: (i) concentrating on the horizontal expansion of its
production and destination markets (exports accounted for around 53.1% of total sales in 2017), (ii) identifying fresh
opportunities for vertical growth, channelling its investments to improving operational efficiency, extracting maximum
value from the channels operated and retaining the loyalty of the main conventional and alternative collection centres,
(iii) the gradual and progressive recovery of balanced sales margins in the market, and (iv) focus on sustained innovation
and research and development addressed at ensuring new profit thresholds for the business.

12 PROPOSED ALLOCATION OF PROFITS

Considering that the Company needs to maintain a financial structure compatible with the sustained growth of the
Group it manages in the various Business Areas in which it operates,

Considering that the Company’s independence from the financial sector involves preserving consolidated levels of short,
medium and long-term debt which allow it to maintain sound solvency indicators, and

Considering that the Company's Remuneration Committee and the Executive Board have taken a stance on the amounts
which, in their view, may be paid to the members of the Board of Directors and the Company's Employees, respectively,
for the financial year 2017, the total approximate amount of which is known,

It is hereby proposed:
1. That the Net Profits for the individual period, determined under the IFRS rules, in the amount of EUR

124,093,467.26 (one hundred twenty-four million, ninety-three thousand, four hundred and sixty-seven euros and

twenty-six cents) be allocated as follows:

Dividends on shares in circulation EUR 41,310,039.55*
(0,512 cents per share)
Free reserves EUR 78,383,427.71
Share of the Employees and Directors in the profits of the financial year up to EUR 4,400,000.00

* excluding own shares held; 586,329 own shares were considered; on the payment date, if this amount is changed, the total

dividends payable may be adjusted, while the amount payable per share will remain unchanged.

2. That the individual distribution of the share in profits be made by the Executive Board in that which relates to the
Employees and by the Remuneration Committee in that which relates to the Directors and, since this amount was
already reflected in the financial statements, it shall be transferred to item Free Reserves.

3. That the amount regarding the participation of Employees and Directors in the annual profits which in accordance
with applicable accounting standards has been specialized in personnel costs, is reversed by the respective amount
of credit in Free Reserves.
