3.1 2013 MARKET TRENDS

3.1.1 TELEVISION

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
2013 MARKET TRENDS

Television remained a very attractive medium for the French population
in 2013, both on a daily basis and for major events. The development
of new technologies is opening up more possibilities, with a continuous
improvement in TV set image quality, an ever-increasing choice of
channels, and additional services alongside live viewing via the web and
companion screens.

HIGH PENETRATION OF TV SETS ENCOURAGES
CONSUMPTION”

Almost every French home now has a TV set: 98% have at least one,
and of these, 50% have more than one.

After setting an all-time sales record of 8.7 million units in 2011 with
the completion of the transition to all-digital, TV set sales have gradually
return to their earlier level, with 5.7 million sales for 2013.

Television technology in French households continues to become more
modern. Now 84% have a 16/9 set (up 3 points in one year), and 83% a
high-definition (HD) set (also up 3 points).

While the attractiveness of video equipment continues to rise, growth in

audio equipment is relatively flat. As for home cinema systems, 15% of
households now have one.

MULTI-CHANNEL ACCESS NOW THE NORM“

In fourth-quarter 2013, apart from the 1% of households receiving
television exclusively via analogue cable, all French households received
at least the 19 freeview DTT channels. 67% of them also received all
or some of the six HD channels launched in 2012, and 62% a broader
channel offer via satellite, cable, ADSL or pay TV. This huge shift in the
French broadcasting landscape has happened relatively quickly: at end-
2006, only 39% of homes with TV sets could access multi-channel
offerings.

DTT is the most popular way of receiving television, with 58% of homes
having a DTT connection (/.e. an external or internal decoder combined
with a Yagi aerial). Since the end of the switch to all-digital, this TV
reception mode has declined slightly (by 2 points in one year), while
high-definition reception (HD DTT) has stabilised (45% of households).

ADSL/fibre optic ranks second, with 41% of homes connected. It is the

fastest-growing reception mode (up 4 points in one year).

Satellite, the longest-standing reception mode, has stabilised at 25% of
households, with pay subscriptions accounting for 13% and free satellite
(DTT and Fransat) for 12%.

Cable continues to decline (8%, down 1 point in one year), both for pay
offers (6%) and free offers (3%).

TV CONSUMPTION METHODS: CHANGING,
BUT SLOWLY”

New ways to watch TV are developing, but are still only marginal.

Only 1 minute a day was spent watching live TV outside the home
(‘anywhere” viewing), equivalent to just 0.4% of live viewing, as
measured by the Médiamat. This figure excludes viewing at relatives’ or
friends’, which is already included in Médiamat statistics.

For non-TV set devices (computers, smartphones or touchscreen tablets
- “any device” viewing) the average live viewing time was 2 minutes a
day, or 0.8% of live TV consumption.

In terms of non-live, or “anytime”, viewing, a distinction is made between
watching catch-up TV on sets, computers, smartphones and tablets,
which amounts to 3 minutes a day, or 1.1% of live TV consumption, and
viewing recordings made at home (timeshift viewing), which has been
included in Médiamat statistics since January 3, 2011. Timeshift viewing
boosted audience ratings by 2.0% (an extra 4 minutes and 42 seconds
per day for French people aged 15+). Over 44% of timeshift viewing is
VOSDAL (View on Same Day as Live).

In 2013, the vast majority of DTT channels were included in the
Médiamat national viewing statistics, the only exceptions being LCP,
BFM TV, i<Télé, France © and the six new freeview channels launched
on December 12, 2012.

A CHANGING TELEVISION LANDSCAPE IN
FRANCE

The television landscape in France has changed considerably over
the past several years. The number of freeview channels went from
six in 2005 to 19 at end-2011 with the first wave of the DTT rollout. In
December 2012, six more HD channels were added to the freeview line-
up, bringing the total number in France to 25.

This growth has meant several things. First, new freeview television
operators emerged in France (AB Group, Nextradio, NRJ group, Bolloré,
Canal+, and Lagardére). The resulting market fragmentation has shrunk
the audiences of the incumbent channels. The incumbent groups have
sought to maintain their positions by acquiring more channels, either
by bidding for spectrum offered by the French broadcasting regulatory
authority (CSA) or buying channels from new entrants.

FUTURE TV-SET TRENDS: IS UHD NEXT®?

CONNECTED TV SETS

Some 1.6 million connectable TV sets or smart TV were sold in France in
2013, a decline of 6% (compared with a 15% decrease for all TV sets).
Connectable TV sets accounted for 27% of units sold in 2013 (up from
25% in 2012), they are expected to continue gaining in popularity and to
account for almost all TV set sales in five years.

Smart TV user interfaces (pointer, voice and gesture control) have
improved and now deliver a very different experience from tablets and
PCs. More and better quality applications are available in stores. The
channels’ HbbTV (Hybrid broadcast broadband TV) service has improved,
too (the user interface is now commonly displayed at the bottom of the
screen), and TF1 has launched an experimental service, MYTF1VOD, on

(1), Médiamétrie - Médiamat - 2013.

the brands of TV partners. So far, however, Smart TV has not radically
altered viewing habits and is not boosting manufacturers’ sales.

3D AND UHD (ULTRA HD)

While 3D seems to have permanently passed from the scene, the first
consumer models of 4K TV or UHD have debuted with relative success.
Offered only with large screens (a minimum of 55") and a high-end finish,
these TV sets sell for between €5,000 and €9,000. According to the
manufacturers, (Samsung, SONY, and LG), several tens of thousands of
units have been bought. GFK announced sales of 10,000 units in 2013.

The resolution of these screens termed “4K” (referring to the 4,000 pixels
per line) or UHD (Ultra High Definition) is double that of HD, i.e. there
are four times as many pixels. However, it is still too early to predict
the future of 4K or UHD. Several obstacles lie in their path. First, the
manufacturing and broadcasting capabilities are not ready.

INTERNET USE IN FRANCE

Some 44 million people in France connect to the Internet from their
computer (up 1 million in one year), or 72% of the population (up
2 points). However, those people are spending less time on the web
(down 2 hours and 24 minutes). This trend is explained in large part by
the increased use of mobile devices to connect to the Internet.

The TF1 group ranks 19" among all groups on the Internet in France
(computer access) thanks to the performance of sites associated with
the TF1 channel (MYTF1 and MYTF1News), other media holdings
(Eurosport and Metronews), and pure player sites such as WAT and
Plurielles.fr.

MYTF1 is the number one TV channel on the Internet, with over 9 million

Smartphones and tablets are now common devices with very high

in the fourth quarter of 2013), and nearly 8 million households now have

2013).

There are 24 million mobile internet users in France (up 2.5 million in one
year), with a penetration rate of 47% (up 4.5 points). They go online an
average of 183 times a month, up 56% from a year ago.

In numbers of mobile internet visitors, TF1 is the leading television
channel, Eurosport is second in the sports segment, WAT fourth in
video, and Metronews seventh among news outlets.

The TF1 group is introducing innovative online products in step with
these new usages.

In 2013, TF1 continued to develop its brands in the multi-screen
universe: in February, the TF1 group's new site became MYTF1News,
with the launch in July of an enhanced version for Android and iOS
tablets. One new feature is video multitasking, which allows users to
continue reading an article while watching a video.

With the launch of 4G, MYTF1 and MYTF1News for smartphones and
tablets began offering new, innovative functionalities in October 2013
such as downloading of some programmes for replay, the possibility of
returning to the start of the programme at any time during the broadcast,
and visual display quality never before achieved on mobile devices.

Connect functions on television channel applications also made their
debut in 2013. Observing that TV viewers frequently use a second
screen (tablet, smartphone, the web) while watching television, the
channels are offering synchronised services related to the TV program to
enhance the viewing experience. These include:

additional information (infographics, statistics, exclusive videos, etc.
related to newscasts or soccer matches);

real-time game modules (Le 5° coach on The Voice, le Défi live on the
French soccer team's matches, etc.);

instant replays, to share an excerpt of the programme being shown
on TF1

With the launch of Connect in February 2013, TF1 remains the leader in
this functionality and lays claim to the term that will be used by the rest
of the industry.

And since more and more viewers are communicating with one another
over social networks while they watch the same show, TF1 has joined
with Twitter to become the first channel to launch the Amplify programme
in France, first for Dancing with the Stars, then for Masterchef, the
French team’s soccer matches, and the NRJ Music Awards. TF1 is the
only French television channel to offer advertisers this innovation, with
allows them to benefit from the social networking echo effect on Twitter.

THE MAINSTAYS OF THE TF1 GROUP: REPLAY, LIVE
AND VIDEO PRO

On average, 80% of TF1's programming is available on MYTF1 in live
and replay versions as well as through exclusive content.

Live and non-live viewing of the programmes of the TF1 group's
channels is increasingly done on multiple screens, with usages differing
between screens.

While web viewing has fallen below 2012 levels, strong growth is
observed for mobile screens, tablets and IPTV.

Usages vary from one screen to another, too: on tablets and mobile
phones, the bonuses and excerpts account for a larger sharing of the
viewing, while on IPTV, replays are the most popular content

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

2013 MARKET TRENDS

Live viewing is also benefiting from multiple technical and product
innovations:

= direct control (on the 4G version of the app), with the possibility of
going back to the beginning of the program being shown;

= live online commentary: during Danse avec les stars in
September 2013, live, behind-the-scenes reporting was done during
the broadcast.

Innovation has played a key role in the new version of WAT.tv, the TF1
group's premium online video site, which was launched in May. The
product has been rethought and adapted to satisfy web users’ new
expectations (e.g. a new video player and a wall for the most-watched
videos on Facebook and Twitter).

SOCIAL MEDIA TRENDS: SOCIAL TV

How social networks are used has changed greatly over the past two
years, with mobile phones and tablets becoming the main devices that
their members rely on to communicate with one another.

Three of the leading social networks indicate that about 50% of their
total traffic comes from mobile devices: Twitter (65%), Facebook (48%)
and YouTube (41%).

The social networks are continuing to grow, and new ones are starting up.

Facebook says it has over 1.1 billion users, while Google+ has now
reached 1 billion and Twitter more than 500 million. The majority of

3.1.3 ADVERTISING

Facebook users are active, while for Google+, the figure is 35% and for
Twitter, 40%.

In 2013, new networks with enormous appeal for young people —
Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat - joined the ranks of the social
media. The main loser in this trend was Facebook, which saw young
members shift their interest to these new networks.

In France, the number of Facebook users declined on the web to 29.2
million (down 2.5 million, or 8%, in one year) and on mobile devices
to 14.7 million (down 1 million), while Instagram added 1 million mobile
users (up 71%), while fixed internet users remained stable at 2 million.

The TF1 group now has 20 million fans and about 40 fan pages, mainly
on Facebook and Twitter.

By actively capitalising on social media in conjunction with the channel's
leading programmes (The Voice, Danse avec les Stars, NRJ Music
Awards), TF1 has become the channel generating the most exchanges
on the social networks.

For example, almost 35 million tweets were posted concerning TF1's
programmes.

By launching Connect with The Voice and then being the first channel to
use the Amplify programme on Twitter, which it introduced with Danse
avec les stars, TF1 demonstrated in 2013 its capacity to carry out a
compelling and effective second-screen strategy.

The slowdown in advertising observed in 2012 continued in 2013.
Net plurimedia advertising revenues fell by 5.7%" in first-half 2013
(excluding Search). The advertising market was expected to shrink by a
lesser amount in the second half, though the data are not yet available.

Gross spend increased by 2.3%" year on year.

The following data are gross values. As such, they should be treated
with caution owing to the strong pressure on prices in 2013, and hence
the differing scope for price negotiations in the various media.

TRENDS IN PLURIMEDIA ADVERTISING SPEND
IN 2013@@

Plurimedia advertising spend rose overall in 2013, after declining in
2012, but individual results varied. There was a sharp upturn during the
year, with a modest gain of 0.5% in the first half, followed by 4.0% in the
second half.

The uneven performance was observed across all media.

Television (excluding sponsorship) was more than ever the top medium,
accounting for 35.1% of gross plurimedia spending (up 1.4 points).
Gross revenues for television rose 6.6% to €9.6 billion in 2013.

Within the TV category, the positive trend for incumbent channels
continued, with a 4.3% increase in gross spend to €5.6 billion. The other
freeview DTT channels also turned in strong performances once again,

with spend up 15.3% to €3.2 billion, due in part to the contribution from
the six new HD DTT channels, which alone generated €290 million in
gross revenues. Excluding the HD DTT channels, advertising spend was
up 4.9%. CabSat spend was down 7.1% to €794 million.

Gross advertising spend in television (excluding sponsorship) increased
by 2.5% in the first half, while the net spend was down 6.8%, compared
with the first half of 2012.

In terms of gross spend, print media remained the second-ranked

DIGITAL MEDIA IN 2013

According to the SRI group of advertising sales agencies, revenues
in the Internet display advertising market (excluding search) totalled
€753 million, an increase of 2%.

Growth in display advertising was driven primarily by three trends: a
dynamic video segment, the development of real-time bidding (RTB),
and accelerating growth in the mobile display advertising market.

Video (instream) continued to rise sharply (up 32%), generating revenues
of €136 million in 2013. The strong momentum comes from high
demand from advertisers as well as from growth in premium offers and
video related to TV programming (catch-up TV, second screen, IPTV,
etc.). TF1 Publicité has a strong position in this segment with MYTF1,
which covers practically all TF1 programming between 6pm and
midnight (excluding cinema) and is available on four digital screens (web,
mobile, tablets and connected TVs).

Real-time bidding (RTB) exchanges generated €117 million in net
revenues in 2013, a strong gain of 125% over 2012. They account for
a substantial 16% of display revenues, and this trend is expected to
accelerate. The International Data Conseil (IDC) is forecasting that RTB,
which is commonly used in the ad exchanges, will grow annually by 51%
worldwide and 39% in Europe by 2017").

France is one of the leading countries in this segment, owing notably
to the development of premium ad exchanges like LaPlaceMedia. By
joining with Amaury Médias, FigaroMedias and Lagardére to create
LaPlaceMedia, TF1 Publicité gains a strategic position in this segment,
where it auctions advertising space for “editorialised" content on
websites. Nearly 30,000 advertisers bought online space through this
exchange in 2013.

Mobile display advertising (including tablets) was very dynamic in 2013,
with net revenues of €79 million (up 55%). In this segment, TF1 Publicité
consolidated its leadership in the “second-screen” market by making
it a strategic priority. Innovative offerings such as MYTF1 Connect and
the partnership with Shazam were developed to further exploit screen
interaction and synchronisation

TF1 Publicité is also positioned in the fast-growing social TV segment,
notably through its partnership with Twitter (the Connect & Amplify offer).
TF1 group programmes demonstrated their viral potential in 2013 by
accounting for 26 of the 30 most referenced shows on social networks
(Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)".

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
2013 MARKET TRENDS

TF1 Publicité is taking advantage of the specific features of digital
screens (fixed web, mobile, tablet, connected TV) by launching special
operations in this still-growing segment.

The number of households with a connected TV set increased by 35%
in one year“. Connected TV is thus another strategic opportunity for
TF1 Publicité, which is already offering innovative advertising and
editorial services such as a “brand corner” and a channel dedicated to
an advertiser.

OUTLOOK FOR 2014

The economic context in 2014 should be fairly similar to 2013, with
no signs of consumption recovery, households’ purchasing power
still under pressure due to high unemployment and increased fiscal
pressure ©),

In France, a recovery in advertising spend seems quite uncertain, as
reflected in agencies forecasts, a majority of which assume the market
will remain stable; ZenithOptimedia anticipates a 0.3% plurimedia
investment growth for whereas OMG is building on a 0.6% growth
forecast®” for 2014.

Against a backdrop of weak market and increased competition, TF1
Publicité keeps on implementing new ways of commercialisation for
its offers, so as to answer market needs as fully as possible (Modulo,
Events screens) and gain fluidity.

In an increasingly fragmented market, TF1 Publicité’s strength relies on
a relevant and efficient offer, rolled out on 3 complementary segments
of the market:

= mass media (TF1);
= intermediate segment (HD1, N23, Les Indés Radios...);
= targeted segment (Metronews, thematic channels, digital offer).

Efficient coordination of these contact segments allows TF1 Publicité to
respond effectively to all of our customers’ communication needs.

Innovation is also a major asset, and remains a priority, with a two-fold
strategy: TV-Digital convergence (interaction and synchronization of
screens) and connected-TVs.

3.1.4 REGULATION

COMPENSATORY CHANNELS

Article 103 of Act 2007-309 of March 5, 2007, amending the Act of 30
September 30, 1986, and establishing that on the complete shut-down
of analogue television, an additional channel, called a “compensatory
channel”, would be awarded to the three analogue private channels (TF1,
M6, Canal+) was repealed by the Act of November 15, 2013, regarding
public television independence. This Act was passed after the European
Commission, in response to a complaint, addressed a formal demand
to France on November 24, 2010, in which it judged the attribution of
these compensatory channels incompatible with the European directives
known as the “Telecoms Package" because it would represent a special
and exclusive right, which in prohibited and would penalise competitors.
In a substantiated opinion dated September 29, 2011, it called on
France to take all necessary measures to put an end to this breach.

Taking account of this opinion, the French government repealed
Article 103 of the Act of March 5, 2007, as well as Article 104, which
stipulated the three analogue private channels could not claim any other
kind of compensation.

IMPACT OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF PUBLIC
BROADCASTING ACT OF NOVEMBER 15, 2013

The Independence of Public Broadcasting Act was enacted on
November 15, 2013, and published in the Journal officiel on November
16, 2013. This law amends several provisions of the Act of September
30, 1986, concerning the freedom of communication. The changes
include the following:

REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2013 Kaa]

= the Conseil Supérieur de |'Audiovisuel (CSA) will henceforth have
seven instead of nine members. Only the Chairman will continue to
be appointed by the President of the Republic, three members will be
selected by the speaker of the Assemblée national and three by the
speaker of the Sénat. The six members designated by the speakers
will be appointed upon approval by the standing committee in charge
of cultural affairs at a three-fifths majority of votes cast;

® anew sanctions procedure modelled on the Competition Authority's
strictly separates the legal and investigative functions from the
imposition of sanctions. The CSA continues to have the authority to
impose sanctions, but only after referral of a matter by the rapporteur,
who is independent from the CSA and the broadcasting sector.
(The rapporteur is appointed by the Vice President of the Council of
State, on the CSA's recommendation, from among the members of
administrative jurisdictions for a four-year term, renewable once);

= the CSA may decide not launch a call for bids if a prior impact study
or public consultation reveals that economic conditions in the market
are unsuitable. The CSA may postpone call for a two-year period,
renewable once;

® advertising will continue to be shown during the day on France
Télévisions after 2015;

® compensatory channels cannot be granted;

= the CSA may give approval for a pay DTT channel to become freeview
and vice versa. Approval requires a reasoned decision, a public
impact study, and a hearing of all parties who request it. The stability
of the advertising market must also be taken into consideration;

® the channels may have an equity interest in the works they co-finance
with regards to independent production. A decree will specify how they
may do this, i.e. the amount of financing by a channel that authorises
an equity interest in the coproduction and the secondary rights the
channel may hold (mandate, the term of the rights, secondary rights).

3.2 2013 ACTIVITY AND RESULTS

In accordance with IFRS 5, the 2013 financial statements present separately the contributions from Eurosport International, which is currently
being sold. To ensure comparability with previous publications and given that the sale of Eurosport International did not take place during the
year ended December 31, 2013, the full-year results are presented on the basis of financial data before the adjustments required by IFRS 5.
Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements provides a reconciliation between the financial data used in this document and the financial

results published by the Group.

CHANGES IN PRESENTATION

TF1 changed the way it presents its segment information during 2013 (cf. notes 1, 2 and 6 to the financial statements).

(1) Includes a gain of €27.1m relating to a reimbursement of CNC tax.

(2) Includes non-recurring costs of €47.7m relating to phase 1! of the optimisation plan and to the TF1 Vidéo jab protection plan.

REVENUE

For the year ended December 31, 2013, consolidated revenue amounted
to €2,470.3 milion, a year-on-year fall of €150.3 million (down 5.7%).

Advertising revenue was €1,679.0 million, 5.4% less than in 2012.
It comprised:

= €1,487.6 million for the Group's 4 free-to-air channels (down 5.0%).
This docline reflecting very tough economic conditions and price
erosion due to intense competitive pressure. However, the Group
successfully adapted its commercial policy during the course of the
year. That revenue for the 4 free-to-air channels — which fell by 8.8%
in the first half of 2013 (13.0% in the first quarter and 4.9% in the
second quarter) — fell by only 1.1% in the second half (stable in the
third quarter of 2013 and down 1.8% in the fourth quarter);

€83.7 million for other Broadcasting and Content segment media, flat
year-on-year. Dynamic performances from internet advertising (e-TF1)
and from TF1 Publicité’s third-party airtime sales (especially the radio
business) offset lower advertising revenue at Metro France;

= €107.7 million for Pay-TV segment media, 14.4% lower than in
2012. This drop was due partly to lower advertising revenue at the
French pay-TV channels in tough economic conditions, and partly
to a reduction in advertising revenue at the Eurosport group due to
different seasonal advertising patterns in 2013 versus 2012 (when the
Olympic Games and the UEFA Euro 2012 football tournament were
shown).

Non-advertising revenue for the year to December 31, 2013 was €791.3
million, a drop of 6.4% versus 2012 (down €53.8 million). The Consumer
Products Division saw revenue fall by €35.2 million. Higher revenue
at TF1 Entreprises only partially offset the slippage at TF1 Vidéo (high
comparative base owing to the success of /ntouchables in 2012) and
Home Shopping. Eurosport’s non-advertising revenue was 3.7% lower,
while Content revenue was down 1.1%.

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

2013 ACTIVITY AND RESULTS

COST OF PROGRAMMES AND OTHER
OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES

Phase Il of the optimisation plan, launched in 2012, generated €41
million of recurring savings in 2013, including €22 million on the cost of
TF1 programmes, €10 million on overheads and €9 million in productivity
gains. These savings, added to the €15 million generated in 2012, add
up to €56 million of recurring savings achieved since the optimisation
plan began, out of the €85 million TF1 is committed to achieve by the
end of 2014. The Group has already committed to cutting overheads
by a further €17 million, and needs to generate savings of €29 million
in 2014, of which €10 million will come from the cost of programmes at
TF1 and €19 million from productivity savings.

The cost of programmes for the TF1 group's 4 free-to-air channels
reached €946.7 million for the year to December 31, 2013, against
€1,004.4 million a year earlier, a fall of €57.7 million year-on-year.
Excluding major sporting events, the cost of programmes fell by €33.5
million, reflecting the fact that TF1 screened 9 matches from the UEFA
Euro 2012 football tournament in 2012 at a cost of €24.2 million. These
figures show that the TF1 channel made substantial savings, since the
cost of programmes for 2013 includes HD1 (launched at the end of
December 2012) and the strengthening of TMC and NT1 programme
schedules in response to increased competition in Digital Terrestrial
Television.

Other expenses and depreciation, amortisation, provisions and
impairment were €57.6 million lower in 2013 than in 2012. Bear
in mind that in 2012 the figure included a gain of €27.1 million from
reimbursement of CNC (National Centre for Cinematography) taxes
booked in the first quarter. The 2013 figure includes the gain from the
sale of Place des Tendances, and a provision relating to the sale of some
of the 2014 FIFA World Cup rights, booked in the fourth quarter of 2013.

CURRENT OPERATING PROFIT

The TF1 group made a current operating profit of €223.1 million in 2013,
versus €258.1 million for the previous year. Although this represents a
€35.0 million year-on-year drop, bear in mind that revenue fell by €150.3
million over the same period. The 2013 figure includes the gain from the
sale of Place des Tendances, and a provision relating to the sale of some
of the 2014 FIFA World Cup rights, booked in the fourth quarter of 2013.

REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2013 Kaa]

OPERATING PROFIT

The Group posted a €223.1 million operating profit for the year to
December 31, 2013, up €12.7 million on 2012. Operating margin was
9.0%, versus 8.0% a year earlier.

Bear in mind that 2012 operating profit included non-recurring costs of
€47.7 million related to phase II of the optimisation plan and to the TF1
Vidéo job protection plan.

NET PROFIT

Cost of net debt for the year to December 31, 2013 was positive at €0.4
million.

Other financial income and expenses showed net income of €0.8 million
in 2013, versus €5.8 million a year earlier. Bear in mind that the 2012
second-quarter figure included the fair value remeasurement of the call
option over TF1’s 33.5% equity interest in Groupe AB granted to Claude
Berda in June 2010.

Income tax expense amounted to €73.4 million in 2013, versus €70.5
million in 2012. Associates contributed net income of €0.8 million, up
€7.2 million, thanks to a better performance from Groupe AB and the Q1
2013 sale of WBTY, which was loss-making in 2012.

Net profit attributable to non-controlling interests was €14.7 million in
the year to December 31, 2013, versus €3.3 million a year earlier. This
rise was due mainly to the Discovery Communications group having
acquired an equity interest in Eurosport and a number of French pay-TV
channels in December 2012.

Overall, the Group's net profit for the year to December 31, 2013
reached €137.0 million, versus €136.0 million a year earlier.


--- Page 16 ---

FINANCIAL POSITION

Shareholders’ equity attributable to the Group as of December 31,
2013 was €1,711.4 million, out of a balance sheet total of €3,529.8
million. The net cash surplus at end December 2013 was €255.5 million,
compared with €236.3 million at December 31, 2012.

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
2013 ACTIVITY AND RESULTS

The Group had confirmed bilateral credit facilities totalling €1,025.0
million with various banks. None of these facilities was drawn down at
the end of the period. The facilities are renewed regularly as they expire,
so that the Group has sufficient liquidity at all times.

Consequently, the financial position of the TF1 group remains very
healthy.

Net advertising revenue for the Group's 4 free-to-air channels fell by
5.0% in 2013, but advertising revenue from other media was stable,
thanks to growth in digital advertising and in TF1 Publicité third-party
advertising airtime sales, offsetting lower revenue for Metro France.

After two quarters of declining advertising revenue for the Group's 4
free-to-air channels (down 13.0% and 4.9% respectively), the picture
stabilised at zero growth in the third quarter and only a 1.8% fall in the
fourth quarter.

Gross advertising market share in 2013 was 35.1%, down 1.4 points on
2012 for TF1 channel.

Advertising revenue from other media fell by 4.6% in the final quarter of
2013, after rising by 2.4% in the first nine months of the year, hit by lower
revenue at Metro France.

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

2013 ACTIVITY AND RESULTS

Audiences

In this more competitive marketplace, the TF1 group is for the first time
the leading French broadcaster. The Group is striving successfully to
provide its 4 channels with the most complementary and relevant range
of programmes possible.

The combined audience share of the Group's 4 free-to-air channels to
end December 2013 was 28.9% among individuals aged 4 and over,
a rise of 0.5 of a point (or 1.8%) on 2012. For “women aged under
50 purchasing decision-makers”, the combined audience share was
32.6%, versus 32.2% to end December 2012 (a 1.2% increase).

TF1

The TF1 channel was the only major French channel to increase its
audience share to end 2013, reaching 22.8% for individuals aged 4
and over (versus 22.7% to end 2012). Among “women aged under
50 purchasing decision-makers”, the audience share was 25.2%, 0.3
of a point lower than at end 2012 (a fall of 1.2%). TF1 has therefore
increased its lead over its nearest private sector rival to 12.2 points for
individuals aged 4 and over (versus 11.5 points to the end of 2012) and
9.0 points for “women aged under 50 purchasing decision-makers"
(versus 8.5 points). This performance reflects the channel's ability to
deliver innovative, unmissable programmes.

These figures confirm TF1's unique position and status as the must-
see channel. It recorded 99 of the 100 best audiences of 2013 (all
programmes combined). It also achieved the best audience (all channels
combined) with 13.6 million viewers for Le spectacle des Enfoirés (on
March 15"), again beating its previous record. TF1 achieved audiences
of 8 million on 51 occasions; it was the only channel to attract more than
9 million viewers (which it did on 14 occasions), and 3 programmes were
watched by over 10 million viewers.

The average prime time audience for the TF1 channel in 2013 was
6.0 million; it was the most-watched channel in 9 out 10 evenings.

Innovation is enabling the channel to refresh its strong brands and
increase the number of regular viewers. The editorial policy adopted by
TF1, based on a popular, must-see offer, has propelled the channel into
no. 1 position in all the programme genres it offers, helping it achieve:

= 99 of the 100 best audiences for TV news

TF1's Journaux Télévisés are still Europe's most popular news
programmes. Efforts to modernise the Group's news output are bearing
fruit, with the audience shares for televised news programmes up sharply
to end 2013: audience share for the lunchtime news bulletin rose by 1.2
points to 44.0% for individuals aged 4 and over, while the evening news
bulletin reached 27.4% of this audience (up 0.7 of a point year-on-year).
TF1’s news bulletins increased their lead over their closest rival, which
widened to 3.7 million viewers for the lunchtime bulletin (up 0.3 million
year-on-year) and to 1.8 million for the evening bulletin (up 0.3 million).

= 94 of the 100 best audiences for American series

Two series were successfully launched this year: Unforgettable and
Person of interest, which drew up to 9.0 million and 7.5 million viewers
respectively. Series like Mentalist and Criminal Minds (French title: Esprit

REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2013 Kaa]

Criminels) also posted very good audience figures (peaking at 9.4 million
and 8.5 million respectively).

= 87 of the 100 best audiences for French drama

Profilage enjoyed a record season, with a peak of over 8.2 million
viewers. The audience for drama grew by 500,000 from one season to
the next. Nos Chers Voisins attracted up to 8.2 million viewers and Pep's
up to 8.7 million

= 78 of the 100 best audiences for entertainment and magazines
Les Enfoirés attracted 13.6 million viewers on March 15th.

The Voice was also a great success, bringing in up to 9.6 million viewers
in its second season. Finally, Canteloup attracted up to 9.9 million
viewers, a record for the programme.

= 57 of the 100 best audiences for movies

TF1 recorded the best audience for a movie since November 2010 with
Rien a déclarer (10.0 million). Avatar had 9.7 million viewers.

Finally, the France v. Ukraine football match broadcast on November 19,
2013 achieved a TV audience of 13.6 million, the highest figure for a
qualifier since 1993.

TMC

In an intensely competitive environment, TMC had audience share of
3.4% among individuals aged 4 and over in 2013 (down 0.2 of a point
year-on-year), rising to 3.7% among “women aged under 50 purchasing
decision-makers” (versus 4.0% a year earlier).

TMC once again ranked as the no. 5 channel nationwide in 2013 and
is still no. 1 among DTT channels with individuals aged 4 and over. In
the evening slot, it is the nation’s fourth most popular channel among
“women aged under 50 purchasing decision-makers”.

The channel enjoyed an average prime time audience of 800,000, stable
year-on-year. Prime-time movies proved to be particularly popular, and
TMC was the best performing of the DTT channels, averaging 1.0 million
viewers. TMC had the highest audience figure for a DTT channel in 2013
for Despicable Me (French title: Moi, moche et méchant) (2.3 million
viewers). TMC also broadcast the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, with
1.9 million viewers watching the Spain/Italy semi-final on June 27".

TMC also achieved the highest audience figure for a DTT magazine
programme with 90’ enquétes (1.4 million viewers), and in the autumn
of 2013 launched the magazine programme Sans Aucun Doute, which
attracted up to 700,000 viewers in access prime time.

NT1

NT1 again posted strong year-on-year growth to end December 2013
among “women aged under 50 purchasing decision-makers", as
audience share reached 2.9% (up 7.4%). Among individuals aged 4 and
over, audience share was stable year-on-year at 2.1%. These figures
show that NT1 is proving resilient in the face of increased competitive
pressure. The channel had an average prime time audience of 500,000
(versus 600,000 a year earlier).


--- Page 20 ---

NT1 attracted particularly high ratings for the reality show Bachelor
(reaching 1.3 million viewers in prime time and 9% audience share
among “women aged under 50 purchasing decision-makers”). NT1 also
demonstrated the pulling power of its movie offer with 1.5 million viewers
for X-Men: The Last Stand (French title: X-men, I’affrontement final) and
of successful American series such as Vampire Diaries and The Walking
Dead.

HDt

Launched on December 12, 2012, HD1 is the TF1 group's fourth free-to-
air channel. Devoted to all forms of narrative, the channel was accessible
to over 67% of the French population as of December 31, 2013.

At end 2013, HD1 was market leader among the 6 new HD channels
launched in late 2012. In 2013, the channel achieved audience share
of 0.6% among individuals aged 4 and over, and 0.8% among “women
aged under 50 purchasing decision-makers”.

The channel had an average prime-time audience of 141,000 and
attracted the highest viewing of any of the 6 new HD DTT channels in
2013 with the movie Braquage 4 'Italienne (The Italian Job) peaking
at 494,000. HD1 also has the strongest brand recognition of these 6
channels".

Month after month, HD1 is building on the success of its launch, and
adding further audience share.

e-TFT

e-TF1, the TF1 group's digital subsidiary, continued to innovate during
2013 via the launch of MYTF1 Connect, a live second-screen extension
to MYTF1 and MYTF1News, and an ambitious new version of the
MYTF1News website.

Online video once again performed very well on MYTF1 fr and WAT.tv.
The TF1 group is the leading French media group in terms of time spent
on video, ranking alongside the multinational giants”), with over 9 million
unique visitors watching an average of around 1 hour 10 minutes of
videos per month.

The MYTF1 app is also going from strength to strength, with over 8.0
million downloads to end December 2013".

There was no let-up in the momentum of e-TF1 during 2013, with
revenue up 1.3% year-on-year at €102.6 million.

This good performance was driven not only by higher revenue from
online advertising, but also by a further rise in non-advertising revenue.

Topline growth coupled with ongoing cost control helped e-TF1 post
current operating profit of €21.1 million to end 2013 (compared with
€18.3 million a year earlier), taking current operating margin to 20.6%
(versus 18.1% a year earlier, a rise of 2.5 points).

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
2013 ACTIVITY AND RESULTS

The success of e-TF1, in terms of both consumption and profitability, is
a clear vindication of the TF1 group's digital strategy.

Other media
Metro France

The print media advertising market contracted by 1.1% versus 2012".
Daily freesheets saw gross revenue drop by 1.8%".

Metro France continued to transform its model: on May 29, 2013
it changed its name, launching an “all media” news offer under the
Metronews banner.

Metronews is the 2" most-read daily newspaper in France, with nearly
2.9 million readers. The strategy adopted at the start of 2012 is paying
off in terms of readership, with a significant increase of 2.2% since the
last survey, thanks to the geographical rollout and the reverse publishing
policy. The audience for the Metronews.fr site broke through the 3 million
unique visitor mark in November 2013, reaching 3,108,000, a rise of
94% year-on-year,

Given the contraction in the print media market and strong competition,
Metro France saw revenue and current operating profit fall in 2013.
TF1 Publicité (third-party advertising sales)

The third-party advertising airtime sales business continued to expand,
with new additions both in radio (M FM) and TV (BelN SPORT, Numéro
28).

CONTENT

Revenue for the Content business was down slightly by 1.1% at €70.7
million to end 2013, with good performances by TF1 Production and
TF1 Films Production outweighed by the fall-off in revenue at TF1 Droits
Audiovisuels. Current operating profit for 2013 was €8.8 million, versus
€5.2 million a year earlier.

Movie market”
Cinema footfall reached 192.8 million in 2013, down 5.3% year-on-year.
For the last four years footfall has been over 200 million.

The market share of French movies fell sharply to 33.3% in 2013, against
40.3% for 2012.

TF1 FILMS PRODUCTION

In 2013, TF1 Films Production co-produced 19 movies shown on
cinema screens, against 14 in 2012. Of these, 7 had exceeded the 1
million admissions mark by December 31 (against 8 in 2012).

TF1 DROITS AUDIOVISUELS

TF1 Droits Audiovisuels saw revenue fall to end 2013. 10 movies went on
general release during 2013, compared with 15 a year earlier. However,
TF1 Droits Audiovisuels did distribute the movie Les Profs, which was
the best performing French movie of 2013, with 4.0 million admissions.

Current operating profit increased, thanks to strong sales for the movie
catalogue and series.

TF1 PRODUCTION

TF1 Production posted a slight year-on-year rise in revenue in 2013.

TF1 Production produced Splash and a scripted reality show (Petits
secrets entre voisins) for TF1 channels and delivered the new Crossing
Lines series to TF1 in the third quarter of 2013. It was TF1 Production
that handled the production of the UEFA Euro 2012 football tournament.

Cost containment measures meant that current operating profit rose
proportionately more than revenue during the period.

Revenue for the Consumer Products Division fell by 14.6% to €205.1
million, and current operating profit was €7.3 million higher at €25.3
million. The division's results incorporate the effects of the sale of Place
des Tendances which was deconsolidated on November 5, 2013.

TF1 VIDEO”

The Video market again contracted sharply in 2013. The physical video
market declined by 16.7% by volume and 14.1% by value to €929.1
million. The main reasons for this were falls of 18.8% in revenues from
DVD sales to €724.2 million and of 8.5% from Blu-ray sales to €204.9
million. Blu-ray represented 22.1% of video sales revenue in 2013,
against 20.1% in 2012.

The VoD market also contracted in 2013.

In this very tough market, TF1 Vidéo posted revenue of €58.0 million,
compared with €84.1 million in 2012. This €26.1 million reduction was
largely due to the success of the movie Intouchables, which went on
general release in 2012 and had a massively big impact on that year's
results. New movies launched in 2013 did not have the same success
as the star performers of 2012 like Polisse, Foresty Party and La Vérité si
je mens 3. Bear in mind also the good performances from MYTF1VOD,
which managed to introduce an ambitious strategy in 2013 in a market
where there is heavy competition from illegal downloads. The number of
sessions sold in 2013 was up 21% by volume year-on-year.

Current operating profit for the Video business rose by €0.5 million to
€0.8 million. Bear in mind that although 2012 current operating profit
was boosted by the performance of /ntouchables, the effect was partially
offset by restructuring costs under the job protection plan.

HOME SHOPPING®

French consumers carried out more than 600 million transactions online
during 2013, worth €51.1 billion. Total sales were up 13.5% year-on-
year, while the number of transactions leapt by 17.5%.

The Home Shopping business generated revenue of €85.5 million in
2013, versus €99.3 million a year earlier, a fall of 13.9%.


--- Page 22 ---

In an economic environment characterised by sluggish consumer
spending, this fall was attributable mainly to reduced order volumes
for the flagship Téléshopping brand, a less favourable product mix,
and weaker revenue for the Infomercials activity. In addition, Place des
Tendances has not been included in the consolidation since November
5, 2013.

Current operating profit reached €14.2 million in 2013, versus €6.8
million in 2012. The 2013 figure includes a non-recurring gain on the sale
of Place des Tendances.

TF1 ENTREPRISES

TF1 Entreprises posted revenue of €61.6 million in 2013, up 8.3% on
the previous year.

The current operating profit of TF1 Entreprises was €10.3 million, down
slightly by €0.6 million on 2012.

All departments of the subsidiary performed well:

Games”

The games market has been stable in 2013 (-0,3%). TF1 Entreprises
continued to grow its games business. Boom boom Balloon won the
prize for the best new children’s game at the 2013 “Grand Prix du Jouet”
awards. TF1 Entreprises’ market share fell to 7.0%, from 7.4% in 2012.

2013 ACTIVITY AND RESULTS

Music?

After contracting for 12 years running, the music market grew by 2.3%.
to €603.2 million. Physical sales were 1.0% higher, while the digital
market increased by 0.5% to €125 million, representing 25.5% of
sales. Associated rights were up 8.9%. Against this background, TF1
Entreprises had a very fine year, driven both by its own productions
and co-productions (Thérése, Les Stentors, etc.), the success of
partnerships (Céline Dion, Johnny Hallyday, etc.), co-produced live
shows (Disney on Ice, Cirques phénix), and show production (Stars 80,
The Voice roadshow, etc.).

Licences

TF1 Entreprises continued to exploit its licence portfolio effectively
(Mille Bornes, Hello Kitty), including some spin-offs from TF1 channel
programming (The Voice, Masterchef).

Publishing

Since 2011, TF1 Entreprises has been developing successful collections
like the Tintin figurines (more than 2 million sold) and Barbapapa, and
has been expanding abroad with the Laure! and Hardy collection in
Germany, and DC Chess in New Zealand and Great Britain.

Finally, in 2013 TF1 Entreprises set up a structure to operate venues
in the entertainment hub being created in the Cité Musicale on the ile
Seguin near Paris, due to be inaugurated at end 2016.

EUROSPORT GROUP

Eurosport group revenue was down €22.2 million (or 4.7%) year-on-year
at €452.9 million.

Non-advertising revenue was 3.7% lower year-on-year, at €362.7 million,
due to difficulties in the Spanish market and in Scandinavia, partially
offset by the channel's success in Eastern and Central Europe and the
growth of Eurosport Asia-Pacific.

The strong sporting calendar of 2012 (UEFA Euro 2012 football
tournament and the London Olympics) proved a tough comparative.
As a result, Eurosport’s advertising revenue fell by 8.5% year-on-year in
2013 to €90.2 million (after a 15.6% rise in 2012).

Profitability at Eurosport is continuing to improve, with current operating
profit rising by €18.2 million year-on-year to €81.8 million. Operating
margin was 18.1% in 2013, up 4.7 points year-on-year.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, Eurosport revenue fell 3.4% to €110.4
million. Current operating profit rose by €10.0 million to €27.1 million
thanks to very good cost control, giving operating margin of 24.5%,
versus 15.0% in the fourth quarter of 2012.

2013 ACTIVITY AND RESULTS

Operating performance

At end 2013, the Eurosport channel was being received by 132.8 million
households in Europe, 1.0 million more than at end 2012. The number of
paying households was up 0.3%.

The HD rollout continued, extending to 32.2 million homes (up 32.5%).
Eurosport 2 is now received by 68.1 million households (up 8.8%) and
Eurosport 2 HD by 16.6 million households (up 59.6%). Eurosport Asia-
Pacific is available to 9.3 million households, against 7.6 million at end
2012. Eurosportnews is received by 2.4 million households.

In an increasingly fragmented market that remains fragmented, TV
audiences contracted slightly, by 0.8%, though this is to be seen in the
light of the rich sporting calendar in 2012, with the London Olympics in
the summer. However, the decline in audiences during 2013 was limited,
thanks to a strong winter sports season and the other stalwarts of Group
channels (Alpine skiing World Championships, Roland Garros, African
Cup of Nations, etc.).

Internet audiences also grew, placing Eurosport in the top flight of sport
programming networks"”,

With 14 local versions on its website, the Eurosport network
was attracting an average of 3.7 million unique visitors to end
December 2013"), up 12.2% year-on-year.

During 2013, the partnership launched at end 2012 with Discovery
Communications fed through into a number of operational and
organisational initiatives. In addition, TF1 and Discovery Communications
signed an agreement in January 2014 under which Discovery was to
become the majority shareholder of Eurosport International in the near
future.

THEME CHANNELS FRANCE®

At a time when the range of free-to-air channels in France is increasing,
pay-TV channels as a whole had a 10.8% audience share to end
December 2013, down 0.4 of a point year-on-year.

TF1 theme channel revenue for 2013 was €77.8 million, down 11.2%
year-on-year, reflecting a €9.7 million reduction in advertising revenue.

The division posted a current operating loss for 2013 of €2.3 million,
against a profit of 0.7 million in 2012. The improvement in the cost base,
particularly on LC! and the Découverte Division channels, has to some
extent offset the drop in revenue in 2013.

TV Breizh

TV Breizh confirmed its position as the leading general interest mini-
channel on cable and satellite, with audience share of 1.2% among
individuals aged 4 and over, rising to 1.4% among “women aged under
50 purchasing decision-makers”.

Since March 2013, the channel has been transmitted from the TF1 site
in Boulogne, rather than its historical base in Lorient.

In atough competitive and economic context, TV Breizh reported a fall in
both revenue and operating profit in 2013.

Histoire, Ushuaia, Stylia”

Since April 2013, the Découverte channels have also been transmitted
from the TF1 site in Boulogne-Billancourt rather than from their historical
base in Lorient.

Ushuaia TV is maintaining its editorial policy, with the emphasis on
adventure and discovery; this policy is paying off, with the channel
enjoying the highest brand recognition in the discovery/lifestyle segment.

Histoire is continuing to focus on its editorial policy and on building
awareness of its brand as the benchmark history channel on cable,
satellite and ADSL. The channel has moved up one place to 6" in the
brand recognition rankings for the discovery/lifestyle segment.

Finally, Stylia continues to base its editorial policy on women's lifestyle
issues.

The division's revenues are proving resilient in a challenging market,
and cutting the cost base has helped the division improve margins
substantially.

TF6 and Serieclub

Full-year revenue and current operating profit for these two channels —
owned 50/50 by TF1 and M6 — were down year-on-year.

TF6 continues to add new first-run series and new entertainment
shows. The channel's audience share is 0.6% among individuals aged
4 and over, rising to 1.3% among “women aged under 50 purchasing
decision-makers”.

Serieclub has been pulling in excellent audiences thanks to ambitious
scheduling of first-run series, and is one of the fastest-growing French
pay-TV channel among “women aged under 50 purchasing decision-
makers”. The channel has a 1.1% share of this audience (versus 0.8%
a year earlier). Among individuals aged 4 and over, the audience share
also increased (by 0.1 of a point, to 0.6%).

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

2013 ACTIVITY AND RESULTS

The “Holding company & other" segment, which includes the Group's
property and transmission entities, posted revenue of €8.9 million (up
7.2%) and current operating profit of €16.7 million (an increase of €1.0
million).

The bulk of this segment's revenue is generated internally. However, its
current operating profit includes all margin generated by entities in the
segment.

For the TF1 group 2013 was a highly satisfactory year in terms of
editorial performance and audience figures but more difficult in economic
terms. However, despite the deeply disturbed environment, the Group
managed to preserve its operating profitability.

2014 will be an atypical year, with a rich programme of major events
to be broadcast on the Group's channels. It will be a year of elections,
both municipal and European, and of World War commemorations,
with the centenary of the First World War and the 70" anniversary of the
Liberation of France in the Second World War. 2014 will also be the year
of the Football World Cup in Brazil, the rights to which, acquired in 2005
for €130 million, will weigh on the Group's profitability.

The TF1 group is likely to be operating in an economic environment
characterised by an absence of signs of recovery, continuing poor
visibility and a declining television advertising market. 2014 will mark the
completion of phase II of the optimisation plan, with a further €29 million
of recurring savings to be generated by the end of the year.

2014 will probably also see the sale of 31% of Eurosport International
to Discovery Communications, after the sale of an initial 20% in 2012.

2014 is therefore destined to be an important transitional year which will
lay the foundations for the TF1 group's future growth.

Aware of the challenges ahead, freed of constraints, keen to create and
seize new opportunities, and supported by a solid financial structure,
the TF1 group is mobilised to continue its transformation by shifting its
business, its model and its profitability up a gear, and making growth a
priority.

IDENTIFYING THE CHALLENGES

Knowing what is at stake and how much is at stake, we have identified
the challenges to be overcome:

= an uncertain economic environment and trading conditions that are
likely to remain lacklustre for some time to come;

= intense competition;
= regulations that continue to be restrictive;

= the arrival of new international players in September 2014.

NEWFOUND AGILITY

To meet these challenges, the Group has revitalised itself, thanks to the
work that has been done over recent years.

Since 2007, the contours of the Group have evolved considerably. At
the same time, the Group has improved its ability to anticipate and
strengthened its ability to act.

The TF1 group now has a multi-channel offering characterised by the
recent moves towards complementary scheduling and circulation of
rights, with a digital offering deployed across all platforms.

In audiovisual rights, the Group has gained flexibility with the ending of
volume deals with producers. The Group's strategy has also evolved in
the area of sports rights, which have been abandoned or renegotiated
on a new economic basis, such as the French national football team
rights.

Innovation is key in all aspects of the business — channels, customer
service and digital.

All the changes that have been ongoing for several years - the
rationalisation of structures and operations, and the two phases of the
optimisation plan (€211 million of savings generated between 2008 and
2013, €29 million more to be generated in 2014) — are important for the
years to come because they are making the TF1 group more responsive
and better able to meet new challenges.

GENUINE STRENGTHS

The readiness to take up new challenges is backed by rigorous
management, a tighter organisation, rationalised operations and
financial solidity.

Alone or with the help of first-rate partners, the TF1 group is now in
a position to make long-term investments in new, complementary and
original businesses, either through organic growth or via acquisitions.

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

2013 ACTIVITY AND RESULTS

MANY OPPORTUNITIES

More than ever, the Group now needs to move up a gear and be ready
to seize all organic and external opportunities that arise.

First of all, the Group will be working to strengthen the identity of each
of its channels, being careful to maximise their complementarity and
optimise synergies between them, particularly in terms of audiovisual
rights exploitation, while complying with undertakings made to the
relevant authorities.

In order to secure content for the various channels, the Group will be
pursuing its investment policy, alone or in partnership, or via in-house
productions, while maintaining tight cost control

In 2015, under the terms of the undertakings made to the competition
authorities, the TF1 group will have to rethink its commercial offering.

The Group will continue to develop ever closer relations with all its
audiences. The arrival of new technologies is opening up new prospects.
for intensifying links with individual consumers on all available platforms.

In addition, the Group is paying particular attention to external
development opportunities via in-depth analysis of certain markets,
exploring the progress of new technologies (in the field of advertising for
example), and anticipating new trends.

CLEAR PRIORITIES

The priority of the TF1 group is to create value for its shareholders.

The probable sale in 2014 of 31% of Eurosport International to Discovery
Communications will strengthen the liquidity of the TF1 group, which will
be careful to maintain its solid financial structure.

The Group will also use its cash to support two other ambitions:
growth, which may be achieved organically — if necessary bolstered by
acquisitions — and providing a return to shareholders.

Prudence and determination will continue to be the watchwords for
action in 2014, confirming the stance adopted by the Group in recent
years.

3.2.3 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

Aware of its responsibilities as a leading media group, TF1 incorporates
corporate social responsibility into its strategic planning.

On the environment, the Group takes care that its productions, products
and innovations build sustainable development into their design and use.

In industrial relations, the Group ensures that it offers a high quality
working environment and tackles discrimination. The awarding and re-
awarding of the Diversity Label attest to the Group's continuing efforts
in this area.

In terms of social impact, key issues are the quality of the news
produced and broadcast on the Group's channels and websites, and
making sure that all programmes comply with the undertakings made
to the authorities.

The Group's corporate responsibility policy is also based on applying
ethical and responsible principles vis-a-vis all stakeholders.

2014 will also see further developments around the economic
contribution of the TF1 group and consideration of its role in society.

Finally, the Group will continue to play a federating role in the profession
through its management of the Media CSR Forum, which produces
sector indicators for media companies and disseminates good industry
practice.

REAFFIRMED AIMS

The TF1 group will continue to strengthen its dual role as France's
leading news and entertainment group.

The strategic choices it has made have paid off: the Group has now
been transformed and has provided itself with the resources to realise
its aims.

Rigorous day-to-day management is proving to be the best guarantee
of future growth, which will be achieved by seizing or creating new
opportunities to consolidate multimedia offerings and develop multi-
channel offerings.

Further to the agreements signed on January 21, 2014, Discovery Communications is shortly to acquire an additional 31% equity interest in Eurosport
SAS (see § 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 117 of the present registration document and annual financial report).
