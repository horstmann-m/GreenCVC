Business overview
History and strategy of TOTAL

1. History and strategy of TOTAL

1.1. History and development

TOTAL S.A., a French société anonyme (limited company)
incorporated on March 28, 1924, together with its subsidiaries
and affiliates, is the fifth largest publicly-traded integrated
international oil and gas company in the world“).

With operations in more than 130 countries, TOTAL has activities
in every sector of the oil industry: including in the upstream (oil and
gas exploration, development and production, liquefied natural gas)
and downstream (refining, petrochemicals, specialty chemicals,

the trading and shipping of crude oil and petroleum products,
marketing). In addition, TOTAL operates in the power generation
and renewable energy sectors and has equity stakes in coal mines.

1.2. Strategy

TOTAL began its Upstream operations in the Middle East in 1924.
Since that time, the Company has grown and expanded its
operations worldwide. In early 1999, the Company acquired control
of PetroFina S.A. (hereafter referred to as “PetroFina” or “Fina”) and
in early 2000, the Company acquired control of Elf Aquitaine S.A.
(hereafter referred to as “Elf Aquitaine” or “Elf").

The Company's Corporate name is TOTAL S.A.

The Company's registered office is 2, place Jean Miller,
La Défense 6, 92400 Courbevoie, France.

The telephone number is +33 1 47 44 45 46 and the website
address is total.com.

TOTAL S.A. is registered in France at the Nanterre Trade Register
under the registration number 542 051 180.

TOTAL's activities lie at the heart of the two biggest challenges
facing the world now and in future: energy supply and
environmental protection. The Group's responsibility as

an energy producer is to provide optimum management

of these twin imperatives.

TOTAL's strategy, the implementation of which is based on a model
for sustainable growth combining the acceptability of operations
with a profitable investment program, aims at:

- expanding hydrocarbon exploration and production activities and
strengthening its worldwide position as one of the global leaders
in the natural gas and LNG markets;

(1) Based on market capitalization (in dollars) as of December 31, 2013.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

progressively expanding energy solutions and developing new
energies to complement oil and gas;

adapting its refining and petrochemical base to market changes,
focusing on a small number of large, competitive platforms and
maximizing the advantages of integration;

developing its petroleum product marketing business, in
particular in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, while maintaining
the competitiveness of its operations in mature areas; and

pursuing research and development to develop “clean” sources
of energy, contributing to the moderation of the demand for
energy, and participating in the effort against climate change.

Business overview
Upstream

2. Upstream segment

TOTAL's Upstream segment includes the activities of Exploration & Production and Gas & Power. The Group has exploration and production
activities in more than fifty countries and produces oil or gas in approximately thirty countries. Gas & Power conducts activities downstream
from production related to natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), as well as power generation and
trading, and other activities. Effective July 1, 2012, the Upstream segment no longer includes the activities of New Energies, which are
now reported with Marketing & Services. As a result, certain information has been restated according to the new organization.

2.1. Exploration & Production

Business overview
Upstream

2.1.1. Exploration and development

TOTAL's Upstream segment aims at continuing to combine
long-term growth and profitability at the level of the best
actors of the industry.

TOTAL evaluates exploration opportunities based on a variety of
geological, technical, political, economic (including taxes and
license terms), environmental and societal factors and on projected
cil and gas prices. Discoveries of new fields and extensions of
existing fields have brought an additional 2,260 Mboe to the
Upstream segment’s proved reserves during the 3-year period
ended December 31, 2013 (before deducting production and sales
of reserves in place and adding any acquisitions of reserves in
place during this period). The level of revisions during this 3-year
period is close to nil (-11 Mboe) since the positive revisions on

a large majority of the fields have been significantly impacted by
the effects of the increase of the reference oil price (from $79.02/b
in 2010 to $108.02/b in 2013 for Brent crude), the variations of the
U.S. onshore gas price (from $4.38/MBtu in 2010 to $4.21/MBtu in
2011, $2.85/MBtu in 2012 and $3.67/MBtu in 2013 for Henry Hub)
and by a perimeter change in four projects.

In 2013, the exploration investments of consolidated subsidiaries
amounted to €2,809 million (including exploration bonuses included
in the unproved property acquisition costs). Exploration investments.
were made primarily in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia,
Norway, Iraq, French Guiana, Angola, Kenya, Céte d'Ivoire and
Mauritania. In 2012, the exploration investments of consolidated
subsidiaries amounted to €2,634 million (including exploration
bonuses included in the unproved property acquisition costs).
The main exploration investments were made in Angola,

the United Kingdom, the United States, Norway, Iraq, Nigeria,
Brazil, Malaysia, the Republic of Congo and French Guiana.

In 2011, the exploration investments of consolidated subsidiaries
amounted to €1,629 million (including exploration bonuses
included in the unproved property acquisition costs) notably

in Norway, the United Kingdom, Angola, Brazil, Azerbaijan,
Indonesia, Brunei, Kenya, French Guiana and Nigeria.

The Group's consolidated Exploration & Production subsidiaries’
development investments amounted to €16 billion in 2013,
primarily in Norway, Angola, Australia, Nigeria, Canada, United
Kingdom, the Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Indonesia, Russia,
the United States and Kazakhstan. The Group’s consolidated
Exploration & Production subsidiaries’ development investments
amounted to €14 billion in 2012, primarily in Angola, Norway,
Canada, Australia, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, Gabon,
Kazakhstan, Indonesia, the Republic of the Congo, the United
States and Russia. The Group's consolidated Exploration & Production
subsidiaries’ development investments amounted to €10 billion in
2011, mostly in Angola, Nigeria, Norway, Kazakhstan, the United
Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Gabon, Indonesia, the Republic of the
Congo, the United States and Thailand.

2.1.2. Reserves

The definitions used for proved, proved developed and proved
undeveloped oil and gas reserves are in accordance with the United
States Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 4-10 of
Regulation S-X as amended by the SEC Modernization of Oil and
Gas Reporting release issued on December 31, 2008. Proved
reserves are estimated using geological and engineering data to
determine with reasonable certainty whether the crude oil or natural
gas in known reservoirs is recoverable under existing regulatory,
economic and operating conditions.

TOTAL's oil and gas reserves are consolidated annually,

taking into account, among other factors, levels of production,
field reassessments, additional reserves from discoveries and
acquisitions, disposal of reserves and other economic factors.
Unless otherwise indicated, any reference to TOTAL's proved
reserves, proved developed reserves, proved undeveloped reserves
and production reflects the Group's entire share of such reserves
or such production. TOTAL's worldwide proved reserves include
the proved reserves of its consolidated subsidiaries as well as its
proportionate share of the proved reserves of equity affiliates.

For further information concerning changes in TOTAL's proved
reserves for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011,
see “Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited)” in
Chapter 11.

The reserves estimation process involves making subjective
judgments. Consequently, estimates of reserves are not exact
measurements and are subject to revision under well-established
control procedures.

The reserves booking process requires, among other things:

— internal peer reviews of technical evaluations to ensure that the
SEC definitions and guidance are followed; and

- that management makes significant funding commitments
towards the development of the reserves prior to booking.

For further information regarding the preparation of reserves
estimates, see “Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited)”
in Chapter 11.

2.1.3. Proved reserves for years 2013,
2012 and 2011

In accordance with the amended Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X,
proved reserves at December 31, are calculated using a 12-month
average price determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of
the first-day-of-the-month price for each month of the relevant year
unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding
escalations based upon future conditions. The reference prices for
2013, 2012 and 2011 were, respectively, $108.02/b, $111.13/o
and $110.96/b for Brent crude.

As of December 31, 2013, TOTAL's combined proved reserves

of oil and gas were 11 526 Mboe (49% of which were proved
developed reserves). Liquids (crude oil, condensates natural gas
liquids and bitumen) represented approximately 47% of these
reserves and natural gas the remaining 53%. These reserves were
located in Europe (mainly in Norway and the United Kingdom),

in Africa (mainly in Angola, Gabon, Nigeria and the Republic

of the Congo), in the Americas (mainly in Canada, Argentina and

Emirates and Yemen), and in Asia (mainly in Australia, Kazakhstan
and Russia).

As of December 31, 2011, TOTAL's combined proved reserves

of oil and gas were 11,423 Mboe (53% of which were proved
developed reserves). Liquids (crude oil, condensates natural gas
liquids and bitumen) represented approximately 51% of these
reserves and natural gas the remaining 49%. These reserves were
located in Europe (mainly in Italy, Norway and the United Kingdom),
in Africa (mainly in Angola, Gabon, Libya, Nigeria and the Republic
of the Congo), in the Americas (mainly in Canada, the United
States, Argentina and Venezuela), in the Middle East (mainly in
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen), and in Asia (mainly in
Australia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Russia).

2.1.4. Sensitivity to oil and gas prices

Changes in the price used as a reference for the proved reserves
estimation result in non-proportionate inverse changes in proved
reserves associated with production sharing and risked service
contracts (which together represent approximately 25% of TOTAL’s
reserves as of December 31, 2013). Under such contracts, TOTAL
is entitled to a portion of the production, the sale of which is

meant to cover expenses incurred by the Group. As oil prices
increase, fewer barrels are necessary to cover the same amount

of expenses. Moreover, the number of barrels retrievable under
these contracts may vary according to criteria such as cumulative
production, the rate of return on investment or the income-cumulative
expenses ratio. This decrease is partly offset by an extension

of the duration over which fields can be produced economically.
However, the increase in reserves due to extended field life resulting
from higher prices is generally less than the decrease in reserves
under production sharing or risked service contracts due to such
higher prices. As a result, higher prices lead to a decrease in
TOTALS reserves.

Furthermore, changes in the price used as a reference for the
proved reserves estimation have an impact on the volume of
royalties in Canada and thus TOTAL's share of proved reserves.

Lastly, for any type of contract, a decrease of the reference price
of petroleum products may involve a significant reduction
of proved reserves.

2.1.5. Production

For the full year 2013, average daily oil and gas production was
2,299 kboe/d compared to 2,300 kboe/d in 2012 and 2,346 kboe/d
in 2011. Liquids accounted for approximately 51% and natural gas
for approximately 49% of TOTAL's combined liquids and natural gas
production in 2013.

The table on the next page sets forth by geographic area TOTAL’s
average daily production of liquids and natural gas for each of the
last three years.

Consistent with industry practice, TOTAL often holds a percentage
interest in its fields rather than a 100% interest, with the balance
being held by joint venture partners (which may include other
international oil companies, state-owned oil companies or
government entities). TOTAL frequently acts as operator (the party
responsible for technical production) on acreage in which it holds
an interest. See the table “Presentation of production activities by
geographic area” on the following pages for a description of
TOTAL's producing assets.

As in 2012 and 2011, substantially all of the liquids production

from TOTAL's Upstream segment in 2013 was marketed by the
Trading & Shipping division of TOTAL's Refining & Chemicals
segment (see table “Trading’s crude oil sales and supply and refined
products sales” on paragraph 3.2.1. of the present Chapter).

The majority of TOTAL's natural gas production is sold under long
term contracts. However, its North American production, and part
of its production from the United Kingdom, Norway and Argentina,
is sold on the spot market. The long-term contracts under which
TOTAL sells its natural gas usually provide for a price related to,
among other factors, average crude oil and other petroleum
product prices, as well as, in some cases, a cost-of-living index.
Though the price of natural gas tends to fluctuate in line with crude
cil prices, a slight delay may occur before changes in crude oil
prices are reflected in long-term natural gas prices. Due to the
interaction between the contract price of natural gas and crude

cil prices, contract prices are not usually affected by short-term
market fluctuations in the spot price of natural gas.

Some of TOTAL's long-term contracts, notably in Argentina,
Indonesia, Nigeria, Norway, Qatar and Russia, specify the delivery
of quantities of natural gas that may or may not be fixed and
determinable. Such delivery commitments vary substantially,

both in duration and in scope, from contract to contract throughout
the world. For example, in some cases, contracts require delivery
of natural gas on an as-needed basis, and, in other cases,
contracts call for the delivery of varied amounts of natural gas over
different periods of time. Nevertheless, TOTAL estimates the fixed
and determinable quantity of gas to be delivered over the period
2014-2016 to be 3,795 Bcf. The Group expects to satisfy most

of these obligations through the production of its proved reserves
of natural gas, with, if needed, additional sourcing from spot market
purchases (see Chapter 11, “Supplemental Oil and Gas Information
(Unaudited)” of this Registration Document).

2.1.7.1. Africa

In 2013, TOTAL’s production in Africa was 670 kboe/d,
representing 29% of the Group’s overall production,
compared to 713 kboe/d in 2012 and 659 kboe/d in 2011.

In South Africa, TOTAL acquired an interest in the 11B-12B license
(50%, operator) in September 2013. This license, which covers an
area of 19,000 km2, is located approximately 175 km south of the
South African coast in water depths ranging from 200 m to 1,800 m.
The drilling of an exploration well is planned for 2014.

In addition, in August 2013, the Group was granted approval by the
South African authorities to convert its technical cooperation license
for the Outeniqua Block (100%) into an exploration license, subject
to the sale by TOTAL of 20% of its stake, when the corresponding
license agreement will have been negociated and signed. The Outeniqua
Block, which covers approximately 76,000 km, is located to the
southwest of the 11B-12B license in water depths ranging from

400 m to 4,000 m. A 2D seismic campaign of 7,000 km combined
with sea bed core drilling activities is expected to be launched.

In Algeria, TOTAL's production was 21 kboe/d during 2013,
compared to 23 kboe/d in 2012 and 33 kboe/d in 2011.

The decline in production between 2011 and 2012 was mainly
due to the sale of TOTAL's interest in CEPSA (48.83%), which was
completed in July 2011. All of the Group's production in Algeria
now comes from the Tin Fouyé Tabenkort (TFT) field (35%). TOTAL
also has stakes of 37.75% and 47% in the Timimoun and Ahnet
gas development projects, respectively.

- On the TFT field, plateau production was maintained at 170 kboe/d.

— The development of the Timimoun field continued in 2013 and
the responses for the main calls for tender (plant construction
and drilling devices) have been reviewed. In February 2014,
the main contract was allocated. Commercial gas production
could start in 2017, with anticipated plateau production of
1.6 Bm*/year (160 Mcf/d). The 3D seismic survey of an area
of 2,240 km?, which started in December 2012, was completed
in July 2013. The data is currently being analyzed.

- Within the framework of the Ahnet project, discussions are
continuing between the project partners and the authorities,
particularly in light of the provisions of the new 13-02 oil
legislation, which provide greater incentives for the development
of unconventional hydrocarbons. The anticipated plateau
production is 4 Bm*/year (400 Mcf/d) as of 2018.

In Angola, the Group's production in 2013 was 186 kboe/d,
compared to 179 kboe/d in 2012 and 135 kboe/d in 2011, and
comes from Blocks 0, 14 and 17. Recent highlights include the
launch of the CLOV project in 2010, the start-up of production on
Pazflor in 2011, several discoveries on Blocks 15/06 and 17/06,
and, finally, the acquisition of interests in exploration Blocks 25,
39 and 40 in the Kwanza basin.

- Deep-offshore Block 17 (40%, operator) is TOTAL's principal asset
in Angola. It is composed of four major hubs: Girassol, Dalia,
Pazflor, which are all in production, and CLOV, which is currently
being developed. The Pazflor project, consisting of the Perpetua,
Zinia, Hortensia and Acacia fields, has achieved plateau production
(220 kb/d). The CLOV project, which was launched in 2010,
will result in the installation of a fourth Floating Production,

Business overview
Upstream

Storage and Offloading unit (FPSO) with a production capacity
of 160 kbd/d. Production start-up is expected mid-2014.

— On the ultra-deep-offshore Block 32 (30%, operator), the basic
engineering studies for the Kaombo project were completed
and the final investment decision is expected to be made
in the first half of 2014. The project will permit the development
of the discoveries made in the southeast portion of the block
through two FPSOs with a capacity in excess of 100 kb/d each.

- On Block 14 (20%")), production comes from the Tombua-Landana
and Kuito fields as well as the BBLT project, comprising the
Benguela, Belize, Lobito and Tomboco fields.

- Block 14K (36.75%) corresponds to the offshore unitization
zone between Angola (Block 14) and the Republic of Congo
(Haute Mer license). The development of the Lianzi field, which
was started in 2012, will be achieved by means of a connection
to the existing BBLT platform (Block 14). Production start-up
is planned for 2015. TOTAL's interest in the unitized block
is held 10% through Angola Block 14 BV and 26.75% through
Total E&P Congo.

- On Block 0 (10%), the development of Mafumeira Sul was
approved by the partners and the authorities in 2012. This
project constitutes the second phase of the development of
the Mafumeira field. Production start-up is planned for 2016.

- On Block 15/06 (15%), the development of a first production
hub, including the discoveries located in the northwest portion of
the block, began in early 2012. In February 2014, TOTAL signed an
agreement to sell its entire interest in block 15/06. The closing of
this transaction is expected during the first half of 2014.

TOTAL has operations on exploration Blocks 33 (58.67%, operator),
17/06 (30%, operator), 25 (35%, operator), 39 (15%) and 40 (50%,
operator). The Group plans to drill pre-salt targets in Blocks 25,

39 and 40 in 2014 in the deep offshore Kwanza basin. TOTAL
signed a disposal agreement to reduce its interest in Block 40

to 40%. The closing of this transaction is expected during the first
half of 2014.

TOTAL is also developing its LNG activities through the Angola
LNG project (13.6%), which includes a gas liquefaction plant near
Soyo supplied in particular by the gas associated with production
from Blocks 0, 14, 15, 17 and 18. LNG production started in
June 2013 but, due to various incidents, the plant has not yet
reached full capacity (5.2 Mt/y).

In Cameroon, TOTAL no longer holds any exploration or
production assets since the sale of its subsidiary Total E&P
Cameroun in 2011. Production was 3 kboe/d in 2011.

In Céte d’lvoire, TOTAL is active in four deep offshore exploration
licenses located 50 km to 100 km from the coast and covering
approximately 5,200 km? at water depths ranging from 1,000 m to
3,000 m.

TOTAL is the operator of the Cl-100 (60%) license in the Tano basin
and holds stakes in the Cl-514 (54%, operator), Cl-515 (45%) and
Cl-516 (45%) licenses in the San Pedro basin.

A comprehensive 3D seismic survey has been conducted on the
Cl-100 license and an first exploration well (Ivoire-1X) was drilled
in early 2013 in the northwest portion of the block at a water depth

of more than 2,300 m. This well has encountered a good-quality oil
horizon. The recorded data is currently undergoing analysis in order
to assess the potential of the discovered reservoirs and define

an exploration and additional works program.

A 3D seismic survey campaign covering the whole of the three
licenses Cl-514, Cl-515 and Cl-516 was completed in

December 2012. The interpretation of the data is on going.
Following the drilling of a first exploration well on license Cl-514,
two more wells are due to be drilled on licenses Cl-515 and Cl-516
during the course of 2014.

In Egypt, TOTAL is the operator of Block 4 (East El Burullus
Offshore) and reduced its stake in this license from 90% to 50%

in January 2013. The license, located in the Nile river basin, covers
a 4-year initial exploration period and includes a commitment to
carrying out 3D seismic work and drilling exploration wells. Following
the 3D seismic campaign covering 3,374 km? that was conducted
in 2011, an exploration well (Kala-1) was drilled in late 2013, whose
results have been disappointing.

In Gabon, the Group's production in 2013 was 59 kboe/d
compared to 57 kboe/d in 2012 and 58 kboe/d in 2011.

The Group's exploration and production activities in Gabon are
mainly carried out by Total Gabon", one of the Group's oldest
subsidiaries in sub-Saharan Africa.

- As part of the Anguille field redevelopment project (estimated
production capacity of 20 kboe/d), the AGM North platform, from
which twenty-one additional development wells are expected to
be drilled, was installed in 2012. Production started as planned
with two wells in March 2013.

On the deep-offshore Diaba license, the operator Total Gabon
sold off part of its interest in 2012 and now has a stake of
42.5%. An initial exploration well (Diaman-1B) was drilled during
2013 at a water depth of more than 1,700 m. This well revealed
an accumulation of gas and condensates in the pre-salt
reservoirs of the Gamba Formation. Data analysis is currently
underway in order to assess this discovery and reassess the
surrounding prospects.

The Nguongui-updip well was drilled on the Mutamba-lroru
license (50%) in 2012 and revealed the presence of hydrocarbons.
Work is currently being conducted to evaluate the commercial
viability of this discovery. A 2D seismic survey was conducted
on the Nziembou license (20%) in 2012. Drilling preparation
activities are being conducted for a first exploration well
scheduled in 2014.

In Kenya, TOTAL acquired a 40% stake in five offshore licenses

in the Lamu basin in 2011, namely licenses L5, L7, L11a, L11b
and L12, representing a total surface area of more than 30,600 km?
at water depths of between 100 m and 3,000 m. Following the 3D
seismic survey campaign covering 3,500 km? that was conducted
during the initial exploration period, 25% of the surface area of the
five blocks was relinquished. In 2013, two exploration wells were
drilled in Blocks L7 and L11b, but did not result in positive results.
In 2012, the results Group also acquired the L22 offshore license
(100%, operator), located in the same basin and covering a surface
area of more than 10,000 km? in water depths ranging from 2,000
m to 3,500 m. In December 2013, TOTAL sold 30% of its stake in
this license. A 2D seismic survey and sea core drilling operations
are planned for 2014 on the L22 offshore license.

In Libya, the Group's production in 2013 was 50 kb/d compared
to 62 kb/d in 2012 and 20 kb/d in 2011. TOTAL is a partner in the
following contract zones: 15, 16 & 32 (75%), 70 & 87 (75%),
129 & 130 (30%) and 130 & 131 (24%) and Block NC191
(100% !, operator).

Production which, in 2012, had returned to its level prior

to the events of 2011 was affected from mid-2013 onward by
the blockade of most of the country’s terminals and pipelines due
to social and political unrest.

- In onshore zones 70 and 87 (Mabruk), production has been
affected since August 2013 due to the blockade of the Es Sider
export terminal. Development of the Garian field was approved
in July 2013 and production at the field is expected to start
in the third quarter 2014.

- In onshore zones 129, 130 and 131, production was stopped
in 2013 during several months due to the blocking of the
production installation and the evacuation pipeline. The seismic
survey campaign, which was interrupted in 2011 due to force
majeure, has not yet resumed. However, the exploration of these
blocks continued in 2013 with the drilling of three wells.

In the onshore Murzuk basin, a plan for the development of Block NC
191 was submitted to the authorities in 2009. Discussions have resu-
med following the interruptions associated with the events of 2011.

In offshore zones 15, 16 and 32 (Al Jurf), production has not
been affected by the social unrest in the country. The drilling of
two exploration wells scheduled for the second quarter of 2013
was postponed due to technical reasons. The first of these wells
was started at the end of 2013.

In Madagascar, TOTAL is active on the Bemolanga 3102 license
(60%, operator). Since the exploitation of oil sand accumulations

is no longer planned, TOTAL is refocusing on the conventional
exploration of the block, which is expected to continue in 2014 with
a 2D seismic survey following the approval of an additional 2-year
extension of the exploration phase by the local authorities.

In Morocco, the Anzarane offshore reconnaissance contract
covering an offshore zone of 100,000 km?, which was granted
in December 2011 to TOTAL and ONHYM (National Bureau

of Petroleum and Mines), was extended for one year in
December 2013. A 3D seismic survey campaign covering
5,900 km* that started in late 2012 was completed in July 2013.
The collected data is currently being processed.

In Mauritania, the Group has exploration operations on the Ta7
and Ta8 licenses (60%, operator) located in the Taoudenni basin.

In 2012, TOTAL acquired interests in two exploration licenses
(90%, operator): Block C9 in ultra-deep offshore, and Block Ta29
onshore in the Taoudenni basin. During 2013, TOTAL sold 18% of
its stake in Block Ta29, but retains operatorship and a 72% interest.

- Following a 2D seismic survey performed in 2011 on license Ta7,
well Ta7-1 was drilled in 2013. Tests have been conducted,
but they did not allow to highlight hydrocarbons in commercial
quantity.

- On Block Ta29, a 900 km? seismic was performed in 2012.
The processing and the interpretation of these seismic data
have been completed. Studies are underway to identify a
prospect on this block.

- A3D seismic survey campaign covering 4,700 km? was
conducted on Block C9 in 2013. The data is currently being
processed and interpreted.

In Mozambique, TOTAL acquired in 2012 a 40% stake in the
production sharing contract regarding offshore Blocks 3 and 6.
Located in the Rovuma basin, these two blocks cover a total
surface area of 15,250 km? in water depths ranging from 0 m to
2,500 m. An exploration well was drilled in 2012 and half of the
surface area of the two blocks was relinquished in 2013 at the start
of the second exploration period.

In Nigeria, Group production in 2013 was 261 kboe/d compared to
279 kboe/d in 2012 and 287 kboe/d in 2011. These declines are
primarily due to the sharp increase in oil bunkering and in 2013

the blockade of Nigeria LNG export cargos. Despite such factors
negatively affecting production, Nigeria remained the main
contributor to the Group's production.

TOTAL, which has been present in the country since 1962,
operates six production licenses (OML) out of the thirty-eight in
which it has a stake, and one out of the four exploration licenses
(OPL) in which it is present.

Regarding variations in TOTAL's licenses:

- In September 2013, TOTAL was granted approval by the
authorities to increase its stake in exploration license OPL 285
from 26.67% to 60%. In May 2013, TOTAL obtained the
approval of the authorities for the renewal of licenses OML 99,
100 and 102 for a period of twenty years.

- On the OML 138 license (20%), TOTAL started production in the
Usan offshore field in 2012 (180 kb/d, FPSO capacity), which
reached the level of 130 kboe/d in 2013. Since February 2014,
TOTAL is no longer the operator of the OML 138 license.

In 2012, TOTAL signed an agreement for the sale of its 20%
stake in Block OML 138. The approval by the authorities has
not yet been received.

- TOTAL decided not to continue its exploration activities in JDZ
Block 1 (48.6%, operator) following the analysis of the results of
wells drilled in 2012. Block was relinquished in September 2013.
Also, the Block OPL 221 was relinquished in November 2013.

— TOTAL sold its 10% stake in Blocks OML 26 and 42 in 2011
and in Blocks OML 30, 34 and 40 in 2012. These interests
had previously been indirectly controlled via the joint venture
Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC).

TOTAL continues, with its developments, to meet the growing
domestic demand for gas and to strengthen its ability to supply
gas to the LNG projects in which it owns a stake:

- As part of its joint venture with the Nigerian National Petroleum
Company (NNPC), TOTAL is pursuing the project to increase the
gas production capacity of the OML 58 license (40%, operator)
from 370 Mcf/d to 550 Mcf/d.

— On the OML 102 license (40%, operator), TOTAL is continuing to
develop the Ofon phase 2 project, which was launched in 2011,
with an expected capacity of 70 kboe/d and production start-up is
scheduled for the end of 2014. In 2011, the Group also discovered
Etisong North, located 15 km from the currently-producing Ofon
field. The exploration campaign continued in 2012 with the drilling
of the Eben well, which is also south of Ofon. The positive results
produced by this well further enhance the interest of the future
Etisong-Eben development hub as a satellite of the Ofon field.

Business overview
Upstream

— On the OML 130 license (24%, operator), the development of the
Egina field (capacity of 200 kboe/d) was launched in June 2013
and contracts have been awarded. Production start-up is
expected at year-end 2017.

- On the OML 99 license (40%, operator), engineering work
is underway to develop the Ikike field, where production is
expected to start in 2017 (estimated capacity of 55 kboe/d).

— On the OML 112/117 licenses (40%), development studies have
been suspended waiting for the resolution of contractual issues
that arose in 2013.

— TOTAL is also active in the LNG sector with a 15% holding in the
company Nigeria LNG, which possesses a liquefaction plant of a
total capacity of 22 Mt/y. In addition, TOTAL holds a 17% stake
in Brass LNG, which is continuing to study the project for a gas
liquefaction plant with two LNG trains of a capacity of 5 Mt/y each.

The production that is not operated by the Group in Nigeria comes.
mainly from the SPDC joint venture, in which TOTAL holds a 10%
stake. The sharp increase of oil bunkering in 2013 had an impact
on onshore production, as well as on the integrity of the facilities
and the local environment.

In addition, TOTAL also holds a 12.5% stake in the OML 118
deep-offshore license. In connection with this license, the Bonga
field contributed 15 kboe/d to Group production in 2013. The
partners continued the development of the Bonga Northwest
project in 2013. On the OML 118 license, a pre-unitization
agreement relating to the Bonga South West discovery has
been signed in December 2013.

In Uganda, TOTAL has been active since 2012 and holds a 33.33%
interest in the EA-1, EA-1A and EA-2 licenses as well as the Kingfisher
license. All of these licenses are located in the Lake Albert region, where
cil resources have already been discovered. TOTAL is the operator
of licenses EA-1 and EA-1A and a partner on the other licenses.

- On the appraisal license EA-1, a campaign of wells, production
tests and a 3D seismic survey are underway. Five development
plans will be submitted to the authorities before the end of 2014:
Ngiri (submitted in December 2013), Jobi-Rii (April 2014), and
Mpyo, Gunya and Jobi East (December 2014).

- The EA-1A license expired in February 2013, following a campaign
involving the drilling of five exploration wells that resulted in one
discovery (Lyec). With the exception of the scope relating to this
discovery, the license has been returned to the authorities.

- On the appraisal license EA-2, the campaign of wells and production
tests started in 2012 continued during 2013. An additional well is
due to be drilled in 2014. Two development plans were submitted
to the authorities in June 2013 (Kasamene and Wahrindi fields,
as well as those of Kigogole, Ngege, Ngara and Nsoga).

- The development plan for the Kingfisher field, which is located
on the EA-3 production license, was approved by the authorities
in September 2013. The basic engineering studies are currently
being prepared.

- The Kanywataba exploration well was drilled in June 2012 with
negative results. The Kanywataba license expired in August 2012
and was returned to the authorities.

At the initiative of the Ugandan government, discussions are
underway concerning the construction of a refinery that will be
developed in two phases (30 kb/d in the first phase followed
by a second phase providing an additional 30 kb/d), as well as
an export pipeline.

Business overview
Upstream

In the Republic of Congo, the Group's production in 2013 was
93 kboe/d compared to 113 kboe/d in 2012 and 123 kboe/d in
2011. The decrease in production was due in particular to the end
of plateau production at Moho Bilondo in mid-2010 and to a
planned shut-down on the Nkossa field.

- The development of the Lianzi field was approved in 2012.
Located in the offshore unitization zone Block 14K (36.75%)
between Angola and the Republic of Congo (Haute Mer license),
this field will be developed by a tieback to the existing Benguela-
Belize-Lobito-Tomboco platform (Block 14 in Angola). Production
start-up is expected in 2015. TOTAL’s interest in the unitized
block is held 26.75% through Total E&P Congo and 10% through
Angola Block 14 BV.

- The Moho Bilondo offshore field (53.5%, operator) reached
plateau production of 90 kboe/d in mid-2010. The field has now
started its decline. The Phase 1b and Moho North projects were
launched in March 2013 following agreements on the contractual
and fiscal conditions in 2012. Production start-up is planned for
2015 and 2016, respectively, with estimated production capacity
of 140 kboe/d (40 kboe/d for Phase 1b and 100 kboe/d for
Moho North).

— Production at Libondo (65%, operator), which is part of the
Kombi-Likalala-Libondo operating license, started in 2011.
Plateau production reached 12 kboe/d in 2011.

- In July 2013, TOTAL obtained the Haute Mer B license
(34.62%, operator) in association with other partners.

- As part of the renewal of the Loango and Zatchi licenses, an
agreement on the related contractual and fiscal conditions was
signed in October 2013. This agreement is subject to approval
by the parliament. TOTAL's interest in these licenses will change
respectively from 50% to 42.50% for Loango and from 35% to
29.75% for Zatchi with a retroactive effect in October 2013.

— In December 2013, in connection with a share capital increase
of Total E&P Congo, Qatar Petroleum International Upstream (QPI)
entered into the share capital of this subsidiary at a level of 15%.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, following the
Presidential decree approving TOTAL's entry in 2011 as operator
with a 60% interest in Block III of the Graben Albertine, the
exploration permit was issued in January 2012 by the Minister

of Hydrocarbons for a period of three years and subsequently
extended by an additional year due to the postponement of the
works in light of the general security situation in the eastern part
of the country. This block is located in the Lake Albert region.
TOTAL acquired an additional 6.66% of this block in March 2012.
The prospecting program is limited to the northern portion of the
license, which is outside the Virunga park. A helicopter acquisition
of gravimetric and magnetic data was completed in August 2012
with encouraging results. The 2D seismic survey campaign
prepared in 2013 is scheduled to start in 2014.

In the Republic of South Sudan, TOTAL is negotiating a new
contract with the state authorities that would make it possible to
resume exploration activities in part of Block B. Since the
independence of the Republic of South Sudan on July 9, 2011,
TOTAL is no longer present in Sudan.

2.1.7.2. North America

In 2013, TOTAL’s production in North America was 73 kboe/d,
representing 3% of the Group’s total production, compared to
69 kboe/d in 2012 and 67 kboe/d in 2011.

In Canada, the Group’s production in 2013 was 13 kboe/d
compared to 12 kboe/d in 2012 and 11 kboe/d in 2011. The Group's
oil sands portfolio is focused around two main hubs: on the one
hand, a Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) hub focused on
continuing developments at Surmont's (560%), and, on the other, a
mining hub, which includes the Joslyn (38.25%, operator), Fort Hills
(39.2%) and Northern Lights (60%, operator) mining projects as
well as a 100% stake in a number of oil sands leases acquired
through a series of auction sales.

— On the Surmont lease, additional wells were drilled in 2013 in
order to optimize production. The decision to construct an
additional steam generation unit was also made with the same
aim in mind. The drilling of additional wells is expected to
continue in 2014.

In early 2010, the partners involved in the project decided to
launch the construction of the second development phase.
The goal of production start-up from Surmont Phase 2 has been
set for 2015 and overall production capacity from the field is
expected to increase to 130 kboe/d.

- On the Fort Hills project (production capacity estimated at 180 kb/d),
the final investment decision was made in October 2013.
Site preparation work is underway and production start-up is
planned for the end of 2017.

- On the Joslyn license, engineering studies are currently being
conducted in order to optimize production from the Joslyn North
Mine project.

- In March 2013, TOTAL concluded an agreement for the sale
of its 49% stake in the Voyageur upgrader project.

In the United States, the Group's production in 2013 was 60 kboe/d
compared to 57 kboe/d in 2012 and 56 kboe/d in 2011.

— Inthe Gulf of Mexico:

- Phase 2 of the deep-offshore Tahiti oil field (17%) was launched
in 2010. This phase comprises drilling four injection wells and
two producing wells. The injection of water started in 2012.
The first producing well was put into operation in late 2013
and the second producing well, the drilling of which is currently
being completed, is due to start production in 2014.

The Chinook 4 well in the deep-offshore Chinook project
(33.33%) started production in the third quarter of 2012.
Drilling of the Chinook 5 well was completed in 2013

and started production in early 2014.

The TOTAL (40%) — Cobalt (60%, operator) alliance’s
exploratory drilling campaign, which was launched in 2009,
was resumed in 2012 after the U.S. government lifted the
moratorium on deep-offshore drilling operations. This resulted
in the drilling of the Ligurian 2 well (dry well) together with the
North Platte well at which a major oil discovery was made
and for which studies are currently being conducted. Results
from the Ardennes well, which was drilled in 2013, gave
disappointing results, just like the Aegean well, which was
completed in December 2013. The Aegean well is the last
one of the drilling campaign.

- TOTAL is active in shale gas production in Texas and has a 25%
stake in the Chesapeake portfolio in the Barnett Shale basin
through its participation in a joint venture with Chesapeake.
Given the drop in gas prices in the United States, drilling
operations have been sharply reduced from 2012 onwards
(approximately sixty wells drilled in 2013 compared to
100 in 2012 and more than 300 in 2011).

TOTAL is also active in the production of shale gas in Ohio and
has a 25% stake in the liquid-rich Utica shale gas play through
a joint venture with Chesapeake and EnerVest. More than

200 liquids-rich gas wells were drilled in 2013 (compared to
approximately 100 in 2012) and approximately 190 of these
have been connected and started producing (compared to
forty-seven in 2012).

Engineers from TOTAL are assigned to the teams led by
Chesapeake.

- The Group holds a 50% stake in American Shale Oil LLC (AMSO)
to develop in situ shale oil technology. The first in situ heating
tests have been performed and are resulting in adaptations to
the selected technology.

— In 2012, TOTAL entered into a 50/50 association with Red Leaf
Resources for the ex situ development of oil shale and agreed
to fund a production pilot before any larger-scale development.
In addition, TOTAL finalized an agreement to purchase
approximately 120 km? of additional land in Colorado and Utah,
with a view to developing in situ shale oil techniques (AMSO
technique) or ex situ techniques (Red Leaf technique).

In Mexico, TOTAL is conducting various studies with state-owned
PEMEX under a general technical cooperation agreement renewed
in July 2011 for a period of five years.

2.1.7.3. South America

In 2013, TOTAL’s production in South America was 166 kboe/d,
representing 7% of the Group’s total production, compared to
182 kboe/d in 2012 and 188 kboe/d in 2011.

In Argentina, where TOTAL has been present since 1978, the
Group operated about 30%") of the country’s production in 2013.
The Group's production in 2013 was 78 kboe/d compared to

83 kboe/d in 2012 and 86 kboe/d in 2011. In order to encourage
investment in exploration and production, the Argentinean
government has concluded gas price agreements with various
producers as of December 2012. Under the terms of these
agreements, the Argentinean government guarantees the price
of gas for quantities above a fixed production level in exchange
for compliance with defined production targets and applicable
penalties (.e., “Deliver or Pay”). In February 2013, TOTAL

signed an agreement of this type for a period of five years

with retroactive effect from December 1, 2012.

- In Tierra del Fuego, the Group notably operates the Carina and
Aries offshore fields (37.5%). Following the re-appraisal of the
reserves of the Carina field, three additional wells are expected
to be drilled from the existing platform. These wells should allow
production levels from the facilities operated by the Group in
Tierra del Fuego to be maintained at about 630 Mcf/d until
the Vega Pleyade field (37.5%, operator) starts up in 2015.
Development of this field started in October 2013.

Business overview
Upstream

- In the Neuquén basin, TOTAL started a drilling campaign
on its mining licenses in 2011 in order to assess their shale gas
and oil potential. In 2012 and 2013, this campaign, which started
on the Aguada Pichana license (27.3%, operator), was extended
to all the blocks operated by the Group: San Roque (24.7%,
operator), Rincdn la Ceniza and La Escalonada (85%, operator),
Aguada de Castro (42.5%, operator), and Pampa de las Yeguas
II (42.5%, operator), as well as to the blocks operated by third
parties: Cerro Las Minas (40%), Cerro Partido (45%), Rincén de
Aranda (45%), and Veta Escondida (45%). The first results, all
positive, of the production tests on the wells drilled during this
campaign permit envisaging various development scenarios in
the region. A pilot development intended to test the unconventional
production potential at the Aguada Pichana Block is expected
to enter into production in late 2014.

In Bolivia, the Group's production, primarily gas, was 28 kboe/d
in 2013 compared to 27 kboe/d in 2012 and 25 kboe/d in 2011.
TOTAL has stakes in seven licenses: three production licenses,
San Alberto and San Antonio (15%) and Block XX Tarija Oeste
(41%), two licenses in the development phase, Aquio and Ipati
(60%, operator), and two licenses in the exploration or appraisal
phase, Rio Hondo (50%) and Azero (50%, operator).

- Production started in 2011 on the Itat gas and condensates
field located on Block XX Tarija Oeste; it is routed to the existing
facilities of the neighboring San Alberto field. Phase 2 of the
development of the field entered into production at the end
of 2013.

- In 2004, TOTAL discovered the Incahuasi gas field on the
Ipati Block. In 2011 and 2013, two additional wells confirmed
the extension of the discovery northwards onto the adjacent
Aquio Block as well as southwards onto the Ipati license.

In April 2013, TOTAL was granted approval by the authorities

to start development of Phase 1 of the project, including the
connection of three existing drilled wells tied to a central
processing plant of 6.5 Mm*/d. The key contracts relating to the
construction of the plant and its connection to the export
network were granted in October 2013. In July 2013, TOTAL
sold 20% stakes in the Aquio and Ipati fields thereby reducing its
interest in these fields from 80 to 60%.

In August 2013, TOTAL acquired a 50% stake in the Azero
exploration license in the Andean Piedmont. This is located
to the west of the Ipati and Aquio Blocks and covers an area
of more than 7,800 km?.

Brazil, the Group has stakes in fourteen exploration licenses.

In October 2013, TOTAL acquired a 20% stake in the Libra field.
This field is currently being assessed and is the largest pre-salt
oil field discovered to date in the Santos basin off the coast

of Brazil. The field is located in very deep water (2,000 m)
approximately 170 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro and covers
an area of 1,550 km?. Additional exploration works including
contractual obligations to be realized by the end of 2017 and
appraisal and development studies of the field were launched.

Following the eleventh call for tender organized by the Brazilian
authorities in May 2013, TOTAL acquired a stake in ten new
operating licenses. Holding a 40% stake, the Group operates
five blocks (FZA-M-57, FZA-M-86, FZA-M-88, FZA-M-125 and
FZA-M-127) located in the Foz do Amazonas basin and has a

45% interest in a block (CE-M-661) located in the Ceara basin.
TOTAL also has a 25% stake in three blocks (ES-M-669,
ES-M-671 and ES-M-743) located in the Espirito Santo basin
and a 50% share in another block (BAR-M-346) located in

the Barreirinhas basin.

- TOTAL also has a stake in the Xerelete field, which the Group
has operated since 2012. This stake is primarily located on Block
BC-2 (41.2%) and extends into Block BM-C-14 (50%). The drilling
of a well targeting pre-salt horizons was launched at the beginning
of January 2014.

— Awell was drilled in 2012 in the Gato Do Mato field, which is
located in Block BM-S-54 (20%) and was discovered in the
Santos basin in 2010. The encouraging results are currently
being analyzed in order to define the next stages in the
assessment of the field.

In Colombia, TOTAL no longer has production since the sale in
2012 of one of its subsidiaries, TEPMA BV, which held a stake in
the Cusiana field. Production was 6 kboe/d in 2012 and 11 kboe/d
in 2011.

Following the discovery of Huron-1 on the Niscota (60%) license
in 2009 and the drilling of the second well, Huron-2, which yielded
positive test results in April 2013, a third well, Huron-3, was drilled
with disappointing results. The conceptual development studies
have started for a declaration of commerciality that is expected
during the second quarter of 2014.

After selling 10% of its stake in the Ocensa pipeline in 2011 and
reducing its interest in this asset to 5.2%, TOTAL sold its entire
stake in 2013, but kept its transport rights. TOTAL has relinquished
its stakes in the OAM and ODC pipelines that were previously

held by TEPMA BV.

In French Guiana, TOTAL owns a 25% stake in the Guyane
Maritime license. This license, located approximately 150 km from
the coast in water depths ranging from 200 m to 3,000 m, covers
an area of approximately 24,000 km2. At the end of 2011, the
authorities extended the research permit until May 31, 2016.

In 2011, drilling at the GM-ES-1 well, which is located on the
Zaedyus prospect at a water depth of more than 2,000 m, revealed
two hydrocarbon columns in sandstone reservoirs. Two 3D seismic
survey campaigns covering a total area of more than 5,000 km?
were conducted in the center and extreme eastern portions of

the block in 2012. A drilling campaign consisting of four wells was
conducted from July 2012 until the end of 2013. The results

of this campaign did not make it possible to prove the extension

of an exploitable reservoir but the results did provided additional
information that is currently being analyzed.

In Trinidad and Tobago, where TOTAL has been active since
1996, the Group's production in 2013 was 12 kboe/d compared to
16 kboe/d in 2012 and 12 kboe/d in 2011. In September 2013,
TOTAL sold all of its exploration and production assets by
disposing of the companies Total E&P Trinidad BV, which held

a 30% stake in the Angostura offshore field located in Block 2C,
and Elf Exploration Trinidad BV, which owned an 8.5% share in the
adjacent exploration Block 3A. The Group no longer owns any
exploration or production assets in the country.

In Uruguay, TOTAL holds a 100% stake in three exploration
licenses: offshore Block 14, and onshore Blocks B1 and B2.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

- In October 2013, TOTAL signed two exploration and production
contracts for Blocks B1 and B2 for unconventional plays.
These two blocks, which cover a total area of 5,200 km?, are
primarily located in the Artigas province in the northwestern part
of the country. The commitments undertaken in respect of these
licenses relate to the conduct of geological, geochemical and
environmental studies.

- In 2012, TOTAL acquired a stake in Block 14, which is located
approximately 250 km offshore in water depths ranging from
2,000 m to 3,500 m and covers an area of some 6,700 km?.
In particular, TOTAL agreed to conduct a 3D seismic survey of
the entire block, which was completed in early 2014.

The Group has also agreed to drill one well in the first 3-year
exploration phase.

In Venezuela, where TOTAL has had operations since 1980, the
Group's production was 48 kboe/d in 2013 compared to 50 kboe/d
in 2012 and 54 kboe/d in 2011. TOTAL has equity stakes in
PetroCedefio (30.3%), which produces and upgrades extra heavy
oil in the Orinoco Belt, in Yucal Placer (69.5%), which produces gas
dedicated to the domestic market, and in the offshore exploration
Block 4, located in Plataforma Deltana (49%). The development
phase of the southern zone of the PetroCedenfo field, which started
in 2011, is continuing with forty-three producing wells having been
drilled at the end of 2013. The postponement of a debottlenecking
project in addition with a performance study performed on the field
in 2013 led to a revision of PetroCedefio’s reserves. Pursuant to an
amendment to the gas sale contract, a new development phase

of the Yucal Placer field, which is expected to boost the production
capacity from 100 Mcf/d to 300 Mcf/d, was launched in June 2012.

2.1.7.4. Asia-Pacific

In 2013, TOTAL’s production in Asia-Pacific was 235 kboe/d,
representing 10% of the Group’s total production, compared
to 221 kboe/d in 2012 and 231 kboe/d in 2011.

In Australia, the Group produced 4 kboe/d in 2013 compared to

5 kboe/d in 2012 and 4 kboe/d in 2011. TOTAL has held leasehold
rights in the country since 2005. The Group owns 30% of the
Ichthys project, 27.5% of the Gladstone LNG project (GLNG),

and nine offshore exploration licenses off the northwest coast

in the Browse, Bonaparte and Carnarvon basins, including five that
it operates, as well as four onshore shale gas exploration licenses
in the southern part of the South Georgina basin. The acquisition of
the fourth license located in the Northern Territory remains subject
to the approval of authorities.

— In early 2013, TOTAL acquired an additional 6% in the Ichthys
project, increasing its stake to 30%. This project, launched in
early 2012, is aimed at the development of the Ichthys gas and
condensates field located in the Browse basin. This development
includes a floating platform designed for gas production,
treatment and export, an FPSO (with a maximum capacity
of 100 kb/d of condensates) to stabilize and export condensates,
an 889 km gas pipeline and an onshore liquefaction plant
(capacities of 8.4 Mt/y of LNG and 1.6 Mt/y of NGL) located in
Darwin. The LNG has already been sold mainly to Asian buyers
under long-term contracts. Production start-up is expected at
year-end 2016.

— TOTAL has an indirect interest of 27.5% in the GLNG project.
This integrated gas production, transport and liquefaction project
is based on the development of coal gas from the Fairview,


--- Page 27 ---

Roma, Scotia and Arcadia fields. The final investment decision
was made in early 2011 and start-up is expected in 2015.
LNG production is expected to eventually reach 7.2 Mt/y.

The Upstream development of the project and the construction
of the gas pipeline and liquefaction plant are underway.

In June 2013, the WA-492 and WA-498 licenses in the Carnarvon
basin were awarded to TOTAL (100%, operator). TOTAL has
undertaken to conduct a 2D seismic survey on these licenses
during the coming years.

At the end of 2012, TOTAL reduced its share in the WA-408
license located in the Browse basin (60%, operator) by disposing
of 50% of its stake to partners. Two exploration wells were drilled
in 2013. The first well, Bassett West 1, which was drilled during
the first half of 2013, highlighted hydrocarbons. Studies are
currently underway. The second one, which was completed

at the end of 2013, has been definitively abandoned due to

the negative results obtained.

In 2012, TOTAL signed an agreement to enter four shale gas
exploration licenses in the South Georgina basin in the center
of the country. This agreement, which allows TOTAL to increase
its stake to 68% and become the operator in the event of
development, has now been finalized. Work started on

the three blocks in Queensland during the course of 2013

in the form of a 2D seismic survey that was acquired during

the second half of the year. The first exploration wells are due
to be drilled during 2014.

- Two wells were drilled in 2011 on the WA-408 license (60%,
operator) in the Bonaparte basin. As one well demonstrated the
presence of hydrocarbons, additional appraisal work was
performed on this block during 2013, including a 3D seismic
survey, the results of which are currently being interpreted.

In Brunei, where TOTAL has been present since 1986, the Group
operates the offshore Maharaja Lela Jamalulalam gas and
condensates field located on Block B (37.5%). The Group's
production in 2013 was 13 kboe/d compared to 12 kboe/d in 2012
and 13 kboe/d in 2011. The gas is delivered to the Brunei LNG
liquefaction plant.

The study of the development project started in 2010 for the
production of the new reserves discovered in the south of the field
(Maharaja Leila South) was finalized in 2013. The project was
officially launched in early 2014 with the execution of most

of the related industrial contracts and with the formal signature

of the 20-year extension of the present petroleum contract.

Studies are currently being conducted to reassess the potential
of deep-offshore exploration Block CA1 (54%, operator) and

are expected to result in a new operating strategy. In addition,
discussions have started in the perspective of possible unitization
with regards to the hydrocarbon identified in the southeast part
of the block (Jagus East well) in 2012 and the discovery made
by BSP (Geronggong) in a neighboring block.

In China, TOTAL has been present since 2006 on the South Sulige
Block located in the Ordos basin in the Inner Mongolia province.
Following appraisal work by TOTAL, China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC) and TOTAL agreed to a development plan
pursuant to which CNPC is the operator and TOTAL has a 49%
stake. The first development wells have been drilled and test-phase
production has been underway since August 2012. The Group's
production in 2013 was 8 kboe/d compared to 1 kboe/d in 2012.

Business overview
Upstream

In March 2013, TOTAL and Sinopec concluded a joint study
agreement relating to shale gas potential on the Xuancheng license
(4,000 km?) close to Nanjing. 2D seismic survey activities have been
realized from October 2013 to February 2014 (600 km). A drilling
campaign is scheduled for 2014 and 2015. If the results of this
campaign are favorable, an agreement relating to the long-term
development of these resources might subsequently be negotiated
with Sinopec.

In Indonesia, where TOTAL has had operations since 1968,
the Group's production in 2013 was 131 kboe/d compared to
132 kboe/d in 2012 and 158 kboe/d in 2011.

TOTAL's operations in Indonesia are primarily concentrated on the
Mahakam permit (560%, operator), which covers in particular the
Peciko and Tunu gas fields. TOTAL also has a stake in the Sisi-Nubi
gas field (47.9%, operator). The Group delivers most of its natural
gas production to the Bontang LNG plant. The overall capacity

of the eight liquefaction trains at this plant is 22 Mt/y.

In 2013, TOTAL's gas production operations amounted to 1,757 Mcf/d.
This value is down from the 2012 production level (1,871 Mcf/d)
due to the maturity of most of the fields on the Mahakam permit,
even though this decline was partially offset in 2013 by an increase
in production in the South Mahakam fields. The gas operated and
delivered by TOTAL accounted for approximately 80% of Bontang’s
LNG supply. This gas production is supplemented by condensate
and oil production from the Handil and Bekapai fields, which are
operated by the Group.

- With regard to the Mahakam permit:

- On the Tunu field, in 2013, additional development wells were
drilled in the main reservoir alongside in the shallow gas
reservoirs.

- On the Peciko field, Phase 7 drilling, which started in 2009,
is continuing.

- On South Mahakam, where production started in 2012 and
which contains the Stupa, West Stupa and East Mandu
condensate gas fields, other development wells are currently
being drilled.

- On the Sisi-Nubi field, which began production in 2007, drilling
operations are continuing within the framework of a second
phase of development. The gas from Sisi-Nubi is produced
through Tunu’s processing facilities.

On the Sebuku license (15%), production started at the Ruby gas
field in October 2013. Production capacity is estimated at 100 Mcf/d.
Ruby's production is transported by pipeline for processing and
separation at the Senipah terminal operated by TOTAL.

On the Sageri exploration Block (50%), the first exploration well
(Lempuk-1X), completed in early 2012, produced negative
results. The license is currently being relinquished.

On the South East Mahakam exploration Block (50%, operator),
the Tongkol South-1 exploration well, completed in September 2013,
produced negative results.

In 2013, TOTAL took the necessary steps vis-a-vis the
authorities to withdraw from the Sadang (30%), Arafura Sea
(24.5%) and Amborip VI (24.5%) Blocks. In addition, and
following the withdrawal of the other partners, the Group’s
stake in the South Sageri Block increased from 45% to
100% (operator), while its share in the South Mandar Block
increased from 33% to 49.3%.

Business overview
Upstream

— In February 2013, TOTAL sold 10% in the South West Bird's
Head exploration Block (90%, operator). This block is located
onshore and offshore in the Salawati basin in the province of
West Papua. Results from the Anggrek Hitam 1 exploration well,
where drilling was completed in September 2013, were negative.

— In 2012, TOTAL acquired a 100% stake in the exploration Block
Bengkulu | — Mentawai in the offshore Bengkulu basin, southwest
of Sumatra. The preparatory work on the Rendang 1 exploration
well started at the end of 2013 and drilling start-up is planned
during the first half of 2014. The Group also acquired a stake in
the exploration Block Telen (100%, operator) in the offshore Kutai
basin in East Kalimantan province.

— In 2011, the Group acquired an 18.4% stake in a coal bed
methane (CBM) block on Kutai II in East Kalimantan province
as well as a 50% stake in the similar Kutai Timur Block.

In Malaysia, on deep-offshore exploration Block SK 317 B
(85%, operator), which is located in Sarawak, an exploration well
was started in December 2013. Following disappointing geological
exploration results, TOTAL withdrew from the PM303 offshore
exploration block at the start of 2011 and should do the same for
the PM324 license (60%, operator) in May 2014 upon expiration
of the operating period. An agreement has been reached with the
regulator to convert the second commitment well on PM324 into
expenditures on other exploration blocks.

In Myanmar, Group production in 2013 was 16 kboe/d compared
to 16 kboe/d in 2012 and 15 kboe/d in 2011. TOTAL is the operator
of the Yadana field (31.2%). This field, which is located on offshore
Blocks M5 and M6, primarily produces gas for delivery to PTT

(the Thai state-owned company) for use in Thai power plants.

The Yadana field also supplies the domestic market via

two pipelines built and operated by MOGE, a Myanmar
state-owned company.

In 2012, TOTAL acquired a 40% share in a production sharing
agreement on the M-11 offshore Block in the Martaban basin.
The first exploration well, Manizawta-1, drilled in 2013 is dry.

In Papua New Guinea, TOTAL acquired in 2012 a 40% stake in
the PPL234 and PPL244 offshore permits, as well as 50% in the
PRL10 offshore permit and an option for 35% of the PPL338 and
PPL339 onshore permits. The results of two exploration wells
drilled on PPL244 are unsuccessful. An onshore 2D seismic survey
was also conducted in 2013.

In March 2014, TOTAL acquired a stake in Block PRL-15 (40.1%)
and an option to acquire an interest in exploration Blocks PPL-474,
PPL-475, PPL-476 and PPL-477 and in the Triceratops discovery
(PRL-39) located in the same zone. The government of Papua New
Guinea retains the right to back-in for 22.5% when the final
decision is made. In such scenario, TOTAL will hold a 31.1%
participating interest when the final decision is made. Block PRL-15
contains two major discoveries: Elk and Antelope.

In the Philippines, TOTAL has held since 2012 a 75% stake in the
SC56 license in the southern Sulu Sea. The program of operations
includes the refurbishment of older seismic lines and a new seismic
campaign that was realized at the beginning of 2013. The collected
data is currently being interpreted.

In Thailand, the Group's production in 2013 was 63 kboe/d
compared to 55 kboe/d in 2012 and 41 kboe/d in 2011. This
production comes from the Bongkot (33.33%) offshore gas and
condensates field. PTT purchases all of the natural gas and
condensates production from this field.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

- In the northern portion of the Bongkot field, new investments
are in progress to allow gas demand to be met and plateau
production to be maintained:

- phase 3J (two wellhead platforms) was launched as scheduled
in 2012;

- phase 3K (two wellhead platforms) was launched as scheduled
in 2013;

- phase 3L (two wellhead platforms) was approved in 2012 with
start-up scheduled for 2014;

- phase 3M (four wellhead platforms) was approved in March 2013
with start-up scheduled for 2015; and

- the fourth series of low-pressure compressors, which make
it possible to boost gas production, was approved in 2012
and start-up is expected in late 2014.

- The southern portion of the field (Greater Bongkot South) is also
being developed in several phases. This development is
designed to include a processing platform, a residential platform
and thirteen production platforms:

- phase 4A (six well platforms) was launched as scheduled
in 2012;

- phase 4B (four well platforms) is continuing and start-up
is scheduled for 2014; and

- development of phase 4C (three well platforms) will take place
following the other two phases.

The exploration on these licenses continues with the drilling
of several wells every year (seven in 2013).

In Vietnam, the Group no longer possesses any exploration
asset following the sale in August 2013 of its stake in offshore
Block 15-1/05 (35%).

2.1.7.5. Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)

In 2013, TOTAL’s production in the CIS was 227 kboe/d,
representing 10% of total Group production, compared
to 195 kboe/d in 2012 and 119 kboe/d in 2011.

In Azerbaijan, where TOTAL has been present since 1996 on the
Shah Deniz field (10%), production amounted to 20 kboe/d in 2013
and has been growing regularly year-on-year since 2010. TOTAL
also has a 10% stake in the South Caucasus Pipeline Company
(SCP) gas pipeline, which transports the gas produced at Shah
Deniz to the Turkish and Georgian markets. TOTAL also holds a 5%
stake in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline, which connects
Baku and the Mediterranean Sea and, among other functions,
evacuates the condensates from the gas transported from Shah Deniz.

Gas deliveries to Turkey and Georgia continued throughout 2013,
at a lower pace for Turkey due to weaker demand than initially
expected. As in 2012, however, the Azerbaijan state-owned
SOCAR continued to take greater quantities of gas than provided
for by the agreement, thus making it possible for the facilities to
operate at maximum capacity.

Following the agreements signed in 2011 regarding the sale

of additional gas volumes to Turkey and the transfer conditions

for volumes intended for the European market, the final investment
decision concerning the second phase of development at Shah
Deniz was made in December 2013. In September 2013, gas sales
agreements representing a total volume of 10 Gm*/y were signed
with European buyers. These volumes are expected to be
transported from 2021 through Turkey via the Trans Anatolian
pipeline (TANAP) within the framework of a project headed by
SOCAR, and via the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) that is expected


--- Page 29 ---

transported from 2021 through Turkey via the Trans Anatolian
pipeline (TANAP) within the framework of a project headed by
SOCAR, and via the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) that is expected
to link Turkey to Italy and in which TOTAL acquired a 10% stake
in July 2013.

With regard to the Absheron Block in the Caspian Sea, TOTAL
(40%) is the operator during the exploration phase and a joint
operating company will manage operations during the development
and production phase. A discovery and commerciality declaration
was filed in 2012 following a significant discovery in 2011.

The development plan for the field is currently being prepared.
Discussions are underway for the construction of a drilling rig

in the Caspian Sea in order to prepare for the development

of this discovery.

In Kazakhstan, TOTAL has been active since 1992 through its
16.81% stake in the North Caspian license, which covers the
Kashagan field in particular.

The Kashagan project is expected to develop the field in several
phases. Production from the first phase (300 kb/d) started on
September 11, 2013 and was first halted on September 24, 2013,
and then, after having been restarted, a second time on October 9,
2013, due to leaks detected on the gas export pipeline.
Investigations are underway in order to identify the origin of these
technical malfunctions and to allow production to resume rapidly.

In November 2012, TOTAL acquired a 75% share in the North

and South Nurmunai onshore exploration blocks. These two blocks
cover an area of 14,600 km? and are located in the southwest of
the country. A 2D seismic survey was conducted on each of these
blocks in 2013. The data is currently being interpreted and a well is
planned to be drilled in 2014.

In Russia, where TOTAL has had operations through its subsidiary
since 1991, the Group's production in 2013 was 207 kboe/d
compared to 179 kboe/d in 2012 and 105 kboe/d in 2011.

This production comes from the Kharyaga field and from TOTAL's
stake in the Russian company Novatek, which is listed in Moscow
and London.

— On the Kharyaga field (40%, operator), work related to the
development plan for Phases 3 and 4 is ongoing. This plan aims
to maintain plateau oil production above 30 kboe/d. Phase 3 is
expected to be completed in 2015 with the end of the flaring of
the associated gas.

In compliance with the strategic partnership agreement signed
in 2011 with Novatek, TOTAL continued to increase its share

in Novatek to 16.9636% as of December 31, 2013 and intends
to further increase its share up to 19.4%.

TOTAL is currently participating in two projects with Novatek:

Termokarstovoye: This onshore deposit of gas and condensates
is located in the Yamalo-Nenets district. The development

and production license for the Termokarstovoye field is owned
by ZAO Terneftegas, a joint venture between Novatek (51%)
and TOTAL (49%). The development of this field started in late
2011, with production start-up being expected for mid-2015 at
a capacity of 65 kboe/d.

Yamal LNG: The aim of this project, which has been declared

to be of national interest by Russian authorities, is to develop the
South Tambey gas and condensates field in the Yamal Peninsula
and to construct a three-train gas liquefaction plant with an LNG
production capacity of 16.5 Mt/y. The first production is expected

Upstream

late 2017. The LNG produced is intended for sale in Europe and
Asia using ice-class LNG tankers. The final investment decision
was made in December 2013. The company Yamal LNG is
Jointly-owned by Novatek (60%), TOTAL (20%) and, as of
January 2014, CNPC (20%).

In January 2014, Novatek increased its stake in the company
Severenergia (production of 100 kb/d in 2013) by acquiring ENI's
shares through the company Arcticgaz (50/50 Joint venture
between Novatek and Gazpromneft). In December 2013,
Novatek exchanged its interest held in Sibneftegas for the
entirety of Rosneft’s interests in Severenergia. Since June 2013,
Novatek has held a 50% stake in the Nortgaz field.

- In 2013, TOTAL undertook conceptual studies showing that new
technical solutions could allow a viable development of the
Shtokman field. Discussions with Gazprom for further studies are
required to find a technical, contractual and economically viable
solution for the development of the Shtokman field.

In Tajikistan, TOTAL acquired a 33.3% stake in the Bocktar Block
in the first half of 2013. The agreement represents the start of
TOTAL activity in the country. Environmental and societal studies
started at the beginning of 2014. The first phase of a seismic
campaign covering 800 km is due to start in 2014, with initial drilling
operations planned for late 2015.

2.1.7.6. Europe

In 2013, TOTAL’s production in Europe was 392 kboe/d,
representing 17% of the Group’s overall production, compared
to 427 kboe/d in 2012 and 512 kboe/d in 2011.

In Bulgaria, the Khan Asparuh license, which covers 14,220 km?
in the Black Sea, was awarded to TOTAL in 2012. In March 2013,
TOTAL sold 60% of its stake and has retained 40% of this block.
TOTAL will be the operator as of April 2014. A 2D and 3D seismic
survey was performed from June 2013 to January 2014. The data
is due to be processed and interpreted in 2014 in order to define
drilling objectives in 2015 and 2016.

In Cyprus, TOTAL has been present since February 2013 in the
deep-offshore exploration Blocks 10 (100%, operator) and 11
(100%, operator) located southwest of the country. A 3D seismic
survey was completed on Block 11 in 2013. A 2D seismic survey
on Block 10 started in February 2014.

In Denmark, TOTAL has, since 2010, owned an 80% stake in
and the operatorship of licenses 1/10 (Nordjylland) and 2/10
(Nordsjaelland, formerly Frederoskilde). These onshore licenses,

of which the shale gas potential continues to be assessed,

cover areas of 3,000 km? and 2,300 km2, respectively. Following
geoscience surveys on license 1/10 in 2011, the decision was
made to drill a well. Initially planned for 2013, this well is now
scheduled for 2014 due to additional environmental studies
requested by the local authorities. Geoscience studies are ongoing
on license 2/10 and a gravimetry acquisition was made in 2013.

In France, the Group's production in 2013 was 9 kboe/d compared
to 13 kboe/d in 2012 and 18 kboe/d in 2011. TOTAL's major assets
are the Lacq (100%) and Meillon (100%) gas fields, located in the
southwest part of the country.

On the Lacq field, which started production in 1957, a carbon
dioxide capture, injection and storage pilot was commissioned in
2010. In connection with this project, a boiler was modified to
operate in an oxy-fuel combustion environment and the COz

emitted was captured and re-injected in the depleted Rousse field.
As part of TOTAL’s Sustainable Development policy, this project
allowed the Group to assess one of the technological possibilities
for reducing CO» emissions. Most of the objectives of the
experiment having been reached, the injection of COz came to

an end in the first quarter of 2013. For additional information,

see Chapter 7. As anticipated, TOTAL ended the operations

on Lacq in October, 2013.

The sale agreements of Itteville, Vert-le-Grand, Vert-le-Petit

and La Croix Blanche assets were signed in 2011, while those

of Dommartin Lettrée, Vic-Bilh, Lacg, Lagrave and Pécorade assets
were signed in 2012. The approval of the authorities has been
obtained for the sale of all of these licenses, with the exception

of the Lacq asset, for which approval is expected to be granted

in 2014.

The Montélimar exclusive exploration license awarded to TOTAL

in 2010 to assess, in particular, the shale gas potential of the area,
was revoked by the government in October 2011. This revocation
stemmed from the law of July 13, 2011, prohibiting the exploration
and extraction of hydrocarbons by drilling followed by hydraulic
fracturing. The Group had submitted the required report to the
government in which it undertook not to use hydraulic fracturing

in light of the current prohibition. An appeal filed in December 2011
with the administrative court requesting that the judge cancel the
revocation of the license is still pending.

In Italy, TOTAL holds a stake in two exploration licenses and has
an interest in the Tempa Rossa field (60%, operator), discovered
in 1989 and located on the Gorgoglione concession (Basilicate
region). Although preparation work started in 2008, the
proceedings initiated by the Prosecutor of the Potenza Court
against Total Italia led to a freeze in the preparation work (for
additional information on this dispute, see point 4., Chapter 4,
Legal and arbitration proceedings). After resuming the preparation
work, the final investment decision was made in July 2012 and
production start-up is expected for 2016 at a capacity of 55
kboe/d. Following a call for tenders, all the civil engineering and
construction contracts were awarded in 2012 and are currently
in progress. The Gorgoglione 2 well was tested in 2012 and
confirmed the results obtained from the other wells. The drilling
of a sidetrack at well TR-2 started in November 2013.

In March 2013, TOTAL finalized an agreement to sell 25% of the
stake acquired in Tempa Rossa in 2011. This transfer, which
reduced the Group's holding from 75% to 50%, took place in
June 2013 following the approval of the Italian authorities.

In Norway, where the Group has had operations since the mid-
1960s, TOTAL has equity stakes in 104 production licenses on the
Norwegian continental shelf, 31 of which it operates. In 2013,

the Group’s production was 243 kboe/d, with 74 kboe/d from the
Greater Ekofisk Area located in the southern sector of the North
Sea, 103 kboe/d from the central and northern portions of the
North Sea and 66 kboe/d from the Haltenbanken region (in the
Norwegian Sea) and the Barents Sea. The Group's production in
Norway in 2012 was 275 kboe/d and 287 kboe/d in 2011.

The decrease in production between 2011 and 2013 was mainly
due to the decline of mature fields. Production should increase
again and reach a level of around 300 kboe/d at the horizon 2017
with the start-up of several new fields, the developments of which
have been launched (Martin Linge, Ekofisk South, Eldfisk II).

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

- In the Norwegian North Sea, the most substantial contribution to
the Group's production, which is for the most part non-operated,
comes from the Greater Ekofisk Area (e.g., Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla).

+In the southern Norwegian North Sea:

In the Greater Ekofisk Area, the Group owns a 39.9% stake

in the Ekofisk and Eldfisk fields. The Ekofisk South and Eldfisk
2 projects, each with a capacity of 70 kboe/d, were launched
in 2011. Production at Ekofisk South started in October 2013,
while start-up at Eldfisk 2 is expected in early 2015. The project
relating to the construction and installation of the new Ekofisk
accommodation and field services center platform has now
been completed and the accommodation has been operational
as of November 2013.

+In the central part of the Norwegian North Sea:

Gas production start-up at the Atla field, located on license
PL102C (40%, operator) and Beta West field (10%), a satellite
of Sleipner, took place in October 2012 and April 2011,
respectively.

The development of the Gina Krog structure (38%), formerly
known as Dagny and located to the north of Sleipner, was
approved in 2013. Production start-up is planned for 2017.

On license PLO36D (24.24%), the fast-track development of Ville
South was launched in 2011. Production start-up is expected

in the first half of 2014.

+In the northern part of the Norwegian North Sea:

The Islay field (100%, operator) was put into production in 2012.
This field extends on each side of the Norwegian/Great Britain
border and the Group's interest in the Norwegian part is 5.51%.
The Stjerne field, located on license PL104 (14.7%), and Visund
South field, located on license PL120 (7.7%), were put into
production in July 2013 and November 2012, respectively.

On license PL120 (7.7%), the fast-track development of Visund
North, which started in late 2011, made it possible to start
production on the field in November 2013.

On the Greater Hild Area (61%, operator), located in the north,
the Martin Linge development scheme was approved by the
authorities in 2012, with production start-up scheduled end 2016
at an estimated capacity of 80 kboe/d.

The Oseberg Delta phase 2 project (14.7%), located on production
licenses PL104 and PL79, was approved by the authorities in
October 2013 and production start-up is planned for 2015.

In the Norwegian Sea, the Haltenbanken area includes the
Tyrihans (23.2%), Linnorm (20%), Mikkel (7.7%) and Kristin (6%)
fields as well as the Asgard field (7.7%) and its satellites
Yttergryta (24.5%) and Morvin (6%).

The Asgard sub-sea compression project, which will increase
hydrocarbon recovery on the Asgard and Mikkel fields,

was approved by the Norwegian authorities in 2012. All the
main contracts have been awarded.

Development of the Linnorm gas field is still under study following
the lower than expected results obtained at the Onyx South
exploration well, which was drilled in 2013. It was planned to
export the gas from Linnorm to the Nyhamna onshore terminal
by installing a new pipeline (Polarled project).

The Polarled project (5.11%) was approved in December 2012.
The project consists of the installation of a 481 km long pipeline
from the Aasta Hansen field to the Nyhamna terminal and in the
expansion of the terminal.

In the Barents Sea, a project intended to improve the performance
of the Snahvit liquefaction plant (18.4%, capacity of 4.2 Mt/y)
was launched in 2012. This plant is supplied with gas from the
Snghvit, Albatross and Askeladd fields.

Several exploration wells were successfully drilled on a number of
licenses during the 2011-2013 period and revealed the presence of
hydrocarbons at the structures of Smorbukk North (PL479, 7.68%)
and Rhea (PL120, 7.68%) in 2013, Garantiana (PL554, 40%, operator)
and King Lear (PL146 and 333, 22.2%) in 2012, and Alve North
(PL127, 50%, operator) and Norvarg (PL535, 40%, operator) in 2011.
The Novarg appraisal well drilled in 2013 confirmed the presence

of gas in the structure, but the well results, which are under study

as of December 31, 2013, are below expectations.

In addition, the Group is continuing to optimize its asset portfolio
in Norway by obtaining new licenses and divesting a number of
non-strategic assets.

In the Netherlands, TOTAL has had natural gas exploration and
production operations since 1964 and currently owns twenty-four
offshore production licenses, including twenty that it operates,
and two offshore exploration licenses, E17c (16.92%) and Kic
(30%). In 2013, the Group's production was 35 kboe/d compared
to 33 kboe/d in 2012 and 38 kboe/d in 2011.

Following the acquisition of additional stakes at the end of 2013,
TOTAL now holds 50% stakes in Block K5b and 60% in Blocks
K1b/K2a and K2c. TOTAL is the operator of these three blocks.

A 3D seismic survey of several offshore permits covering an area
of 3,500 km? was conducted in 2012. The results of this
campaign are currently being interpreted.

The development project K4-Z (50%, operator) started
production in August 2013. This development project was
launched in 2011 and consists of two sub-sea wells connected
to the existing production and transport facilities.

The L4-D field (55.66%, operator) started production in 2012.

Production from the K5-CU project (49%, operator) started in
early 2011.

In Poland, at the beginning of 2012, TOTAL signed an agreement
to acquire a 49% stake in the Chelm and Werbkowice exploration
concessions in order to assess their shale gas potential. A well was
drilled and tested on the Chelm permit in 2011. The results from the
well were analyzed in 2012 and 2013. In December 2013, following
the departure of the operator, TOTAL increased its stake to 100%
and became the operator of this permit. In 2012, the Werbkowice
permit was relinquished.

In the United Kingdom, where TOTAL has had operations since
1962, the Group's production in 2013 was 105 kboe/d compared
to 106 kboe/d in 2012 and 169 kboe/d in 2011. About 90% of
production comes from operated fields located in two major zones:
the Alwyn zone in the northern North Sea, and the Elgin/Franklin
zone in the Central Graben. In 2012, the shutdown of the Elgin,
Franklin and West Franklin fields, due to a gas leak from well G4

in Elgin, severely impacted production. Production at these three
fields was resumed in March 2013.

— In the Alwyn zone (100%), the start-up of satellite fields or new
reservoir compartments made it possible to compensate in part
for the natural decline in production potential. Consequently,
wells N54 and N53 were put into production in 2012 and 2011,

Business overview
Upstream

respectively. Well N55, which was drilled in 2012 in the Brent
South West panel, is expected to be put into production in the
middle of 2014.

On the Dunbar field (100%), a new drilling campaign (Dunbar
phase IV) is due to begin during the second quarter 2014 and is
expected to include three work-overs and six new wells.

The Islay field (100%, operator) was put into production in 2012.
This field extends on each side of the Norwegian/Great Britain
border and the Group's interest in the UK portion is 94.49%.

In 2012, TOTAL finalized the divestment of its stake in the
Otter field.

In Central Graben, TOTAL increased its stake in Elgin Franklin
Oil & Gas (EFOG), a company through which it holds an interest
in the Elgin and Franklin fields (46.2%, operator), from 77.5% to
100% at the end of 2011. Production at the Elgin, Franklin and
West Franklin fields was stopped following a gas leak on the
Elgin field in March 2012. In May 2012, TOTAL confirmed that
the leak from well G4 had been successfully stopped and,

at the end of October 2012, well G4 was definitively secured by
installing five cement plugs. The enquiry led by TOTAL permitted
the clear identification of the causes of the accident and the
definition of new criteria for well integrity to allow the resumption
of production at Elgin/Franklin in total safety. Production in the
Elgin/Franklin area resumed in March 2013 following the approval
of the safety case by the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE).
Production has gradually risen to 55 kboe/d (approximately
25 kboe/d on the Group's account), representing 40% of the
production potential of these fields. In order to recover the
production level expected before the Elgin incident by 2015,

a redevelopment project envisaging the drilling of new infill wells
on Elgin and Franklin started in July 2013. Drilling work is due
to start on Elgin in early 2015.

In addition, the West Franklin Phase II development project
remains ongoing with production start-up scheduled for
mid-2014.

In addition to Alwyn and the Central Graben, a third area, west
of Shetland, is undergoing development. This area covers the
fields of Laggan and Tormore (80%, operator) and the P967
license (50%, operator), which includes the Tobermory gas
discovery. The decision to develop the Laggan and Tormore
fields was made in 2010 and production is scheduled to start in
2014 with an expected capacity of 90 kboe/d. The development
scheme includes: sub-sea production facilities; off-gas treatment
(gas and condensates) at a plant located near the Sullom Voe
terminal in the Shetland Islands, 150 km away; and a new gas
pipeline connected to the Frigg gas line (FUKA) for the export of
gas to the Saint Fergus terminal.

In early 2011, a gas and condensate discovery was made on the
Edradour East license (75%, operator) near Laggan and Tormore.
The decision to develop Edradour East using the existing
infrastructure was made at the end of 2012. The Edradour
development scheme is currently being optimized in order to
include other possible fields in the same zone. Next to the
Edradour East discovery, a second well (Spinnaker) started in
September 2013 and is currently being drilled.

TOTAL also holds a stake in three assets operated by other parties:
the Bruce (43.25%), Keith (25%), and Markham (7.35%) fields.

The Group's stakes in other fields operated by third parties
(Seymour, Alba, Armada, Maria, Moira, Mungo/Monan and Everest)
were sold off in 2012.

Nine new licenses (three in the northern North Sea, three in
Central Graben and three in West Shetland) were awarded to
TOTAL in 2012 during the twenty-seventh exploration round.

Early 2014, TOTAL acquired a 40% stake in two shale gas
exploration licenses (PEDL 139 et 140) located in the Gainsborough
Trough basin of the East Midlands, and signed an agreement that
permits the Group to acquire a 50% stake in the licence PEDL 209
located in the same area.

2.1.7.7. Middle East

In 2013, TOTAL’s production in the Middle East was 536
kboe/d, representing 23% of the Group’s production,
compared to 493 kboe/d in 2012 and 570 kboe/d in 2011.

In the United Arab Emirates, where TOTAL has had operations
since 1939, the Group's production in 2013 was 260 kboe/d
compared to 246 kboe/d in 2012 and 240 kboe/d in 2011. In 2013,
the country maintained a steady rhythm of production which led

to an increase in TOTAL's share of production. The increase

in production in 2013 was mainly due to higher production by

Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations (ADCO).

TOTAL holds a 75% stake (operator) in the Abu Al Bu Khoosh field,
a 9.5% stake in ADCO, which operates the five major onshore
fields in Abu Dhabi, and a 13.3% stake in Abu Dhabi Marine
(ADMA), which operates two offshore fields. TOTAL also has a 15%
stake in Abu Dhabi Gas Industries (GASCO), which produces NGL.
(natural gas liquids) and condensates from the associated gas
produced by ADCO as well as from the gas and condensates

and associated gases produced by ADMA. TOTAL also has a 5%
stake in Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company (ADGAS), which
processes the associated gas produced by ADMA in order to
produce LNG, NGL and condensates, and further possesses a 5%
holding in National Gas Shipping Company (NGSCO), which owns
eight LNG tankers and exports the LNG produced by ADGAS.

The ADCO license expired in January 2014 and the Abu Dhabi
authorities have issued a call for tenders for the renewal of the
license as of January 1, 2015.

The Group holds a 24.5% stake in Dolphin Energy Ltd. in
partnership with Mubadala, a company owned by the government
of Abu Dhabi, in order to market gas produced in Qatar primarily
to the United Arab Emirates.

The Group also owns 33.33% of Ruwais Fertilizer Industries
(FERTIL), which produces urea. The FERTIL 2 project was started in
July 2013 and enabled FERTIL to more than double its production
capacity to 2 Mt/y.

In Iraq, the Group's production was 7 kboe/d in 2013 compared to
6 kboe/d on average for the year 2012. TOTAL holds an 18.75%
stake in the consortium that was awarded the development and
production contract for the Halfaya field in the Missan province.
Production of Phase 1 of the project, which has a capacity of

100 kb/d, started in June 2012. Phase 2, under construction,

is expected to increase the production up to 200 kb/d by the

end of 2014. The definitive development plan, which is expected

to make it possible to achieve a plateau of 535 kb/d, was approved
by the authorities in August 2013.

In early 2013, TOTAL acquired an 80% stake and became operator
of the Baranan exploration Block (729 krr?, southeast of Soulaymaniyah,
in the Kurdistan area). A 2D seismic survey of 213 km was completed
in January 2014. The data of this seismic is expected to result in
the drilling of a first exploration well at the end of 2014

Since 2012, TOTAL has held a 35% stake in the Safen and Harir
exploration Blocks (424 km? and 705 km’, respectively, located to
the northeast of Erbil), as well as a 20% stake in the Taza Block
(505 km2, located southwest of Sulaymaniyah). During 2013, four
exploration wells were drilled and resulted in two discoveries
located in the Taza and Harir Blocks. The drilling of five new wells
is planned for 2014 on three of these four blocks. In early 2014,
TOTAL increased its stake in the Safen Block to 80% and became
the operator.

In Iran, the Group has had no production since 2010. For further
information on TOTAL and Iran, see Chapter 4 (Risk factors).

In Oman, the Group's production in 2013 was 37 kboe/d, stable
compared to 2012 and 2011. TOTAL primarily produces oil on
Block 6 (4%)"") as well as on Block 53 (2%), and it also produces
LNG through its stake in the Oman LNG (5.54%)/Qalhat LNG
(2.04%)® liquefaction plant, which has a capacity of 10.5 Mt/y.

In December 2013, TOTAL obtained the license for ultra-deep-
offshore Block 41.

In Qatar, where TOTAL has had operations since 1936, the Group's
production in 2013 was 137 kboe/d compared to 139 kboe/d in
2012 and 155 kboe/d in 2011. The Group has equity stakes in the
Al Khalij field (40%), the NFB Block (20%) in the North field, the
Qatargas 1 liquefaction plant (10%) and train 5 of Qatargas 2 (16.7%).

— In 2012, TOTAL and state-owned Qatar Petroleum signed a new
agreement to continue their partnership on the Al Khalij field for
an additional 25-year period as of 2014. TOTAL will continue to
be the operator (40%) alongside Qatar Petroleum (60%).

- The production contract for the Dolphin gas project, signed in
2001 with Qatar Petroleum, provides for the sale of 2 Bcf/d of
gas from the North Field for a 25-year period. The gas is
processed in the Dolphin plant in Ras Laffan and exported to the
United Arab Emirates through a 360 km gas pipeline.

— The production capacity of train 5 of Qatargas 2 is 8 Mt/y. TOTAL
has been a shareholder in this train since 2006. An agreement to
share the two liquefaction trains of the Qatargas 2 project (trains
4 and 5) was signed in 2011. The agreement provides for an
equal split of the physical production of the two trains as well as
of the associated operating costs and capital outlay. In addition,
TOTAL offtakes part of the LNG produced in compliance with
the contracts signed in 2006, which provide for the purchase
of 5.2 Mt/y of LNG from Qatargas 2 by the Group.

The Group became a partner in the offshore BC exploration permit
(25%) in 2011. The first exploration well is due to be drilled during
the first half of 2014.

In Syria, TOTAL has a 100% stake in the Deir Ez Zor permit, which
is operated by the joint-venture company DEZPC in which TOTAL.
and the state-owned company SPC each have a 50% share.
TOTAL also holds the Tabiyeh contract, which came into effect

in 2009. The Group had no production in the country in 2013

or in 2012 compared to 53 kboe/d in 2011. TOTAL suspended its
activities contributing to the production of hydrocarbons in Syria

in December 2011, in compliance with the European Union's
regulations regarding this country. For additional information,

see Chapter 4 (Risk Factors).

In Yemen, where TOTAL has had operations since 1987,
the Group's production was 95 kboe/d in 2013 compared to
65 Kboe/d in 2012 and 86 kboe/d in 2011.

TOTAL owns a 39.62% stake in the Yemen LNG liquefaction plant

southern coast. This plant is supplied with the gas produced on
Block 18, located near Marib in the center of the country, via a
320 km gas pipeline. The Balhaf plant suffered two rocket attacks
in December 2013 and January 2014, but production was not
impacted because one of the rockets resulted in slight damage
and the other landed in the sea. Security measures have since
been adapted due to the evolving risks.

TOTAL also has stakes in two oil basins, as the operator of Block
10 (Masila Basin, East Shabwa license, 28.57%) and as a partner
on Block 5 (Marib basin, Jannah license, 15%).

TOTAL owns stakes in five onshore exploration licenses: 40% in
Blocks 69 and 71, 50.1% in Block 70 (operator); 36% in Block 72
(operator); and 40% in Block 3 (operator).

2.2. Gas & Power

Business overview
Upstream

Gas & Power's primary objective is to contribute to the growth of
the Group by ensuring sales outlets for its current and future natural
gas reserves and production.

In order to optimize these gas resources, particularly liquefied
natural gas (LNG), Gas & Power's activities include the trading and
marketing of natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG) and electricity as well as shipping. Gas & Power also has
stakes in infrastructure companies (re-gasification terminals, natural
gas transport and storage, power plants) necessary to implement
its strategy.

In addtion, Gas & Power manages a coal business line, handling
everything from production to marketing.

2.2.1. Liquefied Natural Gas

A pioneer in the LNG industry, TOTAL today is one of the world’s
leading players") in the sector and has sound and diversified
positions both in the upstream and downstream portions of the
LNG chain. LNG development is key to the Group's strategy, with
TOTAL strengthening its positions in most major production zones
and markets.

Through its stakes in liquefaction plants?) located in Qatar, the
United Arab Emirates, Oman, Nigeria, Norway, Yemen and Angola
and its gas supply agreement with the Bontang LNG plant in
Indonesia, TOTAL markets LNG in all worldwide markets. The share
of LNG production sold by TOTAL in 2013 reached 12.3 Mt, an
increase of over 7% compared to 2012 LNG sales (11.4 Mt).

This increase was due in particular to the improved performance of
the Yemen LNG plant in 2013. The Group's forthcoming liquefaction
projects, in particular in Australia and Russia, are aimed at
increasing TOTAL's share of LNG sold over the coming years.

Gas & Power is responsible for LNG operations downstream from
liquefaction plants. It is in charge of marketing LNG on behalf of
Exploration & Production and developing the Group's LNG
downstream portfolio for its trading, marketing and transport
operations as well as re-gasification terminals.

2.2.1.1. Long-term Group LNG purchases

TOTAL acquires long-term LNG volumes most frequently from
liquefaction plants in which the Group holds a stake. These
volumes support expansion of the Group’s worldwide LNG.
portfolio.

In Nigeria, as part of the Nigeria LNG project in which the Group
has a 15% interest, TOTAL signed an LNG purchase agreement,
initially intended for deliveries to the United States and Europe, for
0.23 Mt/y over a 23-year period starting in 2006, to which an
additional 0.94 Mt/y was added when the sixth train came on
stream in 2007.

TOTAL also holds a 17% stake in the Brass LNG project involving
the ongoing study of a gas liquefaction plant with plans to construct

(1) Company data, based on upstream and downstream LNG portfolios in 2013.

two LNG trains, each with a capacity of 5 Mt/y. In 2006,

TOTAL signed a preliminary agreement with Brass LNG Ltd setting
forth the principal terms of an LNG purchase agreement for
approximately one-sixth of the plant's capacity over a 20-year
period. This purchase agreement is subject to the final investment
decision for the project.

In Norway, as part of the Snahvit project, in which the Group holds
an 18.4% stake, TOTAL signed in 2004 a purchase agreement for
0.78 Mt/y of LNG over a 15-year period primarily intended for North
America and Europe. LNG deliveries started in 2007.

In Qatar, TOTAL signed purchase agreements in 2006 for 5.2 Mt/y
of LNG from train 5 (16.7%) of Qatargas 2 over a 25-year period.
This LNG is marketed mainly in France, the United Kingdom and
North America. LNG deliveries started in 2009.

In Yemen, TOTAL signed an agreement with Yemen LNG Ltd
(39.62%) in 2005 to purchase 2 Mt/y of LNG over a 20-year period,
initially intended for delivery to the United States and Europe. LNG
deliveries started in 2009.

Since 2009, part of the volume purchased by the Group pursuant
to its long-term contracts related to the LNG projects mentioned
above has been diverted to markets in Asia.

The new LNG sources described below are expected to support
growth of the Group's LNG portfolio.

In Australia, TOTAL increased its stake in the Ichthys LNG project
in early 2013 from 24% to 30%. Launched in early 2012, this
project calls for the construction of two LNG trains, each with a
capacity of 4.2 Mt/y. In addition, TOTAL signed in 2011 an LNG
purchase agreement amounting to 0.9 Mt/y over a 15-year period.
Deliveries are expected to start in 2017.

In Russia, TOTAL owns a 20% stake in Yamal LNG, which is
overseeing a project to develop the South Tambey gas and
condensates field and build a gas liquefaction plant with three trains
supporting an LNG production of 16.5 Mt/y. The final investment
decision was made in December 2013. Concurrently, TOTAL.
signed LNG purchase agreements amounting to 4 Mt/y over a
24-year period.

In the United States, TOTAL entered into an agreement in 2012
with the South Korean national natural gas company Kogas for the
purchase of 0.7 Mt/y of LNG over a 20-year period from train 3 of
the Sabine Pass gas terminal (Louisiana). Deliveries are expected
to start in 2017. In parallel to this, TOTAL also entered into an
agreement with Sabine Pass Liquefaction LLC for the purchase of
2 Mt/y of LNG over a 20-year period from train 5 of the Sabine
Pass terminal. LNG deliveries will begin on the date on which train
5 is commissioned, which is scheduled for 2018. This agreement is
conditional on, among other things, export and construction
permits being obtained by Sabine Pass Liquefaction LLC (which
owns and operates the terminal) for the construction of train 5 and
the final investment decision for the project.

(2) Exploration & Production is in charge of the Group's natural gas liquefaction and production operations.

Business overview
Upstream

2.2.1.2. Long-term Group LNG sales

TOTAL has signed agreements for the sale of LNG from the
Group's global LNG portfolio:

In China, TOTAL signed an LNG sales agreement with China
National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC). Under this agreement,
which became effective in 2010, TOTAL supplies up to 1 Mt/y of
LNG to CNOOC over a 15-year period.

In South Korea, TOTAL signed an LNG sales agreement in 2011
with Kogas. Under this agreement, TOTAL will deliver up to 2 Mt/y
of LNG to Kogas between 2014 and 2031.

2.2.1.3. LNG shipping

With regard to LNG transport operations, TOTAL has been the
direct long-term charterer since 2004 of the Arctic Lady, a
145,000 m’ LNG vessel that ships TOTAL's share of production
from the Snohvit liquefaction plant in Norway. In 2011, TOTAL
signed a second long-term contract for the chartering of a
165,000 m’ LNG vessel, the Meridian Spirit (former Maersk
Meridian), in order to strengthen its transport capacities with
regard to its lifting commitments in Norway.

The Group is also beginning to develop a fleet. TOTAL signed a long-
term charter agreement in April 2013 in this regard with SK Shipping
and Marubeni for two 182,000 m* vessels. The vessels will serve in
fulfilling the purchase agreements of Total Gas & Power, including
commitments relating to the Ichthys LNG project in Australia and the
Sabine Pass project in the United States. These tankers, scheduled
for delivery in 2017, will be among the largest to navigate the
Panama Canal following its anticipated enlargement in 2015.

As of December 31, 2013, the Group held a 30% stake in
Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT), which focuses mainly on the design
and engineering of membrane cryogenic tanks for LNG tankers.

At year-end 2013, out of a worldwide tonnage estimated at 369 LNG
vessels", 262 active LNG vessels were equipped with membrane
tanks built under GTT licenses. TOTAL sold a share of its stake in
GTT through the initial public offering (IPO) of GTT’s shares on Euronext
Paris at the end of February 2014. Excluding the over-allotment
option, TOTAL's residual stake in GTT is 11.5%.

2.2.2. Trading

TOTAL continued in 2013 to pursue its strategy of developing
operations downstream from natural gas and LNG production.
The aim of this strategy is to optimize access for the Group's
current and future production to traditional markets (with long-term
contracts) and to markets open to international competition (with
short-term contracts and spot sales). In the context of deregulated
markets, which allow customers to more freely access suppliers, in
turn leading to marketing arrangements that are more flexible than
traditional long-term contracts, TOTAL is developing trading,
marketing and logistics businesses to offer its natural gas

and LNG production directly to customers.

In parallel, the Group has operations in electricity trading and LPG
as well as coal marketing. Furthermore, TOTAL began to market

(1) Gaztransport & Technigaz data.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

the petcoke production of the Port Arthur refinery (United States)
in 2011.

Gas & Power's trading teams are located in London, Houston,
Geneva and Singapore and conduct most of their business through
the Group’s wholly-owned subsidiaries Total Gas & Power, Total
Gas & Power North America and Total Gas & Power Asia.

2.2.2.1. Gas and electricity

TOTAL has gas and electricity trading operations in Europe and
North America with a view to selling the Group's production and
supplying its gas marketing subsidiaries in addition to supporting
other Group activities.

In Europe, TOTAL marketed 1,194 Bef (33.8 Bm’) of natural gas

in 2013, including approximately 13.8% coming from the Group's
production, compared to 1,488 Bef (42.1 Bm’) in 2012 and

1,500 Bef (42.5 Bm’) in 2011. In addition, TOTAL marketed, mainly
from external resources, 53.0 TWh of electricity in 2013 compared
to 53.3 TWh in 2012 and 24.2 TWh in 2011.

In North America, TOTAL marketed from its own production

or external resources 938 Bef (26.6 Bm) of natural gas in 2013,
compared to 1,256 Bef (36 Bm‘) in 2012 and 1,694 Bef (48 Bm*)
in 2011.

2.2.2.2. LNG

TOTAL has LNG trading operations through spot sales and
fixed-term contracts as described in section 2.2.1. Since 2009,
new purchase agreements from the Qatargas 2 and Yemen LNG
projects and new sale agreements in China, India, Japan and South
Korea have substantially developed the Group's LNG marketing
operations, particularly in Asia's most buoyant markets. This spot
and fixed-term LNG portfolio allows TOTAL to supply gas to its
main customers worldwide, while retaining a sufficient degree of
flexibility to react to market opportunities.

In 2013, TOTAL purchased 89 contractual cargoes from Qatar,
Yemen, Nigeria and Norway and 9 spot cargoes from France,
Trinidad & Tobago and Nigeria, compared to respectively 87
and 8 in 2012 and 99 and 10 in 2011.

2.2.2.3. LPG

TOTAL traded and sold approximately 5.6 Mt of LPG (butane and
propane) worldwide in 2013, compared to 6 Mt in 2012 and 5.7 Mt
in 2011. Approximately 23% of these quantities came from fields
or refineries operated by the Group. LPG trading involved the use
of 11 time-charters, representing 233 voyages in 2013, and
approximately 65 spot charters.

2.2.2.4. Coal

TOTAL marketed 8.5 Mt of coal in the international market in 2013
and 2012 compared to 7.5 Mt in 2011. More than 80% of this coal
came from South Africa. Approximately 60% of the volume was
sold in Asia, where coal is used primarily to generate electricity.
The remaining volume was marketed in Europe.


--- Page 39 ---

2.2.2.5. Petcoke

TOTAL began to market the petcoke produced by the coker at the
Port Arthur refinery in 2011. Approximately 1.2 Mt of petcoke was
sold on the international market in 2013, compared to 1.1 Mt in
2012 and 0.6 Mt in 2011, to cement plants and electricity
producers mainly in Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, China, Dominican
Republic and other Latin American countries.

2.2.3. Marketing

To unlock value from the Group’s production, TOTAL is developing
gas, electricity and coal marketing operations with end users in the
United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany. At the end of 2012,
the Group enlarged its European marketing coverage by creating
two marketing affiliates: Total Gas & Power Belgium (formerly
known as Total Gas & Power North Europe) in Belgium, and

Total Gas & Power Nederland B.V. in the Netherlands.

These two subsidiaries started their operations in 2013.

In the United Kingdom, TOTAL markets gas and electricity to the
industrial and commercial segments through its subsidiary Total
Gas & Power Ltd. In 2013, volumes of gas sold amounted to

142 Bef (4.0 Bm‘), compared to 146 Bef (4.2 Bm*) in 2012 and
162 Bef (4.6 Bm‘) in 2011. Sales of electricity totaled approximately
4.7 TWh in 2013, compared to 3.9 TWh in 2012 and 4.1 TWh

in 2011.

In France, TOTAL markets natural gas through its subsidiary

Total Energie Gaz (TEGAZ), the overall sales of which were 141 Bef
(4.0 Bm’) in 2013, compared to 176 Bef (6 Bm‘) in 2012 and

208 Bef (5.9 Bm’) in 2011. The Group also markets coal to its
French customers through its subsidiary CDF Energie, with sales
of approximately 0.81 Mt in 2013, compared to 0.97 Mt in 2012
and 1.2 Mt in 2011.

In Spain, TOTAL markets natural gas to the industrial and
commercial segments through Cepsa Gas Comercializadora,
in which it holds a 35% stake. Volumes of gas sold amounted
to 101 Bef (2.9 Bm’) in 2013 and 2012 compared to 85 Bef
(2.4 Bm’) in 2011.

In Germany, Total Energie Gas GmbH, marketing subsidiary of
TOTAL created in 2010, marketed 76 Bef (2.2 Bm*) of gas in 2013
to industrial and commercial customers, compared to 5 Bef

(0.15 Bm’) in 2012.

The Group also holds stakes in the marketing companies that are
associated with the Altamira and Hazira LNG re-gasification
terminals located in Mexico and India, respectively.

2.2.4. Gas facilities

TOTAL develops natural gas transport networks, gas storage
facilities (both liquid and gaseous) and LNG re-gasification terminals
downstream from its natural gas and LNG production.

Business overview
Upstream

2.2.4.1. Natural gas transport, natural gas
and LPG storage

In France, TOTAL, through its 29.5% stake in Géométhane, owns

natural gas storage in a salt cavern in Manosque with a capacity of
10.5 Bef (0.3 Bm*). A 7 Bef (0.2 Bm’) increase in storage capacity

is scheduled to be commissioned in 2018.

TOTAL completed in July 2013 the sale of its subsidiary TIGF
(Transport Infrastructures Gaz France) to the consortium consisting
of Snam, EDF and GIC. TIGF has gas transport activities in
southwestern France and operates a transport network of

5,000 km of gas pipeline.

In South America, TOTAL owns interests in several natural gas
transport companies in Argentina, Chile and Brazil. These assets
represent a total integrated network of approximately 9,500 km
of pipelines serving the Argentinean, Chilean and Brazilian markets
from gas-producing basins in Bolivia and Argentina, where the
Group has natural gas reserves. These natural gas transport
companies face a difficult operational and financial environment in
Argentina stemming from the absence of an increase in transport
tariffs and restrictions imposed on gas exports. However,
GasAndes, a company in which TOTAL holds a 56.5% stake,
successfully negotiated new contracts with all its customers.

In India, TOTAL holds a 50% stake in South Asian LPG Limited
(SALPG), a company that operates an underground import and
storage LPG terminal located on the east coast of the country. This
cavern, the first of its kind in India, has a storage capacity of 60 kt.
In 2013, inbound vessels transported 940 kt of LPG, compared to
950 kt in 2012 and 850 kt in 2011.

2.2.4.2. LNG re-gasification

TOTAL has entered into agreements to obtain long-term access

to LNG re-gasification capacity on the three continents that are the
largest consumers of natural gas: North America (United States
and Mexico), Europe (France and the United Kingdom), and Asia
(India). This diversified presence allows the Group to access new
liquefaction projects by becoming a long-term buyer of a portion
of the LNG produced at these plants, thereby strengthening its
LNG supply portfolio.

In France, TOTAL holds a 27.54% stake in the company Fosmax
and has, through its subsidiary Total Gas & Power Ltd., a re-gasification
capacity of 79 Bef/y (2.25 Bm*/y). The terminal received fifty-three
vessels in 2013, compared to fifty-six in 2012 and fifty-nine in 2011.

In 2011, TOTAL acquired a 9.99% stake in Dunkerque LNG in order
to develop a methane terminal project with a capacity of 459 Bef/y
(13 Bm*/y). Trade agreements have also been signed that allow
TOTAL to reserve up to 2 Bm*/y of re-gasification capacity over a
20-year period. The project is underway and commissioning of the
terminal is scheduled for the end of 2015.

In the United Kingdom, through its equity interest in the Qatargas 2
project, TOTAL holds an 8.35% stake in the South Hook LNG
re-gasification terminal with a total capacity of 742 Bef/y (21 Bm‘/y)
and an equivalent right of use to the terminal. In 2013, the terminal
re-gasified fifty-two cargoes, compared to sixty-eight in 2012 and
nearly one hundred in 2011.

Business overview
Upstream

In Mexico, TOTAL sold in 2011 its entire stake in the Altamira
re-gasification terminal, but it retained a 25% reservation of the
terminal's capacity (59 Bef/y or 1.7 Bm‘/y) through its 25% stake
in Gas del Litoral.

In the United States, TOTAL has reserved a re-gasification
capacity of approximately 353 Bef/y (10 Bm‘/y) at the Sabine Pass
terminal (Louisiana) for a 20-year period ending in 2029. In 2012,
the Sabine Pass terminal received the authorization to export LNG
from four liquefaction trains, which involves converting the re-
gasification plants into liquefaction plants. As a result, TOTAL
negotiated financial compensation with Cheniere, the terminal's
operator, in relation to the commissioning of the successive
liquefaction trains.

In India, TOTAL holds a 26% stake in the Hazira terminal, where
the natural gas re-gasification capacity was increased in 2013

to 244 Bef/y (6.9 Bm*/y). The terminal, located on the west coast
of India in the Gujarat state, is a merchant terminal with operations
that cover both LNG re-gasification and gas marketing.

Due to the Indian market's strong prospects for growth, a potential
expansion project is under study to increase the terminal's capacity
to 343 Bef/y (9.7 Bm*/y) by 2018.

2.2.5. Electricity generation

In a context of increasing global demand for electricity, TOTAL has
developed expertise in the power generation sector, especially
through cogeneration and combined-cycle power plant projects.

In Abu Dhabi, the Taweelah A1 power plant, which is owned by
Gulf Total Tractebel Power Cy (20%), combines electricity
generation and water desalination. The plant, in operation since
2008, currently has a net power generation capacity of 1,600 MW
and a water desalination capacity of 385,000 m° per day. The
plant's production is sold to Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity
Company (ADWEC) as part of a long-term agreement.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

In Nigeria, TOTAL and its partner, the state-owned Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), own interests in two
gas-fired power plant projects that are part of the government's
objectives to develop power generation and increase the share
of natural gas production for domestic use:

— the Afam VI power plant, part of the Shell Petroleum
Development Company (SPDC) joint venture in which TOTAL.
holds a 10% stake, is a 6830 MW combined-cycle power plant
that has been in operation since the end of 2010; and

— the potential development of a new 417 MW combined-cycle
power plant near the city of Obite (Niger Delta) in connection
with the OML 58 gas project (40%, operator).

In Thailand, TOTAL owns 28% of Eastern Power and Electric
Company Ltd, which operates the combined-cycle gas power plant
in Bang Bo that has a capacity of 350 MW and has been in
operation since 2003. The plant's production is sold to the
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand under a long-term
agreement.

2.2.6. Coal production

For nearly thirty years, TOTAL, through its subsidiary Total Coal
South Africa (TCSA), has produced and exported coal from South
Africa primarily to Europe and Asia. In 2013, TCSA produced
4.3 Mt of coal.

TCSA owns and operates five mines in South Africa and continues
to study other projects aimed at developing its mining resources.

The South African coal produced by TCSA or bought from
third-parties’ mines is either marketed locally or exported through
the port of Richard's Bay, in which TCSA holds a 4.8% interest.

Business overview
Refining & Chemicals

3.1. Refining & Chemicals

Refining & Chemicals includes the Group's refining, petrochemicals
and specialty chemicals businesses. The petrochemicals business
includes base petrochemicals (olefins and aromatics) and polymer
derivatives (polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene).

The specialty chemicals business includes elastomer processing,
adhesives and electroplating chemistry. The volume of its

Refining & Chemicals activities places TOTAL among the top ten
integrated chemical producers in the world").

Against the backdrop of rising worldwide demand for oil and
petrochemicals driven by non-OECD countries, the strategy

of Refining & Chemicals, in addition to the priority given to safety
and environmental protection, involves:

adapting production capacity to changes in demand in Europe
by concentrating investments on integrated platforms;

consolidating industrial means of production and the search
for opportunities for growth in the United States; and

strengthening TOTAL's positions in Asia and the Middle East,
in particular to gain access to advantaged oil and gas resources
and to benefit from growth in the markets.

This strategy is underpinned by an effort to differentiate through
the technology used and innovation found in its products and
processes, and involves pursuing asset portfolio management
to focus on core businesses.

Since 2012, Refining & Chemicals has launched a comprehensive
program to improve operational efficiency and to generate synergies
between its refining and petrochemicals activities. In particular,

four industrial priorities were set for the Refining & Chemicals activities:
safety, availability of facilities, cost controls and energy efficiency.
These action plans, combined with the development projects on

its major integrated platforms and the growth of specialty chemicals,
should improve the profitability of operations by making the most

of Refining & Petrochemicals’ assets.

In June 2013, TOTAL completed the divestment of its Fertilizers
activity (Base Chemicals) in Europe, mainly through the sale of its
shares in GPN S.A. (100%), France's leading producer of nitrogen
fertilizers, and in the Belgian company Rosier S.A. (56.86%).

3.1.1. Refining & Petrochemicals

TOTAL's refining capacity was 2,042 kb/d as of December 31,
2013, compared to 2,048 kb/d at year-end 2012 and 2,096 kb/d
at year-end 2011. The Group's worldwide refined products sales
(including trading operations) in 2013 were 3,418 kb/d, compared
to 3,403 kb/d in 2012 and 3,639 kb/d in 2011.

TOTAL has equity stakes in twenty-one refineries (including nine
that it operates), located in Europe, the United States, the French
West Indies, Africa, the Middle East and China.

Refining & Chemicals sector manages the refining operations
located in Europe (excluding the joint venture TotalErg in Italy), the
United States, the Middle East and Asia, with a capacity of 1,953
kb/d at year-end 2013 (i.e., 96% of the Group's total capacity).

(1) Based on publicly available information, production capacities at year-end 2012.

The petrochemicals businesses are located mainly in Europe,
the United States, Qatar, South Korea and Saudi Arabia. Most
of these sites are either adjacent or connected by pipelines to
Group refineries. As a result, TOTAL’s petrochemical operations.
are integrated within its refining operations.

The year 2013 saw the startup of the first production at the SATORP
refinery in Saudi Arabia. Through this project, approved in 2009, the
Group holds a stake, alongside Saudi Aramco, in one of the most
competitive refining & petrochemicals platforms in the world.

TOTAL also announced in 2013 a major investment program to
modernize the platform in Antwerp, Belgium, and a project to adapt
the petrochemicals platform in Carling, France, with the goal of
restoring competitiveness by 2016.

In 2011, TOTAL closed the sale to IPIC of its 48.83% stake in CEPSA
as part of a public takeover bid on the entire share capital of CEPSA.
With respect to refining operations, this sale concerned mainly four
Spanish refineries (Huelva, Algeciras, Tenerife, Tarragona) and, with
respect to petrochemicals operations, aromatics and their derivatives.

3.1.1.1. Europe
TOTAL is the largest refiner in Western Europe“.

In Western Europe, TOTAL's refining capacity was 1,736 kb/d
at year-end 2013, compared to 1,742 kb/d at year-end 2012 and
1,787 kb/d at year-end 2011, accounting for 85% of the Group's
overall refining capacity. The decrease in 2012 was due primarily
to the shutdown of the Rome refinery. The Group operates eight
refineries in Western Europe (one in Antwerp, Belgium, five in
France in Donges, Feyzin, Gonfreville, Grandpuits and La Méde,
one in Immingham in the United Kingdom and one in Leuna,
Germany) and owns stakes in the Schwedt refinery in Germany,
the Zeeland refinery in the Netherlands and the Trecate refinery
in Italy through its interest in TotalErg.

The Group's main petrochemical sites are located in Belgium,

in Antwerp (steam crackers, aromatics, polyethylene) and Feluy
(polyolefins, polystyrene), and in France, in Carling (steam cracker,
aromatics, polyethylene, polystyrene), Feyzin (steam cracker,
aromatics), Gonfreville (steam crackers, aromatics, styrene,
polyolefins, polystyrene) and Lavéra (steam cracker, aromatics,
polypropylene). Europe accounts for 54% of the Group's petro-
chemicals capacity, .e., 10,899 kt at year-end 2013 compared
to 11,803 kt at year-end 2012 and 11,013 kt at year-end 2011.
The decrease in 2013 was due essentially to the closure of one
steam cracker in Antwerp. The increase in 2012 was due mainly
to the acquisition of 35% of Fina Antwerp Olefins.

— In France, the Group owns five refineries and continues to adapt
its refining capacities by shifting the production emphasis to
diesel and improving operational efficiency against the backdrop
of a structural decline in the demand for petroleum products
in Europe and an increase in gasoline surpluses.

The Group has been implementing its industrial plan intended to
reconfigure the Gonfreville refinery in Normandy, France, since 2009.

(2) The divestment did not include TOTAL's interest in Grande Paroisse S.A., through which TOTAL has retained all liabilities related to the former activities of Grande Paroisse, and in

particular those related to the AZF site in Toulouse,

(3) Eamings related to the refining assets in A\rica, the French West Indies and the TotalErg joint venture are reported in the results of the Marketing & Services segment.

(4) Based on publicly available information, 2012 refining capacities and quantities sold.

The project is intended to upgrade the refinery and shift the
production emphasis to diesel. For this purpose, the investments
resulted in reducing the annual distillation capacity to 12 Mt

from 16 Mt, upsizing the hydrocracker unit for heavy diesel cuts
and improving energy efficiency by lowering carbon dioxide
emissions. Most of the new configuration was rolled out at

the beginning of 2013 after a major complete shutdown of the
refinery. The complete project is expected to be finalized by
mid-2014 with the startup of a new diesel desulfurization unit.

In parallel, the project to modernize the Normandy platform's
petrochemical operations was completed in early 2012. This
project improved the energy efficiency of the steam cracker
and the high-density polyethylene unit.

In petrochemicals, the Group announced in September 2013

an investment plan for the Carling platform in Lorraine, France,
to adapt its capacity and restore its competitiveness. The project
provides for the development of new hydrocarbon resin and
polymer production activities and the shutdown of the steam
cracking activity in the second half of 2015.

In Belgium, the Group announced in May 2013 the launch of
a major project to modernize its Antwerp platform. This project
consists of two parts:

- the construction of new conversion units in response to the
shift in demand towards lighter oil products with a very low
sulfur content; and

- the construction of a new unit to convert the gases recovered
from the refining process into raw materials for petrochemical
units.

The modernization plan also provides for the shutdown of two
of the site’s oldest production units: one steam cracker in 2013,
and a polyethylene production line by the end of 2014.

TOTAL built a new unit in Feluy that is starting up in 2014 in order
to produce latest-generation expansible polystyrene for the fast-
growing insulation market.

Moreover, in 2012, TOTAL acquired 35% of Fina Antwerp Olefins,
Europe's second largest base petrochemicals (monomers)
production plant“.

— Inthe United Kingdom, the commissioning in 2011 of the
hydrodesulfurization (HDS) unit at the Lindsey refinery allowed
the refinery to increase its crude processing flexibility (up to 70%
of high-sulfur crudes, compared to 10% previously) and its
low-sulfur diesel production.

In 2013, TOTAL decided to shut down its 70 kt/year polystyrene
production site at Stalybridge, while continuing its commercial
activity for polymers in the United Kingdom.

— In Italy, TotalErg (49%) holds a 24.45% stake in the Trecate
refinery. The Rome refinery, which was wholly-owned by TotalErg,
was turned into a depot in 2012.

3.1.1.2. North America

The Group's main sites are located in Texas, in Port Arthur (refinery,
steam cracker), Bayport (polyethylene) and La Porte (polypropylene),
and in Louisiana, in Carville (styrene, polystyrene).

In 2011, TOTAL completed a program to upgrade the Port Arthur
refinery that included the construction of a desulfurization unit, a
vacuum distillation unit, a deep-conversion unit (or coker) and other
associated units. This modernization allows the refinery to process
more heavy and high-sulfur crudes and to increase production of
lighter products, in particular low-sulfur distillates.

TOTAL and BASF purchased in 2011 Shell's stakes in Sabina, a
butane processing plant, which they transferred to BTP (40%), their
joint subsidiary that owns the Port Arthur steam cracker. This new
structure increases synergies between the refinery and the steam
cracker, which are located on the same site in Port Arthur.

Furthermore, as a result of the investment made to adapt its furnaces,
the BTP cracker has, since April 2013, been able to produce almost
40% of its ethylene from ethane and 40% from butane and propane,
which allows it to benefit from favorable market conditions in the
United States. The ongoing construction of a new ethane-burning
furnace will increase the steam cracker’s production capacity by
almost 15% in 2014.

3.1.1.3. Asia and the Middle East

TOTAL is continuing to expand in growth areas and is developing
sites in countries with favorable access to raw materials.

In Saudi Arabia, the joint venture Saudi Aramco Total Refining and
Petrochemical Company (SATORP) was created in 2008 by TOTAL
(37.5%) and Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabian Oil Company, 62.5%) in
order to build a 400 kb/d refinery in Jubail. Saudi Aramco plans to
retain a 37.5% interest, with the remaining 25% expected to be
listed on the Saudi stock exchange. Most of the different units of
SATORP were gradually commissioned in 2013 and the commercial
exports of petroleum products started in September 2013. All the
refining and petrochemicals units should be operational by the end
of first quarter 2014. Production is expected to reach full capacity
around mid-2014.

The configuration of this refinery is designed for processing

heavy crudes produced in Saudi Arabia and selling fuels and other
light products that meet strict specifications and that are mainly
intended for export. The refinery is also integrated with the
petrochemical units: a 700 kt/y paraxylene unit, a 200 kt/y
propylene unit, and a 140 kt/y benzene unit.

In China, TOTAL holds a 22.4% stake in WEPEC, a company
that operates a refinery located in Dalian and that also produces
polypropylene.

The Group is also active through its polystyrene plant in Foshan
(Guangzhou region), the capacity of which doubled to 200 kt/y
at the beginning of 2011. A new polystyrene compounds unit
started up on this site in the first quarter of 2013. TOTAL began
the construction of a new 200 kt/y polystyrene plant in Ningbo
in the Shanghai region, with production scheduled to start up
in the second half of 2014.

In South Korea, TOTAL holds a 50% stake in Samsung Total
Petrochemicals Co., Ltd., which operates the petrochemical site
located in Daesan (condensate splitter, steam cracker, styrene,
paraxylene, polyolefins). The joint venture completed in mid-2011
the first debottlenecking phase of the units at the Daesan site in
order to bring them to full capacity. This first phase included
increasing the capacity of the steam cracker to 1,000 kt/y and
the polyolefin units to 1,150 kt/y. A second phase took place

in September 2012 and involved increasing the capacity of the
paraxylene unit to 700 kt/y.

In addition, to keep up with growth in the Asian markets, two.
major projects are under construction for planned start-up in 2014:
anew 240 kt/y EVA" unit and a new aromatic unit with a capacity
of 1.5 Mt/y of paraxylene and benzene, the raw material of which
will be supplied by a new condensate splitter that will also produce
kerosene (1.5 Mt/y) and diesel (1.0 Mt/y). As a result, the site's
paraxylene production capacity will be increased to 1.8 Mt/y.
Together, these projects are expected to double the production
capacity of the site between 2011 and 2015.

3.1.1.4. Crude oil refining capacity

including the linear low-density polyethylene plant with a capacity
of 450 kt/y operated by Qatofin in Messaied and a new 300 kt/y
low-density polyethylene line operated by Qapco, which started

up in 2012.

TOTAL holds a 10% stake in the Ras Laffan condensate refinery,
which has a capacity of 146 kb/d. Plans to double the refinery’s
capacity were approved in April 2013 and are expected to be
completed in 2016. The project also includes the construction

of a new diesel hydrogenation unit scheduled to come on-stream
in 2014.

3.1.1.8. Development of new avenues for the
production of fuels and polymers

In addition to optimizing existing processes, TOTAL is exploring new
ways for valorizing carbon resources, conventional or otherwise
(natural gas, coal, biomass, waste). A number of innovative projects
are being examined that entail defining access to the resource (nature,
location, supply method, transport), the nature of the molecules
and target markets (fuels, lubricants, petrochemicals, specialty
chemicals), and the most appropriate, efficient and environmentally-
friendly conversion processes.

3.1.1.8.1. Natural gas to liquids

TOTAL continues to develop its know-how in the conversion of
natural gas to fuel. For large-scale projects (more than 10 kboe/d),
TOTAL is consolidating its know-how in the most efficient conversion
processes and is contributing to the development of innovative
solutions, in particular by developing new Fischer-Tropsch catalysts.
TOTAL is also conducting research into small-scale concepts,
such as torched gas solutions.

3.1.1.8.2. Coal to polymers

TOTAL has developed know-how in the various processes used to
convert coal into higher value products by gasification. These efforts
allow a better understanding of the technological issues specific to
each process, such as Fischer-Tropsch, methanol, di-methyl ether
(DME) and methane, particularly in terms of energy optimization,
water consumption and carbon capture.

TOTAL is studying a coal to olefin (CTO) conversion project in
partnership with the China Power Investment utility company that
would be located in Inner Mongolia (China). This 800 kt/y olefins project
would use the innovative Methanol-to-Olefins process (MTO/OCP),
which has been successfully tested in 2013 on a demonstration

unit at Feluy, Belgium. Following the approval from the Chinese
authorities in November 2013, a detailed study has been launched.

In parallel, TOTAL is pursuing a program to develop new carbon
capture and storage technologies in order to reduce the environmental
footprint of the Group's industrial projects based on fossil energy.
In partnership with the IFP Energies Nouvelles (French Institute for

Oil and Alternative Energies), TOTAL is involved in an R&D program
related to chemical looping combustion, an innovative process.

to burn solid and gas feedstock that includes carbon capture at

a very low energy cost. In 2010, this partnership resulted in the
construction of a pilot at the Solaize site in France.

3.1.1.8.3. Biomass to polymers

TOTAL is involved in the development of processes dedicated or
related to the conversion of biomass to polymers. The main area
of focus is the development of a polylactic acid (PLA) production
technology through Futerro, a joint venture with Galactic, a lactic
acid producer, as well as developing a technology for dehydration
of bio-alcohols into olefins (monomers for the manufacture of large
conventional polymers), in collaboration with IFPen/Axens.

3.1.1.8.4. Biomass to fuels

TOTAL is a member of the BioTFuel consortium, the objective
of which is to develop a chain for converting lignocellulose into
fungible, sulfur-free liquid products through gasification and
synthesis using the Fischer-Tropsch process. To benefit from
economies of scale, it is envisaged to convert lignocellulosic
feedstock into a blend with fossil resources. This development
involves an initial pilot demonstration phase.

In 2013, the Group incorporated:

- In gasoline, 549 kt of ethanol") at its European refineries and
several oil depots, compared to 531 kt in 2012 and 494 kt
in 2011 ; and

- Indiesel, 1,951 kt of VOME™’ at its European refineries and several
oil depots®, compared to 1,927 kt in 2012 and 1,859 kt in 20118.

3.1.2. Specialty Chemicals

The specialty chemicals businesses include elastomer processing
(Hutchinson), adhesives (Bostik) and electroplating chemistry
(Atotech). They serve the automotive, construction, electronics,
aerospace and convenience goods markets, for which marketing,
innovation and customer service are key drivers. TOTAL markets
specialty products in more than sixty countries and intends to
develop by combining organic growth and targeted acquisitions.
This development is focused on high-growth markets and the
marketing of innovative products with high added value that
meet the Group's Sustainable Development approach.

In 2013, consolidated worldwide sales of specialty chemicals
activities (excluding Resins) totaled €5.7 billion, stable compared
to 2012 and up 7% compared to 2011.

The Cray Valley coating resins and Sartomer photocure resins
businesses were divested in 2011. However, the structural and
hydrocarbon resins business lines were kept and have been
incorporated into the Polymer division.

3.1.3.1. Elastomer processing

Hutchinson manufactures and markets products derived from
elastomer processing that are principally intended for the automotive,
aerospace and defense industries.

Among the industry's leaders worldwide, Hutchinson provides
its customers with innovative solutions in the areas of fluid transfer,
air and fluid seals, anti-vibration, sound and thermal insulation,
and transmission and mobility.

Hutchinson has eighty-four production sites worldwide, including
fifty-six in Europe, seventeen in North America, six in Asia, four in
South America and one in Africa.

Hutchinson’s sales in 2013 were €3.28 billion, up 3% compared
to 2012. Despite the difficulties experienced by the European
automotive sector, sales for the automotive business increased by
5% due to the growth of the Asian and North American markets
and increased market share in Europe. On the industrial markets,
sales increased by 1%, mainly due to the increased sales on the
civil aerospace that offset contraction of the defense markets.

To strengthen its position in the aerospace industry, Hutchinson
acquired Kaefer in 2011, a German company specializing in aircraft
interior equipment (e.g., insulation, ventilation ducts) and the Canadian
company Marquez specializing in air-conditioning circuits at the end
of 2012. In the automotive sector, Hutchinson acquired Keum-Ah

in 2011, a South Korean company specializing in fluid transfer systems.
Hutchinson closed the Oyartzun production plant in Spain at the
end of 2012.

In July 2013, Hutchinson divested 30% of its automobile brake
hose business in Spain (Palamos) through the creation of a joint
venture with Japanese company Nichirin, one of the world leaders
in this segment. Elsewhere, in July 2013, Hutchinson acquired
Gasket International, a company based in Italy and China, which
specializes in the production of sealing parts for valves for the oil
and gas industry.

Hutchinson continues to develop in strong growth potential
markets and among the most dynamic and strongest customers.
Hutchinson continuously strives to innovate, offering its customers
high-performance materials and high-value added solutions
capable of performing the most demanding functions.

Sales were €1.51 billion in 2013, a decrease of 3% compared to 2012.

Bostik continues to strengthen its technological positions in the
construction and industrial sectors, pursue its program for
differentiation focused mainly on an offering of innovative bonding
solutions, continue its expansion in high-growth countries and
improve its operational performance.

Consequently, following the start-up of a new production unit in
Egypt and the opening of a new technology center for Asia in
Shanghai in 2012, Bostik inaugurated in 2013 a new production
unit in Changshu, China, which will ultimately become Bostik’s
largest production plant in the world.

Bostik continued to rationalize its industrial base in 2013 with
the shutdown of production in Dublin, Ireland, Barcelona, Spain,
Lisbon, Portugal and Zhuhai, China. A workshop was also shut

Business overview y)
Refining & Chemicals

Atotech has seventeen production sites worldwide, including seven in
Asia, six in Europe, three in North America and one in South America.

Sales totaled €0.89 billion in 2013, a decrease of 8% compared to
2012, mainly due to the slump in the sales of electroplating equipment
and the divestment of a commodities reselling activities (anodes).

In 2013, Atotech successfully continued to pursue its strategy
designed to differentiate its products through a comprehensive
service provided to its customers in terms of equipment,
processes, design and chemical products and through the
development of green, innovative technologies to reduce the
environmental footprint. This strategy relies on global coverage
provided by its technical centers located near customers.

In order to strengthen its position in the electronics market,

Atotech started up a new production unit in 2011 aimed at the
semiconductors market in Neuruppin (Germany) and acquired
adhesive technologies (molecular interfaces) in the nanotechnology
sector in the United States. In addition, a new equipment production
site is expected to be opened in China in the third quarter of 2014.

Atotech intends to continue to develop in Asia, which already
represents approximately 65% of its global sales.

Trading operates extensively on physical and derivatives markets, both organized and over the counter. In connection with its trading
activities, TOTAL, like most other oil companies, uses derivative energy instruments (futures, forwards, swaps and options) to adjust its
exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil and refined products. These transactions are entered into with various counterparties.

For additional information concerning derivatives transactions by Trading & Shipping, see Notes 30 (Financial instruments related to
commodity contracts) and 31 (Market risks) to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Chapter 10, point 7).

All of TOTAL's trading activities are subject to strict internal controls and trading limits.

In 2013, the global oil market was balanced and oil prices fell
slightly from 2012. Crude oil prices were subject to increased
backwardation"). Crude oil prices in North America benefited from
a significant reduction in the price spread between the crude markers
WTI (West Texas Intermediate, confined to the central United States

and subject to a local production surplus) and Dated Brent (delivered
in the North Sea and accessible to the international crude market).
Freight rates decreased in 2013 due to an ever-growing availability

in charter capacities.

In 2013, Trading’s activities were affected by the global economic
environment described below. After a slow-down worldwide during
the first quarter of 2013, economic growth began a gradual recovery,
pulling the Eurozone out of six quarters of recession by the second
quarter of 2013. This slight improvement came to a halt in the third
quarter under the impact of significant exchange rate fluctuations
in emerging markets and the budget debate in the United States.

In this context, growth in the demand for oil nevertheless remained
constant (+1.1 Mb/d®!, nearly identical to 2012). Diesel fuel and
gasoline led this growth (+0.4 Mb/d each), while demand for fuel

oil contracted (-0.2 Mb/d) due to efficiency gains among shipowners
and reduced demand from Japanese power generators. The
increase in oil demand was focused in Asia and the Middle East
(+0.6 Mb/d in total), while demand in Europe decreased (-0.2 Mb/d).

Estimated global oil supplies stagnated in 2013, increasing by only
+0.2 Mb/d after jumping +2.7 Mb/d in 2012. Non-OPEC production
grew by approximately +1.0 Mb/d, increasing by +1.2 Mb/d in
North America (United States and Canada), which offset declining
or stagnating output in other countries.

Overall OPEC production decreased by 1.0 Mb/d, with crude oil
production decreasing by 1.1 Mb/d. Significant crude oil production
capacity was made unavailable (more than 3 Mb/d in the third
quarter, compared to approximately 2 Mb/d at the start of 2013),
thereby limiting the supply from certain countries due to, among
other reasons, sanctions imposed on Iran, conflicts in Libya and
acts of sabotage in Nigeria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia increased its
production during the course of 2013 to help maintain market
equilibrium, which sharply reduced OPEC's excess capacity.

The reverse situation is described as “contango”
(2) TOTAL estimates,

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013


--- Page 49 ---

The differential between supply and demand narrowed in 2013,
dropping from +1.2 Mb/d in 2012 to +0.3 Mb/d due to the increase
in demand and flat supply, thereby slowing the anticipated increase
in global oil stocks.

Crude oil prices started 2013 on an upward trend, with Dated Brent
hitting a high of $119.03/b on February 8. Prices then steadily fell,
driven downward by the deteriorating economic environment in
Europe and an oversupplied crude market, to reach a low of
$96.83/b on April 17. The price of Dated Brent stabilized during

the second quarter of 2013 at a level between $100/b and $105/b.
Market tensions in the third quarter drove the price of Dated

Brent back upward ($117.12/b on September 6), before prices
subsequently leveled off below $110/b.

On the futures market, the backwardation of ICE Brent contract
prices increased as a result of the same supply tensions that lifted
spot (Dated Brent) prices in the first quarter of 2013. This
backwardation decreased considerably during the second quarter
with the seasonal drop in demand for crude oil, mainly due to
planned refinery shutdowns for maintenance. The post-maintenance
resumption of refining activity and new supply tensions drove
backwardation to a maximum of $11/b toward the end of

August before it decreased again late in the year.

The year 2013 was also marked by the narrowing of the crude
price spread between WTI and Dated Brent. Extension of the
Seaway pipeline from Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Texas coast

of the Gulf of Mexico between January and April, along with the
commissioning of additional pipelines from the Permian Basin in
western Texas to the Gulf of Mexico in the second quarter, helped

Refining & Chemicals

to restore balance in the central U.S. market. The crude price
spread between WTI and Dated Brent consequently fell from around
$20/b in January/February 2013 to around $4/b in July/August.
This price spread widened once again beginning in the third
quarter with the continuing rapid increase in domestic U.S. crude
production and only moderate increases in demand.

While global refining capacity grew by approximately +0.9 Mb/d in
2013, crude throughputs increased by only approximately +0.4 Mb/d,
held back by weaker refining margins. The weak margins reflect the
growing surplus in global refining capacity. Asian refiners dominated
the increases in refinery throughputs and capacity (+0.6 Mb/d and
+1.0 Mb/d, respectively).

3.2.2. Shipping

The transportation of crude oil and refined products necessary for
the activities of the Group is arranged by Shipping. These requirements
are fulfilled through balanced use of the spot and time-charter markets.
A rigorous safety policy is applied by Shipping mainly through a strict
selection of chartered vessels. Like a certain number of other oil
companies and shipowners, the Group uses freight rate derivative
contracts to adjust its exposure to freight rate fluctuations.

In 2013, Trading & Shipping chartered more than 3,000 voyages to
transport approximately 115 Mt of crude oil and refined products. As
of December 31, 2013, Trading & Shipping employed a fleet of forty-
six vessels, none of which were single-hulled, that were chartered
under long-term or medium-term agreements (including seven LPG
carriers). The fleet has an average age of approximately five years.

(a) VLCC: Very Large Crude Carrier. BITR: Baltic International Tanker Routes.

The first nine months of 2013 were a difficult period for the oil
shipping sector, particularly for larger crude tankers. Conditions
were more favorable, meanwhile, for petroleum product carriers.
At the same time, marine bunker prices remained high with a
knock-on effect on transport costs.

Global demand for the transport of crude oil stabilized in 2013 after
posting an increase of more than 5% among larger-sized vessels in
2012. This situation was attributable mainly to a decrease in North
American imports due to an increase in local production in that
region. This was partially offset by an increase in demand in Asia,
particularly in China, which has been diversifying its supply from
more distant sources (South America, Western Africa). The increase
in tonnage continued to be strong, weakening the balance between

(1) MR: Medium Range - 50,000 DWT (deadweight tonnage}; LR2: Long Range ~ 110,000 DWT.

supply and demand to historic levels. This led to record lows in
VLCC freight rates through the end of the third quarter. The closing
months of 2013 saw a reversal in crude oil freight rates, which
reached a record annual level due to especially strong ongoing
demand for deliveries to Asia from the Atlantic Basin.

The situation in the petroleum product shipping market was better
overall than in the crude oil shipping market. Demand for the transport
of petroleum products was particularly strong, with arbitrage in favor
of longer routes, especially to Asia (notably the flow of naphtha from
Europe to Asia on large carriers). Starting in early 2013, freight rates
induced ship owners to resume ordering petroleum product tankers
(MR and LR2"), a sector in which growth had moderated.

4.1.7. Product and services developments

TOTAL continued in 2013 its technical and R&D partnerships in
Formula 1 with Renault Sport F1, in the WRC with Citroén Racing
and in endurance racing with Toyota. The purpose of these
partnerships is to demonstrate TOTAL’s technical excellence in
the formulation of fuels and lubricants under extreme conditions
and restrictions on fuel consumption. The TOTAL brand was.
associated with two Formula 1 world titles in 2013.

TOTAL continued its Clean Energy Partnership (CEP) in Germany,
which is centered on hydrogen distribution. TOTAL currently has
five demonstration stations for hydrogen distribution in Germany.
Anew hydrogen station is scheduled to open near the new airport
in Berlin during the first half of 2014. TOTAL signed an agreement
with Daimler in 2013 for the joint development of eight new stations
under the CEP. Along with its partners in the “H2 Mobility” initiative,
TOTAL also signed a preliminary agreement covering the

implementation of an action plan targeting construction of a network
of hydrogen stations throughout Germany. It is anticipated that
this network will have approximately 400 stations by 2023 (subject
to deployment of more than 250,000 fuel-cell electric vehicles).

TOTAL has approximately twenty prototype electric vehicle fueling
stations in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and France. The
demonstration program of the distribution of electricity (fast charge)
intended for electric vehicles continued at these stations in 2013.

4.2. New Energies

Business overview
Marketing & Services

TOTAL undertook within its European subsidiaries additional studies
in 2013 into the potential of LNG as a fuel for heavy duty vehicles.
The development of at least two pilot stations is scheduled for 2014.

In response to global market developments and looking ahead to future
growth opportunities, TOTAL developed and tested five new energy
optimization offerings among consumers and Corporate customers in
2013 based on multi-energy production (fuels, gas, photovoltaic, wood)
and energy efficiency services (audit, monitoring, management).

New Energies is developing renewable energies that will, in
combination with hydrocarbons, help establish a more diversified
energy mix while also generating lower COz emissions. In meeting
this objective, TOTAL is focusing on two main development axes:
solar energy, which benefits from unlimited energetic resources,
particularly in certain geographical zones where the Group has.

a Significant presence, and the transformation of biomass through
use of biotechnology, which aims to develop new biosourced
product solutions for transport and chemicals. The Group keeps
an active watch on other renewable energies not classified as
priority areas for development at this time.

4.2.1. Solar energy

TOTAL is developing upstream operations through industrial
production and downstream marketing activities in the photovoltaic
sector based on crystalline silicon technology. The Group is also
pursuing R&D in this field through several industrial and academic
partnerships.

The economic context in this sector is currently stabilizing following
two years of sharp price decreases that drove many players out of
the market. Competitiveness in photovoltaic solar energy has
improved and significant technical achievements have supported
the emergence for the first time of markets that are profitable
without subsidization.

4.2.1.1. SunPower

As of December 31, 2013, TOTAL held a 64.65% stake in SunPower,
aU.S. company listed on NASDAQ (NASDAQ: SPWR) and based
in San José, California. SunPower is an integrated player that
designs, manufactures and supplies the highest-efficiency solar
panels in the market. For additional information, see chapter 7,
point 2., energy efficiency. SunPower is active throughout the solar
chain, from photovoltaic cell production based on crystalline silicon
to the design and construction of large turnkey power plants,

as well as the commercialization of solar solutions for residential
and commercial markets.

Upstream, SunPower manufactures all of its cells in Asia (Philippines,
Malaysia) and has a total production capacity of 1,300 MW/y.

The company is continuing to adjust its production capacity while
maintaining its technological leadership through a significant R&D
program. The cells are assembled into modules, or solar panels,

in plants located in Asia, the United States, Mexico, Europe and
South Africa. A 350 MW expansion in capacity was approved

at the end of 2013 for start-up of production in 2015.

Downstream, SunPower markets its panels worldwide for applications
ranging from residential roof tiles to large solar power plants.

In the United States, SunPower completed the construction in

2013 of the California Valley Solar Ranch, solar power plant (CVSR,
314 MWp), and started up the plant at the world's largest solar
farm, Solar Star (709 MWp), sold to NRG Energy and MidAmerican,
respectively, at the time of the investment decision.

TOTAL and SunPower also launched new solar power plant projects
in Chile and South Africa in 2013. In Chile, SunPower is both
supplying panels for and constructing the Salvador plant (70 MWp)
in cooperation with TOTAL. The project, in which TOTAL is a 20%
shareholder, is 70% financed by OPIC, the U.S. development finance
institution. The electricity produced will be sold on the spot market
and used to power the Chilean electricity grid.

In South Africa, subsequent to a tender offer, TOTAL and SunPower
were selected by the South African government to build a free-
standing 86 MWp solar power plant. TOTAL is a 27% shareholder
in the project, while SunPower will supply the solar panels and
construct the plant, which will sell the electricity produced under
an energy purchase agreement.

In Asia, SunPower was selected in September 2013 to become
the main supplier of panels (69 MWp) to the largest solar power
plant in Japan, located in the Aomori Prefecture.

4.2.1.2. Other solar assets

The Shams 1 solar power plant (109 MW of parabolic concentrated
solar power) in Abu Dhabi was commissioned in September 2013
with production being sold to the Abu Dhabi Water Electricity
Company (ADWEC). TOTAL (20%) will take part in its operation

for a 25-year period.

TOTAL owns a 50% interest in the French company Sunzil, which
markets photovoltaic panels overseas.

Elsewhere, the Group is continuing initiatives to display solar
application solutions as part of decentralized rural electrification
projects in a number of countries, including in South Africa

via Kwazulu Energy Services Company (KES), in which TOTAL
holds a 35% stake.

Photovoltech, a Belgian company (50%) specialized in manufacturing
multicrystalline photovoltaic cells, was put into liquidation in
October 2013 after having ceased operations in late 2012.

4.2.1.3. New solar technologies

In order to strengthen its technological leadership in the crystalline
silicon field, and in addition to its cooperation with SunPower in
the R&D field, New Energies partners with leading laboratories
and research institutes in France and abroad. The aim of these
partnerships is to optimize the photovoltaic solar chain (silicon,
wafers, cells, modules and systems) by cutting production costs
and multiplying its applications, while increasing the efficiency

of the components in terms of electric conversion.

In this regard, TOTAL is working with the IMEC (Interuniversity
MicroElectronics Center — Belgium) and the Ecole Polytechnique’s
LPICM (Laboratory of physics of interfaces and thin layers), which
specializes in plasma-deposition processes at low temperatures.
Further to this partnership, TOTAL and, principally, the CNRS, the
Ecole Polytechnique and EDF signed in October 2013 a funding
agreement with the National Research Agency (ANR) concerning
the IPVF (Institut Photovoltaique d’lle-de-France), which, with its
team of nearly 200 researchers, aims to eventually become one
of the main centers worldwide conducting research into latest-
generation photovoltaic devices.

With respect to electricity storage, TOTAL is continuing its R&D
program with renowned institutions such as the Massachusetts.
Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States to develop
anew battery technology, and is investing in start-ups including
Ambri (11%), founded at MIT, as well as Lightsail and Enervault,
also based in the United States.

4.2.2. Biotechnologies and
the conversion of biomass

TOTAL is exploring a number of opportunities for developing
biomass depending on its nature, accessibility and sustainability.
The Group's objective is to sell high-performance molecules in
targeted markets (fuel, lubricants, special polymers, chemicals,
etc.). The focus of New Energies is on the biochemical conversion
process for this biomass.

Amyris Inc., a U.S. company listed on NASDAQ (NASDAQ: AMRS),
was identified for TOTAL's first significant equity investment in
biotechnology. At year-end 2013, TOTAL held 17.9% of the company.
A collaboration agreement with Amyris has been signed covering
research (including the formation of a shared research team),
development, production and marketing activities relating to

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

biosourced molecules. Amyris owns a cutting-edge industrial
synthetic biological platform designed to create and optimize
micro-organisms that can convert sugars into molecules of interest
through fermentation. Amyris also owns a research laboratory and
pilot units in California and Brazil. In early 2013, Amyris started up
an industrial production site for farnesene, which is used in the
production of renewable diesel and kerosene, in Brotas, in the state
of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

At the end of 2013, TOTAL and Amyris created Total Amyris
Biosolutions, a 50/50 joint venture that holds the exclusive rights
and intellectual property in relation to farnesene.

In addition, the Group continues to develop a global network of
R&D partnerships in technology segments that are complementary
to Amyris’ platform (deconstruction of lignocellulose, synthetic
biology, metabolism engineering), including with Joint BioEnergy
Institute (JBEI, United States), Novogy (United States), Gevo Inc.
(NASDAQ: GEVO, United States), the University of Wageningen
(Netherlands) and the Toulouse White Biotechnology consortium

(TWB) (France).

The Group is also studying the longer-term potential for developing
a cost-effective phototrophic process for producing biomolecules
through the bio-engineering of microalgae and associated processes.
An exploratory research agreement was signed with the Grenoble
CEA (Atomic and Alternative Energies Commission) in late 2013,
and two development projects are underway with the AlgaePark
consortium in the Netherlands.

4.2.3. Other renewable energies

In the field of wind power, TOTAL owns a 12 MW wind farm in Mardyck
(near Dunkirk, France), which was commissioned in 2003.

In marine energy, TOTAL holds a 26.7% share in Scotrenewables
Tidal Power, located in the Orkney Islands in Scotland. Tests on
a 250 kW prototype have been successfully completed. A 2 MW
commercial model is being developed.

Marketing & Services 1,365 1,301 1,834
Corporate 122 80 135
Total 25,922 22,943 24,541

Organic capital expenditure, including net investment in equity
affiliates and non-consolidated subsidiaries, amounted to $28.3
billion in 2013 (€21.3 billion), compared with $23.8 billion in 2012
(€18.5 billion). This increase was due to a rise in investments
related to a large number of Upstream projects under development.

In 2013, in the Upstream segment, capital expenditure was mainly
intended for the development of new hydrocarbon production
facilities and exploration operations.Development expenditure was
devoted primarily to the following projects: GLNG and Ichthys in
Australia, Surmont and Fort Hills in Canada, the Ekofisk and Eldfisk
areas in Norway, the Laggan Tormore projects in the United Kingdom,
Moho North in Congo, CLOV in Angola, Ofon Il and Egina in Nigeria
and Yamal in Russia.

In the Refining & Chemicals segment, capital expenditure was
devoted to the maintenance of facilities and safety and to projects
to increase the production of lighter products, add desulphurization
capacities, adapt the refining base to new specifications and improve
energy efficiency. 2013 was marked by the announcement of the
upgrading project at the Antwerp refinery in Belgium and a project
to adapt the petrochemicals platform in Carling, France, and by

the start of production at the SATORP refinery in Saudi Arabia.

In the Marketing & Services segment, capital expenditure in 2013
was mainly dedicated to the network, logistics and specialty
production and storage facilities.

5.2. Major investments anticipated

While continuing to develop its major Exploration & Production
projects in 2013, the Group also strengthened its prospects beyond
2017 by acquiring high-potential assets, particularly in Brazil, and by
extending its acreage through licenses obtained in promising
exploration areas. Thus, acquisitions were $4.5 billion (€3.4 billion),
comprised essentially of the acquisition of a stake in the Libra field
in Brazil, an additional 6% stake in the Ichthys project in Australia, an
additional 1.6% stake in Novatek"’, the carry agreement in the Utica
shale gas and condensates field in the United States and the bonus
for exploration licenses in South Africa, Mozambique and Brazil.

Total investment (including acquisitions and changes in non-current
loans) therefore increased from $27.8 billion (€21.7 billion) in 2012
to $32.8 billion (€24.7 billion) in 2013.

In 2013, asset sales totaled $4.7 billion (€3,6 billion) compared with
$5.9 billion (€4,6 billion) in 2012, comprised essentially of the sale
of TIGF", a 25% stake in the Tempa Rossa field in Italy, the interest
in the Voyager upgrader project in Canada, fertilizer operations and
all the Exploration & Production assets in Trinidad and Tobago.

Net investments were therefore $25.9 billion (€19.5 billion) in 2013,
compared with $21.9 billion (€17.1 billion) in 2012, an increase of
18%. They include $2.2 billion (€1.6 billion) related to the sale of
minority equity interests in Total E&P Congo and Block 14 in Angola,
which are shown in the financing section of the cash flow statement.

After reaching a high of $28,3 billion in 2013, the organic investment
budget was reduced to $26 billion in 2014, more than 80% of
which will be dedicated to Upstream. Investments in the Upstream
Segment are expected to amount to $ 22 billion and should be
mainly dedicated to major development projects, including GLNG
and Ichthys in Australia, Surmont and Fort Hills in Canada, the
Ekofisk and Eldfisk areas in Norway, the Laggan Tormore projects
in the United Kingdom, Moho North in Congo, CLOV in Angola,
Ofon Il and Egina in Nigeria and Yamal in Russia. A significant
portion of the segment's budget will also be allocated to maintenance
and integrity work on assets already in production.

The Refining & Chemicals segment has an over $ 2 billion capital
expenditure budget, that is expected to be dedicated to the refining,
petrochemicals and specialty chemicals businesses. In particular,
2014 is expected to be marked by the start of upgrade work on the
integrated platform in Antwerp, Belgium. A significant portion of the
segment'’s budget will also be allocated to maintenance and safety,
which are vital to this type of industrial activity.

The Marketing & Services segment has a nearly $ 2 billion capital
expenditure budget that is expected to finance, in particular, the
service station network, logistics, specialty production and storage

facilities (lubricants, LPG, etc.) and the development of this segment's
activities in New Energies. Most of the Marketing & Services
budget will be allocated to growth areas (Africa, Middle East,

Asia and Latin America).

After 2014, TOTAL expects investments to be in line with more
moderate post-2017 growth based on increased production.
Moreover, all the Group’s segments are making efforts to control
their investments and reduce their operating costs while continuing
to make safety an absolute priority.

TOTAL self-finances most of its capital expenditure from cash flow
from operations (see the consolidated statement of cash flow,
Chapter 10, point 5.), which is essentially increased by accessing
the bond market on a regular basis, when conditions on the
financial markets are favorable (see Note 20 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, Chapter 10, point 7.). However, capital
expenditure for joint ventures between TOTAL and external
partners are generally funded through project financing.

In addition, the Group has confirmed the target of selling $15 to
$20 billion in assets over the 2012-2014 period. With $13 billion
in assets already sold" at the end of 2013, the proposed sales

6. Organizational structure

being negotiated and reviewed should enable TOTAL to reach,
and possibly exceed, the target set in 2014.

As part of certain project financing arrangements, TOTAL S.A.
has provided guarantees. These guarantees (“Guarantees given
on borrowings") as well as other information on off-balance sheet
commitments and contractual obligations for the Group appear
in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Chapter 10,
point 7.). The Group does not currently consider that these
guarantees, or any other off-balance sheet arrangements of
TOTAL S.A. nor any other members of the Group, currently have
or are reasonably likely to have in the future a material effect on
the Group's financial situation, revenues or expenses, liquidity,
capital expenditure or capital resources.

In November 2012, TOTAL announced the sale of the Group’s
interest in the offshore OML 138 Block in Nigeria, which includes
the Usan. field, and in February 2014 the signing of an agreement
to sell its 15% interest in the offshore Block 15/06 in Angola to
Sonangol E&P for $750 million. The approval by the authorities
has not yet been received for the sale of its interest in OML 138.
The closing of the sale of the interest in Block 15/06 is expected
during the first half of 2014.

6.1. Position of the Company within the Group

TOTAL S.A. is the Group's parent company. As of December 31, 2013,

Summary of results and financial position

1. Summary of results and financial position

1.1. Overview of the 2013 fiscal year for TOTAL

The year 2013 was marked by the end of the recession in the euro
zone in the second quarter and the stability of emerging countries.
This improvement was mitigated in the third quarter by the impacts
of significant exchange rate fluctuations in emerging markets and
the budget debate in the United States.

In this context, global oil demand rose sharply by +1.1 Mb/d‘),
compared to +0.8 Mb/d in 2012, driven by demand in Asia and the
Middle East. Global oil supplies were up moderately in 2013 by
+0.4 Mb/d after an increase of +2.3 Mb/d in 2012. Market supplies
remained adequate mainly due to the increase in non-conventional
il production in North America, whereas the persistence of
geopolitical factors, particularly in Libya, Nigeria and Iraq, put a
strain on OPEC production. The oil market environment in 2013
therefore remained relatively stable with a Brent price of $108.7/b
compared to $111.7/b in 2012.

Gas spot prices remained stable in Asia in 2013, sustained by demand,
and averaged $16/Mbtu. In Europe, gas spot prices increased by
more than 20% from $9/Mbtu in 2012 to $11/Mbtu in 2013.
Similarly, after a sharp drop due to the abundant supply of natural
gas following the development of shale gas, gas spot prices in the
United States rose by more than 30% in 2013, averaging $4/Mbtu
compared to $3/Mbtu in 2012.

In the downstream, 2013 saw a sharp decline in European refining
margins, which was partly offset by a more favorable petrochemicals
environment. Given the effect of over-capacities, the continued high
Brent price and sluggish demand, the European Refining Margin
Indicator (“ERMI”)®! was $17.9/t in 2013, compared to $36.0/t

in 2012. For their part, petrochemical margins in Europe and the
United States increased during the year by approximately 25% on
average as a result of lower raw material prices (naphtha in Europe
and Asia, ethane and LPG in the United States).

In this environment, TOTAL's adjusted net income amounted to
€10.7 billion, slightly down from 2012. This result essentially reflects
the decrease in net income of the Upstream segment, which was
partly offset by the increase in net income of Marketing & Services.

The Upstream segment’s adjusted net operating income reached
€9.4 billion in 2013, a 16% decrease from the previous year,
impacted by a less favorable production mix, an increase in technical
costs, especially exploration expenses, and an increase in the
effective tax rate. In 2013, the Refining & Chemicals segment
benefited from the concrete effects of the synergy and operational
efficiency plans and a more favorable petrochemicals environment.
This helped offset the sharp decline in refining margins in Europe
and allowed adjusted net operating income to remain stable compared
with 2012. Finally, the Marketing & Services segment recorded a 39%
increase in adjusted net operating income compared with 2012,
thanks in particular to improved performance in New Energies,

IEA data, excluding biofuels and refining gains.
(2) TOTAL's margin indicator.

which posted significant losses in 2012, and overall growth in marketing
of petroleum products, driven mainly by emerging markets.

Acauisitions were €3.4 billion in 2013, comprised essentially of the
acquisition of a 20% stake in the Libra field in Brazil, an additional
6% stake in the Ichthys project in Australia, an additional 1.6% stake
in Novatek™, the carry agreement in the Utica shale gas and
condensates field in the United States and the bonus for exploration
licenses in South Africa, Mozambique and Brazil. Asset sales totaled
€3.6 billion, comprised essentially of the sale of TIGF, a 25% stake
in the Tempa Rossa field in Italy, the 49% interest in the Voyager
upgrader project in Canada, fertilizer operations and all the
Exploration & Production assets in Trinidad and Tobago. Thus,

of the $15 to 20 billion in sales targeted for the 2012-2014 period,
the Group had already sold $13 billion® in assets at the end of 2013.

As announced, the intensive investment phase aimed at transforming
the Group’s production profile by 2017 reached a peak of $28 billion
(€21.3 billion) in 2013. TOTAL financed its investments and dividends
while maintaining a sound balance sheet and ended 2013 with a
ratio of net debt to equity of 23%. On the strength of this financial
soundness and in keeping with its competitive shareholder return
policy, the Board of Directors decided to propose at the May 16,
2014 Shareholders’ Meeting a dividend of €2.38/share for 2013,
which represents a 3.4% increase for the remaining dividend.

In terms of operations, the Group's production was impacted by
safety issues in Libya and Nigeria, the effects of which were partly
offset by the improved situation in Yemen and by the restart of
Elgin-Franklin in the North Sea and OML 58 in Nigeria.

With responsibility and transparency, TOTAL reasserts the utmost
priority it gives to the safety of operations and its commitment to
environmental protection. Thus, the Group further improved its safety
performance, with a 14% drop in TRIR™ compared with 2012.

For all of its projects conducted in a large number of countries,

the Group also places emphasis on Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) challenges and the development of local economies.

In the Upstream segment, 2013 saw the launch of major projects in
Congo, Nigeria, Canada and Russia and the acquisition of interests in
high-potential assets, particularly in Brazil with the acquisition of a 20%
stake in the Libra field. TOTAL has therefore confirmed its production
growth targets and strengthened its prospects beyond 2017. The Group
also pursued its ambitious exploration program and made large
discoveries in Iraq and Argentina. In 2013, the Group continued to
extend its oil and gas acreage by obtaining licenses in promising
exploration areas, particularly in Iraq, Brazil, Bolivia and South Africa.

In the Refining & Chemicals segment, the synergy and operational
efficiency plans yielded concrete results that, together with a more
favorable petrochemicals environment, enabled this segment to record
stable income despite an extremely weak refining environment in

Europe. The year 2013 was also marked by the start of production

at the SATORP refinery in Saudi Arabia and by the announcement

of the launch of a major investment program to upgrade the Antwerp
platform in Belgium and a project to adapt the petrochemicals platform
in Carling, France, in order to restore its competitiveness.

In the Marketing & Services segment, the Group's strategy is to optimize
its operations in Europe, strengthen its leading positions on the African
continent and in the Middle East and expand its presence in the global
lubricants market, while at the same time maintaining a profitability target
of over 17%. Thus, in 2013, the Group strengthened its leadership in
Europe by increasing its network market share with 600 Total Access
service stations now deployed in France. TOTAL also continued its
expansion in high-growth markets and developed its positions in Egypt

and Pakistan. In 2013, the photovoltaic solar energy sector stabilized
after two years of sharp price decreases. Against this backdrop, New
Energies improved its competitiveness and TOTAL and SunPower
(64.65%) announced a number of successful initiatives, including the
start-up of the California Valley Solar Ranch solar power plant and the
launch of new solar power plant projects in Chile and South Africa.

The process initiated in 2004 to increase R&D budgets continued
with expenditures of €949 million in 2013, up nearly 20%
compared to 2012, with the aim, in particular, of the continued
improvement of the Group's technological expertise in the
development of oil and gas resources and the development of solar,
biomass, carbon capture and storage technologies in order to
contribute to changes in the global energy mix.

1.2.2. Operating income from business
segments

On average, the upstream environment remained stable compared
to the previous year with a Brent price of $108.7/b compared to
$111.7/b in 2012, and an average realized gas price for the Group's
consolidated subsidiaries that increased by 6% to $7.12/Mbtu from
$6.74/Mbtu in 2012. In the downstream, the ERMI (European
refining margin indicator) decreased sharply to $17.9/t on average
compared to $36.0/t in 2012.

2012"). Expressed in dollars, adjusted operating income from the
business segments was $27.6 billion, a decrease of 14% compared
to 2012, due to a lower contribution from the Upstream segment,
which was partially offset by a higher contribution from

Marketing & Services.

The effective tax rate® for the business segments was 55.5% in
2013 compared to 55.3% in 2012.

Adjusted net operating income from the business segments was
€11,925 million compared to €13,351 million in 2012, a decrease

income was $14.3 billion, a decrease of 10% compared to 2012.

Adjusted net income excludes the after-tax inventory effect, special
items and the effect of changes in fair value:

- The after-tax inventory effect had a negative impact on net income of
€549 million in 2013 and a negative impact of € 157 million in 2012.

— Changes in fair value had a negative impact on net income of
€44 million in 2013 and a negative impact of €7 million in 2012.

Special items had a negative impact on net income of
€1,712 million in 2013, comprised mainly of the loss on the sale
of the Voyageur upgrader project in Canada, the impairment of
Upstream assets in the Barnett field in the United States and in
Syria, charges and write-offs related to the restructuring of
Downstream activities in France, partially offset by the gain on
the sales of TIGF and Upstream assets in Italy. Special items had
a negative impact on net income of € 1,503 million in 2012.

The effective tax rate for the Group was 56.8% in 2013 compared
to 56.5% in 2012.

shares compared to 2,270 million on December 31, 2012.

In 2013, adjusted fully-diluted earnings per share, based on
2,272 million fully-diluted weighted-average shares, was €4.73
compared to €5.42 in 2012, a decrease of 13%.

Expressed in dollars, adjusted fully-diluted earnings per share was
$6.28 compared to $6.96 in 2012, a decrease of 10%.

Investments, excluding acquisitions and including changes in non-
current loans, were €21.3 billion ($28.3 billion) in 2013 compared to
€18.5 billion ($23.8 billion) in 2012, an increase reflecting the investments
for the large number of Upstream projects under development.

Acquisitions were €3.4 billion ($4.5 billion) in 2013, comprised
essentially of the acquisition of an interest in the Libra field in Brazil,
an additional 6% stake in the Ichthys project in Australia, an
additional 1.6% stake in Novatek“), the carry on the Utica gas and
condensate field in the United States, and the bonuses for
exploration permits in South Africa, Mozambique and Brazil.

Asset sales in 2013 were €3.6 billion ($4.7 billion), comprised
essentially of the sale of TIGF, a 25% interest in the Tempa Rossa
field in Italy, the interest in the Voyageur upgrader project in Canada,
some fertilizer activities, and Exploration & Production assets in
Trinidad & Tobago. Net investments were €19.5 billion ($25.9 billion)
in 2013, an increase of 14% compared to €17.1 billion ($21.9 billion)

Management Report
Summary of results and financial position

Adjusted net operating income from the Upstream segment in 2013
was €9,370 million compared to €11,145 million in 2012, a decrease
of 16%. Expressed in dollars, adjusted net operating income from
the Upstream segment was $12.4 billion, a decrease of 13%,
mainly due to a less favorable production mix, higher technical
costs, particularly for exploration, and a higher tax rate for the
Upstream segment.

The effective tax rate for the Upstream segment was 60.1% in 2013
compared to 58.4% in 2012.

1.4. Refining & Chemicals results

Technical costs for consolidated subsidiaries, in accordance with
ASC 982(!, were 26.1 $/boe in 2013 compared to 22.8 $/boe in 2012,
notably due to increased depreciation of tangible assets relating to
major project start-ups as well as increased exploration expenses.

The Return on Average Capital Employed (ROACE™’) for the
Upstream segment was 14% for the full-year 2013 compared to
18% for the full-year 2012.

Liquidity and capital resources

2.3. Borrowing requirements and funding structure

The Group's policy consists of incurring non-current debt primarily
at a floating rate or, if the opportunity arises at the time of an issuance,
at a fixed rate. Debt is incurred in dollars or euros according to
general Corporate needs. Long-term interest rate and currency
swaps may be used to hedge bonds at their issuance in order to
create a variable or fixed rate synthetic debt. In order to partially modify
the interest rate structure of the long-term debt, TOTAL may also
enter into long-term interest rate swaps.

The non-current debt is generally raised by the Corporate treasury
entities either directly in dollars or euros or in other currencies which
are then exchanged for dollars or euros through swap issues to
appropriately match general Corporate needs.

2.4. External financing available

The Group has established standards for market transactions under
which bank counterparties must be approved in advance, based on
an assessment of the counterparty’s financial soundness (multi-criteria
analysis including a review of the market capitalization and of the Credit
Default Swap (CDS), its ratings with Standard & Poor's and Moody's,
which must be of high quality, and its overall financial condition).

An overall authorized credit limit is set for each bank and is allotted
among the subsidiaries and the Group's central treasury entities
according to their needs.

To reduce the market values risk on its commitments, in particular
for swaps set as part of bonds issuance, the Group also developed
a system of margin call that is implemented with significant
counterparties.

As of December 31, 2013, the aggregate amount of the major
confirmed credit facilities granted by international banks to the Group's
companies (including TOTAL S.A.) was $11,581 million (compared
with $11,328 million on December 31, 2012), of which $11,421 million
were unused ($10,921 million unused as of December 31, 2012).

TOTAL S.A. has confirmed lines of credit granted by international
banks, which are calculated to allow it to manage its short-term
liquidity needs as required. As of December 31, 2013, these credit
facilities amounted to $11,031 million (compared with $10,519 million
on December 31, 2012), of which $11,031 million were unused
($10,463 million unused as of December 31, 2012).

2.5. Anticipated sources of financing

The agreements for the lines of credit granted to TOTAL S.A. do not
contain conditions related to the Company's financial ratios, to its
financial ratings from specialized agencies, or to the occurrence
of events that could have a material adverse effect on its financial
position.

Credit facilities granted to Group companies other than TOTAL S.A.
are not intended to finance the Group's general needs; they are
intended to finance either the general needs of the borrowing
subsidiary or a specific project.

As of December 31, 2013, no restrictions applied to the use of the
Group companies’ capital (including TOTAL S.A.) that could significantly
impact the Group's activities, directly or indirectly.

Investments, working capital and dividend payments are financed
essentially by the cash flow generated from operating activities,
asset disposals and, if necessary, by net borrowings.

For the coming years and based on the current financing conditions,
the Company intends to maintain this method of financing the Group's
investments and activities.

3. Research & Development

In 2013, Research & Development (R&D) expenses amounted to
€949 million, compared with €805 million in 2012 and €776 million
in 2011. The process initiated in 2004 to increase R&D budgets
continued in 2013.

In 2013, 4,684 people were dedicated to R&D activities, compared
with 4,110 in 2012 and 3,946 in 2011. This is mainly due to changes
in the scope of the Group's activities.

There are six major R&D focuses at TOTAL:

- developing knowledge, tools and technological mastery to discover
and profitably operate complex oil and gas resources to help meet
the global demand for energy;

- developing and industrializing solar, biomass and carbon capture
and storage technologies to help prepare for future energy needs;

developing practical, innovative and competitive materials and
products that meet customers’ specific needs, contribute to the
emergence of new features and systems, enable current materials
to be replaced by materials showing higher performance for users,
and address the challenges of improved energy efficiency, lower
environmental impact and toxicity, better management of their life
cycle and waste recovery;

3.1. Upstream segment

- developing, industrializing and improving first-level competitive
processes for the conversion of oil, coal and biomass resources.
to adapt to changes in resources and markets, improve reliability
and safety, achieve better energy efficiency, reduce the environmental
footprint and maintain the Group's economic margins in the long
term;

- understanding and measuring the impacts of the Group's
operations and products on ecosystems (water, soil, air,
biodiversity) and recovering waste to improve environmental
safety, as part of the regulation in place, and reduce their
environmental footprint to achieve sustainability in the Group's
operations; and

— mastering and using innovative technologies such as
biotechnologies, materials sciences, nanotechnologies, high-
performance computing, information and communications
technologies and new analytic techniques.

These issues are addressed synergistically within a portfolio of
projects. Different aspects may be looked at independently by
different divisions.

The portfolio managed by the entity tasked with developing SMEs
specialized in innovative energy technologies and cleantechs has
grown regularly since 2009.

3.1.1. Exploration & Production

In addition to continuously optimizing the development of deep-
offshore projects and gas resources, TOTAL continues to improve
its computing, exploration, seismic acquisition and processing tools
over the long term as well as those for the initial appraisal of
hydrocarbon reservoirs and simulation of field evolution during
operations, especially for tight, very deep or carbonated reservoirs.

R&D activity has been intensified in the field of unconventional
resources, with a strong focus on water management throughout the
production cycle and the search for alternatives to hydraulic fracking.

Anew direction is being taken to carry out deep offshore operations
in even deeper waters, on the one hand, and at greater distances
for multiphase production transport, on the other hand, which is
fully in line with the ambitious goals of Exploration & Production and
supports major technology-intensive assets such as Libra in Brazil
(see point 2.1.7.3. of Chapter 2).

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

Enhancing oil recovery from mature reservoirs and recovery of heavy
cil and bitumen with lesser environmental impacts are also subjects
involving very active research. In particular, new technologies for the
exploitation of oil shales by pyrolysis are being developed, both in situ
and ex situ.

The oxycombustion CO, capture and storage project in the depleted
Rousse reservoir in Lacg (France) is now in the monitoring phase
following the injection phase, which ended in April 2013. The Group
now has a strong command of the methods used to characterize
reservoirs for this type of injection. New projects will look into new
and more economical capturing solutions.

Finally, water management and the production of hydrocarbons are
still the subject of increased R&D activities. This subject is now part
of a larger program dedicated to acceptability.

3.1.2. Gas & Power

The program to develop new LNG solutions is continuing.

3.2. Refining & Chemicals segment

Management Report
Research & Development

3.2.1. Refining & Chemicals

The aim of R&D is to support the medium and long-term development
of Refining & Chemicals. In doing so, it contributes to the technological
differentiation of this business through the development, implementation
and promotion of effective R&D programs that pave the way for the
industrialization of knowledge, processes and technologies.

In line with the Refining & Chemicals strategy, R&D places special
emphasis on the following four major challenges: take advantage of
different types of feedstock, optimize the value of assets, continue
to develop innovative products, and develop bio-sourced products.
The medium-term strategy of the project portfolio and its deployment
plan will facilitate Refining & Chemicals’ technological differentiation.

To take advantage of different types of feedstock, R&D activities
related to the processing of more diversified crudes have increased
significantly through a better understanding of the effect that feedstocks
have on equipment and processes at the molecular level. R&D is
launching ambitious new programs to develop various technologies
for producing liquid fuels, monomers and intermediates from gas.

R&D is developing know-how and technologies with a view to
optimizing the value of assets. Its efforts mainly involve programs
focusing on the flexibility and availability of facilities. Advanced
modeling of feedstocks and processes helps the units overcome
their processing-related constraints and operate in real time with
these constraints in mind. Research conducted on catalysts is
helping to increase their resistance to poisons, improve catalytic
stability and extend cycle time at a lower cost. Programs are being
set up to maximize the value of heavy residues.

In response to concerns related to social and environmental
acceptability, R&D focuses its efforts on reducing emissions, with
the aim of ensuring that the facilities’ environmental impact is limited.
In anticipation of problems that arise over the long term and the
value of COs, R&D is developing technologies to significantly
reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the use of carbon
capture and conversion.

Product innovation is a key aspect of research on polymers. R&D
draws on its knowledge of metallocenes and bimodality to develop
different types of mass consumption polymers which have exceptional
properties that allow them to replace heavier materials and compete
with technical polymers. Value-added niche polymers are also
being developed, whether in the form of blends, compounds or

3.3. Marketing & Services segment

composites. Efforts to diversify into “green” products are focused
mainly on bioproducts endorsed by the market: biomonomers,
biointermediates and biopolymers. R&D is banking on polylactic
acid for the market launch of new polymers that boast improved
properties. In addition, the development of blends, compounds
and composites broadens the scope of application of polylactic
acid-based polymers.

With regard to biofuels, R&D has focused its efforts on gasification
and coprocessing to produce liquid fuels from biomass. R&D is also
particularly mindful of issues related to blends and product quality
raised by the use of biomolecules.

The efficient use of resources and the management of plastics at
the end of their useful life are topics of growing interest. R&D is

therefore developing technologies that enable plastics to be used
more efficiently as feedstock.

3.2.2. Specialty Chemicals

R&D has strategic importance for the Specialty Chemicals. It is closely
linked to the needs of subsidiaries and industrial customers.

Hutchinson's R&D is built around two key areas:

- materials, with the development of next-generation thermoplastic
alloys and high-performance rubber formulas, as efforts to
protect the environment create new opportunities; and

- ashift from products to systems, based on advanced functions
such as thermal and acoustic management.

Bostik is focusing its research activities on three technology
platforms: hot-melt adhesives, reactive elastomers and hydraulic
polymer-binder systems. Based on these technologies, R&D is
developing practical, sustainable assembly solutions that meet the
needs of markets in terms of energy efficiency (construction, transport),
material efficiency (health, industry) and environmental impacts
throughout their life cycle.

Atotech is one of the world leaders for integrated production
systems (chemicals, equipment, know-how and service) for
industrial surface finishing and the manufacturing of integrated
circuits. Given the environmental challenges related to electroplating,
nearly half of Atotech’s R&D projects are intended to develop cleaner
technologies and create conditions for the Sustainable Development
of these industries.

3.3.1. Marketing & Services

In 2013, in response to the roadmap and the new scope of
Marketing & Services, R&D reorganized its business areas.

In anticipation of changes in technologies, the main lines of research
involve the design of new higher-quality, high-performance products
to support the international development of the businesses: fuel
economy (fuels, lubricants, additives), energy efficiency (bitumen),
anticipation of regulatory changes (marine lubricants) and blending
of bio-sourced molecules (aviation fuels and special fluids).

The development of the future range of Excellium fuels, which focus
mainly on fuel economy and “engine” cleanliness, has made it possible
to validate and integrate new molecules (friction modifier/anti-lacquering)
as well as a new detergent technology developed in-house.

The Fuel Eco lubricant range was expanded with many new products.
added to comply with the specifications of manufacturers targeted
by the Total Lubrifiants business line. New marine lubricants for
two-stroke engines are being developed to anticipate changes in
fuel (very low sulfur rate in coastal areas) and emissions requirements.

Management Report
Research & Development

To meet energy efficiency requirements by reducing application
temperatures, a new bitumen has been developed and released on
the European market. The formulation of a sulfur-free specialty
bitumen, aimed at reducing users’ exposure to H2S, is continuing.

New formulations of broader spectrum cold flow properties
additives that include an exclusive booster for distillates have been
developed and are being sold. The multi-partner CAER (alternative
aviation fuels) project certified by the Directorate General for
Aviation has been launched. The aim of this project is to understand
the behavior of new components, from Upstream logistics to
Downstream turbojet operation.

The conditions related to the hydroprocessing of local feedstocks
were determined based on future special fluids production units
and the initial tests on renewable feedstock pilot programs.

Finally, researchers have also demonstrated their know-how and
expertise in the competitive arena by developing brand new products
(fuels and lubricants for racing teams that were again world
champions in 2013), products and technologies that are later
adapted to consumer products.

3.4. Environment

3.3.2. New Energies

R&D efforts in New Energies cover both the production processes
of SunPower cells, which aim to speed up the reduction of
production costs, and the future generations of photovoltaic cells,
as part of several partnerships with recognized academic research
institutes and start-ups. In particular, TOTAL is a partner in the
important institutional project, IPVF, launched by the Université
Paris-Saclay.

Energy production from biomass is the other major R&D challenge
in the development of New Energies. Through its own biotechnology
research team, the Group is taking part in a program to develop
several production processes using biomass, and in biotechnological
projects to transform the biomass into advanced biofuels or
molecules that can be used in chemical applications. The Group's
main partnership is with Amyris, in which the Group holds a stake.

Environmental issues are important throughout the Group and are
taken into account in all R&D projects. R&D's effort is to ensure
optimum management of environmental risk, particularly as regards:

— water management, notably by reducing the use of water from
natural continental environments and by lowering emissions in
compliance with local, national and international regulations;

- reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by improving energy
efficiency and the monitoring of carbon capture and storage and
the potential effects of CO. on the natural environment;

3.5. R&D organization

— detection and reduction of emissions into the air and simulation
of their dissemination;

— prevention of soil contamination and regulatory compliance with
regard to historical aspects and the rehabilitation of sites;

- changes in the Group's different products and management of
their life cycle, in particular in compliance with the REACH
Directive.

For more information, refer to Chapter 7.

The Group intends to increase R&D in all of its sectors through
cross-functional themes and technologies. Attention is paid to
synergies of R&D efforts between business units.

The Group has twenty-one R&D sites worldwide and has
developed approximately 600 partnerships with other industrial
groups and academic or highly specialized research institutes.
TOTAL also has a permanently renewed network of scientific
advisors worldwide that monitor and advise on matters of interest

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

to the Group’s R&D activities. Long-term partnerships with
universities and academic laboratories, deemed strategic in Europe,
the United States, Japan and China, as well as innovative small
businesses are part of the Group's approach.

Each segment is developing an active intellectual property activity,
aimed at protecting its innovations, allowing its activity to develop
without constraints as well as facilitating its partnerships. In 2013,
more than 250 new patent applications were issued by the Group.

4.1. Outlook

Management Report
Trends and outlook

After reaching a peak of $28 billion in 2013, the organic investment
budget was reduced to $26 billion in 2014, more than 80% of which
will be dedicated to Upstream. Moreover, all the Group's segments
are making efforts to control their investments and reduce their
operating costs while continuing to make safety an absolute priority.

Of the $15 to 20 billion in sales targeted for the 2012-2014 period,
the Group had already sold $13 billion” in assets at the end of 2013.
The proposed sales being negotiated and reviewed should enable

TOTAL to reach, and possibly exceed, the announced target.

In the Upstream segment, TOTAL confirmed its production growth
targets of 2.6 Mboe/d by 2015 and the potential for 3 Mboe/d by
2017. Nearly all the projects needed to achieve these targets are
now either in production or in the development phase. In 2014,
after the expiration of the ADCO license, production will benefit
from a ramp-up of recently started projects and from the start-up
of TOTAL-operated projects like CLOV in Angola, Laggan-Tormore
in the UK and Ofon Phase 2 in Nigeria.

TOTAL is pursuing its ambitious exploration program with a stable
budget of $2.8 billion. This program includes, in particular, high-

4.2. Risks and uncertainties

potential drilling in Brazil, the Kwanza Basin in Angola, Ivory Coast
and South Africa.

In the Refining & Chemicals segment, the productivity gains and
synergies resulting from the ongoing restructuring should continue
in 2014 and contribute, in a constant environment, to the improvement
in the segments profitability. Also in 2014, the start-up of the last
units of the SATORP refinery in Jubail, Saudi Arabia will make this
new integrated platform fully operational.

The Marketing & Services segment will develop its positions

in the most high-growth markets and continue to optimize

its positions in Europe. New Energies, at breakeven in 2013,
should continue to benefit from ongoing efforts at SunPower
focusing on productivity, development and innovation.

Since the start of the year 2014, the environment has remained
favorable in the upstream, while refining margins have continued
to deteriorate significantly in Europe.

The Group confirms its commitment in favor of a competitive
policy for returns to shareholders, in keeping with its objective of
sustainable growth.

Due to the nature of its business, the Group's activities remain
subject to the usual market risks (sensitivity to the environmental
parameters of the oil and financial markets), industrial and
environmental risks related to its operations, and to political or
geopolitical risks stemming from the global presence of most

of its activities.

Risks relative to cash management operations and to interest rate
and foreign exchange financial instruments are managed according

to rules set by the Group’s General Management, which provide for
regular pooling of available cash balances, open positions and
management of the financial instruments by the Group's General
Management.

Detailed information is given in the Risk Factors section (Chapter 4)
of this Registration Document. For more information, also refer to

Risk factors
Financial risks

1. Financial risks

Financial risks are detailed in Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (point 7., Chapter 10).

1.1. Sensitivity to market environment

The financial performance of TOTAL is sensitive to a number of
factors, the most significant being crude oil and natural gas prices,
refining margins and exchange rates, in particular that of the dollar
versus the euro.

Generally, a rise in the price of crude oil has a positive effect on
earnings as a result of an increase in revenues from oil and gas
production. Conversely, a decline in crude oil prices reduces
revenues. For the year 2014, according to the scenarios retained,
the Group estimates that an increase or decrease of $1.00 per
barrel in the price of Brent crude would respectively increase or
decrease the annual adjusted net operating income by approximately
€0.12 billion ($0.15 billion). The impact of changes in crude oil
prices on downstream operations depends upon the speed at

which the prices of finished products adjust to reflect these
changes. The Group estimates that an increase or decrease in
European refining margins (ERMI) of $1.00 per ton would increase
or decrease the annual adjusted net operating income by
approximately €0.04 billion ($0.05 billion).

All of the Group's activities are, to various degrees, sensitive to
fluctuations in the dollar/euro exchange rate. The Group estimates
that a strengthening or weakening of the dollar against the euro by
$0.10 per euro would respectively improve or reduce the annual
adjusted net operating income, expressed in euro, by
approximately €0.95 billion.

The Group's results, particularly in the Chemicals activity, also depend
on the overall economic environment.

Summary Scenario Change Estimated impact Estimated impact

(2) Sensitivities revised once per year upon publication of the previous year's fourth quarter results. The impact of the €-S sensitivity on adjusted operating income and adjusted net
operating income attributable to the Upstream segment are approximately 80% and 70% respectively. The remaining impact of the sensitivity is essentially on the Refining & Chemicals
segment, Indicated sensitivities are estimates based upon assumptions of the Group's portfolio in 2014. Results may differ significantly from the estimates implied by the application

of these sensitivities.

1.2. Oil and gas market related risks

Due to the nature of its business, the Group has significant oil and
gas trading activities as part of its day-to-day operations in order
to optimize revenues from its oil and gas production and to obtain
favorable pricing to supply its refineries.

In its international oil trading business, the Group follows a policy
of not selling its future production. However, in connection with this
trading business, the Group, like most other oil companies, uses
energy derivative instruments to adjust its exposure to price
fluctuations of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, power and
coal. The Group also uses freight rate derivative contracts in its
shipping business to adjust its exposure to freight-rate fluctuations.
To hedge against this risk, the Group uses various instruments such
as futures, forwards, swaps and options on organized markets or
over-the-counter markets. The list of the different derivatives held
by the Group in these markets is detailed in Note 30 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1) Calculated with a base case exchange rate of $1.30 per € 1.00.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

The Trading & Shipping division measures its market risk exposure,
i.e., potential loss in fair values, on its crude oil, refined products
and freight rates trading activities using a value-at-risk technique.
This technique is based on an historical model and makes an
assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes
in market values over a 24-hour period. The calculation of the range
of potential changes in fair values takes into account a snapshot of
the end-of-day exposures and the set of historical price movements
for the last 400 business days for all instruments and maturities in
the global trading activities. Options are systematically re-evaluated
using appropriate models.

The potential movement in fair values corresponds to a 97.5%
value-at-risk type confidence level. This means that the Group's
portfolio result is likely to exceed the value-at-risk loss measure
once over 40 business days if the portfolio exposures were

left unchanged.

As part of its gas, power and coal trading activity, the Group also
uses derivative instruments such as futures, forwards, swaps and
options in both organized and over-the-counter markets. In general,
the transactions are settled at maturity date through physical
delivery. The Gas & Power division measures its market risk
exposure, i.e., potential loss in fair values, on its trading business
using a value-at-risk technique. This technique is based on an

historical mode! and makes an assessment of the market risk arising
from possible future changes in market values over a one-day
period. The calculation of the range of potential changes in fair
values takes into account a snapshot of the end-of-day exposures
and the set of historical price movements for the past two years

for all instruments and maturities in the global trading business.

2012 20.9 26 7.4 28
2011 21.0 12.7 16.0 17.6

The Group has implemented strict policies and procedures to
manage and monitor these market risks. These are based on
the separation of control and front-office functions and on an
integrated information system that enables real-time monitoring
of trading activities.

1.3. Financial markets related risks

Limits on trading positions are approved by the Group's Executive
Committee and are monitored daily. To increase flexibility and
encourage liquidity, hedging operations are performed with numerous
independent operators, including other oil companies, major energy
producers or consumers and financial institutions. The Group has
established counterparty limits and monitors outstanding amounts
with each counterparty on an ongoing basis.

As part of its financing and cash management activities, the Group
uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to changes

in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. These instruments

are mainly interest rate and currency swaps. The Group may also
occasionally use futures contracts and options. These operations
and their accounting treatment are detailed in Notes 1 paragraph M,
20, 28 and 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Risks relative to cash management operations and to interest rate
and foreign exchange financial instruments are managed according
to rules set by the Group's senior management, which provide

for regular pooling of available cash balances, open positions

and management of the financial instruments by the Treasury
Department. Excess cash of the Group is deposited mainly in

government institutions, deposit banks, or major companies
through deposits, reverse repurchase agreements and purchase

of commercial paper. Liquidity positions and the management of
financial instruments are centralized by the Treasury Department,
where they are managed by a team specialized in foreign exchange
and interest rate market transactions.

The Cash Monitoring-Management Unit within the Treasury
Department monitors limits and positions per bank on a daily
basis and results of the Front Office. This unit also prepares
marked-to-market valuations of used financial instruments and,
when necessary, performs sensitivity analysis.

Risk factors
Financial risks

1.4. Counterparty risk

The Group has established standards for market transactions under
which bank counterparties must be approved in advance, based on
an assessment of the counterparty’s financial soundness (multi-criteria
analysis including a review of market prices and of the Credit Default
Swap (CDS), its ratings with Standard & Poor's and Moody's, which
must be of high quality, and its overall financial condition).

1.5. Currency exposure

An overall authorized credit limit is set for each bank and is allotted
among the subsidiaries and the Group's central treasury entities
according to their needs.

To reduce the market values risk on its commitments, in particular
for swaps set as part of bonds issuance, the Treasury Department
also developed a system of margin call that is gradually implemented
with significant counterparties.

The Group seeks to minimize the currency exposure of each entity
to its functional currency (primarily the euro, the dollar, the pound
sterling and the Norwegian krone).

For currency exposure generated by commercial activity, the hedging
of revenues and costs in foreign currencies is typically performed
using currency operations on the spot market and, in some cases,
on the forward market. The Group rarely hedges future cash flows,
although it may use options to do so.

With respect to currency exposure linked to non-current assets
booked in a currency other than the euro, the Group has a policy
of reducing the related currency exposure by financing these assets
in the same currency.

Net short-term currency exposure is periodically monitored against
limits set by the Group's senior management.

The non-current debt described in Note 20 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements is generally raised by the Corporate treasury
entities either directly in dollars or in euros, or in other currencies
which are then exchanged for dollars or euros through swaps
issues to appropriately match general Corporate needs. The proceeds
from these debt issuances are loaned to affiliates whose accounts
are kept in dollars or in euros. Thus, the net sensitivity of these
positions to currency exposure is not significant.

The Group's short-term currency swaps, the notional value of which
appears in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are
used to attempt to optimize the centralized cash management of
the Group. Thus, the sensitivity to currency fluctuations which may
be induced is likewise considered negligible.

1.6. Short-term interest rate exposure and cash

Cash balances, which are primarily composed of euros and dollars,
are managed according to the guidelines established by the Group's
senior management (maintain an adequate level of liquidity, optimize
revenue from investments considering existing interest rate yield

1.7. Interest rate risk on non-current debt

curves, and minimize the cost of borrowing) over a less than
twelve-month horizon and on the basis of a daily interest rate
benchmark, primarily through short-term interest rate swaps and
short-term currency swaps, without modifying currency exposure.

The Group's policy consists of incurring non-current debt primarily
at a floating rate, or, if the opportunity arises at the time of an issuance,
at a fixed rate. Debt is incurred in dollars or in euros according to
general Corporate needs. Long-term interest rate and currency

swaps may be used to hedge bonds at their issuance in order to
create a variable or fixed rate synthetic debt. In order to partially
modify the interest rate structure of the long-term debt,

TOTAL may also enter into long-term interest rate swaps.

or decrease of 10 basis points on the interest rate yield curves

As a result of the policy for the management of currency exposure previously described, the Group's sensitivity to currency exposure is
primarily influenced by the net equity of the subsidiaries whose functional currency is the dollar and, to a lesser extent, the pound sterling
and the Norwegian krone.

This sensitivity is reflected in the historical evolution of the currency translation adjustment recorded in the statement of changes in
shareholders’ equity which, in the course of the last three fiscal years, is essentially related to the fluctuation of dollar and pound sterling
and is set forth in the table below:

As a result of this policy, the impact of currency exchange rate
fluctuations on consolidated income, as illustrated in Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, has not been significant over

1.9. Stock market risk

the last three years despite the considerable fluctuation of the dollar
(again of €6 million in 2013, a gain of €26 million in 2012 and
again of €118 million in 2011).

The Group holds interests in a number of publicly-traded companies
(see Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
The market value of these holdings fluctuates due to various factors,

1.10. Liquidity risk

including stock market trends, valuations of the sectors in which
the companies operate, and the economic and financial condition
of each individual company.

TOTAL S.A. has confirmed lines of credit granted by international
banks, which are calculated to allow it to manage its short-term
liquidity needs as required.

As of December 31, 2013, these lines of credit amounted

to $11,031 million, of which $11,031 million was unused.

The agreements for the lines of credit granted to TOTAL S.A.

do not contain conditions related to the Company's financial ratios,
to its financial ratings from specialized agencies, or to the
occurrence of events that could have a material adverse effect

on its financial position. As of December 31, 2013, the aggregate

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

amount of the principal confirmed lines of credit granted by
international banks to Group companies, including TOTAL S.A.,
was $11,581 million, of which $11,421 million was unused. The
lines of credit granted to Group companies other than TOTAL S.A.
are not intended to finance the Group’s general needs; they are
intended to finance either the general needs of the borrowing
subsidiary or a specific project.

The following tables show the maturity of the financial assets and

In addition, the Group guarantees bank debt and finance lease
agreements of certain non-consolidated companies and equity
affiliates. A payment would be triggered by failure of the guaranteed
party to fulfill its obligation covered by the guarantee, and no assets
are held as collateral for these guarantees. Maturity dates and
amounts are set forth in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements (“Guarantees given against borrowings”).

As of December 31
(Me)

The Group also guarantees the current liabilities of certain
non-consolidated companies. Performance under these guarantees
would be triggered by a financial default of these entities. Maturity
dates and amounts are set forth in Note 23 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements (“Guarantees of current liabilities”).

The following table sets forth financial assets and liabilities related to
operating activities as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (see
Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

These financial assets and liabilities mainly have a maturity date below one year.

1.11. Credit risk

Credit risk is defined as the risk of the counterparty to a contract
failing to perform or pay the amounts due.

The Group is exposed to credit risks in its operating and financing
activities. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is partially

As of December 31

The valuation allowance on loans and advances and on accounts
receivable and other operating receivables is detailed respectively
in Notes 14 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As part of its credit risk management related to operating and
financing activities, the Group has developed margin call contracts
with certain counterparties. As of December 31, 2013, the net
amount received as part of these margin calls was €801 million
(against €1,635 million as of December 31, 2012 and

€1,682 million as of December 31, 2011).

Credit risk is managed by the Group's business segments
as follows:

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

Upstream Segment
- Exploration & Production

Risks arising under contracts with government authorities

or other oil companies or under long-term supply contracts
necessary for the development of projects are evaluated during
the project approval process. The long-term aspect of these
contracts and the high-quality of the other parties lead to a low
level of credit risk.

Risks related to commercial operations, other than those
described above (which are, in practice, directly monitored
by subsidiaries), are subject to procedures for establishing
and reviewing credit.


--- Page 83 ---

Customer receivables are subject to provisions on a case-by-case
basis, based on prior history and management's assessment of
the facts and circumstances.

- Gas & Power

Gas & Power deals with counterparties in the energy, industrial
and financial sectors throughout the world. Financial institutions
providing credit risk coverage are highly rated international bank
and insurance groups.

Potential counterparties are subject to credit assessment and
approval before concluding transactions and are thereafter
subject to regular review, including re-appraisal and approval
of the limits previously granted.

The creditworthiness of counterparties is assessed based on

an analysis of quantitative and qualitative data regarding financial
standing and business risks, together with the review of any
relevant third party and market information, such as data
published by rating agencies. On this basis, credit limits are
defined for each potential counterparty and, where appropriate,
transactions are subject to specific authorizations.

Credit exposure, which is essentially an economic exposure or
an expected future physical exposure, is permanently monitored
and subject to sensitivity measures.

Credit risk is mitigated by the systematic use of industry standard
contractual frameworks that permit netting, enable requiring
added security in case of adverse change in the counterparty
risk, and allow for termination of the contract upon occurrence
of certain events of default.

Refining & Chemicals Segment
- Refining & Chemicals

Credit risk is primarily related to commercial receivables. Internal
procedures of Refining & Chemicals include rules for the
management of credit describing the fundamentals of internal
control in this domain. Each division implements procedures

for managing and provisioning credit risk that differ based on
the size of the subsidiary and the market in which it operates.
The principal elements of these procedures are:

- implementation of credit limits with different authorization
procedures for possible credit overruns;

- use of insurance policies or specific guarantees (letters
of credit);

- regular monitoring and assessment of overdue accounts
(aging balance), including collection procedures; and

- provisioning of bad debts on a customer-by-customer basis,
according to payment delays and local payment practices
(provisions may also be calculated based on statistics).

Counterparties are subject to credit assessment and approval prior
to any transaction being concluded. Regular reviews are made

for all active counterparties including a re-appraisal and renewing
of the granted credit limits. The limits of the counterparties are
assessed based on quantitative and qualitative data regarding
financial standing, together with the review of any relevant third
party and market information, such as that provided by rating
agencies and insurance companies.

Risk factors
Financial risks

- Trading & Shipping

Trading & Shipping deals with commercial counterparties and
financial institutions located throughout the world. Counterparties
to physical and derivative transactions are primarily entities
involved in the oil and gas industry or in the Trading of energy
commodities, or financial institutions. Credit risk coverage is
concluded with financial institutions, international banks and
insurance groups selected in accordance with strict criteria.

The Trading & Shipping division has a strict policy of internal
delegation of authority governing establishment of country and
counterparty credit limits and approval of specific transactions.
Credit exposures contracted under these limits and approvals
are monitored on a daily basis.

Potential counterparties are subject to credit assessment

and approval prior to any transaction being concluded and all
active counterparties are subject to regular reviews, including
re-appraisal and approval of granted limits. The creditworthiness
of counterparties is assessed based on an analysis of
quantitative and qualitative data regarding financial standing

and business risks, together with the review of any relevant
third party and market information, such as ratings published

by Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and

other agencies.

Contractual arrangements are structured so as to maximize the
risk mitigation benefits of netting between transactions wherever
possible and additional protective terms providing for the provision
of security in the event of financial deterioration and the termination
of transactions on the occurrence of defined default events are
used to the greatest permitted extent.

Credit risks in excess of approved levels are secured by means
of letters of credit and other guarantees, cash deposits and
insurance arrangements. In respect of derivative transactions,
risks are secured by margin call contracts wherever possible.

Marketing & Services segment

Internal procedures for the Marketing & Services division include
rules on credit risk that describe the basis of internal control in this
domain, including the separation of authority between commercial
and financial operations. Credit policies are defined at the local
level, complemented by the implementation of procedures to
monitor customer risk (credit Committees at the subsidiary level,
the creation of credit limits for Corporate customers, portfolio
guarantees, etc.).

Each entity also implements monitoring of its outstanding
receivables. Risks related to credit may be mitigated or limited
by subscription of credit insurance and/or requiring security
or guarantees.

Bad debts are provisioned on a case-by-case basis at a rate
determined by management based on an assessment of the risk
of credit loss.

Risk factors
Industrial and environmental risks

2. Industrial and environmental risks

2.1. Types of risks

TOTAL is exposed to risks related to the safety and security
of its operations.

TOTAL engages in a broad scope of activities, which include, in
particular, drilling, oil and gas production, processing, transportation,
refining and petrochemical activities, storage and distribution

of petroleum products, specialty chemicals and solar energy.
These activities involve a wide range of operational risks, such as
explosions, fires, accidents, equipment failures, leakage of toxic
products, emissions or discharges into the air, water or soil, and
related environmental and health risks. In the transportation area,

the type of risk depends not only on the hazardous nature of the
products transported, but also on the transportation methods used
(mainly maritime, river-maritime, rail, road and pipelines), the
volumes involved and the sensitivity of the regions through which
the transport passes (quality of infrastructure, population density,
environmental considerations). Most of the Group's activities will
also eventually require environmental site remediation, closure and
decommissioning after production is discontinued.

The following table shows a correlation between TOTAL's operations
and the most significant industrial and environmental risks:

Activity/Risk Fire, Leakage Accidental Pollution Emissions into Consumer
explosion of toxic pollution of soil the air, water health
products and subsoil and soil and safety
Drilling x x x x x -
Hydrocarbon production x x x x x -
On-site processing of hydrocarbons x x x x x -
Transport of petroleum products and chemicals x x x x x -
Refining, petrochemicals x x x x x x
Storage of petroleum products x x x x x -
Distribution of petroleum products x - x x x x
Specialty chemicals x x x x x x
Solar energy x x x x x -

(2) Pollution of soil and subsoil resulting from a long period of operations carried out at the site (ie., environmental liabilities).

The industrial events that could have the most significant impact
are primarily:

— amaior industrial accident (fire, explosion, leakage of highly toxic
products); and

— large-scale accidental pollution or pollution at a particularly
sensitive site.

Each of the described risks corresponds to events that could
potentially harm human health, cause death, damage property,
disrupt business activities or cause environmental damage. The
Group's employees, contractors, residents living near the facilities
or customers can suffer injuries. Property damage can involve the
facilities of the Group as well as the property of third parties. The
seriousness of the consequences of these events varies according
to the vulnerability of the people, ecosystems and business
activities impacted, on the one hand, and the number of people in
the impact area and the location of the ecosystems and business
activities in relation to TOTAL’s facilities or to the trajectory of the
products after the event, on the other hand.

Acts of terrorism against the Group's plants and sites, pipelines,
transportation and computer systems could also severely disrupt
business and operations and could cause harm to people, the
environment and property.

Like most industrial groups, TOTAL is impacted by reports of
occupational illnesses, particularly those caused by past exposure
of the Group's employees to asbestos. Asbestos exposure has
been subject to close monitoring at all of the Group's business
segments. As of December 31, 2013, the Group estimates that the

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

ultimate cost of all pending or future asbestos-related claims is not
likely to have a material impact on the Group's financial position.

Certain segments or activities face specific additional risks.

TOTAL's Upstream segment activities face, notably, risks related to
the physical characteristics of oil or gas fields. These risks include
eruptions of oil or gas, discovery of hydrocarbon pockets with
abnormal pressure, crumbling of well openings, leaks that can harm
the environment and explosions or fires. These events, which may
cause injury, death or environmental damage, can also damage or
destroy oil or gas wells as well as equipment and other property,
lead to a disruption of the Group's operations or reduce its
production. In addition, since exploration and production activities
may take place on sites that are ecologically sensitive (for example,
in tropical forests or in a marine environment), each site requires a
risk-based approach to avoid or minimize the impact on human
health, flora and fauna, the ecosystem and biodiversity. In certain
situations where the operator is not a Group entity, the Group may
have reduced influence and control over third parties, which may
limit its ability to manage and control these risks.

The activities of the Refining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services
business segments also entail additional health, safety and
environmental risks related to the overall life cycle of the products
manufactured, as well as the raw materials used in the
manufacturing process, such as catalysts, additives and monomers.
These risks can arise from the intrinsic characteristics of the
products involved (flammability, toxicity or long-term environmental
impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions), their use (including by
customers), emissions and discharges resulting from their


--- Page 85 ---

manufacturing process (such as greenhouse gas emissions), and
from material and waste disposal (recycling, regeneration or other
process, or waste elimination).

Contracts signed by the Group's entities may provide for
indemnification obligations either by TOTAL in favor of the
contractor or third parties or by the contractor or third parties in
favor of TOTAL if, for example, an event occurs leading to death,
personal injury or property or environmental damage.

With respect to joint ventures in which an entity of the Group has an
interest and the assets of which are operated by such Group entity
under an operating agreement between the joint venture and such
entity, contractual terms generally provide that the operator
assumes full liability for damages caused by its gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

With respect to joint ventures in which an entity of the Group has an
interest but the assets of which are operated by a third party,
contractual terms generally provide that the operator assumes full
liability for damages caused by its gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

In the absence of the operator's gross negligence or willful
misconduct, other liabilities are generally borne by the joint venture
and the cost thereof is assumed by the partners of the joint venture
in proportion to their respective ownership interests.

With respect to third-party providers of goods and services, the
amount and nature of the liability assumed by the third party
depends on the context and may be limited by contract. With
respect to their customers, the Group's entities ensure that their
products meet applicable specifications and abide by all applicable
consumer protection laws. Failure to do so could lead to personal
injury, environmental harm and loss of customers, which could
negatively impact the Group's results of operations, financial
position and reputation.

Crisis management systems are necessary to respond
effectively to emergencies, avoid potential disruptions

in TOTAL’s business and operations and minimize impacts
on third parties and the environment.

TOTAL has crisis management plans in place to deal with
emergencies. However, these plans cannot exclude the risk that the
Group's business and operations may be severely disrupted in a
crisis situation or ensure the absence of impacts on third parties or
the environment. TOTAL also has implemented business continuity
plans in order to continue or resume operations following a
shutdown or incident. An inability to restore or replace critical
capacity in a timely manner could prolong the impact of any
disruption and could have a material adverse effect on the Group's
business and operations. For more information on the Group's
crisis management systems, see point 2.2.3 below.

TOTAL is subject to stringent environmental, health and safety
laws in numerous countries and may incur material costs to
comply with these laws and regulations.

TOTAL's workforce and the public are exposed to risks inherent to
the Group's operations that potentially could lead to loss of life,
injuries, property damage or environmental damage and could
result in regulatory action and legal liability against the entities of the
Group and its officers as well as damage to the Group's reputation.

TOTAL incurs, and will continue to incur, substantial expenditures to
comply with increasingly complex laws and regulations aimed at
protecting worker health and safety and natural habitats.

Risk factors
Industrial and environmental risks

These expenditures include:

— costs incurred to prevent, control, eliminate or reduce certain
types of air and water emissions, including those costs incurred
in connection with measures taken to address climate change;

— remedial measures related to environmental contamination or
accidents at various sites, including those owned by third parties;

— indemnification of individuals or entities claiming damages
caused by accidents or by the Group's activities;

- increased production costs and costs related to changes
in product specifications; and

- costs related to the decommissioning of drilling platforms
and other facilities.

Such expenditures incurred could have a material effect on the
results of operations of the Group and its financial position, if the
Group's reserves prove inadequate.

Furthermore, in countries where the Group operates or plans to
operate, the introduction of new laws and regulations, stricter
enforcement or news interpretations of existing laws and
regulations or the imposition of tougher license requirements may
also cause the Group's entities to incur higher costs resulting from
actions taken to comply with such laws and regulations, including:

— modifying operations;

— installing pollution control equipment;

implementing additional safety measures; and
- performing site clean-ups.

As a further result of, notably, the introduction of any new laws and
regulations, the Group could also be compelled to curtail, modify or
cease certain operations or implement temporary shutdowns of
facilities, which could diminish the Group's productivity and have a
material adverse impact on its results of operations.

All TOTAL entities monitor legal and regulatory developments in
order to remain in compliance with local and international rules and
standards for the assessment and management of industrial and
environmental risks. With regard to the permanent shutdown

of an activity, the Group's environmental contingencies and asset
retirement obligations are addressed in the “Asset retirement
obligation” and “Provisions for environmental contingencies"
sections of the Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet (see Note 19
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Chapter 10, point 7.).
Future expenditures related to asset retirement obligations are
accounted for in accordance with the accounting principles
described in Note 1Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Chapter 10, point 7.).

Laws and regulations related to climate change and its
physical effects may adversely affect the Group’s business.

Growing public concern in a number of countries over greenhouse
gas emissions and climate change, as well as a multiplication of
stricter regulations in this area, could adversely affect the Group's
businesses and product sales, increase its operating costs and
reduce its profitability.

The regulations concerning the market for CO, emission
allowances in Europe, EU-ETS (European Union Emissions Trading
System), entered a third phase on January 1, 2013. This phase
marks the end of the overall free allocation of emission allowances:
certain emissions, such as those related to electricity production,

Industrial and environmental risks

no longer benefit from free allowances, while for others, free
allowances have been significantly reduced. Free allocations are
now established based on the emission level of the top-performing
plants within the same sector (“top 10 benchmark”) and lower-
performing plants must purchase, at market price, the necessary
allowances to cover their emissions over and above these free
allocations. Moreover, the Group's plants will need to indirectly bear
the cost of allowances for all electricity consumed (including
electricity generated internally at its own facilities).

Given these new rules and the European Commission's decision to
apply a “cross-sectoral correction factor” (CSCF) that reduces the
total amount of free allocations for all sectors combined by an
average of 11.6% over phase 3 (2013-2020), the Group estimates
that approximately 30% of its emissions subject to the EU-ETS will
not be covered by free allowances during the 2013-2020 period.
The Group is exploring possible avenues of appeal against the
method of calculating this correction factor.

The financial risk related to the foreseeable purchase of these
allowances on the market should remain low for the Group if prices
for emission allowances remain close to their current level (€5/t CO,).
If significant changes are made to the regulation during phase 3,

such as the authorization given to the European Commission to
intervene at its own discretion in the allowance auction calendar
(backloading), prices for CO, allowances could increase substantially,
which could have a significant adverse impact on the results of the
Group's refining operations. Finally, the revision in 2014 of the list of
sectors exposed to carbon leakage represents another regulatory
uncertainty that, if it were to affect the refining sector in Europe,
could also have a significant adverse impact on the results of the
Group's refining operations.

In addition, more of TOTAL's future production could come from
unconventional sources in order to help meet the world’s growing
demand for energy. Since energy intensity of oil and gas production
from unconventional sources can be higher than that of production
from conventional sources, the CO, emissions produced by the
Group's activities may increase. Therefore, TOTAL may need to
incur additional costs related to certain projects.

Finally, TOTAL’s businesses operate in varied locales where the
potential physical impacts of climate change, including changes in
weather patterns, are highly uncertain and may adversely impact
the results of the Group's operations.

2.2. Management and monitoring of industrial and environmental risks

2.2.1. TOTAL’s policies regarding health,
safety and the environment

TOTAL has developed a “Health Safety Environment Quality Charter”
(see Chapter 7, point 2.) that sets out the basic principles applicable
within the Group regarding the protection of people, property and
the environment. This charter is rolled out at several levels within
the Group by means of its management systems.

Along these lines, TOTAL has developed efficient organizations as
well as safety, environmental and quality management systems,
which it makes every effort to have certified or assessed (e.g.,
standards such as the International Safety Rating System, ISO.
14001 and ISO 9001).

In most countries, TOTAL’s operations are subject to laws and
regulations concerning environmental protection, health and safety,
to which TOTAL ensures compliance. The main laws and
regulations include:

1) In Europe: IPPC and large combustion plants directives (recast
by the IED directive), SEVESO directive, pressure equipment
directive, water framework directive, waste directive, ETS
directive (CO, allowances), Fuel Directive, REACH (Registration,
Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) and CLP
(Classification, Labelling and Packaging) regulations.

2) In France: regulations on natural and technological risks.

3) In the United States: OSHA/PSM (Occupational Safety and
Health Administration/Process safety management of highly
hazardous materials), Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liablity Act (also known as CERCLA or Superfund).

2.2.2. Assessment

As part of its policy, TOTAL assesses risks and impacts in the areas
of safety (particularly process safety), the environment and the
protection of workers and local residents:

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

prior to approving new projects, investments, acquisitions and
disposals;

periodically during operations (safety studies, environmental
impact studies, health impact studies and Technological Risk
Prevention Plan — PPRT in France);

prior to releasing new substances on the market (toxicological
and ecotoxicological studies and life cycle analyses); and

based on the regulatory requirements of the countries where
these activities are carried out and generally accepted
professional practices.

In countries where prior administrative authorization and supervision
is required, projects are not undertaken without the authorization of
the relevant authorities based on the studies provided to the
authorities.

In particular, TOTAL has developed a common methodology for
analyzing technological risks that is being gradually applied to all
activities carried out by the companies of the Group (see Chapter 7,
point 2.2.3.).

2.2.3. Management

TOTAL develops risk management measures based on risk and
impact assessments. These measures involve facility and structure
design, the reinforcement of safety devices and remedies of
environmental degradations.

In addition to developing organizations and management systems
as described above, TOTAL strives to minimize industrial and
environmental risks inherent in its operations by conducting
thorough inspections and audits, training personnel and raising
awareness among all those involved.

In addition, performance indicators (particularly in the areas of HSE)
and risk monitoring have been put in place, objectives have been
set and action plans have been implemented to achieve these
objectives.


--- Page 87 ---

Although the emphasis is on preventing risks, TOTAL takes regular
steps to prepare for crisis management based on the risk scenarios
identified.

In particular, TOTAL has developed emergency plans and procedures
to respond to an oil spill or leak. These plans and procedures are
specific to each TOTAL affiliate and adapted to its organization,
activities and environment and are consistent with the Group's plan.
They are reviewed regularly and tested through exercises (see
Chapter 7, point 2.).

At the Group level, TOTAL has set up the PARAPOL (Plan to
Mobilize Resources Against Pollution) alert scheme to facilitate
crisis management and provide assistance without geographical
restriction by mobilizing both internal and external resources in the
event of pollution of marine, coastal or inland waters. The PARAPOL.
procedure is made available to subsidiaries of the Group and its
main goal is to facilitate access to internal experts and physical
response resources.

Furthermore, the Company and its subsidiaries are currently
members of certain oil spill cooperatives that are able to provide
expertise, resources and equipment in all geographic areas where
the Group has operations, including, in particular, Oil Spill Response
Limited and CEDRE (Center for Documentation, Research and
Experimentation on Accidental Water Pollution).

Following the blow-out on the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico
in 2010 (in which the Group was not involved), TOTAL created three
task forces in order to analyze risks and issue recommendations.

In Exploration & Production, Task Force 1 reviewed the safety
aspects of deep offshore drilling operations (well architecture,
design of blow-out preventers, training of personnel based on
lessons learned from serious accidents that have occurred recently

3. Other risks

3.1. Economic environment

Risk factors
Other risks

in the industry). Its efforts have led to the implementation of even
more stringent controls and audits on drilling operations.

Task Force 2, in coordination with the Global Industry Response
Group (GIRG) created by the OGP (International Association of Oil
and Gas Producers), is developing deep offshore oil capture
systems and planning related containment operations in case

of a pollution event in deep waters. Several of these systems were
positioned in various parts of the world in 2013 and one of them
was tested by TOTAL in November 2013 during a large-scale
exercise in Angola.

Task Force 3 addressed plans to fight accidental spills in order to
strengthen the Group's ability to respond to major accidental pollution,
such as a blow-out or a total loss of containment from an FPSO
(Floating Production, Storage and Offloading facility). This initiative
has led, in particular, to a sharp increase in the volume of dispersants
available within the Group.

The task forces finalized most of their work in 2012 and the Group
has continued deploying solutions to minimize such risks. Detailed
information on TOTAL initiatives in the fields of safety and protection
of the environment is provided in Chapter 7.

The Group believes that it is impossible to guarantee that the
contingencies or liabilities related to the above mentioned concerns
will not have a material impact on its business, assets and liabilities,
consolidated financial situation, cash flow or income in the future.

To manage the operational risks to which the Group is exposed,
TOTAL maintains worldwide third-party liability insurance coverage
for all its subsidiaries. TOTAL also maintains insurance to protect
against the risk of damage to Group property and/or business
interruption at its main refining and petrochemical sites. TOTAL’s
insurance and risk management policies are described in point 5.
of this Chapter (“Insurance and risk management”).

The operating results and future rate of growth of the Group
are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices.

Prices for oil and natural gas historically have fluctuated widely due
to many factors over which TOTAL has no control. These factors
include:

global and regional supply and demand;

global and regional economic and political developments in
resource-producing regions, particularly in the Middle East, Africa
and South America;

the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) and other producing nations to influence global
production levels and prices;

prices of unconventional energies as well as evolving approaches
for developing oil sands, which may affect the Group's realized

prices, notably under its long-term gas sales contracts and asset
valuations, notably in North America;

cost and availability of new technology;

governmental regulations and actions;

global economic and financial market conditions;

war or other conflicts;

changes in demographics, including population growth rates and
consumer preferences; and

adverse weather conditions (such as hurricanes) that can disrupt
supplies or interrupt operations of the Group's facilities.

Substantial or extended declines in oil and natural gas prices would
adversely affect TOTAL's results of operations by reducing its
profits. Sensitivity to market environment are described above and
discussed in greater detail in point 1.1. of this Chapter 4.

Registration Document 2013. TOTAL

Risk factors
Other risks

In addition to the adverse effect on revenues, margins and profitability
from any fall in oil and natural gas prices, a prolonged period of low
prices or other indicators could lead to a review of the Group's
properties and oil and natural gas reserves. Such review would
reflect the Company's view based on estimates, assumptions and
judgments and could result in a reduction in the Group's reported
reserves and/or a charge for impairment that could have a significant
effect on the Group's results in the period in which it occurs. Lower
cil and natural gas prices over prolonged periods may also reduce
the economic viability of projects planned or in development,
negatively impact the asset sale program of the Group and reduce
liquidity, thereby decreasing the Group's ability to finance capital
expenditures and/or causing it to cancel or postpone investment
projects. If TOTAL is unable to follow through with investment
projects, the Group's opportunities for future revenue and

profitability growth would be reduced, which could materially
impact the Group's financial condition.

However, in a high oil and gas price environment, the Group can
experience significant increases in cost and fiscal take, and, under
some production-sharing contracts, the Group's entitlement to
reserves could be reduced. Higher prices can also reduce demand
for the Group's products.

The Group's earnings from its Refining & Chemicals and Marketing
& Services segments are primarily dependent upon the supply and
demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined
product sales, with the impact of changes in oil and gas prices on
earnings on these segments being dependent upon the speed at
which the prices of refined products adjust to reflect movements in
cil and gas prices.

3.2. Risks related to oil and gas exploration and production

The Group’s long-term profitability depends on cost effective
discovery, acquisition and development of new reserves; if the
Group is unsuccessful, its results of operations and financial
condition would be materially and adversely affected.

A significant portion of the Group's revenues and the majority of its
operating income are derived from the sale of oil and gas that the
Group extracts from underground reserves developed as part of its
Upstream business. The development of oil and gas fields, the
construction of facilities and the drilling of production or injection
wells is capital intensive, requires advanced technology and moreover,
due to constantly changing market conditions and difficult
environmental challenges, cost projections are uncertain. In order
for this Upstream business to continue to be profitable, the Group
needs to replace its reserves with new proved reserves. Furthermore,
the Group needs to accomplish such replacement in a manner that
allows subsequent production to be economically viable. However,
TOTAL's ability to discover or acquire and develop new reserves.
successfully is uncertain and can be negatively affected by a
number of factors, including:

the geological nature of oil and gas fields, notably unexpected
drilling conditions including pressure or irregularities in geological
formations;

the risk of dry holes or failure to find expected commercial
quantities of hydrocarbons;

equipment failures, fires, blow-outs or accidents;

the Group's inability to develop or deploy new technologies that
permit access to previously inaccessible fields;

the Group's inability to anticipate market changes in a timely
manner;

adverse weather conditions;

compliance with both anticipated and unanticipated
governmental requirements, including U.S. and EU regulations
that may give a competitive advantage to companies not subject
to such regulations;

shortages or delays in the availability or delivery of appropriate
equipment;

industrial action;

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

competition from publicly held and state-run oil and gas companies.
for the acquisition and development of assets and licenses, as
well as from other major international oil companies (refer to point
3.10. “Risks related to Competition”);

increased taxes and royalties, including retroactive claims; and
- problems with legal title.

Any of these factors could lead to cost overruns and impair the
Group's ability to make discoveries and acquisitions or complete a
development project, or to make production economical. It is
impossible to guarantee that new reserves of oil and gas will be
discovered in sufficient quantities to replace the Group's reserves
currently being developed, produced and marketed. Furthermore,
some of these factors may also affect the Group's projects and
facilities further down the oil and gas chain. If TOTAL fails to
develop new reserves cost-effectively on an ongoing basis, the
Group's results of operations, including profits, and the Group's
financial condition, would be materially and adversely affected.

The Group’s oil and gas reserves data are only estimates,

and subsequent downward adjustments are possible. If actual
production from such reserves is lower than current estimates
indicate, the Group’s results of operations and financial
condition would be negatively impacted.

The proved reserves figures of the Group are estimates reflecting
applicable reporting regulations. Proved reserves are those reserves
which, by analysis of geosciences and engineering data, can be
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible
- from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under
existing economic conditions, operating methods and government
regulations — prior to the time at which contracts providing the right
to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is
reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic
methods are used for the estimation. Reserves are estimated by
teams of qualified, experienced and trained geoscientists, petroleum
engineers and project engineers, who rigorously review and analyze
in detail all available geosciences and engineering data (e.g., seismic,
electrical logs, cores, fluids, pressures, flow rates, facilities parameters).
This process involves making subjective judgments, including with
respect to the estimate of hydrocarbons initially in place, initial
production rates and recovery efficiency, based on available
geological, technical and economic data. Consequently, estimates
of reserves are not exact measurements and are subject to revision.


--- Page 89 ---

In addition, they may be negatively impacted by a variety of factors
that are beyond the Group's control and that could cause such
estimates to be adjusted downward in the future, or cause the
Group's actual production to be lower than its currently reported
proved reserves indicate. The main such factors include:

- adecline in the price of oil or gas, making reserves no longer
economically viable to exploit and therefore not classifiable as proved;

- an increase in the price of oil or gas, which may reduce the
reserves to which the Group are entitled under production
sharing and risked service contracts and other contractual terms;

Risk factors
Other risks

- changes in tax rules and other government regulations that make
reserves no longer economically viable to exploit; and

- the actual production performance of the Group's reservoirs.

The Group’s reserves estimates may therefore require substantial
downward revisions to the extent its subjective judgments prove not
to have been conservative enough based on the available geosciences
and engineering data, or the Group's assumptions regarding factors
or variables that are beyond its control prove to be incorrect over
time. Any downward adjustment would indicate lower future
production amounts, which could adversely affect the Group's results
of operations, including profits as well as its financial condition.

3.3. Major projects and production growth

The Group’s production growth depends on the delivery
of its major development projects.

The Group's targeted production growth relies heavily on the
successful execution of its major development projects, which are
complex and capital-intensive. These major projects are subject to
a number of challenges, including:

— negotiations with partners, governments, suppliers, customers
and others;

- cost overruns and delays related to the availability of skilled labor
or delays in manufacturing and delivery of critical equipment, or
shortages in the availability of such equipment;

3.4. Equity affiliates

- unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup
or cause unscheduled project downtime;

- the actual performance of the reservoir and natural field decline; and

— timely issuance or renewal of permits and licenses by
government agencies.

Poor delivery of any major project that underpins production or
production growth could adversely affect the Group's financial
performance. In addition, many of TOTAL's projects under
developments are larger and more complex than past major
projects, which increases the potential execution risk.

Many of the Group’s projects are conducted by equity
affiliates. This may reduce the degree of control, as well
as the ability of the Group to identify and manage risks.

A significant and growing number of the Group's projects are
conducted by equity affiliates. In cases where a company in which
the Group holds an interest is not the operator, it may have limited
influence over, and control of, the behavior, performance and costs

of the partnership, its ability to manage risks may be limited and it
may, nevertheless, be pursued by regulators or claimants in the
event of an incident. Additionally, the partners of the Group may not
be able to meet their financial or other obligations to the projects,
which may threaten the viability of a given project, and they may not
have the financial capacity to fully indemnify the Group in the event
of an incident.

3.5. Risks related to economic or political factors

TOTAL has significant production and reserves located in
politically, economically and socially unstable areas, where
the likelihood of material disruption of the Group’s operations
is relatively high.

A significant portion of TOTAL's oil and gas production and reserves
is located in countries outside of the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD). In recent years, a number of
these countries have experienced varying degrees of one or more
of the following: economic instability, political volatility, civil war,
violent conflict, social unrest and actions of terrorist groups. Any of
these conditions alone or in combination could disrupt the Group's
operations in any of these regions, causing substantial declines in
production. In addition, uncertainties surrounding enforcement of
contractual rights in these regions may adversely impact the
Group's results. In Africa, which represented 29% of the Group’s

2013 combined liquids and gas production, certain of the countries
in which the Group has production have recently suffered from
some of these conditions, including Nigeria, which has been the
main contributing country to the Group's production of hydrocarbons
since 2012, and Libya. The Middle East, which represented 23% of
the Group's 2013 combined liquids and gas production, has
recently suffered increased political volatility in connection with
violent conflict and social unrest, including Syria, where European
Union (EU) and U.S. economic sanctions have prohibited TOTAL
from producing oil and gas since 2011, and Yemen. In South
America, which represented 7% of the Group’s 2013 combined
liquids and gas production, certain of the countries in which TOTAL
has production have recently suffered from some of the above-
mentioned conditions, including Argentina and Venezuela.
Furthermore, in addition to current production, TOTAL is also
exploring for and developing new reserves in other regions of the

Registration Document 2013. TOTAL

Risk factors
Other risks

world that are historically characterized by political, social and
economic instability, such as the Caspian Sea region where TOTAL
has large projects currently underway. The occurrence and magnitude
of incidents related to economic, social and political instability are
unpredictable. It is possible that they could have a material adverse
impact on the Group's production and operations in the future
and/or cause certain investors to reduce their holdings of TOTAL’s
securities.

TOTAL, like other major international energy companies, has a
geographically diverse portfolio of reserves and operational sites,
which allows it to conduct its business and financial affairs so as to
reduce its exposure to political and economic risks. However, there
can be no assurance that such events will not have a material
adverse impact on the Group.

The Group’s operations throughout emerging countries are
subject to intervention by the governments of these countries,
which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations.

TOTAL has significant exploration and production activities, and in
some cases refining, marketing or chemicals operations, in developing
countries whose governmental and regulatory framework is subject
to unexpected change and where the enforcement of contractual
rights is uncertain. In addition, the Group's exploration and production
activity in such countries is often done in conjunction with state-
owned entities, for example as part of a joint venture, where the
state has a significant degree of control. In recent years, in various
regions globally, TOTAL has seen governments and state-owned
enterprises imposing more stringent conditions on companies
pursuing exploration and production activities in their respective

countries, increasing the costs and uncertainties of the Group's
business operations, which is a trend TOTAL expects to continue.

Potential increasing intervention by governments in such countries
can take a wide variety of forms, including:

- the award or denial of exploration and production interests;

the imposition of specific drilling obligations;

price and/or production quota controls and export limits;

nationalization or expropriation of assets;

unilateral cancellation or modification of license or contract rights;

increases in taxes and royalties, including retroactive claims;

the renegotiation of contracts;

payment delays; and
— currency exchange restrictions or currency devaluation.

Imposition of any of these factors by a host government in a
developing country where TOTAL has substantial operations,
including exploration, could cause the Group to incur material costs
or cause the Group's production or value of the Group's assets to
decrease, potentially having a material adverse effect on its results
of operations, including profits.

For example, the Nigerian government has been contemplating
new legislation to govern the petroleum industry which, if passed
into law, could have an impact on the existing and future activities
of the Group in that country through increased taxes and/or costs
of operation and could adversely affect financial returns from
projects in that country.

3.6. Ethical misconduct and non compliance risks

Ethical misconduct or breaches of applicable laws by the
Group’s employees could expose TOTAL to criminal and civil
penalties and be damaging to TOTAL’s reputation and
shareholder value.

The Code of Conduct of the Group, which applies to all of its
employees, defines the Group's commitment to integrity,
compliance with all applicable legal requirements, high ethical
standards and the behaviors and actions the Group expects of the
businesses and people of the Group wherever it operates. Ethical
misconduct or non-compliance with applicable laws and
regulations, including non-compliance with anti-bribery and
anticorruption laws, by TOTAL, its partners, agents or others that
act on the Group's behalf, could expose TOTAL and its employees
to criminal and civil penalties and could be damaging to TOTAL’s

reputation and shareholder value. In addition, ethical misconduct
or non-compliance with applicable law may lead the competent
authorities to impose other measures, such as the appointment
of an independent monitor in charge of reviewing the Group's
compliance and internal control procedures and, if need be,
recommending improvements of such procedures. Regarding
this point, refer to point 4. in Chapter 4 Legal and arbitration
proceedings — Iran for an overview of the settlements between
TOTAL, the SEC and the Department of Justice (DoJ) providing
for the appointment of an independent monitor, who was appointed
in late 2013.

The Group has been deploying ethics and compliance programs
since 2009, as a priority of the General Management. Refer to point
1.10.1. in Chapter 5 of this Registration Document for more details.

3.7. Legal aspects of the Group’s activities

3.7.1. Legal aspects of the Upstream
segment’s activities

TOTAL's Upstream segment conducts activities in various countries
which are therefore subject to a broad range of regulations.
These cover virtually all aspects of exploration and production
operations, including leasehold rights, production rates, royalties,
environmental protection, exports, taxes and foreign exchange

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

rates. The terms of the concessions, licenses, permits and
contracts governing the Group's ownership of oil and gas interests
vary from country to country. These concessions, licenses, permits
and contracts are generally granted by or entered into with a
government entity or a state-owned company and are sometimes
entered into with private owners. These arrangements usually take
the form of concessions or production sharing contracts.


--- Page 91 ---

In the framework of oil concession agreements, the oil company
owns the assets and the facilities and is entitled to the entire
production.

In exchange, the operating risks, costs and investments are the oil
company's responsibility and it agrees to remit to the relevant State,
usually the owner of the subsoil resources, a production-based
royalty, income tax, and possibly other taxes that may apply under
local tax legislation.

The production sharing contract (PSC) involves a more complex
legal framework than the concession agreement: it defines the terms
and conditions of production sharing and sets the rules governing
the cooperation between the Company or consortium in possession
of the license and the host State, which is generally represented by
a state-owned company. The latter can thus be involved in operating
decisions, cost accounting and production allocation.

The consortium agrees to undertake and finance all exploration,
development and production activities at its own risk. In exchange,
it is entitled to a portion of the production, known as “cost oil”, the
sale of which should cover all of these expenses (investments and
operating costs). The balance of production, known as “profit oil”,
is then shared in varying proportions, between the Company or
consortium, on the one hand, and with the State or the state-owned
company, on the other hand.

In some instances, concession agreements and PSCs coexist,
sometimes in the same country. Even though there are other
contractual models, TOTAL's license portfolio is comprised mainly
of concession agreements.

In every country, the authorities of the host State, often assisted by
international accounting firms, perform joint venture and PSC cost
audits and ensure the observance of contractual obligations.

In some countries, TOTAL has also signed contracts called “risked
service contracts”, which are similar to production sharing contracts.
However, the profit oil is replaced by risked monetary remuneration,
agreed by contract, which depends notably on the field performance.
For example, the remuneration under the Halfaya Iraqi contract is
based on an amount calculated per barrel produced.

Oil and gas exploration and production activities are subject to
authorization granted by public authorities (licenses), which are granted
for specific and limited periods of time and include an obligation to
return a large portion, or the entire portion in case of failure, of the
area covered by the license at the end of the exploration period.

TOTAL pays taxes on income generated from its oil and gas
production and sales activities under its concessions, production
sharing contracts and risked service contracts, as provided for by
local regulations. In addition, depending on the country, TOTAL’s
production and sales activities may be subject to a number of other
taxes, fees and withholdings, including special petroleum taxes and
fees. The taxes imposed on oil and gas production and sales
activities may be substantially higher than those imposed on other
industrial or commercial businesses.

The legal framework of TOTAL's exploration and production
activities, established through concessions, licenses, permits and

Risk factors
Other risks

contracts granted by or entered into with a government entity, a
state-owned company or, sometimes, private owners, is subject to
certain risks that, in certain cases, can reduce or challenge the
protections offered by this legal framework.

3.7.2. Legal aspects of the Group’s
other activities

The activities of the Group's Refining & Chemicals and Marketing &
Services are also subject to a wide range of regulations.

In European countries and in the United States, sites and products
are subject to environmental (water, air, soil, noise, protection of
biodiversity, waste management, impact studies, etc.), health
(on-the-job safety, chemical product risks) and safety (safety of
personnel and residents, major risk facilities) regulations.

Product quality and consumer protection are also subject to
regulations. Within the European Union, EU regulations must be
transposed into Member States’ national laws or directly enforced.
In such Member States, EU legislation and regulations may be in
addition to national and local government regulations. In addition, in
all Member States of the European Union, industrial facilities operate
pursuant to licenses issued by competent local authorities that are
based on national laws and EU regulations. It is the same in the
United States, where federal rules are in addition to those of the
various states.

In other countries where the Group operates, legislation is often
inspired by EU and U.S. regulations. These countries may more
fully develop certain aspects of regulation in particular fields, for
example those relating to protecting water, nature and health.

Irrespective of the particular country in which the Group operates,
TOTAL has developed standards based on best practices existing
in countries with strong regulations and progressively upgrades
policies with respect to these standards.

In addition, depending on the country where the Group operates,
its other activities are subject to specific sector requirements that
impose constraints with respect to, for example, strategic oil
reserves holding requirements or and shipping capacities owned
or in chartered.

3.7.3. Competition law

Competition laws apply to the Group's companies in the vast
majority of countries in which it does business. Violations of
competition laws carry fines and expose the Group and its
employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits. Furthermore, it is
now common for persons or corporations allegedly injured by
violations of competition laws to sue for damages.

Some of the Group’s business segments have already been
implementing competition law conformity plans for a long time.

In 2012, a Group policy for compliance with competition law and
prevention of violations in this area (refer to Chapter 5, point 1.10.1
for more details) was adopted. Its deployment is based on a
dedicated organization, the involvement of hierarchies and staff,
and a warning process.

Facteurs de risques
Other risks

3.8. Critical IT system services and information security

Disruption of the Group’s critical IT services or breaches of
information security could adversely affect its operations.

The businesses of the Group depend heavily on the reliability and
security of its information technology (“IT”) systems. If the integrity
of the IT systems were compromised due to, for example, technical
failure or cyber attack, the business operations and assets of the
Group could sustain serious damage, material intellectual property
could be divulged and, in some cases, personal injury,
environmental harm and regulatory violations could occur,

potentially having a material adverse effect on the Group's results of
operations, including profits.

The Information Technology Department has developed and
distributed governance and security rules that describe the
recommended infrastructure, organization and procedures to
maintain information systems that are appropriate to the organization's
needs and to limit information security risks. These rules are
implemented across TOTAL under the responsibility of the various
business segments.

3.9. Countries targeted by economic sanctions

TOTAL has activities in certain countries that are targeted by
economic sanctions under relevant U.S. and EU laws, and if
the Group’s activities are not conducted in accordance with
the relevant conditions, TOTAL could be sanctioned or
otherwise penalized.

The United States has adopted various laws and regulations
designed to restrict trade with Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria, and the
U.S. Department of State has identified these countries as state
sponsors of terrorism. The European Union (“EU") has similar
restrictions with respect to Iran and Syria. A violation of these laws
or regulations could result in criminal and material financial
penalties, including being prohibited from transacting in U.S.
dollars. The Group currently has limited marketing and trading
activities in Cuba and a limited presence in Iran and Syria (for more
information, see point 3.9.2. below). Since the independence of the
Republic of South Sudan on July 9, 2011, TOTAL is no longer
present in Sudan.

3.9.1. U.S. and European restrictions

With respect to Iran, the United States has adopted a number of
measures since 1996 that provide for the possible imposition of
sanctions against non-U.S. companies engaged in certain activities
in and with Iran, including in lran’s energy sector. The United States
first adopted legislation in 1996 authorizing sanctions against non-
U.S. companies doing business in Iran and Libya (the Iran and
Libya Sanctions Act, referred to as “ILSA"). In 2006, ILSA was
amended to concern only business in Iran (then renamed the Iran
Sanctions Act, referred to as “ISA"). Pursuant to ISA, which as
described below has since been amended and expanded, the
President of the United States is authorized to initiate an
investigation into the activities of non-U.S. companies in Iran's
energy sector and to consider the possible imposition of sanctions
against persons found, amongst other activities, to have knowingly
made investments of $20 million or more in any 12-month period in
the petroleum sector in Iran. In May 1998, the U.S. government
waived the application of ISA sanctions for TOTAL's investment in
the South Pars gas field. This waiver, which has not been modified
since it was granted, does not address any of TOTAL's other
activities in Iran. In each of the years between the passage of ILSA.
and 2007, TOTAL made investments in Iran in excess of $20 million
(excluding the investments made as part of the development of
South Pars). These investments will not be subject to investigation
by the U.S. authorities due to the application of the Special Rule
granted on September 30, 2010, as further described below. Since

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

2008, TOTAL's position has consisted essentially in being
reimbursed for its past investments as part of buyback contracts
signed between 1995 and 1999 with respect to permits on which
the Group is no longer the operator. Since 2011, TOTAL has had
no production in Iran.

ISA was amended in July 2010 by the Comprehensive Iran
Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010 (“CISADA"),
which expanded both the list of activities with Iran that could lead
to sanctions and the list of sanctions available. In particular,
CISADA authorized sanctions for knowingly providing refined
petroleum products above certain monetary thresholds to Iran and
for providing goods, services, technology, information or support
that could directly and significantly either facilitate Iran's domestic
production of refined petroleum products or contribute to Iran's
ability to import refined petroleum products. TOTAL had already
discontinued potentially sanctionable sales of refined petroleum
products to Iran prior to CISADA's enactment. On September 30,
2010, the U.S. State Department announced that the U.S.
government, pursuant to the “Special Rule” provision of ISA added
by CISADA that allows it to avoid making a determination of
sanctionability under ISA with respect to any party that provides
certain assurances, would not make such a determination with
respect to TOTAL. The U.S. State Department further indicated at
that time that, as long as TOTAL acts in accordance with its
commitments, TOTAL will not be regarded as a company of
concern for its past lran-related activities.

Since the applicability of the “Special Rule” to TOTAL was announced
by the U.S. State Department, the United States has imposed a number
of additional measures targeting activities in Iran. On November 21,
2011, President Obama issued Executive Order 13590, which
authorized sanctions for knowingly, on or after November 21, 2011,
selling, leasing, or providing to Iran goods, services, technology or
support above certain monetary thresholds that could directly and
significantly contribute to the maintenance or expansion of Iran's ability
to develop petroleum resources located in Iran, or domestic production
of petrochemical products. TOTAL does not conduct activities in
Iran that it believes would be sanctionable under Executive Order
13590. In any event, there is no provision in Executive Order 13590
that modifies the aforementioned “Special Rule”, and the U.S. State
Department issued guidance that completion of existing contracts
is not sanctionable under Executive Order 13590.

On July 30, 2012, President Obama issued Executive Order 13622,
which authorized sanctions for, amongst other activities, (i) knowingly,
on or after July 30, 2012, engaging in a significant transaction for


--- Page 93 ---

the purchase or acquisition of petroleum, petroleum products or
petrochemical products from Iran, or (ii) materially assisting, sponsoring
or providing financial, material, or technological support for, or
goods or services in support of, the National Iranian Oil Company, the
Naftiran Intertrade Company (“NICO”), or the Central Bank of Iran.
There is no provision in Executive Order 13622 that modifies the
aforementioned “Special Rule”. In addition, Executive Order 13622
contains an exception for the Shah Deniz gas field pipeline project,
in which TOTAL (10%) and NICO (10%) participate, to supply
natural gas from the Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan to Europe
and Turkey. This Executive Order was amended and expanded by
Executive Order 13645 (discussed in further detail below), in order
to capture as potentially sanctionable conduct a wider range of
petroleum-related activities. TOTAL does not conduct activities that
it believes would be sanctionable under Executive Order 13622 as
amended by Executive Order 13645.

On August 10, 2012, President Obama signed into law the Iran Threat
Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (“ITRA"), which,
amongst other things, amended ISA and CISADA. ITRA, like CISADA
before it, expanded both the list of activities with Iran that could
lead to sanctions and the list of sanctions available. Amongst other
things, ITRA authorized sanctions for (i) the provision to Iran of goods,
services, technology, information or support above a certain market
value that could directly and significantly facilitate the maintenance
or expansion of Iran's domestic production of refined petroleum
products, including any direct and significant assistance with the
construction, modernization, or repair of petroleum refineries or
infrastructure directly associated with petroleum refineries, (ii)
participation in a joint venture established on or after January 1, 2002
with respect to the development of petroleum resources outside of
Iran where either the Government of Iran is a substantial partner or
investor or where the joint venture could enhance Iran's ability to
develop petroleum resources in Iran, and (iii) owning, operating,
controlling or insuring a vessel used to transport crude oil from Iran
to another country. ITRA also contains an exception for the Shah
Deniz gas field project. TOTAL does not conduct activities that it
believes would be sanctionable under ITRA.

ITRA also added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), which requires TOTAL to
disclose whether it or any of its affiliates has engaged during the
calendar year in certain Iran-related activities, including those targeted
under ISA, without regard to whether such activities are sanctionable
under ISA, and any transaction or dealing with the Government of
Iran that is not conducted pursuant to a specific authorization of
the U.S. government (see point 3.9.2., below). For any annual
report that contains responsive Section 13(r) disclosure, an “Iran
Notice” is separately filed with the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The SEC must notify the President
and U.S. Congress, and the President must initiate an investigation
and make a sanctions determination within 180 days after initiating
the investigation. TOTAL believes that its lran-related activities
required to be disclosed by Section 13(r) are not sanctionable,
and TOTAL has not been informed that it is at risk of possible
imposition of sanctions for activities previously disclosed.

The United States has adopted other sanctions measures, including
the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2012 (“NDAA
2012"),which authorizes the imposition of sanctions on foreign financial
institutions engaged in certain transactions, the Iran Freedom and
Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012 (“IFCA"), which, amongst other
things, authorizes the imposition of sanctions on entities that knowingly
provided goods or services to the energy, shipbuilding, and shipping
sectors, or to port operations, of Iran, and Executive Order 13645,

Risk factors
Other risks

which, in addition to amending Executive Order 13622 as discussed
above, implements certain provisions of IFCA and authorizes
additional sanctions against, amongst other things, foreign financial
institutions that engage in certain transactions, potentially including
those for the sale, supply, or transfer to or from Iran of natural gas,
and for the purchase of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran.
TOTAL does not conduct activities that it believes would be
sanctionable under IFCA, NDAA 2012 or Executive Order 13645.

Also with regard to Iran, France and the EU have adopted measures,
based on United Nations Security Council resolutions, which restrict
the movement of certain individuals and goods to or from Iran as
well as certain financial transactions with Iran, in each case when
‘such individuals, goods or transactions are related to nuclear proliferation
and weapons activities or likely to contribute to their development.
In July and October 2010, the EU adopted new restrictive measures
regarding Iran. Among other things, the supply of key equipment and
technology in the following sectors of the oil and gas industry in Iran
are prohibited: refining, Liquefied Natural Gas, exploration and
production. The prohibition extends to technical assistance, training
and financial assistance in connection with such items. Extension of
loans or credit to, acquisition of shares in, entry into joint ventures with
or other participation in enterprises in Iran (or Iranian-owned enterprises
outside of Iran) engaged in any of the targeted sectors also is prohibited.
Moreover, with respect to restrictions on transfers of funds and on
financial services, any transfer of at least €40,000 or equivalent to
or from an Iranian individual or entity shall require a prior authorization
of the competent authorities of the EU Member States. TOTAL
conducts its activities in compliance with these EU measures.

On January 23, 2012, the Council of the EU prohibited the purchase,
import and transport of Iranian oil and petroleum and petrochemical
products by European persons and by entities constituted under
the laws of an EU Member State. Prior to that date, TOTAL had
ceased these now-prohibited activities.

With respect to Syria, the EU adopted measures in May 2011 with
criminal and financial penalties that prohibit the supply of certain
equipment to Syria, as well as certain financial and asset transactions
with respect to a list of named individuals and entities. These measures
apply to European persons and to entities constituted under the laws
of an EU Member State. In September 2011, the EU adopted further
measures, including, notably, a prohibition on the purchase, import
or transportation from Syria of crude oil and petroleum products.
Since early September 2011, the Group ceased to purchase
hydrocarbons from Syria. On December 1, 2011, the EU extended
sanctions against, among others, three state-owned Syrian oil firms,
including General Petroleum Corporation, TOTAL's co-contracting
partner in the production sharing agreement signed in 1988
(Deir Es Zor licence) and the Tabiyeh contract. The United States also
has various measures regarding Syria. Since early December 2011,
the Group has ceased its activities that contribute to oil and gas
production in Syria.

In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets
Control (referred to as “OFAC") administers and enforces economic
sanctions programs, some of which are based on the United Nations
Security Council resolutions referred to above, against targeted
foreign countries, territories, entities and individuals (including those
engaged in activities related to terrorism or the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction and other threats to the national security,
foreign policy or economy of the United States). The activities that
are restricted depend on the sanctions program and targeted country
or parties, and civil and/or criminal penalties, imposed on a per
transaction basis, can be substantial. These OFAC sanctions

generally apply to U.S. persons and activities taking place in the
United States or that are otherwise subject to U.S. jurisdiction.
Sanctions administered by OFAC target, among others, Cuba, Iran,
Sudan and Syria. TOTAL does not believe that these sanctions are
applicable to any of its activities in the OFAC-targeted countries.

Moreover, many U.S. states have adopted legislation requiring state
pension funds to divest themselves of securities in any company with
active business operations in Iran, and state contracts not to be
awarded to such companies. State insurance regulators have adopted
similar initiatives relating to investments by insurance companies in
companies doing business with the Iranian oil and gas, nuclear and
defense sectors. If TOTAL's presence in Iran were determined to fall
within the prohibited scope of these laws, and TOTAL were not to
qualify for any available exemptions, certain U.S. institutions holding
interests in TOTAL may be required to sell their interests. If significant,
sales of securities resulting from such laws and/or regulatory initiatives
could have an adverse effect on the prices of TOTAL's securities.

TOTAL continues to closely monitor legislative and other
developments in France, the EU and the United States, including
the Joint Plan of Action recently announced among Iran and the P5+1
countries (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United
States of America, as well as Germany) regarding limits on Iran’s nuclear
activities and the suspension of certain United States and European
Union sanctions regarding Iran, in order to determine whether its limited
activities or presence in sanctioned or potentially sanctioned
jurisdictions could subject TOTAL to the application of sanctions.

TOTAL is also closely monitoring developments of the situation in
Crimea and any related regulations and/or economic sanctions that
could be adopted by the authorities.

TOTAL cannot assure that current or future regulations or developments
will not have a negative impact on its business or reputation.

3.9.2. Cuba, Iran and Syria

Provided in this section is certain information relating to TOTAL's
activities in Cuba and its presence in Iran and Syria. For more
information on U.S. and EU restrictions relevant to TOTAL in these
jurisdictions, see point 3.9.1. above.

Cuba

In 2013, Marketing & Services had limited marketing activities for
the sale of specialty products to non-state entities in Cuba and paid
taxes of approximately €425,000 on such activities. Hutchinson, a
Refining & Chemicals affiliate, had limited sales in Cuba of transmission
belts for agricultural machinery via a government-controlled
intermediary that received a commission of approximately €77,000.
In addition, Trading & Shipping purchased hydrocarbons pursuant
to spot contracts from a state-controlled entity for approximately
€101 million and sold energy options to this state-controlled entity
for approximately €4 million.

Iran

Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
requires the Company to disclose whether it or any of its affiliates
engaged during the 2013 calendar year in certain Iran-related
activities. While TOTAL has not engaged in any activity that would
be required to be disclosed pursuant to subparagraphs (a), (b), (),
(d) (i) or (d) (ii) of Section 13(r) (1), affiliates of the Company may be
deemed to have engaged in certain transactions or dealings with
the government of Iran that would require disclosure pursuant to
Section 13(r) (1) (d) (iii), as discussed below.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

The Group has no exploration and production activities in Iran and
maintains a local office in Iran solely for non-operational functions.
Some payments are yet to be reimbursed to the Group with respect
to past expenditures and remuneration under buyback contracts
entered into between 1997 and 1999 with the National Iranian Oil
Company (“NIOC") for the development of the South Pars 2&3 and
Dorood fields. With respect to these contracts, development
operations have been completed and the Group is no longer involved
in the operation of these fields. In 2013, Total E&P Iran (100%),

Elf Petroleum Iran (99.8%), Total Sirri (100%) and Total South Pars
(99.8%) collectively made payments of less than €0.5 million to (i)
the Iranian administration for taxes and social security contributions
concerning the personnel of the aforementioned local office and
residual buyback contract-related obligations, and (ii) Iranian public
entities for payments with respect to the maintenance of the
aforementioned local office (e.g., utilities, telecommunications).
TOTAL expects similar payments to be made in 2014, and it did not
recognize any revenues or profits from the aforementioned in 2013.

In 2013, as part of its ongoing global strategy for the protection of
its intellectual property, TOTAL paid taxes of approximately €1,500
to the Iranian national intellectual property office with respect to
patents filed in Iran prior to 2013. The Group anticipates paying
similar taxes in the future.

Total E&P UK Limited (“TEP UK’), a wholly-owned affiliate of TOTAL,
had limited contacts in 2013 with the Iranian Oil Company UK Ltd
(“IOC”), a subsidiary of NIOC. These contacts related to agreements
governing certain transportation, processing and operation services
formerly provided to a joint venture at the Rhum field in the UK, co-
owned by BP (50%, operator) and IOC (50%), by a joint venture at the
Bruce field between BP (37%, operator), TEP UK (43.25%), BHP
Billiton Petroleum Great Britain Ltd (16%) and Marubeni Oil & Gas
(North Sea) Limited (3.75%) and by TEP UK's Frigg UK Association
pipeline (100%). To TOTAL’s knowledge, no services have been
provided under the aforementioned agreements since

November 2010, when the Rhum field stopped production following
the adoption of EU sanctions, other than critical safety-related
services (/.¢., monitoring and marine inspection of the Rhum facilities),
which are permitted by EU sanctions regulations. These agreements
led to the signature in 2005 of an agreement by TEP UK and Naftiran
Intertrade Co. (“NICO”) (IOC's parent company and a subsidiary of
NIOC) for the purchase by TEP UK of Rhum field natural gas liquids
from NICO. This agreement was terminated by TEP UK with effect
from December 2013 and, prior to that, there had been no purchases.
under this agreement since November 2010. TEP UK's contacts with
IOC and NICO in 2018 in regard to the aforementioned agreements
were limited to exchanging letters and notifications regarding contract
administration and declarations of force majeure. TOTAL did not
recognize any revenues or profits from the aforementioned in 2013.
Furthermore, on October 22, 2013, the UK government notified IOC of
its decision to apply a temporary management scheme to IOC's
interest in the Rhum field within the meaning of UK Regulations 3 and
5 of the Hydrocarbons (Temporary Management Scheme) Regulations.
2013 (the “Hydrocarbons Regulations”). On December 6, 2013, the
UK government further authorized TEP UK, among others, under Article
48a of EU Regulation 267/2012, as amended by 1263/2012 and
under Regulation 9 of the Hydrocarbons Regulations, to carry out
activities in relation to the operation and production of the Rhum field.
As aresult, TEP UK does not anticipate having any contacts with IOC.
in 2014. In addition, on September 4, 2013, the U.S. Treasury
Department issued a license to BP authorizing BP and certain others
to engage in various activities relating to the operation and production
of the Rhum field. The Rhum field remains shut down, but it is
anticipated that production could restart at some point in 2014.

The Group does not purchase Iranian hydrocarbons or own or
operate any refineries or chemicals plants in Iran.

Until December 2012, at which time it sold its entire interest, the
Group held a 50% interest in the company Beh Total (now named
Beh Tam) along with Behran Oil (60%), a company controlled by
entities with ties to the government of Iran. As part of the sale of
the Group's interest in Beh Tam, TOTAL S.A. agreed to license the
trademark “Total” to Beh Tam for an initial 3-year period for the sale
by Beh Tam of lubricants to domestic consumers in Iran. Total E&P
Iran (“TEPI"), a wholly-owned affiliate of TOTAL S.A., expects to receive,
on behalf of TOTAL S.A., annual royalty payments in Rials from Beh
Tam during the period 2014-2016 for such license. Each payment
will be based on Beh Tam'’s sales of lubricants during the previous
calendar year. Representatives of the Group and Beh Tam met twice
in 2013 to discuss the local lubricants market and further discussions
are expected to take place in the future. TEPI received payments in
2013 from Beh Tam in Rials of approximately €2.6 million that
corresponded to an outstanding 2011 Beh Total dividend payment
and the settling of debts related to the Group's prior ownership.
Similar payments, in addition to the royalty payments described
above, are expected to be received from Beh Tam in 2014.

Total Marketing Middle East FZE (“TMME"), a wholly-owned affiliate
of the Group, which had stopped sales of lubricants to Beh Total at
the end of 2012, decided in 2013 to resume such sales to Beh Tam in Iran.
The sale in 2013 of approximately 188 t of lubricants generated gross
revenue of approximately €1.0 million and a net profit of approximately
€0.2 million. TMME expects to continue such activity in 2014.

Total Oil Turkiye A.S. (“TOT A.S."), a company wholly owned by

the Group and three Group employees, sold in 2013 approximately
81 t of additives to a private held Turkish company not affiliated with
the Group, which subsequently sold such additives to Beh Tam for
the manufacture of lubricants. This activity generated for TOT A.S.
gross revenue of approximately €296,000 and a net profit of
approximately €54,000. TOT A.S. does not expect to continue

this activity in 2014.

Total Ethiopia Ltd (“TEL”), an Ethiopian company held 99.99% by
the Group and the rest by three Group Employees, paid approximately
€63,000 in 2013 to Merific Iran Gas Co, an Ethiopian company
majority-owned by entities affiliated with the government of Iran,
pursuant to a contract for the transport and storage of LPG in Ethiopia

purchased by TEL from international markets. TEL expects to stop
pursuing this activity in 2014.

Total Belgium NV (‘Total Belgium”), a company held 99.99% by the
Group and the rest by an individual, provided in early 2013 fuel payment
cards to Iranian diplomatic missions in Belgium for use in the Group's
service stations. In 2013, these activities generated gross revenue
of approximately €27,500 and net income of approximately €550.
The Company terminated this contractual agreement in 2013. In
addition, Total Belgium supplied approximately 11,000 liters of heating
fuel (gasoil) to the Iranian Embassy in Brussels. In 2013, this activity
generated gross revenue of approximately €9,500 and net income
of approximately €1,500. Such supply arrangements ceased in
December 2013 and there are no plans to resume such supply.

Total Deutschland GmbH (‘Total Deutschland”), a German company
wholly-owned by the Group, provided in 2013 fuel payment cards
to Iranian diplomatic missions in Germany for use in the Group's
service stations. In 2013, these activities generated gross revenue
of approximately € 4,400 and a net profit of approximately € 50.
Total Deutschland is in the process of terminating these arrangements.

In addition, the Group holds a 50% interest in, but does not operate,
Samsung Total Petrochemicals Co. Ltd (“STC”), a South Korean
incorporated joint venture with Samsung General Chemicals Co.,
Ltd. (50%). In reliance on the exemption provided in Section

1245 (d) (4) (d) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)
announced on December 7, 2012, STC purchased approximately
150,000 t of condensates in early 2013 directly or indirectly from
companies affiliated with the Iranian government for approximately
€94 million. As such condensates are used by STC as inputs for its
manufacturing processes, it is not possible to estimate the revenues
from sales or net income attributable to such purchases. STC
stopped such purchases in March 2013.

Syria

Since early December 2011, TOTAL has ceased its activities that
contribute to oil and gas production in Syria and maintains a local
office solely for non-operational functions. In 2013, TOTAL made
payments of approximately €0.5 million to Syrian government
agencies in the form of taxes and contributions for services rendered
by the Syrian public sector in relation to the maintenance of the
aforementioned office and its personnel.

TOTAL'’s competitors are comprised of national oil companies and
international oil companies. The evolutions of the energy sector
have opened the door to new competitors, increased market price
volatility and called the viability of long-term contracts into question.

TOTAL is subject to competition from other oil companies in the
acquisition of assets and licenses for the exploration and production
of oil and natural gas as well as for the sale of manufactured
products based on crude and refined oil. In the gas sector, major
producers are becoming interested in the downstream value chain
and are competing directly with established distribution companies,
including those that belong to the Group. Increased competitive
pressure could have a significant negative effect on the sales
prices, margins and market shares of the Group's companies.

(1) Source: Reuters.

The pursuit of unconventional gas development, particularly in the
United States, has contributed to falling market prices and a
marked difference between spot and long-term contract prices.
The competitiveness of long-term contracts indexed to oil prices
could be affected if this discrepancy persists and if it should prove
difficult to invoke price revision clauses.

The major international oil companies in competition with TOTAL
are ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and BP. As of
December 31, 2013, TOTAL ranked fifth among these companies
in terms of market capitalization".

Risk factors
Legal and arbitration proceedings

4. Legal and arbitration proceedings

There are no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings, including any proceeding that the Company is aware of, threatened with or even
pending (including the main legal proceedings described hereafter) that could have, or could have had during the last twelve months, a

material impact on the Group's financial situation or profitability.

The main legal proceedings in which the Group's companies are involved are described below.

4.1. Antitrust investigations

The principal antitrust proceedings in which the Group's companies
are involved are described below.

4.1.1. Refining & Chemicals segment

As part of the spin-off of Arkema" in 2006, TOTAL S.A. and certain
other Group companies granted to Arkema for a period of ten years
a guarantee for potential monetary consequences related to antitrust
proceedings arising from events prior to the spin-off. As of
December 31, 2013, all public and civil proceedings covered by the
guarantee were definitively resolved in Europe and in the United
States. Despite the fact that Arkema has implemented since 2001
compliance procedures that are designed to prevent its employees
from violating antitrust provisions, it is not possible to exclude the
possibility that the relevant authorities could commence additional
proceedings involving Arkema regarding events prior to the spin-off.

4.1.2. Marketing & Services segment

- The administrative procedure opened by the European
Commission against TOTAL Nederland N.V and TOTAL S.A., as.
parent company, in relation to practices regarding a product line
of the Marketing & Services segment, resulted in a condemnation
in 2006 that became definitive in 2012. The resulting fine
(€20.25 million) and interest thereon were paid during the first
quarter of 2013.

Following the appeal lodged by the Group's companies against
the European Commission's 2008 decision fining Total Marketing
Services an amount of € 128.2 million, in relation to practices

4.2. Grande Paroisse

regarding a product line of the Marketing & Services segment,
which the Company had already paid, and concerning which
TOTAL S.A. was declared jointly liable as the parent company,
the relevant European court decided during the third quarter of
2013 to reduce the fine imposed on Total Marketing Services to
€125.5 million without modifying the liability of TOTAL S.A. as
parent company. Appeals have been lodged against this
judgment.

In the United Kingdom, a settlement took place in the third
quarter of 2013 putting an end to the civil proceeding initiated
against TOTAL S.A., Total Marketing Services and other companies,
by third parties alleging damages in connection with practices
already sanctioned by the European Commission. A similar civil
proceeding is pending in the Netherlands. At this stage, the
plaintiffs have not communicated the amount of their claim.

Finally, in Italy, in 2013, a civil proceeding was initiated against
TOTAL S.A. and its subsidiary Total Aviazione Italia Srl before the
competent Italian civil court. The plaintiff claims against

TOTAL S.A., its subsidiary and other third parties, damages that
it estimates to be nearly €908 million. This procedure follows
practices that had been sanctioned by the Italian competition
authority in 2006. The existence and the assessment of the
alleged damages in this procedure involving multiple defendants
are strongly contested.

Whatever the evolution of the proceedings described above, the
Group believes that their outcome should not have a material adverse
effect on the Group's financial situation or consolidated results.

An explosion occurred at the Grande Paroisse industrial site in the
city of Toulouse in France on September 21, 2001. Grande
Paroisse, a former subsidiary of Atofina which became a subsidiary
of Elf Aquitaine Fertilisants on December 31, 2004, as part of the
reorganization of the Chemicals segment, was principally engaged
in the production and sale of agricultural fertilizers. The explosion,
which involved a stockpile of ammonium nitrate pellets, destroyed a
portion of the site and caused the death of thirty-one people,
including twenty-one workers at the site, and injured many others.
The explosion also caused significant damage to certain property in
part of the city of Toulouse.

This plant has been closed and individual assistance packages
have been provided for employees. The site has been rehabilitated.

On December 14, 2006, Grande Paroisse signed, under the
supervision of the city of Toulouse, a deed whereby it donated the
former site of the AZF plant to the greater agglomeration of
Toulouse (CAGT) and the Caisse des dépdts et consignations and
its subsidiary ICADE. Under this deed, TOTAL S.A. guaranteed the
site remediation obligations of Grande Paroisse and granted a
€10 million endowment to the InNaBioSanté research foundation
as part of the setting up of a cancer research center at the site by
the city of Toulouse.

After having articulated several hypotheses, the Court-appointed
experts did not maintain in their final report filed on May 11, 2006,
that the accident was caused by pouring a large quantity of a

have retained a scenario where a container of chlorine compound
sweepings was poured between a layer of wet ammonium nitrate
covering the floor and a quantity of dry agricultural nitrate at a
location not far from the principal storage site. This is claimed to
have caused an explosion which then spread into the main storage
site. Grande Paroisse was investigated based on this new hypothesis
in 2006; Grande Paroisse is contesting this explanation, which it
believes to be based on elements that are not factually accurate.

On July 9, 2007, the investigating magistrate brought charges
against Grande Paroisse and the former Plant Manager before the
Toulouse Criminal Court. In late 2008, TOTAL S.A. and Mr. Thierry
Desmarest, Chairman and CEO at the time of the event, were
summoned to appear in Court pursuant to a request by a victims
association.

On November 19, 2009, the Toulouse Criminal Court acquitted
both the former Plant Manager, and Grande Paroisse due to the
lack of reliable evidence for the explosion. The Court also ruled that
the summonses against TOTAL S.A. and Mr. Thierry Desmarest
were inadmissible.

Due to the presumption of civil liability that applied to Grande
Paroisse, the Court declared Grande Paroisse civilly liable for the
damages caused by the explosion to the victims in its capacity as
custodian and operator of the plant.

Risk factors
Legal and arbitration proceedings

The Prosecutor's office, together with certain third parties, appealed
the Toulouse Criminal Court verdict. In order to preserve its rights,
Grande Paroisse lodged a cross-appeal with respect to civil charges.

By its decision of September 24, 2012, the Court of Appeal of
Toulouse (Cour d‘appel de Toulouse) upheld the lower court verdict
pursuant to which the summonses against TOTAL S.A. and

Mr. Thierry Desmarest were determined to be inadmissible. This
element of the decision has been appealed by certain third parties
before the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation).

The Court of Appeal considered, however, that the explosion was
the result of the chemical accident described by the court-
appointed experts. Accordingly, it convicted the former Plant
Manager and Grande Paroisse. This element of the decision has
been appealed by the former Plant Manager and Grande Paroisse
before the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), which has
the effect of suspending their criminal sentences.

A compensation mechanism for victims was set up immediately
following the explosion. €2.3 billion was paid for the compensation
of claims and related expenses amounts. A €12.7 million reserve
remains booked in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements
as of December 31, 2013.

4.3. Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic Committee — Russian regions and Interneft

Blue Rapid, a Panamanian company, and the Russian Olympic
Committee filed a claim for damages with the Paris Commercial
Court against Elf Aquitaine, alleging a so-called non-completion by
a former subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine of a contract related to an
exploration and production project in Russia negotiated in the early
1990s. Elf Aquitaine believed this claim to be unfounded and
opposed it. On January 12, 2009, the Commercial Court of Paris
rejected Blue Rapid's claim against Elf Aquitaine and found that the
Russian Olympic Committee did not have standing in the matter.
Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic Committee appealed this
decision. On June 30, 2011, the Court of Appeal of Paris dismissed
as inadmissible the claim of Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic
Committee against Elf Aquitaine, notably on the grounds of the
contract having lapsed. Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic
Committee appealed this decision to the French Supreme Court.

4.4. Iran

In connection with the same facts, and fifteen years after the
termination of the exploration and production contract, a Russian
company, which was held not to be the contracting party to the
contract, and two regions of the Russian Federation that were not
even parties to the contract, launched an arbitration procedure
against the aforementioned former subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine that
was liquidated in 2005, claiming alleged damages of U.S.$22.4
billion. For the same reasons as those successfully adjudicated by
Elf Aquitaine against Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic
Committee, the Group considers this claim to be unfounded as a
matter of law and fact. The Group has lodged a criminal complaint to
denounce the fraudulent claim of which the Group believes it is a
victim, and has taken and reserved its rights to take other actions
and measures to defend its interests.

In 2003, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
followed by the Department of Justice (DoJ) issued a formal order
directing an investigation in connection with the pursuit of business
in Iran by certain oil companies including, among others, TOTAL.
The inquiry concerned an agreement concluded by the Company
with consultants concerning gas fields in Iran and aimed at verifying
whether certain payments made under this agreement would have
benefited Iranian officials in violation of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA) and the Company's accounting obligations.

In late May 2013, and after several years of discussions,
TOTAL reached settlements with the U.S. authorities (a Deferred
Prosecution Agreement with the DoJ and a Cease and Desist Order

with the SEC). These settlements, which put an end to these
investigations, were concluded without admission of guilt and in
exchange for TOTAL respecting a number of obligations, including
the payment of a fine ($245.2 million) and civil compensation

($153 million) that occurred during the second quarter of 2013.
The reserve of $398.2 million that was booked in the financial
statements as of June 30, 2012, has been fully released. By virtue
of these settlements, TOTAL also accepted to appoint a French
independent compliance monitor to review the Group's compliance
program and to recommend possible improvements.

With respect to the same facts, TOTAL and its Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, who was President of the Middle East at the time

of the facts, were placed under formal investigation in France
following a judicial inquiry initiated in 2006. In late May 2013,

the Prosecutor's office recommended that the case be sent to trial.
The investigating magistrate has not yet issued his decision.

4.5. Libya

At this point, the Company considers that the resolution of these
cases is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's
financial situation or consequences for its future planned operations.

In June 2011, the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) issued to certain oil companies — including,
among others, TOTAL — a formal request for information related to

4.6. Oil-for-Food Program

their operations in Libya. In April 2013, the SEC notified TOTAL of
the closure of the investigation while stating that it does not intend
to take further action as far as TOTAL is concerned.

Several countries have launched investigations concerning possible
violations related to the United Nations (UN) Oil-for-Food Program in Iraq.

Pursuant to a French criminal investigation, certain current or former
Group Employees were placed under formal criminal investigation
for possible charges as accessories to the misappropriation of
Corporate assets and as accessories to the corruption of foreign
public agents. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company, formerly President of the Group's Exploration & Production
division, was also placed under formal investigation in October 2006.
In 2007, the criminal investigation was closed and the case was
transferred to the Prosecutor's office. In 2009, the Prosecutor's
office recommended to the investigating magistrate that the case
against the Group's current and former employees and TOTAL’s
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer not be pursued.

In early 2010, despite the recommendation of the Prosecutor's
office, a new investigating magistrate, having taken over the case,
decided to indict TOTAL S.A. on bribery charges as well as

4.7. Italy

complicity and influence peddling. The indictment was brought
eight years after the beginning of the investigation without any new
evidence being introduced.

In October 2010, the Prosecutor's office recommended to the
investigating magistrate that the case against TOTAL S.A., the Group's
former employees and TOTAL's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
not be pursued. However, by ordinance notified in early August 2011,
the investigating magistrate on the matter decided to send the case

to trial. On July 8, 2013, TOTAL S.A., the Group's former employees
and TOTAL'’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer were cleared

of all charges by the Criminal Court, which found that none of the
offenses for which they had been prosecuted were established. On
July 18, 2013, the Prosecutor's office appealed the parts of the Criminal
Court's decision acquitting TOTAL S.A. and certain of the Group's
former employees. TOTAL's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's
acquittal issued on July 8, 2013 is irrevocable since the Prosecutor's
office did not appeal this part of the Criminal Court's decision.

As part of an investigation led by the Prosecutor of the Republic of
the Potenza Court, Total Italia and certain Group Employees were
the subject of an investigation related to certain calls for tenders
that Total Italia made for the preparation and development of an oil
field. On February 16, 2009, as a preliminary measure before the
proceedings went before the Court, the preliminary investigation
judge of Potenza served notice to Total Italia of a decision that would
have suspended the concession for this field for one year. Total Italia
appealed the decision by the preliminary investigation judge before
the Court of Appeal of Potenza. In a decision dated April 8, 2009,

4.8. Rivunion

the Court reversed the suspension of the concession and appointed
for one year, i.e., until February 16, 2010, a judicial administrator to
supervise the operations related to the development of the
concession, allowing the Tempa Rossa project to continue.

The criminal investigation was closed in the first half of 2010.

In May 2012, the Judge of the preliminary hearing decided to
dismiss the charges against some of the Group's employees and
to refer the case for trial on a reduced number of charges. The trial
started on September 26, 2012.

On July 9, 2012, the Swiss Tribunal Fédéral (Switzerland's Supreme
Court) rendered a decision against Rivunion, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, confirming a tax reassessment in the
amount of CHF 171 million (excluding interest for late payment).
According to the Tribunal, Rivunion was held liable as tax collector
of withholding taxes owed by the beneficiaries of taxable services.
Rivunion, in liquidation since March 13, 2002 and unable to recover

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

the amounts corresponding to the withholding taxes in order to
meet its fiscal obligations, has been subject to insolvency
proceedings since November 1, 2012. On August 29, 2013,

the Swiss federal tax administration lodged a claim as part of the
insolvency proceedings of Rivunion, for an amount of CHF

284 million, including CHF 171 million of principal as well as interest
for late payment.

4.9. Total Gabon

Risk factors
Insurance and risk management

On February 14, 2014, Total Gabon received a tax re-assessment
notice from the Ministére de I'Economie et de la Prospective of the
Gabonese Republic accompanied by a partial tax collection notice,
following the tax audit of Total Gabon in relation to the years 2008
to 2010. The amount referred to in the above tax re-assessment
notice is 805 million US dollars.

4.10 Kashagan

The partial tax collection procedure was suspended on March 5, 2014.

Total Gabon disputes the grounds for the re-assessment
and the associated amounts. Total Gabon intends to take all
actions necessary to assert its rights and protect its interests.

In Kazakhstan, the Atyrau Region Environmental Department
(‘ARED”) launched against the consortium developing the Kashagan
field, in which TOTAL holds an interest of 16.81%, a procedure
alleging non-compliance with environmental legislation related to
gas emissions (flaring). ARED issued a claim on March 7, 2014, for

an amount of approximately US dollars 737 million (KZT 134 billion),
of which TOTAL’s share would be approximately US dollars

124 million (KZT 22.5 billion). The Kashagan project's consortium
disputes these allegations.

5. Insurance and risk management

5.1. Organization

TOTAL has its own reinsurance company, Omnium Reinsurance
Company (ORC).ORC is integrated within the Group's insurance
management and is used as a centralized global operations tool
for covering the Group companies’ insurable risks. It allows the
Group's worldwide insurance program to be implemented in
compliance with the specific requirements of local regulations
applicable in the countries where the Group operates.

Some countries may require the purchase of insurance from a local
insurance company. If the local insurer accepts to cover the
subsidiary of the Group in compliance with its worldwide insurance
program, ORC negotiates a retrocession of the covered risks from
the local insurer. As a result, ORC enters into reinsurance contracts
with the subsidiaries’ local insurance companies, which transfer
most of the risk to ORC.

At the same time, ORC negotiates a reinsurance program at the
Group level with oil industry mutual insurance companies and
commercial reinsurance markets. ORC allows the Group to better
manage price variations in the insurance market by taking on a
greater or lesser amount of risk corresponding to the price trends
in the insurance market.

In 2013, the net amount of risk retained by ORC after reinsurance
was a maximum of $54 million per onshore third-party liability
insurance claim, $87 million per offshore third-party liability
insurance claim and $75 million per property damage and/or
business interruption insurance claim. Accordingly, in the event

of any loss giving rise to an aggregate insurance claim, the effect
on ORC would be limited to its maximum retention of $162 million
per occurrence.

5.2. Risk and insurance management policy

In this context, the Group risk and insurance management policy is
to work with the relevant internal department of each subsidiary to:

- define scenarios of major disaster risks (estimated maximum loss);

- assess the potential financial impact on the Group should a
catastrophic event occur;

— help to implement measures to limit the probability that a catastrophic
event occurs and the financial consequences if such event
should occur; and

— manage the level of risk from such events to be either covered
internally by the Group or transferred to the insurance market.

Insurance and risk management

5.3. Insurance policy

The Group has worldwide property insurance and third-party liability
coverage for all its subsidiaries. These programs are contracted
with first-class insurers (or reinsurers and oil and gas industry
mutual insurance companies through ORC).

The amounts insured depend on the financial risks defined in the
disaster scenarios and the coverage terms offered by the market
(available capacities and price conditions).

More specifically for:

Third-party liability insurance: since the maximum financial risk
cannot be evaluated by a systematic approach, the amounts
insured are based on market conditions and oil and gas industry
practice. In 2013, the Group's third-party liability insurance for
any liability (including potential accidental environmental liabilities)
was capped at $850 million (onshore) and $750 million (offshore).

Property damage and business interruption: the amounts insured
vary by sector and by site and are based on the estimated cost
of and scenarios of reconstruction under maximum loss
scenarios and on insurance market conditions. The Group
subscribed for business interruption coverage in 2013 for its
main refining and petrochemical sites.

For example, for the Group's highest risks (North Sea platforms
and main refineries and petrochemical plants), in 2013 the
insurance limit for the Group share of the installations was
approximately $1.7 billion for the Refining & Chemicals segment
and approximately $1.6 billion for the Upstream segment.

Deductibles for property damage and third-party liability fluctuate
between €0.1 and €10 million depending on the level of risk and
liability, and are borne by the relevant subsidiaries. For business
interruption, coverage is triggered sixty days after the occurrence
giving rise to the interruption. In addition, the main refineries and
petrochemical plants bear a combined retention for property damage
and business interruption of $50 million per insurance claim.

TOTAL. Registration Document 2013

Other insurance contracts are bought by the Group in addition to
property damage and third-party liability coverage, mainly for car
fleets, credit insurance and employee benefits. These risks are
mostly underwritten by outside insurance companies.

The above-described policy is given as an example of a situation
as of a given date and cannot be considered as representative

of future conditions. The Group's insurance policy may be changed
at any time depending on the market conditions, specific
circumstances and on the General Management's assessment

of the risks incurred and the adequacy of their coverage.

TOTAL believes that its insurance coverage is in line with industry
practice and sufficient to cover normal risks in its operations.
However, the Group is not insured against all potential risks.

In the event of a major environmental disaster, for example,
TOTAL's liability may exceed the maximum coverage provided

by its third-party liability insurance. The loss TOTAL could suffer

in the event of such disaster would depend on all the facts and
circumstances of the event and would be subject to a whole range
of uncertainties, including legal uncertainty as to the scope of liability
for consequential damages, which may include economic damage
not directly connected to the disaster. The Group cannot guarantee
that it will not suffer any uninsured loss and there can be no
guarantee, particularly in the case of a major environmental disaster
or industrial accident, that such loss would not have a material
adverse effect on the Group.
