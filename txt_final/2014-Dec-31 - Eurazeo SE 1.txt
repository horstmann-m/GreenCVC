Activity and highlights

4.1

4.1.1 EURAZEO ACTIVITY AND

HICHLICHTS

In 2014, Eurazeo continued to fully play its role of active investor,
rotating its portfolio and assisting the transformation of its
investments.

Economic environment

Global economic growth in 2014 was estimated at 2.6% by the UN,
similar to the 2013 growth rate of 2.5%. While growth was comparable
to last year at global level, regional trends highlight a number of
disparities with, in particular, the end of the recession in the Eurozone
which reported growth of 0.8%. Economists forecast a rise in the
global growth rate to nearly 3.1% in 2015, with acceleration in the
Eurozone to 1.3% and in the United States to 2.8%.

Portfolio rotation

Acquisition momentum remained strong throughout 2014 with
18 transactions, including 5 at Eurazeo level and 13 within the
investments. These transactions focused on identified priority sectors
driven by buoyant growth trends.

At Eurazeo level, Eurazeo Capital purchased Asmodee in January 2014
and 10% of Desigual in July 2014, Eurazeo PME purchased
Vignal Systems in March 2014 and Groupe Colisée in October 2014
and Eurazeo Patrimoine purchased an investment in ANF Immobilier
Hotels in June 2014. Within investments, Elis purchased the Brazilian
company Atmosfera; Vignal Systems purchased ABL Lights to form
Vignal Lighting Group; Péters Surgical purchased three companies:
Fimed, Vitalitec and Stericat; Cap Vert Finance purchased three
companies: DCS, Aditia Lease and Phoenix Service; Groupe Colisée
merged with the Asclépios group; Asmodee purchased Days of
Wonder and Fantasy Flight Games and finally Europcar purchased
the French franchise company EuropHall and the mobility company,
Ubeego.

In 2014, Eurazeo drew value from the transformation of its investments,
selling €500 million of assets, primarily through the two-phase sale
(in April and September 2014) of Eurazeo’s 9.1% investment in Rexel.
Overall, Eurazeo realized a total multiple on all Rexel disposals of 2.3
times its initial investment. Three other sales were performed in 2014,
with the sale of Intercos by Eurazeo Capital in March 2014 and the
sale of IMV Technologies and Gault & Frémont by Eurazeo PME.

Net Asset Value

As of December 31, 2014, the NAV is €4,751.2 million or €69.2 per
share, up 3% on December 31, 2013. This increase is limited as the
marked increase in unlisted companies and particularly Europcar
and Elis was offset at the year-end by the downturn in the financial
markets, as reflected in listed shares. As of March 11, 2015, the recovery
in the financial markets enabled the NAV to reach €5,108.0 million, or
a NAV per share of €74.6, a rise of 10.8% on December 31, 2013.

ACTIVITY AND HICHLICHTS

Transformation of portfolio companies

2014 was also a remarkable year for the transformations achieved by
Eurazeo’s portfolio companies.

All Eurazeo Capital consolidated investments reported high operating
results in 2014. Accor, firstly, reported record EBIT of €602 million,
reflecting the good momentum of key markets and the relevance of
the group’s new strategy. Elis reported further growth in EBITDA to
€429 million. Furthermore, the success of the IPO in February 2015
demonstrates the financial markets’ recognition of its transformation
from a French to an international player. Europcar reported Corporate
EBITDA of €213 million, representing a margin of Corporate EBITDA
of 10.8% and over double its 2011 results. Moncler demonstrated the
success of its international expansion and the development of its
store network, reporting EBITDA of €233 million in 2014, up 21% on
2013. Desigual also reported further growth in its sales and operating
results, with a 8.0% increase in EBITDA to €261.5 million. Finally,
Asmodee transformed its profile: thanks to its two acquisitions
(Days of Wonder and Fantasy Flight Games), it doubled its size in
terms of revenue and EBITDA, boosted its publishing division and
strengthened its international expansion.

The other Eurazeo companies also continued their transformation,
marked notably by international development. The acquisitions
detailed above were largely achieved outside France. On the first
anniversary of the opening of Eurazeo’s office in China, the first
partnerships were forged with local players by IES Synergy (Eurazeo
Croissance) and Groupe Colisée, only one month after its purchase
by Eurazeo PME.

Results of activities

Despite an economic context of weak growth in Europe, Eurazeo’s
portfolio companies reported remarkable performance both at
revenue and operating income level, both of which improved year-
on-year pro forma of changes in Group structure.

Activity is measured by economic revenue, which includes the
revenue of fully consolidated companies and the revenue of equity-
accounted associates (Accor, Desigual, Moncler, Foncia and Fonroche
in 2014) weighted for Eurazeo's percentage interest in these
companies. Eurazeo economic revenue is €5,408.2 million for 2014,
up 7.1% on 2013 pro forma of changes in Group structure. Growth was
positive throughout the year, accelerating each quarter (+2.0% in the
first quarter, +7.7% in the second quarter, +9.1% in the third quarter
and +9.6% in the fourth quarter).

In 2014, the contribution of companies net of finance costs grew
49.8% compared with 2013 pro forma of changes in Group structure,
to €230.9 million.

Group results

In addition to these activity results, Eurazeo reported recurring
results generated by asset disposals. Capital gains net of related
impairment recorded in 2014 totaled €75.2 million, including primarily
€29.2 million for Intercos, €11.0 million for the Colyzeo funds and
€8.0 million for Rexel.

2014 recurring net income attributable to owners of the Company is

€89.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with
consolidated net income of €560.9 million on a reported basis and
€644.8 million pro forma of changes in Group structure for the year
ended December 31, 2013.

Refinancing of Eurazeo’s €1 billion syndicated
credit facility

On June 27, 2014, Eurazeo renewed in advance its €1 billion syndicated
revolving credit facility expiring in June 2016.

This new facility, maturing in 5 years with two one-year extension
options subject to the approval of the lenders, i.e. potentially 7 years
in total, will enable Eurazeo to maintain significant financial flexibility
at substantially improved attractive financial conditions. The success
of this transaction bears witness to the confidence of leading banks
and the market in the Company and its financial strength.

4.1.2. EURAZEO CAPITAL HICHLICHTS

Eurazeo Capital purchases Asmodee,

a publisher and distributor of board games
and Asmodee performs two external growth
transactions in the same year

On January 22, 2014, Eurazeo Capital acquired 83.5% of the share

capital of Asmodee, a publisher and distributor of board games and
playing and trading cards.

Asmodee was founded in 1995 by Marc Nunés and is considered a
pioneer in “modern” games (party and family games). It is a reference

EURAZEO

player in France and is also present in seven foreign countries
including the United Kingdom, Benelux and the United States. Its
catalogue includes games such as Jungle Speed, Dobble, Time's Up,
Miss Kipik, Timeline, Ticket to Ride, The Werewolves and Hotel. The
group also distributes Pokemon trading cards in France, the United
Kingdom, Belgium and Spain. Asmodee has nearly 180 employees
and reported revenue of €120 million in 2013.

This transaction was completed based on an enterprise value
of €143 million, ie. 7.9x EBITDA. Eurazeo invested equity of
€98.0 million, while the Company's management, founders and
minority shareholders invested €20 million, for a total injection
of €118 million. The aim is to accelerate the transformation of the
Company into a global leader in the publishing and distribution of
games. Two external growth transactions were performed in 2014.

Firstly, Asmodee acquired Days of Wonder, a reputed leading US
publisher, strengthening Asmodee’s games portfolio, most notably
with the addition of the Ticket to Ride bestseller. Asmodee also
increased its exposure to the US games market and will benefit
from Days of Wonder's digital games development expertise. Days
of Wonder will benefit from the Asmodee network of studios and
increased access to broader international distribution.

Then, in December 2014, Asmodee acquired Fantasy Flight Games,
a worldwide reference in hobby games publishing. This transaction
provided Asmodee with access to Fantasy Flight Games’ operational
infrastructures in North America, as well Fantasy Flight Games’ over-
20 years’ expertise in games development and multi-language games
manufacturing. Fantasy Flight Games will benefit from Asmodee’s
impressive distribution and marketing reach in Europe, greatly
improving its product placement and organized play initiatives.

Eurazeo Capital acquires an investment
in Desigual

On July 10, 2014, Eurazeo signed an investment agreement with
Desigual to accompany the growth of the Spanish brand. Eurazeo
subscribed to a €285 million share capital increase and received 10%
of the shares in the group held by its founder, Thomas Meyer.

Created in Spain in 1984, Desigual designs and distributes clothing
and accessories for women, men and children and accessories for the
home. Its values, strong creativity and unique positioning give it a
true identity. Its multichannel sales strategy has enabled the brand to
develop rapidly over the last ten years.

The Company is enjoying exceptional growth, with revenues
increasing tenfold since 2007 and average annual growth of 29%
between 2009 and 2013. In 2014, revenues reached €963.5 million,
up 16.2% on 2013. With an EBITDA margin of 29.2% in 2014, company
profitability is strong, bearing witness to its good operating efficiency.

Activity and highlights

Eurazeo Capital sells its investment in
Intercos

On March 4, 2014, Eurazeo signed a sales agreement with the
majority shareholder, Dario Ferreri, for its 32.4% indirect investment in
the share capital of Intercos, representing a 14.6% economic interest
after deduction of preference shares and their preferential yield. The
sales proceeds totaled €48 million, with €8.2 million paid in 2014 and
the balance received in January 2015.

Restructuring of APCOA

On July 29, 2014, the APCOA group, its shareholders and its creditors
signed an agreement in principle covering the restructuring of the
group's debt and share capital. This agreement set out the terms
of discussions held in previous months leading to the transfer to
APCOA's creditors of the capital and receivables held by Eurazeo and
its affiliates on the APCOA group. The conclusion of this agreement
confirms the recognition of APCOA in assets and liabilities held for
sale in December 2013 and its deconsolidation during 2014.

Eurazeo Capital sells Rexel in two stages

On April 3, 2014, Eurazeo announced the sale by Ray Investment of
26.9 million Rexel shares, representing approximately 9.5% of the share
capital of Rexel, at a price of €18.85 per share and for a total amount
of around €500 million, by way of an accelerated book building to
institutional investors. Eurazeo, alongside the co-investors, has been
a shareholder of Ray Investment since March 2005. Eurazeo’s share
of the proceeds of the Rexel share sale is approximately €107 million.

On September 23, 2014, Eurazeo announced the successful sale
by Ray Investment s.a.rl of the remaining 20.9 million Rexel shares
held, representing approximately 7.1% of the share capital, for a total
amount of approximately €320 million, by way of an accelerated
book building to institutional investors.

This disposal represents the final stage in Eurazeo’s progressive
withdrawal from the share capital of Rexel launched in 2012. Eurazeo
realized an investment multiple of nearly 2.3 times its initial investment
over the investment period.

Eurazeo Capital and Bridgepoint purchase
the remaining Foncia securities held by the
BPCE group

On November 12, 2014, Eurazeo and Bridgepoint announced the
signature of an agreement with the BPCE group for the purchase of
all Foncia securities held by the BPCE Group, including the bonds
redeemable in shares. Until now, the BPCE Group held indirectly 18%
of the share capital of Foncia Holding and 1.9% of Foncia Group. This
acquisition, performed equally by Eurazeo and Bridgepoint,
represents a consideration of €185 million. Following this transaction,
Eurazeo and Bridgepoint jointly and equally hold the entire share
capital of the Foncia group. This transaction confirms the confidence
of Eurazeo and Bridgepoint in the Foncia group’s robust growth
outlook over the coming years.

4.1.3. EURAZEO PME HICHLICHTS

Eurazeo PME purchases Vignal Systems,

a European leader in signaling lights for
industrial and commercial vehicles and
creates the Vignal Lighting Group by joining
forces with ABL Lights

On February 25, 2014, Eurazeo PME purchased Vignal Systems,
a European leader in signaling lights for industrial and commercial
vehicles based on an enterprise value of €50 million. Eurazeo PME
purchased 77% of the share capital of this company alongside
management.

Founded in 1919, Vignal Systems is a French company with a solid
reputation in its activity sector. Based in Lyon, it designs, manufactures
and distributes signaling products, particularly for trucks. With more
than 40% market share in rear signaling lights for trucks in Europe,
Vignal Systems enjoys solid leadership. Over the past few decades,
the company has consolidated its positions through its acknowledged
industrial expertise, constant innovation by a highly experienced R&D
team, and a first-rate managerial culture. The group has a highly
resilient business model and an organizational set-up that allows it to
ride out market cycles.

Vignal Systems employs 230 persons at its facilities in Vénissieux and
Corbas, France. It reported revenue of almost €50 million in 2013, an
increase of more than 20% compared with 2012 and generates more
than 70% of its sales outside France.

Two months after this acquisition, on April 29, 2014, Eurazeo PME
reinvested €15 million to enable Vignal Systems to acquire ABL
Lights, based on an enterprise value of approximately €25 million,
and create Vignal Lighting Group. Following this transaction, Eurazeo.
held 77% of the new group.

ABL Lights is the number two company in Europe and the United
States for work lights for off-road vehicles used in areas such as
construction, mining, agriculture and forestry. Founded in 1875 and
formed by the merger of three companies - French, American and
Swedish, respectively - ABL Lights specializes in manufacturing
work lights and driving lights, boasting among its customers all the
major heavy duty utility vehicle makers and railway manufacturers.
ABL Lights has 109 employees and three different locations - Caen
(France), Mosinee (the United States) and China.

Already reviewed by the management teams of ABL Lights and Vignal
Systems for the first time in 2006, the merger of these two European
leaders will accelerate the group’s growth in France and abroad,
leveraging their strong business synergies - highly complementary
product lines, customer portfolios and geographical locations in
Europe, the Unites States and Asia - and open up cross-selling
opportunities with the leading manufacturers of utility, industrial
and commercial vehicles. Both companies have also initiated their
technological switch to LED lighting, which will be a major source of
growth over the next five years.

Activity and highlights

Eurazeo PME purchases Groupe Colisée,
France’s fourth-largest retirement home
operator

On September 30, 2014, Eurazeo PME purchased Groupe Colisée,
France's fourth-largest retirement home operator, based on an
enterprise value of nearly €175 million. The group manages 57
facilities generating €152 million in revenue, plus €38 million from its
Real Estate business. Founded by Patrick Teycheney, Groupe Colisée
currently has nearly 4,000 residents.

Eurazeo PME invested €65 million to become Groupe Colisée’s
majority shareholder, with 64% of the share capital. Christine Jeandel
is the new group Chairman. Bank financing of €170 million was
secured, including €90 million to finance the group’s growth.

This transaction is fully consistent with the priority pillars of Eurazeo’s
selective investment policy, which are based on underlying societal
trends, including longer lifespans. With retirement homes specializing
in “taking care” of dependent elderly persons, it is necessary to offer
tailored and graduated responses in terms of services. In addition,
the group has initiated ambitious development projects in China
alongside first-tier local partners, which led to the signature of a joint
venture agreement in October 2014 with the China Merchant group
for the design, construction and operation of facilities in China.

Eurazeo PME transfers the Gault & Frémont
group to UI Gestion

On December 23, 2014, Eurazeo PME announced the sale of the Gault
& Frémont group, a French leader in the manufacture of packaging
solutions for the bakery, confectioners and catering sectors. This
disposal was completed on February 3, 2015 based on an enterprise
value of €40 million, and for disposal proceeds of €16.3 million for
Eurazeo PME.

Negotiated in conjunction with Gault & Frémont management, this
capital transfer will enable the company to continue its geographic
expansion and strategic diversification within a private equity group,
in line with the strategy implemented since 2008.

4.1.4 EURAZEO CROISSANCE

HICHLICHTS

3SP Group, a Eurazeo Croissance investment,
is placed in administration

On July 21, 2014, 3SP Group was placed in receivership by the
Commercial Court of Evry. Since the flooding in Thailand in
November 2011, which led to the loss of its main product line,
the company has not been able to offset this loss despite the
development of new product ranges. The duration and cost of this
industrial turnaround resulted in the launching of these proceedings,
enabling the sale of the company’s assets and the transfer of a large
number of employees to industrial players. The company was wound-
up on October 21, 2014.

Activities and results of the main subsidiaries and investments

4.2.1 EURAZEO CAPITAL (8 COMPANIES,

70% OF NAV IN 2014)

Accor (equity-accounted)

Record 2014 performance: reflecting strong
momentum in key markets and the pertinence
of the Group’s new strategy

The in-depth transformation being carried out by Accor began to pay
off in 2014: the group posting excellent results in both its businesses,
HotelServices and Hotellnvest.

Group revenue stood at €5,454 million in 2014, up 3.8% on a
comparable basis (constant scope and exchange rates) versus 2013,
and 0.5% on a reported basis. EBIT reached an all-time high of
€602 million, compared with €521 million in 2013, for an increase of
11.7% on a comparable basis. This result generated a record margin of
11.0% (compared with 9.6% at the end of 2013), the upshot of strong
demand in most markets, the implementation of the savings plan and
the first effects of the Hotellnvest portfolio restructuring.

The Accor group's recurring cash flow was robust, standing at
€304 million in 2014. Group net debt amounted to €159 million, down
by €67 million compared with December 31, 2013. The return on
capital employed was up sharply at 14.6% (14.0% in 2013).

In line with its distribution policy of 50% of current earnings per
share, Accor will propose for approval at the Shareholders’ Meeting
of April 28, the payment of a €0.95 dividend per share 100% payable
in cash, or 50% payable in cash and 50% payable in shares with a 5%
discount.

Asmodee (fully consolidated)

2014: a year of transformation for Asmodee

Fiscal year 2014 was marked by ongoing solid organic growth in all
segments and the successful integration of the two transformative
acquisitions - Days of Wonder (DOW) and Fantasy Flight Games
(FFG) - thus accelerating the Group’s development internationally
and in the publishing sector.

Asmodee revenue thus stood at €174.9 million in 2014, up 40.0% on
a reported basis compared with the previous year. Pro forma of the
Group’s two major acquisitions - DOW in July and FFG in December
- revenue stood at €212.0 million on a full-year basis.

The historical scope (excluding DOW and FFG) posted growth of
34.3%, driven by all product lines: Pokémon recorded an outstanding
year, with Group revenue ” of €43.4 million, up 22.9%.

With growth of 32.0% °, the board game core segment (55.0% of
the activity ®) contributed substantially to 2014 earnings. The year’s
performance was driven by the solid results of the current catalogue,
and an ongoing innovation approach, with the successful launch of
several games such as Splendor or Five Tribes. Finally, the subsidiary
Kanai Kids, whose activity is very much oriented towards “trendy
products,” generated €15.0 million with the Cra-Z-loom bracelets.

(1) Revenue and growth before year-end alscounts.

EURAZEO

The Group continues to globalize its activities, reaching in twelve
months the mid-term targets that were set at the time of the
acquisition. With nearly two-thirds of revenue generated outside
France compared with a little less than half in 2013, the greatest
contributors to both revenue and growth are the United Kingdom,
the United States and Benelux.

On a reported basis, Asmodee posted an EBITDA of €21.6 million (an
increase of 170 basis points in the EBITDA margin to 12.3%), up 62.0%
compared with 2013. Pro forma of the full-year acquisitions, EBITDA
would stand at €31.5 million (14.9% of the margin). On a constant
scope basis, EBITDA rose 35.0%.

Finally, net debt amounted to €91.2 million (pro forma leverage
of 2.9x), following draw-downs on new credit facilities in July and
December to finance two external growth transactions.

Desigual (equity-accounted from July 1, 2014)

Solid results and revenue growth in 2014

Revenue for 2014 amounted to €963.5 million, up 16.2%, with more
modest growth in the second half of 2014, reflecting significant
comparatives, particularly mild weather and slumping consumer
spending in Europe.

At 60% and 20% respectively, the women’s and accessories segments
were the main drivers of group revenue and growth during the period.

The five main European countries reported steady growth rates, with
Italy standing out. The other geographical areas, which represent
significant growth vectors for the future development of Desigual,
recorded outstanding performances in 2014. Asia thus posted growth
of 24% in 2014, mainly driven by Japan.

Outside Europe, the deployment strategy for the network of
company-owned stores and franchises, initiated in 2014, targets
major cities in order to extend and bolster the brand. A second phase
covers the linkage with the remaining markets of each country.

Pursuing its multi-channel development strategy, as of
December 31, 2014, Desigual is active in 109 countries and distributed
in 526 stores (company-owned stores and franchises), 200 D-shops,
2,800 “corners” in department stores and 8,000 wholesale points of
sale. The expansion of the range to include new categories extended
the distribution network to 4,500 additional specialized stores. Over
the year, Desigual opened more than 100 new stores (company-
owned stores and franchises), a majority of which in the fourth
quarter of 2014.

EBITDA stood at €261.5 million, up 8.0% compared with 2013,
posting an EBITDA margin of 27.1% (29.2% in 2013), in line with the
anticipated re-investment of the significant 2013 profits for brand and
promotional support in the fourth quarter of 2014.

As of December 31, 2014, the net cash position was positive in the
amount of €223 million.

2014: Solid operational performance, acceleration
of international growth

Elis revenue rose 8.6% on a reported basis and 1.7% in terms of
organic growth, standing at €1,331.0 million in 2014. This increase is
primarily due to the consolidation of the Brazilian acquisitions within
the Group scope, Atmosfera in particular, and the organic growth
generated by the Group in France, Germany and in the Southern
European countries.

In France, the rental and cleaning business rose by 1.3% in 2014,
driven by significant growth in (i) Hotel-Catering (+2.8%) due to the
development of the hospitality business with hotel chains and upscale
hotels. The increase was limited however by a modest occupancy
rate for the Céte d'Azur hotels in July 2014 and by the continuing
decline observed in traditional catering due to the sector’s general
contraction, and (ii) Healthcare (+5.4%), mainly driven by sustained
activity for existing clients and the signature of new contracts for
short stay (hospitals and clinics) and long-stay (retirement home)
clients. The performance of the Industry and Commerce & Service
sectors in 2014 was virtually steady compared with 2013 (respectively
-0.0% and -0.5%).

In Europe, revenue rose by 5.5% in 2014 to €274.3 million, of which
organic growth of 3.5% and a scope impact related to various
acquisitions of +1.6%. In Brazil, Elis generated revenue of €85.3 million
as a result of the February 2014 acquisition of the Atmosfera group
and acquisitions of the “Santa Clara” brand company, L’Acqua and
the assets of Lavtec, respectively in May, July and September 2014.

EBITDA stood at €429.0 million in 2014, up 7.0%, highlighting an
EBITDA margin of 32.2%, compared with 32.7% in 2013, impacted by
property asset disposals and acquisitions in Brazil generating a lower
margin.

Restated for the technical adjustment resulting from the extension
of the textile depreciation period for €9.7 million and rental costs of
€6.3 million, EBIT rose by 6.9% to €210.1 million. On a reported basis,
it declined by 1.2%.

Net debt, which included nearly €100 million in acquisitions
financing, stood at €2,019.1 million at the end of December 2014,
up on December 31, 2013. Leverage stood at 4.7x for the year
ended December 31, 2014 and at less than 3x following the IPO on
February 11, 2015.

Europcar (fully consolidated)

Continuing upsurge in profits and revenue
momentum due to fast lane initiatives

Europcar revenue reached €1,979 million in 2014, up 3.4% at constant
exchange rates. Over the second half, revenue growth from rentals
stood at 5.2%, the increase having accelerated by 4.4% in the third
quarter and 6.5% in the fourth quarter. This performance is the
result of a positive trend in the leisure segment, and a revitalization
of the corporate clients segment. Following several sales team
reorganizations, Europcar has been able to target large account and
SME contracts. Volumes have thus risen by 4.1% in all group countries

and all client segments. At constant exchange rates, Revenue per Day
(RPD) contracted slightly (-0.8%). The decrease is essentially related
to a mix-country impact and specifically the ramp-up of Southern
European countries which contributed decisively to sales growth in
2014 while presenting a lower average RPD to date.

The Fast Lane challenge launched in 2012 has thus been a success
for current management. In addition, Philippe Germond, CEO, and
Cyrille Giraudat, Group Marketing Director, have joined Europcar to
support the teams and to pursue and accelerate this growth. Under
the impetus of the Fast Lane program, they will strive to create new
client offerings using the Europcar and InterRent brands and to
innovate, based on the creation of CRM tools.

The return to an acquisition strategy illustrates the fact that the group
has entered a new phase in its development. For example, Europcar
purchased the Grand-Est Europ Hall franchisee in November 2014
and finalized the acquisition of a majority interest in the company
car-sharing start-up Ubeeqo, announced in January 2015.

Corporate EBITDA rose 35.3% at constant exchange rates, standing
at €213 million compared with €157 million in 2013. The ongoing
optimization of group operations boosted the Corporate EBITDA
margin to 10.8%, an improvement of 2.5% compared with 2013.

Moreover, fleet costs continued to decease: the reduction of monthly
unit costs reached 5.5% in 2014 and the utilization rate rose 0.8 points
to stand at 76.4%.

Europcar net profit was negatively impacted for €141 million in non-
recurring items, including the expenses relating to the successful
refinancings, restructuring costs mainly relating to the set-up of a
shared services center, the impairment of user fees for the National
and Alamo brands, and litigation provisions “.

Corporate net debt at the end of December 2014 amounted to
€581 million, up €56 million year-on-year. Several exceptional events
over the period impacted the company’s debt position, including
acquisition costs, the fleet refinancing in August 2014 for €25 million,
and the transformation investments.

In July 2014, Europcar successfully refinanced its fleet bond issue,
extending its maturity to 2021 and reducing its cost from 9.75% to
5.125%. In addition, the £425 million in financing for the British fleet
was renegotiated in October 2014.

Leverage decreased significantly to 2.7x Corporate EBITDA, for the
year ended December 31, 2014, compared with 3.4x for the year
ended December 31, 2013.

Eurazeo has confirmed its intention to list Europcar. Depending on
market conditions, this transaction could take place before the end
of the first-half of 2015.

Foncia (equity-accounted)

Achievement of the “Cap Zero” objective - Steady
increase in EBITDA spurred by revenue growth in
a difficult market

Foncia reported revenue of €641 million in 2014, up 7.7% on a
reported basis and 1.2% excluding the acquisitions of Tagerim and
Trévi (Belgium).

(1) Pursuant to IFRS, only current proceedings and litigation, whose financial risk can be assessed, are provided in the Group financial statements for the year ended

O4 OVERVIEW OF THE FISCAL YEAR

Activities and results of the main subsidiaries and investments

Foncia achieved for the first year the “Cap Zero” objective in both
joint property management and lease management activities in 2014:
Foncia reported organic growth in terms of the number of plots
managed. This performance confirms that the initiatives undertaken
to boost sales resulting in the set-up of teams dedicated to winning
new clients as well as the measures adopted in agencies based on
the feedback from client satisfaction analyses have begun to produce
results.

Despite the impact of the ALUR law (Joi pour I’Accés au Logement
et un Urbanisme Rénové, ensuring access to housing and renewed
urban-planning measures), the transactions activity - the principal
business concerned in 2014 (extended periods between offers and
undertakings to sell) - continued to improve with a 1.6% improvement
compared with 2013.

Group EBITDA totaled €125 million, up 22.0% on a reported basis
compared with 2013 and 10.9% excluding the acquisitions of Tagerim
and Trévi, ie. a 230 basis point margin improvement on a reported
basis.

Net debt stood at €420 million for the year ended December 31, 2014,
down 2.7% compared with December 31, 2013, despite the acquisitions
and the buyback of 1.89% of the Foncia Group shares held by BPCE.

Furthermore, Foncia is now working to refinance the buyback of
BPCE's investment finalized in November 2014 by setting up a new
senior debt tranche of €190 million that should be effective in the
second quarter of 2015. Foncia will therefore regain a leverage of
4.9x, in line with the 2011 acquisition leverage.

As of December 31, 2014, Foncia fully consolidated Tagerim, whose
acquisition was finalized in September 2013. Foncia has continued
to develop its digital offering, particularly through two of its external
growth transactions: Efficity (property development website
designed to identify new prospects for the transaction activity) and
Primalliance (platform of advisors specializing in real estate fund
investment), in addition to Syndic+ acquired in 2012.

Moncler (equity-accounted)

Sound revenue growth in 2014

Moncler continued to post strong revenue growth in 2014. Rising by
20% on a reported basis compared with 2013, revenue amounted to
€694 million (+21% at constant exchange rates).

Moncler recorded double-digit growth in all its international markets.
At constant exchange rates, the Americas reported growth of +42%,
Asia +35% and Europe and the Middle East +16%. Italy posted revenue
in line with the previous year, with the company-owned store network
offsetting the performance of wholesale outlets.

Company-owned store sales represented 62% of brand revenue
in 2014, compared with 57% in 2013, up 31% at constant exchange
rates, amounting to €430.7 million in 2014 (€333.6 million in 2013).
This performance was driven by growth at existing stores and the
development of the company-owned store network.

Comparable sales of company-owned stores amounted to 8% in
2014, accelerating in the fourth quarter. Moncler’s network consisted
of 172 stores at December 31, 2014, including 134 company-owned
stores, up by 27 compared with December 31, 2013, and 38 Shops-in-
Shops, up by 10 compared with December 31, 2013.

Sales in the wholesale channel rose by 7% at current and constant
exchange rates, driven by North America and Korea and despite the
planned reduction in wholesale stores and the conversion of two
wholesale stores into company-owned stores.

Adjusted EBITDA © rose by €232.9 million, compared with
€191.7 million in 2013 and EBITDA margin increased to 33.5% of sales
compared with 33.0% in 2013.

Net financial debt at December 31, 2014 was €111.2 million, compared
with €1711 million at December 31, 2013.

Moncler has resolved to propose a dividend of €0.12 per share,
representing a payout ratio of 23%.

Appointment of Roberto Eggs as Group COO
of Moncler

Roberto Eggs has been appointed as Deputy CEO of Moncler. He will
report to Remo Ruffini, Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
and assume his duties as of May 1, 2015. Roberto Eggs has worked
at LVMH as Chairman of the Southern Europe and Northern Europe
regions since 2009 and of the Europe/Middle East, India and Africa
region since 2013. He started out in international marketing at Nestlé
in 1992.

ANF Immobilier (fully consolidated)

Above-target growth in rents and change
in governance

On March 3, 2015, the Supervisory Board decided to appoint Renaud
Haberkorn as Chairman of the Executive Board, effective May 6, 2015,
the date of the next Shareholders’ Meeting. He will replace Bruno
Keller who contributed ten years to developing and transforming
ANF Immobilier from an asset-holding entity into a leading real
estate investment company in regional cities. The appointment of
Bruno Keller as a member of the ANF Immobilier Supervisory Board
will be submitted for approval to the next Shareholders’ Meeting on
May 6, 2015.

Over the full year, ANF Immobilier outperformed its growth objectives
in terms of rental income, reaching €40.1 million, up significantly by
15% and 18% based on a scope restated for disposals, thus surpassing
the +12% forecast. Portfolio revenues were mainly generated by the
leasing of offices (34%), stores (31%) and hotels (12%). Housing now
only represents 18% of rents.

Recurring EBITDA rose by 25% to €27.0 million, mainly through
new acquisitions and deliveries in the tertiary real estate market.
Current cash flow increased to €14.8 million, or €0.82 per share.
The appraisal value determined by two independent experts totaled
€1,107 million, excluding fees, up 14% compared with the end of 2013.
As of December 31, 2014, the Net Asset Value stood at €29.7 per
share, according to the EPRA method. Excluding the dividend, this
change represents a 4.3% decline, mainly resulting from the negative
adjustments in the regulatory conditions governing the market (Pinel
law and increase in registration fees) and the Marseilles residential
market.

(1) EBITDA before non-recurring costs: non-cash costs of €5.0 million mainly related to stock option plans in FY 2014 and IPO costs of €6.1 million in FY 2013.

O4 OVERVIEW OF THE FISCAL YEAR

Activities and results of the main subsidiaries and investments

2014 was marked by the accelerated transformation of ANF
Immobilier, with a substantial increase in secured pipeline volumes
which amounted to €462 million (€282 million attributable to owners
of the Company) at the end of 2014, compared with €230 million
(€182 million attributable to owners of the Company) at the end of
2013. This sharp increase was attributable to major new investments,
which marked a rebalancing in the property portfolio: geographically,
they represent 57% for Lyon, 32% for Bordeaux and 11% for Marseille,
and, in terms of property type, 85% for offices, 11% for hotels and 4%
for stores.

ANF Immobilier has fulfilled its strategic plan, whose objective at
the start of 2013 was a doubling of rents over the medium term. By
targeting high-potential regional cities and refocusing on tertiary real
estate and optimized value creation, ANF Immobilier has enhanced
its profile as the leading real estate investment firm in regions. For
2015, ANF Immobilier forecasts a 12% increase in its gross rents.

4.2.3. EURAZEO PME (7 PORTFOLIO
COMPANIES, 7% OF NAV)

Two acquisitions, eight build-ups and two
disposals

During the year, two acquisitions were completed, Vignal Lighting
Group, European leader in signaling lights for industrial and
commercial vehicles in February, and Colisée Patrimoine, France's
fourth-largest retirement home operator, in September.

In addition, with the assistance of Eurazeo PME, the portfolio
companies carried out eight external growth transactions:

¢ Péters Surgical, the world number four in surgical suture, acquired
Vitalitec (European leader in hemostatic surgical clamps) and
Fimed (a surgical adhesive and mash manufacturer) in April, then
Stéricat, surgical suture specialist in India, in December. These
acquisitions enabled Péters Surgical to strengthen its position as
surgical suture specialist, with an extended range of products;

¢@ Vignal Systems merged two months after its acquisition by
Eurazeo PME with ABL Lights, number two in Europe and the
United States in work lights for off-road vehicles (construction,
mining, agricultural, forestry in particular), with offices in France,
USA and China. The merger of these two leaders within the Vignal
Lighting Group will accelerate international growth due to the
close commercial synergies and start of the LED technological
shift which is a major growth engine for future years;

¢@ Cap Vert Finance, specializing in maintenance, repair and
operations (MRO) of fleets of servers, storage and networking,
acquired three companies, Aditia Lease and DCS (operating in the
Italian market), and Phoenix Services. The group is now present in
over 100 countries. These transactions will strengthen its position
as the European leader in computer recycling through life-cycle-
management of IT infrastructures;

130 EURAZEO

¢ Groupe Colisée integrated the Asclépios Group with 11 senior-
assisted living facilities (eight in operation and three planned).
Groupe Colisée also signed a joint venture agreement with a
Chinese partner for the design and operation of retirement homes
in China
Finally, Dessange International acquired two US regional Fantastic
Sams master franchises (Michigan and Kansas regions), representing
a total of 124 salons out of 1,140 Fantastic Sams and Camille Albane
salons in the United States. A total of 62% of Fantastic Sams salons
are now operated as direct franchises, compared with 31% at the time
of the acquisition in 2011.

Overall, Eurazeo PME invested €130 million during the year to finance
acquisitions and the growth of investments.

Eurazeo PME sold its minority investment in IMV Technologies, world
leader in animal reproduction biotechnologies and Gault & Frémont.

As of December 31, 2014, the portfolio was valued at €350 million,
compared with €218 million as of December 31, 2013. This
improvement is attributable to the increase in the portfolio valuation
for €33 million and additional investments for €130 million, less partial
disposals and repayments of the bonds subscribed by Eurazeo PME
in its portfolio for €31 million.

Business growth and a good EBITDA
performance for portfolio companies

Revenue for the year totaled €482.1 million, up 11.7% on a restated
basis (restatement in 2013 for the changes relating to the five
acquisitions in 2013 and 2014, and the sale of The Flexitallic Group
in July 2013).

Groupe Colisée, consolidated since October 1, 2014, reported organic
growth of 4%. Cap Vert Finance's revenue increased sharply (+26%),
following the integration of the build-up operations and substantial
organic growth, primarily attributable to the signing of new contracts
with major clients in the maintenance activity. Vignal Lighting Group
reported revenue growth, as did Péters Surgical, excluding the
calendar effects of an export contract. The Dessange International
Group also recorded business growth, particularly in the United
States. Léon de Bruxelles Group revenue was stable over the year,
with the inauguration of six new restaurants.

The consolidated EBITDA of the investments amounted to
€679 million in 2014, compared with €62.4 million in 2013 on a
comparable Eurazeo PME scope basis, i.e. a 8.8% increase. The
EBITDA margin rate was stable at 14.1%. This improvement was due to
a commendable performance from all group companies.

As of December 31, 2014, the consolidated net debt of the investments
totaled €267 million, representing a senior leverage of 2.4x their
EBITDA over 12 months.

The senior and mezzanine debts of the Dessange and Léon de
Bruxelles groups were successfully refinanced during the year. For
both these groups, these new financing arrangements (banking
transaction for Dessange International and single tranche for Léon
de Bruxelles) contributed to funding their growth and reducing their
costs.

4.2.4 EURAZEO CROISSANCE
(3 COMPANIES, 2% OF NAV)

Development and revenue growth

The operating income of Fonroche rose by 58% in 2014 to €98 million,
due to the very steady construction of photovoltaic greenhouses and
farms in France, which resulted in greenhouse commissioning of 22
MWc. Fonroche also gained 36 MWc from its latest French tenders for
photovoltaic installations. The group is one of the largest tenderers in
terms of volume, thus demonstrating its ability to develop large-scale
competitive projects.

Fonroche launched the construction of its first anaerobic digestion
facility in Villeneuve-sur-Lot (47). Air Liquide’s investment in
Fonroche’s subsidiary specializing in biogas has enabled both groups
to pool their expertise in order to develop, as a partnership, biogas
purification and upgrading projects for the French market. Finally,
Fonroche continued to develop its geothermal energy business,
having obtained nine exclusive mining permits to date.

The pro forma revenue of IES Synergy rose by 24% compared with
2013, driven by the development of fast external charging, which
is key to supporting the market take-off for both urban use and

medium and long-distance travel. IES Synergy signed several major
sales agreements with BMW, Bosch, Volkswagen and Wanma (a
major infrastructure player in China). The company was also elected
the exclusive supplier of fast charging terminals for Formula-E, the
world’s first fully-electric Formula 1 racing championship and module
supplier for fast-charging terminals in Paris. This partnership confirms
the unique technological know-how of IES Synergy and strengthens
its international visibility. 2014 was also marked by the opening of
three subsidiaries (United States, China, and Germany) and a sales
office in Canada

Finally, in March 2015, IES Synergy announced the appointment
of Jean-Michel Cornille as Chairman of the Executive Board. Jean-
Michel Cornille is a graduate of the Ecole Polytechnique and the Ecole
Nationale des Ponts et Chaussée engineering schools. He has spent
most of his career working in the telecoms and electronics industry
and has held management positions in major international groups
such as Alcatel, Areva T&D or Alstom.

In 2014, I-Pulse accelerated its growth, particularly with the signing
of a major contract to create innovative packaging with a key player
in the luxury goods sector. In the mining business, its Toronto-listed
subsidiary Kaizen signed a partnership agreement with the Japanese
group Itochu, which invested US$5 million in Kaizen and will also
finance future projects.

4.3 CROSSING OF OWNERSHIP THRESHOLDS
(ARTICLE L. 233-6 OF THE FRENCH COMMERCIAL

SUCCESSFUL IPO OF ELIS

Eurazeo successfully completed the IPO of Elis on the regulated
Euronext Paris market on February 11, 2015. The issue price was set
at €13.00 per share. Under the transaction, essentially comprising
the issue of new shares for a gross amount of €700 million, LH 27,
a company controlled by Eurazeo, initially sold 3.6 million shares (or
3.20% of the share capital post IPO) and realized disposal proceeds
of approximately €47.4 million. The number of shares was increased
to 11.7 million following the exercise of the over-allotment option by
the banks (10.2% of capital), thus raising the disposal proceeds to
€152 million (€125 million net of costs for Eurazeo).

Following the IPO, Eurazeo’s economic holding amounted to 35.1% of
the Company's share capital.

START OF EXCLUSIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH
UNION INVIVO

On March 30, 2015, Eurazeo announced that it had signed an
agreement with Union InVivo to purchase a minority interest as
part of a capital increase involving InVivo NSA (Nutrition et Santé
Animales) intended to finance its growth plan.

This transaction should take place at the start of the second quarter
of 2015. Eurazeo would invest €114 million for a 17.3% interest,
corresponding to an enterprise value of €729 million.

InVivo NSA ranks among the world leaders in the animal nutrition and
health sector. The French player has five business lines: complete feed
(including domestic animals), firm-services and premix, additives,
animal health, and laboratories, and boasts a worldwide presence,
particularly in high-potential regions such as Brazil, Mexico and Asia.
For the year ended December 31, 2014, the company generated (pro
forma of its recent acquisitions) revenue of €1,443 million and an
EBITDA of €83.4 million.

SUCCESSFUL FUNDRAISING FOR
EURAZEO PME

Eurazeo PME raised €156 million from French and international
institutional investors. These funds will be co-invested with Eurazeo.

A total of €212 million has already been invested in five companies
and eight build-ups.

This fundraising, which will enable Eurazeo PME to complete its
investment capacity, demonstrates the avid interest in Eurazeo PME’s
investment strategy and the high quality of its portfolio.

The transaction was completed on March 25, 2015.

EURAZEO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES
THE SALE OF NEARLY HALF ITS
INVESTMENT IN ACCOR

On March 25, 2015, Eurazeo sold through its subsidiary, Legendre

O4 OVERVIEW OF THE FISCAL YEAR

Net Asset Value

4.5.3 METHODOLOCY

Net Asset Value (NAV) is determined based on net equity as
presented in the Eurazeo company financial statements , adjusted
to include investments at their estimated fair value in accordance
with the recommendations set out in the International Private Equity
Valuation Guidelines ® (IPEV).

Pursuant to these recommendations, which propose a multi-criteria
approach, the preferred method for valuing Eurazeo's unlisted
investments is based on comparable multiples (stock market
capitalization or transactions) applied to earnings figures taken from
the income statement.

This valuation approach requires the exercise of judgment, particularly
in the following areas:

¢@ in order to ensure the relevance of the approach, samples
of comparables are stable over time and include companies
presenting characteristics as close as possible to our investments,
particularly with respect to their business and market position;
where appropriate, these samples may be adjusted to reflect the
most relevant comparables;

@ the earnings to which multiples are applied to obtain the
enterprise value are primarily operating income, EBIT, gross
operating income or EBITDA. The multiples are applied to data
taken from the historical accounts (preferred method) ® or
alternatively forecast accounts for the coming year where these
contribute additional, relevant information;

¢ the value of each investment is then obtained by subtracting the
following amounts from the enterprise value, determined after
adjustment, where applicable, for a control premium applied
to equity (i) historical or forecast net debt at nominal value, as
appropriate, (ii) a discount for liquidity, where applicable and
(iii) the amount payable, where applicable, to other investors
according to their rank and investment managers.

When the comparables method cannot be applied, other valuation
methods are adopted, such as the Discounted Cash Flow method.

As of December 31, 2014, the values adopted for Europcar Groupe,
Gruppo Banca Leonardo, Foncia, Fonroche, |-Pulse and IES
were subject to detailed review by an independent professional
appraiser, Sorgem Evaluation “. This review concluded that the
values adopted are reasonable and prepared in accordance with a
valuation methodology in accordance with IPEV recommendations.
Exceptionally, the Elis valuation as of December 31, 2014 was
determined based on the issue price for the February 1, 2015 IPO.
of €13 per share. Recent investments (Asmodee, Desigual, Groupe
Colisée, Vignal Lighting Group) are valued at acquisition cost.

Listed investments “ (listed investments and other listed assets) are
valued based on the average, over the 20 days preceding the valuation
date, of average daily share prices weighted for trading volumes.
As the liquidity of the shares concerned is satisfactory, neither a
discount nor a premium is applied to the share prices adopted.
Where the shares are held through a company that secured debt
specifically to finance the investment, the transparent amount, net
of borrowings secured by the holding company carrying the shares,
is taken into account in the NAV. In the specific case of Moncler, the
average share price as of December 31, 2013 was determined from
December 16, 2013 (the date of the IPO), i.e. over 8 trading sessions.

Real Estate investments are valued as follows, at the valuation date:
(i) for ANF Immobilier, in a similar way to listed investments, that is
based on the share price (20-day average of weighted daily average
share prices), (ii) for investment funds (Colyzeo and Colyzeo 2), based
‘on the most recent information communicated by fund managers.

Net cash and cash equivalents “ and Eurazeo treasury shares are
valued at the valuation date. Treasury shares allocated to share
purchase option plans are valued at the lower of the closing price
and the strike price.

Net Asset Value is reported after adjustment for the taxation of
unrealized capital gains and invested capital likely to be due to
management teams. The number of shares is the number of shares
comprising the Eurazeo share capital less any treasury shares
earmarked for cancellation.

(1) Including, by transparency up to operating company level, the assets and llabilties of holding companies and intermediary funds controlled by Eurazeo and the structures
carrying the co-investment programs for management and Eurazeo teams.

(2) These recommendations are recognized by the majority of private equity associations around the world, and particularly AFIC in France, and are applied by numerous
funds. They may be consulted at the following internet address: http://www. privateequityvaluation.com.

(3) Consolidated financial statements of each investment used to prepare the Eurazeo IFRS consolidated financial statements, before impairment of goodwill and amortization
of intangible assets recognized on business combinations. Figures are adjusted, where appropriate, for non-recurring items.

(4) Inaccordance with the terms of its engagement, Sorgem Evaluation based its opinion on a comparison of values adopted by Eurazeo with a range of estimates obtained
using the valuation methods considered most pertinent. The procedures performed by Sorgem Evaluation were based on () information communicated by Eurazeo,
primarily business plans and available forecast data and (i) publicly available information:

(6) Listed investments comprise investments in listed companies in which Eurazeo exercises control or significant influence. This is not the case for other listed securities.
(6) Cash and cash equivalents net of other assets and operating liabilties of Eurazeo, at their net carrying amount.

Net Asset Value

4.5.4 STATEMENT BY THE STATUTORY AUDITORS RECARDINC EURAZEO’S NET ASSET
VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 3l, 2014

This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors’ report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English-
speaking readers. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing
standards applicable in France.

To the Chairman of the Executive Board,

In our capacity as Statutory Auditors of Eurazeo and pursuant to your request, we have verified the financial information relating to Eurazeo’s
Net Asset Value (hereafter “Net Asset Value”) as of December 31, 2014 (hereafter the “Information”) given in the 2014 management report
(hereafter the “Management report”) and prepared in accordance with the International Private Equity Valuation Guidelines.

The Net Asset Value has been prepared under the responsibility of Eurazeo’s Executive Board based on the accounting records of Eurazeo and
of the fully consolidated subsidiaries, as well as on available market data as of December 31, 2014. The method of calculation of the Net Asset
Value and the assumptions adopted are described in section 4.5 of the Management report.

Our role is to comment as to:

¢ whether the Information used for the calculation of the Net Asset Value is consistent with the accounting records and;
¢ whether the preparation of the Information complies in all material respects with the methodology described in section 4.5.3 of the
Management report.

We are not however required to call into question the methodology, the assumptions used and the judgments made by Eurazeo’s management to
determine the fair values of its investments in unlisted companies. Nor are we required to comment on the compliance of this methodology with
a set of standards or best practices, or to comment on the values thus determined for each investment within the context of the Net Asset Value.

In our capacity as Statutory Auditors, we have audited the annual and consolidated financial statements of Eurazeo for the year ended
December 31, 2014.

The purpose of our audit, performed in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France, was to express an opinion on the
parent company and consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and not on specific elements of these financial statements used for the
calculation of the Net Asset Value. Consequently, we did not perform our audit tests and sample testing with this aim and we do not express any
opinion on these elements taken separately.

We performed our work in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France. For the purposes of this report, our work consisted in:

¢@ Familiarizing ourselves with the procedures set up by your Company to produce the Information relating to the Net Asset Value;
Comparing the methods applied to calculate the Net Asset Value with those described in part 4.5.3 of the Management report for 2014;
¢ Verifying the consistency of the accounting net assets of Eurazeo and its subsidiaries holding the investments used to calculate the Net Asset

Value with the annual financial statements of Eurazeo for the year ended December 31, 2014;
¢ Verifying the consistency of the accounting information used to calculate the Net Asset Value with the elements used as a basis for preparing

the consolidated financial statements of Eurazeo for the year ended December 31, 2014, notably:

+ in situations where the fair value has been determined by applying multiples to aggregates taken from the accounting records or
provisional accounts of investments, verifying the consistency of these aggregates with the accounting records or the provisional accounts
of investments,
in situations where the fair value has been determined by applying multiples to aggregates taken from the accounting records and
adjusted for non-recurring items, verifying the consistency of these aggregates with the accounting records before these adjustments are
taken into account,

« in situations where fair value has been determined by applying multiples to aggregates taken from forecast accounts of investments,
reconciling these forecast aggregates with items used by Eurazeo for impairments tests in preparing the consolidated financial statements,

« in situations where debt items have been used to calculate the fair value of unlisted investments, verifying the consistency of the debt
items with the accounting records, except when prospective items have been used;

¢ Verifying the consistency of the share price used to calculate the fair value of listed investments with observable data;
¢ Verifying the arithmetical accuracy of the calculations after application of rounding rules, if necessary.

Based on our work, we have no matters to report on the consistency of the accounting information used in the calculation of Eurazeo's Net Asset
Value with the accounting records and on the compliance of their calculation with the methodology described part 4.5.3 of the Management
report for 2014.

.

This statement has been prepared for your attention in the context described above and must not be used, distributed or referred to for any
other purpose.

The work performed in the framework of this statement is not designed to replace the inquiries and other procedures that third parties with
knowledge of this statement may need to perform and we express no opinion as to the adequacy of our work for the purposes of such third
parties.

O4 OVERVIEW OF THE FISCAL YEAR

Eurazeo consolidated earnings

Recurring net income

Eurazeo group consolidated investments reported total adjusted
EBIT of €607.2 million, up 11.3% on 2013 pro forma of acquisitions and
disposals between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2014.

Europcar EBIT increased remarkably by €471 million or 18.1%,
thanks to the ongoing implementation of the Fast Lane profitability
improvement program focusing both on improving sales and good
cost management.

Restated by €9.7 million for the adjustment resulting from the
extension of the textile depreciation period, Elis EBIT rose €7.2 million,
or close to 3.6%. This increase is due to both the acquisition of
Atmosfera in Brazil (€5.3 million in 2014) and organic earnings growth.

Eurazeo PME EBIT increased €4.3 million, primarily due to build-ups
in 2014 by the Péters, Cap Vert Finance and Vignal investments.

Adjusted EBIT of consolidated investments net of finance costs
increased €54.0 million.

The share of income of associates net of finance costs increased
€22.7 million, reflecting the decrease in Accor net finance costs and
the operating performance of Accor and Moncler in particular: Accor
reported a 15.6% increase in EBIT to €602 million and Moncler a 21%
increase in EBITDA to €233 million.

Overall, the contribution of companies net of finance costs totaled
€230.9 million, up 49.8% on 2013, pro forma of changes in Group
structure.

In addition to these activity results, Eurazeo reported recurring
results in respect of capital gains on asset disposals net of related
impairment. Capital gains of €75.2 million were recognized in 2014,
including primarily €29.2 million for Intercos, €10.2 million for the
Colyzeo funds and €8.0 million for Rexel. 2013 was marked by major
divestments: Edenred, Moncler and Rexel by Eurazeo Capital and The
Flexitallic Group by Eurazeo PME.

Eurazeo group recurring net income is €170.9 million in 2014.

138 EURAZEO

Non recurring items

Group non-recurring items represent a net expense of €283.7 million
in 2014 and primarily concern Europcar in the amount of
-€141.4 million, Elis in the amount of -€53.0 million, the write-off of
3SP in our accounts in the amount of -€40.5 million, Fonroche in the
amount of -€10.5 million and Accor in the amount of -€16.3 million.
The remaining balance comprises immaterial individual amounts
spread across the Group portfolio.

Europcar non-recurring items primarily comprise expenses relating to
the successful refinancings, restructuring costs mainly relating to the
set-up of a shared services center, the impairment of right of use for
the National and Alamo brands, and litigation provisions.

As disclosed in Note 14.3 to the consolidated financial statements,
some provisions concern several claims for damages to which the
Europcar Group is exposed as a result of two legal proceedings with
the Enterprise group, certain of which are provided in its financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2014. A provision
was not recognized as of December 31, 2014 in respect of other
claims for damages following the arbitration decision at the end of
December 2014 in favor of Enterprise, as the amount of potential
damages, which could be material at Europcar level, cannot be
reasonably estimated at this time.

Furthermore, on February 17, 2015, the Competition Authorities issued
a statement of grievances to Europcar France and other stakeholders,
accusing them of certain practices potentially non-compliant with
French regulations. Europcar has a period of two months to present
its observations in response. Should a procedure be initiated by the
Competition Authorities, the Europcar group will be exposed to a
risk of a fine of an amount potentially material at Europcar level. The
amount of any fine that could be paid by the group in respect of facts
of which it could be found guilty cannot be assessed at the current
stage of proceedings. Accordingly, the Group has not recognized a
provision in this respect as of December 31, 2014.

O4 OVERVIEW OF THE FISCAL YEAR

Eurazeo consolidated earnings

Eurazeo Capital subsidiaries continued their investment efforts
in 2014 and even strengthened such efforts in the case of Elis,
which increased its textile investments notably in response to new
client contracts signed by the company. Purchases of investment
properties totaled €190.4 million in 2014: ANF Immobilier continued
the renovation of its real estate assets in Marseilles and invested in
new projects in Lyons, Bordeaux and Marseilles.

The Elis group performed several sale and lease-back transactions
in the first half of 2014 concerning the land and buildings at 22 sites,
representing a total amount of €92.9 million.

Proceeds from sales of investments and available-for-sale financial
assets primarily concern the sale of Intercos shares (€58.4 million,
including €21.8 million received during the year) and the sale of Rexel
shares (€427.3 million).

Changes in the financial position of Eurazeo group are presented below:

The impact of changes in consolidation scope primarily reflects the
entry into the consolidation scope of Asmodee and Atmosfera.

(€3.5 million), Moncler (€5.8 million) and Accor (€18.4 million).

Net cash flows from financing activities include the cash portion of
the dividend distribution by Eurazeo SA of €42.9 million.

The refinancing of the ANF Immobilier debt generated loan
repayments of €323 million and proceeds from new borrowings of
€496 million.
