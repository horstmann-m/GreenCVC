Market development

Significant economic recovery after historic recession

After the vaccination campaigns had gained momentum in the spring of 2021, and COVID-19 infection rates began to decline,
the business restrictions, which were tightened again towards the end of 2020, could be eased. This was accompanied by an
economic upturn in the summer months. Though, supply bottlenecks weighed heavily on the industrial sector over the course of
the year. Inflation rates reached multi-year highs, largely due to increased energy prices and supply chain problems. However,
there was a renewed sharp rise in infection rates towards the end of the year. The restrictions subsequently reintroduced in
many countries weighed on the economy in the final quarter of the year, albeit probably not to the same extent as in the previ-
ous year.

The gross domestic product of the euro area increased by around 5 per cent in 2021. The strong growth was marked by large
fluctuations during the year. At the beginning of the year, the economy was in recession. The rebound in the second and third
quarters pushed quarter-on-quarter growth rates to above 2 per cent. In the final quarter of the year, however, momentum
again slowed significantly. In contrast, the inflation rate showed a steady upward trend. While year-on-year inflation was still
minus 0.3 per cent in December 2020, the consumer price index showed an increase of 5 per cent at the end of 2021.

The monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) ensured that money market rates (Euribor) remained closely aligned
with the ECB deposit rate of minus 0.5 per cent in 2021. In March, the ECB responded to an unwelcome rise in long-term interest
rates by increasing the monthly volume of bond purchases. It reduced the volume again somewhat in the fourth quarter. To-
wards the end of the year, the previously increased expectations of interest rate hikes declined moderately in light of renewed
uncertainty relating to the pandemic. The ECB continued its large-volume asset purchase program, mainly government bonds,
consolidating the dampening effects on capital market interest rates in the euro area.

The Austrian economy continued to be affected by restrictions on account of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2021. How-
ever, following the lifting of restrictions, a visible economic upturn set in during the second and third quarters that was
stronger than in the euro area. In contrast to Germany, the industrial sector supported the economy into the autumn despite
supply bottlenecks. However, a new lockdown was imposed at the end of November in response to sharply rising infections,
which weighed heavily on the economy in the final quarter. Nevertheless, GDP for the entire 2021 year recorded an increase of
just under 5 per cent (2020: decrease 6.7 per cent).

CEE: Pressure on central banks to act due to inflation
surge

The CEE region also saw a significant rise in inflation rates in 2021. This reflected not only rising energy prices but also supply
chain issues and the accompanying effects of the economic recovery (pent-up consumer demand and high investment). Infla-
tionary pressure was strongest in Central and Eastern Europe, where price increases averaged 4.5 and 7.0 per cent p.a., respec-
tively. In contrast, the average inflation rate in Southeastern Europe was just 4.0 per cent p.a. Price pressures are expected to
ease somewhat by the end of 2022, albeit depending more on the global rather than local conditions, including supply bottle-
necks and energy prices. A substantial tightening of monetary policy was observed in Central and Eastern Europe over the
course of 2021. This was against the backdrop of less well-anchored inflation expectations than in Western countries, tradition-
ally stronger correlations between producer and consumer prices, and the devaluation of local currencies. Particularly strong
interest rate hikes by individual central banks (such as in the Czech Republic, Hungary or Russia), placed increased pressure on
other central banks in the region - with a comparable environment - to take similar action. Moreover, use of unconventional
monetary policy instruments and asset purchases in the CEE region has been limited to immediate crisis situations or already
scaled back. Capital market interest rates are therefore not dampened by long-running asset purchases such as in the euro
area.

The economies in Central Europe (CE) posted a strong recovery in 2021. As a result, many countries had already returned to pre-
pandemic GDP levels by the second half of 2021. The main drivers of the economic upturn proved to be foreign demand, private
consumption as well as investment, with fiscal policy also having a supportive effect. However, due to manufacturing making
up a large share of their economies, the countries of the CE region were particularly impacted by disruptions in global supply
chains. Political disagreements delayed the disbursement of EU funds for Poland and Hungary; however, this is not expected to
change the economic outlook for these countries.

With an increase of 6.5 per cent in 2021, the economy in Southeastern Europe (SEE), saw a major rebound from the pandemic-
induced slump of the previous year. This was due not least to the recovery of private consumption, which was supported by the
resurgence of remittances in many countries (e.g. Albania, Kosovo) and the stronger-than-expected tourist season (e.g. Albania,
Croatia). Most countries in the region reached pre-pandemic GDP levels earlier than elsewhere. However, the economic recovery
in Bulgaria was comparatively moderate, which is related to the greater impact of the pandemic.

Eastern Europe (EE) recorded only moderate GDP growth in 2021, compared to CE and SEE. However, this should also be seen in
context of the less drastic economic slump in 2020. In Belarus, as the effects of the newly imposed sanctions had not yet fully
materialized, they did not severely impact the economy in 2021 (GDP increase: 17 per cent). In Ukraine, cooperation with the IMF
continued to be difficult, but support was ultimately secured through an agreement. Russia's economy was supported by fiscal
policy, rising oil and gas prices, strong consumer demand as well as industrial production, while the agricultural sector had a
dampening effect.

Banking sector in Austria

Austrian banks' return on assets recovered significantly in 2021, toward the pre-pandemic level of 0.7 per cent. This was the
result of a decline in risk costs, an improvement in fee and commission income, and a recovery in the profitability of large
CE/SEE subsidiaries. Despite expiring loan repayment moratoriums, credit risks in the banking system remained subdued and
the NPL ratio fell to below 1.5 per cent (Austrian loan portfolio). This was supported by brisk lending in a favorable funding envi-
ronment, including access to the euro system's TLTROs. The volume of both retail and corporate loans reached growth rates of
around 5 per cent p.a. during 2021, with raised demand for housing loans and recovery in corporate investment being key driv-
ers. Despite the observed balance sheet growth, regulatory oversight of the banks’ capital allocation helped maintain the
strong capital position of Austrian banks with a CET1 ratio of 16 per cent.

Development of the banking sector in CEE

In course of the general economic recovery, which aided a decline in risk costs and a normalization of lending, CEE banks had a
strong recovery in 2021. Despite the renewed uptick in COVID-19 cases at the end of the year, the EE banks' return on equity was
above 20 per cent and reached solid levels of between 10 to 13 per cent in CE/SEE. The revival of personal loans complemented
the stable mortgage lending segment, while lending to businesses eventually also gained momentum as the investment cycle
picked up steam. Government support measures kept NPL ratios low, though banks’ Stage 2 loans still present some degree of
unresolved credit risk. In some countries, Stage 2 loans remained particularly high at 15 to 20 per cent (Romania, Slovakia), while
fluctuating around 10 per cent in many others. With inflationary pressures mounting, monetary tightening became one of the
main issues, particularly in Russia, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. The increase in interest rates has so far
proved favorable for the banks’ net interest margins, which showed signs of bottoming out in CE/SEE.

Regulatory environment
ECB supervisory priorities for banks under Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)

= Credit risk managment: The ECB expected the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting deterioration of the macroeconomic
environment to have a negative impact on banks' asset quality. Noting that support measures, including monetary actions,
as well as fiscal, regulatory and supervisory measures, have managed to avert a new financial crisis as intended. The ECB
focused its banking supervisory efforts on assessing the adequacy of banks' credit risk management, as well as of their
operations, monitoring and reporting.

= Capital strength: Elevated credit risk combined with potential market adjustments may lead to the deterioration of banks’
capital ratios. The ECB highlighted the necessity of sound capital planning that is based on capital projections and adapta-
ble to a rapidly changing environment, especially during a crisis situation.

= Business model sustainability: Profitability and banks’ business model sustainability remained a key concern. The supervisory
authorities placed particular focus on banks' digital transformation processes.

= Governance: The ECB sees strong governance by management bodies as an essential driver in overcoming a crisis. Govern-
ance and crisis risk management frameworks were therefore closely monitored. Further focus areas included banks' risk
data aggregation capabilities, IT and cyber risk management practices and governance, as well as on controlling risks aris-
ing from outsourcing services to third parties, money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

New regulations in 2021
Finalization of Basel Ill (CRR Ill / CRD VI)

The CRR Ill / CRD VI package (Basel IV) transposes the global standards bank capital (Basel III framework) into European law. It is
based on the proposals of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision. The chief focus is on the results of internal models,
which had allowed for varying degrees of capital requirements in the past. This (heterogeneity) should no longer be possible.

RBI as a universal bank is affected by the framework in various respects, though sees the regulation as a big opportunity for
itself and its customers. Aspects like the expansion of national legislative programs toward a European approach, the continu-
ation of beneficial support for SMEs, or the application of the output floor at the highest level of consolidation, are seen as
great opportunities to support its customers. The proposals are being continually evaluated and political discussions closely
followed to be able to respond accordingly.

Digital Finance Package initiatives and focus on consumer protection

Following publication of the European Commission's Digital Finance Strategy in September 2020, diverse regulatory initiatives
from the strategy were further pursued or launched in 2021. The European Commission put forward proposals on the regulation
of Artificial Intelligence (Al) and Digital Identity. Further initiatives by the Commission included a review of the Consumer Credit
Directive (CCD) in light of digitalization (Data Governance Act) and holding a consultation on the expected Data Act regulation.

The steady rise of European legislation focusing on digital services and new technologies will impact RBI in the coming years.

The initiatives generally aim for an increased harmonization of the respective rules across the EU to achieve a Digital Single
Market and simplification of cross-border business in the EU. Furthermore, the regulatory proposals would require/enable

Raiffeisen Bank International | Annual Report 2021

Group management report 53

changes to existing processes, e.g. for digitally onboarding customers with regard to the EU-wide Digital Identity. RBI closely
monitors these developments, is engaged in discussions between policy makers and banking associations and has actively par-
ticipated in relevant consultations.

Austrian implementation of the Capital Requirements Regulation II as well as the Capital
Requirements Directive V and Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive II

The revised Capital Requirements Regulation (EU Regulation 2019/876) and Capital Requirements Directive (EU Directive
2019/878), also known as CRR Il and CRD V, included amendments in areas such as Pillar 2 capital requirements and remunera-
tion, leverage ratio, liquidity, market risk, counterparty credit risk, as well as reporting and disclosure requirements. The Bank
Recovery and Resolution Directive Il (EU Directive 2019/879), also known as BRRD II, includes inter alia a new framework for mini-
mum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL).

The legislative package for the implementation of CRD V and BRRD II transposed certain European requirements into national
law (Austrian Banking Act and Bank Recovery and Resolution Act). Thereby introducing, for example, the additivity of macropru-
dential buffers or extended rules to calculate MREL requirements.

National macroprudential requirements were adjusted to ensure that economically unwarranted changes to capital require-
ments were not triggered. Therefore, the implementation of the European framework into national legislation did not lead to
increased capital requirements.

Minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL)

The Single Resolution Board (SRB) published the updated MREL Policy on 26 May 2021. The multiple-point-of-entry (MPE) ap-
proach, which RBI employs as its resolution strategy, requires that each resolution entity can be resolved independently without
causing shortfalls in other resolution groups.

The Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation II (SRMR II) introduced the concept of the Maximum Distributable Amount related

to MREL (M-MDA), which will be applicable from 1 January 2022. M-MDA allows the SRB to set restrictions on dividend distribu-

tions for banks. M-MDA has many similarities to the former MDA regime of Article 141 CRD, albeit is subject to the discretionary
decision of the resolution authority.

The MREL planning is an integral part of the budgeting process for RBI and its subsidiary banks in the EU. MREL levels are closely
monitored. RBI and several of its bank subsidiaries in the EU, made issuances in order to fulfill their respective MREL require-
ments (binding interim targets from 1 January 2022). It is worth highlighting that RBI covered a significant portion of its MREL
requirements in 2021 through the issuance of green bonds.

Significant events in the
reporting period

Re-contracting of ING's retail customers in the Czech Republic

In February 2021, RBI's Czech subsidiary bank, Raiffeisenbank a.s. (RBCZ), signed a referral agreement with ING Bank NV. (ING) for
the re-contracting of ING's Czech retail customers, which occurred in the second quarter following approval by the Czech Office
for Protection of the Competition.

Acquisition and integration of Equa

The acquisition of 100 per cent of the shares of Equa (Equa bank a.s. and Equa Sales & Distribution s.r..) from AnaCap (AnaCap
Financial Partners), through RBI's Czech subsidiary bank, Raiffeisenbank a.s., was closed on 1 July 2021. The consolidation of
Equa into the balance sheet of RBI therefore occurred in the third quarter and had a negative impact of around 30 basis points
on RBI's CET1 ratio.

Equa contributed € 33 million towards RBI's net interest income in the 2021 financial year. At the same time, this added € 40
million in general administrative expenses and € 15 million in impairment losses on financial assets (mostly Stage 1). The cus-
tomer loans of Equa totaled € 2,107 million.

Equa bank a.s. was merged into Raiffeisenbank a.s., RBI's Czech subsidiary bank, on 1 January 2022.
Agreement on the acquisition of Crédit Agricole Srbija

On 5 August 2021, RBI announced that its Serbian subsidiary bank, Raiffeisen banka a.d., had signed an agreement to acquire
100 per cent of the shares of Crédit Agricole Srbija (Crédit Agricole Srbija a.d. Novi Sad and Crédit Agricole Leasing Srbija d.0.0.)
from Crédit Agricole S.A. The closing of the transaction is subject to inter alia obtaining regulatory approvals.

The acquisition of Crédit Agricole Srbija is expected to have a negative impact of approximately 16 basis points on RBI's CET1
ratio. The final impact is dependent on the completion accounts at closing, which is expected by the end of the first quarter of
2022.

Crédit Agricole Srbija serves around 356,000 customers. The bank has a leading position in agricultural-business financing (over
20 per cent market share) and thus complements the business profile of Raiffeisen banka a.d. very well. At the end of the sec-
ond quarter of 2021, Crédit Agricole Srbija had total assets of € 1.3 billion, while Raiffeisen banka a.d. reported total assets of

€ 3.4 billion.

Following the successful closing of the transaction, it is planned to merge Crédit Agricole Srbija with Raiffeisen banka a.d.
Agreement reached on the sale of Raiffeisenbank (Bulgaria) EAD

In November 2021, the Management Board of RBI resolved to sell the Bulgarian subsidiary bank and its participation to KBC
Bank, a fully owned subsidiary of the Belgian KBC Group NV. The primary motivation for the decision was the possibility to real-
locate capital in order to seize attractive growth opportunities and gain scale in RBI's key markets. This operation is disclosed
separately in the balance sheet under other assets as a disposal group classified as held for sale. The sale proceeds should be
significantly higher than the carrying amount of the net assets and so no impairment was recognized from the classification of
the operation as a disposal group held for sale.

Additional dividend for 2020 of € 0.75 per share

Following the ECB decision not to extend its recommendation on the restriction of dividends, the Extraordinary General Meeting
on 10 November 2021 approved the distribution of an additional dividend of € 0.75 per share for the 2020 financial year. This led
to a positive impact of 9 basis points on RBI's CET1 ratio. Thus for the 2020 financial year, a total of € 1.23 per share in dividends
was distributed.

Earnings and financial
performance

Consolidated profit increased a substantial 71 per cent to € 1,372 million. After the pandemic-driven recession in the previous
year, the financial year 2021 was certainly a year of economic recovery. Net interest income was up 7 per cent, notably benefit-
ing from the high level of customer loan growth (up 11 per cent, or 15 per cent without consideration of IFRS 5), as well as rising
interest rates in several countries across Central and Eastern Europe. The net fee and commission income, with an increase of
18 per cent to € 1,985 million, had reached an all time high. The increase in consolidated profit was also due to significantly
lower loan loss provisions, which at € 295 million were 51 per cent down on the previous year's period. In addition to M&A activi-
ties, the rise in general administrative expenses was also due to digitalization initiatives in implementation of RBI's Vision to
become the most recommended financial services group by 2025. Key projects include the development of a digital retail bank-
ing platform, the further development of the myRaiffeisen platform in Corporates, and the rollout of innovative trading solu-
tions in Markets. The other result was impacted by the allocation of credit-linked and portfolio-based provisions for litigation,
mainly in Poland

Since the beginning of the year, supported by the economic upturn, total assets rose € 26,142 million or 16 per cent. From the
second quarter particularly, almost all markets showed significant growth in demand for loans, which only starting to lose
some momentum in the fourth quarter as the economy weakened again. Sustainable financing continued to grow in im-
portance in this respect. In the reporting period, sustainable financing totaling € 4,335 million was granted.

In contrast to the beginning of the year, when the income statement was still being impacted by the low interest rate environ-
ment and the COVID-19 pandemic, both the interest rate environment and currency developments significantly recovered from
the second quarter onwards. Nevertheless, the average exchange rates of the Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryvnia were both
5 per cent, the Belarusian ruble 7 per cent, and the US dollar 3 per cent, below the respective level of the previous year.

Operating income

Net interest income was up € 207 million to € 3,327 million. This development was mainly facilitated by rising interest rates of
several Eastern European currencies and strong loan growth with only slight negative currency effects. The largest increase, of
€ 104 million, was recorded at head office, primarily due to € 50 million in COVID-19 bonus claims under the TLTRO III program,
strong loan growth and lower financing costs from the deposit business and own issues. There was also a particularly strong
increase in net interest income in the Czech Republic, where interest rate rises and the integration of Equa bank led toa € 54
million increase in net interest income. Net interest income in Hungary was up € 40 million, supported by positive developments
in both the corporate and retail customer business, as well as higher market interest rates. In Ukraine, higher income from both
the corporate and retail customer business, as well as lower interest expenses due to changes in the product mix and maturity
split, also resulted in an increase in net interest income of € 18 million. In Slovakia, net interest income increased € 8 million,
mainly due to the COVID-19 bonus claims under the TLTRO III program.

recommended financial services group by 2025. Alongside numerous Group-wide digital solutions, this includes the develop-
ment of a digital retail banking platform, the further development of the myRaiffeisen platform and of cash management and
clearing, settlement and payment services systems in Corporates, and the rollout of innovative trading solutions in Markets.
Further expenses were incurred for the introduction of cloud solutions, for process automation and for investing in a central
security operations center. Currency effects in Eastern Europe reduced expenses. Depreciation and amortization of tangible
and intangible fixed assets increased 6 per cent, or € 23 million, to € 407 million, mainly due to the recognition of software as-
sets at head office and the integration of Equa bank in the Czech Republic.

The number of business outlets fell by 86 year-on-year to 1,771. The largest declines were in Romania (down 33), Belarus (down
14) and Slovakia (down 11). The average headcount decreased by 438 full-time equivalents year-on-year to 45,907, primarily in
the Ukraine (down 525) due to branch closures in the previous year, and in Slovakia (down 185), Romania (down 179) and Bulgaria
(down 128). Conversely, the integration of Equa bank resulted in an increase of 488.

Other result

The other result amounted to minus € 295 million in the reporting period, compared to minus € 204 million in the comparable
period. The result was impacted by the allocation of credit-linked and portfolio-based provisions for litigation in the amount of
€ 326 million (up € 266 million) in Poland, Croatia and Romania. In Poland, provisions in connection with mortgage loans denomi-
nated in or indexed to a foreign currency were allocated in the amount of € 278 million (up € 235 million) as the result of
changes in the parameters of the model calculation. Conversely, good business performance and rising stock market prices of
listed equity investments resulted in reversals of impairment losses on investments in associates valued at equity in the report-
ing period in the amount of € 66 million (UNIQA Insurance Group AG and LEIPNIK-LUNDENBURGER INVEST Beteiligungs AG). In the
previous year's period, impairment losses of € 68 million were recognized on associates valued at equity due to the deteriorat-
ing economic outlook caused by the pandemic. In the previous year's period, a goodwill impairment of € 27 million relating to
Raiffeisen Kapitalanlage-Gesellschaft was also recognized to reflect the revised medium-term plan due to the pandemic, and
impairment losses on non-financial assets in the amount of € 20 million were recognized, mainly relating to real estate in Rus-
sia and Slovakia. Net modification losses of € 40 million were incurred in the previous year’s period due to the introduction of
loan repayment moratoriums; these losses amounted to € 14 million in the reporting period. The bulk of the moratoriums ex-
pired in the reporting period.

Governmental measures and compulsory contributions

Expenses from governmental measures and compulsory contributions decreased € 44 million to € 213 million. Bank levies de-
clined € 64 million to € 39 million. This reduction mainly related to the discontinuation of the special bank levy in Austria (previ-
ous year's period: € 41 million), which was introduced in 2016 and totaled € 163 million, booked in four tranches from 2017 to
2020. In addition, the bank levy was abolished in Slovakia (previous year's period: € 26 million). Deposit insurance fees increased
€ 12 million - mainly in Russia, in Slovakia, and at Raiffeisen Bausparkasse Osterreich Gesellschaft m.b.H. - to € 99 million.

Impairment losses on financial assets

The improved economic environment in the 2021 financial year was reflected in the significant decline in risk costs. Impairment
losses on financial assets totaling € 295 million were recognized in the reporting period, compared to € 598 million in impair-
ment losses in the previous year's period due to the substantial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The calculation of expected
credit losses includes overlays (post-model adjustments and additional risk factors) totaling € 51 million in the reporting period
(€ 62 million in net allocations of provisions relating to non-financial corporations and € 11 million in net releases of provisions
relating to households), compared to mainly COVID-19-related post-model adjustments of € 282 million in the previous year's
period (€ 236 million relating to non-financial corporations and € 46 million relating to households). In addition, impairment
losses of € 28 million were recognized as a result of EU sanctions on Belarus, € 25 million due to geopolitical uncertainties in
Ukraine, and € 20 million for the credit portfolio for potentially sanctioned Russian customers.

In Stage 1 and Stage 2, net impairments of € 102 million were recognized in the reporting period (previous year's period: € 315
million), including a net € 98 million relating to loans to non-financial corporations, mainly in Austria (€ 34 million), Ukraine (€ 27
million), Belarus (€ 20 million) and Romania (€ 10 million). For defaulted loans (Stage 3), net impairments of € 180 million were
recognized in the reporting period (previous year's period: net € 302 million). Of this, € 123 million related to households, primar-
ily in Russia (€ 52 million), Romania (€ 16 million), Bosnia and Herzegovina (€ 13 million) and Slovakia (€ 12 million), while € 43 mil-
lion related to non-financial corporations, mainly in Austria (€ 24 million) and Russia (€ 12 million).

The NPE ratio was down 0.3 percentage points to 1.6 per cent due to higher lending volumes and an increase in deposits at cen-
tral banks. The NPE coverage ratio rose by 1.0 percentage points to 62.5 per cent.

Income taxes
Income taxes increased € 47 million to € 368 million, whereas the tax rate fell 6.6 percentage points to 20.6 per cent. This was

mainly due to an improved earnings contribution from head office and valuations of investments in associates valued at eq-
uity.

Development of fourth quarter of 2021 compared to third quarter of 2021

Net interest income was up € 132 million to € 976 million. The increase of € 52 million at head office and of € 23 million in Slo-
vakia were mainly due to COVID-19 bonus claims under the TLTRO Ill program. Rising interest rates and strong performance in
both the corporate and retail customer business led to an increase in net interest income in the Czech Republic (up € 23 million),
Russia (up € 16 million), and Hungary (up € 11 million).

The net interest margin improved by 24 basis points to 2.22 per cent in the fourth quarter due to rising net interest income in
numerous countries in the Group.

Net fee and commission income increased 8 per cent, or € 41 million, to € 561 million. This was mainly driven by higher income in
the custody business at head office and by early repayments in the lending business in Russia. Foreign exchange business, par-
ticularly forward foreign exchange contracts in Russia, and the loan and guarantee business at head office, in the Czech Re-
public, Slovakia and Russia, also recorded volume-related increases.

The net trading income and fair value result increased € 28 million. The increase partly resulted from positive valuation effects

from loans measured at fair value at head office. In addition, Raiffeisen Centrobank AG recorded positive valuation effects in
the certificates business in the fourth quarter.

General administrative expenses increased € 119 million quarter-on-quarter to € 856 million. Staff expenses rose € 24 million to
€ 425 million, while other administrative expenses rose € 79 million to € 313 million and depreciation increased € 16 million to

€ 118 million. The main drivers of the increase in staff expenses were a higher headcount in Russia (up € 15 million) and the inte-
gration of Equa bank in the Czech Republic (up € 7 million). The increase in other administrative expenses primarily occurred in
Russia (up € 46 million) due to higher advertising expenses, IT expenses, and legal and consulting expenses, and at head office
(up € 21 million) due to increased external consulting services. Other administrative expenses also increased in Romania (up

€7 million) mainly due to higher advertising expenses and in Ukraine (up € 6 million).

The decline in the other result was mainly attributable to higher allocations to credit-linked and portfolio-based provisions for
litigation (up € 100 million), predominantly in Poland. Furthermore, the valuation of shares in associates valued at equity re-
sulted in an impairment loss of € 8 million in the fourth quarter, following a reversal of impairment losses of € 8 million in the
previous quarter.

Impairment losses on financial assets increased € 106 million compared to the previous quarter, with increases in almost all
countries. In the fourth quarter, in particular, impairment losses totaling € 25 million were recognized due to the geopolitical
uncertainties in Ukraine, and € 20 million for the credit portfolio for potentially sanctioned Russian customers.

Statement of financial position

Since the beginning of the year, total assets rose € 26,142 million, or 16 per cent. Currency movements were attributable for

2 per cent of the increase, especially the US dollar appreciating 8 per cent and the Russian ruble appreciating 7 per cent. In the
2021 financial year, there was a significant upward trend in demand for loans - supported by the economic upturn -in almost
all markets, especially from the second quarter onward. This trend lost some momentum in the fourth quarter as the economy
began to weaken. The strategy of expanding market share in selected markets was successfully continued in the financial year
through both acquisitions and organic growth.

RBI strives to offer its customers sustainable financial products and services as part of its sustainability strategy. Sustainable
financing is increasingly in demand and harbors considerable growth potential. Sustainable financing totaling € 4,335 million
were extended in the reporting period and now account for around 8 per cent of the credit portfolio of corporate customers
and project finance. Two years ago, RBI launched a green bond program and is the largest Austrian provider of green bonds. A
subordinated green bond, RBI's third green benchmark issue following bond issues in 2018 and 2019, was issued in June 2021
with a volume of € 500 million.

The increase in loans to banks mainly occurred in the Czech Republic (up € 3,863 million) due to a higher volume of repurchase
agreements as well as in Hungary and Russia, largely attributable to short-term investments at the National Bank.

The growth in loans to customers is primarily driven by lending to non-financial corporations (corporate customers), both in the
long-term credit business and in short-term loans, and to households (retail customers), mainly for mortgage and personal
loans. The largest increases in customer loans occurred in the Czech Republic (up € 3,575 million), including € 2,509 million for
retail customers (mainly mortgage loans), and at head office (up € 2,901 million), which mainly related to lending to corporate
customers (up € 2,408 million), especially in the long-term credit business. There were also significant increases in Russia, Slo-
vakia and Ukraine. Market shares of retail and corporate customers were expanded through the acquisition of Equa bank (cus-
tomers loans totaling € 2107 million) and organic growth in the Czech Republic, and in Slovakia primarily through organic

growth. Due to the planned sale of the Bulgarian subsidiary bank and its participation, loans to customers in the amount of
€ 3,659 million were reclassified to other assets (IFRS 5) as of year-end 2021.

The increase in securities came primarily from investments in debt securities (up € 598 million net) at head office (in particular
government and bank bonds) and in Romania, mainly in government bonds.

The significant increase in cash (up € 4,897 million) was attributable to the investment of liquidity - primarily deposits at na-
tional banks - in Slovakia, at head office and in Hungary. Other assets include non-current assets and disposal groups classi-
fied as held for sale totaling € 5,531 million, primarily due to the planned sale of Bulgarian subsidiary bank and its participation.

The Group's funding from banks increased significantly with respect to short-term deposits and repo transactions and as a
result of new borrowings under the TLTRO Ill program at head office and, in the latter case, also in Slovakia.

The increase in deposits from customers was mainly attributable to short-term deposits. The largest gains in deposits were
reported in the Czech Republic (up € 6,892 million, including € 5,197 million from retail customers), Russia (up € 2,439 million),
Hungary (up € 1,227 million), Slovakia (up € 1,208 million), and Romania (up € 1,076 million). Of the increase in the Czech Republic,
€ 2,594 million came from the integration of Equa bank and € 2,071 million from the acquisition of an ING portfolio. Due to the
planned sale of the Bulgarian subsidiary bank and its participation, customer deposits in the amount of € 4,544 million were
reclassified to other liabilities (IFRS 5) as of year-end 2021.

The € 1,141 million increase in debt securities came primarily from MREL bond issues in the Czech Republic, Romania and Slo-
vakia. Other liabilities include € 4,829 million from liabilities held for sale in the disposal groups due to the planned sale of the
Bulgarian subsidiary bank and its participation.

For information relating to funding, please refer to note (54) Liquidity management in the risk report section of the consoli-
dated financial statements.

Equity on the statement of financial position
Equity including capital attributable to non-controlling interests rose € 1,187 million from the start of the year to € 15,475 million.

In April 2021, the Annual General Meeting approved a dividend payment of € 0.48 per share for 2020. An additional dividend of
€ 0.75 per share was approved at an Extraordinary General Meeting in November 2021. This amounted to a total dividend distri-
bution of € 404 million. A dividend of € 92 million was distributed for additional tier 1 capital (AT1).

Total comprehensive income increased € 1,555 million to € 1,658 million and comprised profit after tax of € 1,508 million and
other comprehensive income of € 150 million. Currency movements had a positive impact of € 284 million, following a negative
impact of € 1,007 million in the previous year. The 7 per cent appreciation of the Russian ruble led to a positive contribution of
€ 135 million, the 5 per cent appreciation of the Czech koruna contributed € 107 million and the 11 per cent appreciation of the
Ukrainian hryvnia resulted in income of € 52 million. This was partly offset by a valuation loss of € 64 million from the hedge of
net investments, primarily in Russian rubles.

Capital attributable to non-controlling interests rose € 190 million. This was primarily due to the proportion of total comprehen-

sive income attributable to non-controlling interests of € 164 million and a capital increase of € 49 million in the Czech Republic.
Dividend payments, in contrast, reduced the amount by € 39 million - mainly in Ukraine and Slovakia.

Act (BWG)

Common equity tier 1 (CET1) after deductions amounted to € 11,812 million, representing an increase of € 1,051 million compared
to the 2020 year-end figure. The main driver of the increase was the higher profit for 2021. A dividend of € 115 per share was
deducted for the 2021 financial year. Tier 1 capital after deductions increased € 971 million to € 13,460 million. The increase was
mainly due to the increase in CET1. Tier 2 capital rose € 246 million to € 2,347 million. The increase was driven by the issuance of
a Tier 2 bond in June 2021, offset by regulatory amortization of outstanding issues. Total capital amounted to € 15,807 million,
representing an increase of € 1,217 million compared to the 2020 year-end figure.

Total risk-weighted assets (RWA) increased € 11,063 million year-on-year to € 89,927 million. The major reason for the organic
growth was new loan business. Inorganic growth was driven by both rating downgrades in the lending business as well as by
increases in operational risk, largely attributable to the rise in internal and external loss data in the Advanced Measurement
Approach (AMA model).

This resulted in a (fully loaded) CET1 ratio of 13.1 per cent (down 0.5 percentage points), a tier 1 ratio of 15.0 per cent (down
0.8 percentage points) and a total capital ratio of 17.6 per cent (down 0.8 percentage points). The consolidation of Equa had a
negative effect of around 30 basis points on CET1

Digitalization

Acentral theme for banks in the advancement of digitalization is the growing relevance of mobile banking. While the penetra-
tion (rate of active mobile banking use) was at 44 per cent for RBI in 2020, it had reached 53 per cent by year-end 2021 (though
this figure varies greatly between markets). The acceptance of online loans has remained high: In 2020, 48 per cent of loans
were granted through digital channels and in 2021 this had increased slightly to 49 per cent.

In its product range for retail customers and small businesses, RBI places a strong focus on the full end-to-end digitalization of
core products (accounts, payments/cards and loans). RBI expects to achieve yearly cost savings and additional income through
this as well as the branch network optimization which is taking place in parallel.

Furthermore, plans to develop more products and individual product components centrally and to make these available to all of
the Group's banks started to be implemented. RBI also expects lower costs as a result of this initiative. Aside from the cost ben-
efit, this should lead to a substantial reduction in the time required for the full digitalization of the five most important prod-
ucts across the entire Group (current accounts, credit cards, consumer loans, as well as current accounts and loans for SMEs).

Digitalization is a key issue for corporate and institutional customers as well. Since the end of 2019, RBI has digitalized a series
of products and services on the myRaiffeisen platform. This includes a digital KYC process (eKYC) for companies and institu-
tional customers, digital account opening (eAccount Opening), digital export finance (eSpeedtrack), as well as further services
such as eFinance, eGateway, eArchive, and the digital payment questionnaire for correspondent banking clients (ePIC).

In 2021, eAccount opening was the first product to go live across the whole Group, which is an important milestone in achieving
a harmonized digital offering and experience across the entire region for RBI's corporate and institutional clients. The latest
figures in regards to usage demonstrate a broad acceptance and appreciation for RBIs digital offering - around 53 per cent of
new accounts at RBI in Austria were initiated digitally in 2021 (2020: 39 per cent), and 56 per cent of new customers were veri-
fied using the fully digitalized eKYC process (versus 42 per cent in 2020). Launched in the middle of 2021, ePIC has already been
well adopted and was utilized in around 54 per cent of the payment questionnaires.

Internal control and risk
management system in relation
to the Group accounting
process

Balanced and comprehensive financial reporting is a priority for RBI and its governing bodies. Compliance with all relevant stat-
utory requirements is therefore a basic prerequisite. The Management Board is responsible for establishing and defining a suit-
able internal control and risk management system that encompasses the entire accounting process while adhering to
company requirements. This is embedded in the company-wide framework for the internal control system (ICS).

The ICS should ensure effective and continuously improving internal controls for accounting. The control system is designed to
comply with all relevant guidelines and regulations and to optimize conditions for specific control measures in order to prevent
any unintentional misstatements.

Control environment

The Group has an internal control system pertaining to financial reporting, which includes directives and instructions on
key issues as a central element. This includes:

= The hierarchical decision-making process for approving Group and company directives, as well as departmental and
divisional instructions,

= process descriptions for the preparation, quality control, approval, publication, implementation and monitoring of di-
rectives, and instructions including related controls, as well as

= regulations for the revision and repeal of directives and instructions.

The senior management of each Group unit is responsible for implementing the Group-wide instructions. Compliance with
Group rules is monitored by Group Financial Reporting & Steering as well as through audits by Group and local auditors.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared by Group Reporting & Consolidation, which belongs to the CFO area under
the CEO. The associated responsibilities are defined for the Group within the framework of a dedicated Group function.

Risk assessment

Significant risks relating to the Group accounting process are evaluated and monitored by the Management Board. Complex
accounting standards can increase the risk of errors, as can the use of differing valuation standards, particularly in relation to
the Group's principal financial instruments. A difficult business environment can also increase the risk of significant financial
reporting errors. For the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statements, estimates have to be made for asset and
liability items for which no market value can be reliably determined. This is particularly relevant for the lending business, equity
participations and goodwill. Social capital, provisions for legal risks and the valuation of securities, are also based on estimates.

Control measures

The preparation of financial information on an individual Group unit level is decentralized and carried out by the respective
Group unit in accordance with RBI guidelines; the calculation of parts of the impairment charges under IFRS 9 is, however, car-
ried out centrally. The Group unit employees and the managers responsible for accounting are required to provide a full presen-
tation and accurate valuation of all transactions. The local management is responsible for ensuring implementation of
mandatory internal control measures, such as the separation of functions and the principle of dual control. The reconciliation
and validation controls are embedded in the aggregation, calculation, and accounting valuation activities for all financial re-
porting processes. Particular focus is placed on the controls for the core processes that play a fundamental role in the prepara-
tion of the financial statements. This primarily relates to processes which are relevant for valuations, the results of which have
a significant impact on the financial statements (e.g. valuation of credit risk provisions, derivatives, equity participations, provi-
sions for personnel expenses and market risk).

Raiffeisen Bank International | Annual Report 2021


--- Page 15 ---

64 Group management report

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns and partial physical absence (home office) had no impact on the internal
control system.

Consolidation

The financial statement data are predominantly automatically transferred to the IBM Cognos Controller consolidation system
in January of the subsequent year. The IT system is kept secure by limiting access rights.

The plausibility of each Group unit's financial statements is initially checked by the responsible key account manager in Group
Reporting & Consolidation. Group-level control activities comprise the analysis and, where necessary, modification of the finan-
cial statements submitted by Group units. In this process, the results of meetings with representatives of the individual compa-
nies, in which the financial statements are discussed, and comments from external reviews of the financial statements are
taken into account. The discussions cover the plausibility of the reporting package as well as critical matters pertaining to the
Group unit.

The subsequent consolidation steps are performed using the consolidation system, including capital consolidation, expense
and income consolidation, and debt consolidation. Finally, intra-Group gains are eliminated where applicable. At the end of the
consolidation process, the notes to the financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS and the BWG/UGB.

All control measures constitute part of the day-to-day business processes and are used to prevent, detect and correct any po-
tential errors or inconsistencies in the financial reporting. Control measures range from managerial reviews of the results for
the period, through to the reconciliation of accounts and analyzing accounting processes.

The consolidated financial statements and management report are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board
and are also presented to the full Supervisory Board for its information.

Information and communication

The consolidated financial statements are prepared using Group-wide standardized data requirements. The accounting and
valuation standards are defined and explained in the RBI Group Accounts Manual and must be applied when preparing the fi-
nancial statements. Detailed instructions for the Group units on measuring credit risk and similar issues are provided in the
Group directives. The relevant units are kept abreast of any changes to the instructions and standards through regular training
courses.

Each year the Annual Report contains the consolidated results in the form of a complete set of consolidated financial state-
ments. In addition, the Group management report contains comments on the consolidated results in accordance with the stat-
utory requirements.

Throughout the year, consolidated monthly reports are produced for the Group's senior management. The published statutory
interim reports conform to the provisions of IAS 34 and are produced on a quarterly basis. Before publication, the consolidated
financial statements are presented to senior managers and Management Board members for final approval and then submit-
ted to the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee. Analyses pertaining to the consolidated financial statements are also provided
for management, as are forecast Group figures at regular intervals. The financial and capital planning process, undertaken by
Group Business Performance Management, includes a three-year Group budget.

Monitoring

Financial reporting is a primary focus of the ICS framework, whereby financial reporting processes are subject to risk-based
prioritization and control examinations with results regularly reported to the Management Board and the Supervisory Board for
evaluation. Additionally, the Audit Committee is required to monitor the financial reporting process. The Management Board is
responsible for ongoing company-wide monitoring. The internal control system is based on three lines of defense.

The first line of defense consists of individual departments, whereby department heads are responsible for monitoring their
business areas and ensuring that an appropriate control environment is established. The departments conduct plausibility
checks and control activities on a regular basis, in accordance with the documented processes.

The second line of defense is made up of specialist areas focused on specific topics. These include, for example, Compliance,
Data Quality Governance, Operational Risk Controlling, and Security & Business Continuity Management. Their primary aim is to
support specialist areas with their control processes, to review the carrying out of controls, and to introduce leading practices
within the organization.

Internal audits are the third line of defense in the monitoring process. Responsibility for auditing lies with Group Internal Audit
and the respective internal audit departments of the Group units. All internal auditing activities are subject to the Group Audit
Standards, which are based on the Austrian Financial Market Authority's minimum internal auditing requirements and interna-
tional best practices. Group Internal Audit's internal rules also apply (notably the Audit Charter). Group Audit regularly and inde-
pendently verifies compliance with the internal rules within the RBI Group units. The head of Group Internal Audit reports
directly to the Management Board, with additional reporting obligations to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and mem-
bers of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.

corresponding to a voting interest of around 58.81 per cent, are mutually attributable to the regional Raiffeisen banks and their
direct and indirect subsidiaries pursuant to §§ 130 and 133 7 of the Austrian Stock Exchange Act (BérseG) as parties acting in
concert as defined in § 16 of the Austrian Takeover Act (UbG). The remaining shares of RBI AG are held in free float, with no
other direct or indirect shareholdings amounting to 10 per cent or more known to the Management Board.

(4) The Articles of Association do not contain any special rights of control associated with holding shares. According to the syn-
dicate agreement for RBI AG, the regional Raiffeisen banks can nominate nine members of the RBI AG Supervisory Board. In ad-
dition to the members nominated by the regional Raiffeisen banks, the RBI AG Supervisory Board should also include three
independent representatives of free-float shareholders who are not attributable to the Austrian Raiffeisen Banking Group.

(5) There is no control of voting rights arising from interests held by employees in the share capital.

(6) Pursuant to the Articles of Association, a person who is aged 68 years or older may not be appointed as a member of the
Management Board or be reappointed for another term in office. The rule for the Supervisory Board is that a person who is
aged 75 years or older may not be elected as a member of the Supervisory Board or be re-elected for another term in office.
Moreover, no person who already holds eight supervisory board mandates in publicly traded companies may be a member of
the Supervisory Board. Holding a position as chairman of the supervisory board of a publicly traded company would count
twice for this purpose. The Annual General Meeting may choose to waive this restriction through a simple majority of votes if
permitted by law. Any candidate who has more mandates for, or chairman positions on, supervisory boards in publicly traded
companies must disclose this to the Annual General Meeting. There are no further regulations regarding the appointment or
dismissal of members of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board beyond the provisions of the relevant laws. The
Articles of Association stipulate that the resolutions of the Annual General Meeting are, provided that there are no mandatory
statutory provisions to the contrary, adopted by a simple majority of the votes cast. Where the law requires a capital majority
in addition to the voting majority, resolutions are adopted by a simple majority of the share capital represented in the votes. As
a result of this provision, members of the Supervisory Board may be dismissed prematurely by a simple majority. The Supervi-
sory Board is authorized to adopt amendments to the Articles of Association that only affect the respective wording. This right
may be delegated to committees. Furthermore, there are no regulations regarding amendments to the company Articles of
Association beyond the provisions of the relevant laws.

(7) Pursuant to § 169 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Management Board has been authorized since the Annu-
al General Meeting of 13 June 2019 to increase the share capital with the approval of the Supervisory Board - in one or more
tranches - by up to € 501,632,920.50 through the issuance of up to 164,469,810 new voting common bearer shares in exchange
for contributions in cash and/or in kind (including by way of the right of indirect subscription by a bank pursuant to § 153 (6) of
the AktG) by 2 August 2024 at the latest and to fix the offering price and terms of the issue with the approval of the Supervi-
sory Board. The Management Board is further authorized to exclude shareholders’ subscription rights with the approval of the
Supervisory Board (i) if the capital increase is carried out in exchange for contributions in kind, or (ii) if the capital increase is
carried out in exchange for contributions in cash and the shares issued under the exclusion of subscription rights do not exceed
10 per cent of the company's share capital (exclusion of subscription rights). The (i) utilization of authorized capital with exclu-
sion of the statutory subscription right in the event of a capital increase in return for a contribution in cash, and the (ii) imple-
mentation of the conditional capital resolved upon in the Annual General Meeting on 20 October 2020 in order to grant
conversion or subscription rights to convertible bond creditors may not exceed 10 per cent in total of the share capital of the

company. The utilization of the authorized capital in the form of a capital increase in return for a contribution in kind is not cov-
ered by this restriction.

No use has been made to date of the authority granted in June 2019 to utilize the authorized capital.

The share capital is conditionally increased (conditional capital) pursuant to § 159 (2) 1 of the AktG by up to € 100,326,584 by
issuing of up to 32,893,962 ordinary bearer shares. The conditional capital increase will only be implemented to the extent that
use is made of an irrevocable right of conversion into or subscription to shares which the company grants to the creditors hold-
ing convertible bonds issued on the basis of the resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting on 20 October 2020, or in the
event of having to fulfil a conversion obligation set out in the convertible bonds’ terms of issuance. In both cases, the Manage-
ment Board does not decide to allocate own shares. The issue price and the conversion ratio are to be calculated in accordance
with recognized quantitative financial methodologies and the price of the company's shares in a recognized pricing procedure
(calculation basis of the issuance price); the issue price may not be below the proportionate amount of the share capital. The
newly issued shares from the conditional capital increase are entitled to a dividend equivalent to that of the shares traded on
the stock exchange at the time of issuance. The Management Board is authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board,
to determine the further details of the implementation of the conditional capital increase.

The Management Board was further authorized pursuant to § 174 (2) of the AktG by the Annual General Meeting on 20 October
2020, within 5 years from the date of the resolution, i.e. until 19 October 2025, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to is-
sue also in several tranches, convertible bonds with rights to convert into or subscribe to shares of the company or convertible
bonds with conversion obligations (contingent convertible bonds pursuant to § 26 of the Banking Act), including convertible
bonds that meet the requirements for Additional Tier 1 capital instruments pursuant to Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 of the Eu-
ropean Parliament and the Council of 26 June 2013 on supervisory requirements for credit institutions and investment firms, as
amended, with full exclusion of shareholders’ subscription rights. The authorization includes the issuance of convertible bonds
in a total nominal amount of up to € 1,000,000,000 with rights to convert into or subscribe to up to 32,893,962 ordinary bearer
shares of the company with a proportionate amount of the share capital up to € 100,326,584. The issue price and the conver-
sion ratio are to be calculated in accordance with recognized quantitative financial methodologies and the price of the com-
pany shares in a recognized pricing procedure (calculation basis of the issuance price); the issue price of the convertible bonds
may not be below the proportionate amount of the share capital. In this respect, the Management Board is authorized to de-
termine all further issuance and structural features as well as the issuance terms and conditions of the convertible bonds, in
particular the interest rate, issue price, term of validity and denomination, provisions protecting against dilution, conversion
period, conversion rights and obligations, conversion ratio and conversion price. The convertible bonds may also be issued -
observing the limit of the corresponding equivalent value in euros - in the currency of the United States of America and in the
currency of any other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member state. The convertible bonds
may also be issued by a company which Raiffeisen Bank International AG owns 100 per cent of, directly or indirectly. For this
event, the Management Board is authorized to provide, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, a guarantee for the convert-
ible bonds on behalf of the company and to grant the holders of the convertible bonds conversion rights into ordinary bearer
shares of Raiffeisen Bank International AG and, if a conversion obligation is stipulated in the convertible bonds’ issuance terms,
to enable the obligation of conversion into ordinary bearer shares of Raiffeisen Bank International AG to be fulfilled; with the
exclusion of the rights of shareholders to subscribe to the convertible bonds.

There have been no convertible bonds issued to date.

The Annual General Meeting held on 20 October 2020 authorized the Management Board pursuant to § 65 (1) 8, § 65 (1a) and

§ 65 (1b) of the AktG to purchase own shares and to retire them if appropriate without requiring any further prior resolutions to
be passed by the Annual General Meeting, though with the approval of the purchase by the Supervisory Board can also be ef-
fected off-exchange under the exclusion of the shareholders’ pro rata tender right. Own shares, whether already purchased or
to be purchased, may not collectively exceed 10 per cent of the company's share capital. The authorization to purchase own
shares expires 30 months after the date of the Annual General Meeting resolution, i.e. until 19 April 2023. The acquisition price
for repurchasing the shares may be no lower than € 3.05 per share and no higher than 10 per cent above the average un-
weighted closing price over the 10 trading days prior to exercising this authorization. The authorization may be exercised in full
or in part or also in several partial amounts, for one or more purposes - with the exception of securities trading - by the com-
pany, by a subsidiary (§ 189a 7 of the UGB) or by third parties for the account of the company or a subsidiary.

The Management Board was further authorized, pursuant to § 65 (1b) of the AktG, to decide, with the approval of the Supervi-
sory Board, on the sale of own shares by means other than the stock exchange or a public tender, to the full or partial exclusion
of shareholders’ subscription rights, and to stipulate the terms of sale. Shareholders’ subscription rights may only be excluded if
the own shares are used to pay for a contribution in kind, to acquire enterprises, businesses, operations or stakes in one or sev-
eral companies in Austria or abroad. Furthermore, shareholders’ subscription rights may be excluded in the event that converti-
ble bonds are issued in future, in order that (own) shares may be issued to such convertible bond creditors that have exercised
their right of conversion into or subscription to shares in the company, and also in the event of a conversion obligation stipu-
lated in the convertible bonds’ issuance conditions in order to fulfil this conversion obligation. This authorization may be exer-
cised in whole, in part or in several partial amounts for one or more purposes by the company, a subsidiary (§ 189a 7 UGB) or by
third parties for the account of the company or a subsidiary and remains in force for five years from the date of this resolution,
ie. until 19 October 2025. This authorization replaces the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting of 21 June 2018
pursuant to § 65 (1) 8 of the AktG to acquire and utilize own shares and refers also to the utilization of own shares already ac-
quired by the company. Since that time, there were no own shares purchased on the basis of the lapsed authorization from
June 2018 nor on the basis of the current authorization from October 2020.

The Annual General Meeting of 20 October 2020 also authorized the Management Board, under the provisions of § 65 (1) 7 of
the AktG, to purchase own shares for the purpose of securities trading, which may also be conducted off-market, during a peri-
od of 30 months from the date of the resolution (i.e. until 19 April 2023), provided that the trading portfolio of shares purchased
for this purpose does not at the end of any given day exceed 5 per cent of the company's respective share capital. The consid-
eration for each share to be acquired must not be less than half the closing price at the Vienna Stock Exchange on the last day
of trading preceding the acquisition and must not exceed twice the closing price at the Vienna Stock Exchange on the last day
of trading preceding the acquisition. This authorization may be exercised in full or in part or also in several partial amounts by
the company, by a subsidiary (§ 189 7 UGB) or by third parties acting for the account of the company or a subsidiary.

(8) The following material agreements exist, to which the company is a party, and which take effect, change, or come to an end
upon a change of control in the company as a result of a takeover bid:

= RBI AG is insured under a Group-wide D&0 policy. In the event of a merger with another legal entity, the insurance policy
would automatically cease at the end of the insurance period in which the merger took effect. In such cases, insurance
cover only exists for claims for damages arising from breaches of obligations that occurred before the merger, which are
reported to the insurer prior to the termination of RBI's Group-wide D&O insurance cover.

= RBI AG is a member of the Professional Association of Raiffeisen Banks. Upon a change in control of RBI AG which results in
the attainment of control by shareholders outside of the Raiffeisen Banking Group Austria, membership of the Professional
Association of Raiffeisen Banks, as well as that of the Raiffeisen-IPS pursuant to Art. 113 (7) of the CRR, the Osterreichische
Raiffeisen-Sicherungseinrichtung eGen and of the Raiffeisen Customer Guarantee Scheme Austria may be terminated. RBI
AG also serves as the central institution of the Raiffeisen Banking Group at a national level. Upon a change in control of RBI
AG, related contracts (central institution of the liquidity group pursuant to § 27a of the BWG may end or change.

= The company's refinancing agreements and agreements concerning third-party financing for subsidiaries, which are guar-
anteed by the company, stipulate in some cases that the lenders can demand early repayment of the financing in the event
of a change in control.

(9) There are no indemnification agreements between the company and its Management Board and Supervisory Board mem-
bers or employees that would take effect in the event of a public takeover bid.

Human Resources

The Group People & Organisational Innovation division (P&O!)
combines the areas of Human Resources and Strategy Devel-
opment. P&O! plays a central role in the implementation of
RBI's strategy and corporate goals.

On the one hand, the focus is on the efficient execution of
personnel processes such as data administration, contract
preparation or recruitment, and on the other, the division is
responsible for personnel development, career management,
as well as professional education and training. Of particular
note here would be the GO-IT Academy, which ensures the
ongoing further development of IT skills across the Group. In
October 2021, the payroll accounting unit was relocated from
P&Ol to the Finance division due to the proximity of the oper-
ational activities to parts of those of Finance, such as claims
for travel expenses. Significant operational synergies are ex-
pected from the integration of these areas.

The handling of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was also a
core issue in 2021. The already established options for mobile
and hybrid working were further developed and defined, and
the legal provisions relating to working from home (home of-
fice), were implemented by means of an appropriate di-

rective. This directive defines the framework conditions for working from home as well as the financial and technical support
available for employees working in home office. The issue of working from home from abroad was of particular importance to
RBI as an international company. RBI was one of the first companies in Vienna to offer individual home office solutions for
cross-border commuters from 2021. On the whole, 2021 has shown that significant progress could be made in the management
of uncertainties arising from the pandemic. As a result of this experience and the knowledge gained, RBI will be able to respond
in a very flexible manner to new changes in future.

Personnel development

As at 31 December 2021, RBI had 46,185 employees (full-time equivalents), which was 771 more than at the end of 2020. The
largest increases occurred in the Czech Republic due to the integration of Equa bank and in Russia.

Outlook

Economic outlook

The restrictions that were reintroduced in several countries towards the end of 2021, in order to curb infection rates, turned out
to be less stringent and more temporary than those in the winter of the previous year. The interplay between lockdowns and
the easing of measures should not have the same economic impact in 2022, as was seen in 2020 and 2021, even if renewed re-
strictions in the winter of 2022/2023 cannot be ruled out. The supply bottlenecks impacting the industrial sector are expected
to ease over the course of 2022. Monthly inflation rates are expected to have already peaked or to do so at the beginning of
2022, so long as the geopolitical risks in Eastern Europe do not materialize. In this case, inflation rates are expected to fall over
the course of 2022, though to remain at levels that are sometimes noticeably higher than in prior years. In the event of a possi-
ble military escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the imposition of sanctions poses the greatest short-term
risk to the economy and inflation. In a worst-case scenario, extensive (financial) sanctions being imposed on Russia without a
transition period, a global systemic impact on financial and commodity markets is to be expected with tangible effects in the
euro area, in particular, and more so in Central and Eastern Europe. The non-delivery or curtailing of oil and gas deliveries from
Russia could be difficult to compensate for in the short term. Resulting production losses and reductions in growth from yet
another significant hike in price increases for energy products and/or industrial metals could bring Europe at least close to a
stagflation scenario. Disruptions in the supply of important industrial metals would further exacerbate the global industrial
supply chain problems. The impact on individual European countries will depend on the scope of their bilateral trade relations
with Russia, especially the level of their dependence on Russian energy imports.

Central Europe

The economies of the Central Europe (CE) region are expected to continue expanding dynamically again in 2022. Among other
things, strong wage growth is expected to support a further significant increase in private consumption. However, the tighten-
ing of monetary policy and the impact of inflation on private consumption harbor downside risks. The region as a whole is ex-
pected to see GDP growth of 4.3 per cent in 2022, with Hungary and Slovenia leading the way (in each case 4.5 per cent) and
the Czech Republic bringing up the rear (4.1 per cent). The outcome of the Hungarian elections could overshadow the partner-
ship with the EU in the coming years and further increase tensions. The vaccination cover in the region is at a lower level than
in Western Europe and so pandemic risks are considered somewhat greater, even with a certain reluctance to impose re-
strictions. The economic impact of extensive (financial) sanctions would be more pronounced in CE than in the euro area due to
its closer trade ties with Russia as well as greater reliance on Russian energy imports.

Southeastern Europe

The economic recovery in the Southeastern Europe (SEE) region is expected to continue at a solid pace in 2022. Key factors are
private consumption, which should receive support from overseas remittances as well as from pent-up demand due to the
pandemic. Investment (inter alia NGEU) is also expected to play a key role. The highest growth in 2022 is expected in Romania
and Kosovo, both at 4.7 per cent. Vaccination coverage rates are again lower than in the CE region, resulting in higher pandemic
risks, though governments have so far shown very little willingness to take restrictive measures. The economic impact of exten-
sive (financial) sanctions would be more pronounced in SEE than in the euro area due to its closer trade ties with Russia as well
as greater reliance on Russian energy imports.

Eastern Europe

Significantly lower GDP growth is forecasted for the Eastern Europe (EE) region in 2022, than the year prior, assuming the ab-
sence of an increase or escalation of geopolitical tensions, and partly reflects the lesser impact of the pandemic but also mon-
etary policy measures in the region. In Russia, the slowdown in economic growth is also attributed to the substantial reduction
in fiscal support. In Belarus, the sanctions imposed by the EU and the US are expected to have a greater impact on the econ-
omy in 2022 than in 2021. In Ukraine, on the other hand, growth is expected to accelerate due to the inflow of external funds
from the IMF and the EU. Nevertheless, geopolitical tensions and potential losses from the Nord Stream 2 project pose risks to
the Ukrainian economy. In view of the current potential escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the effects on
the economic outlook and financial system may be manifold and would largely depend on the future development of the con-
flict and scale of sanctions which could be imposed in such a risk scenario. Furthermore, the escalation of the conflict has the
potential to pull Ukraine into a deep recession, while the Russian economy (despite being more resistant than in 2014 and cer-
tain relief provided by probable oil price increases in connection with exports possibly being redirected) would probably also fall
into recession in face of extensive sanctions.

Austria

The back-and-forth between lockdowns and the easing of restrictions should no longer be an economic determinant in Austria
from the second quarter. It is therefore assumed that economic trends will be less volatile in 2022, than was the case in the two
years prior. Nevertheless, economic momentum is likely to remain above average. Considerable momentum is expected from
the continuing decline in the savings rate, the good situation in the labor market, wage increases, as well as from private con-
sumption. The encouraging investment trend is also expected to continue. GDP is expected to grow 4.5 per cent in 2022, though
a military escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine poses a downside risk to the economy.

Banking sector in Austria

The profitability of Austrian banks could weaken as government support measures expire amid the still persistent pressure
from the low interest rate environment. Corporate lending could slow as corporate liquidity needs are declining, and banks are
beginning to tighten their lending standards. In contrast, persistently favorable lending conditions should ensure continued
strong demand for mortgage loans from private households, which may trigger action by regulators. The outlook for risk costs
continues to be weighed down by the large inventory of Stage 2 loans (around 25 per cent for corporations). On a positive note,
the solid capital position of Austrian banks provides an additional buffer, even for in the event of a stress scenario. The poten-
tial increase of pressures from sanctions on Russia bears risks to the profitability of Austrian banks through indirect economic
effects, however also as a result of the profit contributions from CE/SEE subsidiaries (38 per cent of consolidated profit of Aus-
trian banks in the first half of 2021). The Austrian banking sector belongs to the three EU banking sectors with the most ties to
Russia.

CEE banking sector

Despite pandemic risks, the overall outlook for CEE banks in 2022 is positive, so long as there is no escalation of the sanctions
against Russia issue. Although some moderation in bank profitability is warranted (slowdown in economic recovery, reduction in
policy incentives), the trend towards normalization of economic activity should continue to support the banks’ lending and
transaction revenues. Higher interest rates are also positive for net interest margins in CE/SEE. At the same time, the expiration
of loan repayment moratoriums could lead to insolvencies among borrowers, which would put moderate pressure on NPE ratios
and risk costs. On a positive note, the capitalization ratios of banks in the region remain solid and the liquidity situation com-
fortable. Credit and economic cycles are expected to become more aligned in the medium term. Nevertheless, selected EU
countries are expected to receive additional support for lending growth from the Next Generation EU program (especially Ro-
mania, Croatia, and Bulgaria). The potential escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict bears risk of new substantial sanctions
against Russia, which - if imposed - could have a strong impact on both the Russian economy (directly) and on the broader CEE
banking market (indirectly through economic developments). This therefore poses a downside risk to the performance of the
CEE banking market in 2022. The Russian banking market remains the third largest banking market for Western banks in CEE
(after Poland and the Czech Republic, and before Slovakia and Romania).

Outlook for RBI
2022 Guidance

In 2022, net interest income is expected to increase by high single digit per cent and net fee and commission income by mid-
single per cent. We expect loan growth in the range of 7 to 9 per cent.

We expect general administrative expenses to grow in the high single digit percentage area plus an additional approx. € 100
million integration cost for acquisitions in the Czech Republic (Equa bank) and Serbia (Crédit Agricole Srbija).
The cost/income ratio is expected to be around 55 per cent excluding the one-off integration costs.

The provisioning ratio for 2022 is expected to be around 40 basis points.

Consolidated return on equity is expected to be above our 11 per cent medium-term target, reflecting the gain on the sale of
the subsidiary bank in Bulgaria.

We expect a CET1 ratio of around 13 per cent by year end 2022.

Potential geopolitical risks, especially in Eastern Europe, are not included in this guidance.

Mid-term targets

We are committed to a cost/income ratio of around 55 per cent and aim to improve further in the medium term.
We target 11 per cent consolidated return on equity in the medium term.
We confirm our CET1 ratio target of around 13 per cent.

Based on the CET1 ratio target, we intend to distribute between 20 and 50 per cent of consolidated profit.

The main reason for the year-on-year decline in profit after tax was the negative development of the other result in Poland,
where credit-linked and portfolio-based provisions for litigation had a negative impact of € 278 million (up € 235 million) on the
other result. In contrast, net interest income rose € 99 million due mainly to higher income in the Czech Republic (up € 54 million
as a result of interest rate increases and the integration of Equa bank) and Hungary (up € 40 million, reflecting higher market
interest rates and the positive trend in both corporate and retail customer business). Net fee and commission income was up

€ 67 million, driven by higher income mainly in foreign exchange business and from clearing, settlement and payment services
in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Other net operating income was down largely as a result of the release of a provi-
sion for litigation in Slovakia in the comparable period of the previous year (€ 18 million). General administrative expenses were
up € 71 million, primarily in the Czech Republic (up € 54 million) due to the integration of Equa bank (€ 34 million). In addition,
legal and advisory costs increased in Poland and the Czech Republic, while IT expenses were up above all in the Czech Republic.
The decline in governmental measures and compulsory contributions was due to the abolition of the bank levy in Slovakia in
July of the previous year. The decrease in risk costs (down € 106 million) in all countries was attributable to improved economic
conditions and rating improvements.

The increase of € 128 million in profit after tax from continuing operations reflected the steep decline in risk costs combined
with better economic conditions and rating improvements. At € 33 million, the risk costs were € 114 million lower than in the
comparable period of the previous year, mainly as a result of developments in Romania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and
Albania. The operating result also improved - driven mainly by the 19 per cent, or € 61 million, increase in net fee and commis-
sion income, in particular as a result of increased transactions in clearing, settlement and payment services and foreign ex-
change business - following COVID-19-related restrictions in the comparable prior-year period. General administrative expenses
decreased primarily in Romania, especially due to lower staff expenses as a result of the decline in the number of staff follow-
ing network optimization and various other administrative expenses. In contrast, the other result was impacted by higher
allocations to credit-linked and portfolio-based provisions for litigation (up € 31 million) in Romania and Croatia.

The decision to sell the Bulgarian subsidiary bank and its participation was made in the reporting period. Under IFRS 5, discon-
tinued operations are to be reported under the line item profit/loss from discontinuing operations, this amounted to
€ 70 million in the financial year.

As in the previous year, profit after tax was affected by currency volatility (the Belarusian ruble depreciated by 7 per cent year-
on-year, while the Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryvnia both fell 5 per cent). In Ukraine, higher income from corporate and retail
customer business, as well as lower interest expenses due to changes in the product mix and maturity split, resulted in an
increase of € 18 million in net interest income. Net fee and commission income also increased in Russia as a result of higher
volumes, mainly in customer resources distributed but not managed and foreign exchange business, primarily in forward for-
eign exchange contracts. The net trading income and fair value result declined due to valuation effects relating to derivatives
and debt securities, mostly in Russia. General administrative expenses were up as a result of higher advertising and IT expenses
in Russia and Ukraine, as well as increases in salaries and social security costs and staff-related taxes. In the same period of
the previous year, impairments on non-financial assets - mainly relating to real estate in Russia - totaling € 15 million were also
recognized, the valuation thereof led to a reversal of € 12 million in the reporting period. Risks costs were down € 19 million due
to improved economic conditions. In contrast, Belarus posted impairment losses of € 28 million as a result of EU sanctions. In
addition, provisions of € 25 million were recognized to reflect geopolitical uncertainties in Ukraine and € 13 million for sanctions
(credit portfolio for potentially sanctioned customers) in Russia.

The year-on-year increase in profit after tax was mainly due to the € 124 million rise in operating income and the € 56 million
decline in risk costs. The main driver of the improvement in operating income was a significant increase in net fee and commission
income. This rise in income was predominantly generated in loan and guarantee business, clearing, settlement and payment ser-
vices, investment banking at head office, as well as from higher income from investment fund management at Raiffeisen Kapita-
lanlage-Gesellschaft. The increase in net interest income mainly resulted from loan growth and COVID-19 bonus claims under the
ECB's TLTRO Ill program. The decline in risk costs mainly reflected lower Stage 2 und Stage 3 loan loss provisions year-on-year at

head office.

The year-on-year increase in profit after tax was driven primarily by a € 351 million rise in intra-Group dividend income. The other
result improved due to reversals of impairment on investments in associates valued at equity totaling € 66 million, following an
impairment on investments in associates valued at equity of € 74 million and a € 27 million goodwill impairment relating to
Raiffeisen Kapitalaniage-Gesellschaft were recognized in the previous year. The reduction in expenses for governmental measures
and compulsory contributions was largely due to the final payment of the special bank levy in Austria in the previous year (€ 41
million).
