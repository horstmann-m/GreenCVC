Creation of Stellantis

On 16 January 2021, PSA merged with and into FCA. By virtue of the merger, FCA issued 1.742 FCA common

combination.

Following the merger, Exor continues to hold 449,410,092 common shares of Stellantis, corresponding to 14.4% of
the outstanding capital.

On 29 January 2021, the extraordinary dividend of approximately €2.9 billion (Exor’s share €827 million) was paid

Definitive Agreement for the sale of PartnerRe signed by Exor and Covéa
On 16 December 2021 Exor and Covéa signed a Definitive Agreement to sell PartnerRe, the global reinsurer
wholly-owned by Exor.

The agreed cash consideration of $9.0 billion to be paid by Covéa at closing of the transaction is based on a
consolidated common shareholders’ equity value of $7.0 billion. Preferred Shares issued by PartnerRe and listed
on the NYSE are not part of the transaction.

Subject to obtaining approvals from the applicable regulatory and competition authorities, it is expected that the
transaction will be completed in mid-2022.

Following a successful closing of the transaction, Exor and Covéa will continue their reinsurance cooperation, with
Exor acquiring from Covéa interests in special purpose reinsurance vehicles managed by PartnerRe for
approximately $725 million. These vehicles will invest in property catastrophe and other short-tail reinsurance
contracts underwritten by PartnerRe. Covéa, Exor and PartnerRe will also continue to invest jointly in Exor-
managed funds with reinforced alignment of interests.

REVIEW OF THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
OF THE EXOR GROUP

Exor (and the subsidiaries constituting the Holdings System) together with its operating subsidiaries,
constitute the “Exor Group” or the “Group”.

This section includes a selection of the most relevant financial data from the consolidated financial
statements of the Exor Group.

In order to ensure that data is coherent and uniform, it is presented based on Exor consolidation
rules and IFRS accounting standards and therefore may differ from the data published by

subsidiaries in their financial reports.

BOARD REPORT | 13
REVIEW OF THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF THE EXOR GROUP

Accounting of Stellantis and deconsolidation of FCA
On 16 January 2021 PSA merged with and into FCA, with FCA as the surviving company in the merger. On
17 January 2021 the combined company was renamed Stellantis N.V.

Exor's Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2021 include the financial data of FCA for the period
1 January - 16 January 2021 before the merger with PSA, applying the line by line consolidation method.

Following the merger, Exor lost control over FCA and therefore derecognized the former FCA Group net assets at
16 January 2021 and accounted for the investment in Stellantis applying the equity method, having a significant
influence over Stellantis in accordance with IAS 28.

The economic data of FCA have been excluded from continuing operations and are presented in a single line item
within the consolidated income statement for the year 2021 and 2020, as a discontinued operation. The assets and
liabilities of FCA Group at 31 December 2020 have not been reclassified for the comparative consolidated
statement of financial position. For further detail see Note 3 Scope of consolidation in the Consolidated financial
Statements.

Deconsolidation of PartnerRe

On 16 December 2021 Exor and Covéa signed a Definitive Agreement to sale PartnerRe, the global reinsurer
wholly-owned by Exor. At 31 December 2021, the sale within the next twelve months became highly probable and
the subsidiary met the criteria to be classified as a disposal group held for sale and a discontinued operation
pursuant to IFRS 5, since it represents a separate major line of Exor Group Business.

The economic data of PartnerRe have been excluded from continuing operations and are presented in a single line
item within the consolidated income statement for the year 2021 and 2020, as a discontinued operation. The assets
and liabilities of PartnerRe at 31 December 2020 have not been reclassified for the comparative consolidated
statement of financial position. For further detail see Note 3 Scope of consolidation in the Consolidated financial
Statements.

Net revenues

Net revenues of CNH Industrial for the year 2021 were €28,309 million, with an increase of €3,599 million
compared to the year 2020 (€22,749 million), due to higher volumes driven by strong industry demand together
with favourable price realization.

Net revenues of Ferrari for the year 2021 were €4,271 million, with an increase of €811 million or 23.4% (an
increase of 26.0% on a constant currency basis), compared to €3,460 million in the year 2020, mainly attributable
to the combination of €738 million increase in cars and spare parts, €38 million increase in engines, a €41 million
increase in sponsorship, commercial and brand, partially offset by €6 million decrease in other net revenues.

Net Profit (loss) from continuing operations

Net profit from continuing operations of CNH Industrial was €1,502 million in the year 2021 as a result of the strong
performance from all segments, while in the year 2020 the result was a net loss of €608 million and included the
before and after-tax goodwill impairment loss of €523 million, other assets impairment charges of €288 million
(€237 million after-tax), as well as asset optimization charges of €256 million (€206 million after-tax).

In the year 2021 the net profit from continuing operations of Ferrari was €833 million, significantly up versus the
year 2020 (€609 million). The increase of €224 million was mainly attributable to the increase in net revenues. In
the year 2020 costs as a percentage of net revenues were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which
caused a seven-week production and delivery suspension in the year 2020 as well as changes to the calendar and
format of the 2020 Formula 1 World Championship.

Financial debt is constituted mainly of bond issues and bank borrowings. As is usual practice, the major part of
such debt agreements contains covenants which inter alia limit the capacity of Group companies to contract further
debt, make certain types of investment, put into effect certain types of transaction with Group companies, dispose
of certain assets or merge with or into other companies and use assets as security for other transactions. Further,
certain bond issues and bank borrowings require the issuer to remain in compliance with financial ratio covenants.

In the year 2020, Exor and its subsidiaries took several key actions to secure their financial position, including
drawing credit lines and facilities and securing additional incremental instruments to strengthen the available

liquidity.

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (APM)

To facilitate the understanding of the economic and financial performance of Exor and of the Group, the
Management of Exor has identified a number of Alternative Performance Measures (APM), which are used to
identify operational trends and to make investment and resource allocation decisions. To ensure that the APM are
correctly interpreted, it is emphasized that these measures are not indicative of the future performance of the
Group. The APM are not part of international reporting standards (IFRS) and are unaudited. They should not be
taken as replacements of the measures required under the reference financial reporting standards.

The APM should be read together with the consolidated financial information prepared using the shortened
consolidation criterion. Since they are not based on the reference financial reporting standards, the APM used by
Exor may not be consistent and comparable with those used by other companies or groups. The APM used by Exor
have been consistently calculated and presented for all the reporting periods for which financial information is
presented in this Report.

It should also be noted that the principal subsidiaries and associates make use of alternative performance
measures to illustrate their performance to the market. Such indicators are commonly used by analysts and
investors in the sectors to which the subsidiaries belong to evaluate business performance. A description of how
such indicators are calculated is provided by the individual subsidiary companies and these are included in the
section Review of performance of the Operating Subsidiaries in the Board Report, as extracted from their
respective published documents. Such information is prepared autonomously by the companies and is not
homogeneous. Set out below are the main APM’s identified by Exor:

« NetAsset Value
¢ Net Financial Position
« Share of the (loss) profit of investments accounted for using the equity method.

Net Asset Value (NAV)

Definition and Methodology
Net Asset Value (NAV) corresponds to the total value of assets net of the Gross Debt and other liabilities of the
Holdings System as defined below.

To determine the value of an asset:
¢ Listed equity investments and other listed securities are valued at official market prices.

¢ Unlisted equity investments are valued on the basis of the valuation method that better reflects their most
recent fair value which can be either (i) a valuation determined annually by independent experts at the end
of the year, (ii) a valuation of a recent round or arms-length transaction or (iii) a valuation at cost if the
investment has been completed recently.

« Investments in funds or other investment vehicles are valued at NAV or Exor's share of the value reported
by the fund.

* Bonds held to maturity are valued at amortized cost and bonds held for trading are valued at market value.

* Treasury stock includes the shares held in treasury designated to service stock option plans (measured at
the option exercise price under the plan if this is less than the market price). Treasury stock does not
include the shares bought back under the share buyback program launched in November 2018 and
completed in November 2020. Starting from 31 December 2021, shares held in treasury and not allocated
to stock option plans are excluded from the NAV calculation.

The sum of the aforesaid values constitutes the total value of assets (Gross Asset Value or GAV). Gross Debt
corresponds to the total amount of the financial debt of the Holdings System and Other liabilities include liabilities
not included in the net financial position.

Items included in the calculation of Gross Asset Value and Gross Debt which are denominated in foreign currencies
are converted at the official exchange rates at the corresponding reporting date.

Net financial position of the Holdings System
The net financial position of the Holdings System, determined by applying the shortened consolidation criterion, is a
representative measure of the financial resources and commitments directly attributable to and managed by Exor.

Using the shortened consolidation criterion adopted by Exor, rather than the line-by-line method of consolidation
required by law and under IFRS, the data derived from the financial statements or accounting data prepared in
accordance with IFRS by Exor and by the subsidiaries constituting the Holdings System - Exor Nederland N.V. (the
Netherlands), Exor S.A. (Luxembourg), Exor Investments Limited (United Kingdom), Ancom USA Inc. (USA), Exor
SN LLC (USA) - are consolidated in the financial statements of the parent company Exor using the line-by-line
method, while the data derived from the financial statements or accounting data prepared in accordance with IFRS
of the operating subsidiaries and associates (Ferrari, Stellantis, PartnerRe, CNH Industrial, Juventus Football Club,
The Economist Group, GED! Gruppo Editoriale, Exor Seeds, Shang Xia, Christian Louboutin, Welltec, NUO and
Exor Capital LLP (previously Exor Investment (UK) LLP), are included in the consolidated financial statements of
the parent company Exor using the equity method.

The presentation of financial data under the shortened consolidation method facilitates the analysis of the financial
position and results of Exor and it is generally recognized by the financial community, including financial
counterparties and rating agencies.

BOARD REPORT | 23
Nevertheless, such data do not fully represent, nor should be treated as the consolidated financial position of the
Exor Group prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In fact, the shortened
consolidation method is not contemplated in the reference accounting standards on the presentation of

therefore, such data may not be comparable with the data reported by such groups.

REVIEW OF THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
OF THE EXOR GROUP — SHORTENED

This section includes the results of the Exor Group based on the “shortened” criterion of
consolidation.

According to this method, the Holdings System companies are consolidated line-by-line and the
operating subsidiaries and associates are consolidated using the equity method.

While the presentation of such data is not contemplated in the reference accounting standards, Exor
believes that this information facilitates the analysis of the results and the financial position of Exor
Group.

26} BOARD REPORT
REVIEW OF THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF THE EXOR GROUP - SHORTENED
As described above in the APM section, Exor applies a shortened consolidation criterion to facilitate the analysis of
the financial position and results of Exor.

Using the shortened consolidation criterion, rather than the line-by-line method of consolidation required by law and
under IFRS, the data derived from the financial statements or accounting data prepared in accordance with IFRS
by Exor and by the companies constituting the Holdings System are consolidated in the financial statements of the
parent company Exor using the line-by-line method, while the data derived from the financial statements or
accounting data prepared in accordance with IFRS of the operating subsidiaries (Ferrari, PartnerRe,
CNH Industrial, Juventus Football Club, GEDI Gruppo Editoriale, Exor Seeds, Exor Capital - previously Exor
Investment (UK) - and Shang Xia) and associates (Stellantis, The Economist Group, Christian Louboutin, Welltec
and NUO) are included in the consolidated financial statements of the parent company Exor using the equity
method.

The consolidated data prepared in shortened form are not audited by the independent auditors.

Accounting for Stellantis and the deconsolidation of FCA

On 16 January 2021, PSA merged with and into FCA. By virtue of the merger, FCA issued 1,742 FCA common
shares for each outstanding PSA ordinary share and each PSA ordinary share ceased to exist. Each issued and
outstanding common share of FCA remained unchanged as one common share in FCA. The surviving entity
changed its name to Stellantis on 17 January 2021, which was the accounting acquisition date for the business
combination. Following the merger, Exor continues to hold 449,410,092 common shares of Stellantis,
corresponding to 14.4% of the outstanding capital.

In accordance with the above transaction Exor lost control over FCA and therefore derecognized the former FCA
Group net assets at 16 January 2021 and reclassified to the income statement, in the Net non-recurring other
income/(expenses) item, the amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income related to the
subsidiary. Additional details are provided in Note 4.

At the date of completion of the merger Exor assessed to have significant influence on Stellantis and started
applying the equity method according to IAS 28. On initial recognition the investment was accounted for at cost,
equal to €6,660 million, attributed to Exor's share of Stellantis's net fair value as part of the purchase price
allocation process completed at 31 December 2021.

Accounting for Christian Louboutin
On 13 April 2021 Exor closed the transaction for the acquisition of the 24% interest in Christian Louboutin, for a
total consideration of €541 million.

At 31 December 2021, Christian Louboutin was accounted for using the equity method, in accordance with IAS 28,
on the basis of the consolidated financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS at that date, while the
income statement includes the share of the result for the period 1 May to 31 December 2021.

At 31 December 2021 the purchase price allocation process is completed.

Exor closed the year 2021 with a consolidated profit of €1,717 million; the year 2020 ended with a consolidated
loss of €30 million (mainly due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the overall performances of
the subsidiaries). The net change of €1,747 million is mainly attributable to the improvement of the performances of
the operating companies (€3,009 million), partially offset by the effect of the settlement reached by Exor with the
Italian Tax Authorities (“Agenzia delle Entrate”) for €744 million recognized in tax expenses (of which €101 million
as interest expense) and a non-recurring loss (€504 million) arising from the deconsolidation of FCA, following the
merger with PSA. Additional details are provided in Notes 1, 4 and 5.

in Note 8.

The consolidated net financial position of the Holdings System at 31 December 2021 is a negative €3,924 million
and reflects a negative change of €673 million compared to the negative financial position of €3,251 million at

4. Net non-recurring other (expenses) income
In the year 2021 net non-recurring expenses amount to €514 million of which €504 million arising from the
deconsolidation of FCA, following the merger of PSA with and into FCA. In particular €490 million relate to the
reversal to the income statement of Exor's share in the FCA items, previously recognized in other
comprehensive income reserve.

In the year 2020 net non-recurring other income (expenses) amounted to €50 million and mainly referred to a
one-off income (€63 million), partially offset by consulting fees related to investment and disinvestment projects
(€12 million) and contributions to cultural and charitable associations (€1 million).

5. Income taxes and other taxes and duties
In the year 2021 income taxes amount to €789 million and mainly includes the effect of a settlement reached on
18 February 2022 by Exor with the Italian Tax Authorities (“Agenzia delle Entrate”) on a complex tax issue,
specifically in respect of the Exit Tax and has paid €746 million, of which €104 million is represented by interest.

The issue is related to the Italian registered company Exor S.p.A. that in December 2016 merged with its Dutch
subsidiary Exor Holding N.V. to create today’s Exor domiciled fiscally in the Netherlands. At the time of this
cross-border merger, the exiting company Exor S.p.A. applied the Participation Exemption (PEX) regulations as
set out in Article 87 of the Italian Corporate Income Tax Act. Under this regime, 95% of any capital gains
relating to the value of its holdings was exempt and therefore excluded from the holding company’s taxable
income for the determination of the Exit Tax.

With a subsequent principle of law “Legal Principle 10/2021”, published on 11 May 2021, the Agenzia delle
Entrate contended that the PEX should not apply to cases in which a holding company transfers its fiscal
domicile abroad without maintaining a permanent establishment in Italy.

As a result of the subsequent principle of law published in 2021, a complex matter of interpretation on the
application of the PEX regulation back in 2016 has arisen. Exor remains convinced that it acted in accordance
with the rules. However, with the objective of avoiding the time and costs of a major tax dispute, it has decided
to enter into a settlement agreement with the Agenzia delle Entrate.

At 31 December 2021, the effect of this settlement is a recognition of a liability of €744 million, of which
€643 million of income taxes and €101 million of interest.

At the same time, Exor settled with the Agenzia delle Entrate a previous tax claim related to the treatment of
financial income in the fiscal year 2015, against which Exor had appealed and other minor formal matters. The
closing of the litigation generates income taxes of €32 million, interest of €3 million and an increase of tax
liability of €20 million.

There are no outstanding fiscal issues pending for Exor in respect of all the years in which it was tax resident in
Italy, the ordinary statutory terms for any assessment having also expired.

(a) On 16 January 2021, PSA merged with and into FCA. The surviving entity changed its name to Stellantis on 17 January 2021, which was the accounting
acquisition date for the business combination.

(b) The acquisition date is 30 April 2021.

(c) Mainly includes investments in Welltec, NUO and Exor Capital LLP.

The positive change in Exor’s investment in Ferrari (€81 million) is primarily due to Exor’s share of the profit
(€201 million), partially offset by the payment of dividends (€39 million) and the buy-back of treasury stock
(€56 million).

The positive change in Exor’s investment in PartnerRe (€1,114 million) is mainly attributable to the positive
translation differences (€567 million) and Exor’s share of the profit (€580 million), partially offset by dividend
distributions (€90 million).

The positive change in Exor's investment in Stellantis (€1,964 million, from €6,660 million at 16 January 2021 to
€8,624 million at 31 December 2021) is mainly attributable to Exor's share of the profit (€1,905 million), to the
positive change in the remeasurement of defined benefit plans reserve (€252 million) and to the positive
translation differences (€304 million), partially offset by dividend distributions (€143 million) and distribution of
Faurecia (€406 million, of which €363 million as investment and €43 million as cash).

The positive change in Exor’s investment in CNH Industrial (€531 million) can be ascribed primarily to Exor’s
share of the positive result (€398 million), to the positive translation differences (€144 million), partially offset by
the payment of dividends (€41 million) and the negative movement on the fair value reserve (€32 million).

7. Investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income

COVID-19

The global spread of the COVID-19 virus, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization
in March 2020, has led to governments around the world mandating various restrictive measures to contain the
pandemic, including social distancing, quarantine, “shelter in place” or similar orders, travel restrictions and
suspension of non-essential business activities. To date, several of these measures are still in place or were
reintroduced at various points in time as a result of further “waves” of the pandemic, although the scope and timing
of restrictive measures have varied greatly across jurisdictions.

As the virus spread and the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic became apparent, Ferrari's leadership took
actions to protect and support its employees and communities, mitigate the impacts on the Group’s financial
performance and strengthen the Group’s liquidity and financial position.

Ferrari’s leadership is continuously monitoring the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic as new information
becomes available as well as the related effects on the results of operations and financial position of the Group.
Ferrari has been gradually recovering from the effects of the COVID-19-related suspension of production and other
business activities that occurred primarily in 2020. The effects of the pandemic on Ferrari in 2021 were limited and,
building on the otherwise strong performance in a year in which the Group exceeded its guidance on all metrics,
management looks to seize the opportunities ahead and share its future plans on 16 June 2022 in Maranello at the
Capital Markets Day.

The future impacts of COVID-19 on Ferrari’s results of operations and financial condition will depend on ongoing
developments in relation to the pandemic, including the success of the gradual release of containment measures
and vaccination programs worldwide, as well as the overall condition and outlook of the global economy.

Shipments
Shipments totalled 11,155 units in 2021, up 2,036 units or 22.3% versus the prior year.

Shipments increased by 2,036 cars, or 22.3 percent, driven by a 34.6 percent increase in shipments of our V8
models while shipments of our V12 models decreased by 16.1 percent, mainly due to the 812 Superfast, which
was phased out during 2021. In particular, the increase in shipments was driven by the F8 family, together with the
Ferrari Roma and the SF90 Stradale, which both reached global distribution in the second quarter of 2021, as well
as the ramp up of the Ferrari Portofino M and the SF90 Spider, partially offset by the Ferrari Portofino, the 488
Pista family and the 812 Superfast. Additionally, deliveries of the Ferrari Monza SP1 and SP2 increased in 2021
compared 2020, in line with planning, and the models are reaching the end of production. The positive mix impact
was driven by the SF90 family and the Ferrari Monza SP1 and SP2, as well as higher revenues from
personalizations.

Net revenues

Net revenues for 2021 were €4,271 million, an increase of €811 million or 23.41% (an increase of 26.0% on a
constant currency basis), compared to €3,460 million in 2020. The increase was attributable to the combination of
€738 million increase in cars and spare parts, €38 million increase in engines, €41 million increase in sponsorship,
commercial and brand, partially offset by a €6 million decrease in other net revenues.

Net revenues generated from cars and spare parts were €3,573 million (up 26.0% or 28.8% at constant currency,
due to higher car volumes, positive mix and personalizations, partially offset by negative foreign currency
exchange impact. Shipments in 2020 were were impacted by the seven week production and delivery suspension
in the first half of the year caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Net revenues generated from Engines were €189 million for 2021,an increase of €38 million, or 25.7%, from
€151 million for 2020.The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in engines sold to Maserati and, to a
lesser extend, higher revenues from the rental of engines to other Formula 1 racing teams.

Net revenues generated from sponsorship, Formula 1 commercial agreements and brand management activities
were €431 million for 2021, an increase of €41 million, or 10.4 percent, from €390 million for 2020. The increase
was primarily attributable to Formula 1 racing activities, driven by the more favourable Formula 1 calendar
compared to 2020, and brand-related activities, partially offset by a lower prior year Formula 1 ranking.

EBIT

EBIT for 2021 was €1,075 million, an increase of €359 million, or 50.2 percent, from €716 million for 2020. As a
percentage of net revenues, EBIT increased from 20.7 percent in 2020 to 25.2 percent in 2021.

The increase in EBIT was primarily attributable to the combined effects of (i) positive volume impact of
€220 million, (ii) positive product mix impact of €212 million, (iii) an increase in research and development costs of
€61 million, (iv) an increase in selling, general and administrative costs of €12 million, (v) positive contribution of
€77 million driven by Formula 1 racing activities reflecting the more favourable Formula 1 calendar compared to
2020 as well as higher contribution from brand-related activities, Maserati engines and other supporting activities,
partially offset by a lower prior year Formula 1 ranking, and (vi) negative foreign currency exchange impact of
€77 million (including foreign currency hedging instruments) primarily driven by the strengthening of the Euro
compared to the U.S. Dollar and the Japanese Yen.

The positive mix impact was driven by the SF90 family, the Ferrari Monza SP1 and SP2, and personalizations,
partially offset by the ramp up of the Ferrari Roma and the Portofino M and reduced contribution of the 812
Superfast, which was phased out during 2021.

2022 Outlook
The year 2022 is subject to trading conditions unaffected by further COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and based on
the following assumptions:

— carefully leveraging strong demand;

out;

— Ferrari Daytona SP3 and Ferrari Purosangue will commence production in 2022 with deliveries starting in
2023;

— Formula 1 revenues reflecting more diversified but lower sponsorship, partially offset by better prior year
ranking;

— increasing depreciation and amortization in line with the start of production of new models;
— _ industrial free cash flow generation sustained by Daytona SP3 advances collection;
— disciplined capital expenditures to fuel long term development.

PartnerRe

(100% interest in common shareholder's equity and 99.8% of voting rights; through Exor Nederland N.V.)

Data presented and commented below are derived from PartnerRe’s consolidated financial information for the year
ended 31 December 2021 and 2020 prepared in accordance with US GAAP.

Year

$ million 2021 2020

Net premiums written 7,134 6,301
Non-life combined ratio 90.5 % 106.0 %
Life and Health allocated underwriting result® 97 70
Net investment return 2.7 % 46%

Net income attributable to PartnerRe common shareholders“) 679 206

Net Income ROE” 9.7 % 3.1%

(a) PartnerRe uses a combined ratio to measure results for the Non-life P&C and Specialty segments. The combined ratio is the sum of the technical and other
expense ratios.

(b) PartnerRe uses allocated underwriting result as a measure of underwriting performance for its Life and Health segment. This metric is defined as net
premiums earned, other income or loss and allocated net investment income less life policy benefits, acquisition costs and other expenses.

(c) Net income/loss attributable to PartnerRe common shareholders is defined as net income/loss attributable to PartnerRe less preferred dividends.

(d) Net income ROE is calculated as net income return on average common shareholders’ equity.

Net premiums written for 2021 increased to $7.1 billion compared to $6.3 billion in 2020. Non-life net premiums
written increased 14% for the full year 2021 compared to the same period of 2020. The current year included
favourable premium adjustments from prior underwriting years, compared to the prior year which included adverse
premium adjustments related to the economic downturn.

The Non-life underwriting profit was $507 million (combined ratio of 90.5%) for the full year 2021. This compares to
Non-life underwriting loss of $304 million (combined ratio of 106.0%) for the full year 2020. Large catastrophic
losses were $483 million for the full year 2021 and included losses for Hurricane Ida, Winter Storm Uri, the
European Floods, and related losses under aggregate covers, which adversely impacted the P&C and Specialty
combined ratios by 12.1 points and 3.3 points, respectively. This compared to large catastrophic losses of 6.5
points and 11.6 points on the P&C and Specialty combined ratios, respectively, for the full year 2020 from
COVID-19 and Hurricane Laura. There were no changes in PartnerRe's net non-life COVID-19 ultimate loss
estimates that were established in 2020.

The P&C segment reported a combined ratio 94.3% for the full year 2021, compared to 102.2% for the full year
2020. While large catastrophic losses increased across comparative periods, this was offset by an aggregation of
mid-size loss events during 2020. Excluding large catastrophic losses, the combined ratio improved in relation to
the comparative period as the current accident year attritional loss ratio benefited as a result of portfolio reshaping
in prior periods and rate increases.

The Specialty segment reported a combined ratio 83.1% for the full year 2021, compared to 112.2% for the full
year 2020. In addition to the decrease in large catastrophic losses, the improvement in the combined ratio was
driven by improvements in the current accident year attritional loss ratio resulting from strategic reductions in less
profitable lines and favourable prior years' reserve development, which was 6.9 points favourable for the full year
2021, primarily driven by financial risks and aviation lines. This compared to adverse prior years' reserve
development 7.2 points for the full year 2020.

The Life and Health allocated underwriting result was a profit of $97 million for the full year 2021, compared to a
profit $70 million for 2020. Losses on protection products due to COVID-19 increased by $10 million, with
$36 million for the full year 2021 compared to $26 million for the full year 2020. Excluding COVID-19, the increase
in allocated underwriting result was driven by improvement in the short-term protection business, which was
partially offset by a lower level of gains related to recaptures of business compared to the full year 2020.

BOARD REPORT / 41
Net investment income increased $15 million, or 4.4%, for the full year 2021, compared to the same period of
2020, primarily due to the impact of re-allocations to investment grade corporate bonds, and higher reinvestment
rates driven by increases in worldwide risk-free rates in 2021.

Net realized and unrealized investment gains of $38 million for the full year 2021 included net realized and
unrealized investment losses of $539 million on fixed maturities and short-term investments, $277 million of net
realized and unrealized investment gains on equities and $300 million of net realized and unrealized gains on
other invested assets and investments in real estate. Losses on fixed maturities and short-term investments were
primarily unrealized and driven by increases in worldwide risk free rates and losses on real estate sector
investments in PartnerRe's Asia high yield portfolio, partially offset by narrowing credit spreads. Gains on equities
were also primarily unrealized, resulted from increases in worldwide equity markets and also included a large
realized gain on the sale of a preferred share investment in the fourth quarter of 2021. Gains on other invested
assets were primarily driven by unrealized gains on private equity investments.

For 2020, net realized and unrealized investment gains of $454 million included net realized and unrealized
investment gains of $245 million on fixed maturities and short-term investments, primarily due to decreases in
world-wide risk free rates and credit spreads, and $209 million of net realized and unrealized investment gains on
equities, investments in real estate and other invested assets. Interest in earnings of equity method investments of
$127 million for full year of 2021 primarily reflects the unrealized Almacantar gain recorded in the fourth quarter
and realized and unrealized gains on private equity funds and New York real estate funds.

Other Income Statement items

Other expenses of $399 million (expense ratio of 5.7%) for the full year 2021 increased $43 million compared to
$356 million (expense ratio of 5.4%) for 2020. The increase was driven primarily by increased personnel
expenses, including higher annual incentive and long term incentives due to the higher growth in book value
reported by PartnerRe in 2021.

Net foreign exchange losses were $31 million for the full year 2021 and driven by the appreciation of the U.S.
dollar against certain major currencies (primary the Euro, British Pound and Swiss Franc), while net foreign
exchange losses were $52 million for the full year 2020 were driven by the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against
the same currencies.

Interest expense was $56 million for the full year 2021, compared to $39 million for the same period of 2020. The
increase for the full year 2021 was driven by the issuance of $500 million 4.50% Fixed-Rate Reset Junior
Subordinated Notes due 2050 during the third quarter of 2020.

A preferred dividend of $23 million for the full year 2021, compared to $46 million for the same period of 2020. In
May 2021, PartnerRe fully redeemed its Series G, H and | preferred shares for a liquidation value of $637 million.
PartnerRe also incurred a loss on redemption of $21 million, related to the preferred share issuance costs that
were included in Additional paid-in-capital at issuance, and upon redemption were expensed, with no net impact to
Common shareholder's equity. Following the redemption, only Series J preferred shares remain.

Income tax expense was $38 million on pre-tax income of $762 million for the full year 2021 compared to a benefit
of $13 million on pre-tax income of $241 million in 2020. These amounts were primarily driven by the geographical
distribution of pre-tax profits and losses.

Balance sheet and capitalization

Total investments and cash and cash equivalents were $20.4 billion at 31 December 2021, up 1.4% compared to
31 December 2020. The increase was primarily driven by cash provided by operating activities of $1,233 million,
partially offset by cash used for the net redemptions of preferred shares with a liquidation value of $437 million,
common and preferred dividends paid of $130 million and net decreases in payables for securities purchased.

Cash and cash equivalents, fixed maturities, and short-term investments, which are government issued or
investment grade fixed income securities, were $14.5 billion at 31 December 2021, representing 71% of the total
investments and cash and cash equivalents.

The average credit rating of the fixed income portfolio was AA- at 31 December 2021. The expected average
duration of the public fixed income portfolio at 31 December 2021 was 4.0 years, while the average duration of
PartnerRe’s liabilities was 4.3 years.

Dividends declared and paid to common shareholders were $107 million for the full year 2021, compared to
$50 million for the full year 2020.

42 | BOARD REPORT
Common shareholder's equity (or book value) of $7.3 billion and tangible book value of $6.8 billion at
31 December 2021 increased by 9.8% and 10.8%, respectively, compared to 31 December 2020, primarily due to
the comprehensive income for the full year 2021, partially offset by dividends on common and preferred shares.
Book value, excluding dividends on common shares for 2021, was up 11.4% compared to 31 December 2020.

Total capital was $9.4 billion at 31 December 2021, up 1.6% compared to 31 December 2020, primarily due to the
increase in book value described above and the issuance of the Series J Preferred Shares, partially offset by the
redemption of Series G, H and | preferred shares and a decrease in the U.S dollar value of PartnerRe's Euro
denominated debt, as the U.S dollar strengthened against the Euro during the year.

Dividend paid to Exor
In July 2021, PartnerRe declared and paid to EXOR Nederland N.V common share dividends of $107 million,
compared to $50 million for 2020.

Reconciliation of reported US GAAP financial information to IFRS financial information used for line-by-
line consolidation purposes

The differences between the US GAAP net income ($679 million) and the IFRS net income ($695 million) are
immaterial and related only to the economic effects of the application of the acquisition method by Exor to account
for the acquisition.

2022 Outlook

PartnerRe believes that overall, reinsurance will broadly remain a cyclical market, albeit of less amplitude, primarily
as a result of capital inflows and outflows, and that the cycles will become more specific and local, with less global
amplitude. The current macro condition with inflation, supply chain constraints and climate change concerns will
continue to keep pressure, both on primary and reinsurance rates for the foreseeable future.

The outlooks for 2022 for each of PartnerRe's segments are summarized as follows:

2022 P&C Segment Outlook

During the 1 January 2022 renewals, PartnerRe observed improving pricing trends, especially within casualty and
professional lines as well as in the property catastrophe business, particularly in the loss-affected accounts. In
spite of a competitive reinsurance market with adequate overall capacity, PartnerRe was able to maintain, and in
certain instances, grow its premium base at favourable rates.

2022 Specialty Segment Outlook

During the 1 January 2022 renewals, PartnerRe generally observed improved pricing, particularly in cyber and in
property classes, where market participants held firm on both loss-affected and non loss-affected accounts.
Incumbency and our ability to trade across multiple lines were key to achieving our signings.

2022 Life and Health Outlook

The 1 January 2022 renewal for life business is not significant, as only a limited portion of the premiums written
associated with the life portfolio is short-term business. Management expects continued growth in the PartnerRe’s
life portfolio in 2022 assuming constant foreign exchange rates, mainly due to growth in Asia, Canada, Europe and
the United States. Pricing conditions are not expected to materially differ from 2021.

FCA - PSA merger
On 17 December 2019, FCA and PSA entered into a combination agreement providing for the combination of FCA
and PSA through a cross-border merger, with FCA as the surviving legal entity in the merger.

On 14 September 2020, FCA and PSA agreed to amend the combination agreement. According to the combination
agreement amendment, the FCA extraordinary dividend, to be paid to former FCA shareholders was reduced to
€2.9 billion, with PSA’s 46% stake in Faurecia planned to be distributed to all Stellantis shareholders promptly after
closing following approval of the Stellantis board and shareholders.

On 4 January 2021, PSA and FCA extraordinary general shareholder meetings approved the merger. Following the
respective shareholder approvals and receipt of the final regulatory clearances, FCA and PSA completed the legal
merger.

On 17 January 2021, the combined company was renamed Stellantis, the board of directors was appointed and
the Stellantis articles of association became effective. On this date, the Stellantis management and board of
directors collectively obtained the power and the ability to control the assets, liabilities and operations of both FCA
and PSA. As such, under IFRS 3 - Business Combinations (“IFRS 3”), 17 January 2021 is the acquisition date for
the business combination.

The merger was accounted for by Stellantis using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3,
which requires the identification of the acquirer and the acquiree for accounting purposes. Based on the
assessment of the indicators under IFRS 3 and consideration of all pertinent facts and circumstances,
management determined that PSA is the acquirer for accounting purposes and as such, the merger has been
accounted for as a reverse acquisition. In identifying PSA as the acquiring entity, notwithstanding that the merger
was effected through an issuance of FCA shares, the most significant indicators were (i) the composition of the
combined group’s board, composed of eleven directors, six of whom were to be nominated by PSA, PSA
shareholders or PSA employees, or were current PSA executives, (ii) the combined group’s first CEO, who is
vested with the full authority to individually represent the combined group, and was the president of the PSA
Managing Board prior to the merger, and (iii) the payment of a premium by pre-merger shareholders of PSA.

44 | BOARD REPORT
On 29 January 2021, the approximately €2.9 billion extraordinary distribution was paid to holders of FCA common
shares of record as of the close of business on Friday, 15 January 2021.

INDUSTRIAL

(27.06% stake, 41.68% of voting rights on issued capital)

Iveco Group Business Spin-off and Discontinued Operations
Until 31 December 2021, CNH Industrial N.V. owned and controlled the Off-Highway business (the Agriculture
business, the Construction business, and the related Financial Services business) and On-Highway business (the
Commercial and Specialty Vehicles business, the Powertrain business, and the related Financial Services
business, together the “lveco Group business” or "Iveco Group").

Effective 1 January 2022, the Iveco Group business was separated from CNH Industrial N.V. in accordance with
Section 2:334a (3) of the Dutch Civil Code by way of a legal statutory demerger to lveco Group N.V. (the
"Demerger").

On 3 January 2022, Iveco Group N.V. common shares began trading on the regulated market Euronext Milan,
under the ticker symbol "IVG". As a result of the Demerger, each holder of CNH Industrial N.V. common shares
(and special voting shares as the case may be) received one Iveco Group N.V. share for every five CNH Industrial
N.V. common shares (or special voting share as the case may be) held at close of business on the record date for
allocation (4 January 2022). Since 3 January 2022, CNH Industrial N.V. and Iveco Group N.V. have been quoted
separately on the regulated markets and operate as independent listed companies, each with its own management
and Board of Directors.

As the transaction took effect on 1 January 2022, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2021 relate to CNH Industrial Pre-Demerger.

Additionally, as the Demerger is a "business combination involving entities or businesses under common control",
it is outside the scope of application of IFRS 3 — Business Combinations and IFRIC 17 — Distributions of Non-cash
Assets to Owners. Accordingly, in the 2022 consolidated financial statements for CNH Industrial Post-Demerger
and lveco Group, the opening position for items in the statement of financial position will be equivalent to the
carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements of CNH Industrial Pre-Demerger.

Key consolidated figures for both groups, for the year 2021 are as follows:

COVID 19 Effects and Actions

The COVID-19 pandemic and the related actions of governments and other authorities to contain COVID-19
spread continue to affect CNH Industrial’s business, results and cash flow. Governments in many countries where
CNH Industrial operates, designated part of our businesses as essential critical infrastructure businesses. This
designation allows CNH Industrial to operate in support of its dealers and customers to the extent possible. CNH
Industrial also continues to prioritize the health, safety and well-being of its employees.

The Company remains cautious about future impacts on CNH Industrial's end-markets and business operations of
restrictions on social interactions and business operations to limit the resurgence of the pandemic. CNH Industrial
is closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business, its employees and the
Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Global Supply Chain Disruptions

On 13 October 2021, CNH Industrial announced the temporary closure of several of its European agricultural,
commercial vehicle and powertrain manufacturing facilities in response to ongoing disruptions to the procurement
environment and shortages of core components, especially semiconductors. The global supply chain still shows
increasing input costs and logistics pressures, with ongoing disruptions to the procurement environment forcing
repeated reviews of production schedules. Global supply chain represented the main challenge for the operations
in the year, with multiple bottlenecks resulting in increased raw material prices, intermittent subcomponent
availability, notably for semiconductors, and increased transportation costs.

Revenues

Consolidated net revenues for 2021 were $33,481 million, an increase of 28.9% (up 27.3% on a constant currency
basis) compared to 2020. This increase is primarily due to an increase of 30.6% (up 28.9% on a constant currency
basis) compared to the prior year in net revenues of Industrial Activities due to continued strong industry demand
and positive price realization.

The following discussion provides a breakdown for Off-Highway and On-Highway businesses.

Off Highway — CNH Industrial excluding lveco Group

In 2021, net revenues of CNH Industrial excluding lveco Group were $19,474 million, up 32.5% compared to 2020
(up 31.6% on a constant currency basis). The net sales of Industrial Activities of Continuing Operations were
$17,835 million, up 36.4% (35.4% on a constant currency basis) compared to 2020. The increase was due to
higher industry demand, favourable price realization and lower destocking compared to the previous year.

Net revenues for Agriculture were $14,754 million in 2021, up 35.2% (34.2% on a constant currency basis), mainly
due to higher industry demand, better mix, favourable price realization and lower destocking compared to 2020.

For 2021, worldwide industry unit sales for tractors increased 14% compared to 2020, while worldwide industry
sales for combines were up 19% compared to 2020. In North America, industry volumes in the over 140 hp tractor
market sector were up 23% and combines were up 25%. Industry volumes for under 140 hp tractors were up 10%.

industry volumes increased 22% and combine industry volumes increased 19%. Rest of World markets increased
15% for tractors and 19% for combines.

Net revenues for Construction were $3,081 million in 2021, up 42% compared to 2020 (up 40.9% on a constant
currency basis), driven by favourable price realization, higher demand, and lower destocking by dealers and
distributors.

In 2021, global demand for construction equipment was up 14% compared to 2020, with Heavy sub-segment up
16% and Light sub-segment up 13%. Demand increased 23% in North America, 19% in Europe, 87% in South
America, and 6% in Rest of World.

Financial Services reported net revenues of $1,664 million in 2021, up 1.2% compared to 2020 (up 0.9% on a
constant currency basis), primarily due to higher used equipment sales and higher average portfolios in Europe,
South America and Rest of Word, partially offset by lower average portfolio in North America due to a reduction in
wholesale financing.

Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities
Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities was $2,086 million ($416 million in 2020), with an adjusted EBIT margin of
6.6%. The increase in adjusted EBIT was primarily attributable to all segments being up year over year.

Off Highway — CNH Industrial excluding lveco Group

Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities of CNH Industrial excluding lveco Group was $1,729 million, a $1,212 million
increase compared to 2020. The improvement was driven by higher volume, favourable mix and positive price
realization, partially offset by higher raw material and freight costs, and higher variable compensation.

Adjusted EBIT of Agriculture was $1,794 million in 2021, compared to $856 million in 2020. The $938 million
increase was driven by higher volumes, favourable mix and price realization in all regions, partially offset by higher
raw material and freight costs, higher SG&A costs driven by higher variable compensation. R&D spend returning to
more normal levels from the low levels experienced in the previous year. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 440 bps
to 12.2%.

Adjusted EBIT of Construction $83 million in 2021 (up $276 million compared to 2020). The improvement was due
to positive price realization and favourable volumes and mix, partially offset by higher production costs related to
raw material and freight

On Highway — IVECO Group

Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities of lveco Group was $357 million (€101 million loss in 2020). The improvement
was driven by higher volume and positive price realization, partially offset by higher raw material costs, freight
costs, and rework costs due to components shortages.

Adjusted EBIT of Commercial and Specialty Vehicles was $300 million in 2021 (an increase of $469 million
compared to 2020). The improvement was driven by higher volumes and positive price realization, partially offset
by increased raw material costs, freight costs, and rework costs due to components shortages. SG&A costs
increase was driven by higher variable compensation. R&D spending returned to more normal levels from the lows
of the prior year. Adjusted EBIT margin was 2.5%.

Adjusted EBIT of Powertrain was $246 million in 2021, a $23 million increase compared to 2020, mainly due to
favourable volume and mix in the first half of the year, almost offset by unfavourable raw material costs, higher
freight costs due to logistics constraints, higher SG&A costs and lower absorption of fixed cost in the second half of
the year due to certain third-party sales discontinuation. R&D spending returned to a pre-pandemic level. Adjusted
EBIT margin was 5.5%, in 2021.

The following information refers to the first half of 2021/2022 of Juventus F.C.

For a correct interpretation of the data, it should be noted that the financial year of Juventus does not coincide with the calendar year, but covers the period 1 July —
30 June, which corresponds to the football season. The accounting data under examination (6 months) thus represents the first half of operations for the financial
year 2021/2022.

On the other hand, the financial data prepared only for Exor consolidated reporting purposes covers the period of 12 months (the second half of the financial year
2020/2021 and the first half of the financial year 2021/2022) and cannot be construed as representing the basis for a Juventus 2021/2022 full-year projection.
Result performance is characterized by the highly seasonal nature typical of the sector, determined mainly by the calendar of football events and the two phases of
the players’ Transfer Campaign.

The financial position and cash flows are also affected by the seasonal nature of the income components; in addition, some revenue items are collected in a period
different from the period to which they refer.

For a correct interpretation of the data, it should be noted that the continuing health emergency related to the
COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent measures imposed by the Authorities have significantly penalised - as
for all companies in the sector - both the results of the first half of the 2021/2022 financial year and those of the
previous year. The pandemic mainly affected - directly and indirectly - match revenues, revenues from product
sales and revenues from players' rights management, with an inevitable negative impact of both economic and
financial nature.

The Group's economic trend is characterised by a strong seasonal nature, typical of the business sector,
determined essentially by participation in sports competitions, the calendar of sports events and the players’
Transfer Campaign.

The first half of the 2021/2022 financial year closed with a consolidated loss of €119 million, a moderate increase
compared to the loss of €114 million in the first half of the previous financial year, due to lower revenues for
€35 million, mainly related to lower income from television and radio rights (€39 million); in the first half of the
previous year, this item benefited also from the higher number of Serie A and UEFA Champions League matches
played in the period. The negative effect mentioned above was partially offset by higher match revenues, an
increase of €8 million thanks to the partial reopening of the stadium, and lower operating costs for €21 million.

The increase in net equity is due to the completion of the capital increase transaction (€394 million, net of related
costs), partially offset by the result of the period.

The decrease in net financial debt (€310 million) is linked to the capital increase (€394 million), whose effects were
partially compensated by negative cash flows from operation (-€28 million), payment related to the Transfer
Campaign (-€48 million), investment in other fixed assets (-€1 million) and cash flows from financing activities
(-€7 million).

Audit by Consob

By letter dated 12 July 2021, Consob (Italian Supervising Authority) initiated an inspection of Juventus pursuant to
Article 115, paragraph 1, letter c) of Legislative Decree no. 58/1998 concerning the acquisition of documentation
and information relating to the item "Income from players' registration rights" recorded in the financial statements at
30 June 2020 and 30 June 2021.

Juventus responded to the Authority's requests and provided due and full cooperation during the aforementioned
audits. At present, the Company has not received any notice of the initiation of proceedings by the said Authority.

Requests for information from sports Authorities

In a letter dated 4 October 2021, Co.Vi.So.C. (an Italian sport Authority), on the basis of press reports, requested
Juventus to provide information about the requests for inquiries regarding the separate and consolidated financial
statements of Juventus received in 2021 from inspection bodies and, in particular, information about the expected
response time and the elements of assessment regarding the facts subject to the said requests for inquiries;
subsequently, in a letter dated 29 November 2021, Co.Vi.So.C. requested Juventus to provide further information,
in particular with regard to the news published in the press concerning the criminal proceedings described in the
following section.

On 24 November 2021, the Procura Federale (Federal Prosecutor's Office) of the F.1.G.C. (Federazione Italiana
Giuoco Calcio) made a request to Juventus for documentation concerning the transfer of the rights to the
performances of various football players, in the framework of proceedings opened by the same Prosecutor's
Office. Juventus provided these documents and all the information requested.

On 21 February 2022, Juventus received, together with 10 other Italian football companies and respective senior
managers, a “Comunicazione di conclusione delle indagin’’ (Communication of termination of investigations) from
the Federal Prosecutor’s Office before the F.I.G.C. with regard to the valuation of the effects of certain transfers of
players’ rights on the financial statements and the accounting of gains, following the “segnalazione” (report) by
Co.Vi.So.C., for the postulated breach of article 31, paragraph 1, and articles 6 and 4 of the “Codice di Giustizia
Sportiva” (Sport Justice Code). The communication served, concerning certain transfers completed in the financial
years 2018/19, 2019/20 and 2020/21, does not constitute the exercise of the disciplinary action by the Federal
Prosecutor’s Office. Juventus had access to the records and articulate its defences in accordance with the terms
set forth in the code and trusts it will be in a position to demonstrate the correctness of its conduct.

Criminal proceedings pending before the Turin Judicial Authority

On 26 November 2021 and 1 December 2021, search and seizure orders were served on Juventus, through the
Officers of the "Guardia di Finanza of the Nucleo di Polizia Economico-Finanziaria" of Turin.

In the same date, Juventus was informed of the existence of an investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office of
the Court of Turin, against itself and some of its current and former representatives, concerning the item "Income
from players' registration rights" recorded in the financial statements at 30 June 2019, 2020 and 2021 for the
offences referred to in Article 2622 of the Italian Civil Code (False corporate communications by listed companies)
and art. 8 of Legislative Decree no. 74/2000 (Issue of invoices or other documents for non-existent transactions)
and, as far as the Company is concerned, for the offence envisaged by articles 5 (Liability of the body) and 25-ter
(Corporate offences) of Legislative Decree no. 231/2001.

The investigation launched by the Public Prosecutor's Office at the Court of Turin is ongoing and to date, no notice
of conclusion of the preliminary investigations pursuant to art. 415-bis of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been
served. Juventus is cooperating with the investigators and trusts that it will clarify any aspect of interest to them,
believing that it has operated in compliance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial
reports, in accordance with accounting principles and in line with international football industry practice and market
conditions.

Outlook 2022

As a result of the continuing health emergency linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic, financial and
sporting reference context is still characterised by a high degree of uncertainty, which makes the formulation of
reliable forecasts regarding possible short - to - medium term developments quite complex. However, the positive
effects of the vaccination campaigns underway, both in Italy and globally, now make it possible to presume a
gradual reduction in the various restrictive measures imposed by the Authorities during the second half of the
2021/2022 financial year and a substantial normalisation of the general economic context starting from the second
half of the current year.

The Juventus' Group continues to monitor the developments of the pandemic and governmental measures, in
order to align promptly the management of its business to the changing environment, adopting appropriate
measures to protect its revenue sources and assets, and to continue to apply high standards to the measures
adopted to safeguard the health and welfare of its registered customers and employees.

As things stand at present, the 2021/2022 financial year — still heavily affected by the direct and indirect effects of
the pandemic — is expected to show a significant loss. It should also be noted that, on the assumption of a
substantial normalisation of the general economic context starting from the second half of 2022, and as a result of
the cost rationalisation and revenue recovery activities carried out in the financial year ended 30 June 2021 and
effective in the medium term, the Group's economic performance is expected to improve significantly starting from
2022/2023 financial year.

In assessing the business outlook, the uncertainties typical of football operations remain, stemming in particular
from the First Team's performance in the competitions in which it participates.

COVID-19

The performance in 2020 was severely penalised by the trend in the first six months, a period in which all areas of
the Group's business were heavily affected by the circumstances surrounding the spread of the COVID-19 virus
and the resulting restrictive measures adopted by the public and local authorities to contain it. In particular, the
drop in consumption was reflected directly in the trend of advertising investments.

The start of 2021 has also been affected by the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and its related restrictive measures.
In Italy, the number of cases started to grow in February and reached a peak in the last ten days of March. Since
mid-April, the situation has been improving and has made it possible to slowly phase out restrictions and reopen
commercial activities.

The vaccination campaign and the introduction of new rules such as the green pass had positive impacts in terms
of general infection levels and hospitalisations, leading to a gradual improvement in the situation.

The evolution of the health emergency continues to have a significant impact on macro-economic forecast, and
while the extensive vaccination coverage achieved has been reflected positively in the medium-term forecasts, the
duration and intensity of the post-pandemic recovery remain uncertain.

GEDI monitors the evolution of the situation on a daily basis in order to minimize its effects on the business, both
in terms of work-place health and safety and of GEDI’s economic performance and financial position. GEDI has
established and promptly implemented the necessary action plans, while continuing at the same time to invest
accordingly with the individual strategies identified.

In the context described above consolidated revenues stood at €520 million, excluding the impact of the local
papers sold last year (this translates to a growth of 2.7%). Revenues from digital activities represented 17.3% of
consolidated revenues (22.1% for the la Repubblica brand).

Circulation revenues from traditional products and digital subscriptions amounted to €218 million, a decline of 6%

In 2021, the actions to increase the sales of digital subscriptions have continued: the subscriber base, which has
grown by 30% compared to the close of 2020, has attained higher profitability compared to the same period in
2020. This improvement is principally due to the transition of the customer base from promotional offers made in
2020 to full pricing. It is a measure of the continued interest of subscribers in GEDI’s digital products — going
beyond the effects of the COVID-19 emergency and in spite of the ending of the promotional period — and of the
effectiveness of the new customer retention and engagement initiatives designed to reduce churn and to increase
readers’ consumption of products.

In May 2021 the new Repubblica App was released which combines in one single app all the newspaper’s digital
offerings (both free of charge and subscription) with state of the art functionalities.

Meanwhile, the production of paid digital content, particularly audio, was developed: up to 25 audio-articles were
published per day (175 per week) by La Repubblica and La Stampa, in addition to daily reports by regular
contributors, several original audio-series and the Long-Form audio version of La Repubblica.

With an average of around 4.9 million unique users a day and 26.6 million unique users a month on both of its
websites (Audiweb, average data for January - December 2021), the Group is the fifth largest operator on the
Italian digital market.

2021 was also a year of innovation, focusing on the quality of content for the GEDI Group's social media channels,
a strategy that has proven highly successful in terms of reach and engagement. The growth on Instagram was
particularly positive, as reflected in the results of La Repubblica (1.6 million followers, up 21.2% compared to 2020,
and 58.6 million user-generated interactions), La Stampa (460,000 followers, +24.7% in 2020, and 9.1 million user-
generated interactions) and Radio Deejay (1.1 million followers, +14.9% in 2020, and 13.8 million user-generated
interactions). When combined with the results of the new companies acquired by the Group, total generated
interactions reached over 85 million with over 140 million views, not counting reels. We also saw positive growth
on Facebook, up by an average of 4% year-on-year for the Group's publications, with a total of over 70 million
user-generated interactions and more than 250 million views.

During 2021, the strategy of releasing Content Hubs continued, with Moda & Beauty, il Gusto and Italian Tech,
distributed across la Repubblica, La Stampa and all the local daily newspapers, in multichannel format (digital and
paper) with a digital focus and a unified organizational structure. In 2020, the Green & Blue and Salute Content
Hubs were successfully launched.

The purpose of the Content Hubs is to increase digital subscriptions, host interesting content for advertisers and
ensure production and sales efficiency along the vertical themes.

Advertising revenues amounted to €260 million; excluding the impact of the local papers sold in the previous year,
growth stood at 12.5%.

In terms of the various media within the Group, GEDI’s advertising revenue from print newspapers increased by
8.4%, radio broadcasting by 14.9% and internet by 24.3% respectively.

Net loss

The consolidated net result was a loss of €50 million, including provisions relative to the disputes regarding alleged
fraud against INPS of €23 million, impairment on publications of €17 million, restructuring expenses, depreciation
on printing equipment and real estate, and other extraordinary items, with a total impact on net profit of €7 million.
Furthermore, in 2021, the sale of the equity investment in the company Editoriale Corriere di Romagna was
concluded, resulting in capital gains of €0.1 million (book value €0.6 million, sale price €0.7 million), as were the
sales of the equity investments in Editoriale La Liberta, Teleliberta and Altrimedia with a loss of €0.7 million (book
value €9.2 million, sale price €8.5 million). Finally, a write-down of €1.8 million was recorded for the equity
investments held in the Italian press agency ANSA, aligning the book value to the fair value.

BOARD REPORT |57
In 2020 the loss for the year was €166 million, including impairments on goodwill and publications of €82 million,
restructuring expenses and other extraordinary items with an impact on net profit of €24 million and losses realised
on the sale of local papers of €11 million. In 2020 write-downs of €7 million were also recorded on the value of the
investment held in Editoriale Liberta and Editoriale Corriere di Romagna and €13 million for adjustments on
deferred tax assets due to the worsening forecasts for the recovery of previous tax losses due to COVID-19. Net of
the aforementioned effects, the adjusted loss for 2021 was €2 million, compared to a loss of €29 million in the
previous year.

2022 Outlook

For 2022, the leading agencies and institutions are indicating a growth in Italian GDP above 4% and suggest that
the Italian economy could return to pre-crisis production levels in the first quarter of the year. However, the drawn-
out duration of the pandemic continues to cause a significant slowdown of activities in certain economic sectors; in
particular, the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus was particularly damaging for families and businesses,
generating serious organisational problems due to the high level of infectiousness of the variant despite the
fortunately less critical clinical context. Furthermore, international tensions in Eastern Europe, with the consequent
spike in costs of energy and certain raw materials, undoubtedly represent another critical concern.

At present, therefore, the factors that contribute to the construction of revenue forecasts, and in particular of
advertising revenues, both for the editorial (printed and digital) and the radio broadcasting segments continue to be
subject to major uncertainty.

To mitigate the effects of these external events, GEDI's management is implementing a series of incisive actions to
contain the main cost categories. The aim is to achieve further savings while at the same time continuing to invest
according to the individual strategies identified, in particular, seizing all the opportunities offered by the digital
revolution to make the transformation needed to reach an ever-larger customer base on any platform.

Despite this, 2022 has been marked by some important projects aimed at developing the monetisation of content
produced by the GEDI Group's brands.

The availability of a vast collection of audio content able to span different genres and interests has led to the
launch in January 2022 of One Podcast, an app that aggregates all the Group's audio content in one place: news,
radio shows, and a catalogue of podcasts, live radio broadcasts, re-runs of radio episodes, clips and online radio.
News content is monetised through subscriptions while radio content is freely accessible to all users.

Also in January the new HuffPost website was launched with a new graphic design, fresh content and a strategy
aimed at consolidating the readership community. The range of information, analyses and investigative reports
was expanded thanks to collaborations with prestigious columnists, and a paywall was introduced for all of the
publication's exclusive content. In mid-February the new app for smartphone and tablets was launched.

Finally, on 31 January 2022 the sale of the business unit comprising the daily newspaper La Nuova Sardegna and
the printing centre to the SAE S.p.A. publishing group was completed and the building used for its editorial and
administrative offices was sold to a third party. The publication had been leased to the company DB Information
S.p.A. since December 2016. The operation follows the sale of four local newspapers by GEDI to SAE in October
2020. The concessionaire A. Marzoni&C. will continue to manage the advertising revenue for the publication.

With regard to future evolutions, considering the actions put in place and those yet to be implemented, the Group
believes - assuming the absence of a renewed spike in infections and the consequent imposition of containment
measures and/or the worsening of the international context - to have the managerial and financial leverage needed
to guarantee a positive future outlook in the medium and long term. The actions undertaken by the Government to
sustain the national economy may, also, provide a positive contribution to the Company’s results.

Dividends and distribution of reserves expected to be received in the year 2022
The dividends and distributions of reserves already received or proposed by the board of directors of some
subsidiaries are as follows:

Dividends
Number Per share Total
Investee company of shares (€) (€ million)
Ferrari N.V. 44,435,280 1.362 61
Stellantis N.V. 449,410,092 1.04 467

CNH Industrial N.V. 366,927,900 0.28 103

Exor's share of dividends 631

Demerger between CNH Industrial and lveco Group

Effective 1 January 2022 the Commercial and Specialty Vehicles, Powertrain and related Financial Services
businesses were separated from CNH Industrial. lveco Group became a public listed company independent from
CNH Industrial and, from 3 January 2022, its common shares are traded on Euronext Milan. Each holder of
common shares in the share capital of CNH Industrial received one common share of Iveco Group for every five
CNH Industrial common shares held. Exor, which continues to be the shareholder of reference in both entities
following completion of the spin-off process, holding 366,927,900 common shares CNH Industrial, received
73,385,580 Iveco Group common shares (a 27.06% stake) and the same number of special voting shares. As the
demerger is a “business combination involving entities or businesses under common control’, it is outside the
scope of application of IFRS 3 — Business Combinations and IFRIC 17 — Distributions of Non-cash Assets to
Owners. Accordingly, in Exor's 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements, the opening position at 1 January 2022 for
items in the statement of financial position (relative to CNH Industrial post-demerger and Iveco Group), will be
equivalent to the carrying amounts of CNH Industrial pre-demerger at 31 December 2021.

Increased voting rights related to Exor's stake in Juventus Football Club

As of 3 January 2022, after an uninterrupted period of 24 months during which its shares in Juventus were
maintained registered in the special list, in accordance with the company's voting rights regulations, Exor increased
voting rights in Juventus and currently holds 77.874% of the voting rights.

Settlement with the Italian Tax Authorities

On 18 February 2022 Exor settled with the Italian Tax Authorities (“Agenzia delle Entrate”) a complex tax issue,
specifically related to the exit tax due by the Italian registered company Exor S.p.A. that in December 2016 merged
with its Dutch subsidiary Exor Holding N.V. to create today’s Exor domiciled fiscally in the Netherlands.

Exor remains convinced that it acted in accordance with the rules; however, with the objective of avoiding the time
and the costs of a major tax dispute, it agreed to enter into a settlement with the Agenzia delle Entrate and paid
€746 million, of which €104 million represented by interest.

The effect of the settlement, which was paid in full on 18 February 2022, has been reflected in the Company’s 2021
accounts, to the extent applicable.

Cash consideration for the sale of PartnerRe to Covéa increased by $328 million

The agreed cash consideration of $9.0 billion to be paid by Covéa on the closing of the transaction was based on a
consolidated common shareholders’ equity value of $7.0 billion. Based on PartnerRe's common shareholders'
equity at 31 December 2021, the agreed cash consideration will be adjusted, as per the agreed terms, to include
additional proceeds for around $328 million (of which $150 million paid by Covéa and $178 million paid by
PartnerRe as a special dividend).

60 | BOARD REPORT
Exor buyback program

On 8 March 2022 Exor launched a share buyback program that will involve from time to time the repurchase of up
to €500 million of ordinary shares by 2024 (the "Program"), in line with the disclosure made at the 2021 Investor
Day. Exor started the repurchase of up to €100 million, as the first tranche of the Program, to be executed on
Euronext Milan through a non-discretionary buyback agreement with a primary financial institution. The shares that
are being repurchased will be cancelled.

The Program will be conducted in the framework of the resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders (“AGM”) held on 27 May 2021. The shares will be repurchased at a price not higher than 10% above
the reference price recorded on the day before each transaction is made.

The repurchases will be carried out in compliance with applicable rules and regulations, including the Market Abuse
Regulation 596/2014 and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052.

Conflict between Russia and Ukraine

The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is causing a severe humanitarian crisis involving millions of people. Exor
expresses solidarity with all who are and will be suffering the consequences.

In response to these events the EU, the United States and the United Kingdom, among other countries, imposed
sanctions against certain Russian individuals and entities. Potential effects at a global scale include supply chain
disruptions, rises in commodity prices, inflationary pressures and volatility in the capital markets.

Exor’s subsidiaries have conducted business in jurisdictions that may be subject to trade or economic sanctions
and such sanctions could be expanded. Exor and its subsidiaries will continue to comply with and implement
sanction regimes or other similar laws or regulations.

Exor acknowledges the high uncertainty regarding the duration, outcome and long-lasting consequences of the
conflict. The overall effect of these factors on Exor’s business cannot be estimated with a sufficient degree of
confidence, and Exor will continue to monitor closely the developments.

2022 Outlook
Exor N.V. does not prepare budgets or business plans, nor does it publish forecast data or data on the basis of
which it is possible to calculate forecast data.

Certain Exor operating companies (Ferrari, Stellantis and CNH Industrial) publish forecast data on their
performance, while other operating companies (PartnerRe and Juventus Football Club) publish information on the
foreseeable outlook. Additional information is provided under “Review of performance of the main operating
companies’ in the Board Report.

The forecast data and information of the above mentioned operating companies are drawn up autonomously and
communicated by the respective companies and are not homogeneous. Quantitative forecast disclosures prepared
by these operating companies and the type of information provided, as well as the underlying assumptions and
calculation methods vary according to the accounting principles applicable to each subsidiary and the conventional
application practices in the respective sector of reference.

Exor N.V. in fact, is a holding company without a specific business of reference, head of a diversified and non-
integrated group that operates in different segments and does not exercise direction and coordination activities
over its companies, which operate in a completely independent manner.

Exor N.V. deems that the forecasted data and information of the companies are not significant or suitable for the
purposes of providing indications about the prospective economic trend of Exor N.V.’s operations, nor represent a
forecast or estimate of the company’s results. Therefore, in assessing Exor N.V.’s future prospects it is not possible
to rely on the data and prospective information published by the aforesaid operating companies.

MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE

Introduction

EXOR N.V. (“Exor N.V” or "Exor" or the “Company”) is a public limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap),
incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and its shares are listed in Italy on the Euronext Milan. The
Company’s legal and tax residence is in the Netherlands.

Capital Structure

Structure of share capital

Share class Number of shares Listing market Rights and obligations
Ordinary shares' 241,000,000 Euronext

1 The ordinary shares are registered shares, freely transferable and issued in electronic form. Shares are managed through the centralized clearing system
organized by Monte Titoli.

As of 31 December 2021 the Company held 9,291,244 of its own ordinary shares as treasury stock.

Economic and administrative rights

Each Exor ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote at general meetings of shareholders — ordinary and
extraordinary — as well as to the economic and administrative rights according to the applicable provisions of law
and of the Company’s articles of association (the “Articles of Association”).

Issuance of shares

Shares may be issued pursuant to a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders. This competence concerns
all non-issued shares of the Company’s authorized capital, except insofar as the competence to issue shares is
vested in the board of directors (the “Board of Directors”) by a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders to
this extent.

Shares may be issued pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, if and insofar as the Board of Directors is
designated to do so by the general meeting of shareholders. Such designation can be made each time for a
maximum period of five years and can be extended each time for a maximum period of five years. A designation
must determine the number of shares of each class concerned which may be issued pursuant to a resolution of the
Board of Directors. A resolution of the general meeting of shareholders to designate the Board of Directors as a
body of the Company authorized to issue shares can only be withdrawn upon proposal of the Board of Directors.
By means of the resolution adopted by the general meeting on 27 May 2021, the Board of Directors has been
designated as the competent body to issue ordinary shares and to grant rights to subscribe for shares for a term of
five (5) years with effect from 27 May 2021. The Board of Directors has been authorized to increase the share
capital with such number of shares for a nominal value up to five million Euro (Euro 5,000,000.00) and to issue
convertible bonds for an aggregate issue price up to one billion Euro (Euro 1,000,000,000.00), and to issue the
underlying ordinary shares (or granting of rights to subscribe for such underlying ordinary shares) pursuant to the
applicable conversion ratio.

Payment for shares shall be made in cash unless another form of consideration has been agreed. Payment in a
currency other than Euro may only be made with the consent of the Company.

Upon the issuance of ordinary shares, each holder of ordinary shares will have pre-emptive rights in proportion to
the aggregate nominal value of his ordinary shares. A shareholder will not have pre-emptive rights in respect of
ordinary shares issued against a non-cash contribution. Nor will the shareholder have pre-emptive rights in respect
of ordinary shares issued to employees of the Company or of a group company (groepsmaatschappij).

Prior to each individual issuance of ordinary shares, pre-emptive rights may be restricted or excluded by a
resolution of the general meeting of shareholders. However, with respect to an issue of ordinary shares pursuant to
a resolution of the Board of Directors, the pre-emptive rights can be restricted or excluded pursuant to a resolution
of the Board of Directors if and insofar as the Board of Directors is designated to do so by the general meeting of
shareholders. By means of the resolution adopted by the general meeting on 27 May 2021, the Board of Directors
has been authorized to limit or exclude pre-emptive rights of shareholders when issuing ordinary shares or granting
rights to subscribe for ordinary shares for a term of five (5) years with effect from 27 May 2021.

64 | BOARD REPORT
Holders of Special Voting Shares have no pre-emptive rights on the issuance of shares of any class and with
respect to the issuance of Special Voting Shares no pre-emptive rights exist.

The general meeting of shareholders or the Board of Directors, as the case may be, shall decide — when passing
the resolution to issue shares or rights to subscribe for shares — in which manner the shares shall be issued and, to
the extent that rights of pre-emption apply, within what period those rights may be exercised.

Special Voting Structure

In order to foster the development and continued involvement of a core and stable base of long-term shareholders
in a manner that reinforces the group’s stability, as well as providing Exor with enhanced flexibility when pursuing
strategic investment opportunities in the future, the Articles of Association provide for a special-voting structure (the
“Special Voting Structure”). The purpose of the Special Voting Structure is to reward long-term ownership of Exor
ordinary shares by granting long-term Exor shareholders with special voting shares to which multiple voting rights
are attached additional to the right granted by each Exor ordinary share held.

More precisely, according to the Special Voting Structure:

(i) after 5 years of uninterrupted ownership of Exor ordinary shares held in the Loyalty Register (as defined
below), each Exor shareholder will be entitled to 5 voting rights for each Exor ordinary share and, to this
purpose, will receive — and Exor will issue — one special voting share, to which 4 voting rights are attached,
and with a nominal value of Euro 0.04 (“Special Voting Share-A”), additional to each Exor ordinary share
owned (to which 1 voting right is attached); and

(ii) after 10 years of uninterrupted ownership of Exor ordinary shares held in the Loyalty Register (as defined
below), each Exor shareholder will be entitled to 10 votes for each Exor ordinary share and, to this
purpose, each Special Voting Share-A held will be converted into one special voting share B, to which 9
voting rights are attached, and with a nominal value of Euro 0.09 (“Special Voting Share-B”), additional to
each Exor ordinary share owned (to which 1 voting right is attached).

Special Voting Shares-A and Special Voting Shares-B, which are collectively referred to as “Special Voting Shares”,
will not be tradable and will have only minimal economic entitlements.

Application for Special Voting Shares — Loyalty Register

A shareholder may at any time opt to become eligible for Special Voting Shares by requesting the agent (the
“Agent”) referred to Article 3.3 of the Terms and Conditions for Special Voting Shares (the “SVS Terms”), acting on
behalf of the Company, to register one or more ordinary shares in the loyalty register (the “Loyalty Register’)
maintained by the Company pursuant to the SVS Terms. Such request will need to be made by the relevant
shareholder via its intermediary, by submitting (i) a duly completed form (the “Election Form”) and (ii) an
intermediary confirmation statement attesting the uninterrupted holding of Exor ordinary shares, pursuant to the
SVS Terms.

Together with the Election Form, the relevant shareholder must submit a duly signed power of attorney, irrevocably
instructing and authorizing the Agent to act on his behalf and to represent him in connection with the issuance,
allocation, acquisition, conversion, sale, repurchase and transfer of Special Voting Shares in accordance with and
pursuant to the SVS Terms (the “Power of Attorney’).

Upon receipt of the Election Form, the intermediary’s confirmation and the Power of Attorney, the Agent will
examine the same and use its reasonable efforts to inform the relevant shareholder, through his intermediary, as to
whether the request is accepted or rejected (and, if rejected, the reasons why) within ten business days of receipt
of the above-mentioned documents. The Agent may reject a request for reasons of incompleteness or
incorrectness of the Election Form, the Power of Attorney or the broker’s confirmation or in case of serious doubts
with respect to the validity or authenticity of such documents. If the Agent requires further information from the
relevant shareholder in order to process the request, then such shareholder shall provide all necessary information
and assistance required by the Agent in connection therewith.

Exor ordinary shares for which a shareholder has issued a request for registration in the Loyalty Register — as well
as ordinary shares already registered — are referred to as “Electing Ordinary Shares”.

BOARD REPORT | 65
Transfer of Electing Ordinary Shares, Qualifying Ordinary Shares and Special Voting Shares; removal from the
Loyalty Register

According to the SVS Terms and during the time in which Electing Ordinary Shares or Qualifying Ordinary Shares
are held in the Loyalty Register, these cannot be sold, disposed of or transferred unless to a Loyalty Transferee.

No shareholder shall, directly or indirectly, (a) sell, dispose of or transfer any Special Voting Share or otherwise
grant any right or interest therein, unless the shareholder is obliged to transfer Special Voting Shares to a Loyalty
Transferee, or (b) create or permit to exist any pledge, lien, fixed or floating charge or other encumbrance over any
Special Voting Share or any interest in any Special Voting Share.

As described above, anyone holding Electing Ordinary Shares or Qualifying Ordinary Shares may request at any
time that all or part of their Electing Ordinary Shares or Qualifying Ordinary Shares be removed from the Loyalty
Register and be transferred to the ordinary trading system, so as to enable the shareholder to freely dispose of
their Exor shares as indicated below. Starting from the time the above mentioned request is made, it shall be
considered that the person holding Qualifying Ordinary Shares has waived the attribution of the voting rights
associated with the Special Voting Shares issued and attributed in relation to the Qualifying Ordinary Shares.

Each of the above mentioned requests shall result in a compulsory transfer by effect of which the Special Voting
Shares shall be offered and transferred to Exor without any consideration (om niet) under the Articles of Association
and the SVS Terms. Exor may keep the Special Voting Shares as treasury shares, but shall not be entitled to
exercise the related voting rights. Alternatively, Exor may withdraw and cancel the Special Voting Shares and by
this effect the nominal value of those shares shall be allocated to the special capital reserve of Exor. Therefore, the
voting rights embodied in Special Voting Shares shall cease to apply with reference to the related Qualifying
Ordinary Shares removed from the Loyalty Register.

Each shareholder holding Qualifying Ordinary Shares shall promptly notify Exor about the occurrence of an event
of Change of Control (as defined under the SVS Terms) which concerns the same. A shareholder’s Change of
Control causes the related Qualifying Ordinary Shares to be removed from the Loyalty Register. The voting rights
attaching to Special Voting Shares and assigned in relation to the corresponding Qualifying Ordinary Shares shall
be suspended with immediate effect as a result of any event of Change of Control, directly or indirectly, related to
each holder of Qualifying Ordinary Shares held in the Loyalty Register.

Other characteristics of Special Voting Shares

Issuance of Special Voting Shares does not require qualified shareholders to pay up their nominal value to Exor.
Pursuant to Article 13.4 of the Articles of Association, Exor maintains a separate reserve (the “Special Capital
Reserve”) to pay-up Special Voting Shares. The Board of Directors is authorized to credit or debit the Special
Capital Reserve at the expense or in favour of the Company’s general share premium reserve. If the Board of
Directors so decides, Special Voting Shares can be issued at the expense of the Special Capital Reserve in lieu of
an actual payment for the shares concerned.

However, the holder of Special Voting Shares issued at the expense of the Special Capital Reserve may at any
time substitute the charge of the Special Capital Reserve by making an actual payment to the Company in respect
of the shares concerned (in accordance with payment instructions provided by the Board of Directors on request) in
an amount equal to the nominal value of such Special Voting Shares (such shares being defined as “Special Voting
Shares paid-up in cash’).

As anticipated, Special Voting Shares have minimal economic entitlement. Under Dutch law, in fact, Special Voting
Shares cannot be excluded — as a whole — from the assignment of economic rights. Consequently, in accordance
with Article 28.2 of the Articles of Association, holders of Special Voting Shares paid-up in cash will be entitled to
the payment of an annual dividend equal to one per cent (1%) of the amount actually paid for such shares in
accordance with the above, provided, however, that profits realized with respect to the financial year concerned are
not fully appropriated to increase and/or form reserves. Actual payments made during the financial year to which
the dividend relates will not be counted.

66 | BOARD REPORT
In case of liquidation of the Company, out of the balance remaining after payment of its debts, the following
payments will be proceeded:

— firstly, the amounts actually paid-in on Special Voting Shares in accordance with Article 13.5 of the Articles of
Association will be transferred to those holders of Special Voting Shares whose Special Voting Shares have so
been actually paid for; and

— secondly, the balance remaining will be transferred to the holders of ordinary shares in proportion to the
aggregate number of the ordinary shares held by each of them.

Pursuant to Article 11 of the SVS Terms, in the event of a breach of any of the obligations of a shareholder, that
shareholder must pay to the Company an amount for each Special Voting Share affected by the relevant breach
(the “Compensation Amount”), which amount is the average closing price of an ordinary share on Euronext Milan
calculated on the basis of the period of twenty (20) trading days prior to the day of the breach or, if such day is not
a business day, the preceding business day, such without prejudice to the Company’s right to request specific
performance.

Pursuant to Article 12 of the SVS Terms, the SVS Terms may be amended pursuant to a resolution by the Board of
Directors, provided, however, that any material, not merely technical amendment will be subject to the approval of
the general meeting of shareholders of Exor, unless such amendment is required to ensure compliance with
applicable laws or listing regulations.

Allocation of Special Voting Shares

As per the date on which an Exor ordinary share has been registered in the Loyalty Register in the name of one
and the same shareholder or its Loyalty Transferee (as defined under the SVS Terms) for an uninterrupted period
of five years (the “SVS A Qualification Date”), such Electing Ordinary Share will become a “Qualifying Ordinary
Share A” and the holder thereof will be entitled to acquire one Special Voting Share A in respect of each of such
Qualifying Ordinary Share A.

As per the date on which an Exor ordinary share has been registered in the Loyalty Register in the name of one
and the same shareholder or its Loyalty Transferee for an uninterrupted period of ten years (the “SVS B
Qualification Date”), such Electing Ordinary Share — which, in the meantime, will have become a Qualifying
Ordinary Share A — will become a “Qualifying Ordinary Share B”. Qualifying Ordinary Shares A and Qualifying
Ordinary Shares B are collectively referred to as “Qualifying Ordinary Shares”.

On the SVS B Qualification Date, the Agent will, on behalf of the Company, issue a conversion statement pursuant
to which the Special Voting Shares A corresponding to the number of Qualifying Ordinary Shares B will
automatically convert into an equal number of Special Voting Shares B.

On 13 December 2021, after (five) 5 years of registration in the Loyalty Register, the Electing Ordinary Shares held
by Giovanni Agnelli B.V. became Qualifying Ordinary Shares A and Giovanni Agnelli B.V. became entitled to acquire
one Special Voting Share A in respect of each of such Qualifying Ordinary Share A. On 13 December 2021, Exor
issued 124,717,132 Special Voting Shares A allocated to Giovanni Agnelli B.V., now holding 85.44% of voting rights
on outstanding capital and 84.37% of voting rights on issued capital.

Repurchase of Shares

The authorization of the Board of Directors to repurchase its own fully paid-up ordinary shares, up to the maximum
number of ordinary shares that can be repurchased under Dutch law, and further within the limits of Dutch law,
applicable regulations and the Company’s Articles of Association, has been extended, by the annual general
meeting of shareholders held on 27 May 2021 for a term of 18 months, starting from the date thereof.

Restrictions on the transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of Exor ordinary shares, no limitations on ownership and no clauses
requiring acceptance on the part of the Company or of other shareholders upon a transfer of shares.

The above shall not apply to transfers of Special Voting Shares or Electing Ordinary Shares or Qualifying Ordinary
Shares: for such provisions, reference is made to the section above.

BOARD REPORT |67
Restrictions on voting rights
There are no restrictions on voting rights.

Shareholders

Significant shareholdings

Based on the regulatory filings with the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financiéle
Markten, the “AFM”) the following entities own at 31 December 2021, directly or indirectly, more than 3% of the
share capital carrying voting rights:

Shareholder % of issued capital
Giovanni Agnelli B.V. 52.01%
Harris Associates LP 4.99%
Baillie Gifford 3.14%
Vanguard Group 3.05%

In total ten shareholders, one of which is Giovanni Agnelli B.V., are registered, for a total amount of 132,228,028
shares, in the Loyalty Register to participate in the Special Voting Structure, as explained above.

Giovanni Agnelli B.V. is the largest shareholder of Exor through its 52.01% shareholding interest in Exor’s issued
capital. Giovanni Agnelli B.V. is a Dutch private company with limited liability and the shares of which are held by
the descendants of Giovanni Agnelli, founder of Fiat. The main business objective is to preserve unity and
continuity of its controlling equity interest in Exor.

Consequently, Giovanni Agnelli B.V. could strongly influence all matters submitted to a vote of Exor’s shareholders,
including approval of annual dividends, election and removal of directors and approval of extraordinary business
transactions.

Employee shareholdings: system for the exercise of voting rights

A specific mechanism for the exercise of voting rights applicable to employees’ shareholdings does not exist. In
particular the voting rights on shares deriving from the vesting of shares or from the exercise of option rights under
stock option plans or incentive plans — for information on which reference should be made to the section
“Remuneration of Directors” — are not subject to any form of restriction and are directly exercisable by the

RISK MANAGEMENT
RISKS AND CONTROL SYSTEM

70 | BOARD REPORT

RISK MANAGEMENT, RISKS AND CONTROL SYSTEM

In compliance with the principles of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, Exor has adequate internal risk
management and control systems in place. To assess the risk affecting the Company’s activities and the
effectiveness of the internal control system, Exor has in place an internal control and risk management system
(the “System’) based on the model provided by the COSO Framework (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission Report — Enterprise Risk Management model) and the principles of the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code. The System consists of a set of policies, procedures, rules and organisational
structures the purpose of which is to provide an adequate process for the identification, measurement,
management and monitoring of the principal risks in order to ensure the reliability, accuracy and timeliness of
financial information, the safeguarding of the Company’s assets, the efficiency and effectiveness of business
processes and the Company’s compliance with laws and regulations. An effective internal control and risk
management system contributes to the conduct of the business in a manner consistent with its pre-established
objectives and facilitates well-informed decision-making. The System is integrated within the organisation and
governance structure adopted by Exor and is developed giving adequate consideration to the reference models
and the best practices available nationally and internationally.

The responsibility for the institution and maintenance of an effective System, which is coherent with Exor’s
business, process objectives and for the corresponding risk management method employed with a pre-
established containment plan, is entrusted to the Board of Directors.

In particular, Exor’s System operates at three levels of internal control:

— First Level: operating areas identification, evaluation and monitoring of applicable risks in the single
processes and the establishment of specific actions managing such risks. At this level the structures
responsible for the individual risks are located, in terms of their identification, measurement and
management, as well as the performance of the necessary checks.

— Second Level: departments responsible for risk control which define methodologies and tools for managing
risks and the monitoring of such risks.

— Third Level: provides an independent and objective assurance of the adequacy and effective operation of
the first and second levels of control and in general of the overall mode of managing risks. This activity is
carried out by the Internal Audit function which operates independently.

The System is subject to annual verification and update in order to ensure its constant suitability as an instrument
of control over the business's principal areas of risk.

The Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of the Company’s System.

Internal control and external control over financial reporting

The System of control over financial reporting is set in a broader framework of internal control and risk
management and has the purpose of ensuring the reliability, accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the
Group’s financial information.

The System of internal controls over financial reporting is focused on the procedures and organisational structures
which ensure the reliability, accuracy, completeness and timeliness of financial reporting.

The System of internal control over financial reporting aims to ensure the adequate and effective application of the
administrative and accounting procedures designed to provide a true and fair representation as well as reliable
information on the business activities in the financial reports (annual consolidated and company only financial
statements and shortened half yearly consolidated financial statements) prepared by the Company.

The approach adopted by the Company for the evaluation, monitoring and continuous updating of the System of
control over financial reporting, is based on a ‘top-down, risk-based’ process consistent with the COSO
Framework (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission Report — Internal Control
Integrated Framework). This enables focus on areas of higher risk and/or materiality, where there is risk of
significant errors, including those attributable to fraud, in the elements of the financial statements and related
documents.

BOARD REPORT | 71
The principal characteristics of the System of control over financial reporting are based on the following
components and phases:

— Identification and assessment of administrative and accounting risks.
— Identification of the controls responding to the risks identified.
— Verification of the effective application of the controls and evaluation of any problems detected.

The Exor System of control over financial reporting has been developed taking into consideration existing law and
the regulations, best practices as well as the guidelines provided by the competent bodies and is composed of the
following administrative and accounting procedures:

— Code of Conduct — which illustrates the ethical principles and values of the Company and must be observed
by Company personnel involved, for any reasons, in the implementation of the System of control over
financial reporting;

— System of delegated powers and proxies — which identifies the powers to represent the Company held by
individual managers;

— Risk Management process — which identifies roles, responsibilities and methodologies in performing the risk
management activity and in the preparation, diffusion and checking of financial reports disclosed to the
market;

— Administrative and accounting procedures — which establish the responsibilities and rules for the process
controls to be applied;

— Financial reporting instructions and closing timetables — which are used to communicate operational
instructions for the preparation of the reporting package;

— The process of internal attestation by the corporate bodies of the significant subsidiaries as regards the data
and the related internal control system under their responsibility reported to the parent company.

Internal control covering the preparation and processing of financial information

Overview of the organisational structure and management of accounting and financial information

The consolidated financial statements of the Exor group are prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations as adopted in the European Union at the balance sheet date, as
described in the annual financial report.

As parent company, EXOR N.V., under the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer defines and oversees the
preparation of reported accounting and financial information of EXOR N.V. and the process related to the financial
information being requested from the operating subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Chief Financial Officer of EXOR N.V.
ensures that the processes for preparing accounting and financial information produce reliable information and
give, in a timely manner, a fair view of the Company’s financial position and results. He obtains and reviews all
information that he deems useful, such as closing assumptions, critical accounting positions and judgments,
changes in accounting method and results of audits performed by the external auditors.

For consolidation purposes, the Chief Financial Officers of operating subsidiaries are responsible for preparing the
reporting packages of such companies in accordance with group instructions. These financial statements are
prepared under the control of their respective Board of Directors and are the responsibility of company
management of each subsidiary. Each reporting package is accompanied with a representation letter in which
management of the subsidiary takes responsibility for the information provided in the consolidation process.

Members of the EXOR N.V. Audit Committee examine the annual and interim financial statements of EXOR N.V.
and monitor the process for preparing accounting and financial information. Their conclusions are based notably
on information produced by the Chief Financial Officer and his team, exchanges with the team during Audit
Committee meetings and the findings of internal audits. The Chair of the Audit Committee reports on the
committee’s work to the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors of EXOR N.V. approves EXOR N.V. consolidated financial statements (interim and annual)
and separate (company) financial statements.

To secure better upward reporting to Exor’s external (statutory) auditors, the Group engages the same auditing
firms for all subsidiaries, to the extent possible. Selection criteria for the statutory auditors includes their ability to
audit all directly- and indirectly-held subsidiaries throughout the world.

72 | BOARD REPORT
Processes for the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information for the consolidated financial
statements

The process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is organised and coordinated under the
responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer.

The consolidated financial statements are produced using a consolidation software configured to automate a
certain number of consistency checks on the data in the reporting packages.

Detailed consolidation instructions are sent before each interim and annual closing to the attention of the finance
departments of the various consolidated subsidiaries.

The closing schedule for accounts and the related instructions are prepared sufficiently in advance to enable the
financial teams of the subsidiaries to organise their procedures and anticipate closing constraints.

The consolidation department looks at uniformity of treatment by examining accounting principles in the financial
statements of each subsidiaries.

Risk Management
Exor has adopted its own Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) system to identify and analyse the main risks
associated with the Company’s activities and the achievement of its objectives.

The Exor ERM system is based on the above mentioned COSO ERM Framework, which defines risk
management as a “process effected by the Board of Directors, management and other personnel, applied in
setting strategy across the organization and designed to identify potential events that may affect the business, in
order to manage the risk within the risk appetite and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement
of the business objectives’. The COSO Framework is based on five areas: the control environment, risk
assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring and supervision.

The Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control and ERM system and, together
with executive management, performs a thorough exercise for the identification of the main risks and their ranking.
In 2020 a detailed risk assessment and update of the risk profile, as well as a re-assessment of the relevant risks
and risk appetite has been performed, especially in view of the developments caused by COVID-19. In 2021, the
annual risk assessment has been performed in which the 2020 outcome has been re-evaluated and updated. Risk
Appetite indicators (Risk Category & Measurement & Tolerance Level) have been reviewed and confirmed for
2021 and onwards.

The ERM system is integrated within the Company’s organisation and corporate governance, supporting the
efficiency and effectiveness of business processes, the reliability of financial information and compliance with laws
and regulations. An effective ERM system contributes to the conduct of the business in a manner consistent with
its objectives and facilitates well-informed decision-making.

In this context, the Board of Directors is responsible for the identification of the risks to which Exor and the
“Holdings System” are exposed in relation to the business objectives and Company characteristics, and for
performing an assessment of the possible risk scenarios mitigation, considering the effectiveness of the control
process currently in place.

Risks related to the companies are identified and addressed by the companies themselves, within the framework
of their own internal control. Exor, through the participation in the respective Boards, supports the adoption of a
sound internal control environment.

The Exor ERM system is subject to verification and update over time in order to ensure its constant suitability as
an instrument of control over the business’s principal areas of risk.

The assessment of the controls may require the definition of compensating controls and plans for mitigation and
improvement. The results of monitoring are subject to periodic review by management and are communicated to
the Audit Committee (which in return reports to the Board of Directors).

Risk Appetite
Exor set its risk appetite within risk taking and risk acceptance parameters which are driven by applicable laws,

the Code of Conduct, core principles and values, corporate policies and directives.
BOARD REPORT | 73
Exor operates within a moderate overall risk range, inherent to its activities and strategy. In this context, Exor’s
highest risk appetite relates to the strategic and operational objectives related to a positive Net Asset Value (NAV)
per share / MSCI ratio in the long term and maintaining an adequate credit rating and cash flow to enable
continuity of investment activities, while ensuring in any case the compliance with the criteria that direct Exor
investment choices.

Exor’s lowest risk appetite relates to the objectives of protecting the Group reputation, compliance with the rules
and regulations and of accuracy and reliability of the financial reporting. Meeting applicable legal and regulatory
obligations will take priority over other business objectives.

The Exor risk management and internal control system comprises a structured process aimed at addressing
individual risk categories, with a defined risk appetite applied to each category as detailed below:

Exor has established the appetite for principal risks, identifying its overall risk capacity and appetite position.

Risk metrics for each principal risk have been identified in order to put in place monitoring activity and corrective
mitigation actions, if needed.

Key risks and key trends

As a part of the 2021 risk assessment process, management performed an update of the previous Risk
Assessment. Based on the potential business impact and likelihood of occurrence, as well as existing and/or
planned countermeasures (mitigating actions) the risks have been reviewed and updated where needed.

74 | BOARD REPORT
The risk impact could result in a material direct or indirect adverse effect on its business, operations, financial
condition and performance, reputation and/or other interests. The results of this assessment were presented to
the Audit Committee on 7 September 2021 and to the Board of Directors on 17 November 2021.

Exor expects that the implemented (internal and external) controls will mitigate the risks up to the level of the risk

appetite.

The summary table below is intended to present an overview of the main risks identified and the related mitigant
activities in place. The sequence in which these risks are presented does not reflect any order of importance,

likelihood or materiality.

Risk Event

Risk Description

Control/Mitigation Activities

Dividend risk (Cash Flow)

(Financial risk)

Risk of holding investments in companies that do not
pay sufficient dividend to recover the operating costs,
net financial expenses of Exor and to have free cash
flow to invest and/or to reduce the debt over time.

Careful management of cash in / cash out and
investment portfolio diversification. Exor maintains an
adequate cash flow management by performing cash
flow analysis, adjusting and monitoring the flows ona
regular basis.

Exor is engaged in continuous dialogue with the
companies through presence in the Board.

The Company risk management approach mixes a wide
variety of investments within the portfolio thus mitigating
unsystematic risk events in the collection of dividends
from the investments.

Portfolio composition

(Strategic/operational
risk)

Risk that investment decisions do not allow Exor to (i)
define an adequate portfolio mix in terms of
diversification of the investments, resulting in difficulties
in optimising the Group's future performance; (ii) obtain
a return on investments that will increase the Net Asset
Value (NAV), surpassing the MSCI World Index in USD;
and (iii) limit the impact of climate change adverse
development on the overall portfolio performance.

The Company risk management approach mixes a wide
variety of investments within the portfolio. The
Company portfolio consists of different kinds of
investments, consequently characterised by an overall
lower risk level.

Company investment procedures ensure adequate
evaluation also in relation to portfolio composition.

Stock market
performance

(Strategic risk)

Risk that fluctuations in the stock market can affect the
value of investments.

Asset allocation. The Company risk management
approach mixes a wide variety of investments within the
portfolio. The Company portfolio is composed of
diversified and different kinds of investment,
consequently characterised by an overall lower risk
level.

The diversification by sector and geography for
example mitigates unsystematic risk events in the
portfolio, so the positive performance of some
investments neutralises the negative performance of
others.

Financial structure /
availability of cash

(Financial risk)

Risk related to the financial structure with a potential
increase in financial costs for Exor and not having
sufficient credit available to catch investment
opportunities and/or to assists in case of financial
difficulties of the subsidiaries.

Careful management of cash in / cash out and
investment portfolio diversification. Exor maintains an
adequate cash flow management by performing cash
flow analysis, adjusting and monitoring the flows ona
regular basis.

The Company diversifies the sources of financing and
manages the maturity and the cost through active
liability management.

General state of the
economy / potential
changes in the economic,
social or political
environment

(Financial risk)

Risk related to developments in the political /
economic / social environment (e.g. legislation,
nationalisation, terrorism, general state of the economy,
transition to lower carbon economy, supply chain
disruption) of the countries where the Company and/or
the subsidiaries operate, with potential adverse effects
on the businesses in which they operate.

The Company risk management approach and
investment procedures ensure diversification of the
portfolio and global presence of the operating
subsidiaries.

BOARD REPORT | 75

Other risk factors‘
Based on the regular assessment performed by Exor, this section provides a list of other risk factors that may be
considered relevant apart from the main risks disclosed above.

The following risk factors, in the judgement of the Board of Directors, are deemed relevant to the expectation of
the Company’s continuity for the period of twelve months after the preparation of the Board Report.

As a long-term investor, Exor is also vigilant with regard to the occurrence of emerging risks which, without
constituting specific risks at this stage, are the subject of particular attention. As such, the climate risk (i.e. the
impact that global warming could have on its business or that of its portfolio companies) is considered. The
transformation of working methods with the rise of remote working is likely to pose new risks in terms of both
cyber security and attractiveness and talent retention. Other risks, of which Exor is unaware as of the date of this
document, may also exist or arise.

Exor indirectly faces specific risks related to the companies, which are identified and addressed by the companies
themselves within the framework of their own internal control. The analysis conducted by these entities in terms of
risk identification and internal control is described in the reference documents available on their website.

RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS, STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS

Risks relating to international markets and exposure to changes in local conditions and trade policies, as
well as economic, geopolitical or other events

Exor’s earnings and financial position, and those of its subsidiaries and associates, are particularly influenced by
the general state of the economy in the countries in which they operate and by the variables which affect
performance, including increases or decreases in gross national product, access to credit, the level of consumer
and business confidence, the cost of raw materials and the rate of unemployment. The principal sectors of
business are also subject to highly cyclical demand and tend to reflect the overall performance of the economy, in
certain cases even amplifying the effects of economic trends.

Moreover, the evolution of world monetary and financial market conditions and the associated uncertainties,
especially in emerging markets, could adversely affect present economic conditions.

The principal risks associated with a slowdown in the markets in which Exor’s investments operate comprise
increases in energy prices and fluctuations in raw materials or possible contractions in infrastructure spending. In
addition, in the Eurozone, unemployment remains significant, and a slow or inefficient implementation of structural
reforms and budget adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to hamper the pace of the recovery.
Exor is also susceptible to risks relating to epidemics and pandemics of diseases. The outbreak of coronavirus
COVID-19, a virus causing potentially deadly respiratory tract infections, which was declared a global pandemic
by the World Health Organization in March 2020, led to governments around the world mandating increasingly
restrictive measures to contain the pandemic, including social distancing, quarantine, “stay-at-home” or similar
orders, travel restrictions and suspension of non-essential business activities.

Notwithstanding, the ultimate impact of the pandemic on Exor’s business, results of operations and financial
condition will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that Exor is not able to predict,
including the ultimate duration, spread and severity of the outbreak and potential subsequent waves (e.g. delta
and Omicron variant), the ultimate extent and duration of the effect on the global economy and how quickly and to
what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.

The ongoing coronavirus pandemic and any possible future outbreaks of other viruses may have a significant
adverse effect on Exor and its capability to fully achieve its investing strategies and cause delays in the
completion, or failure to complete, any acquisition, disposal, merger, joint venture or similar transaction.

Exor may also be exposed through its investments to any market downturn arising in connection with the UK's exit
from the European Union (Brexit). The United Kingdom (UK) left the European Union (EU) on 31 January 2020
and the transition period ended on 31 December 2020. The precise impact of the future relationship between the
UK and the EU on the business of Exor is difficult to determine.

‘ This section is not intended to provide a full list of all of the Exor’s risk factors.

76 | BOARD REPORT
Although Exor does not believe Brexit will have a direct material impact on its financial position, the form of Brexit
remains uncertain and may result in greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU countries,
a fluctuation in currency exchange rates and additional regulatory complexity as well as further global economic
uncertainty, all of which could have a material adverse effect.

The exit of the United Kingdom (or any other country following the example of the United Kingdom) from the
European Union, the potential decision of any European country that adopted the Euro to adopt a different
currency, or prolonged periods of uncertainty connected to these circumstances could have significant negative
impacts on international markets, including further declines in stock exchange indices and in the value of Sterling
and the Euro and/or greater volatility of markets in general due to the increased uncertainty, with possible negative
consequences on Exor and/or Exor’s investments, operating results, capital and financial condition.

In addition to the above and given that there is currently no legal procedure or practice aimed at facilitating the exit
of a Member State from the Euro, the consequences of these decisions are exacerbated by the uncertainty
regarding the methods by which a Member State could manage its current assets and liabilities denominated in
Euros and the exchange rate between the newly adopted currency and the Euro. A collapse of the Eurozone could
be accompanied by the deterioration of the economic and financial situation of the European Union and could
have a significant negative effect on the entire financial sector, creating new difficulties in the granting of sovereign
loans and loans to businesses and involving considerable changes to financial activities both at market and retail
level. Should this occur, Exor and/or Exor’s investments, financial condition and results of operations would be
materially adversely affected.

New or revised agreements between the United States and its trading partners may also impact business and
potential changes in tax laws that could adversely affect US operations. These developments have introduced an
elevated level of economic and policy uncertainty and could have a material adverse effect on business, financial
condition and results of operations. Such developments could cause financial and capital markets within and
outside the US and Europe to constrict, thereby negatively impacting Exor’s ability to finance its business.

The rapidly escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine led to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on
24 February 2022 and represent a tragedy to the people. In response to these events, certain regions (including
the United States, the United Kingdom and the EU) imposed sanctions against certain Russian individuals and
entities. Moreover, there is further disruption imposed on people and economic activity both at a regional and
global scale across all sectors such as supply chains, commodity prices and exchange rates, in addition to
volatility of the global markets and financial system. Exor’s subsidiaries have conducted business in jurisdictions
that may be subject to trade or economic sanctions and such sanctions could be expanded. If Exor and its
subsidiaries fails to comply with sanction regimes or other similar laws or regulations, they could be subject to
damages and potentially other financial penalties, suspension of licenses, or a cessation of operations at its
businesses, as well as damage to its brands’ images and reputations. The overall effect of these factors on Exor’s
business cannot be estimated with a sufficient degree of confidence. Exor will continue to closely monitor the
developments.

It is therefore not possible to provide an accurate indication of the future trends of the above factors and variables
which may have an adverse impact on the demand for products and services, earnings, business prospects and
the financial position of Exor and its subsidiaries and associated.

Risks relating to the business, operations and profitability of Exor

The composition of Exor’s investment portfolio may vary substantially from time to time. Maintaining long-term
ownership in investments and a flow of investments and divestments in new investment activities involves
commercial risk, such as having a high exposure to a certain industry or an individual holding, changed market
conditions for finding attractive investment candidates or barriers that arise and prevent exit from a holding at the
chosen time.

BOARD REPORT | 77
Exor does not have operations or significant assets other than the capital stock of its subsidiaries and other
intercompany balances. Exor has cash outflows in the form of other expenses, payments on its indebtedness and
dividends to its shareholders. Exor relies primarily on cash dividends and payments from its subsidiaries to meet
its cash outflows. In particular, Exor does not have a significant operating business of its own and, accordingly,
Exor’s financial condition depends upon the results of its investment activities, including the receipt of funds by
other members of the Group. Exor expects future dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries to
be the principal source of funds to repay its indebtedness and to pay expenses and dividends. The ability of Exor's
subsidiaries to make such payments (in the form of dividends and intercompany payments) depends on their
economic performance and financial condition and may also be limited by contractual or regulatory constraints. No
assurance can be given that Exor will receive adequate funding to maintain its financial condition.

The financial results of the Exor Group and of Exor are no indicators of the future profitability of Exor. For the 2021
financial statements, the Group’s assessment is that no material uncertainties (as defined in paragraph 25 of
IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements) exist about its ability to continue as a going concern.

There can be no assurance concerning the profitability of Exor in future periods.

Risks associated with the distribution of dividends

The distribution of dividends by Exor and the amount of such dividends depend on the Company’s future profits
which in turn depend on the dividends distributed by Exor’s subsidiaries and associates and on the gains realised
on divestment of these companies, events which by their nature are neither periodic nor recurrent.

The failure to achieve the objectives of the business plans of subsidiaries and associates due to, among other
things, deterioration of economic and financial conditions and of the general conditions of the market, may have a
significant negative effect on the economic results and financial position of Exor’s subsidiaries and associates and
affect their capability to pay dividend to Exor.

Therefore, no assurance can be given with regard to the fact that Exor will receive constant flows of dividends
from the subsidiaries and associates which depend on the economic and financial performance and the
investment and dividend policies of such companies.

Accordingly, Exor’s results in different financial years may not be regular and/or comparable. Where investments
have been made having recourse to debt financing, part of the resources arising from the divestment will, as a
priority, be applied in repayment of such debt and only the remaining part may be used for the distribution of
dividends. n addition, Exor or its investments may be bound contractually or otherwise to not distribute dividends
or to distribute limited dividends in certain circumstances or periods. It will be recalled that the dividends
distribution by PartnerRe depends also on capital requirements, including regulatory requirements.

Further, Exor does not have a policy for the payment of dividends (for example a minimum distribution per share in
absolute terms or as a percentage-dividend payout) and has not made any specific undertaking in this respect.

Risks relating to Exor’s credit rating

Exor's corporate credit rating from S&P is currently “BBB+” for long-term debt and “A-2” for short-term debt with a
stable outlook. Its ability to access capital markets, and the cost of borrowing in those markets, is highly
dependent on its credit ratings. The rating agencies may review their ratings for possible downgrades, and any
downgrades would increase Exor’s cost of capital, potentially limiting its access to sources of financing, and could
negatively affect its businesses.

Risks associated with market conditions

Exor holds investments in both publicly listed companies and unlisted companies. The value of the investments in
listed companies is based on their market prices, whereas for investments in unlisted companies one of the
methods used to value the shareholdings is based on multiples of comparable listed companies. Therefore,
changes in prices and market conditions can negatively impact the value of Exor’s business operations. A
substantial weakening of equity and/or bond markets or changes in interest rates and/or currency exchange rates
could impact negatively on the value of Exor’s investments.

Further, the operating costs which Exor incurs cannot be reduced with the same speed as a fall or unabated
decline in financial markets and, in the case of inadequately efficient cost management, this could negatively
impact the financial results of Exor.

78 | BOARD REPORT
Risks associated with the sectors and markets in which Exor’s subsidiaries and associates operate
Through its investments in subsidiaries and associates, Exor currently operates mainly in the sectors of
reinsurance (PartnerRe), automobile (Stellantis), trucks, commercial vehicles, buses (lveco Group, spun off from
CNH Industrial in January 2022), tractors, agricultural and construction equipment (CNH Industrial), performance
and luxury cars (Ferrari), media, publishing and editorial (GEDI and The Economist Group) and professional
football (Juventus Football Club). As a result, Exor is exposed to the risks typical of the sectors and markets in
which such subsidiaries and associates operate. Therefore, the performance of the main subsidiaries has a very
significant impact on the earnings, financial position and cash flows of Exor.

In the football industry, revenues are driven by the performance of football teams. Therefore, revenues of football
teams may vary significantly depending on their participation and performance in domestic and international
competitions. Also, business and financial performances are affected significantly by transactions made as part of
the transfer campaign and the management of a player’s registrations rights. A significant portion of the revenues
of Juventus includes, but is not limited to, its broadcasting and media rights, the management of its brand,
sponsorship and advertising market.

Revenues deriving from such activities may be affected by various circumstances, such as future changes to the
rules and criteria set out both at national and European level to govern the distribution of the broadcasting and
media rights and by events in the football industry that, even if unrelated to Juventus, may negatively affect its
brand or reputation. Juventus’ sponsorship and advertising revenues are also affected by the terms and conditions
of the relevant sponsorship and advertising agreements; when the current agreements expire, Juventus may not
be able to renew or replace them with contracts on similar or better terms.

In respect of the editorial, publishing and media industry, companies operating in the sector derive substantial
revenues from the sale of advertising on newspapers, inserts and websites. Expenditures by advertisers tend to
be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and buying patterns. In addition, newer technologies and free-
press are increasing the number of media available to audiences and may cause changes in consumer behaviour
that could affect the attractiveness of the media and publishing industries’ offerings, both to advertisers and to the
public generally, which could have an adverse effect on the relevant business. The publishing industry is also
largely exposed to the threat of content piracy and infringement of intellectual property rights. Furthermore, in
general, the industry is highly regulated by laws and regulations issued and administered by various authorities;
such authorities regulate, among other things, the ownership of media and various authorities have under
consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters,
including technological changes, which could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the editorial, publishing and
media industry business.

The sectors and markets in which the Exor's principal investments operate have already been affected by the
current COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the adoption of lockdown measures taken to limit the spreading of
COVID-19 have caused, and may continue to cause, a decline in demand for the products and services that
Exor’s subsidiaries and associates provide and as a result adversely impact the business and operations of Exor’s
subsidiaries and associates.

Exposure to financial counterparty risk

Exor is exposed to financial institution counterparty risk and will continue to be exposed to the risk of loss if
counterparty financial institutions fail or are otherwise unable to meet their obligations. Financial services
institutions are inter-related as a result of trading, counterparty and other relationships. Exor has exposure to
many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the
financial industry, including financial intermediaries, brokers and dealers, commercial banks and investment banks
for its own account. Defaults by, or even the perceived questioning of the creditworthiness of, one or more
financial services institutions or the financial services industry, generally, has led and may continue to lead to
market-wide liquidity problems and could also lead to losses or defaults. The exact nature of the risks faced by
Exor is difficult to predict and guard against in view of the severity of the global financial crisis and the fact that
many of the related risks to the business are totally, or in part, outside of Exor's control.

Risks associated with the consolidated indebtedness of the Exor Group

The overall amount of the consolidated indebtedness of the Exor Group could have a significant negative impact
on the business and the financial performance of Exor and of the Exor Group. A deterioration in market conditions,
which the companies of the Group were not able to tackle rapidly, could have negative effects on revenues and
cash flows of Group companies; such a situation could result in higher financial charges with a consequent
negative impact on the profitability of such Group companies and as a consequence on the flow of dividends and
other payments to Exor.

The deterioration of the economic and financial position of the Group companies could, also, have negative effects
on the possibility of accessing sources of additional funding for the achievement of the business objectives of Exor
and of the Group companies, for capital expenditure, working capital and the repayment of debt as well as on the
cost of the latter; such circumstances could render the Group more vulnerable. Further, if Exor and the other
companies in the Group should fail to generate the financial resources necessary to repay debt within the terms
agreed, they would be compelled to seek other financial resources or to refinance or renegotiate existing debt on
more onerous terms and conditions, with the consequent limitation of available funds and the increase of the
related costs.

Any difficulty in obtaining financing could have a significant impact on the Group, its business prospects and its
profits. It should be noted that Exor has not given any guarantees regarding the indebtedness of its operating
subsidiaries and associates.

Risks associated with acquisitions and disposals

No assurance can be given that the present investments or those in the future, if completed, will not impact
negatively on Exor’s results and financial position in the short and/or the medium term and on its ratings and will
not encounter obstacles of an administrative, legal, technical, industrial, operational, regulatory or financial policy
nature or other difficulties, such that they may not assure the achievement of the results, objectives or benefits
expected. Exor is also exposed to the risk that the disposal of its investments may be effected on terms and
conditions which are unsatisfactory with consequent negative impacts on its financial position and on its own
prospects.

Exor is a diversified holding company and in the normal course of its business assesses new investment
opportunities as well as opportunities to disinvest, such activity being its core business. In assessing new
investment opportunities, Exor intends to keep its indebtedness at a level consistent with the objective of
maintaining an investment grade rating, that is to say a BBB” or higher. Any delay in completing, or the failure to
complete, an acquisition, disposal, merger, joint venture or similar operation, could prejudice the full achievement
or delay fully achieving, the results and the benefits expected for Exor, and could have significant negative
repercussions on its business prospects and on its results and/or its financial situation.

Risks associated with the investment portfolio and the concentration of investments
Exor is a diversified holding company, with the financial results of its major investments and the capital distributed
by the companies invested (as dividends or otherwise) having a significant impact on its performance.

Since Exor holds a limited number of investments, the economic and financial performance of Exor may be
materially influenced by the negative economic and financial results even of a single investment. In fact, a high
level of concentration in specific regions and sectors can create significant economic risks for the portfolio in the
event of a downturn in those regions or sectors.

Exor’s investment portfolio is monitored and analysed constantly both through the use of corporate governance
rights (e.g. board representation) and through constant dialogue with the management of the companies without
affecting their independence as the managers of the companies.

Exor does not have a specific policy on investment and disposals: investment decisions taken by Exor are
formulated on the basis of in-depth assessments and the expertise developed in specific sectors, as well as on the
basis of the potential contribution of the individual investment to the geographical and sector diversification of the
portfolio and of its capacity to generate future cash flows.

Disposals have been guided by the wish to reduce exposure to non-global businesses or the wish to take
advantage of concrete opportunities to divest in a market which offered an adequate economic result.

80 | BOARD REPORT
The maintenance of long-term investments and the decisions to invest and divest entail business risks, such as
having a concentrated portfolio in one or a few companies or industries, being subject to movements and changes
in market conditions and having to deal with obstacles holding back the disposal of investments. This also means
that, immediately after the disposal of a (or several) significant portfolio investment (or investments), Exor could
temporarily be exposed to few companies or industries, exhibiting low levels of portfolio diversification.

Risks associated with the loss of key management figures

The success of Exor and of the Exor Group has depended, and will continue to depend, partially upon the ability
to attract and retain management personnel and its abilities to manage efficiently Exor and the Exor Group. If the
Exor Group should lose the contribution of key executives, this could have a significant negative effect on the
business prospects as well as on the financial results and/or financial position.

Furthermore, if one or more managers should resign from service with Exor or with Exor’s investee companies
and should it not be possible to adequately replace them in a timely manner with persons of equal skill and
experience, the competitive capacity of such companies could diminish with potentially negative effects on the
business and on the ability to replicate the results achieved in the past.

Risks associated with the presentation of consolidated data in shortened form (Shortened Consolidation)
The Shortened Consolidation data is prepared by Exor on the basis of a “shortened” method of consolidation in
which the data derived from the IFRS financial statements of Exor and of the subsidiaries of the Holdings System:
Exor Nederland N.V. (the Netherlands); Exor S.A. (Luxembourg); Ancom USA Inc. (USA); Exor SN LLC (USA);
Exor Investments Limited (United Kingdom) are included in the financial statements of the parent company Exor
using the line-by-line method, while the data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with
IFRS of the operating subsidiaries and associates (PartnerRe, CNH Industrial, Ferrari, Juventus Football Club,
GEDI, Exor Seeds, Shang Xia, Stellantis, Christian Louboutin, The Economist Group, Welltec and Exor Capital)
are included in the financial statements of the parent company Exor using the equity method.

While the data and information prepared using the shortened consolidation method are recognized by the financial
community, by financial counterparties and by the rating agencies, and Exor believes that these data and
information facilitate analysis of the financial position and results of Exor, such data do not fully represent, nor
should be treated as the consolidated financial position of the Exor Group prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In fact the shortened consolidation method is not
contemplated in the reference accounting standards on the presentation of consolidated financial statements and
may not be consistent with the method adopted by other groups and, therefore, such data may not be comparable
with the data reported by such groups.

The consolidated data prepared in shortened form are not audited by the independent auditors.

Risks and uncertainties associated with the development and interpretation of tax regulations

The economic and financial activities of Exor and of its principal subsidiaries and associates make it subject to a
variety of taxes and duties. Exor and those subsidiaries and associates are, therefore, exposed to the risk that the
level of taxation to which they are subjected may rise in the future. Any such increase in the level of taxation, or
the introduction of new taxes, to which Exor and its principal subsidiaries and associates may be subjected, could
have negative effects on the economic results and financial position of Exor.

Additionally, Exor and its principal investee companies are also exposed to risk from the interpretative complexity
of tax regulations and may from time to time be subjected to inspections by the tax authorities. This complexity
may also have an impact on future acquisition and divestment operations.

BOARD REPORT | 81
RISKS RELATED TO THE COMMON SHARES

Risk related the presence of a majority shareholders

Exor is controlled by a majority shareholder with the ability to sell its shares. This situation could have an adverse
effect on Exor’s stock price. Based on the most recent information available Giovanni Agnelli B.V. holds 52.99% of
the issued capital of Exor, such that its control is not at present contestable.

In addition, this control situation implies that decisions of the majority shareholder could have adverse
consequences for Exor.

The loyalty voting structure could have a negative effect on the liquidity of the common shares, may make
it more difficult for shareholders to acquire a controlling interest, change the management or the strategy
of the Group or exercise influence over it, resulting in a reduction in the market price of the common
shares

The introduction of the Special Voting Structure is intended to reward long-term shareholding and provide an
incentive for a stable shareholder base, giving shareholders the opportunity to decide to receive special voting
shares after a certain uninterrupted period of ownership of common shares.

The provisions of the Articles of Association which establish the Special Voting Structure, allowing qualifying
shareholders to exercise up to 5 or 10 voting rights for each Exor common share held, may make it more difficult
to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Exor and prevent or discourage any initiatives seeking to change
Exor’s management, even if a change of control were considered favourably by shareholders holding the majority
of the Exor common shares.

The Special Voting Structure may prevent or discourage initiatives of shareholders seeking to change the
ownership structure or the strategy of Exor or to exercise their influence and also may prevent or discourage
initiatives of shareholders seeking to bring about changes in the company’s management.

Shareholders who hold a significant quantity of Exor common shares for the uninterrupted periods prescribed in
the Articles of Association and who request special voting shares could be in a position to exercise a significant
quota of voting rights at meetings of shareholders and to have substantial influence over Exor.

The Special Voting Shares cannot be traded and must be transferred to Exor for no consideration (om niet)
immediately prior to cancellation of the common shares from the Exor special register.

The Special Voting Structure could further reduce the liquidity of Exor common shares adversely affecting the
trading price in the market.

It should be recalled, however, that the Special Voting Structure will begin to have its effect only when five years
have passed from the date of adoption of the new Articles of Association following the Merger’s becoming
effective, assuming that the holders of Exor common shares satisfy the conditions for requesting Special Voting
Shares.

No Special Voting Shares had been issued at the December 2016 Merger date, while after the maturity terms
some shareholders registered in the Exor special register have requested to receive Special Voting Shares; at
31 December 2021 there are 124,717,132 Special Voting Shares outstanding, entirely issued to Giovanni Agnelli
B.V.

Risks related to the tax treatment of Special Voting Shares

No statutory, judicial or administrative authority directly discusses how the receipt, ownership, or disposition of
Special Voting Shares should be treated for Italian or Dutch tax purposes and as a result the tax consequences in
the Netherlands are uncertain. The fair market value of the Exor Special Voting Shares, which may be relevant to
the tax consequences, is a factual determination and is not governed by any guidance that directly addresses
such a situation. Considering that the Exor Special Voting Shares are not transferable (other than, in very limited
circumstances, together with the associated Exor common shares) and that a shareholder’s rights to receive
amounts in respect of the Special Voting Shares are extremely limited, Exor believes and intends to take the
position that the fair market value of each Special Voting Share is minimal. However, the relevant tax authorities
could assert that the value of the Special Voting Shares as determined by Exor is incorrect. The tax treatment of
the Special Voting Shares and the consequences of acquiring them, therefore, are not entirely clear and
established.
