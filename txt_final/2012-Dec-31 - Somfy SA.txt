@ | Management Board report
to the Combined General Meeting

of 16 may 2013

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In accordance with legal and regulatory provisions in
force, the Management Board has convened you here
in order to inform you on the management of your
company and its subsidiaries and to submit for your
approval the financial statements for the year ending
31 December 2012.

~+>\|Changes in Group structure

Somfy Activities acquired:

— The distributor BFT Lazio, through its subsidiary BFT
SpA. 60% of the capital was acquired at a price of
€0.7 million. A mutual put/call option was included
in the contract for 2015, in relation to the remaining
40% of the capital. This acquisition generated
goodwill of €0.4 million. This company was fully
consolidated from the date of acquisition (April 2012)
and contributed € 0.6 million to Group sales;

— The distributor TRS Standard, through its subsidiary
BFT SpA. 60% of the capital was acquired at a price
of € 1.4 million. A mutual put/call option was included
in the contract for 2015, in relation to 30% of the
capital. The remaining 10% are subject to a deadlock
resolution clause. This acquisition generated goodwill
of € 1.3 million. This company was fully consolidated
from the date of acquisition (June 2012) and
contributed € 2.8 million to Group sales;

- 100% of the French distributor Mastercom for
€0.7 million through its subsidiary BFT SpA. This
transaction includes an earn-out clause based on
the results of the first two years. This acquisition
generated goodwill of € 0.2 million. This company was
fully consolidated from the date of acquisition (July
2012) and contributed € 1.0 million to Group sales;

— The remaining 10% in BFT Sud-Ouest, through its
subsidiary BFT SpA, for €0.3 million. This company
was already fully consolidated, therefore no change
of control took place;

- 51% (joint control) of the Brazilian company
Neocontrol for BRL 6 million (approximately
€2.5 million) through its subsidiary Somfy Brazil in
August 2012. This company develops, produces and
markets home automation solutions in Brazil. This
transaction includes an earn-out clause payable in
2014 based on results for the 2013 financial year. Also

12

included is a first mutual put/call option exercisable
in 2014 over 10% of capital and a second option for
the remaining 39% exercisable in 2017. This company
is equity-accounted;

— 15% of LianDa for € 1.5 million, thus increasing its
equity holding to 95%. This company was already fully
consolidated, therefore no change of control took
place;

— The remaining 60% of Axis’ capital for € 0.9 million.
This company was previously equity-accounted.
With Somfy assuming control, Axis is now fully
consolidated. This takeover generated goodwill of
€1.2 million. Axis contributed € 0.4 million to Group
sales.

Somfy Activities sold:

— Its subsidiary Klereo. The impact on the operating
result was a decline of € 1.0 million;

— Its subsidiary i-Blind. The impact on the operating
result was a decline of € 0.9 million.

The French companies BFT Marseille, BFT Sud-Ouest,
BFT Languedoc and BFT Autoferm Ouest were merged
into the BFT France entity.

Somfy Participations made an equity investment of
25% in Sofilab 4 for €1.6 million and subscribed to
€0.8 million in convertible bonds. Sofilab 4, whose
flagship brand is La Buvette, is the French market
leader for farming watering equipment. It also operates
in the rump rail and rotational moulding segments.
Due to practical reasons and materiality, this financial
investment is treated as an asset held for disposal.

Somfy Participations acquired shares valued at
€3.0 million in CIAT, thus increasing its equity
investment from 40% to 44.5%. This was the opportunity
to sign a new shareholders’ agreement. These changes
did not call into question the fact that this company is
consolidated using the equity method.

At the beginning of October 2012, Somfy Participations
sold its 65% equity investment in Cotherm. The value
of the transaction was € 11.7 million, i.e. 2.3 times the
initial investment. The impact of this disposal was a
negative € 1.3 million.

Somfy Participations made a 10% equity investment in
the newco Cotherm Evolution for € 1.1 million.

> |Highlights

Somfy Activities wrote down the goodwill of O&O and

Pujol:

-The outlook for O&O, a subsidiary of BFT SpA
that produces lifting gates, rising bollards and
automated sliding doors has deteriorated compared
to the acquisition business plan, due to the macro-
economic situation prevailing in Southern Europe,
where the company conducts most of its business.
The unallocated goodwill was additionally impaired
by € 2.8 million. It has now been fully written down;

— The outlook for short and medium-term profit growth
led to a review of Pujol’s business plan (a company
with a presence in Spain, Portugal and Italy), which has
been seriously affected by the deteriorated macro-
economic environment prevailing in Southern Europe.
The entire unallocated goodwill has been written
down for € 5.7 million. The brand remains valuated at
€ 2.2 million in the consolidated statements.

Somfy Activities wrote down € 0.5 million from the
equity value of its 40% investment in Oxygen (Astélia),
acompany which specialises in alarm systems for the
house-bound elderly. This impairment was recognised
after indications of a loss in value were noted.

The Italian company WAY (Somfy Activities) announced
a restructuring plan that will affect 55 employees. A
€3.0 million provision has been recognised as non-
recurring income/expenses in the 2012 financial
statements.

Somfy SAS was subject to a tax assessment in
relation to the 2009 and 2010 financial years. The main
adjustment was to the transfer price policyimplemented
between a subsidiary of Somfy SA, Somfy SAS and a
number of distribution subsidiaries. The proposed tax
adjustment for these two years totalled € 35.6 million.
The Group considers that the arguments put forward
by the tax authorities are disputable and is confident of
the likelihood that this ruling be overturned. Therefore,
the Group qualified the risk as a contingent liability and
thus no provision was recognised at 31 December 2012
in relation to this dispute.

Somfy Participations wrote down €0.9million of
Sirem’s goodwill. This decision stems from the persisting
difficulties experienced by Sodim, whose results fall
short of business plan projections.

Somfy Participations wrote down € 2.3 million from the
equity value of CIAT. This writedown follows a downward
revision of the business plan of the company due to
difficulties encountered during the financial year.
Somfy Participations wrote down € 7.0 million from the
equity value of Pellenc. This decision stems from results
that fall short of expectations set out in the acquisition
business plan.

Somfy - 2012 Annual Financial Report

Somfy Participations wrote down € 2.5 million from
the equity value of Gaviota. This writedown stems from
results that fall short of expectations.

In order to improve the quality of information, the

presentation of the Somfy Group’s income statement

has evolved since 31 December 2011. The following
change was introduced:

— Addition of EBITA, an aggregate commonly used
within the Somfy Group, which consists of current

Consolidated financial statements

> Sales

Group sales were€ 989.6 million forthe fullfinancialyear
just ended, which was an increase of 3.9% compared
to the previous year (up 2.7% on a like-for-like basis).
Sales were € 513.9 million in the first half of the year (up
0.9% on a like-for-like basis) and € 475.7 million in the
second half (up 4.7% on a like-for-like basis).

Somfy Activities contributed € 889.8 million (up 3.4% on
a like-for-like basis).

Several geographic regions reported substantial year-
end increases driven by buoyant emerging markets.
This was the case in America, Central and Eastern
Europe and Asia Pacific (growth of 12.4%, 9.8% and
7.5%, respectively, on a like-for-like basis). Germany
and France also performed satisfactorily considering

the business environment (growth of 4.8% and 1.5%,
respectively, on a like-for-like basis). Southern and
Northern Europe both enjoyed renewed growth during
the last months of the year but remained negative over
the full year due to the decline recorded at the beginning
of the year, which resulted from the economic crisis and
adverse weather conditions (decline of 0.1% and 3.6%,
respectively, on a like-for-like basis.

~> Sales by customer location

Somfy Participations contributed € 103.1 million (down
2.3% on a like-for-like basis).

The performance of individual companies varied greatly.
Cotherm, which was sold early in October, performed well
(up 6.1% on a like-for-like basis), while Zurfluh-Feller
and Sirem were adversely affected by the economic
climate (decline of 2.9% and 8.4% respectively, on a
like-for-like basis).

The Group's current operating result was € 126.9 million
for the financial year, up 1.8%, representing 12.8% of
sales. This was € 75.4 million in the first half of the year
(down 14.8%) and € 51.4 million in the second half (up
42.3%).

Somfy Activities’ contribution grew 4.0% _ to
€ 122.9 million. The growth reflected a marked recovery
in the second half of the financial year in line with the
rebound in sales, which was partly due to favourable
comparatives and steps implemented to increase
competitiveness (reduction of overheads, increased
productivity, disposal of non-strategic entities, etc.).

Somfy Participations’ contribution declined by 38.0%
to €4.1 million, resulting from the net profit of fully-
consolidated subsidiaries of € 7.6 million (down 25.2%)
less structure costs of €3.5 million (down 1.6%). This
decline was due to the difficulties experienced by Sirem
and the deconsolidation of Cotherm in the last quarter.
Consolidated net profit was €83.5 million, down
48.2%. This largely came from negative non-recurring
items, including: 1/ goodwill impairment of companies
with significant exposure to the markets of Southern
Europe, 2/ the recognition of restructuring costs for
the Italian subsidiary Way srl, 3/ the impacts of the
deconsolidation of Cotherm, i-Blind and Klereo, 4/ the
drop in net financial income due to a high baseline

14

record in 2011), 5/ the negative contribution of equity-
accounted companies due to the writedown of several
equity investments.

~ Financial position

The Group had a net cash surplus of € 36.5 million at
the end of December, compared to net financial debt of
€ 15.7 million twelve months previously.

The net asset value of Somfy Participations was
€ 350.0 million at the end of 2012.

> Valuation of Somfy Participations
portfolio

Methodology

The net asset value at December 2012 is the sum of the
financial assets owned by Somfy Participations.

Financial assets defined as bonds are valued at their
nominal value including accrued interest.

Regarding fully consolidated or equity-accounted
investments and assets available for sale, the
assessment methods chosen are the following:

Securities of unlisted companies

For each investment, the enterprise value is measured

according to standard methods, namely:

— Market Peer Multiples method
Asample of comparable companies, comprising listed
companies in the same industry for which analysts
regularly publish their research and estimates, is
identified for each company valuation. It is stable over
time and is adjusted only if a comparable sample is
no longer relevant. The multiples of the companies in
the sample are calculated by (i) the average market
capitalisation over the last 20 trading days prior to
the assessment and net debt, which is estimated
by analysts at the assessment date and (ii) EBITDA
and EBITA estimates for the current year and the
subsequent two years, derived from the most recent
consensus among analysts at the time of the analysis.
A discount may be applied on certain multiples
to reflect the smaller size of companies in the
sample and the company being valued. The average
multiples of EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortisation) and EBITA (current
operating result excluding amortisation of intangible
assets allocated following acquisitions) of companies
in the sample are applied to the recurring EBITDA and

Somfy - 2012 Annual Financial Report

EBITA of the current year and subsequent two years
of the company being valued. The enterprise value
derived is calculated as the average of the values
obtained by applying these multiples to investment
aggregates.

— Discounted cash flow method (DCF)
This method involves determining the present
value of cash flows that a company will generate
in the future. The cash flow projections, prepared in
association with the management of the company
concerned, include a critical analysis of the business
plan of these companies. The discount rate used is
the weighted average cost of capital and represents
the level of expected return on capital employed
(equity and debt required to finance the activity). It is
calculated using financial data collected for the same
sample as that used for multiples. The cash flow
projections correspond to those used for impairment
testing.

— Choice of method
Where the company being valued is mature in its
market, its enterprise value is calculated by averaging
the market peer multiples valuation and the
discounted cash flow valuation.
For investments where the bulk of future growth
depends on new markets (resulting from a change
of strategy) or which are in decline or recovering, the
enterprise value is calculated using the DCF method.

This multiple criteria analysis notably takes into
account Somfy’s intrinsic knowledge of its equity and its
approach to medium-term investment.

The so-calculated enterprise value is increased or
decreased by non-operating items, assessed at their
net book value or market value if it can be reliably
determined and the net financial debt, to obtain the
recalculated value of 100% of the subsidiary. Financial

15

@ - Management Board report

debt is valued at its nominal value plus accrued interest.
The equity stake value in the net assets is obtained by
applying the percentage of ownership by Somfy at the
date of valuation. A minority discount is applied for
certain subsidiaries with minority shareholding and/or
reduced control.

Securities of listed companies are valued using
the average closing price of the last 20 trading days
preceding the assessment.

New investments, subsidiaries and affiliates, whether
listed or unlisted, are valued at cost during the first
12 months of their acquisition. Post-acquisition, the
subsidiaries establish yearly consolidated financial
statements, certified by the Statutory Auditors, and
update their business plans and profit forecasts for the
fiscal year following the date of acquisition. After this
period, companies are valued as per the above listed
methods.

A voting right that is double that conferred on other
shares is allocated to all fully paid shares that have
been duly registered for at least four years in the name
of the same shareholder at the end of the calendar year
preceding that of each General Meeting.

In the case of a capital increase by the capitalisation of
reserves, profits or issue premiums, registered shares
granted free of charge to a shareholder in exchange for
existing shares, which already benefit from this right,
will be entitled to the same double voting right.

All shares converted into bearer shares or whose
ownership has been transferred shall lose their
entitlement to a double voting right, except in instances
provided for by law.”

@ - Management Board report

This threshold crossing resulted from the transfer
through inheritance of 571,400 Somfy shares previously
owned by Michelangelo Manini to the Archdiocese of
Bologna.

Somfy SA declared, for regularisation purposes, having
crossed the threshold of 5% ownership of its own share
capital on 10 May 2012, following the acquisition of
Somfy shares in the market, and holding 432,934 of
its own shares on that date, representing 5.52% of its
share capital.

Information on the buyback
of own shares (Article L. 225-211
of the Commercial Code)

The company has implemented several successive
share buyback programmes. The most recent buyback
programme was launched in 2012; it was authorised by
the Combined General Meeting of 15 May 2012 and had
the following objectives:

—To stimulate the secondary market or ensure the
liquidity of the Somfy SA share, by way of aninvestment
services provider within a liquidity contract that
complies with the Ethics Charter of AMAFI recognised
by the “Autorité des Marchés Financiers”;

—To retain the shares purchased and subsequently
exchange them or use them within the framework
of potential acquisitions, recognising that shares
acquired to that end may not exceed 5% of the
company’s share capital;

— To ensure the coverage of option plans to purchase
shares and other forms of allocations of shares
granted to employees and/or senior executives of the
Group, in accordance with the terms and conditions
prescribed by law, in particular in relation to employee
profit-sharing, the Group savings scheme or the
allocation of free shares;

-—To cover marketable securities giving right to the
allocation of shares in the company, in accordance
with current regulations;

— To proceed with the possible cancellation of acquired
shares, according to the authorisation granted by
the Combined General Meeting of 15 May 2012 in its
seventh resolution, sitting in extraordinary session.

These transactions may notably be carried out at times
of a takeover bid, in compliance with Article 232-15 of
the AMF General Regulations, if the bid is entirely cash-
based and buyback transactions are carried out as
part of the continued implementation of an on-going
programme and are not liable to make the bid fail.

The maximum purchase price is set at € 250 per share.

Therefore, the maximum amount of the share buyback

programme is € 195,920,000.

During the financial year just ended, on the basis of the

authorisations given by the General Meetings of 2011

18

and 2012, the company bought back 85,153 shares at
an average price of € 156.92, sold 8,602 shares at an
average price of € 158.91 and allocated 25 shares at an
average price of € 85.98 in respect of exercised options.

Out of the 85,153 shares acquired, 8,959 shares were
allocated to the liquidity objective and 76,194 to covering
share purchase option plans and plans to grant free
shares to employees and senior executives of the Group.

Trading fees amounted to € 42,417.09.

No other shares were re-allocated for objectives other
than those initially specified.

The company held 433,109 of its own shares at 31
December 2012, representing 5.53% of the capital. The
value of the purchase price of the share amounted to
€ 173.04 for a nominal value of € 1 each, representing a
total nominal value of € 433,109.

The Management Board will submit a new treasury

share purchase plan for a period of eighteen months

for shareholders’ approval. This plan would replace the
current programme, which will be terminated early.

It would allow management to purchase up to 10% of

the shares of the company, if necessary restated for

any potential capital increase or decrease transactions
that may be carried out over the timeframe of the
programme. The objectives of this programme would be:

—To stimulate the secondary market or ensure the
liquidity of the Somfy SA share, by way of aninvestment
services provider within a liquidity contract that
complies with the Ethics Charter of AMAFI recognised
by the “Autorité des Marchés Financiers”;

—To retain the shares purchased and subsequently
exchange them or use them within the framework
of potential acquisitions, recognising that shares
acquired to that end may not exceed 5% of the
company’s share capital;

— To ensure the coverage of stock option plans and/
or free share allocation plans (or similar) granted to
employees and/or senior executives of the Group, as
well as all other shares allocated under a company
or group savings scheme (or similar), in relation to
employee profit-sharing and/or any other form of
allocation to employees and/or senior executives of
the Group;

-To cover marketable securities giving right to the
allocation of shares in the company, in accordance
with current regulations;

— To proceed with the possible cancellation of acquired
shares according to the authorisation granted by
the Combined General Meeting of 15 May 2012 in its
seventh resolution, sitting in extraordinary session.

These transactions may notably be carried out at times
of a takeover bid, in compliance with AMF General
Regulations and particularly in respect of Article
231-40 of the said regulations if, on the one hand the
bid is entirely cash-based and on the other, buyback
transactions are carried out as part of the continued
implementation of an on-going programme and are not
liable to make the bid fail.

@ - Management Board report

The company reserves the right to use options or derivative instruments, in accordance with applicable regulations.

We propose to set the maximum purchase price at € 250 per share, and consequently the maximum amount of the
share buyback programme at € 195,920,000.

The Management Board would thus be granted the power to do whatever is necessary in that respect.

@ - Management Board report

Due to confidentiality reasons, the level of achievement
of these variable remuneration quantitative criteria is
not disclosed.

The variable remuneration also includes profit sharing,
employee shareholding and contributions to the Group
savings scheme, as described in the Chairman's report
on internal control and corporate governance.

Benefits in kind consist of the use of a company car.

Details of remuneration paid during the year just ended
appear in the summary table (page 24).

The company CMC SARL established a supplementary
pension plan in 2006. This plan applies to Directors and
IIl-C position Senior Executives, as well as Managers
benefiting from an employment contract, in accordance
with the categories defined by the French Convention
Collective Nationale des Ingénieurs et Cadres de la
Meétallurgie.

The plan grants a contingent right to supplementary
pension, pursuant to the so-called “Article 39”, which
is dependent on the seniority of the beneficiary (a
minimum of 15 years). The right to a supplementary
pension is acquired at a rate of 0.75% per year of service
and cannot exceed 15% of the potential beneficiary's
reference salary. The reference salary is defined as the
average of the best three years after applying CNAV
re-evaluation coefficients. Based on estimates setting
at 35% the future rate of replacement provided by the
compulsory pension plans when the affected population
reaches retirement age, this plan should enable the rate
to increase to 35 + 15 = 50% of the reference salary for
beneficiaries whose career within the Group lasted 20
years or more.

Commitments of the plan and corresponding assets
have been outsourced to an insurance company. Future
commitments are fully covered by plan assets under
management, which were measured at fair value.

Management Board members likely to be concerned
by this plan are Wilfrid Le Naour and Jean-Philippe
Demaél.

In relation to their employment contract prior to their
appointment to the Management Board, Wilfrid Le
Naour and Jean-Philippe Demaél also benefit from a
so-called “Article 83” defined contribution pension plan,
applicable to Senior Executives as well as Managers
benefiting from an employment contract, for whom
the portion of contributions payable by the company
represents 6.25% of remuneration, limited to the
tranche B cap applicable to the Senior Executives’
regime.

The exercise of stock options previously granted to
these two directors is included in the special report
presented to the Annual General Meeting, pursuant to
Article L. 225-184 of the Commercial Code.

For members of the Management Board who had
benefited from stock options until then, the new
constraints introduced by the Law of 3 December 2008
have led the Supervisory Board to exclude them from

22

future allocations of performance-based shares and
stock options. However, the Board deemed it necessary
to continue giving perspective to their contribution
and bring their interest as much as possible in line
with those of the shareholders and other managers,
as in the past. Therefore, it was decided to grant them
variable remuneration based on identical performance
conditions to those used for allocating performance-
based shares to Management. No such share was
transferred in that respect during the financial year. It
should be noted that the Chairman of the Management
Board remains excluded from stock option and
performance-based share allocations and is therefore
not concerned by this decision.

The remuneration of Management detailed above is
proposed by the Remuneration Committee. It is revised
each year on the basis of expert advice and is in line with
the Market.

The Remuneration Committee, having considered the
Middlenext recommendations on the remuneration
of Directors of listed companies, submits for approval
to the Supervisory Board the various components
of remuneration and the criteria for allocating the
variable share of Directors’ remuneration, so that their
remuneration may be fixed.

At the General Meeting of 18 May 2011,the shareholders
decided to set attendance fees for the next financial

among its members in proportion to their attendance at
Board meetings and Audit Committee and Remuneration
Committee meetings.

The Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives specific
remuneration for carrying out his duties as Chairman.

~+|Corporate governance

Audit Committee

The Audit Committee currently comprises three
members, Jean-Bernard Guillebert, Committee
Chairman, Victor Despature, and Valérie Pilcer.

The Committee's mission is to monitor the preparation
of financial information and the efficiency of internal
controlandrisk management systems. tis also informed
of due diligence carried out by the Statutory Auditors in
their legal assignment to audit the parent company and
consolidated financial statements, ensures the latters’
independence and is involved in their selection.

The Audit Committee supervises the work of Internal
Audit and approves the annual audit plan. It proposes,
directs and ensures the follow-up of Internal Audit
assignments.

Since its creation, it has met at each half-year and year-
end.

25


--- Page 15 ---

@ - Management Board report

During the 2012 financial year, the Audit Committee met
five times with an attendance rate of 100%.

The Internal Audit Department is under the supervision
of the Audit Committee and reports to the Chairman
of the Management Board, and by delegation to the
Group’s Chief Financial Officer.

This department comprises the Internal Audit Officer
and three auditors and carries out audits that evaluate
the correct application of accounting principles and the
organisation and systems implemented in the audited
entities.

An audit plan is established annually together with
Somfy Group’s management. It is subject to approval
by the Management Board and validation by the Audit
Committee. The assignments included in the audit plan
provide an independent assessment of the efficiency of
the internal control procedures of each entity.

If applicable, the main weaknesses identified in internal
control are communicated and recommendations
are issued. A follow up of the implementation of
recommendations is carried out once a year. A report is
presented to the Management Board and to the Audit
Committee.

In addition, urgent assignments, not included in the
audit plan, may be carried out during the year upon
request from the Management Board or the Audit
Committee.

Twice a year, the Internal Audit Officer presents a
report on the activities of his/her department to the
Management Board and the Audit Committee.

Remuneration Committee

The Remuneration Committee comprises two
members, Victor Despature and Jean-Bernard
Guillebert (independent member), and its mission is
to submit proposals to the Supervisory Board, notably
concerning the amount and methods of calculation
of remuneration of senior executives and to offer an
opinion on attendance fees.

At least once a year, the Committee uses a firm
specialised in senior executive remuneration, which
informs them of the generally applied practices in
companies of comparable size.

The Remuneration Committee met three times during
the financial year ending 31 December 2012. The
members had an attendance rate of 100%.

The work of the Committee and opinions it has given are
the subject of a verbal presentation to the Supervisory
Board to help prepare and substantiate the decisions of
the Board in terms of senior executive remuneration.

Independence of the members of
the Supervisory Board

As provided by the Middlenext framework, the Board
has assessed the independence of its members.

Based on the independence criteria suggested by the

Middlenext framework, the Supervisory Board notes

that, to date, an independent member of the Board

is a member who has no relationship of any nature
whatsoever with Somfy SA or its management, or with

a company consolidated by the Somfy Group, that may

affect his/her freedom of judgment, and who meets the

following criteria:

— He/she is not and has not been an employee and does
not hold and has not held a general management
position within Somfy SA or any other Group company
over the past three years;

—Is not a significant customer, supplier or banker
of Somfy SA or its Group, or for which Somfy SA or
its Group represents a significant share of his/her
business activity;

— Is nota significant shareholder of Somfy SA;

— Isnotcloselyrelated to a Director or major shareholder;

— Has not been a Statutory Auditor of Somfy SA over the
past three years.

In light of these criteria, the Supervisory Board
considered that Valérie Pilcer, Michel Rollier and Jean-
Bernard Guillebert qualify as independent members.

of the Commercial Code)

In order to improve its efficiency and speed up the
implementation of its product innovations, in 2012
Somfy upgraded the structure of its development
teams. The former entities “Shutters and awnings” and
“Windows and blinds” are from now on amalgamated
within a new Activity known as “Home and Building”
structured mainly in project teams. This amalgamation
takes into account the cross-cutting of numerous
products, motors as much as automatic systems and
so aims to strengthen the coherence of offers and
technologies, also by the creation of new synergies
between R&D teams. At the same time, 2012 saw the
launch of a Home Automation centre with 35 engineers
based in Archamps (Haute-Savoie) whose mission is
to further develop Somfy’s Home Automation offering,
particularly the TaHoma web interface, a control point
capable of interconnecting and remotely controlling
all automatized household equipment, including
those of other manufacturers. In 2012, the setting up


--- Page 16 ---

@ - Management Board report

of new technical partnerships with leading players
in the household sector enabled TaHoma’s sphere of
compatibility to be widened. In addition, the home
automation technology io-homecontrol has expanded
into new applications and is now deployed, for example,
on all models of gates and garage doors available on the
market.

In the service industry market, development teams have
been concentrating their facade automation offers on
new digital motorisation systems, controlled by digital
networks as well as on an IP Animeo version aimed
at improving the heating and lighting comfort of the
occupants of these buildings.

As part of its eco-design programme for Somfy
branded products, since 2010 Somfy Activities has
been conducting a study of the environmental impact
of Somfy branded products called Analysis of the
Life Cycle. In 2012, the findings helped identify the
key improvement areas. In addition to the choice of
materials used, reducing the energy consumption of
wireless motors in standby mode is an important lever
in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Based
on this knowledge, Somfy continues to develop its most
representative product ranges in order to make them
more energy efficient. The new generation Oximo motor
uses half as much energy as its previous version. In the
future, eco-design work will continue, centring on three
areas: energy, material and waste.

The Group’s main research and development centre is
located in Cluses (74) as near as possible to the historic
factory that is today in charge of the manufacturing
of new products and includes 400 engineers spread
evenly between the “electromechanical”, “electronic”
and “digital” professions. In 2012 these teams launched
more than 40 new products or solutions and resulting
in the filing of 36 patents. It should also be noted that
more than 100 inventions are on-going.

A policy of sustainable development
integrated into the Somfy Group
strategy

The Somfy Group shares with its employees a culture
of responsibility that underpins its Sustainable
Development policy.

Somfy Group companies exercise their environmental,
social and societal responsibility through the
implementation of Sustainable Development strategies
guided by the following objectives:

—Minimising the environmental impact of all its
activities, sites and products;

— Ensuring the professional and personal development
of allits employees;

— Discharging their civic responsibility by involving
themselves in social issues consistent with their
areas of work;

— Supporting the development of
wherever they are established.

Regarding its customers and users of its products,
Somfy Activities is committed to improving living
environments by helping to deal with environmental
challenges such as the energy efficiency of buildings,
or social issues such as the independence of the elderly
within their own homes.

communities

Several principles help ensure the implementation of

these strategic policies:

— Acontinuous improvement plan measured by certain
indicators;

—The establishment of a structured dialogue with
the stakeholders: customer satisfaction survey,
measuring employee commitment, investor and
shareholder relations policy, active participation both
internationally and locally with working groups and
organisations on industry issues;

— Regular and transparent communication;

-—Compliance with international standards
frameworks (Global Compact in 2013).

Somfy Group’s Sustainable Development policy
addresses the high expectations of its customers
and all its stakeholders, be they the development of
environmentally friendly solutions, or social or societal
commitments. They take into account the increasing
globalisation of the Group's activities, thus emphasising
the need for the predisposition and monitoring of the
respect of ethical principles and governance.

Organisation

Social information

The organisation as a whole and the teams within the
Group contribute to the continuous improvement of the
Sustainable Development policy.

Since 2008, Somfy Activities has had a Sustainable
Development Department. It reports to the Group's
Operations Department. Its missions are to guide
the implementation of the Group’s environmental
commitments, in particular the energy efficiency of
sites, the eco-design of products, the reduction of the
environmental impact of its activities and the recycling
of end-of-life products.

The Group Human Resources Department has the
task of guiding the implementation of Somfy Activities’
commitments relating to social matters.

The Communications Department has the task of
guiding the implementation of Somfy Activities’
commitments relating to societal matters. In this regard,
the Group Communications Director is a member of the
Somfy Foundation Governing Board, the main driving
force of the Group's citizenship policy, and whose main
purpose is to support projects that fight poor housing.

On a quarterly basis, the Strategic Committee
for Sustainable Development brings together the
Sustainable Development Director, the Group Human
Resources Director and the Group Communications
Director. Its mission is to ensure the coherent
implementation of Somfy Activities’ Sustainable
Development policy: Planet, Employees and Company.

Scope

The reporting scope included in the 2012 financial year
is restricted to companies located on French territory.
The companies that fall within the scope of this report
are:
— For Somfy Activities:

+ Somfy SAS

Sales offices which account for less than 5% of

the number of employees have not been taken into

account.

+ Simu SAS
— For Somfy Participations:

+ Zurfllh-Feller

+Sirem
For reasons of accessibility to information for the 2012
financial year, the other Group companies have not been
included. The gathering of information on the relevant
companies that are outside French territory will take
place gradually up to the 2015 financial year.

28

+> AHuman Resources policy
for organisational transformation
and employee commitment

To support the Group in its growth ambition and its
transformation, Human Resources policy is following a
roadmap that is concentrated on three areas and will be
deployed between now and 2015.

Developing skills

The creation of a skills observatory will enable a better
understanding of how Somfy skillsets will evolve, and
what skills requirements will be needed over the next
few years. The aim is to improve staff employability and
to secure career paths.

Developing commitment

The new internal barometer SomfyScope which was
introduced in October 2012 will measure employee
commitment going forward. Action plans will be put into
place from 2013 in order to strengthen this commitment
and to reach levels typically seen in comparable
companies.

Guiding performance

To ensure transparency and fairness to its employees,
Somfy has created and launched a classification of all
positions listed within the organisation internationally.

~ Comment on the scope

The consolidation of information allowing for an overall
vision of social data within the whole of the Group's
scope still remains inaccessible given the absence of a
joint human resources information system.

Aware of this problem, the company decided to invest in
ahuman resources management system to be gradually
rolled out from 2013 onwards. Thus information analysis
will become more and more qualitative as the rollout
widens.

The company will take advantage of the opportunity
afforded by the legislation regarding transparency of its
management data to give detailed information in future
reports on the progress of its social framework.

Given the limited consolidation capacity, the data
submitted temporarily only relates to France by
regrouping firstly data from the companies Somfy SAS
and Simu SAS.

Moreover, information in this social section will include
that relating to the companies Sirem and Zurfluh-
Feller, companies that are over 75% owned by Somfy
Participations and fully consolidated.

Nevertheless, in order to preserve consistency in presentation, the key data of these last two companies will be

analysed separately.

The coverage of this social reporting makes up 30% of the Group's total workforce.

The percentages of males and females by age range
are consistent. Nevertheless it can be noted that the
workforce is more male in % terms in the under 45’s
and more female in the over 45’s. This discrepancy in
the under 45’s can be explained by the recruitment in

Despite a conservative second half-year as regards
recruitment given the less favourable economic
situation, headcount within this structure increased
4.6% resulting in a net hiring of 75 people.

However this growth only affected Somfy SAS, with the
headcount of Simu SAS dipping slightly.

maintained annual increases in salaries despite less
favourable economic conditions in order to continue
supporting employee commitment. Classification areas
for non-managerial positions and the “grading” of
managerial positions are being rolled out in order to
integrate changes in jobs and to assess how attractive

The legal bodies relating to employee representation
(Works Council, Employee Representatives and Health
& Safety Committee (CHCST)) all exist within this
scope and are active with monthly (Works Council and
Employee Representatives) and quarterly (CHSCT)
meetings, supplemented by extraordinary meetings
whenever necessary.

Social dialogue is an important lever that the Group
is seeking to strengthen. In 2012, staff representation
bodies, in particular those of Somfy SAS, all received
social dialogue training with the leading participation of
Jean Kaspar (former national secretary of the CFDT). In
2013, managers themselves will also be gradually trained
in order to help them integrate more widely the important
place of social regulation in the life of the company and to
define their role in coordinating this dialogue.

2012 was marked:

For Somfy SAS by:

— Anew three year profit-sharing agreement;

— Anagreement on profit-sharing bonuses;

— Aunilateral decision on salary reviews.

At the same time, the company undertook a risk
analysis project (strenuous work) and a project aimed
at developing psycho-social risk prevention. These
projects will be finalised in 2013.

For Simu by:

— Asalary agreement;

— Anamendment to the profit-sharing agreement;

— Anagreement on profit-sharing premiums;

— Anagreement concerning professional equality.

The intensity of health and safety training rose sharply for both companies in 2012. A number of work-related
conditions are developing at a rate of almost 1% of the total workforce. Strenuous work action plans and ergonomic
analyses of workstations should in due course lead to the containment then the reduction of this figure.

(*) The supplementary medical checks for Somfy should relate to around 4% of the workforce but in agreement with
the occupational health and safety department, these checks related to 26% of the workforce in 2012, these checks
being intensified for production posts.

The corresponding figure for Simu was 6.2% over the same financial year.

The year was adversely affected in particular by
production issues (urgent transfer of production
between Group sites) which played a part in an increase
in the number of accidents and had a negative impact
on frequency and severity.

Specific prevention initiatives implemented in 2012:

— Supplementary medical checks extended to the
manual workforce;

— Ergonomic analysis of workstations;

— Training in gestures and postures;

— Increase in the presence of a social worker;

— Survey on work-related stress;

— Intervention of ANACT (national agency to improve
working conditions);

- Training in prevention and well-being (considered
movements, warming up, stretching);

— Road safety training for sales representatives and
employees driving long distances;

— Specific training in the use of cutters.

It should be noted that to date no specific agreement
relating to health and safety in the workplace exists
within this scope. Risk analysis shows that we are not at
the threshold of 50% of employees exposed, a threshold
which sets an obligation to negotiate. Nevertheless, the
company will continue in its preventative measures by
continuing its initiatives in this area. Strenuous work
will be included in improvement action plans for the
first time.

The element of work-related stress will be the object ofa
specific action plan in 2013. This element will form part
of the scope of the “living agreement” that the company
hopes to negotiate in 2013.

Finally, the disability element, which is already the
subject of numerous internal initiatives, will also form
part of the subjects on which the company wishes to
establish commitments as part of an agreement to be
negotiated in 2013.

However, whilst the frequency is increasing for Zurfluh-
Feller, the severity appears to be down.

As for Sirem, despite a sharp rise in the number of
accidents, both the frequency and the severity are down,
a sign of the early effects of an active policy undertaken
to bring the company back in line with better rates.

Specific prevention initiatives implemented in 2012:

— Reorganisation of workstations;

— Intervention of ANACT (national agency to improve
working conditions);

— Ergonomic analysis of workstations;

— Agreement signed with CARSAT;

— Chemicals risk analysis;

— Introduction of moulded earplugs;

— Change in certain categories of gloves (cut resistant);

— Installation of a ventilation hood in premises for

No specific agreement relating to health and safety

in the workplace exists in this scope but there are

many preventative measures in place and they will be

pursued in the future in order to further develop the

area of prevention.

Promotion and respect of the ILO core convention
provisions

*Somfy SAS / Simu SAS and Sirem / Zurfliih-Feller
scope

France has ratified the core conventions of the ILO

concerning:

— Forced labour;

— Freedom of association and protection of the right to
organise;

— The right to organise and to bargain collectively;

— Equal pay;

— Abolition of forced labour;

— Discrimination;

-— Minimum age for admission to employment and
concerning the worst forms of child labour.

French law incorporates these fundamental principles.
The companies within its scope respect these principles
within the framework of their management of human
resources and as part of their social relations.

In 2013, the company plans to join the Global Compact
initiative.

Actions taken in support of human rights

In 1945 France signed the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (UDHR) which is recognised as being the
foundation of international law relating to human rights.
The UDHR has inspired a large body of international
treaties which constitutes a legally binding global
framework for the promotion and protection of human
rights.

Over time, international treaties relating to human
rights have increasingly focused on and specialised in
problems to be addressed as well as on social groups
requiring their protection. Human rights legislation
continues to grow and further develop fundamental
rights and freedoms thatareincludedinthe International
Charter of Human Rights, in particular by examining
rights and concerns relating to racial discrimination,
torture, enforced disappearances, disabled people and
the rights of women, children, migrants, minorities and
indigenous peoples.

France was one of the founding members of the UN at
its inception in 1945. As such, it has taken the lead on
a number of issues. It is represented on the principal
bodies of the UN, notably on the Human Rights Council.
Somfy Group governance complies with current
legislation and is part of the long French tradition of
defending human rights.

Environmental information

+ Scope

The reporting scope included in the 2012 financial year
is restricted to companies located on French territory.
The companies that fall within the scope of this report
are:
— For Somfy Activities:

+ Somfy SAS

Sales offices which account for less than 5% of

the number of employees have not been taken into

account.

+ Simu SAS
— For Somfy Participations:

+ Zurfllh-Feller

+Sirem
For reasons of accessibility to information for the 2012
financial year, the other Group companies have not been
included. The gathering of information on the relevant
companies that are outside French territory will take
place gradually up to the 2015 financial year.

~> Nature of activities, associated risks
and measures taken

Somfy Activities

The activities of the sites are tertiary, industrial and
logistical.

The industrial sites mainly perform product assembly
operations from plastic components, metals and
circuit boards sourced from outside the sites. Assembly
operations do not product greenhouse gas emissions,
liquid releases or substances discharges, with the
exception of packing waste and possible manufacturing
scrap which are subject to selective sorting and recovery.
There are no machine operations generating waste
material.

There is no specific noise pollution generated by
the industrial sites affecting local residents. In fact
operations are situated inside the buildings and mainly
consist of the assembly of small parts.

The different sites located within French territory are
subject to classification levels compliant with French
legislation in relation to pollution or nuisance risks that
these facilities are likely to create.

The sites are subjected to an authorisation scheme
for storage in covered warehouses and a registration
scheme for compression facilities and installation of
accumulators for recharging fork-lift trucks.

Somfy Participations

Among Somfy Participations companies, Zurfluh-
Feller is unusual in that it takes in machine operations

Somfy - 2012 Annual Financial Report

treatment.A general assessment of the risks associated
with relevant preventive measures was carried out in
2012. This led to the update of the registrations of the
different stations which are found in registrations or
authorisations for these activities.

Every year Zurfllh-Feller, due to the nature of its
activities, carries out a campaign to measure its noise
emissions that has not shown any evidence of any
particular environmental nuisance.

For Somfy Activities and Somfy Participations, there
are no facilities that correspond to the maximum level,
“Authorisation with encumbrances - (AS)3 commonly
known as ‘SEVESO”.

Conclusions on the natures of activities,
associated risks and measures

For these reasons the risk of air, soil, water and noise
pollution is low or non-existent. This report does not
therefore provide any information on these subjects.

In relation to these risks of pollution or nuisance that
Somfy Activities and Somfy Participations sites are likely
to create and the preventive measures introduced, the
amount of provisions and guarantees for environmental
risks is nil.

Given this low level of environmental risk on these sites,
there are no specific resources deployed. The measures
introduced are managed by the facilities departments
of the sites.

~> General environmental policy

Somfy Activities

The environmental policy of Somfy Activities is
structured around the heading “Planet” which, along
with the headings “Employees” and “Company”, comprise
Somfy Activities’ Sustainable Development strategy.

Somfy Activities has a Sustainable Development
Department. This department integrates the resources
and skills necessary for the completion of projects that
come under the heading “Planet”. It oversees a network
of 35 eco-ambassadors who support, in each sector, the
introduction of measures resulting from the Sustainable
Development policy.

Coordination of the “Planet” heading alongside the
two others (“Employees” and “Company”) takes places
within a Sustainable Development Committee which
brings together the operational Management of each of
these headings.

For Somfy Activities, contribution to ambitions related
to the “Planet” heading has consisted of conducting four
major projects in 2012 on the following topics:

— Collection and recovery of end-of-life products;

— Carbon® test;

— Eco-design;

— Eco-gestures and eco-practices.

37


--- Page 27 ---

@ - Management Board report

In 2012, internal communication measures were taken

in order to raise awareness among Somfy Activities

employees of subjects linked to the protection of the

environment. These measures took the form of articles

in various internal newsletters in video and paper

format (for example, in the internal magazine “Imagine”

circulated in five languages to all Somfy Activities

employees), or of activities at the different Somfy SAS

sites, such as micro-conferences during the Sustainable

Development week in April.

The topics covered were, amongst others:

— Sorting waste on the sites;

— Recycling office paper;

— Energy efficiency of the buildings;

— Eco-design and the assessment of the environmental
impact of products through the PEP ecopassport®
programme.

Somfy Participations

Sirem

In 2012, Sirem continued the rollout of measures
to control its environmental impact, set out in its

> Pollution and waste management

Sustainable Development and environmental control
plan, which was established in 2008. The major area for
improvement in 2012 was the elimination of coil enamel
/ varnish from electric motors that use solvents. This
has been undertaken as part of a general policy on the
reduction of volatile organic compounds.

To back up its actions, Sirem mobilised its employees

through environmental training and awareness

measures:

- Six people attended a training day on European
Directives ROHS and REACH;

— 80 people participated in information meetings led by
training staff and Management on the themes of 5S
and selective waste sorting.

Zurfliih-Feller

Important work identifying environmental risks
linked to industrial activities was completed with the
introduction of preventative measures. Information
campaigns by poster and by working group were
conducted. These campaigns concerned the topics of
waste recovery areas and the handling and storage of
polluting products.

100% of waste water is evacuated to internal treatment facilities or to a public treatment network.

Prevention and recovery of waste

Total tonnage of waste Hazardous waste % of waste recovered
Simu SAS >70%
Sirem > 70%
Somfy SAS >70%
Zurfluh-Feller >70%

Electronic products that fall under the European ROHS Directive were subject to the removal of hazardous
substances, so as to eliminate their impact on products that become waste on reaching the end of their life.

Within Somfy SAS, measures were undertaken in 2012 in order to maximise recycling and waste recovery rates. Thus
all the organic waste from the company restaurant in Cluses is sent to a composting facility. Somfy Participations
have taken measures, particularly those relating to the reduction in production waste through a Quality project
entitled “Customer first !”

The process of winding of electric motors can be undertaken in combination with impregnation operations. This
being the case at Sirem, which has introduced measures to reduce the release of volatile organic compounds by
replacing facilities for degreasing by halogenated solvents with a water/detergent based degreasing machine, and
by eliminating, in 2012, the impregnating varnish for the coils which contains solvents. A new calculation for the
simulated release of volatile organic compounds is planned in order to validate the effectiveness of these measures.

~> Adapting to the consequences
of climate change

Our industrial activities do not present any risks
linked to climate change, whether they relate to the
growing scarcity of water, rising sea levels or the rise in
temperature.

Therefore, no measures related to adapting to climate
change need to be introduced.

No site is located within or bordering a protected area
that requires specific measures.

Nevertheless, Somfy SAS owns several sites in the heart
of the French Alps, near Mont Blanc. Somfy wants to act
to protect the mountain eco-systems and is involved
in local initiatives such as the “Club d’Entreprises pour
la Montagne et son Développement Durable” (CEM2D)
(Club of businesses supporting the mountain and its
sustainable development).

For each component developed by a supplier, Somfy
requests a written undertaking from the supplier
relating to the European Directives REACH and ROHS.

Societal information

~ Economic and social territorial impact
of the company’s activity

Leader in its fields of activity, Somfy Group contributes
to local employment in all the areas where it is located
and thus participates in regional development, while
remaining attentive to the local populations. In 2012,
the Group continued to create employment in France
and notably in the Rhdéne-Alpes region, a territory where
the Group's operations have historically been located.

In order to promote regional development, Somfy has
committed to support the lives of schools and higher
education establishments in the Rhdéne-Alpes region.
In this way, Somfy Group is a founding member of the
Partner Companies Club of the Universities of Savoie
(“Club des Entreprises Partenaires des Universités de
Savoie”). In 2012, Somfy was involved in examination
boards and welcomed some students from this
University on work placements or work-study contracts.

Somfy Group is heavily involved in technology clusters
and competitiveness centres active in the Arve valley
(Haute-Savoie), where the Group's historical sites are
located. Within Thésame, a technology network for
businesses in mechatronics, Somfy is involved in the
development of several technological innovations,
and particularly in new sensors in collaboration with
businesses such as SNR and Tefal.

Lastly, in collaboration and agreement with the regional
authorities, Somfy supports defining projects for the
future of the regions. It is within this framework that
Somfy, in the role of leading economic partner, supported
Annecy’s bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics. In 2012,
Somfy headed a group of businesses involved in a
project supported by the council of the Haute-Savoie
region, which aims to make the region an example of
Environmental and Societal Responsibility.

~ Relationships with people or organisations
interested in the company’s activity

In 2012, Somfy Group maintained a regular and
constructive dialogue with priority stakeholders and in
particular its employees, shareholders, suppliers and
local resident associations.

In 2013, the Group will carry out a comprehensive
mapping of its stakeholders in order to better
understand the challenges and expectations of each
of them, and to determine a form of dialogue tailored
to each category. This mapping will be forwarded to the
Group's senior management.

> Sub-contracting and suppliers
Suppliers and sub-contracting are important for Somfy

due to the nature of its industrial activity which is
essentially assembly.

40

In actual fact, all the components that form part of the
composition of the products are purchased components.

Aware of the challenges related to this, Somfy Activities
has begun to introduce measures to make sure that
its suppliers and sub-contractors are socially and
environmentally responsible.

Thus Somfy Activities has auditors who assess suppliers
prior to their admittance to the panel. These audits are
conducted on the basis of a questionnaire that, in 2012,
was expanded to include questions on the following
topics:

— Existence of an environmental policy;

— Planning to ensure that products conform to
environmental requirements;

- Existence of a health and safety policy and
consideration of ergonomic and safety aspects in the
design of workstations.

These questions are rated, with the ratings forming part

of the final assessment score of the supplier.

If significant variations are discovered, relating for

example to safety in the workplace, Somfy may ask the

supplier to take corrective action.

For every component developed by a supplier, Somfy

requests a written undertaking relating to the European

Directives REACH and ROHS.

As the process is still relatively new, Somfy does not

currently have any consolidated data to communicate.

~> Fair practices

As part of the growing internationalisation of its
activities, Somfy Group is preparing an Ethics Charter
which will set out the Group's policy in regard to tackling
corruption. This Charter will be issued in 2013 and will
apply to all Group employees.

~> Measures promoting consumer health
and safety

Ensuring the safety of the users of its products is a top
priority for Somfy Group. All Somfy Activities products
conform to all electrical standards, in all the countries
where they are distributed. All components used are
tested by suppliers and the assembled products are
fully tested by Somfy.

Through its training centres, Somfy Activities trains
4,000 professional customers in safe installation
practices.

Every product is accompanied by usage and safety
instructions.

+> Acitizen’s policy involving employees

Since its creation in 2004, the main task for the
Fondation Somfy has been to implement Somfy Group's
citizen’s policy. Since 2011, it has refocused on the
area of poor housing, in parallel with Somfy Activities’
strategic mission to improve living environments.


--- Page 30 ---

@ - Management Board report

In 2012, Somfy extended the bylaws of its Fondation for

three years, with a minimum budgetary commitment

of € 300,000 per year. The Fondation Somfy supports

general interest projects developed by the NGO or by

organisations in the following three areas:

-Access to adequate housing and tackling poor
housing;

- Social diversity thanks to
solutions;

— Employability in the building trade.

In 2012, the Fondation Somfy granted funds to 26 new
projects supported by 15 organisations. In addition,

innovative housing

it renewed its partnership agreement with Emmats
France. The support given tothe organisation,amounting
to € 130,000, has contributed to the financing of around
ten projects in France.

Developed in 2012 with the help of Group Human
Resources Management, the “Time for Others” plan
gives Somfy Activities employees the opportunity
during their working time to take part in common values
action days arranged by partner organisations of the
Fondation Somfy. Over the second half of 2012, 51
Somfy employees took part in 13 action days.

>||Information on terms
of payment (Article L. 441-6-1
of the Commercial Code)

At 31 December 2012, as at 31 December 2011, there
are no liabilities due but unpaid to Somfy SA suppliers.

Trade receivables specific to Somfy SAs activity
represent payment terms generally less than forty-five
days from the end of the month.

> Information on risks
(Article L. 225-100
of the Commercial Code)

Somfy Group uses hedging instruments provided by its
usual banking partners to hedge its exposure to interest
rate and foreign exchange risks.

These risks result from:

— Its operational activities: trading (intragroup foreign
currency denominated sales, invoicing of finished
products distributed by trading subsidiaries outside
the Euro zone and foreign currency denominated
purchases);

-lts financing (interest rate hedge on Somfy
Participations’ LBO debts and on medium-term
borrowings entered into to finance Somfy SA's working
capital requirements).

The instruments used are primarily interest rate swaps
and forward currency sales. The amounts hedged only
relate to on-going or future transactions resulting from
Somfy’s normal business.

According to IFRS, all derivative financial instruments
are measured at their fair value. Fair value is either the
market value for listed instruments, or a value provided
by financial institutions in accordance with traditional
criteria (over-the-counter market).

As part of the transposition of the MIF Directive that
came into force on 1 November 2007, Somfy SA and its
French subsidiaries opted for the “individual clients”
category.

Interest rate risk

Somfy Participations’ LBO package liabilities are hedged,
in accordance with contract terms and conditions, by
standard interest rate swaps (swap of variable rates for
fixed rates) hedging against an increase of more than
150 basis points in EURIBOR 3 months, compared to
the available rate. At 31 December 2012, 85.9% of LBO
liabilities were hedged.

42

Each LBO liability is subject to compliance with

covenants set by contract at the time the finance

packages are negotiated.

At 31 December 2012, covenants may be summarised

as follows:

— Covenants were complied with by Zurfluh-Feller;

— Covenants were not complied with by Sirem, as a
result its debt was kept in current financial liabilities.

At 31 December 2012, Somfy SA availed of four to
five-year credit lines totalling €148.6 million from
five banking institutions, of which €10.1 million had
been drawn down at year-end. In that respect, interest
rate hedges were implemented for a nominal non-
amortisable amount of € 5 million.

The granting of facilities was subject to commitments

given by Somfy SA to those banks, namely, that it would

comply with three financial ratios, relating to:

— The Group’ financial position (net debt to equity) and;

— Its coverage ratio (net debt to cash flow and net debt
to EBITDA).

These two types of covenants were complied with at the
31 December 2012 year-end.

The Group applies hedge accounting to interest rate
hedging instruments. Movements in the fair value of the
effective portion are therefore taken to equity, with the
ineffective portion being taken to net financial income/
expenses.

The impact on equity at 31 December 2012 was
€ 0.2 million (€ 0.1 million net of deferred tax).

Ineffective hedgings were a negative € 0.2 million at
31 December 2012, compared to a negative € 0.8 million
at 31 December 2011, resulting in positive impact of
€0.5 million on financial income, as well as a positive
impact of €0.1 million from the disposal of Cotherm on
operational result.

Foreign exchange risk

Somfy’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily
related to intragroup sales of manufactured products
originating from France (these sales being denominated
in local currencies) and purchases denominated in local
currencies.

Over 65% of the Group’s consolidated sales are realised
in the Euro zone.

Derivative financialinstruments are primarily comprised
of forward exchange contracts.

The Group has applied hedge accounting to foreign
currency hedgings since 1July 2010. The effective
portion of fair value movements is therefore taken
to equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in
financial income/loss.


--- Page 32 ---

@ - Management Board report

At31 December 2012,theimpactof effective hedgings on
equity was a positive € 1,162 thousand (€ 742 thousand
net of deferred tax) and a positive € 485 thousand on the
income statement (transferred from equity).

Ineffective hedgings had a positive value of € 6 thousand
at 31 December 2012, compared to a negative
€11thousand at 31 December 2011, resulting in a
positive impact of € 17 thousand on net profit.

Raw material risk

Somfy hedges against the volatility in the price
of raw materials that are significantly used in the
manufacturing of its motors by placing firm orders with
its suppliers, depending on market conditions.

Share risks

The Group is exposed to equity risk on treasury
shares, with their loss in value, due to the fall in
the markets, resulting in the recognition of a tax-
deductible provision of € 19.9 million. The corresponding
€7.2 million deferred tax was posted to reserves.

Legal risks

Somfy Group's operations are not subject to specific
regulations. Its business does not require a specific
legal or regulatory authorisation with the exception of
the compulsory listing on the Register of Companies
and stock exchange regulations.

Somfy Group is involved in a number of disputes in
respect of its business. These should not have any
significant negative impact on the Group's financial
position.

To the Group’s knowledge, there were no exceptional
events or litigation likely to have a significant negative
impact on the Group's or its subsidiaries’ operations,
assets or results.

Insurance — risk coverage

Somfy Group covers the main risks with the following

insurance policies:

— “Property damage”, covering buildings and their
contents (equipment, goods, IT equipment) up to the
maximum amount of damage likely to be incurred;

— “Resulting loss of profit”.

Risks insured by these two policies include, fire,
explosions, lightning, smoke, emissions, steam,

+> |Amendments to
and standardisation
of the bylaws

The following amendments to the bylaws will be
proposed to the General Meeting of 16 May 2013 under
the terms of a special resolution for each amendment:

Amendment to regulations governing
the distribution of voting rights between
usufructuary and bare owner

A proposal will be made to shareholders to amend the
distribution of voting rights between usufructuary and
bare owner at the General Meeting. Article 13 of the
bylaws currently allows for a dual regime according
to whether or not ownership is divided as a result of
a gift with usufruct being retained by the donor in
accordance with the provisions of Article 787 B of the
General Tax Code. In this specific case, the voting rights
for all resolutions belong to the bare owner, except for
those relating to the appropriation of net profit, which
are exercised by the usufructuary. In all other cases,
however, voting rights belong to the usufructuary for
Ordinary General Meetings and to the bare owner for
Extraordinary General Meetings.

It is proposed that the provisions of Article 13 of the
bylaws be amended in this respect with a view to
providing a unique regime for distributing the voting
rights in the event of a division of ownership. So as
not to call into question the use of Article 787 B of the
General Tax Code, it is therefore proposed that in all
cases, unless agreed otherwise, voting rights belong to
the bare owner with the exception of appropriation of
net profit, for which voting rights are exercised by the
usufructuary. Similarly, it is also proposed that the third
paragraph of Article 12 of the bylaws be removed.

Amendment to regulations relating to the vacancy
of a seat on the Management Board

It will also be proposed to the shareholders that the

powers of the Supervisory Board in the event of a

vacancy of a seat on the Management Board be clarified

via Article 15 of the bylaws. In this respect, it is proposed

that a specific provision be made that if a seat on the

Management Board falls vacant, the Supervisory Board

may:

— Either fill the vacancy;

— Or, if it does not wish to fill the vacancy, amend
the previously set number of members of the
Management Board.

Reduction in the length of term of office
of Supervisory Board members

The proposed amendment submitted to the
shareholders’ vote on this point is presented in the
paragraph relating to senior executives.

It will be proposed to the General Meeting of 16 May
2013 that the bylaws be standardised, and more
specifically:

Relating to the conditions according to which the
Special General Meetings must deliberate

It is proposed that the bylaws be brought in line with
the provisions of Article L. 225-99 of the Commercial
Code which defines the conditions of convening and
deliberation relevant to Special General Meetings.

According to these provisions, the Special General
Meetings only validly deliberate if the shareholders
present or represented hold at least, on first notice, a
third and, on second notice, a fifth of the shares with
voting rights and the rights that are intended to be
amended.

The quorum conditions thus required for the first notice
of the Special General Meetings therefore differ from
those required for Extraordinary General Meetings
which can only validly deliberate, upon first notice, if
shareholders present or represented hold at least a
quarter of the shares with voting rights (Article L225-96
of the Commercial Code).

As a result, it is proposed that the second paragraph of
Article 23 of the bylaws “General Meeting” be amended
to remove the reference to applicable regulations
for Extraordinary General Meetings concerning the
conditions of convening and deliberation of Special
General Meetings which are subject to specific
conditions.

Relating to the powers of the Ordinary General Meeting
It is proposed that the bylaws be brought into line with
the provisions of Article L. 225-98 of the Commercial
Code which defines the scope of the Ordinary General
Meetings’ powers.

In effect, the Ordinary General Meetings do not have the
authority to take all decisions which do not amend the
bylaws.

Somfy - 2012 Annual Financial Report

The Ordinary General Meetings are authorised to take
all decisions which do not come under the powers of the
Extraordinary General Meetings or which exceed the
powers of the Management Board or the Supervisory
Board.

It is proposed that the first paragraph of Article 29 of
the bylaws “Ordinary General Meeting” be amended
to specify in this way the scope of the powers of the
Ordinary General Meetings.

Your Management Board asks you to approve the
resolutions submitted to your vote.
