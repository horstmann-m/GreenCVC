CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE

Dear Shareholders,

The progress we achieved in 2020 was clearly positive, even though the year was
marked by Covid-19. This was only made possible by the commitment of the entire
NOVABASE team, to whom | give my thanks.

We successfully wrapped up three strategic M&As, particularly our acquisition of a
100% stake in Celfocus - which allowed us to accelerate our transformation of the
Next-Gen business - and had sound financial performance.

These results bear out the Board of Directors’ strategic focus and prove the
valorisation potential of our assets.

We created the Pandemic Task Force, efficiently addressing the numerous
challenges which arose, and always putting the safety and health of people first.

We updated policies and regulations to improve transparency, oversight
procedures, corporate governance and the creation of sustained value.

We celebrated 20 years on the stock market, and were congratulated by Euronext
Lisbon for our best practices, resilience and ability to reinvent ourselves over this
time. We re-entered the PSI20 and our stock went up 24%, well above this index
and the Eurostoxx Technology index.

CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE

The transformation we have started is now underway, while the path we have
taken gives us confidence. Nevertheless, we still face tremendous challenges
ahead. Winning new clients of size, above all in the European area, together with
attracting and retaining talent in an increasingly more competitive market are just
some examples.

The greatest challenge, however, will be achieving our immense potential. This will
require changes - some profound - from adopting new organizational models to
overhauling mindsets and even our own ecosystem.

This will take courage, a willingness to take risks and great determination. These
ingredients are part of our history and, | believe, will also be part of NOVABASE’s
future!

Luis Salvado

CEO’S MESSAGE

Dear Shareholders,

| am truly proud of the work done by the entire community of the NOVABASE
Group in 2020!

Our 2020 results largely surpassed expectations in a very difficult year. NOVABASE
showed maturity and resilience, coming together as one to face the Covid-19
pandemic.

lam also truly satisfied, at the end of this term of office, for delivering a NOVABASE
which is focused on executing its strategy, is more sustainable and knows exactly
where it is headed.

| would like to have done even more from the standpoint of transformation, but
the pandemic did not facilitate these efforts.

Allow me to highlight several goals achieved in 2020:

Integration of Next-Gen business - After acquiring the stake in Celfocus
held by our partner and customer Vodafone, we integrated the vertical areas
of Telecommunications and Financial Services to create the hub for the
Next-Gen segment;

Robust growth in Turnover - NOVABASE grew 9.9%, with the NextGen segment
up 11%, thereby reaffirming our Next-Gen volume goal for 2023;

Improved Profitability - EBITDA as a percentage was 9.5%, validating our
focus on segments with higher profitability and investments in strategic
initiatives;

Creation of Value for shareholders - NOVABASE share price in 2020
increased 24%, comparing positively against reference indices (PSI20: -6% and
STOXX: 14%);

Management of Covid-19 crisis - We reacted swiftly and earned the trust of
our community, as clearly demonstrated in surveys (98% are confident
in NOVABASE’s leadership in making the right decisions; 83% are very or
extremely trusting).

CEO'S MESSAGE

Since this is the last year of the 2018-2020 term of office, | would also like to share
some remarks about this period.

Today’s NOVABASE is a company transformed compared to what it was in May
2018, when the current Board of Directors’ term of office began. Its strategy is
clear, shared and known by all stakeholders. It completely controls its strategic
assets, and has clear goals set for each one.

Its driver of growth is focused on an expanding market segment, while it grows
organically above the market.

Today’s NOVABASE is a sustainable company. It is a leader in developing talent,
with a sound financial standing and improved risk profile. It cultivates a culture of
equality and diversity.

This term of office has been a time of transformation. The groundwork has been
laid for NOVABASE to assert itself in the Next-Gen segment. There is still much
more to do, but with courage, dedication and talent, NOVABASE will continue to
thrive.

Thank you for your continued support.

Cheers,
Jo&o Nuno Bento

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

NOVABASE has been a publicly-traded company since July 2000. It operates
according to a governance model whose suitability and performance are assessed
regularly by the Board of Directors to help optimize its performance in closer
alignment with the interests of all stakeholders - those interested in NOVABASE’s
corporate activities, namely shareholders, investors, customers, suppliers, other
business partners and employees.

In view of the mounting challenges of internationalization and competition revolving
around NOVABASE’s business, the corporate governance system in place at the
company needed to be brought up to date by simplifying and streamlining company
bodies and procedures, so as to tailor existing solutions to the Company’s size and
specific circumstances.

Therefore, beginning in 2015, NOVABASE adopted a reinforced Latin corporate
governance model comprised of a Board of Directors, Audit Board and Statutory
Auditor (ROC). In this model, a substantially more agile day-to-day management
structure was implemented, with the Board of Directors able to delegate the day-
to-day running of the company to one or more directors (managing directors) or to
an Executive Committee of 3 to 9 members.

Following the General Meeting of Shareholders of 10 May 2018 (which, among
other decisions, elected the members of the corporate boards and Remuneration
Committee for the three-year period of 2018-2020), the elected Board of
Directors delegated NOVABASE’s daily management to an Executive Committee
supervised by the non-executive directors.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

In 2019, the election of Paulo Jorge de Barros Pires Trigo as a new member of
NOVABASE’s Board of Directors, together with his inclusion on NOVABASE’s
Executive Committee, was approved in the General Meeting of Shareholders dated
26 September 2019. This election was proposed under NOVABASE’s updated
strategy for 2019 and beyond (2019+ Strategic Update) and as part of the Company’s
reorganization into two new operating segments (further explained in point 21 of
the Corporate Governance Report, which forms an integral part of this
Consolidated Report and Accounts), given the urgent need to match the structure
of NOVABASE’s managing board to the 2019+ Strategic Update to reflect its focus
on the Next-Gen segment.

Moreover, NOVABASE has a General Meeting board elected for three-year terms of
office, along with a Remuneration Committee appointed by the General Meeting of
Shareholders to establish the remuneration of each corporate board member based
on the duties performed and the company’s financial status. The company also
designates a Secretary and respective surrogate, under the terms of article 446-A
of the Commercial Companies Code, to perform the duties established by law.

NOVABASE constantly analyses the implementation of this model in order to refine

its corporate governance practices, whenever possible, and tailor the model to the
demands and challenges faced by the Company.

FINANCIAL AND
STOCK PERFORMANCE

2019+ STRATEGY

In the wake of in-depth strategic reflection beginning in 2018 on the company’s
future, in 2019 NOVABASE communicated an updated strategy for 2019 and
beyond (2019+ Strategic Update), whose key features are recalled:

* NOVABASE intends to become a “Next-Gen IT Services Company”;
+ Its strategic positioning will be propelled by great Talent and Technology;
+ Bulk of Transformation should occur until 2021;

* Next-Gen as the core segment, being the primary goal to accelerate its growth
(organically and through M&A), by focusing on high-value customers and
markets, in order to double Turnover (versus 2018) with double-digit operating
margins by 2023;

* Value Portfolio segment profitable to fund Next-Gen’s Transformation and
growth;

+ Increase visibility with investors;

* Return of any excess funds to shareholders (expected shareholder remuneration
of 1.5 Euros per share for the 2019-2023 horizon “).

With this strategic direction, NOVABASE intends to increase its investment in the
disruptive technologies of the digital economy, to develop and better leverage the
potential of staff and recent graduates coming out of Portuguese universities, and
to deploy its solutions to more and larger clients in Europe and the Middle East.

NOVABASE entered 2020 in this context, prepared to face the challenges already
known: the growing competition to attract talent and attracting a new client base,
particularly outside of Portugal.

There was no way to predict what would also occur: the outbreak of the Covid-19
pandemic, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which raised the challenge.
However, as history has already shown, NOVABASE has experienced teams in
dealing with situations of enormous adversity and resilience is one of its main
strong points.

Thus, despite the increased challenges, NOVABASE was able to execute key
milestones towards its strategic objectives in 2020, continued to grow in a
profitable way and strengthened its balance sheet, as will be analysed ahead.

The 2020 results allow NOVABASE to reaffirm its long-term vision of delivering
sustainable value to all stakeholders.

FINANCIAL AND STOCK PERFORMANCE

RELEVANT INFORMATION
In 2020, NOVABASE executed three relevant strategic M&A moves:
+ Acquisition of Vodafone Portugal’s equity stake in Celfocus

On April 24, 2020, NOVABASE has entered into a sale and purchase agreement
with Vodafone Portugal, S.A. (“Vodafone”) to buy the shares representing
Vodafone's equity stake in Celfocus, S.A. (45.001%).

The agreed purchase price for Vodafone's entire shareholding was 20 M€, fully
paid on April 30, 2020.

There may be an additional price adjustment of 7.5 M€, to be paid for in services,
which could raise the final purchase price to a maximum of 27.5 M€, as a result
of possible annual adjustments until 2023 related to service hiring guarantees
of 10 M€ per year for three years given by Vodafone.

Due to the importance of this transaction for the execution of the strategy and
given NOVABASE’s financial robustness, the Board of Directors approved the
acquisition, despite the current context of uncertainty. This transaction did not
require any significant guidance reframing regarding the Strategic Update 2019+.

To be noted that in 2019 Celfocus employed over 650 employees and had a 65 M€
Turnover, EBITDA of 6.3 M€ and cash holdings of 16.1 ME. Prior to this transaction,
NOVABASE held a 54.997% stake in Celfocus, S.A..

* Sale of NOVABASE’s equity stake in Collab to the swedish Netadmin
System i Sverige AB

On March 19, 2020, NOVABASE and Netadmin System i Sverige AB entered into
a sale and purchase agreement for all shares representing COLLAB - Solu¢dées
Informaticas de Comunica¢ao e Colaborac¢ao, S.A. share capital, subsidiary held
in 72.45% by NOVABASE Business Solutions, S.A. and in 17.75% by Fundo Capital
Risco NB Capital. The completion of the sale and purchase also occurred on this
date, with the delivery of the shares against payment of part of the price.

The agreed initial purchase price was 6 M€, to which a potential annual
earn-out may be accreted, up to a maximum of three annual periods, depending
on COLLAB’s performance, as set out in the agreement.

Of the agreed initial purchase price, 1.5 M€ was temporarily held by the purchaser,
as foreseen in the sale and purchase agreement. On November, the purchaser paid
1M€ referring to the ‘Holdback Amount’. The agreed purchase price is still subject
to positive or negative price adjustment clauses agreed between the parties.
Additionally, a discussion on the Holdback Amount paid in November is underway.

As a result of this transaction, NOVABASE recorded in 2020 a capital gain
amounting to 0.3 M€, which falls within the range of 0.1 ME to 0.8 ME of estimated
capital gain disclosed, but still subject to adjustments.

To be noted that this subsidiary represented a 6.5 M€ Turnover in 2019 and
employed around 60 employees.

+ Adjustment to consideration on the sale of GTE Business

On May 11, 2020, NOVABASE and VINCI Energies Portugal, S.A. (“purchaser”)
confirmed a net adjustment to the price initially paid by the purchaser for the sale
of the Application and Data Analytics business for the Government, Transport and
Energy sectors (“GTE Business”) and the verification of the earn-out, which was
dependent upon the final performance of the GTE Business in the financial year
of 2019.

It is recalled that NOVABASE entered into a sale and purchase agreement with
VINCI Energies Portugal, S.A. for its GTE Business as at November 4, 2019, and
that the sale was substantially completed at the end of 2019, after verification of
the relevant conditions precedent under the Agreement, with the agreed purchase
price paid on January 9, 2020.

As a result of these events, the consideration obtained by NOVABASE increased
to 39.3 M€, corresponding to the sum of the price initially agreed of 33 M€, the
earn-out of 3 M€ and the net adjustment of the remainder.

Considering the final consideration obtained, the capital gain on the sale of the
GTE Business reached 14.9 ME, so a 2.9 M€ adjustment to the capital gain was
recorded in 2020 (NOVABASE had already recognised a capital gain of 12.0 ME
in 2019). The 2020 accounts also reflect the cash inflow of the total consideration
on the sale, of 35.4 ME.

FINANCIAL AND STOCK PERFORMANCE

2020 was strongly marked by the outbreak of the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic.
The world economy contracted at a substantial rate, following the implementation
of restrictive measures on economic activity and mandatory worldwide lockdowns.
The Companies were forced to adapt overnight to new ways of doing business
and to address the new challenges and risks of the pandemic. Managing uncertainty
took on a whole new meaning.

* Covid-19 impacts

Since its inception, NOVABASE has been monitoring carefully and permanently
all developments related to the pandemic, having created a Contingency
Coordinating Group for the management of this crisis, led by the CFO in alignment
with the Management of each business. A contingency plan based on concrete and
concerted actions was implemented, covering the entire organisation, from the
operational areas to the central structures, with the main priorities being to ensure
safety, health and well-being for all individuals in the NOVABASE community and
to preserve the company’s financial strength.

Agile and efficient decision-making processes allowed NOVABASE to rapidly
adapt processes and action plans in response to the pandemic, with the aim of
mitigating its effects, namely:

+  Allbureaucratic processes were adapted in order to eliminate or minimise travel,
and infrastructures were reinforced, which provided conditions for nearly 10O%
of employees to work remotely, ensuring both safety, health and well-being
for the NOVABASE community and clients business operations continuity.
Our Nearshore Agile Delivery Model proved fit for the new “work from home”
context and our flexible mindset contributed to keep people engaged;

* Still, and so that employees could continue to use NOVABASE'’s facilities safely
whenever necessary to perform their jobs, safety and hygiene measures in
the workplace were reinforced, namely the layouts’ reorganisation in order
to maintain social distancing, the implementation of Covid-specific signage,
namely to circulation, the measurement of employees’ temperature upon
arrival, the distribution of hand sanitiser at its facilities, the provision of personal
protective equipment to employees and regular preventive disinfections to the
facilities, which were awarded with the COVID OUT seal by ISQ;

* Internal medicine appointments were extended to digital channels, new
conditions with the insurance company, within the scope of health insurances
at employee’s choice, were negotiated, with enhanced coverage for Covid-19,
and new benefits were designed to support employees in purchasing office
and wellness equipment to create a comfortable home office. In addition,
and considering the risks associated with remote work which may impact
employee’s mental health, several webinars delivered by experts on emotional
health and performance were held, also counselling sessions with psychologists
and physical and mental well-being activities online were made available;

+ With regards to NOVABASE’s financial sustainability, and as a preventive
measure aimed at ensuring its financial resilience and competitiveness, the
Board of Directors reversed its initial intention of proposing to the 2020 General
Meeting of Shareholders a distribution to the shareholders of 0.85 Euros per
share, postponing such distribution to a more suitable moment.

FINANCIAL AND STOCK PERFORMANCE

In terms of 2020 impacts associated with Covid-19, NOVABASE highlights:

+ Financial - no relevant negative Covid-19 effects were recorded except for a
minor EBITDA effect on the IT Staffing Business abroad (coincident with
localised stringent lockdowns), but overall mitigation in this Business was
possible. NOVABASE recognised incremental costs associated with Covid-19,
namely related to personal protection equipment and additional security
and hygiene measures amounting to approximately 115 thousand Euros.
On the other hand, savings in Travel were made.

+ Strategy - NOVABASE was able to successfully execute key milestones in its
Transformation, as previously mentioned.

* Human Resources - since the beginning of the pandemic and up to
date, the number of confirmed cases within NOVABASE employees is
low, and the last monthly survey (“Pulse Check”) showed that 83% of
respondents are “Very Confident” or “Extremely Confident” on_ their
leadership to make the right decisions on the pandemic, indicators that
reveal confidence that the protection measures adopted were effective.
Covid-19 may also have played a role in decreasing the attrition rate YoY.

+ Accounting - NOVABASE reassessed the risks to which is exposed to and the
key sources of estimated uncertainty, not having identified material changes
triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic (more information on this matter can
be found in the “Quantitative and qualitative information on the impacts of
Covid-19” note included in the Accounts, an integral part of this Consolidated
Report and Accounts).

Looking into the future, NOVABASE does not have reasons to believe that its
strategy will be affected, in fact, the pandemic may even pave the way towards
an acceleration of the digital economy, where NOVABASE will play a relevant role.
Telecom emerges as one of the least affected sectors, and the Digital, Cognitive
and Automation technologies are in high demand. Additionally, NOVABASE
benefits from a very high-quality base of customers, a robust liquidity position and
adequate capital levels, reasons that enables to face the future with confidence.

Nonetheless, a high degree of uncertainty remains in the pandemic context, with
news concerning new and more contagious strains of the virus circulating and
longer and/or stricter lockdowns expected - even with a global vaccine rollout in
place.

Driven by this uncertain context, the Board of Directors decided not to propose
any shareholder remuneration on the 2021 General Meeting of Shareholders,
however reaffirming the commitment to distribute 1.5 Euros per share in the
2019-2023 strategic cycle - which means a remuneration of 0.85 Euros per share
to be paid ahead.

The Board of Directors considers that the liquidity situation and the capital
levels will be sufficient to continue the Group’s activity.

As far as it is possible to anticipate, the M&A initiatives foreseen in the Strategic
Plan are likely to be delayed due to the present market volatility and attracting
new customers should remain challenging under the current travel restrictions,

FINANCIAL AND STOCK PERFORMANCE

which may influence growth prospects in 2021. However, the impact on the results
of NOVABASE’s operations cannot be determined, given the unpredictability
regarding the duration, magnitude and consequences arising from the ongoing
global pandemic.

NOVABASE will continue monitoring the pandemic’s evolution and giving priority
to the implementation of all measures considered adequate to minimise the
negative effects on the Group's operations, in line with the recommendations of
the authorities and on all stakeholders’ best interest.

RISKS
+ FINANCIAL RISKS

NOVABASE’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, namely, Foreign
exchange risk, Interest rate risk (cash flows and fair value), Credit risk, Liquidity risk
and Capital management risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme
focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.

During 2020, considering the Covid-19’s pandemic situation and its impact on
the markets, NOVABASE reassessed the inherent risks, however tried to avoid
excessively procyclical assumptions given very limited availability of reasonable
and supportable forward-looking information on the impact of Covid-19 pandemic.
In its reassessment, NOVABASE concluded that the current financial risk
management policies already incorporate sufficiently conservative scenarios and
therefore are adequate to NOVABASE's profile, not being necessary reformulate
them. However, due to the context of great uncertainty of its global impacts,
NOVABASE continues permanently monitoring the risks, seeking to anticipate
and manage possible impacts not currently contemplated.

More information on each of the financial risks that NOVABASE is exposed to, listed
below, including control mechanisms, assessment of “Covid” and “Brexit” expected
impacts and sensitivity analysis, can be found in the “Financial Risk Management
Policy” note included in the Accounts, an integral part of this Consolidated Report
and Accounts, and for which reading is advised.

(a) Foreign exchange risk

NOVABASE is exposed to foreign exchange risk, mainly arising from U.S. Dollar,
since some subsidiaries perform transactions in this currency, but also arising from
Kwanza and British Pound

The finance department is responsible for monitoring the evolution of exchange
rates of the currencies referred above, seeking to mitigate the impact of their
fluctuations in consolidated results. Whenever expectations of changes in
exchange rates justify it, the Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge
those exposures.

(b) Interest rate risk (cash flows and fair value)

Interest rate risk reflects the possibility of fluctuations in future interest charges in
loans obtained, as a result of changes in market interest rate levels.

The Group’s financial liabilities are indexed to short-term reference interest rates,
revised in periods shorter than one year plus duly negotiated risk spreads. Hence,
changes in interest rates can impact NOVABASE’s results.

NOVABASE’s exposure to interest rates arises from financial assets and liabilities
contracted with a fixed and/or floating rate. In the first case, the Group faces a risk
of fair value variation in these assets or liabilities, since every change in market
rates involves an opportunity cost. In the second case, such change has a direct
impact on interest amount, consequently causing cash variations.

FINANCIAL AND STOCK PERFORMANCE

Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored continuously by the finance department.
The purpose of managing interest rate risk is to reduce the volatility of interest
expenses.

(c) Credit risk

NOVABASE’s credit risk is managed, simultaneously, on a business units level,
for the outstanding amounts of trade and other receivables, and on a Group
basis, for financial instruments. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents,
derivative financial instruments, and credit exposures to customers, including
outstanding receivables and committed transactions. For banks and financial
institutions, only credible and well-rated counterparties are accepted. Credit
risk management of trade and other receivables is based in credit limit ranges,
taking into account the financial position of the customer and past experience.

(d) Liquidity risk

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash or liquid
financial instruments, the availability of financing sources through an adequate
amount of committed credit facilities and the possibility to close out market
positions.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of NOVABASE’s liquidity reserve (which
comprises undrawn committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents)
on the basis of expected cash flows, taking into account the analysis of the
remaining contractual maturity of the financial liabilities and the expected date
of financial assets inflows. Additionally, the maturity concentration of borrowings
and liabilities of NOVABASE are regularly monitored.

(e) Capital management risk

NOVABASE’s objectives when managing capital, which is a broader concept
than the equity disclosed on the face of the consolidated statement of financial
position, are:

(i) To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and hence
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders;

ii) To maintain a solid capital structure to support the development of its business;
(iii) To maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

Management monitors the Return on Capital “ ratio, which measures NOVABASE’s
ability to generate cashflows in relation to the capital invested in its business.

+ EMERGING RISKS

In addition to the financial risks inherent to its activity, NOVABASE is also exposed
to operational and business risks, which can be materialised into threats and
opportunities, and proactively develops adequate mitigation strategies. From
those, we highlight:

(a) Cyber-risks

The growing sophistication and integration of technologies increased the
companies exposure to several cyber-risks (such as large-scale cyber attacks,
violation and destruction of data, etc.), with possible financial, operational and
reputational losses. With the Covid-19 pandemic, and consequent generalisation
of homeworking in society, exposure to this risk increased considerably.

From the point of view of information security, NOVABASE has been reinforcing
risk mitigation measures, accompanied directly by the Chief Information Security
Officer, a responsibility within Executive Committee assigned during 2019, namely
by strengthening technological security controls and, furthermore, focusing on
training on good homeworking practices and cybercrime awareness.

(b) Talent Retention risk

NOVABASE’s ability to successfully implement the strategy outlined depends on
its ability to attract and retain top talent for each position.

The increased demand for high-quality talent, especially in the Portuguese market
where NOVABASE recruits the majority of its employees, may be reflected in a
potential rise in labour costs and the consequent difficulty in retaining talent.
Additionally, the novel coronavirus crisis changed the rules of recruiting and
hiring, as well as forced a new world of work, demanding new solutions and
raising new questions: the remote recruitment, onboarding and training talent
virtually, the resizing of relationships between employee and employer by opening
up possibilities such as remote work, and the ability to attract talent in times of
uncertainty and crisis.

NOVABASE’s human resources policies are aligned with these objectives, having
been adjusted to the new reality. This area was awarded in 2020, for the 24
consecutive year, with the “Innovation in People Management” prize, attributed
by Human Resources Portugal magazine.

(c) Delivery risk

NOVABASE’s policies to address delivery risk include, among others, the following:

+ Analysis of each significant commercial proposal in order to reduce
possible overselling, considering the available internal capacity;

* Permanent scrutiny of the quality of the team to be allocated to the projects;
* Maintenance of permanent training programmes in technologies (namely

in New-Generation information technologies) and project management
methodologies.

FINANCIAL AND STOCK PERFORMANCE

The Nearshore Agile delivery model that NOVABASE refined in recent years has
proven to be resilient in this time of social distancing, which could encourage
more conservative customers to embrace it even faster.

(d) Strategic and contextual risks

NOVABASE is not immune to the contingencies of the markets in which it operates,
still facing the so-called “strategic and contextual risks”. The exposure to this risk
increased significantly on account of the novel coronavirus pandemic, due to its
unprecedented social and economic impacts worldwide and the high level of
uncertainty on the real dimension of the future impacts.

NOVABASE seeks to manage and mitigate this risk through practices of recurring
discussion, at the level of the various management chains, on the risks that
impact on society / business unit. These discussions address areas of investment
/ divestment, strategic bets and pending risks at all times, and where the risk
appetite at the level of the organisation and its evolution is also discussed.

OUTLOOK

In a year characterised by the outbreak of the Covid-19 epidemic, which became
a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and the ensuing unprecedented economic
and social crisis that followed, NOVABASE recorded a robust performance,
presenting solid operating results and a positive evolution in relevant KPIs
of the 2019+ Strategy, strengthened its balance sheet and successfully concluded
strategic M&A operations for its Transformation.

The achievements in terms of operating results and strategy that we report here
bear testament once again to the resilience of NOVABASE’s business model
and financial strength.

These results validate NOVABASE’s strategic direction communicated in July
2019, while demonstrating the growth potential of the Next-Gen segment, being
in line with forecasts on the acceleration of digital transformation in the World,
during and post-pandemic, and with the foreseeable higher demand for Digital
and Cognitive Technologies.

NOVABASE’s Nearshore Agile delivery model continues to show its effectiveness,
having proved fit in this time of social distancing and work from home context,
which indicates that more and more conservative clients will embrace it even
faster, and that even in the post-pandemic the paradigm will remain.

NOVABASE’s bet on larger-sized customers continues to prove to be the right
choice in a scenario of rebounding investment, where these organisations
will be the first to resume investment when the economic recovery takes place.
The Telecommunications sector, where NOVABASE’s biggest customers operate,
has proven to be resilient in the current setting, and is expected to be one
of the first to step up its investments after the crisis.

It is in this climate of confidence, supported by the 2020 solid performance, and
with well-defined strategic priorities and an unwavering focus on creating value
for all stakeholders, that NOVABASE enters in 2021.

Nonetheless, the pandemic crisis continues and will continue to affect the
macroeconomic environment, predictably with greater intensity in the first half of
the year, and the global impacts of Covid-19 are still unclear.

As far as it is possible to anticipate at this date, NOVABASE expects some
delays in the M&A initiatives foreseen in the Strategic Plan and previses still very
challenging conditions on the commercial access to new clients, due to the current
restrictive measures to travel and mandatory lockdowns.

Aware of its leadership role as a digital enabler in the development of a more

productive, socially just and more environmentally conscious society, NOVABASE
is committed and excited with the opportunities for Transformation.

PART | - INFORMATION REGARDING ADOPTED POLICIES

A. INTRODUCTION | NOVABASE GROUP

Under Article 508-G of the Commercial Companies Code, in accordance with the
wording introduced via Decree-Law no. 89/2017 of 28 July, which transposed to
Portuguese rule of law Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of
the Council of 22 October 2014, NOVABASE has outlined in the present document
sufficient information for comprehending the evolution, performance, position
and impact of the group’s activities, at the very least in reference to environmental
and social issues, its employees, gender equality, non-discrimination, respect
for human rights, preventing corruption and attempted bribery in relation to
NOVABASE Group during the financial year ended 31 December 2020.

Information pertaining to NOVABASE Group activity and corporate organization
may be consulted in the Annual Report and Accounts 2020 (Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2020), along
with the Corporate Governance Report for the financial year 2020 (Part |, Section
B., Point 21).

B. BUSINESS MODEL

This information is described in Part |, Letter B., Section Il. “ADMINISTRATION
AND SUPERVISION (Board of Directors, Executive Board of Directors, and General
and Supervisory Board)” of the Corporate Governance Report for the 2020
financial year.

Cc. MAIN RISK FACTORS

NOVABASE Group is subject to regular market risks and the specific underlying
risks of the activities it undertakes. NOVABASE believes that its risk management
policy is absolutely essential to running and developing a business that has
historically been known for its greater appetite for risk, an intrinsic necessity in
such a dynamic and disruptive sector.

NOVABASE also implements procedures and internal control systems used to
prevent and manage risk related to its organization and activities.

Additional information regarding internal control and risk management at

NOVABASE is available in Part |, Letter C., Section Ill. “Internal Control and Risk
Management” in the Corporate Governance Report for the 2020 financial year.

D. IMPLEMENTED POLICIES
i. Environmental

NOVABASE has implemented an Environmental Management System (ISO
14001) that is part of its Integrated Management System (Quality, Environment,
Occupational Health and Safety). The IMS is governed by a policy that is aligned
with the vision and values of NOVABASE, as well as being in tune with its
stakeholders’ needs. Internal and external audits are conducted annually -- the
external conducted by certifier entities. Similar to 2019, no non-conformities were
identified in 2020.

NOVABASE has established a policy through which environmental and safety
requirements pertaining to the acquisition/supply of goods and services are
identified.

NOVABASE monitors a group of indicators: consumption of electricity, thermal
energy, water, diesel and gasoline; recycling of plastic, cardboard, paper, glass;
and greenhouse gas emissions.

Against the backdrop of the pandemic, we highlight the following indicators for
2020:

In addition to the already mentioned measures (e.g. remote meetings, video calls,
existence of offices in other locations), other measures are being analysed to
offset these emissions.

In 2020, NOVABASE joined the reforestation campaign known as Uma Arvore pela
Floresta (A Tree for the Forest) organized by Quercus/CTT. The funds gathered
through the recycling of toners and print cartridges were used to acquire
tree and/or native brush kits for planting in springtime in protected areas or those
areas affected by fire.

ii, Social and Fiscal

NOVABASE has implemented a series of measures aimed at establishing a balance
between its employees’ professional, family and personal life. Among these
measures we highlight the following: osteopathy consultations; acupuncture
and Tui Na; blood pressure and blood sugar monitoring; massage therapy; quick
massage; Health Week and healthy breakfast. However, due to the pandemic,
these measures were suspended and more emphasis was put on mental health
consultations in view of helping everyone who needs such services, always
ensuring the privacy of each individual. Reflective of NOVABASE’s concern for
its employees’ mental health, it created the webinar “What are you feeling?”.

Also in relation to the pandemic, in 2020, 101 refurbished computers were
sold to help remote schooling activities for the children of NOVABASE Group
employees.

NOVABASE also took part in social solidarity initiatives in which we highlight the
following:

* Celfocus
“Student Keep” initiative - below, the bulletin that was released at the time:

“Celfocus is a proud sponsor of Student Keep”

Celfocus looked for ways to minimize the impact of COVID-19 by creating Out
of the Pandemic a community built from scratch by a group of people eager
to help those in need. After weeks of interactions and field research, the community
voted to support remote teaching challenges and partner with a trusted project
that has built a working and multidisciplinary structure.

Student Keep is a project under the #tech4COVID19 movement that works to fight
inequality in access to education by identifying keepers that will donate materials
(computers, tablets, internet, mouse, keyboard) to students without access
to them and by gathering volunteers, who will perform the necessary technical
interventions in such equipment.

How Celfocus helped?

* Rolling up our sleeves

Several colleagues have signed up to support the project in technical interventions
(computer formatting, installations etc.). This help will speed up access to
equipment for those in need.

NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

* Giving unused equipment another life
Simultaneously, colleagues have used the project’s website to register their unused
equipment to be distributed to those in need.

Celfocus will also be supporting Student Keep by funding the purchase of additional
equipment for as many students as possible. Learn more about this project and
be a supporter - https://www.studentkeep.org/”

iii. Employees and Gender Equality and Non-Discrimination

Cabinet Resolution no. 19/2012 of 8 March 2012 determined that it would be
mandatory to adopt an equality plan for all state corporate sector entities, in view
of achieving equal treatment and equal opportunity between men and women,
eliminating discrimination and facilitating reconciliation of personal, family and
professional life.

This obligation was extended to all companies listed on stock exchanges via Law
no. 62/2017 of 1 August, which approves the framework for balanced representation
of men and women in executive and supervisory bodies of the public corporate
sector and companies listed on stock exchanges, Article 7 stipulating the
obligation to draft annual equality plans “that move towards effective equality of
treatment and opportunities between men and women, promoting the elimination
of discrimination on the basis of gender and fostering a reconciliation between
personal, family and professional life”.

As such, on 25 November 2020 NOVABASE delivered a new version of its plan
for gender equality and diversity, in which it defined its measures and practices
to be developed for 2020/2021, among which we highlight those that have
already been implemented:

+ Joined Forum iGen (Forum of Organizations for Equality);

* The book O Longo Caminho Para a Igualdade - Mulheres e Homens No Século.
XX! (The Long Path to Equality - Women and Men in the 21st Century) was given
to all of our employees;

+ Revision of the code of conduct using inclusive language.

The key indicator is the proportion of men and women among the total number
of employees, which should trend toward equality. In 2020 this indicator stood
at 68% men and 32% women, slightly different from the 2019 result in which the
proportion was 69% men and 31% women, which is in line with the information
technologies industry trend in Portugal and abroad, and reflects the predilection
for university courses in these areas for each gender.

At NOVABASE we believe in equal opportunity and mutual respect, regardless

of ethnicity, gender, religion, ideology, social background or sexual orientation.
These differences tend to improve the quality of the decision-making processes
through a multiplicity of perspectives, greater intellectual and cultural richness
and greater representation of realty and the stakeholders.

This is why we also believe that the diversity of our governing bodies contributes
to better performance and greater competitiveness on the part of NOVABASE.
Thus, we are committed to promoting the following policy:

* Compliance with Law no. 62/2017 of 1 August, since gender diversity leads to
different management styles and complementary approaches;

+ With regard to age, there must be a balance between experience and maturity
on the one hand, and youth and energy on the other hand, the latter being so
essential to the fast-paced innovation of our highly dynamic sector (information
technologies);

* Regarding qualifications and education, in addition to areas associated with
technology, various other areas of knowledge must also be represented, in view
of the mounting importance of multidisciplinarity in team performance.

NOVABASE will monitor this policy’s implementation, in accordance with its
corporate governance model, and will review it whenever deemed appropriate.

iv. Human Rights

NOVABASE ensures and implements own principles specifically related to (i)
respect for human rights (ii) collective bargaining and (iii) ensuring the absence
of child labour or forced/obligatory labour. It has a Code of Conduct that lays out
these principles, which was revised and approved by the Board of Directors over the
course of 2020. The Code establishes the principles and rules that govern relations
between NOVABASE and its stakeholders in their broadest form. They represent
a commitment to NOVABASE clients and partners, but also a commitment by
employees and to employees with respect to the manner in which they relate to the
company and to each other. It covers topics that include integrity, transparency,
respect, safety and health, information use, intellectual property, use of resources,
social and environmental responsibility, not to mention management of conflicts
of interest, corruption and bribery, in addition to including several aspects such
as legal compliance, good environmental and labour practices and human rights,
and application of these principles when hiring third parties. The Code of Conduct
is available in the institutional area of the website and via intranet. Our ethical
concerns extend to our suppliers and partners. The principles and rules described
in the NOVABASE Code of Conduct must be strictly adhered to by each partner
or supplier who works with NOVABASE and must be incorporated into their daily
processes. NOVABASE includes in its contracts with suppliers a commitment to
adhering to the NOVABASE Code of Conduct.

v. Fight against Corruption and Bribery Attempts

Nevertheless, NOVABASE Group is governed in the various areas of its activity by
applicable legislation and regulations, and relevant recommendations from the
Portuguese Securities Market Commission and other national and international
