1.2. Megatrends in our environment are creating opportunities

Urbanization, industrialization and digitization continue to shape
our lives as new economies are built and established economies
are rebuilt and transformed. These three megatrends will create
many new opportunities for Schneider Electric.

Urbanization

Cities today contain 50% of the world’s population, consume 75%
of global energy consumption and give off 80% of greenhouse gas
emissions. And cities are growing: by 2050, they will be home to
70% of the world’s population. Cities face urban challenges of
unprecedented scale: scarcity of resources such as energy and
water, environmental pressure and pollution, aging and overloaded
infrastructure, traffic congestion; and security concerns.

2014 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 4$)/& *% &&-&$53*$

All over the world, cities need to become smarter: more efficient,
more liveable and more sustainable. This means:

z improving the efficiency of the city’s underlying urban
infrastructures from electricity grid, to water distribution system,
to public transportation systems, services... and exchange of
data and information across departments;

z becoming a better place to live, work and play;

z reducing its environmental impact - lower carbon footprint,
reduce energy consumption and urban regeneration

So what cities need today are solutions to their most acute
pain-points that: deliver the services and savings that constituents
deserve; provide visible, measurable results that promote
attractiveness; and have a low upfront investment, because cities
across the world need to balance their budget.
OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP’S STRATEGY, MARKETS AND BUSINESSES

Schneider Electric delivers urban efficiency as a trusted partner
to drive collaboration and buy-in of all stakeholders - local and
regional governments, private companies, utilities, real estate
developers, and investors. We provide comprehensive solutions by
bringing in proven technology, integrating operating and
information systems, and enabling connected, unified approach to
decision-making. Schneider Electric already works with more than
250 cities across the world, and helps provide visible benefits to
cities and their constituents:

z up to 30% energy savings;

z up to 15% reduction of water losses;

z up to 20% reduction of travel time and traffic delays;

z as well as environmental, social and economic benefits.

Industrialization

Industrialization is driven by increase of factories in New
Economies, on higher demand for goods, and _ efficiency
improvement as well as retrofit in Mature Countries.

Manufacturing activities rise as New Economies develop. In 2014,
new economies represented 38% of world GDP — and this should
reach close to 54% by 2030. Significant step-up in industrialization
will follow. Population growth in New Economies will also drive
increased needs for manufactured goods with 1.8 billion people
entering the global consuming class by 2025.

At the same time energy needs will increase accordingly. The share
of global energy demand of non-OECD will continue to rise — from
60% in 2014 to close to 66% by 2030 - because of
demographics,  industrialization, urbanization, and growing
affluence. Capex in new economies will also increase accordingly,
from 52% of world Capex in 2014 to close to 61% by 2030.

In addition to the growing industrialization of emerging market,
there is a movement of industrialization development in some
mature economies such as the United States. In particular, the
shale gas development leads to strong investments in the chemical
and petrochemical industries. At the same time the drop in energy
price and the decrease in labor prices have resulted in re-location
of some manufacturing plants. In many Mature Countries, as most
companies are looking for efficiency and facility upgrades, services
and other attributes in manufacturing (F Hinnovation, time to
market, loT) are also becoming more important and driving
additional growth potential.

The growing trend of industrialization promises business growth
and expansion opportunities for Schneider Electric. For long term
sustainable development in New Economies, Schneider Electric will
continue to focus on combining its global value chain with local
partnerships to contribute toward the economic development
through job creation and poverty reduction, in addition to
investments in production capacity and physical & technological

SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC STRATEGY AND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

infrastructure to meet the growing demands for standardized and
cost efficient offerings. In Mature Countries, Schneider Electric will
continue its focus on solution and identify opportunities for further
services development, to contribute toward the reindustrialization/
efficiency improvements in these markets.

Digitization

In the past 20 years, Internet has connected 2.5 billion people
together. In the coming eight years, this number will double.
Concurrently the Internet will connect 40 billion machines to those
5 billion connected people. The increase in connectivity and
access of real-time information is changing our personal and
professional life: companies are digitizing their operations, often
imes through SaaS providers; customers are expecting to have
everything online, from e-training to e-ordering and digital care
centers; and employees are increasingly using online platforms and
cools to collaborate more efficiently across countries and time
zones. Digitization is changing the way we work and creating
opportunities for new services.

n energy management, operational technology (OT), the world of
physical equipment control, is converging with information
echnology (IT), the world of information processing. Products are
now connected and can be remotely controlled and optimized.
This results in the feasibility to implement active energy efficiency,
which creates new business models and new opportunities in
smart products, systems and services — such as smart grid and
smart factories.

A smarter grid combines smarter supply (the efficient integration of
renewable energy sources, flexible distribution), smarter demand
(energy-efficient sites and homes, connected to the grid), and
demand response to balance the two. Schneider Electric is active
in five key domains of the smart grid: flexible distribution,
renewable energy integration, efficient buildings, electric vehicle
charging infrastructure and demand-response. Recent acquisitions
have considerably strengthened our play - from Areva’s
Distribution business to Energy Pool and Vizelia in 2010 and
Summit Energy and Telvent in 2011.

In smart factories, all manufacturing units including assembly lines
and robotics are connected and automated with minimum human
inputs. Through real-time data collection and analysis, production
process can be automatically diagnosed, configured and
optimized. Consequently product defects, production downtime
and waste can be reduced, resulting in higher manufacturing
efficiency. Together with OT sensors and control devices, industrial
software is the core of smart factories. With the acquisition of
Invensys, Schneider Electric has_ significantly strengthened its
industrial software offering, especially in operations management,
for process management as well as_ industrial automation
applications.

OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP’S STRATEGY, MARKETS AND BUSINESSES
SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC STRATEGY AND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Besides continuously innovating and digitizing our offerings,
Schneider Electric targets to provide the best-in-class digital
experience to our customers and partners, such as a 24x7
dynamic sales & marketing channel and a tailored customer care
center experience. Digitization is at the core of the Group’s
strategy and Schneider Electric is committed to support the digital
transformation of its customers and its partners.

Urbanization, industrialization and digitization create many new
opportunities for Schneider Electric, from the growing needs of

1.3 Our strategy

As a leader in energy management and automation, Schneider
Electric is at the forefront to capture these megatrends with an
extensive energy management and automation offer that it delivers
globally through complementary business models and access
channels.

Leverage the world’s new energy challenges

The quest for economic growth and development is straining our
planet’s resources and the world is facing many energy challenges:
scarcity of natural resources, CO, emissions reduction
requirements, integration of unpredictable and_ intermittent
renewable sources of energy, increases in peaks of consumption
and others. In its World Energy Outlook, the International Energy
Agency (IEA) estimates that the various energy efficiency policies
that are being introduced in many countries across the world could
account for about 70% of the reduction in projected global
energy demand in 2035, and 68% of the cumulative global savings
in CO, emissions. This compares with a 46% increase in global
energy demand by 2035 if nothing changes.

Boosting Energy Efficiency on the three major energy-consuming
sectors (industry, buildings and homes) could help a country
reduce its overall energy use by 15% to 25% — in effect providing
a very attractive business case in both mature and new
economies. Energy Efficiency also offers an excellent payback:
according to the IEA, every euro invested, in particular in buildings,
would yield 1.6 euro in energy savings. Schneider Electric has
developed a wide range of products and solutions that will provide
homeowners and managers of industrial plants, data centers,
infrastructure and buildings with significant levels of energy
efficiency and savings.

Our building automation solutions can save up to 30% of a
building’s energy needs, significantly improving a company’s
carbon footprint while delivering savings on its charges, with limited
upfront investment.

Our smart grid solutions help electricity producers and distributors
to improve the efficiency of their assets and to offer a better service
to their consumers. This also contributes to the improvement in the
operation of the grid and the reduction in investment in new
generation capacity.

2014 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 4$)/& *% &&-&$53*$

Serve the increasing need for automation of our
customers in key market segments

The rapid industrialization taking place in new economies and the
need to modernize existing industrial facilities in mature economies
create significant opportunities for growth. Coupled with this, large
corporations are looking to improve operational efficiency across
the whole enterprise, while at the same time improving security

well-placed to address these challenges. We leverage extensive
software capabilities to help customers in key industries such as
mining, oil & gas, food-processing or cement plants improve their
productivity and operational efficiency, reduce their energy
consumption and optimize their use of resources.

Schneider Electric also helps machine manufacturers in markets
such as material handling or packaging develop reliable, fast,
precise and efficient machines. Our application design engineers
optimise the machine's performance and reduce the length of the
design cycle shortening the machine builder's time-to-market.

Support the digital transformation of customers
and partners

The convergence of operational technology (OT) and information
technology (IT) creates many new opportunities for customers. It
makes their life easier, increases productivity, creates new
business models that provides new value propositions for their
own customers. Digitization is at the heart of their future growth.
Through continuous innovation, Schneider Electric engineers
products and solutions that help them unlock this potential.
OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP’S STRATEGY, MARKETS AND BUSINESSES

Schneider Electric builds native connectivity in its product offerings,

purchasing and manufacturing costs accounted for approximately
53% of our industrial costs.

Schneider Electric currently holds significant presence in new
economies in Asia, Africa, Middle East, Latin America, Eastern
Europe and Russia (now the 4'" market in Schneider Electric). The
decision to split our Executive Committee into three management
hubs, a pioneer management decision, allows us to be close to its
customers in all markets — remaining local while being global. Our
long-term commitment helps us build an intimate knowledge of
these markets and we believe that the strength of our brands, our
competitive local supply chain and the development of local
marketing and R&D capabilities are our competitive advantages in
these economies.

Build two complementary business models:
Products, and Solutions

Products and, solutions are different and complementary business
models and we aim to deliver profitable growth in both.

SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC STRATEGY AND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

We believe in the high long-term growth potential of our business
and we continuously invest to drive that growth. This investment is
focused on sustained spending in research and development, as
well as on growing our commercial presence and skills, especially
in the fields of high value-added technologies and services.

In addition to our commitment to organic growth, we have invested
in, companies, joint ventures, strategic alliances and mergers that
reinforced our global leadership, provided skills geared towards
energy management and automation, or related to local
businesses in new economies. Certain of our recent acquisitions
have been of significant size and scope, such as our purchase of
Invensys in 2014, Telvent in 2011 or Areva D in 2010, while other
acquisition targets have been more modest.

In addition to the investments we make to foster growth, driving
efficiency at all levels of our Company is an equally important focus

2.2 Serving four attractive end markets

Schneider Electric serves customers in four principal markets:
z Non-residential & residential Buildings;

z Utilities and Infrastructures;

z Industries and Machine manufacturers;

z Data Centers and Networks.

Non-residential and residential buildings

The non-residential buildings market includes public, commercial
and industrial buildings such as offices, hotels, hospitals, shopping
centers, schools, sports and cultural centers. Because this sector
is energy intensive, energy efficiency is key and is subject to new
and demanding regulations. Specific requirements have to be met
in terms of occupant comfort, security and environmental
friendliness, as do the needs of owners and building managers
seeking to reduce investment costs and optimize maintenance and
operating costs. Schneider Electric’s non-residential customers
include end-users, property developers, design firms, systems
integrators, panel builders and _ installers, electrical equipment
distributors and building management companies.

In the context of single-family homes and apartment buildings,
Schneider Electric's market is driven both by renovation and
refurbishment needs, particularly in mature economies, as well as
by construction, particularly in new economies. Whether for
renovation or construction, the underlying challenge is to reconcile
technical constraints, local standards and regulations with
consumer preferences. They not only desire comfort and
aesthetics, but increasingly energy efficiency, connectivity, security
and monitoring services as well. Residential customers include
mainly electricians, architects and decorators, those involved in the
home automation industry, lighting and security firms, construction
firms, contractors, electrical equipment distributors and large
do-it-yourself (« DIY ») stores, as well as end-users and home
owners.

Utilities and infrastructures

Current global challenges in the utilities and infrastructure market
include increasing energy demand, the need for increased energy
efficiency to reduce environmental impact, and the expansion of
renewable energy. This market also faces the evolution of

2014 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 4$)/& *% &&-&$53*$

regulations, particularly those regarding demand response, and the
growing need for security, reliability, and real-time control. We
believe these challenges provide long-term growth prospects. Our
main customers in this market include energy operators, water
utilities, the owners and operators of transportation and oil & gas
infrastructure and municipalities.

Industries and machine manufacturers

Our energy solutions enable us to serve almost all segments of the
industries and machine manufacturers market, including mines,
cement plants, the food-processing industry and material handling
and packaging machines. With Invensys, we reinforce our
presence in the Refining, Petrochemical and Oil & Gas Industries.
Energy efficiency is at the heart of the challenges facing these
industries, which include the reduction of production costs,
compliance with new regulations, and the reduction of the
environmental impact of industrial activity. In addition, both the
rapid industrialization taking place in new economies and the need
to modernize existing industrial facilities in mature economies
create significant opportunities for growth. Our customers include

end users, engineering firms, systems integrators, OEMs,
electro-intensive industries, panel builders and _ electrical
distributors.

Data centers and networks

Data centers are secure, precision-cooled sites containing
Information Technology (IT) equipment that processes and
stores very large quantities of digital data. These sites constitute
the central nervous systems of businesses and the public sector.
The expansion of data centers requires a significant increase in
electricity to accommodate the IT equipment’s operation and
cooling, as the energy needed to cool these rooms has become
comparable to the energy needed to operate the equipment itself.

Schneider Electric believes that data centers and networks are a
high-potential market thanks to the growing digitalization of
professional and personal activities. With the development of web
giants and cloud computing, the physical infrastructure of
datacenters tends to be more and more the business of dedicated
players with high performance expectations.

COMPANY HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT

> 4. Company history and

development

4.1 History

From its beginnings in steel during the Industrial Revolution over
175 years ago, to electricity and, more recently, to energy
management, the Group has undertaken significant changes in its
operations throughout its history.

1836-1980: a Family Business becomes
a Major Player

1836: Brothers Adolphe and Joseph-Eugene Schneider take over
an abandoned foundry in Le Creusot, France and, two years later,
create Schneider & Cie, focusing primarily on the steel industry.
Schneider & Cie grows rapidly, specializing in the production of
heavy machinery and transportation equipment, and eventually
becomes the Schneider Group, a diversified conglomerate.

1975: the Schneider Group acquires an interest in Merlin Gerin,
one of the top manufacturers of electrical distribution equipment in
France that has been involved in the electricity sector since 1920.

1981-2001: the Schneider Group refocuses
on the Electricity Sector

1981-1997: Schneider Group refocuses on the electrical industry
by divesting its non-strategic assets, such as its public works

company, Spie Batignolles. Schneider Group undertakes a series
of strategic acquisitions: Telemecanique in 1988, Square D in 1991
and Merlin Gerin in 1992.

1999: Schneider Group acquires Lexel, one of Europe’s largest
suppliers of installation systems and control solutions. In May 1999
the Group is renamed to Schneider Electric, to clearly emphasize
its expertise in the electrical field.

Since 2002: a Strategic Transformation

At the turn of the 2000s, Schneider Electric radically rethinks its
growth strategy, setting itself three goals:

N

ensuring a more balanced exposure to its strategic end markets;

enhancing its portfolio of historical operations (electricity
distribution, automation and industrial control) with adjacent and
synergetic businesses in order to boost its organic growth
potential; and

N

N

anticipating the future energy requirements of companies and
individuals.

This strategy led Schneider Electric to conduct a number of
strategic acquisitions both in mature countries and in new
economies targeting companies offering complementary products
and solutions.

4.2 From Power & Control to Energy Management

Reinforcing leadership in Low Voltage
Distribution

N

We were a long time leader through our Merlin Gerin and Square
D brands.

We reinforced our Wiring Devices and Ultra Terminal offer with
several acquisitions: Clipsal in 2003, OVA, Merten and GET
in 2006, Marisio and Wessen in 2008.

We grew our portfolio in renewables conversion with Xantrex
in 2008.

We grew our presence in new economies with Delixi in China,
Conzerv in India (2009) and Steck group in Brazil (2011).

N

N

N

Building a global leader in Medium
Voltage & Grid Automation

N

We have historically been one of the leading players in medium
voltage electrical distribution products and equipment.

N

With the acquisition of ArevaD (Areva’s medium voltage
distribution division) in June 2010, we became worl leader in
medium voltage and grid automation.

N

In 2010, we acquired 50% of Electroshield Samara, a leading
medium voltage company in Russia. In 2013, we acquired full
ownership of this company, transforming Russia into a key
market for the Group and enhancing our capacity to be a key
player in the oil, gas and mining industry, as well as to develop
energy efficiency and smart grid.

5.1 Leverage technology advances

Emerging trends that appeared in the last five years, like Internet of
things («loT »), digitization and IT/OT convergence, are now
shaping Schneider Electric’s R&D strategy and investments. They
are impacting the way products and systems are architected,
developed, delivered and serviced, with significant value for our
customers.

Digitization and loT

Beyond personal devices, loT is a huge opportunity in industrial
systems. It enables significant increase in the number of measure
and control points and, as a consequence, further optimization of
hese systems. Since 2000, Schneider Electric has invested in
research programs to develop low power « pervasive sensing »
devices which are now reaching industrialization phase, just in time
‘0 contribute to such solutions.

Sensors that can work 10 years off a button size battery while
ransmitting data over wireless « mesh » networks are reaching
industrialization. Their lifetime cost is up to 10 times lower than
classical wired sensors and will revolutionize the way buildings and
actories are monitored and controlled.

R&D efforts now focus on the ease of deploying and running large
networks of such sensors and the scalability and security of the
infrastructure needed to harness the data coming from these
networks. The cloud based Digital Services Platform was
developed by Schneider Electric over the last three years to
address these two challenges. Dozens of pilots are underway with
business units and external partners, leveraging a library of
analytics modules developed in the context of the Operational
Intelligence program.

Using mobile technology, the insights delivered by these analytics
are packaged into simple, yet powerful, «context aware »
applications. Thanks to geo-localization, the information can
literally find its way to the person needing it most, depending on
where he/she is. Once advised, another set of mobile based
applications, including augmented reality, further guide the user to
transform these insights into action.

2014 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 4$)/& *% &&-&$53*$

IT/OT convergence

StruxureWare, Schneider Electric’s flagship R&D program was
already about bridging the gap between automation systems (OT)
and enterprise level applications like ERP (IT) to allow further
optimization of operations. With the acquisitions of such
companies as 7T in Water, Solve IT in mining and lately InStep in
Utilities, Schneider Electric has built a strong portfolio of solutions
hat bridge this gap and deliver strong operational improvements.

n addition to delivering solid results, IT/OT convergence opens up
he possibility for simpler, more scalable and flexible industrial
architectures, leveraging the best of IT technologies, like cloud
computing and virtualization, and the OT advances driven by loT.
n partnership with major IT players, like CISCO and Microsoft, as
well as thought leading customers, Schneider Electric is designing
he future converged industrial architectures that have the potential
of dividing by two the lifetime cost of ownership of industrial control
systems.

2

Modeling and simulation

Regarding lifetime cost, the design phase of industrial projects
plays a critical role in reducing both time and cost of system
deployment.

Invensys, acquired by Schneider Electric in January 2014, is a
leader in the simulation of complex continuous processes, such as
refineries or chemical plants. During the design phase, the plant
can be simulated to optimize its design, validate its performance
and start operator training before it is even built. The IT division had
developed a similar set of tools for data centers, including 3D
thermal simulations to validate the design of the cooling system.

R&D teams are working to generalize this offering to any kind of
industrial system, including large and complex buildings like
hospitals, in partnership with the leading CAD/CAE suppliers in
these domains. Filling the gap between design and operational
systems will not only decrease design-and-build costs but also
those linked to maintaining and evolving systems over the 30+ life
expectancy that is common in some industries.

Within five years, one can expect that industrial systems will be
developed like modern software, starting from a model of the
process, followed by a simulation based on this model, developed
and tested « against » the model and finally deployed on totally
standardized hardware.
OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP’S STRATEGY, MARKETS AND BUSINESSES

5.2 Deliver truly innovative solutions

The advances mentioned above generate innovation across
market segments, all the way from homes to smart cities, as
illustrated in these few examples.

Homes

The Wiser home control solution includes a battery powered
wireless thermostat that can be easily installed to optimize the
comfort and energy consumption of each room. The new version
of this thermostat, leveraging the loT platform developed in the last
three years has a five times longer battery life (up to 10 years),
costs 50% less and is three times thinner than a traditional wired
thermostat.

Buildings

Making buildings more efficient often requires significant upgrades
of their control systems, which often leads to unjustifiable payback
for mid-size buildings. Thanks to a cloud based platform and the
growing acceptance of wireless communication, the SmartStruxure
Light solution decreases by 50% the cost of retro-fitting a mid-size
building.

Additionally, this solution is connected « out of the box » with a set
of cloud based algorithms that automatically discovers the thermal
characteristics of the building, learns the habits of its tenants and
automatically optimizes its consumption.

Energy

Low voltage electrical distribution panels, beyond ensuring the
safety of the assets they power, collect a large number of data
which could be used to optimize the performance of these assets.
Analyzing the frequency of the electrical feedback of a motor can,
for instance, allow to detect the wear and potential failure of their
bearings or of the equipment they power.

Thanks again to the low cost of the loT platform, every distribution
panel shipped by Schneider Electric or its partners is now
connected to the cloud. Data experts and process experts
collaborate to analyze the patterns in the data coming from the
panels to come up with novel ways of optimizing their
performance. Once developed in the cloud, the corresponding
algorithms will be optimized and implemented in the intelligent
meters and breakers built into the panel, thus making it smarter
and smarter.

The connection of distribution panels to the remote platform
enables services such as demand response, allowing the
aggregation of multiple buildings and/or factories into significant
capacity that utilities can call upon at peak times.

RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT

Industry

As End Users and OEMs re-examine their automation and
operation management strategies to take advantage of the loT,
enable operational excellence and improve overall business
performance, PlantStruxure and MachineStruxure architectures
play a key role in managing convergence between informational
technology and operational technology.

Our Best-In-Class Smart Connected Products such as the Altivar
Process variable speed drive leverage loT technologies to deliver
real customer value. With its smart diagnostics based on dynamic
QR codes, and its embedded optimization algorithms such as
pump curves, the Altivar Process drive reduces downtime by up to
20%. Furthermore, its built-in energy management services and
seamless integration with business management systems provide
real operational insights contributing to operational efficiency
improvements of up to +25%.

Continuing to lead the world of Automation, the Modicon M680 is
the world's 1s ePAC - with Ethernet built right into its core,
bridging the gap between the OT and IT worlds. Thanks to
Modicon M580 you can monitor and diagnose your installation in
real-time from any location using your standard tablet and smart
phone, greatly improving the efficiency of your maintenance teams

In automation projects enhanced with Foxboro Control Systems
and Triconex Safety Instrumented Systems, Schneider Electric is
leading the way with Virtualized Engineering, also called
Engineering in the Cloud, throughout the entire project. From the
design phase to verification and testing, our customers can utilize
engineering resources and subject matter experts anywhere in the
world increasing collaboration and reducing time to first
production.

Data Centers

loT type solutions combine large networks of smart on-site devices
and powerful cloud based analytics. For multiple reasons, including
security and reliability, most of these solutions will still require
on-site computing, but with the kind of flexibility of a « private
cloud ».

Schneider Electric is working with major IT players to develop
packaged « micro data centers » that can be installed in just a few
hours on a_ site, will «discover» their environment and
self-configure, pulling functionality from Schneider Electric’s cloud
platform. Such micro data centers will be a key component of the
converged IT/OT industrial architectures mentioned earlier.

The first version of this micro data center, developed with CISCO
for traditional business applications is already commercially
available.

5.3 Improve the efficiency of R&D

With digitization, even simple products are now part of a system
comprised of its connection to the cloud, the analytics running in
this cloud and the mobile applications delivering the derived
insights to users.

While the deployment of technology platforms has allowed to
reduce both the cost and lead time of bringing new products to
market, this new complexity requires an upgrade of development
methods and tools. To address this challenge, a very ambitious
program has been launched to deploy Model Based Systems
Engineering (MBSE) throughout Schneider Electric's R&D. This
method was pioneered by Aerospace and Automotive and, thanks
to its packaging in modern toolset, now becomes applicable to
less complex systems.

From the customer requirements expressed by Marketing, a model
of the product and/or system is developed using a specific

5.4 Financing innovative startups

In 2000, Schneider Electric created an investment structure called
Schneider Electric Ventures to invest in high-tech start-ups whose
innovations fit with the Group’s future development.

In 2010, Schneider Electric Ventures became Aster Capital with the
launch of a new capital investment fund to finance innovative
start-ups operating within the areas of energy, new materials and
the environment. This second fund received a capital subscription
of EUR105 million from Schneider Electric (EUR40 million), Alstom
(EURS0 million), Solvay (EUR15 million) and in 2012 by the
European Investment Fund (EUR20 million), a benchmark financial
partner in Europe.

Managing a portfolio of partnership
opportunities

The mission of Aster Capital is to purchase minority interests in
innovative start-ups in the fields of energy and the environment
based in Europe, Israel, North America and Asia. The scouting
activities constitute a source of particularly productive partnerships
and forge contacts with more than 1,500 small and mid-sized
businesses around the world each year. In 2014, three new
investments were realized, joining the first ten companies already in
the portfolio, including EcoFactor, Lucibel and Iceotope.

Aster’s first fund currently still holds 10 equity interests in Solaire
Direct, Jet Metal Technologies, Tronics, Casanova, Tiempo,
Ordinal Software, Teem Photonics, HBA, Fludicon and Agilence.

language. This model can be used to generate mockups that can
be validated and can evolve with customers before any R&D is
committed.

The validated model then becomes the reference from which the
mechanical, electronics and software design team can work in
parallel. From the model, engineers can query libraries of reusable
components, developed on the technology platforms now
common to all businesses, thus accelerating projects while
reducing risks. Successive versions are tested against the model,
and again with customers, ensuring that final integration and
testing will go smoothly.

First pilots have confirmed the potential of MBSE and _ full
deployment has started mid-2014, with the expectation that every
program will apply this method by 2016.

and delivering relevant inputs

Aster Capital is in touch with start-ups on a daily basis. This gives
Aster Capital a unique perspective on emerging technologies,
customer needs and new market segments. The work is shared at
three levels:

z by identifying emerging trends and weak signals which may
have an impact on markets, customers and/or future Schneider
Electric business, and sharing them on a regular basis with the
leaders within Schneider Electric;

by introducing about 300 start-ups each year to Schneider
Electric teams within relevant countries, businesses and
corporate departments; and

by publishing market analyses that are presented to Schneider
Electric teams. Again this year, ten topics related to the energy
and environment sectors have been covered and shared within
Schneider Electric.

OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP’S STRATEGY, MARKETS AND BUSINESSES

1 ORGANIZATIONAL SIMPLICITY AND EFFICIENCY

Each of the business segment manages its R&D, marketing and
sales teams and is responsible for its global results.

A number of back-office functions such as finance, Human
Resources, IT systems and global marketing are handled by the
Global Functions, which have a governance role and provide
services internally.

Rationalization and optimization of synergies

The organization is deployed in accordance with three key
concepts: specialization, | mutualization and globalization.
Specialization mainly concerns sales and front-office operations.
Mutualization covers local back-office operations at the country
and regional level. Globalization concerns the six support
functions, now known as Global Functions:

z Finance;

z Marketing;

z Supply chain;

z Human Resources;

z Strategy;

z Information systems.

A substantial portion of the Global Functions’ costs is re-allocated
to the businesses using distribution keys or application bases that
are generally defined annually.

2

z Specialization: in each country, each business has its own
sales force and local leader as soon as it reaches critical mass.
also has a specialized front office in each host country to
respond more effectively to customer demand for specific
expertise. Each business segment is also responsible for its
overall results, both for product sales (in its business lines) and
he implementation of solutions (especially for end-market
segments within its scope). As solutions can consist of products
coming from different business segments and in order to define

Geographic dimension and legal structure

a single point of contact for customers, each business segment
is responsible for solutions in certain defined end-markets.
Business efforts have focused on implementing and
strengthening existing teams dedicated to meeting the specific
needs of these strategic customer segments with a strong focus
on the collaboration between the business lines, in order to
ensure these customer’s needs are met as fully as possible.

Mutualization: the business is organized around Operational
Regions: Global Operations, North America and China. These
Regions are split into 17 zones with empowered Zone
Presidents and Country Presidents, which are appointed in each
country to be the custodians of four Business in their countries:
ndustry, Infrastructure, Partner & Buildings and IT, including
Field Services. In addition, they are responsible to monitor the
ull transversal P&L of the country, deploy Schneider Electric’s
strategy in the country (including all local cross-functional topics
such as increasing cross-selling among businesses) and pool
he local back-office resources. These resources are gradually
brought together in each country or region under the Country
President’s supervision and can include multiple local support
unctions ranging from administration to project execution,
depending on the situation. In addition, the Country President
serves as the mutualization driving force and Schneider
Electric’s main representative in the country, most notably in
dealings with employees and local officials.

Globalization: major support functions that are not specific to a
given country or business are gradually globalized to increase
experience and leverage a significant scale effect around cost
and service. Manufacturing and supply chain operations, areas
of shared services or expertise (such as finance or Human
Resources), information systems, Group Strategy and global
marketing functions are now included within the Group’s Global
Functions. Global Supply Chain is continuing to focus on the
areas of global productivity, customer differentiation and
customer satisfaction.

6.2. Amore modular approach to information systems

Schneider Electric is completing a 3-year IT strategic cycle
(2012-2014) in line with the Connect company strategy. This IT
strategic cycle was comprised of four strategic directions:

standardize where it creates value: six IT domains as modular
as possible and which can be easily integrated for agility and
focused differentiation;

N

N

make diversity efficient: one ERP federation with coordinated
data in order to minimize the number of ERP migrations by
replacing only when necessary;

z working smarter: leverage a global IT platform for our
employees in order to provide an interface accessible anywhere
and anytime by end users;

z run IT as a business: clear governance rules to run IT with
efficiency, speed and security.

The IT strategy of Schneider Electric is being refreshed in order to

align with the New Company Program Schneider is On, and an

updated IT Strategic Cycle will be introduced in 2015.

6.3. Worldwide redeployment of production and supply chain resources

Schneider Electric has more than 240 plants and 100 distribution
centers around the world. Customer satisfaction is its top priority.

While working constantly to improve occupational health and
safety and = environmental protection, Schneider Electric’s
manufacturing policy aims to fulfill four key objectives, in order of
priority:

oO achieve a level of quality and service that meets or
exceeds customer expectations;

o obtain cost-competitive products while continuing to
deliver strong and consistent productivity;

Oo develop system speed and efficiency and limit production
sites’ risk exposure (currency parity, geopolitical risks and
changes in cost factors);

0 optimize capital employed in manufacturing operations.

A number of the production facilities and distribution centers are
dedicated to the global market. The other units are located as
close as possible to their end markets. Although design and/or
aesthetic features may be adapted to meet local requirements,
Schneider Electric standardizes key components as much as
possible. This global/local approach helps Schneider Electric
maximize economies of scale and optimize profitability and service
quality.
Drawing on its global scope, Schneider Electric has re-balanced
and optimized its manufacturing and supply chain resources.

In Western Europe, the United States, Japan and Australia,
adaptation plans continued to be deployed with a focus on
specializing production and supply chain units and reducing the
number of sites.

Continuous improvement ona global scale

At the same time, an industrial excellence program called
Schneider Production System (SPS) has been rolled out in all
plants to substantially and continuously improve service quality and
productivity. The program also takes environmental criteria into
account. Based on a lean manufacturing approach, SPS is

supported by the extension of Six Sigma and Quality and Value
Analysis programs across the Group. By deploying these
optimization methods globally and sharing best practices, the
Group intends to raise the operational performance of all its plants
to the same high standard.

Schneider Electric’s plants and products comply with increasingly
extensive and stringent European regulations and with international
standards governing environmental protection in all host countries.
In many cases, the Group anticipates future standards. In 1992,
Schneider Electric defined a formal environmental policy, which
was revised in 2004 to take account of changes both internally and
externally. This policy is designed to improve production
processes, promote eco-design, integrate customer expectations
into the Group’s environmental protection approach and raise
awareness among all employees and partners about environmental
protection and energy efficiency. In order to limit risks related to the
environment generally, the Group has implemented an
ISO 14001-compliant process to continuously improve the
environmental performance of its plants and supply chain centers.
Nearly all of our industrial sites have now been ISO 14001 certified,
and so we can address our efforts towards new areas for
improvement, which were initiated and/or pursued in 2012-2013,
like ISO 50001 certification (energy efficiency) as well as qualitative
and quantitative improvement of our sites’ water consumption and
industrial waste generation.

Schneider Electric has implemented a policy to systematically
identify and reduce its industrial risk in order to secure maximum
service to its customers and to minimize any impact of disaster,
whether it is internal in nature (fire) or external (natural disasters).
This policy relies on local actions to remove the identified risks
following audits led by an external firm recognized by insurers, as
well an action plan for the continuity of production. If, after
corrective actions, the risk remains too high, then the activity is
repeated at another Schneider Electric site. Since 2014, this
process has been extended to single-source suppliers in order to
reduce the risk level in five areas (financial, geopolitical, industrial,
quality and dependence on Schneider Electric activity).

ORGANIZATIONAL SIMPLICITY AND EFFICIENCY

The segmented response to customer needs

In 2012, Schneider Electric launched the « Tailored Supply Chain »
program as part of the company program Connect, with the aim to
better align the supply chain set-up with the needs and behaviors
of each customer segment (distributors, partners, panel
builders, F U.D

Six initiatives were defined to support the transformation of the
supply chain:

z purchasing: step up purchasing to drive proactive planning of
procurement;

optimization of the industrial operation: manage the
operation of critical components to improve lead-time to
customers (suppliers, factories, logistics);

supply chain flow redesign: reduce lead-time through
optimization of plant and distribution center footprint and flow
design;

transportation rationalization: increase partnerships with
selected carriers to improve customer service;

industrial planning: build best-in-class planning process by
customer segment;

IT capability: align information systems strategy with this
segmentation.

This approach required a more dynamic industrial strategy around
how we serve our Clients, how to configure our products,
equipment and services for our customers and how to deliver to
those customers, while at the same time, simplifying the way we
work and therefore focusing on creating value for our customers by
streamlining our decision-making processes and
organizational structure.

N

This led to the announcement of a new Industrial Organization
or 2013, structured around eight regions (Europe, CIS, China,
ndia, Pacific, Asia, North America, South America) which groups
all of Schneider Electric industrial activities together in these
regions. In addition, this also led to the verticalization of all
Purchasing activities to simplify and unify its contact with suppliers.

The digitization of the supply chain

n 2013, Schneider Electric put emphasis on digitization as a way
‘0 accelerate and intensify its transformation.

For the supply chain, this approach aims to synchronize suppliers
and plants through distribution centers and carriers to improve
service to customers. Many programs have been launched in order
to offer new features and improve the responsiveness in relation to
market demand supported by new technologies.

Supply chain optimization will benefit from the flow model,
combined with the integration of the IT systems of our logistics
partners with cloud technology. Similarly, a partnership with Kinaxis
will enable the « digitization » of industrial planning and extend the
scope. This technology facilitates interaction loops between the
different functions and improves our responsiveness to customers
as well as significantly reducing the value of fixed assets in
inventory. Finally, the development of new features tailored to each
customer segment on our targeted computer systems (of the
supply chain) will be supported by a strengthened IT convergence
plan.

This digitization of the supply chain fully meets the priorities of the
Group’s industrial strategy targeting first customer satisfaction
while reducing costs for increasing responsiveness and reducing
capital employed.

Akey competitive advantage for our customers

All of these efforts to improve the supply chain have been
recognized well outside the company. In September 2014 Gartner,
a leading IT research and advisory firm, ranked Schneider Electric’s
supply chain 22nd in Europe and 67th worldwide, an improvement
of 34 places in two years.

The Group’s aim for the next few years is to turn this into a
competitive advantage through customer recognition that we offer
the best logistics solutions. The new 2015-2020 company
program aims to drastically improve the capacity and response
speed of the supply chain while strengthening economic and
ecological efficiency in order to even better serve our customers by
providing them with a customized logistics response that meets
their expectations while ensuring sustainability.

6.4 Purchasing: selection and internationalization

Purchasing corresponds to around 50% of revenue and plays a
crucial role in the Group’s technical and business performance. As
part of its program to optimize Purchasing, the Group has sought
to source a_ significant portion of its purchases from the
top-performing suppliers (« recommended » suppliers) and aims to
increase local sourcing in the new economies to more than 50%.

Schneider Electric primarily purchases prefabricated components,
raw materials (silver, copper, aluminum, steel and_ plastics),
electronic and electrical products and services. The supplier list

2014 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 4$)/& *% &&-&$53*$

includes multinationals as well as small, medium and intermediate
sized companies.

Suppliers are selected for the quality of their products and
services, their adherence to _ delivery deadlines, _ their
competitiveness, their expertise, their innovative capacity and their
commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR). As a
signatory to the United Nations’ Global Compact and in view of its
recommendation of ISO 26000 to its principal suppliers, Schneider
Electric encourages its suppliers to join this sustainable
development process and its continuous improvement.

> 7. Risk Factors

As described in Chapter 3.9 Internal control and risk management,
Schneider Electric regularly analyses the risks and threats it faces,
which has revealed six major risk categories as follows:

z risk factors related to the Group’s business, which also include
the solutions business, supplier risks and competitive threats;

z industrial and environmental risks that also include risks such as
natural catastrophes and political disturbances, etc.;

RISK FACTORS

z information system risks and cyber threats;

z market risks covering currency risks and raw material price
fluctuation risks;

z legal risks that also cover intellectual property;
z litigation and related risks.

The Group’s main risks and threats are summarized in a chart
of overall risks based on their impact and probability.

Risk factors related to the Group’s business

Schneider Electric operates worldwide,
in competitive and cyclical markets

The worldwide markets for the Group’s products are competitive in
terms of pricing, quality of products, systems and _ services,
development and_ introduction time for new _ offers.
Schneider Electric faces strong competitors, some of whom are
larger than we are or are developing in certain lower cost countries.
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in economic growth cycles
and to the respective levels of investments within the different
countries in which we operate. The Group’s widespread
geographic coverage and diversified end markets enable us to ride
out downtums on specific markets.

As 44% of the Group’s revenue is generated in emerging
countries, we are exposed to the risks associated with those
markets.

The Group’s wide international presence exposes us to many
economic, legal and political risks in the countries in which we
operate. These include risks arising from social unrest (particularly
strikes and walk-outs), political instability, unforeseen regulatory
changes, restrictions on capital transfers and other obstacles to
free trade, and local tax laws. All of these risks may have an
adverse effect on the Group’s operations, results or financial
position.

Schneider Electric has implemented procedures designed to
protect it as far as possible from these risks, which are generally
beyond our control, and to manage them as effectively as possible.
These procedures include quarterly business reviews in which
performance and projections are monitored, in terms of activity,
action plans, results to date and forecasts, at all organizational
levels of the Group (see section 3.9 Internal control and _ risk
management). The Group also has the necessary competencies to
manage these risks, mainly through our central functions (finance,
legal, tax and customs).

The growth and success of the Group’s products
depend on its ability to constantly adapt to and
leverage new technologies to deliver high value
products and solutions

The markets in which Schneider Electric operates are experiencing
rapid evolutions due to the introduction of innovative technologies,
such as loT and Big Data. Customers expect smarter and smarter
products with open interfaces enabling them to be tightly
integrated into more and more complex software based solutions.
The resulting digitization of products, including native Web
connectivity opens numerous new opportunities, but will also
accelerate the convergence of IT and OT technologies, thus
making it possible for new players to enter our markets. The
widespread usage of mobile devices creates new expectations
from customers as far as the general usability of products. Last but
not least, the increased connectivity of products increases the risk
of cyber attacks.

To meet these challenges, the Group has increased its investments
in the areas of embedded control (hardware and software), and
cyber-security. A Group-wide initiative aims at developing common
control technologies, leveraging such advances as « controller on a
chip », resulting in smart and open products that are « natively »
secure. More and more, the development of products goes hand
in hand with the development of life-cycle services leveraging Web
connectivity to deliver superior lifetime value to our customers.
Such services not only open new recurring revenue opportunities
for Schneider Electric, but reinforce the Group’s competitive
position versus potential new entrants.

The increased software content of the Group’s solutions has
resulted in specific investments in the area of user experience. The
standards and techniques developed for software solutions apply
readily to smart phones and allow development teams to
seamlessly complement products and solutions with state of the
art mobile applications.

OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP’S STRATEGY, MARKETS AND BUSINESSES

RISK FACTORS

Regarding cyber-security, a specific investment program has been
launched to develop specific capabilities. Specialists have been
embedded in the main development teams/centers are involved
from the early phases of the design to make products inherently
safe. A constant monitoring of emerging threats has been
implemented in partnership with specialized firms and specific
incident response processes have been established to support
customers in case of cyber-attack against Schneider Electric
products.

The market for software-based solutions has faster cycles than
some of Schneider Electric’s hardware markets. As a provider of
critical infrastructure management solutions, the Group
nevertheless does not compromise its standards of outstanding
reliability and security. As a consequence, a program is underway
to generalize the latest standards of System Engineering, allowing
different teams to work in parallel on complex products or
systems, while assuring the highest quality standards. Coupled
with techniques such as early prototyping, leveraging 3D printing,
and simulation, these efforts contribute to the continued reduction
of go-to-market lead times.

To sustainably manage these challenges, the Group needs to
constantly invest in the competencies of its 11000 R&D engineers,
both to reinforce its traditional domains of expertise and develop
new ones. Worldwide competency networks, which extend into
universities, research centers and partners remain the backbone of
Schneider Electric’s R&D organization. Each network constantly
monitors emerging technologies and competitive trends in its
domain, decides the launch of research efforts to position the
Group ahead of those trends and ensures the related upgrade of
the network’s talent pool.

Schneider Electric’s strategy involves growth
through acquisitions and mergers that
are potentially difficult to execute

The Group’s strategy involves strengthening its positions through
acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and mergers.
Changes in the scope of consolidation during 2014 are described
in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements (Chapter 5).

External growth projects are examined in detail by the businesses
and corporate functions (strategy, finance, legal affairs, tax and
Human Resources) concerned, under a rigorous internal process
developed and led at Group level. A launch committee is
responsible for initiating the review process to identify the risks and
opportunities associated with each external growth project, while a
number of validation committees review the results on an ongoing
basis. Projects that successfully come through the review process
are submitted for approval to the Group Acquisitions Committee
made up of the main members of senior management. The largest
projects require the prior approval of the Chairman and CEO, and,
in some cases, the board of directors.

External growth transactions are inherently risky because of the
difficulties that may arise in integrating people, operations,
technologies and products, and the related acquisition,
administrative and other costs.

This is why an integration procedure for new acquisitions has been
drawn up. The integration of acquisitions is a process that extends
over a period of six to 24 months depending on the type and size
of the newly acquired company. The integration scenario for each
acquisition varies depending on whether the business was
acquired to strengthen or extend the Group’s existing line-up or
enter a new segment. There are a number of different integration
scenarios, ranging from total integration to separate organization.

2014 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 4$)/& *% &&-&$53*$

An integration plan is drawn up for each acquisition and submitted
to the Acquisitions Committee for approval. The plan is
implemented by an integration manager who reports to a Steering
Committee that initially meets at monthly intervals and then on a
quarterly basis.

The unit that presents the acquisition project is accountable to the
Group’s senior management for meeting clearly defined business
plan targets covering future performance and expected synergies.
Actual performance is measured against business plan targets
during quarterly business reviews and, for the largest acquisitions,
by the board of directors.

Value in use is determined by discounting estimated future cash
flows that will be generated by the tested assets, generally over a
period of not more than five years. These future cash flows are
based on Group management’s economic assumptions and
operating forecasts. The discount rate corresponds to Schneider
Electric’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) at the valuation
date plus a risk premium depending on the region in question (local
risk-free rate), the nature of the target’s business (appropriate
beta), and the structure of the financing (taking into account the
debt to equity ratio and risk premium on the debt). The Group’s
WACC stood at 7.6% at December 31, 2014, slightly decreasing
compared to the 2013 financial year. The perpetuity growth rate
was 2%, unchanged on the previous financial year.

Goodwill is allocated to a Cash Generating Unit (CGU) when initially
recognized. The CGU allocation is done on the same basis as
used by Group management to monitor operations and assess
synergies deriving from acquisitions. Impairment tests are
performed at the level of the cash generating unit (CGU), J Fn
2014 the Buildings & Partner, Infrastructure, Industry and IT
businesses. Details on asset impairment are provided in note 1.11
to the consolidated financial statements (Chapter 5).

Where the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is lower than its
book value, an impairment loss is recognized. Where the tested
CGU comprises goodwill, any impairment losses are firstly
deducted therefrom.

The Group’s success depends on its ability to
attract and retain qualified individuals, and
engaging its workforce to support our Growth
ambition for the future

Competition for highly qualified management and_ technical
personnel is intense in the Group’s industry, and becomes a bigger
challenge as the Group continues on its trajectory of growth in
mature economies as well as in new economies. Future continued
success depends in part on the Group’s ability to hire, assimilate
and retain engineers, sales people and other qualified personnel,
especially in the area of energy efficiency solutions. This ability can
only result from a strong employee-centric Human Resources
strategy and its ability to prepare its workforce for the future
through learning and identifying talent within the organization.

The Group’s Human Resources strategy is strongly anchored in its
« Total Employee Experience » philosophy, ensuring that Human
Resources offers at every stage of an employee’s life cycle within
the company remain attractive in order to recognize, reward and
retain employees. The Human Resources Function is valued as a
backbone of support for the business, bringing efficiency and
quality to the employee experience. Our entire HR Strategy is being
developed to support our 2020 vision on leadership and culture at
Schneider Electric. It defines the values and transformation we
want to accomplish, one of them being to increase our diversity.

OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP’S STRATEGY, MARKETS AND BUSINESSES

We believe it is key if we want to keep on meeting expectations of
our customers through ongoing innovation. Our multi-polar
organization with senior leaders in every continent has been
created to facilitate the growth of talents in every part of the world.

To nurture the resilient and innovative workforce required for its
success, the Group encourages employees to take ownership of
managing their performance and career development. From the
point of joining, employees are immersed in a learning culture
founded upon three pillars: Education, Experience and Exposure
(83Es). Learning initiatives are actively driven by Human Resources;
internal processes and programs are geared towards creating
learning opportunities for employees; managers are encouraged to
guide and coach employees in their individual development
journeys. At the end, we want our employees to feel accountable
of their development and success at Schneider Electric.

During 2014 further steps were taken to reinforce the active
management of talent at all levels and in all parts of the company.
A state-of-the-art talent management system was introduced to
support employees in planning their career development, while
giving managers and HR specialists enhanced visibility to plan for
longer-term career development and succession to critical roles in
the organization. Our culture of systematically reviewing talent at

Industrial and environmental risks

Defective products or design flaws may cause
bodily harm or property damage and subject us
to product liability claims and other adverse
effects.

Despite its testing and quality procedures, the Group’s products
might not operate properly or might contain design faults or
defects, which could give rise to disputes in respect of our liability
as seller or manufacturer, notably in Europe, where liability related
to defective products could lead to a loss of revenue, claims under
warranty and legal proceedings. Such disputes could reduce
demand for our products or harm our reputation for safety and
quality. To prevent or limit these risks, Schneider Electric
immediately recalls products if there are any doubts whatsoever

RISK FACTORS

every level of the organization gives fair opportunity to everyone to
progress.

The Group’s acquisitions and growth ambitions have increased its
global presence and internationalized the profile of its workforce.
This and company reorganization highlighted the importance and
necessity of working well together. Employee engagement efforts
are therefore key to creating a common Schneider Electric identity
while promoting diversity and inclusion. The Group introduced a
global Diversity & Inclusion policy in 2014, and has for the past few
years regularly sought both blue and white-collar feedback through
bi-annual company-wide employee engagement surveys. Listening
to our employees and acting upon their feedback is a key pillar of
our HR Strategy and actions.

These employee engagement efforts support employer branding
initiatives; the Group has actively reached out to prospective
employees through social media platforms and events for targeted
groups, and has continued to gain accolades as an « Employer of
Choice ».

Work continues to be done in these and other areas so that HR is
equipped to effectively deliver its employer value proposition and
further support the Group in its future endeavours.

that a product or one of its components is not 100% safe for

our global recall of Vigi Compact NS/NSX circuit breakers
produced between 2009 and 2011, which began in 2011 and was
continued in 2012 and 2013. It was concluded in 2014.

As in 2013, no broad product recall was begun in 2014.

Some of the expenses incurred by Schneider Electric in the
context of product recalls are covered by the liability insurance
program described in the « Insurance » section below.

OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP’S STRATEGY, MARKETS AND BUSINESSES

RISK FACTORS

The Group’s plants and products are subject to
environmental laws and regulations

Our plants and products are subject to extensive and increasingly
stringent environmental laws and regulations in the countries in
which we operate.

To limit risks related to the environment in general, the Group is
involved in a process to continuously improve the environmental
performance of its plants and products. In 1992, Schneider Electric
drafted a formal environmental policy. This policy is designed to
improve production processes, promote eco-design, and integrate
customer expectations into our environmental protection
approach. This policy also aims to identify, assess and prevent
environmental risks, in order to guarantee full compliance with all
environmental laws and regulations applicable to the Group’s
businesses, particularly those in force in the European Union and
considered more rigorous (notably the WEEE, RoHS directives and
REACH Regulation). We record environmental provisions when the
risks can be reliably measured or it is probable that clean-up work
will be performed and the related costs can be reasonably
estimated. Provisions for environmental risks __ totaled
EUR308 million as of December 31, 2014. If no risk has been
identified, Schneider Electric will not estimate the financial cost of
environmental risks. We expect our spending on environmental
compliance programs to increase as a result of changes to existing
environmental regulations and the introduction of new regulations.

Information systems risk

The Group operates, either directly or through service providers, a
wide range of highly complex information systems, including
servers, networks, applications and databases, that are essential
to the efficiency of our sales and manufacturing processes. Failure
of any of these hardware or software systems, a fulfillment failure
by a service provider, human error or computer viruses could
adversely affect the quality of service offered by the Group.

The Group regularly examines alternative solutions to protect
against this type of risk and has developed contingency plans to
mitigate the effects of any information system failure. Dedicated
governance structures have been set up to manage relations with
service providers responsible for outsourced IT systems
operations.

Problems may also be encountered during the deployment of new
applications or software. In particular, in the last few years, the
Group has developed ERPs systems under SAP, which it started
to roll out in 2008. This roll-out process has been carried out fully

2014 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 4$)/& *% &&-&$53*$

There can be no guarantee that Schneider Electric will not be
required to pay significant fines or compensation as a result of
past, current or future breaches of environmental laws and
regulations by companies that are currently or were previously
members of the Group. This exposure exists even if the Group is
not responsible for the breaches, in cases where they were
committed in the past by companies or businesses that were not
part of the Group at the time.

Schneider Electric may also be exposed to the risk of claims for
breaches of environmental laws and regulations. Such claims could
adversely affect Schneider Electric’s financial position and
reputation, despite the efforts and investments made to comply at
all times with all applicable environmental laws and regulations as
they change.

lf Schneider Electric fails to conduct its operations in compliance
with the applicable environmental laws and regulations, the judicial
or regulatory authorities could require the Group to conduct
investigations and/or implement costly clean-up measures to deal
with the current or past contamination of current or former
production facilities or off-site waste disposal facilities, and to scale
back or temporarily or permanently close facilities in accordance
with the applicable environmental laws and regulations.

Finally, the Group may be exposed to new risks related to recent
acquisitions. In application of IFRS rules, these risks are assessed
in the framework of the allocation of the purchase price, as
specified in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

or partially in a number of countries since 2008, and is continuing
in France, Brazil the United States and other countries.

n addition to the deployment of ERP systems, the Group is
deploying various applications aimed at enhancing commercial and
supply chain efficiency.

n view of these projects’ complexity, extensive functionalities and
heir worldwide deployment, the Group has set up dedicated
governance and cost control structures to manage these issues
and limit the related risks.

However, despite the Group’s policy of establishing governance
structures and contingency plans, there can be no assurance that
information systems projects will not be subject to technical
problems and/or execution delays. While it is difficult to accurately
quantify the impact of any such problems or delays, they could
have an adverse effect on inventory levels, service quality and,
consequently, on our financial results.
OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP’S STRATEGY, MARKETS AND BUSINESSES

Market risks

Interest rate risk

The Group is exposed to risks associated with the effect of
changing interest rates in different countries. Interest rate risk on
borrowings is managed at the Group level, based on consolidated
debt and taking into consideration market conditions in order to
optimize overall borrowing costs. Most bond debt is fixed rate. At
December 31, 2014, 79% of the Group’s gross debt was fixed
rate.

Maturities of financial liabilities are presented in note 24.1 to the
consolidated financial statements.

A 1% increase in interest rates would have a positive impact of
around EUR10 million on the Group’s net financial expense.

The financial instruments used to hedge the exposure of the Group
to fluctuations in interest rates are described in note 26 to the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2014.

The Group’s international operations expose it
to currency exchange risk

Due to the fact that a significant proportion of transactions of
Schneider Electric are denominated in currencies other than the
euro, the Group is exposed to currency risk. If the Group is not
able to hedge these risks, fluctuations in exchange rates between
the euro and these currencies can have a significant impact on our
results and distort year-on-year performance comparisons.

We manage our exposure to currency risk to reduce the sensitivity
of earnings to changes in exchange rates through hedging
programs relating to receivables, payables and cash flows, which
are primarily hedged by means of forward purchases and sales.

Depending on market conditions, risks in the main currencies may
be hedged based on cash flow forecasting using contracts that
expire in 12 months or less.

Schneider Electric’s currency hedging policy is to protect our
subsidiaries against risks on transactions denominated in a
currency other than their functional currency. More than twenty
currencies are involved, with the US dollar, Chinese Yuan,
Singapore Dollar, Australian Dollar, British Pound, the Hungarian
Forint and Russian Rubbles representing the most significant
sources of those risks. The financial instruments used to hedge our
exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates are described in
note 26 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2014 (Chapter 5).

In 2014, revenue in foreign currencies amounted to
EUR19.7 billion, including around EUR7 billion in US dollar and
3.4 billion in Chinese yuan.

The main exposure of the Group in terms of currency exchange
risk is related to the US dollar, the Chinese yuan and to currencies
linked to the US dollar. The Group estimates that in the current
structure of its operations, a 5% increase of the euro compared to
the US dollar would have a negligible impact on operating margin
(a translation effect of EUR44 million on EBITA).

RISK FACTORS

Equity risk

Exposure to equity risk primarily relates to treasury shares but
remains limited. The Group does not use any financial instruments
to hedge these positions.

An increase in raw material prices could have
negative consequences

The Group is exposed to fluctuations in energy and raw material
prices, in particular steel, copper, aluminum, silver, lead, nickel,
zinc and plastics. If we are not able to hedge, compensate for or
pass on to customers any such increased costs, this could have
an adverse impact on our financial results.

The Group has, however, implemented certain procedures to limit
exposure to rising non-ferrous and precious raw material prices.
The purchasing departments of the operating units report their
purchasing forecasts to the Corporate Finance and Treasury
Department. Purchase commitments are hedged using forward
contracts, swaps and, to a lesser extent, options.

The financial instruments used to hedge our exposure to
fluctuations in raw material prices are described in note 26 to the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2014.

In 2014, purchases of raw materials totaled around EUR2 billion,
including around EUR900 million for non-ferrous and precious
metals, of which roughly 57% was for copper. The Group enters
into swap and options agreements intended to hedge all or part of
its non-ferrous and precious metals purchases in order to limit the
impact of price volatility of these raw materials on our results. At
December 31, 2014, the Group had hedged positions with a
nominal value ofEUR271 million on these transactions.

Counterparty risk

Financial transactions are entered into with carefully selected
counterparties. Banking counterparties are chosen according to
the customary criteria, including the credit rating issued by an
independent rating agency.

Group policy consists of diversifying counterparty risks and
periodic controls are performed to check compliance with the
related rules.

In addition, the Group takes out substantial credit insurance and
uses other types of guarantees to limit the risk of losses on trade
accounts receivable.

Liquidity risk

Liquidity is provided by the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and
undrawn confirmed lines of credit. As of December 31, 2014, the
Group had access to cash and cash equivalents totaling
EUR2.4 billion. As of December 31, 2014, the Group had EUR
2.4 billion in undrawn confirmed lines of credit, of which
EUR2.4 billion matures after December 2015.

The Group’s credit rating enables it to raise significant long-term
financing and attract a diverse investor base. The Group currently
has an A- (negative outlook) credit rating from Standard & Poor’s

RISK FACTORS

and an AS credit rating from Moody’s. The Group’s liabilities and
their terms and conditions are described in note 24 of Chapter 5.

In line with the Group’s overall policy of conservatively managing
liquidity risk and protecting our financial position, when negotiating
new liquidity facilities the Group avoids the inclusion of clauses that
would have the effect of restricting the availability of credit lines,
such as covenants requiring compliance with certain financial
ratios. As of December 31, 2014, Schneider Electric SE had no
financing or confirmed lines of credit that were subject to
covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios.

The loan agreements or lines of credit for some of our liquidity
facilities include cross-default clauses. If we were to default on any

Legal risks

Our products are subject to varying national and
international standards and regulations

Our products, which are sold in national markets worldwide, are
subject to regulations in each of those markets, as well as
various supranational regulations (sales restrictions, tariffs, ta
laws, security standards, F U.DChanges to any of these regulation:
or standards or their applicability to the Group’s business cou

result in lower earnings and profitability.

aa

Our products are also subject to multiple quality and safety
controls and regulations, and are governed by both national and
supranational standards. The majority of our products comply with
world-recognized International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
standards as well as with the applicable rules in the European
Union, and in particular the REACH and RoHs rules. Any necessary
capital investments or costs of specific measures for compliance
with new or more stringent standards and regulations could have a
negative impact on Group operations.

n addition, in the majority of the markets on which its products are
sold, Schneider Electric is subject to national and supranational
regulations governing competition. If the Group is implicated in
hese areas, this could have a significant impact on the Group’s
businesses, results and financial position. However, to mitigate
hese risks, the Group completed its « Principles of Responsibility »
by implementing a GLOBAL COMPETITION LAW POLICY that has
been widely rolled out within the Group, together with a training
program set up by the Legal Affairs Department.

Risks related to products sold

In addition, in case of malfunction or failure of one of its products,
systems or solutions, Schneider Electric could incur liability arising
from any resulting tangible or intangible damages, or personal
injury. Similarly, the Group could incur liability based on errors in
the design of a product, system or solution or because of a
malfunction related to the interface with other products or systems.
The failure of a product, system or solution may involve costs
related to the product recall, result in new expenditures for

2014 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 4$)/& *% &&-&$53*$

of our liquidity facilities, we could be required to repay the sums
due on some of these facilities.

Moreover, anticipated reimbursement provisions exist for certain
financing and lines of credit in case of change of control. Under
these provisions, the debt holders may demand repayment if a
shareholder or shareholders acting together hold more than 50%
of the company’s shares, for the majority of contracts, and this
event triggers a downgrading of the company’s rating. As of
December 31, 2014, EUR4.8 billion of the Group’s financing and
lines of credit had these types of provisions.

development, and launch technical and economic resources. Such
costs could have a significant impact on the profitability and cash
and cash equivalents of the Group. The business reputation of
Schneider Electric could also be negatively impacted.

To prevent these risks, Schneider Electric has implemented quality
procedures at the level of design, development and production of
its products, systems and solutions. In case of product returns, the
type and source of the failures are analyzed and corrective actions
are implemented. The Group has also put in place insurance
coverage to cover its civil liability and the risk of product recalls
(see section 1.7 Risk factors on Insurance policy).

The development and success of the
Group’s products depends on its ability
to protect its intellectual property rights

The future success of Schneider Electric depends to a significant
extent on the development and protection of patents, knowledge
and trademarks (« intellectual property rights »). Third parties may
also infringe its intellectual property rights, and the Group may
have to expend significant resources monitoring, protecting and
enforcing its rights. If we fail to protect or enforce our intellectual
property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the
unauthorized use of intellectual property rights remains difficult to
control, particularly in foreign countries whose laws do not always
effectively ensure the protection of these rights. They could be
counterfeited or used without the consent of Schneider Electric,
which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and
operating profit.

To mitigate this risk, the patents developed or purchased by the
Group are tracked by the Industrial Property team within the
Finance and Control - Legal Affairs Department. All intellectual
property queries are centralized and managed by this team for the
whole Group and in coordination with the — other
Finance and Control - Legal Affairs Departments it ensures that the
Group’s interests are defended throughout the world. The same
approach and organization applies for the Group’s brands
portfolio.

OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP’S STRATEGY, MARKETS AND BUSINESSES

Disputes

Following public offers launched in 1993 by SPEP (the holding
company of the Group at the time) for its Belgian subsidiaries
Cofibel and Cofimines, proceedings were initiated against former
Schneider Electric executives in connection with the former
Empain-Schneider Group’s management of its Belgian
subsidiaries, notably the Tramico sub-group. At the end of
March 2006, a criminal court in Brussels, Belgium, ruled that some
of the defendants were responsible for certain of the alleged
offenses and that some of the plaintiffs’ claims were admissible.
The plaintiffs claimed damages representing losses of
EURS5.3 million stemming from alleged management decisions that
reduced the value of or undervalued assets presented in the
prospectus used in conjunction with the offering, as well as losses
of EUR4.9 million in relation to transactions carried out by PB
Finance, a company in which Cofibel and Cofimines then held
minority interests. In its ruling, the court also appointed an expert
to assess the loss suffered by those plaintiffs whose claims were
ruled admissible. The expert’s report was submitted in 2008. The
defendants and the companies held civilly liable contest the
amounts provided by the legal expert in their entirety on the basis
of such reports drawn up by Deloitte. Schneider Electric and its
Belgian subsidiaries Cofibel and Cofimines were held civilly liable
for the actions of their senior executives who were found liable.
Schneider Electric is paying the legal expenses not covered by the
insurance of the former executives involved. After a settlement
agreement was signed with a group of plaintiffs, the case now
remains pending before the Brussels Appeals Court, due to (i)
appeals against parts of the March 2006 ruling and (ii) a ruling
made in2011 by the Court of First Instance regarding the
admissibility of the plaintiffs’ claims.

In connection with the disposal of Spie Batignolles, Schneider
Electric booked provisions to cover the risks associated with
certain major contracts and projects. Most of the risks were closed
during 1997. Provisions were booked for the remaining risks,
based on management’s best estimate of the potential financial
impact. One of the main issues concerns pending litigation in
France with SNCF before the administrative court.

New files implicating the Group for Spie Batignolles’ past activities
could still arise and result in costs associated with defending the
Group’s interests.

Schneider Electric and other companies in the high voltage sector
have been involved in legal proceedings with regard to an alleged
agreement initiated by the European Commission concerning gas
insulated switchgears (GIS). These procedures involve two former
Group subsidiaries operating in the high voltage segment that were
sold in 2001 and that are now part of the Siemens group.
Schneider Electric did not appeal the decision made by the
Commission with regard to this matter on January 24, 2007 and
was fined EUR8.1 million. The Group recovered two-thirds
reimbursement of the amount of this fine from its two former
subsidiaries in 2012 after multiple legal actions in application of the
decision by the Commercial Court of Grenoble. However, this
decision, although provisionally executed, is subject to an appeal
to the Court of Appeals of Grenoble. In addition, a final decision on

RISK FACTORS

the entire GIS issue was made on April 10, 2014, by the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU), which specifies how the fine
paid by Schneider Electric could be divided between Schneider
Electric and its two former subsidiaries. In this context, a
settlement could be reached between Schneider Electric and its
two former subsidiaries in 2015.

In relation to the GIS disputes, on May 21, 2010, British company
Power networks (formerly EDF Energy UK) launched a claim
against the same companies, including Schneider Electric, for
damages of GBP15 million in the High Court in London, England.
This claim is currently being investigated and there were no
significant developments in 2014.

n addition, some Group entities worldwide, including Brazil and
Pakistan, are directly or indirectly cited in anti-trust proceedings
without, however, the proven or serious risk of conviction in this
regard having been identified to date.

Schneider Electric was also among 2,000 companies worldwide
hat were mentioned in the Volcker report on the Oil for Food
program published by the UN in October 2005. Schneider Electric
ndustries SAS was investigated by the French judiciary in 2010 in
relation to this report, which stated that the Group had entered into
agreements with the Iraqi government between 2000 and 2004
under which surcharge payments totaling approximately
USD450,000 are alleged to have been made to the Iraqi
government. In May 2018, in accordance with the indictment of the
Public Prosecutor's Department, the judge referred Schneider
Electric Industries SAS and 13 other French companies to the
criminal court, which should render its decision in 2015.

The discussions entered into with ERDF in 2013 regarding a
potential defect designated « soft button » (non-reset) affecting
connection breakers (DB90) produced between 1990 and 2010
led to a transaction that was signed in July 2014. This transaction
provides for the delivery to ERDF in 2017 of certain products,
whose cost has been provisioned.

Various other claims, administrative notices and legal proceedings
have been filed against the Group concerning such issues as
contractual demands, counterfeiting, risk of bodily harm linked to
asbestos in certain older products and work contracts.

Finally, note that in the context of recent acquisitions, of the
companies such as Electroshield and Invensys, Schneider Electric
could be exposed to new risks and have inherited litigation that
may have a significant financial impact in the coming years, but for
which, however, numerical estimates cannot be made at this point.

Although it is impossible to forecast the results and/or costs of
these proceedings with certainty, Schneider Electric considers that
they will not, by their nature, have significant effects on the Group’s
business, assets, financial position or profitability. The company is
not aware of any other governmental, court or arbitration
proceedings, which are pending or which threaten the company,
that are liable to have or, during the last 12 months have had, a
material effect on the financial position or profitability of the
company and/or the Group.

OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP’S STRATEGY, MARKETS AND BUSINESSES

RISK FACTORS

Insurance policy

Schneider Electric’s general policy for managing insurable risks is
designed to defend the interests of employees and customers and
to protect the company’s assets, the environment and_ its
shareholders’ investment.

This strategy entails:
identifying and analyzing the impact of the main risks;

preventing risks and protecting industrial equipment; definition of
protection standards for sites (including when those are
managed by third parties) against the risk of fire and malicious
intent, audits of the main sites by an independent loss
prevention company, roll-out of a self-assessment questionnaire
for the other Group sites;

drawing up of business continuity plans, in particular for the
Group main sites and critical suppliers;

roll-out of crisis management tools by the Group’s Security
Department;
carrying out hazard and vulnerability studies and safety
management for people and equipment;

implementing global insurance programs negotiated at the Group
level for all subsidiaries with insurers meeting the criteria for
financial position recognized by insurance and reinsurance players;
optimization of financing for frequent, low amplitude risks
through retentions managed either directly (deductibles) or
through captive insurance companies.

Liability insurance

The insurance program established on January 1, 2012, for a
period of three years was pursued in 2014. This program deployed
on more than 70 countries provides coverage and limits in line with
the current size of the Group and its evolving risks and
commitments.

Certain specific risks, such as aeronautic, nuclear and
environmental risk, are covered by specific insurance programs.

Property damage and business interruption
insurance

The global insurance program put in place on July 1, 2012 was
renewed as of July 1, 2014 for a duration of two years. This is an
« all risks except » contract which covers events that could affect
Schneider Electric’s property (including fire, explosion, natural
disaster, machinery breakdown) as well as business interruption
resulting from those risks. The EUR350 million global limit of
indemnity has been increased for the largest sites. Certain
guarantees in particular, natural disasters and machinery
breakdown have lower insurance caps. These limits were
determined on the basis of available capacity on the market, loss

scenarios prepared by the prevention company that carries out the
audits of our industrial sites and, for earthquake risk, modelling
carried out by specialized companies.

Assets are insured at replacement value.

Shipping and transport insurance

The insurance program that covers all risks of loss or damage to
goods while in transit, including intragroup shipments was renewed
with the same insurer on January 1, 2014.

Erection all risk insurance

An erection all risk insurance program set up in 2011 to provide
cover for damages to work and equipment for projects taking
place at our clients’ premises, was renewed in April 2013 for two
years.

Other risks

In addition, Schneider Electric has taken out specific cover in
response to certain local conditions, regulations or the
requirements of certain risks, projects and businesses.

Self-insurance

To optimize costs, Schneider Electric self-insures certain frequent,
low-amplitude risks through two insurance captive companies:

za captive company based in Luxembourg provides property
damage reinsurance worldwide capped at EUR 5 million per
year and liability reinsurance outside USA and Canada capped
at EUR17 million per year;

for the entities located in USA and Canada, an insurance captive
company based in Vermont (USA) is used to standardize
deductibles for civil liability, workers compensation and automobile
liability. These retentions range from USD1 million to USD5 million
per claim, depending on the risk. An actuary validates the
provisions recorded by the captive company each year.

The cost of self-insured claims is not material at the Group level.

Cost of insurance programs

The cost (including tax) of the Group’s main insurance plans,

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AT THE HEART OF OUR STRATEGY

1. Sustainable development
at the heart of our strategy

Social and environmental commitments, governance, reducing
CO, emissions, launching solutions that respect the planet, social
changes, local and regional positioning, corporate citizenship,
ethics, business and poverty -the challenges of sustainable
development have never been as significant to Schneider Electric’s
customers and stakeholders as they are today.

The Group is committed to meeting energy challenges while acting
civically and responsibly at all its locations, with measured progress
plans, based on international standards for corporate social
responsibility, whose results are audited and shared openly
internally and externally.

Since the Sustainable Development Department was founded
more than 10 years ago, the Group’s commitment to sustainable
development has evolved in line with the Group’s continuing
innovation. The Group’s sustainable development policy initially
focused on internal issues, teamed with initiatives for the
professional integration of French youth; now it also includes
solutions that help meet today’s main energy challenges (energy
efficiency and access to energy) as well as global social
responsibility.

Schneider Electric's commitment to offering sustainable and
responsible solutions for its customers aims to:

z bring products and solutions to the market that waste less
energy and promote environmentally sound production and
consumption;

z provide energy to the 1.3 billion” people who have no access to
electricity and provide sustainable economic development.

Schneider Electric’s corporate commitment means dynamic social
responsibility, based on the Group’s employees:

z principles governing ethics and responsibility;
z sites and products that respect the environment;
z employee development;

z policies that support and develop the communities in which
Schneider Electric operates.

Schneider Electric uses its global Human Resources policies (see
pages 76-90), external commitments (see page 53), ethical code of
conduct and the associated professional alert program (see
pages 62-65) to strive for the respect of Human Rights in every
aspect: non-discrimination, abolition of forced labor, prohibition of
child labor, freedom of association and the right to collective
bargaining, health and safety, training, remuneration, social
coverage, etc.

Schneider Electric extends this commitment to civil society through
its community support and development program (see
pages 91-100): the right to decent living standards (access to
energy program and Foundation emergency relief programs), the
right to education and training (training program for underprivileged
people and integration program in France), local economic
development (social investment funds and entrepreneurship
support).

Schneider Electric works to share this vision with its partners (see
pages 61-62), starting with its suppliers by encouraging as many of
them as possible to sign the United Nations Global Compact and
adopt the guidelines of ISO 26000.
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AT THE HEART OF OUR STRATEGY

1.1 Prioritizing actions with a materiality matrix

Materiality Analysis

In 2013, Schneider Electric conducted a materiality” analysis by
questioning relevant external stakeholders (F Hclients, media,
distributors, international organizations, experts, etc.), and top and
senior managers within the Group (Environment, Global Supply
Chain, Finance, Human Resources, Business, etc.). The
participants represented six different nationalities and 37% of the
respondents were women, 63% were men. Participants were
asked to assess the significance of each issue according to a
quantitative scoring scale, and then were interviewed for qualitative
evaluation and feedback about the process. With the help of
consulting firm Utopies, the aim is to ensure that Schneider Electric
reports against the most important economic, social and
environmental issues; identifies current and future opportunities
and risks for the business; and updates its sustainability agenda
with the key stakeholders’ expectations. In particular, the
materiality matrix was one of the sources used to design the
2015-2017 Planet & Society Barometer and confirm the topics to
be addressed in the 2014 registration document.

The publication of objectives and quarterly results is a way for
Schneider Electric to engage with its internal and external
stakeholders with regard to the objectives, to publicly disclose its
sustainable development challenges through the choice of
indicators, and to share progress made or difficulties encountered
in a transparent manner.

The Planet & Society Barometer is a tool that enables the Group to
anticipate and effectively manage its sustainability risks by
mobilizing key stakeholders around specific, measured objectives
and reliable results. The barometer’s indicators are audited
annually by an external auditor (limited assurance).

The Sustainable Development Department

The Sustainable Development Department, created in 2002, has
been part of the Strategy Department since 2008. It has the
following responsibilities:

z defining Schneider Electric’s sustainable development strategy
and rolling out action plans at the Group level with the
concerned entities;

z developing and managing Schneider Electric’s innovative
community projects to ensure continuing improvements in the
Group’s performance in this area.

In 2010, the Sustainable Development Department was adapted to
better meet the Company’s present and future challenges as well
as the requirements of its stakeholders. It is organized around four
areas:

N

ethics, steering the Responsibility & Ethics Dynamics program
(see pages 62-65);

social responsibility, specifically with the Schneider Electric
Foundation as well as local economic and social development
programs (see pages 95-100);

access to energy, with responsibility for the Access to Energy
program (see pages 91-95);

supporting and developing the Group’s performance, in
particular by steering the Planet & Society Barometer and the
strategy and sustainability report (see pages 46-47).

1.5 External and internal referentials for a solid framework

External referentials

The United Nations Global Compact

The Global Compact was launched in1999 by UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. It brings companies and
non-governmental organizations together under the aegis of the
United Nations to « unite the power of markets with the authority o'
universal ideals ».

>

Parties signing the Global Compact commit to 10 fundamental
principles in four areas: human rights, labor rights, the environment
and anti-corruption.

By signing the Global Compact in December 2002, Schneider
Electric made a public commitment to these universal values. The
Group has primarily worked to share this commitment with its
partners since 2008 (see page 61 « Relations with sub-contractors
and suppliers »).

In line with the requirements of the Global Compact, Schneider
Electric publishes an annual Communication on Progress (COP).
This publication reports on the Group’s different action plans and
monitoring indicators for the 10 principles of the Global Compact.
Schneider Electric meets the requirements of the Advanced Level
of the Global Compact with this report for COP.

ISO 26000

In 2010, the ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
published its guidelines on organizations’ social responsibility
(ISO standard 26000). ISO 26000 is a compromise that gets
different players from the public, private and non-profit sectors
from around 100 countries involved, and a vision of how an
organization should view societal responsibility. Schneider
Electric’s actions towards sustainable development are completely

in line with ISO 26000. This standard legitimizes the sustainable
development actions undertaken by the Group since the early
2000s and provides an educational support and framework for its
actions in the field. The Group has worked to promote the
adoption of the principles of ISO 26000 with its suppliers
since 2012 (see page 61 «Relations with sub-contractors and
suppliers »).

The Global Reporting Initiative

The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) was established in 1997 as a
mission to develop globally applicable directives to report on
economic, environmental and social performances; it was initially
intended for companies and subsequently for any governmental or
non-governmental organization.

Brought about by the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible
Economies (CERES) in association with the United Nations
Environmental Program (UNEP), the GRI integrates the active
participation of companies, NGOs, accounting bodies, business
associations and other stakeholders from across the globe.

Schneider Electric aligns its non-financial reporting with the
GRI and, until 2013, scored a B+ with respect to GRI 3.1. In 2014,
the Group began to align itself with GRI 4. A reference table with
these indicators and the indicators proposed by _ the
GRI is available on Schneider Electric website.

Internal referentials

The Group has written referentials that promote an_ ethical
framework and strategic roadmap in which the activities of

Schneider Electric are carried out: the 1S JOD JRGVATIQPOTJCIMJUZ

which are supplemented by guidelines and related policies.
Consequently, the Group’s desire to dynamically implement its

commitments gave rise to the Responsibility & Ethics Dynamics
program in 2010 (R&ED program).

=c>‘W\QWT@Sa‘|\aWPWZWbeg

As a global corporation, Schneider Electric continuously interacts
with local and international partners. The Group’s borders are
expanding, its environment is constantly changing, and its societal
responsibilities and activities are growing. In this international
context, reprehensible behavior may be seen when the ethics
inspection and prevention processes are fragile. The Group is
responsible for implementing its resources to support employees in
he event of an ethical dilemma.

OVI SJOD JIRGFHN P OT, HublishéWtar the first time in 2002

nternational Labour Organisation and the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development. The document is
available in 30 languages and is distributed to all employees.

ensure full compliance with the laws of all the countries in which
Schneider Electric is present;

z the code of ethics that all employees must follow in line with the
professional regulations of the Group;

z Group social responsibility - what all employees must do to act
responsibly towards society and the planet.

In 2010, the Responsibility & Ethics Dynamics program put these

ambitions into practice by setting up an organization, procedures

and tools for the Group, so that its employees could:

The evaluations by the leading sustainability ratings agencies and
by a number of ethical fund managers indicate the Company’s
performance in its sector. The evaluations and awards underline
external recognition of the Group’s sustainable development

The Group’s Human Resources policies cover the following:
diversity, employee engagement, recruiting, international mobility,
training, human capital development, talent identification, total
remuneration, social benefits and health and safety. These apply to
the Group and are accompanied by global processes.

Ethical stock market indices

A key performance indicator was set in the Planet & Society
Barometer for the duration of the 2012-2014 Connect program: to
ensure Schneider Electric's presence in the three major SRI
(Socially Responsible Investing) indices — the DJS! World, the DJSI
Europe, and since 2013, the CDP (CPLI index and/or CDLI) to
replace the ASPI, which is no longer published.
At the end of 2014, Schneider Electric is included in the three
ethical stock market indices covered by the barometer, its rating in
the CDP index is improving, and it has the highest rating in its
sector on the DJSI indices for the second year in a row.

Euronext Vigeo Indices

At the end of 2012, Euronext and Vigeo jointly launched a range of
indices singling out the exchange-listed companies that have the
best corporate social responsibility performances. The composition
of the indices is updated twice per year, in June and December,
based on the opinions of Vigeo conducted approximately every 18
months. As of December 1, 2012 Schneider Electric was selected
in three indices: Euronext Vigeo World 120, Euronext Vigeo Europe
120 and Euronext Vigeo France 20. Schneider Electric was
