@ Fortum Annual Report 2013

CEO's review

CEO’s review

In 2013, the economic recession in Europe and uncertainty over how long it would persist influenced energy

prices and demand. The downturn also slowed economic growth in Russia.

In the recent years, the inflow of heavily
subsidised renewable energy with grid priority
has changed the operating environment in
Europe significantly. Market-driven energy
production is struggling with weakened
profitability, reducing the ability of companies
to invest. Furthermore, the rapid growth in
distributed production poses big challenges
for market functionality and security of
supply.

Wholesale prices decreased as
consumer prices rose

The rapid entry of shale gas into the US
market has increased the use of gas,
improved the country’s energy self-
sufficiency and reduced the consumption of
coal. In the meanwhile, Europe has received a
steady stream of more economically priced
coal and its use has increased. This trend,
coupled with the rock-bottom prices of
emission allowances and more expensive gas
has eroded the profitability of energy
produced with natural gas in Europe. Brand-
new gas-fired power plants have been shut
down due to unprofitability. Despite the lower
wholesale prices, subsidies to renewable

energy have significantly hiked the
consumers' electricity bills.

Compared to coal-fired power generation,
natural gas-based power has a much lower
environmental impact. Power from natural
gas is also necessary for balancing the
fluctuation of renewable energy production in
areas where hydropower is unavailable. In
fact, discussions on the introduction of
capacity payments to support traditional
energy production have taken place in
several European countries during the year.
All the while, governments are already
spending considerable sums on subsidising
energy production.

Making carbon dioxide
emission reductions the
energy policy’s main goal

Debate on the direction of Europe’s energy
and climate policy remained lively throughout
2013. An increasingly topical issue was how
to maintain Europe’s competitiveness amidst
rising consumer prices.

66 An increasingly topical
issue in the debate on
the direction of Europe's
energy and climate
policy was how to
maintain
competitiveness amidst
rising consumer prices.

At the beginning of 2014, the European
Commission published its proposal on
Europe’s climate and energy policy for 2020
to 2030. The proposal placed a sharper focus
on reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
recommending a target of a 40 per cent
reduction in line with the commonly agreed
targets set by the EU for 2050.

The Commission also proposed getting rid of
the binding, national renewable energy
targets and setting a binding, EU-level target
to increase the share of renewable energy to
27 per cent. While this is a step in the right
direction, it still overlaps with the carbon

CEO's review

dioxide emissions reduction target.
Overlapping targets and steering mechanisms
increase the energy and climate policy price
tag and, ultimately, the consumers’ electricity
bill.

A positive development in the Commission’s
proposal was a market stability reserve
mechanism for emissions trading. The
mechanism may be useful in addressing the
central weakness of the emissions trading
scheme, which is its inability to cope with
strong fluctuations in demand or oversupply.
Advance agreement on the arrangements
controlling the scheme will reduce political
risk and improve the predictability required
for energy sector investments.

For Europe to remain competitive, it is
essential that efforts to create an integrated
electricity market continue. Shifting the
energy policy’s focus from national interests
to common energy production solutions that
leverage the region’s strengths will eventually
provide the most sustainable and cost-
effective results for consumers, industry and
the climate. In an integrated European
electricity market the use of production
capacity will be optimised and investment
signals market-driven.

Increased
speed and flexiblility in 2013

Despite a challenging operating environment,
2013 was a satisfactory year for Fortum.
Although our comparable operating profit
decreased, the operative cash flow was very
strong, and we continued to implement our
investment projects in Europe and Russia
with determination.

In 2012, we set a goal for Fortum’s efficiency
programme, which was to improve the
company’s speed and flexibility by
strengthening cash flow by at least one billion
euros in total by the end of 2014. The
programme has progressed as planned,
lightening our cost structure throughout our
operating areas. Furthermore, we have
divested non-core assets and improved our
working capital efficiency.

Towards emissions-free energy
production in line with the
strategy

Regardless of the economic recession, steps
must be taken to mitigate climate change.
The latest report by the Intergovernmental

Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sent a
strong scientific message to decision-makers:
Emissions must be clearly reduced before
2020 and must be cut in half by 2050. The
transition to a Solar Economy where energy
production is based on renewable energy
sources may be gradual, but it is inevitable.

The cornerstones of Fortum's strategy are
our strong expertise in CO2-free hydro and
nuclear power production, our efficient
combined heat and power (CHP) production,
and know-how in operating in the energy
markets. Alongside electricity production
based on renewable energy sources, our
strength, the energy-efficient CHP
production, flexibly responds to fluxuating
demand.

In 2013, we inaugurated five new production
facilities in Europe. New waste-fired CHP
plants were inaugurated in Klaipeda,
Lithuania, and Brista, Sweden, and new
biomass-fuelled CHP plants in Jelgava, Latvia,
and Jarvenpaa, Finland. Additionally, bio-oil
production using pyrolysis technology
commenced at Fortum’s Joensuu CHP plant.
This unique technology may offer significant
future business potential, for example, in the
area of traffic fuels. In fact, the Joensuu
project is the first of its kind in the world and
was recognised for innovation at the Global
District Energy Climate Awards in autumn
2013.

6 The transition to a Solar
Economy where energy
production is based on
renewable energy
sources may be gradual,
but it is inevitable.

In addition to increasing CHP capacity, we
also continued our annual hydropower
refurbishments and strengthened the
prerequisites for nuclear power production
particularly at our co-owned power plants in
Sweden. Fortum's fully-owned Loviisa nuclear
power plant in Finland had once again a good
production year. The plant’s load factor of
92.5% was excellent by international
standards. We have also established our
position in growth markets through our expert
services business during the year.

Fortum's Russian investment
programme progressed to the
final large units

In Russia, our investment programme is
progressing, and in 2013 two new power
plant units were commissioned in Nyagan, in
Western Siberia. Out of the programme's
eight production units, the three last, large
ones are under construction. Our new gas-
fired power plants in Russia are very energy-
efficient.

The weakened industrial and economic
growth indicators reported in Russia at the
end of the year indicate that not even this
market area is immune to the uncertainty in
the global economy. The Russian government
decided to postpone and reduce the
previously planned annual gas price increases
in its domestic markets. As a result, the new
and efficient plants will not have as
significant a competitive advantage as
previously estimated. Due to this
development and the weakened exchange
rate for the rouble, it will be more challenging
to achieve an operating profit level (EBIT) of
EUR 500 million run rate in 2015. However,
we will not abandon this target. Instead, we
will strive to actively develop our operations
and find ways to reach it.

Russia will be an important growth area for
Fortum in the upcoming years. The reform of
the Russian wholesale market has proceeded
completely according to plan, and we expect
the same consistent progress in the reform of
the heating sector as it gets underway.
Russia has the potential to significantly
increase the efficiency of its heat production,
a fact that offers interesting prospects for
Fortum’s heat business and CHP expertise.

Next generation solutions

Along with emissions-free hydro and nuclear
power and resource-efficient CHP production,
we are developing the use of waste and
biomass-based fuels as well as researching
opportunities in solar and wave power. These
are all building blocks of the future energy
system based on the sun's energy.

In India, we invested in a 5-megawatt solar
power plant in order to gain experience in
solar energy technologies and to enhance our
understanding of the country’s electricity
market. If the operating requisites develop
positively, | believe that in regions that are
favourable for production, unsubsidised solar

energy will be able to compete with other
energy sources even within this decade.

We are also continuously developing new
tools and services to help our business and
private customers monitor and lower their
energy consumption. A smart grid and
products that complement it, such as Fortum
Fiksu, play an increasingly important role in
the interaction between the energy producer
and the consumer. We are also developing
open, two-way solutions that enable
customers to sell the surplus electricity or
heat they produce to Fortum.

66 In 2013, we inaugurated
five new production
facilities in Europe.

Our concerted efforts to cater to the evolving
needs of our customer are also reflected in
our annual stakeholder satisfaction survey
results. For several consecutives years,
customers have indicated their increasing
satisfaction with Fortum and in 2013, the
survey results improved again. At the same
time, the number of customers we serve has
increased. At the end of 2013, Fortum had
more retail customers in the Nordic countries
than ever before.

Electricity distribution
business in Finland to be
divested

In December 2013, we completed the
assessment of future alternatives for our
electricity distribution business. After a
thorough analysis, we concluded that
divesting the electricity distribution business
is the best alternative for Fortum’s
shareholders and for the business itself. The
decision gives Fortum the opportunity to
focus on efficient and low-carbon electricity
and heat production as well as on its
activities in the integrating energy markets. It
also provides the company with strategic
freedom and increases shareholder value. |
firmly believe that it is also a good solution
from the perspective of our distribution
customers and society at large because it will
enable the development of the network
business purely from its own standpoint.

Accordingly, we signed an agreement to sell
the electricity distribution business in Finland
to Suomi Power Networks Oy in December.
Its shareholders are a consortium of the
Finnish pension funds Keva and LocalTapiola
Pension and the international infrastructure
investors First State Investments and Borealis
Infrastructure. We expect to finalise the sale
during the first quarter of 2014.

The decision has no effect on our electricity
retail customers to whom will continue to
offer smart products and services that
improve the efficiency of their energy
consumption and decrease their costs. Our
new products, like solar panels and heating
solutions that take advantage of the power
market's lowest hourly prices, have been well
received by customers. | am very pleased
with the continuous improvement in
customer satisfaction in all our divisions.
Fortum’s reputation among other key groups
also continued to strengthen.

Sustainability as an integral
part of strategy

Sustainability is a key success factor for
Fortum, and we are committed to the
principles of the UN Global Compact. We
adopted new sustainability indicators at the
beginning of 2013 and have met the
customer satisfaction and reputation targets
we set for them. However, because of the
heavy storms at the end of the year, we did
not reach our target with regard to the
security of supply for electricity. The average
outage time per customer was 220 minutes
during the entire year.

We will persist in our efforts to achieve our
environmental targets. Fortum gained
significant recognition for its work towards
emissions-free energy production and climate
change mitigation in autumn 2013 when the
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which
represents institutional investors, ranked us
as the best company in the Nordic Climate
Leadership Index with a maximum score of
one hundred points.

The occupational safety of Fortum’s own
personnel further improved in 2013 and the
number of injuries resulting in absences
reached an all-time low. On the other hand,
there is room for improvement in the
development of the occupational safety
culture of our contractors. In 2013, an

accident resulted in the death of a contractor
employee at our construction site in Russia
and in February 2014, an accident took the
life of a contractor employee working on our
distribution network in Sweden. | would like
to express my sincere condolences to the
families and colleagues of the victims. Our
goal is to avoid all serious accidents. For this
reason, improving occupational safety must
become integral to the daily routines of every
Fortum employee.

Ready to seize opportunities in
the changing energy markets

In difficult times it is good to be at the helm
of a company that can boldly shape its own
future. We will continue our efficiency
programme as planned, enhance our
flexibility, and decisively and systematically
build new business opportunities. Only a
company on stable financial footing such as
Fortum can leverage the opportunities
presented by the rapidly changing sector. We
will carefully manage our current business
and build the future in line with our strategy.

66 In difficult times it is
good to be at the helm of
a company that can
boldly shape its own
future.

To conclude, | extend my sincerest gratitude
to Fortum’s personnel in all our operating
countries for the work they have done
towards achieving our shared goals in the
past year. | also wish to acknowledge Sari
Baldauf, our Chairman of the Board, who for a
period of months assumed a greater
responsibility in advancing Fortum’s interests
while | was on sick leave. | also thank our
CFO Markus Rauramo, who successfully
served as my deputy. And, finally, | would like
to thank our customers and our broadening
shareholder roster for your trust. We will
continue to work to increase the company’s
value also in 2014.

Strategy

Future energy system - Solar Economy

Fortum believes that the future energy system will be based on emissionsfree and inexhaustible energy sources
and on overall efficiency of the energy system.

The transition towards Solar Economy brings
changes to the way energy is produced and
consumed.

In conventional energy production, the
combustion of fuels, like coal and

gas, provides the main source of energy.
Coal, in particular, burdens the environment
and has poor total efficiency. With the rapid
growth in the global demand for energy and
in the consumption of electricity, mitigating
climate change is becoming an increasingly
important issue. Energy systems and the use

Changes in the energy system are slow to
implement. Transitioning from the current
energy system to a Solar Economy requires
technology advancements as well as changes
in the energy markets, the political
environment, and society's infrastructure and

Large CO,emissions

of limited natural resources must be made
more efficient.

Solar Economy provides solutions to the
challenges of climate change and resource
scarcity. In Solar Economy, energy from the
sun is used either directly as solar electricity
and heat or indirectly as hydro, ocean, wind
and bioenergy. On the journey towards Solar
Economy, traditional production forms will be
further developed and used alongside solar-
based production.

happen over the course of several decades.
Development of the operating environment is
necessary for the investments required for a
change in the energy system, while the length
of the transition period and the cost are
dependent on political decisions, society's
priorities and technology advancements in
production forms.

Inexhaustible fuel resources

In Solar Economy, the energy system is more
dynamic and smarter, enabling both
centralised and distributed electricity
production. Active participation by electricity
users brings elasticity to demand, which
improves the efficiency of the system.

SOLAR ECONOMY . J

Emissions-free production

Fortum wants to promote both short- and
long-term development of the energy system
simultaneously. However, the current
emission-free energy sources are not yet able
to fulfil the energy demand of today's rapidly
developing society. That is why in the short
term we are continuing to widely utilise also
traditional energy forms, albeit with

the goal to do so even more efficiently.

@ Fortum Annual Report 2013

Strategy

Core areas of the strategy

The core of our strategy is our strong expertise in COzfree hydro and nuclear power and in efficient combined

heat and power production. Our strengths also include solid experience operating in the energy markets. Our
business focus areas will continue to be developed through these competencies.

Build on the strong Nordic core

Hydro and nuclear power have a significant
role in Fortum's production portfolio. Both
are CO-free production forms and
competitive with regard to variable costs. In
2013, about 85% of Fortum's European
electricity production was based on hydro
and nuclear power located in the Nordic
countries.

Hydro power is particularly valuable in the
integrating European energy market, where it
can be used to balance out consumption
peaks and the production fluctuations of
growing wind and solar power.

Combined heat and power (CHP) production
has a central role in our business throughout
the Baltic region. Electricity produced in
conjunction with district heat enables the use
of bio- and waste fuels, and it is a more
energy-efficient way to use traditional fossil
fuels.

In 2013, Fortum assessed the future
alternatives of its electricity distribution
business. After thorough consideration, the
company has concluded that divesting the
electricity distribution business is the best
solution for the business and its customers,

Fortum's shareholders and the company's
other businesses. Focusing on electricity and
heat production and sales, is estimated to
improve Fortum's long-term value

creation. Fortum has electricity distribution
business in Finland, Sweden and Norway. The
assessment has no impact on Fortum's
electricity retail customers. Fortum will
continue to develop its electricity sales
business as an integral part of the company's
strategy and will continue offering innovative
products and services to its approximately
1.2 million electricity retail customers in the
Nordic countries also in the future.

Create solid earnings growth
in Russia

Russia is the fourth biggest consumer of
electricity globally and the growth of its
electricity demand is outpacing that of the
EU's. Fortum's investment programme is
bringing new energy-efficient production units
on stream; these are expected to significantly
increase the share of sales and profits that
Fortum earns from its Russian operations and
will diversify Fortum's production portfolio
geographically. Completing the investment
programme is a key priority for us.

Fortum's production in Russia consists mainly
of combined heat and power production. For
the time being, the heating market in Russia
is completely regulated and does not work
effectively nor encourage the necessary
investments in the sector. However, heating
reform is being drafted in Russia. If realised,
it would offer significant possibilities of value
creation for Fortum.

Build a platform for future
growth

Alongside our current business operations,
we are pursuing precisely targeted new
growth and developing future energy
solutions. We are developing the solar power
business through centralised large-scale
production, commercial applications and
distributed household applications.

Additionally, our research and development
activities support the advancement towards a
carbon dioxide-free future by promoting the
adoption of new technologies, which could
offer significant business opportunities in the
future. Examples include wave power, new
CHP concepts, and new solutions for
customers.

@ Fortum Annual Report 2013

Market development in recent years has pushed Europe’s electricity sector into turmoil. Since 2010, the players
in the sector have lost an average of about one fifth of their market value, and the companies focusing solely
on power generation have lost even more.

Driving the change has been the weakened
industrial demand for electricity caused by
the economic downturn, the strong increase
in subsidised renewable energy that has
replaced market-driven production, and the
increased uncertainty and inconsistency in
energy policy regulation both at the national
and EU level. The market price of electricity
has decreased, and energy companies are
struggling to manage the debt burdens
stemming from capital-intensive investments.
And the influx of shale gas into the market
has weakened the competitive position of
European industry, particularly compared to
that of the United States.

The turmoil continued in the energy sector in
2013, and the state of the European
economy did not ease the situation for
companies in the sector. Economic growth
estimates were further lowered, which in turn
has reflected on electricity demand estimates
in Europe and in Russia. The growth outlook
in the sector is generally flat and, for
example, Fortum’s estimate on annual growth
of electricity consumption in the Nordic
countries has hovered around the 0.5% level
for a long time.

66 The turmoil continued in
the energy sector in
2013, and the state of
the European economy
didn’t ease the situation
for companies in the
sector.

sources was strong in Europe in 2013, in line
with policy targets set for renewable energy.
Overall, energy market development moved
towards national and more regulated
solutions rather than European and market-
driven solutions. Against this background, it
was not a surprise that the structural reform
of the emissions trading scheme and
renewable energy support schemes were
actively debated. The Commission gave its
proposal on reforming the emissions trading
scheme in January 2014, but the related
decisions will be deferred to the term of the
new Commission and Parliament. At the
same time, the Commission is in a process to
revise the State aid guidelines for energy and
the environment advocating more market-
oriented and harmonised subsidies for
renewable energy sources in order to improve
their efficiency and save cost.

European market development

Electricity production from renewable energy
sources increased strongly in 2013. The
development is in line with EU climate and
energy policy targets. Most of these
production forms, however, rely on subsidies
and require regulating power capacity to
balance production fluctuations and to
secure energy supply in situations when e.g.
wind or solar energy is not available.

Subsidy mechanisms that were designed on a
national basis and, in some cases, are
oversized, have proved to be
counterproductive to the functioning of
European electricity market and emissions
trading. In addition to a growing tax burden,
they have led to an increase in the end-users’
energy bill - even though the wholesale
market price of electricity has decreased.
Meanwhile, the competitiveness of market-
driven, unsubsidised production has
weakened, and very few, if any, investments
decisions based on the wholesale market
price are being made.

The situation has sparked a discussion on the
need to reassess renewable energy support
schemes and to develop the EU electricity
market model so that it better rewards
flexible power and reserve power through
capacity mechanisms. Renewable generation
energy costs for member states are expected
to rise to a total of 330 billion euros by 2020;
this is an economic burden for member
states and the entire EU, and it weakens
competitiveness.

In November 2013, the European
Commission published the first extensive
guidance that aims to help member states to
choose support mechanisms that are least
detrimental to the functioning and
development of the EU energy market. The
guidelines focus on renewable energy support
schemes and capacity mechanisms and on
the possibilities to utilise elasticity of
demand. Building on these non-binding
guidelines, the European Commission will
adopt legally binding EU’s guidelines for State
aid for the energy sector in 2014.

66 The situation has
sparked a discussion on
the need to reassess
renewable energy
support schemes and to
develop the EU
electricity market model.

Balanced development of the EU energy
market requires renewable energy support
schemes and capacity mechanisms to be
megawatt-neutral, i.e. they must give equal
treatment to the different production forms
and to production capacities of varying ages.
As the need for flexible energy production
grows, it is essential to change the current
market model so that flexibility of energy

production would also be better rewarded
than it is today.

Price development of
electricity and emission
allowances

While market development has not been
totally satisfactory at the EU level, the
situation in the Nordic countries is better.
The Nordic wholesale market has developed
further, and in June 2013 Latvia became the
last Baltic country to join the Nord

Pool power exchange. Because of the
exceptionally good hydrological situation in
2012, area price differences between Finland
and Sweden were big. In 2013 the prices
became more aligned.

The average system spot price of electricity
in 2013 was 38.1 (31.2) euros per megawatt-
hour. The average area price in Finland was
41.2 (36.6) euros per megawatt-hour and in

Renewable energy form

Renewable energy refers to energy pro-
duced from renewable energy sources
from ongoing natural processes. With
the exception of geothermal and tidal
energy, renewable energy sources get
their energy from the sun. Renewable
energy, excluding bioenergy, generates
zero carbon dioxide emissions, and that
is why it plays a key role in mitigating
climate change. Under today’s rules, the
use of bioenergy is considered climate
neutral.

The European Union defines wind and
solar power, aerothermal and geother-

mal energy, hydro power, biomass, and
gas and biogas generated at landfills
and wastewater treatment plants as
renewable energy.

The Renewable Energy Sources (RES)
Directive of the European Parliament
and of the Council on promoting the
use of energy from renewable sour-

ces defines the sustainability criteria
for biofuels and other bioliquids. The
Commission has for several years con-
sidered the need of having similar sus-
tainability criteria also for solid biomass
with an aim to ensure the sustainability

of all biomasses used for energy in the
EU as as promote the development
of a functioning biomass market. It has
nevertheless decided not to make such
a proposal so far.

Renewable energy must be promoted in a market-driven manner

The target of current EU legislation is to
increase the share of renewable energy to
20% of energy consumption by 2020. The
EU's binding target has been divided into
member state-specific targets.

In January 2014, the Commission pre-
sented EU climate and energy targets

for 2030. The Commission is proposing
a binding CO, reduction target of 40
accompanied by a binding EU-level target
of 27% for renewable energy instead of
national targets. Achieving the current
nationally binding renewable energy
targets has required significant financial

Europe needs major
investments in production
plants and transmission
infrastructure

European energy production plants are aging.
Despite regional overproduction of renewable
energy, significant investments must be made
in low-carbon production over the next
decade in Europe in order to achieve the
tightened legislative requirements and the EU
emissions targets for 2050. It is estimated
that investments of about 5-7 trillion, i.e.
5,000-7,000 billion euros, in electricity
generation capacity are needed in Europe by
2050. Implementing the investments requires
a supporting market model and reasonable
return potential from wholesale markets.

Europe’s energy infrastructure development
has not kept pace with increasing renewable

support for renewable energy forms in
most countries. Member states have been
able to decide on their own subsidy sche-
mes, and therefore the national subsidies
differ significantly from one another. This
has led to a subsidy race and investments
that are not cost effective.

The tax burden is also increasing, both on
production and consumption of energy.
Several countries put the tax burden on
non-emitting technologies like hydro and
nuclear. Such taxes are in direct conflict
with the generally accepted energy and
climate policy targets and increase the

energy production. The permit processes
required to build transnational power lines
have become the most significant bottleneck.
In 2013, the EU adopted a new energy
infrastructure regulation that was linked to a
special financing instrument. This is expected
to advance the construction of priority
transmission networks by accelerating permit
processes and offering additional funding.

uncertainty in the energy sector.

The European energy industry believes
there should be a shift from the diffe-
rent types of national renewable energy
subsidies, which are not cost-effective for
society, to a market-driven scheme where
the use of renewable energy is promoted
through climate targets and an efficiently
functioning carbon market. For sectors
remaining outside the emissions trading,
targets for renewable energy might be
needed also in the future.

Market reform approaching in Russia

Enforcement of heat production legislation,
which took effect at the beginning of 2011, is
continuing in Russia. Meanwhile, the
elimination of cross-subsidies has been
advanced between electricity and heat
production as well as between residential and
big industrial customers. The country has also
taken into use long-term heat tariffs, but, as
with the legislation on heat production, their
implementation is still unfinished.

Modernisation of the heat sector in Russia is
vitally important, as it would be very difficult
to achieve the national targets for energy
efficiency without it. As the first step, a
change from cost plus-pricing of heat to
pricing based on alternative forms of heating
is under consideration. This would encourage
investments in improved efficiency and
especially in combined heat and power (CHP)
production.

66 Modernisation of the
heat sector in Russia is
vitally important.

In 2013, the Ministry of Energy stated that a
heat reform should be developed before
changing the current electricity and capacity
market model. Therefore, at the end of the
year, the Ministry of Energy proposed a new
heat market model (for public discussion),
which is supposed to ensure the transition to
economically justified heat tariffs by 2020
and to attract investments into the heat
sector. The new regulation concept is at an
early stage and is expected to be further
developed during 2014.

Quarterly reviews for gas
prices

Since the beginning of 2013, wholesale gas
prices (except for private household and
industrial consumers) have been reviewed
quarterly. In February 2013, the Board of
Russia's Federal Tariff Service (FTS) adopted
a decision according to which the wholesale
gas price for industrial consumers decreased
by 3% as of the second quarter 2013,
compared to first quarter.

As of 1 July 2013, the Russian Government
increased gas prices by 15% compared to

June 2013. Further increases were done in
August and October in order to reach the
planned total increase of approximately 15%
in 2013 compared to 2012. According to a
forecast made by the Russian Ministry of
Economic Development, Russian gas price
indexation will not take place as of July 2014.
However, year-on-year gas price growth is
estimated to be 7.6% in 2014.

In 2013, 1,026 (1,037) terawatt-hours of
electricity was used in Russia. The
corresponding figure in Fortum’s operating
area, in the First price zone, was 767 (769)
terawatt-hours.

In January-December 2013, the average

Market Development

Carbon market development

Substantial oversupply and low price levels characterised the EU market for emission allowances in 2013. The
scheme is in urgent need of reform in order to give the market the right price signal that encourages

investments in low-carbon production.

New knowledge about climate
change

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) published its latest
assessment report on climate change in
September 2013. The report takes a more
serious tone than before in describing the
advancement of climate change - limiting the
increase in the global average temperature to
two degrees is extremely challenging and, at
worst, the increase can be as high as five
degrees. As a new issue, the IPCC addresses
the significance of oceans on climate change;
the bulk of the heat increase is stored
specifically in oceans.

In 2013, the carbon dioxide concentration in
the atmosphere surpassed 400 parts per
million (ppm) for the first time in human
history. The IPCC also determined the carbon
emissions limit that, if exceeded, would lead
to atmospheric warming of more than two
degrees. The IPCC noted that at the current
pace the global carbon emissions quota will
be reached in 30 years, and called for quick
actions to curb emissions.

66 To improve the
functionality of the
emissions trading
scheme, the EU must set
an ambitious
reduction target for
greenhouse gas
emissions only.

The UN’s international climate negotiations
advanced with weak results in 2013. The goal
is for a universal climate agreement by 2015.
Development of an international carbon
market advanced only in some respects.
Several emissions trading pilot projects were
launched in China, and regional schemes
were expanded in North America. Australia
decided to repeal the previously agreed

emissions trading legislation, and thus its
earlier agreed link with the EU’s emissions
trading scheme remains unrealised for now.
Japan also announced that it will significantly
lower its own emissions reduction target.

Climate targets must be
clarified quickly

The EU has committed to an 80-95%
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by
2050. The European energy industry has
committed to the challenging emissions
target, but the regulatory uncertainty
significantly hampers the investments and
emissions reduction measures required to
achieve the target. Climate policy must be
long-term and predictable for energy sector
investments. By committing to one target -
the ambitious reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions by 2030 - overlapping regulations
and controls could be dismantled and
uncertainty could be significantly reduced.

Market-driven solutions, like emissions
trading, must be prioritised to minimise the
costs incurred by reducing emissions.
Emissions trading improves the
competitiveness of low-carbon production
methods and enables climate targets to be
achieved at the lowest possible cost.

The EU is currently defining the energy and
climate policy framework and targets for
2030. The Commission’s proposal for 2030
target-setting was received in January 2014,
and the aim is to decide on the targets during
spring 2014. The Commission proposes a
40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The
proposal also includes a binding EU-level
target to increase the share of renewable
energy sources to 27% by 2030.

Emissions trading scheme
must be reformed

The economic recession and overlapping
climate policy steering mechanisms in the EU
have led to reduced demand for emission

allowances and lower prices, which hovered
around 4-5 euros for most of 2013, although
the price did fluctuate considerably from 2.5
euros to nearly 7 euros. A very low emission
allowance price does not encourage low-
carbon investments, and thus creates a risk
that new production capacity to be built will
generate emissions far into the future.

After long negotiations in the EU and the
resulting decision to postpone the auctioning
of 900 million allowances (backloading), the
end of the year saw a slight recovery in the
carbon market from the low in spring 2013.
The backloading to be implemented during
2014 is the first measure to reform the
emissions trading scheme. The goal is to
restore confidence in the emissions trading
scheme and to give the market a price signal
that encourages investments in low-carbon
production methods.

Structural reform of the emissions trading
scheme was actively debated. The
Commission gave its proposal on reforming
the scheme in January 2014, but the related
decisions will be deferred to the term of the
new Commission and Parliament. The
Commission is proposing the adoption of a
market stability reserve starting in 2021; the
mechanism sparked wide interest already in
2013. Fortum proposed an allowance supply
adjustment mechanism in July 2013 and
actively lobbied for the method with various
stakeholders.

During the year, real concern emerged about
the impact of climate change mitigation on
the competitiveness of Europe and energy-
intensive industries in particular. Emissions
must be reduced cost-efficiently, e.g. with a
functioning carbon market; consequently,
climate change mitigation costs and the
impact on energy prices will remain lower
than with other climate policy control
mechanisms.

In 2013, electricity consumption in the
Nordic countries was slightly lower than last
year at 386 terawatt-hours (TWh), even
though non-industrial consumption partly
offset the decrease in industrial demand
especially during the first half of the year. In
Russia, in the areas where Fortum operates,
consumption was flat at 767 TWh.

The Nordic hydro reservoirs were below the
long-term average and although the levels
normalised towards the end of the year, they
were still clearly lower than last year’s record-
high levels. Precipitation was weak in
Fortum’s operating areas during the first
three quarters of the year; this put pressure

on hydro volumes and thus impacted
Fortum's results negatively.

The comparable profit declined compared to
the previous year and totalled approximately
EUR 1.6 billion, and earnings per share were
EUR 1.36. The cash flow from operating
activities, however, was strong with all
divisions contributing. We made good
progress in sustainability and safety in 2013.
Fortum received a special award for
innovation from the Global District Energy
Climate Awards organisation and was ranked
as the best company in the Nordic climate
index. We had our lowest-ever total
recordable incidents (TRIF) among our own
personnel.

In December 2013, Fortum completed the
strategic assessment of its electricity
distribution business. The conclusion was
that divesting the electricity distribution
business is the best solution in order to
further develop our company according to its
strategy. We also consider it to be the best
solution for the distribution business itself
and for its customers. Focusing on electricity
and heat production and sales, is estimated
to give Fortum more strategic flexibility and
to improve the company's long-term value
creation.

In line with the conclusions of the completed
assessment, Fortum agreed to sell its
electricity distribution business in Finland to

Operating and financial review

Suomi Power Networks Oy. The business is in
very good shape and deserves to be
developed further as a core business from its
own standpoint. The buyer has a deep
understanding of the social importance of
infrastructure assets and is committed to
developing reliable networks and services for
the customers. We expect to close the deal
during the first quarter of 2014; until then,
work continues as usual in all business areas.
Fortum is also evaluating the possible future
divestment opportunities within the electricity
distribution business country by country.

In 2014, we will continue our everyday work
in serving our customers in all areas of our
business. The year-end storms in Finland,
Sweden and Norway tested once again our
ability to serve customers in challenging
conditions. We have continuously improved
the reliability of our networks. The same
trend can be seen also in the results of the
recent customer satisfaction survey: Fortum
improved its ranking in electricity sales,
distribution and as a supplier of district heat.

2013 was a year of inaugurations at Fortum.
In Jelgava, Latvia, and in Jarvenpaa, Finland,
we commissioned new biomass-fired CHP
plants. In Klaipeda, Lithuania, we took into
production a waste-to-energy CHP plant,
while in Brista, Sweden, test-runs were
started. Fortum also commissioned the
world's first bio-oil production facility that is
integrated with a combined heat and power
(CHP) plant in Joensuu, Finland. In Russia, the
gas-fired thermal power plant Nyagan GRES
was inaugurated by President of Russia
Vladimir Putin and President of Finland Sauli
Niinisté. Units 1 and 2 are now
commissioned, and both are receiving
capacity payments. We will continue the
determined implementation of our investment
programme with three large units still under
construction. Both with existing and with new
power plants, we continue to build Fortum's
future growth.

The on-going company-wide efficiency
programme continued to proceed according
to plan, and we are approximately half way
through. The work will continue; we are
continuously working on reducing fixed costs
and capital expenditures, divesting non-core
business and focusing on working capital
efficiency.

Looking at the operating environment for
Fortum overall, it’s clear that the markets will
remain challenging also in 2014. Only
through our own actions can we ensure that
the premises for success are in place.

Changes to the EU energy and climate policy
are likely to be seen in 2014. It is crucial that
determined measures to mitigate climate
change are continued. However, in order to
safeguard the competiveness of European
industries and get the much needed
investments into low-carbon energy
production and infrastructure, the EU climate
policy should be steered by a single COz
reduction target post-2020, and the existing
overlapping steering mechanisms should be
removed. In January, the European
Commission published a new proposal for the
EU's climate policy and energy policy - the
proposal is a step in the right direction, but
overlapping targets remain.

Regarding the tax climate, the governments
in Finland and Sweden have made positive
and material decisions on lowering the
corporate tax rates to stimulate businesses;
beyond that, the overall tax climate has
tightened considerably. Fortum has appealed
several cases raised by the tax authorities
that have been addressed retroactively and
also some cases that have already been
scrutinised.

In Finland, the power plant tax (previously
called the windfall tax) has been adopted as
of 2014. It will be applied provided that the
European Commission finds that it is in line
with the general tax principles and regime in
Finland and that it does not include forbidden
state aid. The Swedish hydro real-estate tax
is also being challenged.

We are pursuing growth, carefully considering
and prioritising alternatives in line with our
strategy. We consider Fortum to be well
positioned among its peers and ready to grab
emerging opportunities that are a good fit
with our strategy focus on low-carbon power
generation, energy-efficient combined heat
and power (CHP) production and sales, and
innovative customer offerings. Concentrating
on electricity and heat production and sales
is estimated to improve Fortum's long-term
value creation.

To summarise, 2013 was a year full of activity
as well as challenges; nevertheless, the result
was satisfactory. The dividend proposal
reflects Fortum's dividend policy to pay a
stable, sustainable and over time increasing
dividend that supports shareholder value and
the company's strategy.

Efficiency programme 2013-2014

Fortum started an efficiency programme in
2012 in order to maintain and strengthen its
strategic flexibility and competitiveness and
to enable the company to reach its financial
targets in the future.

The aim is to improve the company’s cash
flow by more than approximately EUR 1
billion during 2013-2014 by reducing capital
expenditures (capex) by EUR 250-350
million, divesting approximately EUR 500
million of non-core assets, reducing fixed

costs and focusing on working capital
efficiency.

Capex in 2014 is expected to be EUR
0.9-1.1 billion excluding Varme. At the end
of 2014, the cost run-rate is targeted to be
approximately EUR 150 million lower
compared to 2012, including growth
projects.

If headcount reductions are needed, Fortum
seeks to limit redundancies whenever

possible. The assessments will therefore be
done at a unit level.

At the end of December 2013, Fortum had
divested approximately EUR 300 million in
non-core assets since the start of the
efficiency programme. The company has
been able to decrease its cost run-rate by
approximately half of the targeted EUR 150
million and working capital efficiency has
been improved.

Assessment of the electricity distribution

business

In December, Fortum completed the
assessment of the future alternatives of its
electricity distribution business; the
assessment was launched in January 2013.
After thorough consideration, the company
concluded that divesting the electricity
distribution business is the best solution for
the business and its customers, Fortum's
shareholders and the company's other
businesses. During the assessment process
all alternatives were carefully studied in order
to find the best solution. Fortum is evaluating
the remaining possible future divestment
opportunities country by country. The
outcome is dependent on market
development and on development of national
regulation in the countries of operation.

Also in December, as the first phase, Fortum
agreed to sell its electricity distribution
business in Finland to Suomi Power Networks
Oy, which is owned by a consortium of
Finnish pension funds Keva (12.5%) and
LocalTapiola Pension (7.5%) together with
international infrastructure investors First
State Investments (40%) and Borealis
Infrastructure (40%). The total consideration
is EUR 2.55 billion on a debt- and cash-free
basis. Fortum expects to complete the
divestment process during the first quarter of
2014, subject to the necessary regulatory
approvals as well as customary closing
conditions. Fortum expects to book a one-
time sales gain of EUR 1.8-1.9 billion,
corresponding to approximately EUR 2.0 per
share, in its Electricity Solutions and

Distribution Division's first-quarter 2014
results.

A total of 340 employees will transfer with
the business at closing with existing terms of
employment. The sale has no effect as such
on Fortum's approximately 640,000
distribution customers. Upon closing, those
customers will transfer with the business with
existing terms.

held for sale.

Market conditions

Nordic countries

In 2013, according to preliminary statistics,
electricity consumption in the Nordic
countries was 386 TWh (2012: 391).

At the beginning of the year, the Nordic water
reservoirs were at 85 TWh, i.e. 2 TWh above
the long-term average. At the end of the year,
the reservoirs were at 82 TWh, which is 1
TWh below the long-term average and 3 TWh
below the corresponding level in 2012. Heavy
precipitation, mild weather and moderate
consumption led to rapid normalisation of
reservoirs.

In 2013, the average system spot price was

EUR 38.1 per MWh (2012: 31.2). In Finland,
the average area price was EUR 41.2 per

Power consumption

MWh (2012: 36.6) and in Sweden (SE3) EUR
39.4 per MWh (2012: 32.3).

In Germany, the average spot price during
2013 was EUR 37.8 per MWh (2012: 42.6).

The market price of CO2 emission allowances
(EUA) dropped from approximately EUR 6.6
per tonne at the beginning of the year to
approximately EUR 5.0 per tonne at the
beginning of the fourth quarter, to which it
also returned by the year-end. During 2013,
EUA traded between EUR 2.8 and EUR 6.7
per tonne.

Russia

Fortum operates in the Urals and Western
Siberia. Both in the Tyumen and Khanty-

Mansiysk area, where industrial production is
dominated by the oil and gas industries, and
in the Chelyabinsk area, which is dominated
by the metal industry, electricity demand
declined somewhat for the full year 2013
compared to previous year.

In 2013, Russia consumed 1,026 TWh (2012:
1,037) of electricity. The corresponding figure
in Fortum’s operating area in the First price
zone (European and Urals part of Russia) was
767 TWh (2012: 769).

In 2013, the average electricity spot price,
excluding capacity price, increased by 10% to
RUB 1,104 per MWh (2012: 1,001) in the
First price zone.

European business
environment and carbon
market

In January, the European Commission
published its proposal for the EU’s climate
and energy policy for 2020-2030. As a part of
the proposal the Commission put forward an
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030,
which is in line with the political target to
reduce emissions by 80.95% by 2050. It is
positive that in the 2030 framework the main
focus is now more clearly on reducing
greenhouse gases. In addition, a new stability
mechanism for emissions trading was
proposed.

3 a

Contrary to the current policy, only an EU-
level target is proposed for renewable energy.
This is a step in the right direction, although
this EU-level target is binding and therefore
creates some overlapping with the
greenhouse gas emissions reduction target.

Fortum's view is that an energy and climate
framework based on one single binding target
for CO2 and a non-binding target for
renewables in 2030 would be a more cost-
efficient solution to tackle climate change
without compromising Europe's industrial
competitiveness.

Fortum supports a technology-neutral
approach both regarding climate policy and
renewable energy, and the target for
renewable energy (RES) should concentrate
on promotion of research & development,

innovations and demonstration, not on
production. It is also important to integrate
renewable electricity fully into the electricity
market, as its amount and share will grow in
the future. Increasing the share of renewable
energy in the EU energy mix is a positive and
desired development.

The EU carbon market was characterised by
a significant surplus of allowances and
therefore a low market price in 2013. The
revision of the European emissions trading
scheme (EU ETS) was actively debated
throughout the year. After a lengthy process,
in late 2013 and early 2014, the amendment
of the emissions trading directive and
changes to the auctioning regulation enabling
the backloading of allowances from
2014-2016 to 2019-2020 were approved.
The backloading concerns a total of 900
million allowances and is not expected to
substantially increase the price. Backloading
is expected to be implemented during the
first half of 2014 and is the first step in the
revision of the ETS. This revision aims at
restoring confidence in the system and giving
a price signal that encourages investments in
low-carbon production methods.

The Commission released a proposal on the
structural reform of the European Trading
system (ETS) in January 2014. The proposal
includes a market stability reserve, where the
supply-demand balance is automatically
managed by pre-defined rules from 2021
onwards. The proposal will be processed
further by the new Commission and the
Parliament.

In 2013, Group sales were EUR 6,056 million
(2012: 6,159). Comparable operating profit
totalled EUR 1,607 million (2012: 1,752) and
the reported operating profit totalled EUR
1,712 million (2012: 1,874). Fortum's
operating profit for the period was affected
by non-recurring items, an IFRS accounting
treatment (IAS 39) of derivatives mainly used
for hedging Fortum's power production, and
nuclear fund adjustments amounting to EUR
105 million (2012: 122).

The share of profits of associates and joint
ventures was EUR 105 million (2012: 23).
The increase comes mainly from Hafslund
and TGC-1. The share of profits from
Hafslund and TGC-1 are based on the
companies’ published fourth-quarter 2012 as
well as first-, second- and third-quarter 2013
interim reports.

The Group’s net financial expenses were EUR
318 million (2012: 311). Net financial
expenses included changes in the fair value
of financial instruments of EUR 16 million
(2012: 23).

Profit before taxes was EUR 1,499 million
(2012: 1,586).

Taxes for the period totalled EUR 220 million
(2012: 74). The tax rate according to the
income statement was 14.7% (2012: 4.7%). In

Finland, the corporate tax rate was
decreased to 20.0% from 24.5% starting 1
January 2014. The tax rate change caused a
one-time effect in 2013 of approximately EUR
0.09 per share. In Sweden, the corporate tax
rate was decreased to 22.0% from 26.3%
starting 1 January 2013. In 2012, the one-
time positive effect from the tax rate change
was approximately EUR 230 million, of which
EUR 34 million is attributable to non-
controlling interests. The tax rate, excluding
the changes in the tax rates, the impact of
the share of profits of associated companies
and joint ventures as well as non-taxable
capital gains was 22.3% (2012: 21.2%).

The profit for the period was EUR 1,279
million (2012: 1,512). Fortum's earnings per
share were EUR 1.36 (2012: 1.59), of which
EUR 0.10 per share (2012: 0.14) relates to
items affecting comparability and EUR 0.09
per share to the change in Finnish corporate
tax rate. In 2012, the impact of the lowered
Swedish corporate tax rate was
approximately EUR 0.22 per share.

Non-controlling (minority) interests amounted
to EUR 75 million (2012: 96). These are
mainly attributable to AB Fortum Varme
Holding, in which the city of Stockholm has a
50% economic interest.

Cash flow

In 2013, total net cash from operating
activities increased by EUR 454 million to
EUR 1,836 million (2012: 1,382), mainly due
to a decrease in working capital of EUR 296
million and realised foreign exchange
differences turning to positive EUR 320
million which were offset with a lower
EBITDA. Capital expenditures decreased by
EUR 151 million to EUR 1,271 million (2012:
1,422). Proceeds from divestments totalled
EUR 210 million (2012: 433). Total net cash
used in investing activities was EUR -1,210
million (201 2: -1,128). Cash flow before
financing activities, i.e. dividend distributions
and financing, increased by EUR 372 million
to EUR 626 million (2012: 254). Realised
foreign exchange gains and losses of EUR 52
million (2012: -268) were related to the
rollover of foreign exchange contract hedging
loans to Fortum's Swedish and Russian
subsidiaries.

Dividends totalling EUR 888 million were paid
on 19 April 2013 using cash and cash
equivalents.

Assets and capital employed

Total assets decreased by EUR 141 million to
EUR 24,420 million (24,561 at year-end
2012). The net change in total assets was
negative, even though capital expenditures

and gross investments in shares (EUR 1,299
million) were higher than depreciation during
the year (EUR 740 million). The total impact
of translation differences on intangible
assets, property plant and equipment as well
as participations in associates and joint
ventures was negative EUR 861 million. Cash
and cash equivalents increased by EUR 291
million.

Presenting the Finnish distribution business
as assets held for sale impacted the structure
of the balance sheet, because all assets and
liabilities belonging to those operations were
presented separately on one line both in
assets and liabilities.

For further information, see Note 9 Assets
held for sale.

Capital employed was EUR 19,780 (19,420 at
year-end 2012) million, an increase of EUR
360 million. The increase was due to the
lower amount of total assets, EUR 141
million, and a EUR 501 million decrease in
interest-free liabilities.

Equity

Total equity was EUR 10,662 (10,643 at year-
end 2012) million, of which equity
attributable to owners of the parent company
totalled EUR 10,024 million (2012: 10,040)
and non-controlling interests EUR 638 million
(2012: 603).

@ Fortum Annual Report 2013

Operating and financial review

The decrease in equity attributable to owners
of the parent company totalled EUR 16
million and is mainly arising from the payment
of dividends totalling EUR -888 million, net
profit of EUR 1,204 million for the period and
translation differences of EUR -471 million.

Financing

Net debt increased during 2013 by EUR 35
million to EUR 7,849 (7,814 at year-end
2012) million.

During 2013 Fortum Corporation issued new
long term debt in SEK and EUR amounting to
approximately EUR 760 million.

At the end of December 2013, the Group’s
liquid funds totalled EUR 1,269 million (963
at year-end 2012). Liquid funds include cash
and bank deposits held by OAO Fortum

amounting to EUR 113 million (128 at year-
end 2012). In addition to the liquid funds,
Fortum had access to approximately EUR 2.2
billion of undrawn committed credit facilities.

The Group's net financial expenses during
2013 were EUR 318 million (2012: 311). Net
financial expenses include changes in the fair
value of financial instruments of EUR -16
million (2012: -23).

Fortum Corporation's long-term credit rating
with S&P was reaffirmed at A- (negative
outlook) in December 2013. As of April 2013,
Fitch Ratings provides a rating of Fortum

In 2013, the Power Division’s comparable
operating profit was EUR 858 million (2012:
1,146), i.e. EUR 288 million lower than in
2012. Significantly lower hydro volumes, the
increased real-estate tax for hydropower in
Sweden and the write-down of the Inkoo
power plant were the main reasons for the
decreased profit. The Nordic annual inflow
was approximately 10% lower in 2013

compared to 2012. The annual inflow in
Fortum’s hydropower production areas was
approximately 30% lower than in 2012.

Operating profit was EUR 921 million (2012:
1,175). The operating profit was affected by
sales gains totalling EUR 25 million (2012:
57) and by the IFRS accounting treatment
(IAS 39) of derivatives used mainly for

hedging Fortum's power production and
nuclear fund adjustments amounting to EUR
38 million (2012: -28).

The achieved Nordic power price was EUR
46.4 per MWh, or EUR 1.8 per MWh higher
than in 2012. The average system spot price
was EUR 38.1 per MWh (2012: 31.2), and the
average area price in Finland EUR 41.2 per
MWh (2012: 36.6) and in Stockholm,
Sweden, (SE3) 39.4 per MWh (2012: 32.3).

Significantly lower water reservoir levels and
lower inflow decreased hydro generation
significantly compared to 2012. Olkiluoto and
Forsmark had record-high production in
2013, nuclear outages were also shorter in
2013 resulting in higher volumes than during
the corresponding period in 2012. Nuclear
availability was at a good level in all reactors
except Oskarshamn 1 and 2. The total
nuclear volume was thus lower than during
the corresponding period in 2012. In 2013,
the Power Division had 1.9 TWh (2012: 0.6)
of thermal production in the Nordic
countries. Hence, the CO2-free production
amounted to 94% (2012: 97%).

The combined effect of volumes and the
achieved Nordic power price had a negative
impact of approximately EUR 235 million
during January-December 2013 compared to
the corresponding period in 2012. Operating
costs decreased as a result of savings

achieved through the efficiency programme,
even with higher depreciation (EUR 9 million).
In addition, the Swedish hydro power
property taxes increased by EUR 45 million
due to higher taxation values. The
discontinuation of the Inkoo power plant
caused an impairment loss of approximately
EUR 20 million.

In 2013, the division's total power generation
in the Nordic countries was 43.7 TWh (2012:
49.2), which corresponds to an
approximately 11% decrease compared to
2012.

Fortum has two fully-owned reactors in
Loviisa, Finland, and the company is also a
co-owner in eight reactors at the Olkiluoto,
Oskarshamn and Forsmark nuclear power
plants in Finland and Sweden. Nuclear
availability was at a good level in all of the
reactors except Oskarshamn 1 and 2, and all
the annual outages were executed with good
results.

2013 was a good production year for
Fortum’s Loviisa nuclear power plant. The
plant produced a total of 8.04 terawatt hours,
which is approximately 9% of Finland’s total
electricity production. The load factor, which
depicts the power plant’s availability, was

92.5%; Loviisa 1’s load factor was 92.1% and
Loviisa 2’s 93%. On an international scale this
was good compared to the worldwide load
factor for pressurised water power plants of
approximately 83% last year.

The process to update the real estate
taxation values in Sweden for 2013 was
finalised in the third quarter of 2013. The
update is done on a six-year cycle and
Fortum's costs increased by approximately
EUR 45 million in 2013 compared to 2012. At
the end of April 2013, Fortum filed a
complaint with the EU Commission on the
Swedish hydro tax to find out whether the
structure of the tax is in line with the EU tax
and State Aid regulations. The EU
Commission informed Fortum in June that it
will investigate the case in more detail, and
the investigation was still on-going at the end
of 2013.

In autumn 2013, Fortum announced that it
had decided to discontinue electricity
production at its Inkoo coal-fired power plant
in Finland. Production operations will end in
February 2014, after which the company will
mothball three units. As a consequence of
the decision to cease production, Fortum
booked an impairment loss of approximately
EUR 20 million in the Power Division’s

results. The decision is based on the weak
profitability of the Inkoo power plant.

In October, Fortum announced that it will
supply nitrogen oxides reduction systems to
coal-fired power plants owned by EDF Group
in Krakow and Wroclaw, Poland. The
deliveries are part of a project to be
implemented in 2014-2015. The systems
delivered by Fortum will bring the nitrogen
emissions of the power plants to clearly
below the European Union’s new, strict
emissions norms that take effect in 2016.
The value of the delivery is EUR 90 million,
and the project is being implemented in co-
operation with Instal Krakow S.A.

At year-end, the Power Division's total power
generating capacity was 9,475 megawatts
(MW) (2012: 9,702), of which 9,335 MW
(2012: 9,562) was in the Nordic countries.
Hydropower capacity in the Nordic countries
totalled 4,624 MW (2012: 4,627), nuclear
power capacity 3,276 MW (2012: 3,247) and
condensing capacity 1,435 MW (2012:

Operating and financial review

Heat sales volumes during 2013 amounted to
19.0 TWh (2012: 19.7) and power sales
volumes from CHP production totalled 4.8
TWh (2012: 4.2). The warm weather in the
last quarter reduced heat volumes.

The Heat Division’s comparable operating
profit in 2013 was EUR 273 million (201 2:
271). The profit increase was mainly due to
lower fuel costs. New CHP capacity and
better availability, especially in Finland,
increased power volumes. In 2013, fixed
costs were lower due to the efficiency

Heat sales by area

programme. Income from sales of CO2
allowances decreased.

Operating profit in 2013 totalled EUR 288
million (2012: 344). Sales gains related to
divestments totalled EUR 18 million (2012:
80).

In September, Fortum disclosed that Fortum
and the City of Stockholm have renewed their
co-ownership agreement of Fortum Varme,
the jointly-owned power and heat company
operating in the capital area in Sweden. The
agreement will come into force as of 2016,

when the existing ownership agreement
expires.

At year-end, the Heat Division's power
generating capacity totalled 1,398 MW
(2012: 1,569), of which 1,048 MW (2012:
1,315) was in the Nordic countries. The Heat
Division's total heat production capacity was
7,943 MW (2012: 8,785), of which 5,751 MW
(2012: 6,785) was in the Nordic countries.

Fortum operates in the well-developed
industrial regions of the Urals and in the oil-
producing Western Siberia.

The liberalisation of the Russian wholesale
power market has been completed since the
beginning of 2011. However, all generating
companies continue to sell a part of their
electricity and capacity - an amount
equalling the consumption of households and
a few special groups of consumers - under
regulated prices. During the fourth quarter of
2013, Fortum sold approximately 83% of its
power production in Russia at a liberalised
electricity price.

The capacity selection for generation built
prior to 2008 (CCS -“old capacity”) for 2013
was held at the end of 2012. In the selection
auction, the majority of Fortum’s power
plants were selected, with a price level close
to the level received in 2012. Approximately
10% (265 megawatts, MW) of the old capacity
was not allowed to participate in the
selection for 2013, due to tightened technical
requirements. It did, however, receive
capacity payments at the capacity market
price during 2013.

The generation capacity built after 2007
under the government capacity supply
agreements (CSA - “new capacity”) receives
guaranteed payments for a period of 10

years. The period and the prices for capacity
under CSA are defined to ensure a sufficient
return on investments. At the time of the
acquisition in 2008, Fortum made a provision,
as penalty clauses are included in the CSA
agreement in case of possible delays. If the
new capacity is delayed or if the agreed
major terms of the capacity supply
agreement are not otherwise fulfilled,
possible penalties can be claimed. The effect
of changes in the timing of commissioning of
new units is assessed at each balance sheet
date and the provision is changed
accordingly.

The new capacity will bring income from new
volumes sold and will receive considerably
higher capacity payments than the old
capacity. However, received capacity
payments will differ depending on the age,
location, type and size of the plant as well as
seasonality and availability. The regulator will
review the guaranteed CSA payments by re-
examining earnings from the electricity-only
market three years and six years after the
commissioning of a unit and could revise the
CSA payments accordingly. In addition, CSA
payments can vary somewhat annually
because they are linked to the Russian
Government long-term bonds with 8 to 10
years maturity.

The company’s extensive investment
programme is a key driver of growth in
Russia. The last units have been slightly
delayed by some months and the programme
is now due to be completed during the first
half of 2015. After the completion of the
investment programme, the power generation
capacity of the Russia Division will have
nearly doubled and will exceed 5,100 MW.
Fortum’s goal is to achieve an operating
profit level (EBIT) of about EUR 500 million
run-rate in its Russia Division during 2015
and to create positive economic value added
in Russia.

The Russia Division's power sales volumes
amounted to 25.6 TWh (2012: 23.3) during
2013. Heat sales totalled 24.1 TWh (2012:
26.4) during the same period.

The Russia Division’s comparable operating
profit was EUR 156 million (2012: 68) in
January-December 2013. The positive effect
from the commissioning of the new units
amounted to approximately EUR 163 million
(2012: 87), including a reversal of the CSA
provision totalling EUR 48 million. In addition,
the EUR 40 million in compensation for CSA
penalties received from E4 (the general
contractor of the Nyagan power plant) was
booked and recognised in the fourth quarter.
The result was burdened by EUR 16 million in
bad debt losses for Energostream group and

EUR 23 million due to unplanned outages. In
addition, volumes were impacted negatively
by the lower heat volumes due to
exceptionally warm weather at both the
beginning and end of 2013 as well as by the
divestment of the heating network assets in
Surgut in 2012.

Operating profit was EUR 156 million (2012:
79) in 2013. In 2012, the operating profit
included a gain of EUR 11 million relating to

the divestment of heating network assets in
Surgut.

In late March, Fortum finished the final stages
in the construction of its Nyagan power plant
unit 1. Accordingly, the company started
receiving capacity payments for the unit from
1 April 2013 onwards. As of 1 December also
Nyagan power plant unit 2 was
commissioned and started receiving capacity
payments. Nyagan 3 will be finalised at the

end of 2014. The capacity payments for the
Nyagan unit 3 will start as of 1 January 2015.

At year-end, the Russia Division's total power
generating capacity was 4,250 MW (2012:
3,404) and the division's total heat
production capacity was 13,466 MW (2012:

@ Fortum Annual Report 2013

Operating and financial review

In 2013, the volume of distribution and
regional network transmissions totalled 26.1
TWh (2012: 26.6) and 16.3 TWh (2012:
17.3), respectively.

The Distribution business area's comparable
operating profit was EUR 331 million (2012:
320). The increased profits are mainly
attributable to an increased amount of
relocation of cables and parts of the network.

Operating profit in 2013 totalled EUR 348
million (2012: 331) and was affected by sales
gains totalling EUR 17 million (2012: 5).

In January 2013, Fortum announced that it
had decided to assess the strategic position
of its electricity distribution business; the
assessment was concluded in December. The
assessment has no impact on Fortum's
electricity distribution customers and
excludes the company's electricity retail
business.

The Finnish government submitted a
Government Bill for the renewal of electricity
market legislation in the spring of 2013, and
the new Electricity Market act came into
force on 1 September 2013. The new
legislation includes implementation of the 3rd
electricity market directive and functional
demands on electricity grids. This includes
that the maximum length of outages should
be limited to six hours for urban areas and 36
hours for rural areas after a 15-year transition
period. Also, gradual increases in customer
compensation for long outages have been
included; 150% of the annual grid fee after 8
days of outage and 200% of the annual grid
fee for outages longer than 12 days. The
maximum amount would be increased from
700 euros to 2,000 euros by 2015.

Both in Finland and Sweden, legal processes
are under way concerning the appeals filed
regarding the network income regulatory
period 2012-2015, which came into force as
of 1 January 2012. In Finland, the appeal of

Volume of distributed electricity in distribution network

the national grid company Fingrid is being
processed in the Supreme Administrative
Court; in Sweden the Administrative Court
ruled in favour of the network companies, in
December. The Energy Market Inspectorate
decided, however, to appeal the decision, and
the process continues.

At the end of 2013, a total of almost 620,000
smart meters with hourly measurement
capabilities had been installed for network
customers in Finland over the course of three
years in Fortum’s electricity distribution areas
(434,000 at year-end 2012). The new meters
are part of the smart electricity network of
the future, enabling more efficient energy use
through, for example, hourly measurement of
electricity consumption and real-time billing,
and supporting the transition towards a more
sustainable energy system. The new
legislation on hourly meter reading in Finland
became effective as of 1 January 2014.

finalising the project. In June, all the B-series
shareholders signed the loan agreement in
accordance with the proposal made by the
Board of Directors. Fortum's share of the new
shareholder loan is 25% (EUR 75 million). In
addition, Fortum has earlier committed to
another EUR 300 million shareholder loan in
the OL3 project; Fortum’s share of that
shareholder loan is 25% as well.

In June, TVO withdrew EUR 100 million from
the first EUR 300 million shareholder loan
commitment for the OL3 project; Fortum’s
share was EUR 25 million.

Wind power production was started at the
Blaiken wind power park (75 MW) in the first
quarter of the year. The first 30 windmills
underwent test runs in February and
commercial production was started in the
second quarter. The Blaiken wind power park
is co-owned by Skelleftea Kraft (60%) and
Fortum (40%).

In July, Fortum completed the divestment of
its 33% holding in Infratek ASA to a fund
managed by Triton, following the approval of
the Swedish and Norwegian competition
authorities. The sales price was
approximately EUR 38 million. A sales gain of
EUR 11 million was booked in the Power
Division's third-quarter 2013 results.

In September, Fortum and Metsahallitus
agreed to sell their Kuolavaara-Keulakkopaa
(50 MW) and Joukhaisselka (25 MW) pre-
construction stage wind power projects in
Lapland to the Impax New Energy Investors II
Fund (“NEF II”) managed by Impax Asset
Management. Fortum's share of the projects
is 51% and Metsahallitus’ 49%. The
transaction will be implemented in phases
and the sale is expected to be completed
during the first quarter of 2014. The
transaction will have a minor impact on
Fortum's Power Division’s financial results
and it will be booked over several quarters.
The sale price and other terms are not
disclosed.

Heat

In January, the cornerstone for the new, EUR
500 million biofueltired CHP plant was laid in
Stockholm (Vartan), Sweden; the plant is
scheduled to be ready in 2016. This project is
the largest ongoing investment in the Heat
Division.

In May, Fortum's new waste-fuelled CHP.
plant was inaugurated in Klaipeda, Lithuania.
Commercial operation started at the end of

the first quarter. The Klaipeda CHP plant has
a capacity of 60 MW heat and 20 MW
electricity. With an efficiency of almost 90%,
it is able to incinerate 230,000 tonnes of
waste and biomass annually, and by replacing
gas-fired capacity it reduces CO2 emissions
by approximately 100,000 tonnes annually.

In June, a new bio-fuelled CHP plant was
inaugurated in Jarvenpaa, Finland.
Commercial operation started in April. The
plant has a capacity of 63 MW heat and 23
MW electricity. Also in June, Fortum
announced that it is acquiring district heating
operations from the Estonian company
Erakiite in the city of Tartu. Eventually,
Fortum plans to connect the acquired
network area to Fortum's current network
supplied by the company's biomass and peat-
fired Tartu CHP plant. This will enable a larger
use of biomass, reduce CO2 emissions and
increase efficiency of heat production. After
the acquisition, Fortum owns the whole
district heating network of Tartu.

In September, Fortum inaugurated the first
large-scale biomass CHP plant in Latvian city
of Jelgava. The new plant covers
approximately 85% of the city’s district
heating demand. Fortum’s new power plant
uses wood chips as fuel and replaces old
natural gas-fired heat production in Jelgava.
The production capacity of the Jelgava power
plant is 23 MW electricity and 45 MW heat.
The plant will produce approximately 110
GWh of electricity and 230 GWh of heat per
year.

In October, Fortum disclosed that it had sold

its Kuusamo combined heat and power plant

to the Finnish energy company Adven Oy. The
sale had a minor impact on Fortum’s financial
result.

In November, Fortum sold its 50% stake in
the Finnish district heating

company Riihimaen Kaukolampé Oy to the
City of Riihimaki and to Riihimaen
Kaukolampé Oy. The divestment had a minor
impact on Fortum’s financial result. The total
sales price was EUR 11 million.

In November, Fortum inaugurated the second
unit at the Brista CHP plant in Sigtuna,
Stockholm. Brista 2 produces heat and power
from 240,000 tonnes of sorted municipal and
industrial waste annually and has a capacity
of 57 MW heat and 20 MW electricity. The
annual heat production is about 500 GWh,
and the estimated annual electricity
production is 140 GWh. Fortum co-owns the
plant (85%) together with the municipal

energy company Sollentuna Energi (15%).
Final testing was started late 2013.

In 2013, Heat launched a new commercial
concept for bio-oil. In the future, besides heat
and electricity, CHP+ plants will produce bio-
oil; in these plants, pyrolysis is integrated into
the production process. The commercial
scale CHP+ plant is the first of its kind in the
world and is being integrated with Fortum’s
Joensuu CHP plant in Finland. The Joensuu
bio-oil plant’s annual production of 50,000
tonnes corresponds to the heating needs of
more than 10,000 households. Fortum
Otso® bio-oil can be used at heat plants or in
industrial steam production as a replacement
for heavy and light fuel oil, and in the future,
bio-oil can be used as a raw material for
various biochemicals or traffic fuels.

In December, Fortum announced that it sold
its combined heat and power (CHP) plant as
well as its natural gas and district heating
network in the town of Nokia to the Finnish
energy company Leppakosken Sahké6. Fortum
also announced the sale of the Kauttua
combined heat and power plant in Eura, in
south-western Finland, to the Finnish energy
company Adven Oy. The sales had a minor
impact on Fortum’s financial performance
and the parties have agreed not to disclose
the sales price. In addition, in December,
Fortum’s Uimaharju combined heat and
power plant ownership was transferred to
Stora Enso as part of an arrangement signed
in 1990. According to the agreement, the
transfer price paid by Stora Enso is
approximately EUR 15 million. The impact on
Fortum’s financial result was marginal.

Russia

In late March, Fortum finished the final stages
in the construction of its Nyagan power plant
unit 1. Accordingly, the company started
receiving capacity payments for the unit as of
1 July 2013. The unit's capacity was certified
to exceed 420 MW.

As of 1 December, Nyagan unit 2 was
commissioned and started receiving capacity
payments. The second unit's certified
capacity is 424 MW.

Distribution

In June, Fortum agreed to sell its 47.9%
ownership in the Swedish energy company
Harjeans Kraft AB to the Finnish energy
company Oy Herrfors Ab, a subsidiary of
Katterné Group. The sales price was SEK 445

million (approximately EUR 51 million). The
transaction was completed in July and Fortum
booked a sales gain of EUR 17 million to
Distribution’s third-quarter 2013 financial
result.

In December, Fortum disclosed that it had
completed the assessment of the future
alternatives of its electricity distribution
business; the assessment was launched in
January 2013. After thorough consideration,
the company concluded that divesting the
electricity distribution business is the best
solution for the business and its customers,
Fortum's shareholders and the company's
other businesses. Fortum is evaluating the
possible further divestment opportunities
country by country.

Employees

In December 2013, Fortum disclosed that it
has agreed to sell its electricity distribution
business in Finland to Suomi Power Networks
Oy. The total consideration is EUR 2.55 billion
on a debt- and cash-free basis. Fortum
expects to complete the divestment process
during the first quarter of 2014, subject to
the necessary regulatory approvals as well as
customary closing conditions. Fortum
expects to book a one-time sales gain of EUR
1.8-1.9 billion corresponding to
approximately EUR 2.00 per share.

In June, Fortum acquired a solar power plant
in the state of Rajasthan, in north-western
India. The company's short-term ambition is

to build a small photo-voltaic (PV) solar
portfolio in order to gain experience in
different solar technologies and in operating
in the Indian power market. The power plant's
nominal peak capacity is 5.4 MW and its
annual production is approximately 9
gigawatt-hours. The plant will receive a
higher, guaranteed electricity price for 25
years. The period and the prices for power
generation under the government's power
purchase agreement are defined to ensure a
sufficient return on investment. In the short
term, Fortum is looking to invest some tens
of millions of euros — including this
acquisition — in developing its PV solar
competence and operations in India.

condition requiring medical treatment. He
started his sick leave immediately. During

Tapio Kuula's leave of absence, Fortum's CFO
Markus Rauramo assumed responsibility for
the duties of President and CEO. President

and CEO Kuula returned to work during the
second half of November 2013.

In February, Fortum announced that it will
renew its business structure as of 1 March
2014. The target of the reorganisation is to
strengthen Fortum's capability to execute the
company's strategy in the fast developing
operating environment. Fortum will report its
2014 first quarter financial results according
to the new structure.

The new structure will consist of four
reporting segments and staff functions. The
four segments are Heat, Electricity Sales and
Solutions, Power and Technology, Russia and

Outlook

Key drivers and risks

Fortum's financial results are exposed to a
number of strategic, political, financial and
operational risks. The key factor influencing
Fortum's business performance is the
wholesale price of electricity in the Nordic
region. The key drivers behind the wholesale
price development in the Nordic region are
the supply-demand balance, fuel and CO2
emissions allowance prices as well as the
hydrological situation. The completion of
Fortum’s investment programme in Russia is
also one key driver to the company’s result
growth, due to the increase in production
volumes.

The continued global economic uncertainty
and Europe's sovereign-debt crisis has kept
the outlook for economic growth
unpredictable. The overall economic
uncertainty impacts commodity and CO
emissions allowance prices, and this could
maintain downward pressure on the Nordic
wholesale price for electricity in the short
term. In the Russian business, the key factors
are the regulation around the heat business
and further development of electricity and
capacity markets. Operational risks related to
the investment projects in the current
investment programme are still valid. In all
regions, fuel prices and power plant
availability also impact profitability. In
addition, increased volatility in exchange
rates due to financial turbulence could have
both translation and transaction effects on
Fortum's financials, especially through the

Strategy, Mergers and Acquisitions, Legal,
Human Resources and IT, Communications
and Corporate Relations.

Matti Ruotsala is appointed Chief Operating
Officer (COO) and will act as deputy to the
CEO. Fortum's new CFO will be Timo
Karttinen, who also will head the Distribution
Division. Markus Rauramo will continue in a
new role as Executive Vice President, Heat,
Electricity Sales and Solutions, Per Langer as
Executive Vice President, Hydro Power and

SEK and RUB. In the Nordic countries, also
the regulatory and fiscal environment for the
energy sector has added risks for utility
companies.

For further details on Fortum's risks and risk
management, see the Risk management
section of the Operating and financial review
and Note 3 Financial risk management.

Nordic market

Despite macroeconomic uncertainty,
electricity will continue to gain a higher share
of the total energy consumption. Fortum
currently expects the average annual growth
rate in electricity consumption to be 0.5%,
while the growth rate for the nearest years
will largely be determined by macroeconomic
development in Europe and especially in the
Nordic countries. The new 650-MW Estlink-2
interconnector between Finland and Estonia
increases market coupling between the
Nordic and Baltic countries.

During the fourth quarter of 2013, the price
of oil improved, whereas coal and EUA ended
close to their opening levels. The price of
electricity for the upcoming twelve months
clearly decreased in the Nordic area,
whereas in Germany it was largely
unchanged.

In late January 2014, the future quotation for
coal (ICE Rotterdam) for the rest of 2014 was
around USD 81 per tonne, and the price for
CO2 for 2014 was about EUR 6 per tonne.

New Executive Management members are
Tiina Tuomela, Executive Vice President,
Nuclear and Thermal Power; Kari Kautinen,

In late January 2014, the electricity forward
price in Nord Pool for the rest of 2014 was
around EUR 32 per MWh. For 2015 the price
was around EUR 33 per MWh, and for 2016
around EUR 33 per MWh. In Germany, the
electricity forward price for the rest of 2014
was around EUR 36 per MWh and for 2015
EUR 37 per MWh.

In late January 2014, Nordic water reservoirs
were about 1 TWh above the long-term
average and 1 TWh above the corresponding
level of 2013.

Power

The Power Division's Nordic power price
typically depends on such factors as hedge
ratios, hedge prices, spot prices, availability
and utilisation of Fortum's flexible production
portfolio, and currency fluctuations. Excluding
the potential effects from the changes in the
power generation mix, a 1 EUR/MWh change
in the Power Division’s Nordic power sales
(achieved) price will result in an
approximately EUR 45 million change in
Fortum's annual comparable operating profit.
In addition, the comparable operating profit
of the Power Division will be affected by the
possible thermal power generation volumes
and its profits.

The on-going multi-year Swedish nuclear
investment programmes are expected to
enhance safety, improve availability and
increase the capacity of the current nuclear
fleet. The implementation of the investment

Operating and financial review

programmes could, however, affect
availability. Fortum’s power procurement
costs from co-owned nuclear companies are
affected by these investment programmes
through increased depreciation and finance
costs of associated companies.

Russia

The generation capacity built after 2007
under the Russian Government's Capacity
Supply Agreements (CSA - “new capacity”)
receives guaranteed capacity payments for a
period of 10 years. Prices for capacity under
CSA are defined in order to ensure a
sufficient return on investments.

Capacity not under CSA competes in the
competitive capacity selection (CCS - “old
capacity”). The capacity selection for 2014
was held in September 2013. In the selection
auction, the majority of Fortum’s power
plants were selected. The volume of Fortum’s
installed capacity not selected in the auction
totalled 132 MW, which is approximately
4.6% of Fortum’s total installed capacity. All
of Fortum’s capacity was allowed to
participate in the selection for 2014.

The Russia Division's new capacity will be a
key driver for earnings growth in Russia as it
will bring income from new volumes sold and
also receive considerably higher capacity
payments than the old capacity. However, the
received capacity payment will differ
depending on the age, location, size and type
of the plants as well as seasonality and
availability. The return on the new capacity is
guaranteed, as regulated in the CSA. The
regulator will review the earnings from the
electricity-only market three years and six
years after the commissioning of a unit and
could revise the CSA payments accordingly.
CSA payments can vary somewhat annually
because they are linked to Russian
Government long-term bonds with 8 to 10
years maturity.

Fortum estimates that the commissioning of
the Nyagan unit 3 will be finalised by the end
of 2014. The capacity payments for Nyagan
unit 3 will start as of 1 January 2015, one
year earlier than originally planned in 2008. In
accordance with the CSA terms, no penalties
for unit 3 can start to run before 1 January
2016.

The last two units of Fortum's Russian
investment programme are being built in
Chelyabinsk instead of Tyumen, as originally
planned. The units constructed at the
Chelyabinsk GRES power plant, originally

planned to be commissioned by the end of
2014, have been slightly delayed and are
scheduled to be finalised during the first half
of 2015 mainly due to extensive groundwork
at the brownfield site. The delay will not
cause any penalties. In addition, Fortum plans
to modernise and upgrade the existing
equipment of the power plant.

The value of the remaining part of the
investment programme, calculated at the
exchange rates prevailing at the end of
December 2013, is estimated to be
approximately EUR 0.5 billion, as of January
2014.

After completing the on-going investment
programme by mid-2015, Fortum’s goal is to
achieve an operating profit level (EBIT) of
about EUR 500 million run-rate in its Russia
Division during 2015 and to create positive
economic added value in Russia. The Russian
Government’s earlier target to increase gas
prices by 15% annually to reach netback price
parity with European prices by 2018 has
recently been changed. The forecast by the
Russian Ministry of Economic Development
now suggests much lower annual increases.
The Russia Division’s profits are impacted by
possible changes in gas prices, currency
exchange rates and other regulations. The
suggested gas price development and the
weaker Russian rouble make the
approximately EUR 500 million operating
profit level (EBIT) goal more challenging for
the Division, but the company is making every
effort to mitigate the negative impacts.

In 2013, the Ministry of Energy stated that a
Heat reform should be developed before
changing the current Electricity and Capacity
Market model. Therefore, at the end of the
year, the Ministry of Energy proposed a new
heat market model (for public discussion),
which is supposed to ensure transition to
economically justified heat tariffs by 2020
and to attract investments into the heat
sector. The new regulation concept is at an
early stage and expected to be further
developed during 2014.

Since the beginning of 2013, wholesale gas
prices (except for private household and
industrial consumers) have been reviewed
quarterly. In February 2013, the Board of
Russia's Federal Tariff Service (FTS) adopted
a decision according to which the wholesale
gas price for industrial consumers decreased
by 3% as of the second quarter 2013,
compared to first quarter. As of 1 July 2013,
the Russian Government increased gas prices
by 15% compared to June 2013, and in
October 2013 they were further increased by

1.9% in order to reach the planned total
increase of approximately 15% in

2013 compared to 2012. According to a
forecast made by the Russian Ministry of
Economic Development, Russian gas price
indexation will not take place as of July 2014.
However, year-on-year gas price growth is
estimated to be 7.6% in 2014.

Distribution

Fortum has disclosed that it has completed
the assessment of the future alternatives of
its electricity distribution business; the
assessment was launched in January 2013.
As a result, Fortum is evaluating the possible
divestment opportunities country by country.

Fortum's electricity distribution business in
Finland is to be sold to Suomi Power
Networks Oy. The divestment process is
expected to be finalised during the first
quarter of 2014 subject to the necessary
regulatory approvals as well as customary
closing conditions. The total consideration is
EUR 2.55 billion on a debt- and cash-free
basis. Fortum expects to book a one-time
sales gain of EUR 1.8-1.9 billion,
corresponding to approximately EUR 2.00 per
share in its Electricity Distribution and Sales
Division's first quarter 2014 results. A total of
340 employees will transfer with the business
at closing.

The work to define the Swedish network
income regulation model for the next
regulatory period 2016-2019 has been
ongoing and a first proposal from the Energy
Market Inspectorate is expected to come
during the first quarter of 2014.

Capital expenditure and
divestments

Fortum currently expects its capital
expenditure, excluding Varme in 2014, to be
approximately EUR 0.9-1.1 billion, excluding
potential acquisitions (including the Finnish
distribution business until the end of first
quarter 2014). The annual maintenance
capital expenditure is estimated to be about
EUR 400-500 million in 2014, below the level
of depreciation. Capex for electricity
distribution in Finland has been
approximately EUR 150 million annually.

Fortum will gradually decrease its financing to
Varme during 2014-2015. At the end of
2013, Varme's share of debt totalled
approximately EUR 1 billion.

Operating and financial review

Taxation

The effective corporate tax rate for Fortum in
2014 is estimated to be 19-21%, excluding
the impact of the share of profits of
associated companies and joint ventures,
non-taxable capital gains and non-recurring
items. In Finland, the corporate tax rate was
reduced from 24.5% to 20% as of 1 January
2014. In Sweden, the corporate tax rate was
decreased from 26.3% to 22% as of 1 January
2013.

The Finnish Parliament approved the power
plant tax (previously called windfall tax) in
December 2013. It will be enacted later and
will be applied from the beginning of 2014,
provided that the EU Commission approves it.

Fortum has filed a complaint on the tax to the
Commission, arguing that it is not in line with
general tax principles in Finland and that it
constitutes illegal state aid for those plants
that are not subject to the tax. If
implemented, the estimated impact on
Fortum would be approximately EUR 25
million annually.

Hedging

At the end of December 2013, approximately
60% of the Power Division's estimated Nordic
power sales volume was hedged at
approximately EUR 43 per MWh for the
calendar year 2014. The corresponding
figures for the calendar year 2015 were about
20% at approximately EUR 41 per MWh.

Research and development

Sustainability is at the core of Fortum’s
strategy, and Fortum's research and
development activities promote
environmentally-benign energy solutions.
Investments in the development of renewable
energy production, like wave and solar power,
are an important part of Fortum’s strategy
implementation.

In 2013, Fortum decided to participate in the
Sustainable Bioenergy Solutions for
Tomorrow (BEST) research programme
established by two Strategic Centres for
Science, Technology and Innovation (SHOK),
CLEEN Oy and FIBIC Oy, in Finland and India.
The programme's goal is to encompass a
completely new kind of collaboration
between forestry and energy know-how.

Fortum is also a co-signer along with DCNS
and AW-Energy of a development agreement

in wave power research and development
with the support of La Région Bretagne. As
part of the agreement, the companies will
develop a joint 1.5-MW wave power
demonstration project. Fortum will be
responsible for project development and will
be the owner of the demonstration park. The
agreement is an extension to the wave power
research and development collaboration
initiated in 2011 by DCNS and Fortum.

In addition, Fortum received a special award
for innovation from the Global District Energy
Climate Awards organisation. The prize was
awarded to Fortum for its investment project
using fast pyrolysis technology to produce
bio-oil in connection with existing district
heating production and a combined heat and
power plant. Commissioned at the end of the
year, the commercial plant is the first of its
kind in the world and integrated with

The hedge price for the Power Division's
Nordic generation excludes hedging of the
condensing power margin. In addition, the
hedge ratio excludes the financial hedges and
physical volume of Fortum's coal-condensing
generation as well as the division’s imports
from Russia.

The reported hedge ratios may vary
significantly, depending on Fortum's actions
on the electricity derivatives markets. Hedges
are mainly financial contracts, most of them
Nord Pool forwards.

Fortum’s Joensuu CHP plant. The use of bio-
oil has significant positive environmental
impacts because energy produced with bio-
oil reduces greenhouse gas emissions by as
much as 90% or more compared to fossil
fuels.

Fortum acquired a solar power plant in the
state of Rajasthan, in north-western India.
The company's short-term ambition is to
build a small photo-voltaic (PV) solar portfolio
in order to gain further experience in different
solar technologies.

The Group reports its R&D expenditure on a
yearly basis. In 2013, Fortum’s R&D
expenditure was EUR 49 million (2012: 41) or
0.8% (2012: 0.7%) of sales.

Sustainability

Fortum strives for balanced management of
economic, social and environmental
responsibility in the company’s operations.
Fortum's sustainability targets consist of
Group-level key indicators and division-level
indicators.

The Group-level sustainability targets
emphasise Fortum's role in society and
measure not only environmental and safety
targets, but also Fortum's reputation,
customer satisfaction, and the security of
supply of power and heat.

The achievement of the sustainability

targets is monitored through monthly,
quarterly and annual reporting. As of the
beginning of 2013, results of the
sustainability indicators have been regularly

Associates’ profits

Fortum’s climate targets over the next five
years are: specific COz emissions from power
generation in the EU below 80 grams per
kilowatt-hour (g/kWh) and total specific COz
emissions from both electricity and heat
production in all countries below 200 g/kWh.
Both targets are calculated as a five-year
average. At the end of December 2013, the
five-year average for specific CO2 emissions
from power generation in the EU was at 66
g/kWh (2012: 60) and the total specific COz
emissions from energy production were at
186 g/kWh (2012: 179), both better than the
target level.

Fortum's total CO2 emissions in 2013
amounted to 21.3 million tonnes (Mt) (2012:
20.7), of which 6.0 Mt (2012: 4.8) were
within the EU's emissions trading scheme (EU
ETS). Since 2013, electricity production does
not receive free allowances in the EU

ETS. The amount of free allowances for heat
will gradually decrease during 2013-2020 as
well. Plant-specific free allowances have not
yet been confirmed for 2013. The preliminary
estimate for Fortum is about 3.0 Mt, which is
clearly less than the 5.4 Mt in 2012.

Fortum's energy efficiency target is to raise
the overall efficiency of fuel use to 70% as a
five-year average. In 2013, the overall
efficiency of fuel use was 61% (2012: 64%)
and the five-year average after September
was 66% (2012: 67%), meaning the target
level was not met.

Fortum's target is for fewer than 40
environmental incidents annually. In 2013, a
total of 51 (2012: 36) environmental
incidents took place in Fortum's operations.
This includes 19 leaks or spills of oil into the
environment, 12 fires, 14 environmental non-
compliances, four explosions and two
International Nuclear Event Scale 1 incidents
(INES). None of these incidents had
significant environmental or financial
impacts.

Social responsibility

In the area of social responsibility, Fortum's
innovations and the secure supply of low-
carbon power and heat support the
development of society and increase well-
being. Good corporate citizenship, reliable
energy supply and ensuring a safe working
environment for all employees and
contractors at Fortum sites are emphasised.
At the end of 2013, OHSAS 18001
certification covered 75% of Fortum's power
and heat production and distribution
operations worldwide.

In 2013, the average energy availability of
Fortum's European CHP plants was 93.9
(2012: 90.9), which is above the annual
target level of 92%. In electricity distribution,
the cumulative SAIDI (System Average
Interruption Duration Index) was 220 minutes
(2012: 103) in 2013, while the annual target
is less than 110 minutes. The high SAID! was
caused by severe storms in Finland and
Sweden in December 2013.

In 2013, the Group-level lost workday injury
frequency (LWIF) was 1.1 (2012: 1.5), which
is close to the target level of less than one
per million working hours for Fortum's own
personnel. In contrast to the LWIF for

Fortum's own employees, contractor safety
has not developed as desired. The injury
frequency is higher than in 2012. Safety
improvements were implemented in 2013
and include more precise instructions and
requirements and increased supervision of
high-risk jobs. Fortum's categorical target is
to avoid serious injuries.

Fortum wants to conduct business with viable
companies that act responsibly and comply
with the Fortum Code of Conduct and the
Fortum Supplier Code of Conduct. In 2013,
Fortum audited 13 suppliers, focusing on
biomass suppliers and contractors.

Risk management

Risk management is an integrated part of business planning and performance management. The objective of
risk management within Fortum is to support the creation of the corporate strategy, enable the strategy
execution, support the achievement of agreed financial targets, and avoid unwanted operational events.

Risk management framework and objectives

Involvement in the power and heat business
exposes Fortum to several types of risks. The
main sources of risk in the Nordic business
are electricity prices and volumes, which in
turn are affected by the weather in the Nordic
region, the development of the global
commodity markets and availability of power
production. The Russian business is exposed
to risks related to fuel, electricity and
capacity prices and volumes, which are to a
large extent subject to regulation, although
the market is developing.

Fortum is continuously developing its risk
management capabilities to cope with
prevailing market conditions, developing
operations and an ever changing business
environment. In the operational risk
management area, the focus has been on
further enhancing the framework for internal
controls, compliance risk management and
business continuity management. At the
same time, market and credit risk modelling
has been developed in order to cope with an
increasingly global and volatile market. Also

Group risk policy

Fortum's Board of Directors annually
approves the Group Risk Policy, which sets
the objective, principles and division of
responsibilities for risk management activities
within the Group as well as defines the overall
risk management process.

Risk management organisation

The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible
for risk oversight within the Group. Corporate
Risk Management is an independent function
headed by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), who Fortum's risk reporting structure
reports to the CFO, and is responsible for
assessing and reporting the Group's
consolidated risk exposure to the Board of
Directors and Group Management. Corporate
Risk Management also monitors and reports
risk in relation to mandates approved by the
CEO. The main principle is that risks are
managed at the source, unless otherwise
agreed. In order to maintain a strict
segregation of duties, risk control functions in
the divisions and corporate units, like
Treasury, are responsible for reporting risks
to Corporate Risk Management.

@ Fortum Annual Report 2013

Operating and financial review

Risk factors

Risk control, monitoring and reporting is
carried out by the divisional and corporate
unit risk control functions. The frequency of
reporting is dependent upon the scope of the
business. For example, trading activities and
limit breaches are reported daily whereas
strategic and operational risks are reported
as part of the annual business planning
process and followed up at least quarterly in
management reviews. Corporate Risk
Management assesses and reports the
Group's consolidated exposure to financial
and market risks to Group Management and
the Board of Directors on a monthly basis.

Strategic risks

Fortum's strategy is based on three areas of
focus:

* Leverage the strong Nordic core
* Create solid earnings growth in Russia
* Build a platform for future growth

Investment, integration and
project risks

Fortum's growth strategy includes expansion
of operations. As a result of ongoing
integrations or any future acquisitions, there
is a risk to existing operations, including:

* additional demands placed on senior
management, who are also responsible
for managing existing operations;

* increased overall operating complexity
and requirements for personnel and other
resources in other cultures;

* the need to attract and retain sufficient
numbers of qualified management and
other personnel.

Within the projects that are part of the
Russian investment programme, as with all
large projects, there is a risk of delays, for
example in establishing new capacity and grid
connections. The project risks are closely
monitored by the management and risks are
followed up in monthly management
reporting.

Political and regulatory risks

The political and regulatory environment has
a clear impact on energy businesses. This
applies both to existing and potential new
businesses and market areas. Fortum is thus
exposed to regulatory risks in various
countries.

endanger market-driven development of the
energy sector and the uncertainty with regard
to future policy targets and framework is
currently considerable. Fortum favours
market-driven development, which would
mean e.g. more interconnections and
competition in addition to policy
harmonisation, by maintaining an active
dialogue with all stakeholders.

Currently the biggest potential risks within
the policy framework relate to the electricity
market model, targets with regard to future
climate change mitigation and renewable
energy and taxation. In particular, the
interlinkages of these issues create
uncertainty, as they are overlapping

and undermine the effects of each other. The
EU is currently discussing capacity
remuneration mechanisms that would change
the market model. The specific details of
targets for COz2 emissions and renewables for
2030 are also under discussion. At the end
of 2013 in Finland, a Government Bill for a
windfall tax on some non-emitting and old
power plants was approved. Furthermore, the
nuclear safety directive is under revision, and

Operating and financial review

a discussion on broadening nuclear liability in
the EU is starting.

All these would pose risks, but also
opportunities, for energy companies. To
manage these risks and proactively
participate in the development of the political
and regulatory framework, Fortum maintains
an active dialogue with the bodies involved in
the development of laws and regulations at
national and EU-levels.

Russia

Russia is exposed to political, economic and
social uncertainties and risks resulting from
changes in policies, legislation, economic and
social upheaval and other similar factors, as
other similar countries.

Fortum owns and operates heat and power
generation assets in Russia under the
operations of OAO Fortum. The wholesale
power market deregulation in Russia has
proceeded well and to a large extent
according to original plans. The main policy-
related risks in Russia are linked to the
development of the whole energy sector, part
of which, namely wholesale electricity, is
liberated while other parts, like gas, heat,
and retail electricity, are not. Currently, there
is the risk that the Government will freeze
tariffs of certain regulated products including
gas, which creates a risk for Fortum's

efficient operations. Cross-subsidies, which
are supposed to be eliminated but still exist,
compromise the competitiveness of energy-
efficient combined heat and power (CHP)
production. Artificially low energy prices do
not benefit anyone in the long run, as they
promote inefficiency by limiting investments
in efficiency.

Political risk concerning taxes

The current economic situation in Fortum's
key operating territories has created an
unstable tax environment leading to new or
increased taxes and new interpretations of
existing tax laws. This in turn has led to
unexpected challenges for Fortum in the way
the Group is organised and how its
operations are taxed. The certainty and
visibility around taxes has decreased. Where
there is uncertainty, Fortum seeks to
maintain its position in line with its tax policy.

Legal and compliance risks

Fortum's operations are subject to rules and
regulations set forth by the relevant
authorities, exchanges, and other regulatory
bodies in all markets in which it operates.

Inadequacies in the legal systems and law
enforcement mechanisms in Russia and

Commodity market risks

Commodity market risk refers to the potential
negative effects of market price movements
or volume changes in electricity, fuels and
environmental values. A number of different
methods, such as Profit-at-Risk and Value-at-
Risk, are used throughout the Group to
quantify these risks and to take into account
their interdependencies. Stress-testing is
carried out in order to assess the effects of
extreme price movements on Fortum's
earnings.

Fortum hedges its exposure to commodity
market risks in accordance with the Hedging
Guidelines. Risk taking is limited by risk
mandates, including volumetric limits, Profit-
at-Risk limits and stop-loss limits. The Profit-
at-Risk measure in the form of Group
minimum EBITDA is monitored by
management to ensure that Fortum can
deliver on its financial commitments without
weakening its financial position. The
development of minimum EBITDA is

monitored in quarterly meetings and in
monthly reporting.

All products and marketplaces used for
hedging and trading are approved by the
CRO.

For further information on hedge ratios,
exposures, sensitivities and outstanding
derivatives contracts, see Note 3 Financial

risk management.

Electricity price and volume
risks

Fortum is exposed to electricity market price
movements and volume changes mainly
through its power generation and customer
sales businesses. In competitive markets,
such as in the Nordic region, the price is
determined as the balance between supply
and demand. The short-term factors affecting
electricity prices on the Nordic market

certain other emerging markets expose
Fortum to a risk of loss resulting from
criminal or abusive practices by competitors,
suppliers, or contracting parties. Fortum's
ability to operate in Russia may also be
adversely affected by difficulties in protecting
and enforcing its rights in disputes with its
contractual partners or other parties
concerning, for example, regulatory influence
on business and unfair market conditions,
and also by future changes to local laws and
regulations.

Fortum maintains strict internal market
conduct rules and has procedures in place to
prevent, for example, the use of confidential
information before it is published.
Segregation of duties and internal controls
are enforced to minimise the possibilities of
unauthorised activities.

Compliance with competition legislation is an
important area for Fortum. Fortum has also
enhanced its compliance risk management by
establishing a process to systematically and
separately identify and mitigate compliance
risks linked to the operational risk framework.
This process aims to capture also potential
bribery risks. Fortum has also rolled-out the
Code of Conduct, including the bribery risk
assessment process, to enhance the
compliance to business ethics.

include hydrological conditions, temperature,
COz allowance prices, fuel prices, and the

import/export situation.

In the Nordic business, power and heat
generation, customer sales and electricity
distribution volumes are subject to changes
in, for example, hydrological conditions and
temperature. Uncertainty in nuclear
production due to prolonged maintenance or
delays in upgrades, especially in co-owned
plants in Sweden, has also increased in
recent years.

Electricity price and volume risks are hedged
by entering into electricity derivatives
contracts, primarily on the Nordic power
exchange, Nasdaq OMX (Nord Pool). The
objective of hedging is to reduce the effect of
electricity price volatility on earnings and
cash flows, and to secure a minimum level of
earnings and cash flow, which ensures that
financial commitments can be met. Hedging
strategies cover several years in the short to

medium term and are executed by the trading
unit within set mandates. These hedging
strategies are continuously evaluated as
electricity and other commodity market
prices, the hydrological balance and other
relevant parameters change.

In Russia, electricity prices and capacity sales
are the main sources of market risk. Market
deregulation has developed as planned and
the electricity price is highly correlated with
the gas price. Hedges are mainly done
through regulated bilateral agreements, but
the financial market is developing and Fortum
is utilising the possibilities in these markets
to further mitigate electricity price risks.

amount of COz emissions. The COz
emissions trading scheme enhances the
integration of the Nordic market with the rest
of Europe. In addition to the emissions
trading scheme, there are other trading
schemes in environmental values in place in
Sweden, Norway and Poland. There is
currently no trading scheme in Russia for
emissions or other environmental values. The
main factor influencing the prices of CO2
allowances and other environmental values is
the supply and demand balance.

Part of Fortum's power and heat generation is
subject to requirements of these schemes.
Fortum manages its exposure to these prices
and volumes through the use of derivatives,
such as CO? forwards, and by ensuring that
the costs of allowances are taken into
account during production planning.

terms of debt maturity profile, debt
instruments and geographical markets.
Fortum manages liquidity and refinancing
risks through a combination of cash positions
and committed credit facility agreements with
its core banks. Fortum shall at all times have
access to cash, bank deposits and unused
committed credit facilities, including

Fuel price and volume risks

Heat and power generation requires the use
of fuels that are purchased on global or local
markets. The main fuels used by Fortum are
uranium, coal, natural gas, peat, oil, and
various biomass-based fuels such as wood
pellets.

For fuels that are traded on global markets
such as coal and oil, the uncertainty in price
is the main factor. Prices are largely affected
by demand and supply imbalances that can
be caused by, for example, increased
demand growth in developing countries,
natural disasters or supply constraints in
countries experiencing political or social
unrest. The main fuel source for heat and
power generation in Russia is natural gas.
Natural gas prices are partially regulated, so
the exposure is limited. For fuels traded on
local markets, such as bio-fuels, the volume
risk in terms of access to the raw material of
appropriate quality is more significant as
there may be a limited number of suppliers.

Exposure to fuel prices is limited to some
extent because of Fortum's flexible
generation possibilities that allow for
switching between different fuels according
to prevailing market conditions and, in some
cases, the fuel price risk can be transferred
to the customer. The remaining exposure to
fuel price risk is mitigated through fixed-price
purchases that cover forecasted
consumption levels. Fixed-price purchases
can be either for physical deliveries or in the
form of financial hedges.

floating-rate basis with differing maturity
profiles. Fortum manages the duration of the
debt portfolio by entering into different types
of financing contracts and interest rate
derivative contracts, such as interest rate
swaps and forward rate agreements (FRAs).

Currency risks

Fortum has cash flows, assets and liabilities
in currencies other than the euro. Changes in

exchange rates can therefore have an effect
on Fortum's earnings and balance sheet. The
main currency exposures are EUR/SEK,
arising from Fortum's extensive operations in
Sweden and EUR/RUB from translation
exposure of OAO Fortum in Russia.

Fortum's currency exposures are divided into
transaction exposures (foreign exchange
exposures relating to contracted cash flows
and balance sheet items where changes in
exchange rates will have an impact on

Counterparty risks

Fortum is exposed to counterparty risk
whenever there is a contractual arrangement
with a customer, supplier, financing partner
or trading counterparty. During 2013 Fortum
enhanced the country entry and partner risk
assessment processes when entering new
markets and/or partnerships.

Credit risk exposures relating to financial
derivative instruments are often volatile.
Although the majority of commodity
derivatives are cleared through exchanges,
derivatives contracts are also entered into
directly with external counterparties. Such
contracts are limited to high-credit-quality
counterparties active on the financial or
commodity markets.

Due to the financing needs and management
of liquidity, Fortum has counterparty
exposure to a number of banks and financial
institutions. This includes exposure to the
Russian financial sector in terms of deposits

with financial institutions as well as to banks
that provide guarantees for suppliers and
contracting parties. Limits with banks and
financial institutions are followed closely so
that exposures can be adjusted as ratings or
the financial situation changes.

Credit risk exposures relating to customers
and suppliers are spread across a wide range
of industrial counterparties, small businesses
and private individuals over a range of
geographic regions. The majority of exposure
is to the Nordic market, but there is also
significant exposure in Russia and Poland as
a result of increased operations. The risk of
non-payment in the electricity and heat sales
business in Russia is higher than in the
Nordic market.

In order to minimise counterparty risk,
Fortum has well established routines and
processes to identify, assess and control
counterparty exposure. No contractual

Operational risks

Operational risks are defined as the negative
effects resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes, people and systems or
equipment, or from external events. The main
objective of operational risk management is
to reduce the risk of unwanted operational
events by clearly documenting and
automating processes and by ensuring a
strict segregation of duties between decision-
making and controlling functions. Quality and
environmental management systems are a
tool for achieving this objective, and Fortum
has several certifications including ISO 9001
and ISO 14001. Equipment and system risks
are primarily managed within maintenance
investment planning, and there are
contingency plans in place to ensure
business continuity. Operational risks in

production facilities (nuclear, hydro and heat
plants) are mitigated by continuous
maintenance, condition monitoring, and other
operational improvements.

The Corporate Insurance Steering Document
defines the management of insurable
operational risks. The objective of insurance
management is to optimise loss prevention
activities, self retentions and insurance
coverage in a long-term cost-efficient
manner. Fortum has established Group-wide
insurance programmes for risks related to
property damages, business interruption and
liability exposures.

earnings and cash flows) and translation
exposure (foreign exchange exposure that
arises when profits and balance sheets in
foreign entities are consolidated at the Group
level). For transaction risks, the main
principle is that all material exposures are
hedged while translation exposures are not
hedged or are hedged selectively.

obligations are entered into without proper,
reasonable and viable credit checks, and
creditworthiness is continuously monitored
through the use of internal and external
sources to ensure that actions can be taken
immediately if changes occur.

Corporate Credit Control is responsible for
assuring stringent controls for all larger
individual counterparty exposures. Annual
credit reviews are performed manually for all
larger approved limits. Each division or
corporate unit is responsible for ensuring that
exposures remain within approved limits.
Mitigation of counterparty risk includes the
use of collateral, such as guarantees,
managing payment terms and contract
length, and netting agreements. Corporate
Credit Control continuously monitors and
reports counterparty exposures against the
approved limits.

Hydro power

Operational events at hydro power generation
facilities can lead to physical damages,
business interruptions, and third- party
liabilities. A long-term programme is in place
for improving the surveillance of the condition
of dams and for securing the discharge
capacity in extreme flood situations.

In Sweden, third-party liabilities from dam
failures are strictly the plant owner's
responsibility. Together with other

hydro power producers, Fortum has a shared
dam liability insurance programme in place
that covers Swedish dam failure liabilities up
to SEK 9,000 million.

Operating and financial review

Nuclear power

Fortum owns the Loviisa nuclear power plant,
and has minority interests in one Finnish and
two Swedish nuclear power companies. At
the Loviisa power plant, the assessment and
improvement of nuclear safety is a
continuous process is performed under the
supervision of the Radiation and Nuclear
Safety Authority of Finland (STUK).

In Finland and Sweden, third-party liability
relating to nuclear accidents is strictly the
plant operator's responsibility and must be
covered by insurance.

As the operator of the Loviisa power plant,
Fortum has a statutory liability insurance
policy of 600M SDR (Special Drawing Right).
The same type of insurance policies are in
place for the operators where Fortum has a
minority interest. In Sweden, the limits are
compliant with the national legislation.

Decisions have been made in both Finland
and Sweden to renew the current nuclear
liability legislation to align more with the Paris
and Brussels convention. The new legislation
is not likely to come into force during 2014 in
Finland and Sweden. The changes in the new
national legislation consist of a liability on
plant operators covering damages up to EUR
700 million in Finland and up to EUR 1,200
million per nuclear incident in Sweden. The
liability should be covered by insurance or
other form of financial guarantee, as well as a
strict and unlimited liability for the plant
operators in each respective country.

Under Finnish law, Fortum bears full legal and
financial responsibility for the management
and disposal of nuclear waste produced by
the Loviisa power plant. In both Finland and
Sweden, Fortum bears partial

responsibility, proportionate to the output
share, for the costs of the management and
disposal of nuclear waste produced by co-
owned nuclear power plants.

In both Finland and Sweden, the future costs
of the final disposal of spent fuel, the
management of low and intermediate-level
radioactive waste and nuclear power plant
decommissioning are provided for by a state-
established fund to which nuclear power
plant operators make annual contributions.

Multilayered containment systems and
sophisticated safety protocols effectively
isolate radioactive materials from the
surrounding environment during the process
of interim storage, packaging, transport,
relocation and encasement of nuclear waste
in the final storage repositories.

Distribution facilities

Operational events at distribution facilities
can lead to physical damages, business
interruptions, and third-party liabilities.
Storms and other unexpected events can
result in electricity outages that create costs
in the form of repairs and customer
compensations. Although outages are
typically short, it is not possible to completely
prevent long outages. There are extensive
procedures in place to minimise the length
and consequences of outages.

Sustainability risks

The assessment of sustainability risks is also
included in the assessment of business risks.
The Corporate Sustainability function
assesses the risks related to Group
operations as part of the annual planning. The
divisions assess the risks identified by the
Corporate Sustainability function in their own
annual planning and prepare for their control.
Business divisions with ISO 14001
certification manage their environmental risks
and their preparedness to operate in
exceptional and emergency situations in
compliance with the requirements of the
standard.

Operating power and heat generation and
distribution facilities involves the use, storage
and transportation of fuels and materials that
can have adverse effects on the environment.
Operation and maintenance of the facilities
expose the personnel to potential safety
risks. The risks involved with these activities
and their supply chain are receiving increased
attention. There is also a growing public
awareness of sustainable development and
the expectations on companies' responsible
conduct.

Environmental, health and safety (EHS) risks
are regularly evaluated through internal and

external audits and risk assessments, and
corrective and preventive actions are
launched when necessary. EHS related risks
arising in investments are systematically
evaluated in accordance with Fortum's
Investment Evaluation and Approval
Procedure. Environmental risks and liabilities
in relation to past actions have been
assessed and necessary provisions made for
future remedial costs.

Technology risks

Fortum actively explores opportunities in new
technologies in a solar economy. Fortum is
participating in technologies and projects in
solar and wave energy, and in 2013 invested
in the first solar plant in India. New
technologies, like bio-oil and solar, expose
Fortum to new types of risks, such as IPR
risks and viability of technologies. These,

in combination with operating in new
markets, add complexity.

IT and information security
risks

Information security risks are managed
centrally by the Corporate Security and IT
functions. Business-specific IT risks are
managed within the divisions and corporate
units. Group IT instructions set procedures
for reducing risks and managing IT and other
information security incidents. The main
objective is to ensure high availability and
fast recovery of IT systems. Fortum's IT
community identifies the IT-

related operational risks that might
threaten business continuity, and the
mitigating actions are planned accordingly.
Fortum IT is exposed to hardware and
software risks including cyber attacks, as is
any other corporate function, however, taking
into account the size and complexity of the
business. The management of these risks is
coordinated by Corporate IT, headed by the
CIO, who also manages the IT architecture
and strategy.
