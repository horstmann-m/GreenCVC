Strategy and Objectives

Our Strategy:
Partner for the New Energy World

Adopted in 2014, E.ON's strategy focuses our company system-
atically on the new energy world of empowered and proactive
customers, renewables and distributed energy, energy efficiency,
local energy systems, and digital solutions. By seizing the initia-
tive, EON can—for the benefit of our customers, employees,
business partners, shareholders, and society in general—take
advantage of the significant opportunities created by the emer-
gence of the new energy world.

Our strategy reflects three fundamental market developments
and corresponding growth businesses: the global trend toward
renewables (particularly wind and solar), the evolution of energy
networks into a platform for distributed-energy solutions, and
customers’ changing needs. We aim to add value in all of our
businesses by delivering an outstanding performance in key areas,
such as continual innovation, an unambiguous commitment to
sustainability, and a strong brand.

Objectives and Core Businesses

E.ON is based in Essen, Germany, and has around 43,000
employees. With a clear focus on three strong core busi-
nesses—Energy Networks, Customer Solutions, and Renew-
ables—we aim to become the partner of choice for energy
and customer solutions:

« Energy Networks: Energy networks link our customers
together and are the hub for grid digitalization, such as the
direct marketing of distributed energy. In Germany, about
one third of distributed generating capacity subsidized by
the Renewable Energy Law is connected to our networks.
Regional energy networks are what makes the transforma-
tion of the energy system possible. E.ON is already a leader
in network efficiency and will continue to set new standards
in the future.

¢ Customer Solutions: E.ON is expanding its top-quality offer-
ings in the physical and digital new energy world for municipal,
public, industrial, commercial, and residential customers in
attractive regional markets. We strive to become customers’
partner of choice. This is based on a consistently superior cus-
tomer experience, strong digital orientation, and high-quality
service. In addition, we will continually improve or redefine
our portfolio of products and services in response to customers’
demand for energy efficiency, distributed generation and
storage, and sustainable mobility solutions.

18

¢ Renewables: E.ON's international renewables business
focuses in attractive target regions (Europe and North America)
and customer-relevant technologies (onshore and offshore
wind, photovoltaic) for network companies, energy suppliers,
large customers, wholesale markets, and government subsidy
programs. Our industry-leading capabilities in project devel-
opment and execution and in operational excellence already
give us a tangible competitive advantage in this business.

Although each of these core businesses is independent and has
its own business logic, combining them in a single company
offers significant advantages. It will enable E.ON to acquire and
leverage a comprehensive understanding of the transformation
of the energy system and the interplay between the individual
submarkets in regional and local energy supply systems. Being
part of the same company will enable these businesses to work
together to design customer-oriented offerings and package
solutions for the new energy world (such as sustainable solutions
for cities), to conduct joint stakeholder management, and to
position the brand more effectively.

In addition to our three core businesses, our portfolio includes
a nuclear power business in Germany, which is not a strategic
business segment for E.ON and is managed by a separate oper-
ating company, PreussenElektra of Hanover. As Germany's
phaseout of nuclear energy moves forward, E.ON will ensure
that its nuclear assets are decommissioned and dismantled
safely and cost-effectively. A solution for the funding of the
intermediate and final storage of nuclear waste is on the horizon.
In December 2016 Germany's two houses of parliament passed
a law to reassign responsibility for the country’s nuclear waste.
The law cannot take effect until the European Commission has
completed a state-aid review. E.ON is obliged to make a consid-
erable contribution, approximately €10 billion, to finance this
solution. In return, the German state will assume responsibility for
the intermediate and final storage of the country's nuclear waste.
E.ON continues to advocate that the law be underpinned by a
contractual agreement in order to ensure lasting legal certainty.

Resources and Capabilities

A focused setup and systematic approach will enable E.ON to
retain its existing strengths and advantages and build on them.
Examples include our success at developing and building an inter-
national renewables portfolio consisting of 4.6 GW of operational
capacity and an attractive development pipeline, our outstanding
record of managing a total of roughly 1 million kilometers of
energy networks, and our direct access to 30 million customers
in key European markets and in Turkey.


--- Page 2 ---

Alongside its existing capabilities and resources, E.ON is devel-
oping and refining the necessary expertise for the key success
factors in its businesses. In particular, we cultivate a strong
customer orientation, develop and implement new downstream
business models and products, and leverage the digital trans-
formation. The successful implementation of our strategy also
depends on partnerships, such as partnerships with providers
of new technology and business models.

Significance for Employees and Stakeholders

E.ON offers attractive opportunities to current and future
employees by creating jobs and career opportunities in growth
markets and by setting clear objectives. It offers investors a
reasonable balance between dividends with good growth pros-
pects, highly predictable earnings, and solid financing.

Transformation

In 2016 E.ON embarked on a journey of transformation. The goal
of this journey is to become a leading company in the new energy
world. In the years ahead, we will therefore place considerable
strategic emphasis on putting the right pieces in place for future
success and growth in a demanding market environment.

Uniper Spinoff

E.ON and Uniper have operated separately as independent com-
panies since January 1, 2016. Diisseldorf-based Uniper has
about 13,000 employees and focuses on the conventional energy
world. It consists of upstream and midstream businesses that
originally belonged to E.ON. At our Annual Shareholders Meeting
on June 8, 2016, E.ON SE shareholders voted to spin off a
53.35-percent majority stake in Uniper, which had a successful
stock-market listing on September 12. Currently, E.ON continues
to have a 46.65-percent stake in Uniper. We intend to divest
our remaining Uniper stake over the medium term. Furthermore,
a Control Termination Agreement was concluded, which took
effect on December 31, 2016, at which time Uniper was decon-
solidated.

Corporate Initiatives

Alongside the demanding spinoff process, we launched three
important corporate initiatives in 2016 in order to enhance our
competitiveness and customer orientation. They will help us lay
the foundation for lasting success in the years ahead. All of them
are designed for rapid results and implementation.

¢ Our focus on the new energy world and our commitment to
put customers at the center of everything we do were the
starting points for our new brand idea ("Let's Create a Better
Tomorrow"). Our new brand positioning aims for a strong
emotional appeal and personality, built on what matters to
our customers: brilliant experiences, giving them more; and
smarter, sustainable solutions. These key brand pillars and
our vibrant new brand design will enable our customer busi-
nesses to be distinctive in our chosen markets. At the end of
2016, our Italy regional unit already adopted our new brand
positioning at the end of 2016. Our other regional units are
following.

¢ Successful digitalization is an integral component of our
strategy, which was appointed a Chief Digital Officer last year.
Under his leadership, we are conducting a Group-wide digital
transformation initiative to explore ideas that will fundamen-
tally improve our customer experience, accelerate process
simplification and automation, as well as enable us to tap new
sources of growth through new and/or disruptive business
models. We have already identified and prioritized the most
promising ideas, which we will validate and implement swiftly
in the months ahead.

¢ Under the project name Phoenix, E.ON is reviewing and opti-
mizing our central functions and costs across the company
in the wake of the Uniper spinoff. Its purpose is to make our
central functions leaner and more customer-oriented so that
we can continue to position ourselves successfully in the face
of keener competition. As a result of Phoenix we intend to
permanently reduce our controllable costs by €400 million.

Corporate Profile

Corporate Profile
Business Model

E.ON is an investor-owned energy company. Led by Group
Management in Essen, our operations are segmented into three
operating units: Energy Networks, Customer Solutions, and
Renewables. Our non-strategic operations are reported under
Non-Core Business.

Group Management

The main task of Group Management is to lead the entire EON
Group by overseeing and coordinating its operating businesses.
This includes charting E.ON's strategic course, defining its
financial policy and initiatives, managing business issues that
transcend individual markets, managing risk, continually opti-
mizing E.ON's business portfolio, and conducting stakeholder
management.

Energy Networks

This segment consists of our power and gas distribution net-
works and related activities. It is subdivided into three regional
markets: Germany, Sweden, and East-Central Europe/Turkey
(which consists of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Slo-
vakia, and Turkey). This segment's main tasks include operating
its power and gas networks safely and reliably, carrying out any
necessary maintenance and repairs, and expanding its networks,
which frequently involves adding customer grid connections.

Customer Solutions

This segment serves as the platform for working with our
customers to actively shape Europe's energy transition. This
includes supplying customers in Europe (excluding Turkey)
with power, gas, and heat as well as with products and services
that enhance their energy efficiency and autonomy and provide
other benefits. Our activities are tailored to the individual needs
of customers across all segments: residential, small and medium-
sized enterprises, large commercial and industrial, and public
entities. E.ON’s main presence in this business is in Germany, the
United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
and Romania. E.ON Connecting Energies, which provides cus-
tomers with turn-key distributed energy solutions, is also part
of this segment.

22

Renewables

This segment consists of Onshore Wind/Solar and Offshore
Wind/Other. We plan, build, operate, and manage renewable
generation assets. We market their output in several ways:

in conjunction with renewable incentive programs, under long-
term electricity supply agreements with key customers, and
directly to the wholesale market.

Non-Core Business

This segment consists of our non-strategic operations, in par-
ticular the operation of our nuclear power stations in Germany
(which is managed by our PreussenElektra unit) and, effective
January 1, 2016, our stake in the Uniper Group which we
account for using the equity method. Uniper's earnings are
reported under non-operating earnings.

New Features in Our Reporting

In view of our new strategy and the Annual Shareholders
Meeting's vote to spin off Uniper, we applied IFRS 5 and report
the Uniper Group as a discontinued operation. We therefore
adjusted our 2016 and 2015 numbers, with the exception of
our total assets and liabilities in 2015, to exclude Uniper and no
longer provide commentary on its business performance. After
the Control Termination Agreement took effect, Uniper was
deconsolidated effective December 31, 2016, and is recorded
in our Consolidated Financial Statements as an associated
company in accordance with our stake and accounted for using
the equity method.


--- Page 6 ---

Management System

Our corporate strategy aims to deliver sustainable growth in
shareholder value. We have put in place a Group-wide planning
and controlling system to assist us in planning and managing
E.ON as a whole and our individual businesses with an eye to
increasing their value. This system ensures that our financial
resources are allocated efficiently. We strive to enhance our
sustainability performance efficiently and effectively as well.
We have high expectations for our sustainability performance.
We embed these expectations progressively more deeply into
our organization—across all of our businesses, entities, and
processes and along the entire value chain—by means of binding
company policies and minimum standards.

Our main key figures for managing our operating business are
adjusted EBIT and cash-effective investments. Other key figures
for managing the E.ON Group—alongside adjusted net income,
and earnings per share (based on adjusted net income)—are
cash-conversion rate and ROCE.

In April 2016 the E.ON Management Board decided that adjusted
earnings before interest and taxes (“adjusted EBIT") will super-
sede adjusted EBITDA as E.ON's most important key figure for
indicating its businesses’ long-term earnings power. The E.ON
Management Board is convinced that adjusted EBIT is the most
suitable key figure for assessing operating performance because
it presents a business's operating earnings independently of non-
operating factors, interest, and taxes. The adjustments include
net book gains, cost-management and restructuring expenses,
impairment charges, and other operating earnings, which include,
among other items, the marking to market of derivatives (see
the explanatory information on pages 37 and 38 of the Com-
bined Group Management Report and in Note 33 of the Consol-
idated Financial Statements).

Cash-effective investments are equal to the investment expen-
ditures shown in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Cash-conversion rate is equal to our operating cash flow before
interest and taxes divided by adjusted EBITDA. It indicates
whether our operating earnings are generating enough liquidity.

Return on capital employed (ROCE") assesses the value perfor-
mance of our operating business. ROCE is a pretax total return on
capital and is defined as the ratio of our EBIT to annual average
capital employed.

Adjusted net income is an earnings figure after interest income,
income taxes, and non-controlling interests that has been adjusted
to exclude non-operating effects. Also excluded are non-
operating interest expense/income, taxes on operating earnings,
and non-controlling interests’ share of operating earnings.

E.ON manages its capital structure by means of its debt factor
(see the section entitled Finance Strategy on page 39). Debt
factor is equal to our economic net debt divided by our adjusted
EBITDA and is therefore a dynamic debt metric. Economic net
debt includes our net financial debt as well as our pension and
asset-retirement obligations.

Alongside our most important financial management key
figures, this Combined Group Management Report includes
other financial and non-financial key performance indicators
("KPls") to highlight aspects of our business performance and
our sustainability performance vis-a-vis all our stakeholders:
our employees, customers, shareholders, bond investors, and the
countries in which we operate. Operating cash flow, and value
added are examples of our other financial KPIs. Among the KPIs
of our sustainability performance are our carbon emissions
and TRIF (which measures reported work-related injuries and
illnesses). The sections entitled Corporate Sustainability and
Employees contain explanatory information about these KPIs.
However, these KPIs are not the focus of the ongoing manage-
ment of our businesses.

Corporate Profile

Innovation

In 2016 we regrouped our innovation activities to reflect the
spinoff of Uniper from E.ON. Projects relating to conventional
energy were transferred to Uniper, those relating to nuclear
energy to PreussenElektra. E.ON now has the following Innova-
tion Hubs:

« Retail and end-customer solutions: develop new business
models for distributed-energy supply, energy efficiency, and
mobility

« Renewables generation: increase the cost-effectiveness of
existing wind and solar assets and study new renewables
technologies

« Infrastructure and energy networks: develop energy-storage
and energy-distribution solutions for an increasingly decen-
tralized and volatile generation system

¢ Energy intelligence and energy systems: study potentially
fundamental changes to energy systems and the role of data
in the new energy world

Strategic Co-Investments

We support our effort to develop customer-centric and innova-
tive technologies and business models by identifying promising
energy technologies of the future that will enhance our palette
of offerings for our millions of customers around Europe and will
make us a pacesetter in the operation of smart energy systems.
We select new businesses that offer the best opportunities for
partnerships, commercialization, and equity investments. Our
investments focus on strategic technologies and business models
that enhance our ability to lead the move to distributed, sus-
tainable, and innovative energy offerings. These arrangements
benefit new technology companies and E.ON, since we gain
access to their innovations and have a share in the value growth.

24

In 2016 our investments included Kite Power Solutions, a British
company that is developing a solution to harness the energy of
the wind using kites (which soar at altitudes of up to 450 meters)
instead of ground-based rotors. We reinvested in two companies
that have shown a positive development since the beginning our
partnership with them in 2014: Berlin-based Thermondo (which
is a pacesetter in the digitalization of home heating installation)
and California-based AutoGrid (which brings intelligent data
management to the distributed energy world).

Sample Projects from 2016

Customer Solutions

In the United Kingdom we worked with Enervee, a U.S.-based
company that is one of our strategic co-investments, to develop
an online platform for the British market called E.ON Market-
place. Consumers can use the E.ON Marketplace to compare the
energy efficiency of household goods and consumer electronics.

In Germany we developed Impuls KW, a new mobile application
for tablets and smart phones that enables customers to monitor
the performance of their distributed generating units with one-
click simplicity. It features an easy-to-read display of technical
and economic data, including energy consumption, fuel costs, peak
demand, economic efficiency, and various types of emissions.


--- Page 8 ---

In Hungary we developed an energy container that can provide
round-the-clock, fossil-free electricity to customers whose
homes are remote from the grid, thereby eliminating the need
for costly grid extensions. Electricity from the containers roof-
top solar panels can either be consumed immediately or stored
in batteries. If the batteries are fully charged, the surplus elec-
tricity powers electrolysis equipment that produces hydrogen
which is stored in gas cylinders outside the container. At night
or on cloudy days, customers draw their electricity from the
batteries or a hydrogen-powered fuel cell. The container, which
is equipped with remote surveillance and monitoring, can gen-
erate enough electricity to meet the average residential demand
(4,000 kWh per year), can store up to 15 days of backup elec-
tricity, and is nearly 100 percent reliable.

Renewables

We developed and rolled out an end-to-end mobile asset man-
agement system that can be used online and offline. The new
digital tool for wind asset maintenance overcomes the practical
limitations of the existing desktop system and also reduces the
number of paper-based processes.

Distribution Networks

As part of our effort to meet the challenges of a low-carbon,
sustainable energy system, we selected Simris, a small commu-
nity in southeast Sweden, to test a small offgrid energy system.
One business and 160 households will take part in the trial and
use energy from local renewable sources. Simris already has

a wind farm and solar panels. A battery will now be installed to

store surplus wind and solar power, providing a source of reserve
power. This will enable the participants in the trial to disconnect
themselves from the grid for certain periods of time. The trial is

expected to start in the first half of 2017 and last three years.

University Support

Our innovation activities include partnering with universities
and research institutes to conduct research projects in a variety
of areas. Our flagship partnership is with the E.ON Energy
Research Center ("ERC") at RWTH Aachen University in Germany.
In 2016 we decided to continue this successful partnership
and therefore extended our agreement with the university for
another five years. The main purpose of the partnership is to
study ways to expand the horizons of energy conservation and
sustainable energy and to draw on this research to develop
new offerings and solutions for customers. The ERC's research
focuses on renewables, technologically advanced electricity
networks, and efficient technology for buildings.

Business Report

Macroeconomic and Industry Environment

Macroeconomic Environment

Global economic growth was again weak—3.1 percent, according
to an OECD estimate—in 2016. The OECD noted a reduction in
private and public investment activity worldwide.

The U.S. economy was on a stable growth path in 2016, partic-
ularly in the second half of the year. Growth was supported by
private consumption and private investment, which were bolstered
by a labor market almost at full employment. China's economic
growth rate declined further in 2016, which the OECD ascribes
to the fact that the country's growth drivers have shifted from
investment to consumption and services.

The euro zone continued its monetary and fiscal policies of recent
years. Nevertheless, there was only a moderate improvement

in domestic demand, which was driven by private consumption.
Thanks to this robust domestic demand, Germany's gross domes-
tic product ("GDP") growth was barely dampened by the weak
global economic environment. Demand was supported by a solid
labor market and favorable monetary policies.

Italy's growth remained tepid. Economic expansion in Germany's
neighbors to the East was weaker than in the prior year. For
example, the Czech Republic's GDP grew by 2.4 percent, Hungary's
by 1.7 percent.

Turkey's GDP growth rate slowed.

Energy Policy and Regulatory Environment

International

The Paris Agreement on climate protection took effect on
November 4, 2016. It was ratified by 55 UN member states that
together account for at least 55 percent of global carbon emis-
sions. The 22nd United Nations climate change conference took
place in Marrakesh, Morocco, from November 7 to 18, 2016. It
focused on the practical implementation of the Paris Agreement.
Based on scenarios developed by the World Energy Council and
the International Energy Agency, the Paris Agreement's objective
of limiting the increase in global temperatures to under 2 degrees
Celsius can only be reached with greater efforts.

Europe

The energy policy of the European Union ("EU") began to turn more
of its attention to end-customers. The European Commission's
package of measures called Clean Energy for All Europeans aims
to improve energy services for residential customers enabling
them to save money and conserve energy, in particular through
the use of smart technologies.

The EU also intends to remain a pacesetter in renewables and
has set a binding target for renewables to account for at least
27 percent of its energy mix by 2030. In the commission's view,
the package of measures makes the necessary adjustments to
the electricity market design so that in the future large amounts
of wind and solar energy can be fed into the system efficiently.

The EU continues to emphasize the key role distribution system
operators ("DSOs") play in implementing the energy transition
and therefore sees them as important partners in redesigning
the energy system.

In its long-term strategy, the EU strengthened its commitment
to energy efficiency by setting a binding target that the EU must
improve its energy efficiency by 30 percent by 2030 relative to
a 2007 baseline. It emphasized the significance of renewables
for the EU's future energy mix, including more use of renewable
electricity for heat and transport.

Central Eastern Europe

The Czech Republic established its regulations for power and
gas prices for 2016-2018. The country’s regulatory agency
aims to promote cost efficiency and also to spur investment in
networks by providing operators with adequate and stable
returns. As planned, Romania implemented a number of mea-
sures to further liberalize its energy market. In 2016 there was
again a general trend in this region toward government-man-
dated price reductions. Hungary began the process of revising
its ordinances and directives for tariffs, pricing, and network
connections. The revisions under discussion include new method-
ologies for gas and power distribution systems, the regulation
of the electricity prices paid by industrial customers, and elec-
tricity storage devices.

Germany

In 2016 Germany made a number of important energy-policy
decisions roughly one year before the elections to the federal
parliament, which will take place in the autumn of 2017. In the
summer of 2016 it enacted far-reaching amendments to the
Renewable Energy Act, the Electricity Market Act, and the Act on
the Digitalization of the Energy Transition. Support for renew-
ables will now take the form of competitive tenders, including
for offshore wind farms. The Electricity Market Act does not
introduce a capacity market, which had been a topic of much
debate. Instead, it seeks to ensure supply security by bolstering
the current market design, by placing greater responsibilities
on market participants, and by introducing a variety of reserve
mechanisms (network and capacity reserves along with an
on-call reserve of lignite-fired generating units). The Smart
Meters Operation Act, which is part of the Act for the Digitali-
zation of the Energy Transition, sets the timeline and price caps
for the rollout of smart meters and advanced metering technology
to various customer groups.

Besides these laws enacted in the summer of 2016, other
important energy-policy decisions were made in the autumn and
winter of 2016, some of which have significant implications for
DSOs. The amended Incentive Regulation Ordinance took effect
in September 2016. In October the German Federal Network
Agency set the rate of return for power and gas networks for
the third regulatory period. The rate of return for new assets is
only 6.91 percent. Lawmakers also amended the German Energy
Industry Act, which governs how concessions are awarded.
Under one of the amendments, communities may, along with
the existing energy-related criteria, consider “local community
affairs" as a criterion for awarding concessions.

To comply with European law, in the autumn of 2016 Germany
amended its Combined-Heat-and Power ("CHP") Act and again
amended the Renewable Energy Act. As with renewables,
competitive tenders will be introduced for CHP units between
1 and 50 MW. The reduced 20 percent surcharge for renewable
power now must also be paid on an operator's own consumption
from upgraded existing assets, which were previously exempted
from the surcharge. Finally, an experimentation clause was
added to the German Energy Industry Act to make it possible
to conduct trials of research projects in sector-coupling that
are part of the Smart Energy Showcases: Digital Agenda for the
Energy Transition.

Italy

The Italian Regulatory Authority for Electricity, Gas, and Water
wants to spur competition in the end-customer market and
intends to supplant regulated tariffs.

Sweden

Sweden's Energy Policy Commission developed a long-term
strategy for the country’s energy supply through 2050. It pre-
sented its findings at the start of 2017. Renewables and energy
efficiency will play important roles in this strategy. In addition,
the Swedish government has an interest in enhancing consumers’
rights in the energy marketplace. This includes energy services
such as flexible demand, energy efficiency, and self-generation
of energy.

Turkey

Turkey amended its electricity market legislation in 2016. These
changes included the designation of zones in which renewables
will receive preferential dispatch.

United Kingdom

The government announced in 2013 that the Competition and
Markets Authority ("CMA") would conduct an annual investiga-
tion of the state of competition in Britain. The CMA presented
its first report at the end of 2016. Its primary focus in the
energy sector was on retail electricity and gas markets for end-
customers. The CMA's proposed remedies are aimed primarily
at enhancing customer activity and engagement (for example,
by increasing transparency) and at increasing competition. The
government is crafting legislation to implement the remedies.

USA

The United States provides support for renewables primarily
through tax credits, such as production tax credits for wind and
investment tax credits for solar.

Business Report

Earnings Situation

Business Performance in 2016

In the 2016 financial year our operating business performed in
line with our expectations. Our sales declined by 11 percent
year on year to €38.2 billion. Adjusted EBIT in our core business
declined by about €0.1 billion to €2.5 billion. The principal posi-
tive effect in our operating business was higher earnings at
Renewables due to the fact that Amrumbank West and Humber
Gateway wind farms were for the first time fully operational for
the entire year. These effects were more than offset by lower
earnings at Energy Networks resulting from the non-recurrence
of positive one-off items recorded in the prior-year.

Adjusted EBIT for the E.ON Group declined by €451 million to
€3.1 billion (if disposals are factored out, adjusted EBIT was
€85 million below the prior-year figure). Adjusted net income
declined by €172 million to €904 million. Our adjusted EBIT
and adjusted net income were therefore at the upper end of our
forecast range of €2.7 to €3.1 billion and €0.6 to €1 billion,
respectively. In addition, we recorded a cash-conversion rate
of 80 percent, which is equal to operating cash flow before
interest and taxes (€3,974 million) divided by adjusted EBITDA
(€4,939 million). Our ROCE was 10.4 percent.

Our investments of €3.2 billion were slightly below the prior-
year figure but in line with the €3.4 billion foreseen for 2016 in
our medium-term plan.

Our operating cash flow of €3 billion was significantly below
the prior-year figure of €4.2 billion, primarily because of higher
net tax payments and the disposal of the E&P business.

28

Acquisitions, Disposals, and Discontinued Operations in 2016
We executed the following significant transactions in 2016.
Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains
detailed information about them.

Disposal Groups, Assets Held for Sale, and Discontinued
Operations

To implement our new strategy, through year-end 2016 we
classified as disposal groups, assets held for sale, or discontinued
operations:

¢ Uniper Group, which was spun off

¢ our E&P business in the North Sea

¢ our stake in Enovos International

¢ our stake in Latvijas Gaze

¢ the network connection for Humber Gateway wind farm.

Disposals resulted in cash-effective items totaling €836 million
in 2016 (prior year: €4,305 million).

Sales

Our sales of €38.2 billion were about €4.5 billion below the prior-
year level. Sales declined by €3.2 billion at Customer Solutions,
by €1.6 billion at Corporate Functions/Other, and by €0.8 billion
at Non-Core Business. The transfer of Uniper's wholesale cus-
tomers in Germany at the end of 2015 and lower sales prices,
the decommissioning of Grafenrheinfeld nuclear power station,
and the expiration of supply contracts at PreussenElektra were
the main reasons for the decline. In addition, the prior-year figure
includes E&P operations in the North Sea and generation opera-
tions in Italy and Spain that have since been divested; these items
are reported under Corporate Functions/Other.

Other Line Items from the Consolidated Statements of Income
Own work capitalized of €529 million surpassed the prior-year
figure of €510 million. The increase is predominantly attributable
to own work capitalized in conjunction with the completion of
IT projects and network investments.

Other operating income rose by 18 percent, from €6,337 million
to €7,448 million, primarily because income from currency-trans-
lation effects increased by €1,143 million, from €3,894 million
to €5,039 million. In addition, income from derivative financial
instruments rose from €524 million to €1,141 million. By con-
trast, income from the sale of current securities and from

cost passthroughs declined. Corresponding amounts resulting
from currency-translation effects and from derivative financial
instruments are recorded under other operating expenses.

Costs of materials decreased by 3 percent, from €33,184 million
to €32,325 million. A significant decline in our procurement
costs for power and gas was matched by a similar decline in our
sales. This was partially offset by an increase in costs of materials
in the fourth quarter resulting from an increase in provisions

for nuclear waste management following the German federal
government's adoption of the recommendations of the Commis-
sion for Organizing and Financing the Nuclear Energy Phaseout.

As anticipated, personnel costs of €2,839 million were below
the prior-year figure of €2,995 million due to a lower average
headcount.

Depreciation charges on continuing operations declined by
€1,846 million, from €5,669 million to €3,823 million. The
significant decline resulted primarily from the non-recurrence
of impairment charges recorded in the prior year along with
the sale of our U.K. and Norwegian E&P operations. This was
partially offset by an increase in depreciation charges following

Germany's enactment of a law to reassign responsibility for the
country's nuclear waste. The impairment charges on our Uniper
stake in the amount of €7 billion, which were necessary in order
to reflect Uniper's lower market capitalization, are disclosed
under discontinued operations. They were recorded principally
in earlier quarters.

Other operating expenses of €7,867 million were slightly below
the prior-year level of €7,968 million. Expenditures relating to
currency-translation effects surpassed the prior-year figure of
€4,049 million by €876 million but were counteracted by lower
expenditures relating to derivative financial instruments. In
addition, effective 2016 concession fees are no longer recorded
under this line item but rather under costs of materials.

Income from companies accounted for under the equity method
of €285 million was slightly below the prior-year figure of
€295 million. Our remaining Uniper stake is not recognized in
income until the 2017 financial year.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT in our core business declined by €75 million year
on year. Energy Networks’ adjusted EBIT was lower due primarily
to the non-recurrence of positive one-off items recorded in
Germany in 2015. However, it posted higher earnings in East-
Central Europe/Turkey. Customer Solutions’ adjusted EBIT was
at the prior-year level. Although earnings in Germany were lower
due in particular to the non-recurrence of positive one-off items
recorded in 2015, adjusted EBIT in the United Kingdom and at
the Other unit was higher. Renewables’ positive earnings per-
formance was due principally to the fact that Amrumbank West
and Humber Gateway wind farms were for the first time fully
operational for the entire year. Adjusted for special items recorded
in 2015, Adjusted EBIT in our core business was up slightly.

Business Report

Adjusted EBIT for the E.ON Group declined by €451 million,
owing primarily to the items mentioned above in the commentary
on adjusted EBIT in our core businesses and to the absence

of earning streams from divested operations. If these earnings
are factored out, adjusted EBIT for the E.ON Group would be
€85 million below the prior-year figure.

E.ON generates a significant portion of its adjusted EBIT in very
stable businesses. Regulated, quasi-regulated, and long-term
contracted businesses accounted for the overwhelming propor-
tion of our adjusted EBIT in 2016.

Our regulated business consists of operations in which revenues
are largely set by law and based on costs. The earnings on these
revenues are therefore extremely stable and predictable.

Our quasi-regulated and long-term contracted business consists
of operations in which earnings have a high degree of predict-
ability because key determinants (price and/or volume) are largely
set by law or by individual contractual arrangements for the
medium to long term. Examples of such legal or contractual
arrangements include incentive mechanisms for renewables and
the sale of contracted generating capacity.

Our merchant activities are all those that cannot be subsumed
under either of the other two categories.

Business Segments

Energy Networks

Below we report on a number of important non-financial key
figures for this segment, such as power and gas passthrough,
system length, and the number of connections.

Power and Gas Passthrough

Power passthrough was at the prior-year level at all of this seg-
ment's operating units. Gas passthrough rose by 7.9 billion kWh,
or 5 percent.

Power passthrough in Germany in 2016 was at the prior-year
level. Gas passthrough rose by 4 percent, or 4.2 billion kWh,
mainly because of higher sales to large customers due to eco-
nomic growth. In addition, lower temperatures in our network
territory relative to the prior year had a positive impact on sales
to standard-load-profile customers.

Power and gas passthrough in Sweden rose to about 37 bil-
lion kWh and 4.9 billion kWh, respectively, primarily because of
low temperatures at the beginning and end of 2016.

Power passthrough at East-Central Europe/ Turkey was 0.4 bil-
lion kWh above the prior-year level owing to positive economic
development in the Czech Republic. The 3.6 billion kWh increase
in gas passthrough is primarily attributable to regulatory changes
in Hungary.

System Length and Connections

System length in Germany—about 350,000 kilometers for power
and about 58,000 kilometers for gas—was roughly at the prior-
year level. At year-end we had about 5.8 million connection points
for power and about 0.9 million for gas.

The length of our power system in Sweden was roughly
136,400 kilometers at year-end 2016, slightly higher than the
prior-year figure of 135,500 kilometers. The length of the gas
distribution system was unchanged at 2,100 kilometers. The
number of connection points in the power distribution system
was unchanged at roughly 1 million.

System length in East-Central Europe/Turkey—about 232,000 kilo-
meters for power and about 44,000 kilometers for gas—was at
the prior-year level, as were the roughly 4.7 million connection
points for power and the roughly 1.3 million for gas.

Sales and Adjusted EBIT
This segment's sales rose by €0.9 billion, whereas its adjusted
EBIT declined by €140 million.

Sales rose by €0.9 billion in Germany, primarily because of
higher sales in conjunction with the REL. REL compensation to
generators in our service territory totaled about €7.7 billion,
€0.5 billion more than in 2015. The rise is mainly attributable
to increases in installed generating capacity and in the amount
of electricity fed into our distribution networks. For distribution

network operators, however, REL compensation is passed
through and therefore is not recorded in income. Sales also
increased owing to higher gas passthrough. This operating unit's
adjusted EBIT declined by €235 million to €894 million, primarily
because of the absence of positive one-off effects recorded in
2015 (the reversal of provisions for network risks along with
special items in income from equity interests). Higher depreciation
charges are mainly attributable to higher investments.

Sales in Sweden were slightly higher due to volume factors.
Adjusted EBIT was significantly higher thanks to an improved
gross margin in the power business. In addition, earnings in the
first half of 2015 were adversely affected by costs in conjunction
with storm damage.

Sales in East-Central Europe/Turkey were €35 million below
the prior-year level. Although sales in Romania and the Czech
Republic declined owing mainly to tariff effects, adjusted EBIT
rose by €25 million. Adjusted EBIT was higher in the Czech
Republic due to improved margins and cost savings. Our equity
stakes in Turkey and the Slovak Republic contributed to the
earnings increase as well. Adjusted EBIT in Romania declined
significantly because of tariff effects in the power and gas busi-
nesses. This was partially offset by an increase in gas passthrough.
Earnings in Hungary were lower due to regulation-driven
impairment charges in the gas network and higher costs, which
were only partially offset by lower network losses.

Power and Gas Sales Volume
In 2016 this segment's power and gas sales declined by
3.8 billion kWh and 23.9 billion kWh, respectively.

Customer Solutions’ power sales in Germany were at the prior-
year level. Power sales to residential and small and medium
enterprise ("SME") customers were lower due in to part to keen
competition but mainly to a reduction in average consumption
and to keen competition. In particular, this reduction reflects
technical improvements such as energy-efficient appliances as
well as more consumption-conscious consumer behavior. Power
sales to industrial and commercial ("I&C") customers and to sales
partners declined, primarily because of the transfer of EON
Energie Deutschland's wholesale customers to Uniper Energy
Sales at the end of 2015. Power sales to the wholesale market
rose significantly owing to Uniper Energy Sales for its wholesale
customers and resales to Uniper Global Commodities. Gas sales
volume declined by 14 percent, mainly because sales to 1&C cus-
tomers and sales partners were lower due to the above-mentioned
transfer of wholesale customers. By contrast, gas sales to resi-
dential and SME customers were slightly higher due to weather
factors, and wholesale gas sales were significantly higher thanks
to the deliveries to Uniper for its wholesale customers.

Power sales in the United Kingdom declined by 4.1 billion kWh.
Declining customer numbers and customers’ energy-saving
behavior led to lower power sales to residential and SME custom-
ers. A reduction in the number of customer facilities served along
with lower offtake were the reasons for the decline in power
sales to 1&C customers. Gas sales decreased by 3 billion kWh.
Lower customer numbers were responsible for the reduction in
gas sales to residential and SME customers. The reason for the
decline in gas sales to 1&C customers is the same as for power.

Other's power sales (Sweden, Hungary, the Czech Republic,
Romania, Italy) and E.ON Connecting Energies were up slightly.
By contrast, its gas sales declined by 10.4 billion kWh, mainly
because of a new strategy for the residential-customer business
in Hungary and lower sales volume to wholesale customers in
the Czech Republic.

Customer Numbers

This segment had about 21.4 million customers at year-end 2016,
less than the prior-year figure of 22.7 million. The number of
customers in the United Kingdom declined from 7.6 to 7 million;
power customers account for about 60 percent of customer
losses, gas customers for about 40 percent. Customer numbers
in Hungary declined from 3.1 billion in 2015 to 2.5 billion in
2016 as a result of the above-mentioned new strategy. In Ger-
many they decreased from 6.2 million in 2015 to 6.1 million in
2016. A high level of acquisitions nearly offset customer losses
in a keenly competitive marketplace.

Sales and Adjusted EBIT
This segment's sales decreased by €3.2 billion in 2016, whereas
its adjusted EBIT was slightly above the prior-year level.

Sales in Germany declined, primarily because of the transfer of
E.ON Energie Deutschland's wholesale customers to Uniper
Energy Sales at the end of 2015. Adjusted EBIT was 42 percent
lower. The decline is primarily attributable to the non-recurrence
of positive one-off effects recorded in the prior year (primarily
settlement-related items from previous reporting periods).
Earnings were also adversely affected by higher customer-acqui-
sition costs, higher Renewable Energy Law levies, higher network
fees, a slight decline in average power consumption, and costs
for the further buildup of the customer-solutions business.

Currency-translation effects, lower sales volume, declining cus-
tomer numbers, and a reduction in gas prices in January caused
sales in the United Kingdom to decline by €1.9 billion. Adjusted
EBIT increased by €87 million primarily owing to lower costs

in conjunction with government-mandated energy-efficiency
measures.


--- Page 17 ---

Business Report

Other's sales declined by €0.6 billion, primarily because of lower
sales volume and prices in the power and gas business in Hungary
and the Czech Republic along with the sale of an equity interest
in our gas business in Italy in July 2015. By contrast, sales in
Sweden rose owing to lower temperatures. Other's adjusted

and gas margins and improved receivables management, Hungary
from its new strategy for the residential-customer business and
improved power and gas margins, and Sweden from improved
margins in the heat businesses along with lower temperatures.
Improved margins in the Czech Republic also had a positive
impact on earnings.

capacity of 4,176 MW and attributable generating capacity of
4,574 MW were both 5 percent above the corresponding figures

Fully Consolidated and Attributable Generating Capacity

reasons for the increase were the commissioning of Colbeck's

Power Generation and Sales Volume
This segment's owned generation rose by 1.2 billion kWh in 2016.

Onshore Wind/Solar's generation was 0.5 billion kWh higher.
Unfavorable wind conditions led to lower output in the United
Kingdom, Sweden, and Poland. This was more than offset by
higher output in Italy and positive effects from the commission-
ing of Colbeck's Corner wind farm in the United States in May
2016. Unplanned outages constituted the main reason why the
availability ratio of 94.2 percent in 2016 was below the prior-
year figure of 95.8 percent.

Offshore Wind/Other's generation was 0.7 billion kWh higher,
mainly because Amrumbank West wind farm in the German
North Sea and Humber Gateway wind farm in the U.K. North
Sea were in operation during the year. Amrumbank West did
not enter service until October 2015, and Humber Gateway
was only in operation for five months in 2015. The availability
ratio of 96.7 percent in 2016 surpassed the prior-year figure of
94.5 percent, primarily because of a reduction in outages at
Robin Rigg and an improved performance at Amrumbank West
and Humber.

Sales and Adjusted EBIT

This segment's 2016 sales were €124 million below the prior-
year figure, whereas its adjusted EBIT surpassed the prior-year
figure by €39 million.

Onshore Wind/Solar's sales and adjusted EBIT decreased pri-
marily owing to declining prices across all regions and lower

output in Europe. In addition, prior-year adjusted EBIT benefited
from book gains and a positive one-off effect.

Offshore Wind/Other's sales and adjusted EBIT rose by €105 mil-
lion and €136 million, respectively, mainly because Amrumbank
West and Humber Gateway wind farms were, for the first time,
in operation for the entire year and because of proceeds from
asset sales.

Business Report

Non-Core Business (PreussenElektra)

Below we report on a number of important non-financial key
figures for this segment, such as generating capacity, power
generation, and power sales volume.

Fully Consolidated and Attributable Generating Capacity
The segment's fully consolidated and attributable generating
capacity remained unchanged at 4,471 MW and 4,129 MW,
respectively.

Power Generation and Sales Volume

This segment's power procured (owned generation and pur-
chases) declined by 10.7 billion kWh year on year. The reduction
in owned generation is principally attributable to the fact that
Grafenrheinfeld nuclear power station produced power for part
of the prior year (until its decommissioning at the end of June
2015) and to unplanned production outages at Grohnde nuclear
power station due to a damaged secondary cooling pump and
repairs to a sensor line. The expiration of delivery contracts to
Belgium, the Netherlands, and France led to a reduction in
power procurement in 2016. Owned generation in the fourth
quarter of 2016 increased slightly (by 0.4 billion kWh) because
Grohnde nuclear power station had been decommissioned, as
planned, in October 2015.

The decline in power sales resulted chiefly from a reduction in
owned generation and in marketable power procurement due to
the expiration of supply contracts in Belgium, the Netherlands,
and France.

Sales and Adjusted EBIT

The significant decline in this segment's sales (-€752 million)
mainly reflects lower sales prices, the decommissioning of
Grafenrheinfeld nuclear power station at the end of June 2015,
and the expiration of deliveries to Belgium, the Netherlands,
and France.

Adjusted EBIT was €10 million lower, principally because of
the absence of earnings streams from Grafenrheinfeld and
lower sales prices. Lower expenditures for the nuclear-fuel tax
had a positive impact on adjusted EBIT in 2016, as did the
non-recurrence of adverse effects recorded in 2015 in conjunc-
tion with an arbitration procedure. Fourth-quarter adjusted
EBIT improved by €93 million because lower sales prices in the
fourth quarter were more than offset by positive effects in
conjunction with the nuclear-fuel tax and the non-recurrence of
adverse effects recorded in 2015 in conjunction with an arbi-
tration procedure.

We recorded a net loss of €16 billion in 2016 compared with a
net loss of €6.4 billion in 2015. This substantial negative figure
is primarily attributable to a loss from discontinued operations,
which principally reflects impairment charges on Uniper opera-
tions and Uniper's realized loss in conjunction with the decon-
solidation of Uniper. In addition, we recorded negative items in
conjunction with the law Germany's two houses of parliament
passed in December 2016 to reassign responsibility for the
country’s nuclear waste. By contrast, adjusted net income, which
does not include non-operating effects, totaled €0.9 billion,
which was just €0.2 billion below the prior-year figure. The
decline is mainly attributable to the non-recurrence of positive
one-off effects and the absence of earnings streams from
divested operations.

The net loss attributable to shareholders of E.ON SE of -€8.5 bil-
lion and corresponding earnings per share of -€4.33 were below
the respective prior-year figures of -€7 billion and -€3.60.

The 2016 figure is after the completion of the Uniper spinoff.

Pursuant to IFRS, income/loss from discontinued operations,
net, is reported separately in the Consolidated Statements of
Income and includes Uniper's earnings until derecognition
(-€14.1 billion). The significant loss reported is mainly attributable
to impairment charges recorded primarily in previous quarters,

provisions for contingent losses, and Uniper's realized loss in
conjunction with the deconsolidation of Uniper. The line item
also includes the earnings of the Spain regional unit (2016:
€0.2 billion). Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
contains more information about these matters.

We had a tax expense of €0.4 billion compared with €0.7 billion
in the prior-year period. Despite our negative earnings before
taxes, we incurred a tax expense and consequently had a negative
tax rate of 25 percent (prior year: 49 percent). Expenditures
that do not reduce taxes and significant effects resulting from
the change in the value of deferred tax assets in 2016 were the
main reasons for the change in our tax rate.

Net book gains were €358 million below the prior-year figure.
In 2016 a book gain on the sale of securities was more than
offset by a book loss on the sale of our U.K. E&P business. The
prior-year figure includes book gains on the sale of securities,
the remaining stake in Energy from Waste, operations in Italy,
the E&P business in the Norwegian North Sea, and network
segments in Germany.

Restructuring and cost-management expenditures declined by
€100 million and, as in the prior year, resulted mainly from cost-
cutting programs and the implementation of our new strategy.

Business Report

We use derivatives to shield our operating business from price
fluctuations. Marking to market of derivatives at December 31,
2016, resulted in a positive effect of €932 million (prior year:
-€134 million). The change is mainly attributable to Customer
Solutions.

Impairment charges in 2016 were recorded in particular on
Renewables’ operations in the United States and Italy, Customer
Solutions’ assets in the United Kingdom, and Energy Networks’
gas-storage capacity in Germany. In the prior year we recorded
impairment charges primarily at our nuclear energy business in
Germany, at Renewables, and at E&P operations in the North
Sea and generation operations in Italy that have since been sold.

Other non-operating earnings in 2016 mainly reflected items
in conjunction with the law Germany's two houses of parliament
passed in December 2016 to reassign responsibility for the
country's nuclear waste; these items, along with the related
impairment charges, are fully included here. Other non-operating
earnings in 2015 includes numerous small positive and negative
effects, such as impairment charges on securities.

Adjusted Net Income

38

Adjusted Net Income

Like EBIT, net income also consists of non-operating effects, such
as the marking to market of derivatives. Adjusted net income

is an earnings figure after interest income, income taxes, and
non-controlling interests that has been adjusted to exclude
non-operating effects. In addition to the marking to market of
derivatives, the adjustments include book gains and book losses
on disposals, restructuring expenses, other material non-oper-
ating income and expenses (after taxes and non-controlling
interests), and interest expense/income not affecting net income,
which consists of the interest expense/income resulting from
non-operating effects. Adjusted net income also does not include
income/loss from discontinued operations.

The E.ON Management Board uses this figure in conjunction
with its dividend policy. The goal for the 2016 financial year was
to pay out to E.ON shareholders 40 to 60 percent of adjusted
net income as dividends.

Financial Situation

E.ON presents its financial condition using, among other financial
measures, economic net debt, debt factor, and operating cash flow.

Finance Strategy

Our finance strategy focuses on E.ON's capital structure. Ensuring
that E.ON's access to capital markets is commensurate with its
debt level is at the forefront of this strategy.

With our target capital structure we aim to sustainably secure a
strong BBB/Baa rating.

We manage E.ON's capital structure using our debt factor, which
is equal to our economic net debt divided by adjusted EBITDA;
it is therefore a dynamic debt metric. Economic net debt includes
not only our financial liabilities but also our provisions for pen-
sions and asset-retirement obligations.

The interest-rate environment at the balance-sheet date led in
some cases to negative real interest rates on asset-retirement
obligations. As a result, our provisions exceed the amount of our
asset-retirement obligations as they stood at year-end 2016
without factoring in discounting and cost-escalation effects.
This limits the relevance of our economic net debt as a key figure.
We want economic net debt to continue to serve as a useful
key figure that aptly depicts our debt situation. In the case of
material provisions affected by negative real interest rates, we
henceforth use the aforementioned actual amount of the obli-
gation instead of the balance-sheet figure to calculate our eco-
nomic net debt.

Germany's two houses of parliament enacted a law to fund the
country's phaseout of nuclear energy. This altered the nature
and scope of E.ON's remaining nuclear asset-retirement obliga-
tions. In addition, the deconsolidation of Uniper led to substantial
changes in our debt line items. The comparability of our 2016
and 2015 economic net debt is therefore limited. In view of these
structural changes, it did not make sense to adjust the prior-year
figures. Consequently, we apply our new methodology effective
January 1, 2016, and have left the prior-year figures unadjusted.

We aim to reduce our debt factor to about 4 over the medium
term.

Economic Net Debt

The comparability of our economic net debt in 2016 and 2015 is
subject to a number of significant restrictions. First, the spinoff
and deconsolidation of Uniper significantly reduced the amount
of several line items of our Consolidated Balance Sheets, in
particular our net financial position. Second, the accounting
treatment of the measures to fund Germany's nuclear energy
phaseout involved a revaluation of the remaining provisions
and a substantial increase in asset-retirement obligations due
to the inclusion of the risk surcharge.

These and other factors led to a net financial position of approx-
imately just €0.9 billion at year-end 2016. By contrast, the pro-
visions included in our economic net debt rose by €2.3 billion
owing to the above-described revaluation of these provisions.

This figure is not the same as the asset-retirernent obligations shown in our Consolidated
Balance Sheet (€22,515 milion). This is because we calculate our economic net debt in part
based on the actual amount of our obligations with reasons for this being explained above.
2Not adjusted for Uniper; figure as reported in the 2015 Annual Report.

Funding Policy and Initiatives

The key objective of our funding policy is for E.ON to have access
to a variety of financing sources at all times. We achieve this
objective by basing our funding policy on the following principles.
First, we use a variety of markets and debt instruments to max-
imize the diversity of our investor base. Second, we issue bonds
with terms that give our debt portfolio a balanced maturity
profile. Third, we combine large-volume benchmark issues with
smaller issues that take advantage of market opportunities as

they arise. In the past, external funding was generally carried out
by our Dutch finance subsidiary, E.ON International Finance B.V.
("EIF"), under guarantee of E.ON SE or by E.ON SE itself, and the
funds were subsequently on-lent in the Group. E.ON issued no
new bonds in 2016.

Includes private placements.

With the exception of a U.S.-dollar-denominated bond issued in
2008, all of E.ON SE and E.ON International Finance B.V's cur-
rently outstanding bonds were issued under our Debt Issuance
Program ("DIP"). The DIP enables us to issue debt to investors
in public and private placements. It was last extended for one
year in April 2015 with a total volume of €35 billion, of which
about €9.7 billion was utilized at year-end 2016. After the DIP
expired in April 2016 we did not extend it because of the Uniper
spinoff. E.ON SE intends to renew the DIP in 2017.

In addition to our DIP, we have a €10 billion European Commer-
cial Paper ("CP") program and a $10 billion U.S. CP program
under which we can issue short-term liabilities. We had no CP
outstanding at year-end 2016 (prior year: €0 million).

E.ON also has access to an originally five-year, €5 billion syndi-
cated revolving credit facility, which was concluded with 24 banks
on November 6, 2013, and which includes two options to extend
the facility, in each case for one year. In 2014 E.ON exercised
the first option and extended the facility for one year to 2019. In
2015 E.ON, with the banks’ agreement, postponed until 2016

a possible exercise of the second option to extend the facility for
one more year. We did not exercise this second option. Effective

40

September 13, 2016, we reduced the credit facility from €5 billion
to €3.5 billion in connection with the Uniper spinoff. This facility
has not been drawn on and instead serves as a reliable, ongoing
general liquidity reserve for the E.ON Group. Participation in the
credit facility indicates that a bank belongs to E.ON's core group
of banks.

Alongside financial liabilities, EON has, in the course of its busi-
ness operations, entered into contingencies and other financial
obligations. These include, in particular, guarantees, obligations
from legal disputes and damage claims, current and non-current
contractual, legal, and other obligations. Notes 26, 27, and 31
to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain more infor-
mation about E.ON's bonds as well as liabilities, contingencies,
and other commitments.

Standard & Poor's ("S&P") and Moody's long-term ratings for
E.ON are BBB+ and Baa1, respectively. Moody's downgraded
E.ON's long-term rating from A3 to Baal in March 2015, S&P
from A- to BBB+ in May 2015. In February 2016 both rating
agencies placed E.ON's long-term ratings on review for possible
downgrades. The actions were based on a number of factors,
including a sector-wide review of European utility companies
with exposure to commodity and power price developments.
The decisions were also based on the uncertainties surrounding
the policy discussions on the possible funding of German nuclear
provisions. In May 2016 both S&P and Moody's concluded their
reviews and affirmed their long-term ratings of BBB+ and Baa1,
respectively. The outlook for both ratings is negative. The short-
term ratings are A-2 (S&P) and P-2 (Moody's).

lower than the prior-year level due to a significant reduction in
investments at the East-Central Europe/Turkey reporting unit.
The responsibility for implementing the energy transition in
Germany is shared across society by policymakers and companies,
academics and consumers. The expansion of our distribution
networks provides important support to the energy transition
and contributes substantially to its success. The rapid growth
of renewables makes it necessary to expand and upgrade the
distribution network so that it can accept and transport increased
renewables output. This is the only way to continue to ensure
supply security for energy customers into the future. In 2016
our services territories around Germany again saw an increase
in the number of generating facilities subsidized under the
Renewable Energy Law ("REL"). The number of REL facilities rose
by 3 percent year on year to around 375,000. Installed REL
capacity in our distribution networks increased from 31 GW to
34 GW. The increase in the number of network connections
for REL facilities led to significant construction activity in our
distribution networks. Our Energy Networks segment invested
€846 million in Germany in 2016, significantly more (+6 percent)
than in the prior year. In addition, the connection of new resi-
dential developments led to an increase in customer connections
in Germany in 2016. Investments in Sweden were up slightly.


--- Page 25 ---

Business Report

Customer Solutions invested €49 million more than in the prior-
year period, principally because of higher investments in the
United Kingdom, in Sweden, at E.ON Connecting Energies, and in
the Czech Republic. Investments in the United Kingdom went
toward metering and efficiency projects. Investments in Sweden
served to maintain, upgrade, and expand existing assets as well
as the heat distribution network. The increase in E.ON Connect-
ing Energies’ investments principally reflects the expansion of
its business of providing energy-efficiency solutions to industrial
and commercial customers in Germany and the initial consoli-
dation of a business in Italy. The completion of combined-heat-
and-power units and higher investments in network-services
equipment were among the reasons for the increase in the
Czech Republic.

Investments at Renewables increased by €60 million. Onshore
Wind/Solar's investments rose by €243 million, primarily
because of the completion of a wind farm in the United States.
Offshore/Other's investments declined by €183 million owing
to a reduction in expenditures for new-build projects.

Investments at Non-Core Business (nuclear energy operations
in Germany) were slightly below the prior-year level.

Cash Flow

Our operating cash flow of €3 billion was €1.2 billion below the
prior-year figure of €4.2 billion, primarily because of higher net
tax payments and the absence of cash inflow from the E&P
business, which has now been divested. In addition, an increase
in working capital was only partially offset by countervailing
effects, such as lower interest payments.

4From continuing operations.

Cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations
amounted to around -€3 billion compared with €1.4 billion in
the prior year. Of this -€4.4 billion change, -€3.5 billion resulted
from lower cash inflows from disposals, mainly relating to the
non-recurrence of proceeds on the sale of the business in Spain,
certain operations in Italy (solar, hydro, and conventional gener-
ation), the E&P business in Norway, and the remaining 49-percent
stake in the former E.ON Energy from Waste. Investments were
almost unchanged. We recorded net cash outflows from sale or
purchase of securities, financial liabilities, and fixed investments
of -€0.8 billion compared with +€0.2 billion in 2015.

Cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations
amounted to -€1.2 billion compared with -€3.9 billion in the prior
year. The change of roughly +€2.7 billion is mainly attributable
to a €2.7 billion reduction in the net repayment of financial lia-
bilities. A €0.3 billion increase in the dividend payout to E.ON SE
shareholders was almost entirely offset by net cash inflows
from changes in capital (changes in minority ownership interests
in fully consolidated Group companies).


--- Page 26 ---

Asset Situation

Our asset situation reflects the deconsolidation of Uniper's
operations effective December 31, 2016, which led to a signifi-
cant reduction in our total assets and liabilities relative to year-
end 2015. This affects both our non-current and current assets.
Effective the balance-sheet date, E.ON SE's remaining Uniper
stake is recorded under financial investments as a company
accounted for using the equity method.

Our equity ratio (including non-controlling interests) at year-end
2016 was 2 percent, which is substantially below the year-end
2015 figure of 17 percent. The decline reflects the transfer of
Uniper stock to E.ON shareholders, our net loss, the remeasure-
ment of defined-benefit plans due to lower actuarial interest
rates, and the dividend payout. Our net loss primarily reflects a
loss from discontinued operations of approximately €13.8 billion
and items in the amount of €3.6 billion in conjunction with
Germany's law to reassign responsibility for the country's nuclear

waste. The loss from discontinued operates includes the

€7 billion impairment charge on Uniper's book value to reflect its
lower market capitalization and an additional deconsolidation
loss of €3.6 billion resulting mainly from previously unrealized
currency-translation effects that had been recorded in equity.
The E.ON Group's equity at year-end was €1.3 billion. Equity
attributable to shareholders of E.ON SE was -€1 billion.

Non-current liabilities declined by 36 percent from the figure at
year-end 2015. As on the asset side, the reduction reflects the
deconsolidation of Uniper's operations. In addition, provisions
for the final storage of nuclear waste were reclassified as
non-current liabilities.

Current liabilities declined by 31 percent relative to year-end
2015. The deconsolidation of Uniper's operations was partially
offset by the reclassification of non-current provisions for the
final storage of nuclear waste.

Aa,

E.ON SE is the parent company of the E.ON Group. As such,

its earnings, financial, and asset situation is affected by income
from equity interests. The positive figure recorded for this
item in 2016 reflects, in particular, a withdrawal from the capi-
tal reserves of E.ON Beteiligungen GmbH in the amount of
€3,784 million and a profit transfer of €216 million from E.ON
Iberia Holding GmbH. The main countervailing factors were a
loss transfer of €1,186 million from E.ON Beteiligungen GmbH
and a loss transfer of €722 million from E.ON Energie AG.

E.ON SE und Uniper SE concluded a Spinoff and Takeover
Agreement on April 18, 2016. Under this agreement, E.ON SE
transferred by means of a spinoff its entire ownership interest

in Uniper Beteiligungs GmbH, with all rights and obligations, as
an entirety to Uniper SE in return for the transfer of Uniper SE
stock to E.ON SE shareholders (the transaction was therefore a
spinoff through transfer within the meaning of Section 123,
Paragraph 2, Item 1 of the German Reorganization Act). The
spinoff and stock-market listing of Uniper SE were successfully
concluded in September 2016. As a result, Uniper Beteiligungs
GmbH in the amount of €6,968.6 million was removed from
the line item interest in affiliated companies. The decline in
financial assets principally reflects a withdrawal from the capi-
tal reserves of E.ON Beteiligungen GmbH in the amount of
€4,916 million and an intragroup loan of €1,233 million to
E.ON UK Holding Company Limited.


--- Page 28 ---

Liabilities to affiliated companies at year-end 2016 declined
primarily owing to the spinoff of a majority stake in Uniper
companies and the resulting cancellation of cash-pooling with
these companies and to the conclusion of a transfer-of-control
agreement with Uniper SE and its subsidiaries.

information about treasury shares.

Income taxes shown for 2016 consist mainly of tax income for
previous years. No income taxes were incurred for the 2016
financial year owing to the net loss from a tax perspective.

ment will propose that net income available for distribution be
used to pay a cash dividend of €0.21 per ordinary share. Remain-
ing income available for distribution will be brought forward as
retained earnings.

Management's proposal for the use of net income available for
distribution is based on the number of ordinary shares on
March 13, 2017, the date the Financial Statements of E.ON SE
were prepared. The number of ordinary shares could change
between this date and the date of the Annual Shareholders
Meeting. In this case, the Annual Shareholders Meeting will
be presented with an adjusted proposed resolution for the use
of net income available for distribution. The dividend in the
adjusted proposed resolution will be unchanged at €0.21 per
ordinary share. In this case, however, the total dividend payout
and the amount brought forward as retained earnings will be
adjusted accordingly.

The complete Financial Statements of E.ON SE, with the unquali-
fied opinion issued by the auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers
GmbH, Wirtschaftspriifungsgesellschaft, Diisseldorf, will be
announced in the Bundesanzeiger. Copies are available on
request from E.ON SE and at www.eon.com.

ROCE and Value Added

Cost of Capital

The cost of capital is determined by calculating the weighed-
average cost of equity and debt. This average represents the
market-rate returns expected by stockholders and creditors.
The cost of equity is the return expected by an investor in E.ON
stock. The cost of debt equals the long-term financing terms that
apply in the E.ON Group. The parameters of the cost-of-capital
determination are reviewed on an annual basis.

Our review of the parameters in 2016 led us to adjust our after-
tax cost of capital from 4.9 percent to 4 percent, mainly because
of a lower risk-free interest rate resulting from the persistently
low interest-rate environment. The table below shows the deri-
vation of cost of capital before and after taxes.

Cost of Capital

2016 2015
Risk-free interest rate 0.5% 1.25%
Market premium? 6.75% 6.75%
Debt-free beta factor 0.50 0.52
Indebted beta factor? 0.92 0.90
Cost of equity after taxes 6.70% 7.30%
Average tax rate 31% 27%
Cost of equity before taxes 9.7% 10.0%
Cost of debt before taxes 2.6% 3.4%
Marginal tax rate 31% 27%
Cost of debt after taxes 1.80% 2.40%
Share of equity 45% 50%
Share of debt 55% 50%
Cost of capital after taxes 4.00% 4.90%
Cost of capital before taxes 5.80% 6.70%

{The market premium reflects the higher long-term returns of the stock market compared
with German treasury notes.

"The beta factor is used as an indicator of a stock's relative risk. A beta of more than one
signals a higher risk than the risk level of the overall market; a beta factor of less than one
signals a lower risk.

Analyzing Value Creation by Means of ROCE and Value Added
In 2016 we replaced ROACE with ROCE as key performance
indicator for assessing the value performance of our operating
business. ROCE is a pretax total return on capital and is defined
as the ratio of our EBIT to annual average capital employed.

An important difference between ROCE and ROACE lies in how
they factor in assets. With ROACE, depreciable assets are
recorded at half of their original acquisition or production cost;
with ROCE, depreciable assets are recorded at their book value.

Annual average capital employed represents the interest-bearing
capital invested in our operating business. It is calculated by sub-
tracting non-interest-bearing available capital from non-current
and current operating assets. Goodwill from acquisitions is
included at acquisition cost, as long as this reflects its fair value.
Changes to E.ON's portfolio during the course of the year are
factored into capital employed.

Annual average capital employed does not include the marking
to market of other share investments. The purpose of excluding
this item is to provide us with a more consistent picture of our
ROCE performance.

Value added measures the return that exceeds the cost of capital
employed. It is calculated as follows:

Value added = (ROCE - cost of capital) x annual average capital
employed.


--- Page 30 ---

ROCE Performance in 2016
ROCE declined from 10.9 percent in 2015 to 10.4 percent in

2016, primarily because of the reduction in our adjusted EBIT.

An increase in average capital employed was another factor.
This resulted mainly from the capitalization of costs relating
to dismantling obligations at PreussenElektra. Our ROCE of

10.4 percent was above our pretax cost of capital, which
declined relative to the prior year. This resulted in added value
of €1.4 million.

and their derivation.

2Examples of other non-interest-bearing assets/liabilites include income tax receivables and income taxes as well as receivables and payables relating to derivatives.
°Non-interest-bearing provisions mainly include current provisions, such as those relating to sales and procurement market obligations. They do not include provisions for pensions or for

rnuclear-waste management.

“In order to better depict intraperiod fluctuations in average capital employed, annual average capital employed is calculated as the arithmetic average of the amounts at the beginning of the year

and the end of the year. In 2015 the annual average and the year-end figure were the same.
Adjusted for non-operating effects, discontinued operations, and divested operations.

"ROCE = adjusted EBIT divided by annual average capital employed; for 2015, ROCE = adjusted EBIT divided by annual capital employed.
Value added = (ROACE - cost of capital) x annual average capital employed; for 2015, value added = (ROACE ~ cost of capital) x annual capital employed.

Corporate Sustainability

Many and diverse stakeholders—customers and suppliers,
policymakers and government agencies, employees and trade
unions, nongovernmental organizations and regional interest
groups, equity analysts and investors—have high expectations
of us and the entire energy industry. Their demands include
more renewables and innovative and energy-efficient customer
solutions as well as a diverse workforce and a safe and healthy
workplace. We take these demands seriously and strive system-
atically to make our company more sustainable.

We have conducted a materiality analysis at regular intervals
since 2006. Its purpose is to identify our stakeholders’ expecta-
tions of us. Our annual online Sustainability Report describes
the issues that are material to our stakeholders and to us as a
company as well as how we address these issues. Our reporting
is based on the Global Reporting Initiative's G4 sustainability
reporting guidelines.

We successfully completed our most recent sustainability
work program in 2015. E.ON spun off Uniper in 2016 and now
focuses on renewables, energy networks, and customer solutions.
This transformation makes sustainability a centerpiece of our
corporate strategy, thereby raising stakeholders’ expectations
for us to operate sustainably. To meet these expectations, we

48

revised our sustainability effort. Our objective is to continually
improve our performance and, looking further ahead, to become
one of the leading sustainable companies in our industry. We
therefore defined five main sustainability focus areas for E.ON,
which we describe below under “Highlights in 2016." Each
E.ON unit designs a sustainability improvement plan consisting
of specific measures and targets. The units’ sustainability
improvement plans, the progress toward their respective targets,
and the results of the materiality analysis are presented to,
and discussed by, the Sustainability Governance Council on a
regular basis.

Our commitment to transparency includes subjecting our sus-
tainability performance to independent, detailed assessments by
investors and rating agencies. The results of these assessments
provide important guidance to investors and to us. They help us
identify our strengths and weakness and further improve our
performance. We are therefore very pleased to be listed in the
Multi and Water Utilities category in the 2016 Dow Jones Sus-
tainability Europe Index and World Index; we also earned a
higher score for our economic and environmental performance.
In 2016 we were again included in the RobecoSAM Sustainability
Yearbook and, as a leading company, received a bronze rating.


--- Page 32 ---

In addition, the Carbon Disclosure Project ("CDP") awarded E.ON
a high grade of A- for the quality, processes, and transparency
of our reporting on our carbon emissions and climate change as
well as a grade of B for our corporate water disclosures. The
CDP is one of the world's largest investor organizations. It helps
investors assess whether a company adequately addresses
climate change in its decisions and business processes. Further-
more, E.ON continues to be listed in the Euronext Vigeo Europe
120 sustainability index and, in 2016, was for the first time
included in the Euronext Vigeo World 120.

Highlights in 2016

The purpose of our sustainability activities has long been to
achieve a reasonable balance in addressing environmental,
social, and governance issues. Increasingly, sustainability issues
influence value drivers such as our sales, reputation, attractive-
ness as an employer, efficiency, costs, and innovativeness.

At the start of 2016, we therefore conducted workshops to
articulate what sustainability means for E.ON. The workshops
consisted of more than 60 employees from different depart-
ments and hierarchy levels. We discussed their findings with
external stakeholders. The result is five new focus areas toward
which we will direct our sustainability activities going forward.
These focus areas are consistent with our corporate strategy,
our vision, and our brand.

Business Report

Shared Framework, Individual Implementation

These five focus areas are valid for our entire company. They
serve as the starting point for all E.ON units and functions to
design their own measures and set their own targets. The units
and functions also factor in other sustainability issues that are
important for their respective activities. For example, our pro-
curement organization develops measures that promote sus-
tainable supply chain management and embeds sustainability
key performance indicators into its management model.

The same applies to our PreussenElektra subsidiary. It too will
design its own sustainability improvement plan to address our
sustainability focus areas by, for example, developing measures
to ensure the continued protection of the environment and of
its employees’ health and safety.

Carbon Emissions

Following the transfer to Uniper SE of entities that operate
fossil-fueled generating units, our carbon emissions from power
and heat production totaled 1.2 million metric tons in 2016.
As in the prior year, we included all combustion plants covered
by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (plants with a capacity
of more than 20 MW). Due to the spinoff, which was part of
our new strategy, a comparison with the prior-year figure of
76.8 million metric tons would have no informational value.

Our 2016 Sustainability Report, which will be published online in

early May, will contain detailed information about our emissions.

This report is not part of the Combined Group Management
Report.

Employees

People-Strategy

An organization's business strategy and its products and
services can be copied. What cannot be easily copied are an
organization's people, its culture, and its capabilities. The
successful delivery of any business strategy depends on an
organization having available highly qualified and motivated
employees as well as a strong and diverse talent pipeline.

50

Great companies execute their People Strategy with the same
energy and determination they apply to the business strategy.
Akey success factor is for HR functions to be business-integrated.

The One2two project led to changes in E.ON's organizational
setup. Other changes have resulted from E.ON’s focus on the
new energy world. In response, we decided to review the basic
structure of our People Strategy and to identify any modifications
that might be necessary.

For this purpose, our HR team conducted a survey and an analysis
of the business requirements of our various units.

The result is a People Strategy that emphasizes even more clearly
and explicitly the five values of the E.ON vision and that provides
the right support for our employees as they implement E.ON's
radical focus on the new energy world. The focus areas for this
support are Preparing our People for the Future, Providing Oppor-
tunities, and Recognizing Performance.

These focus areas are therefore unchanged and will continue
to guide all our HR activities for the next three to five years. This
demonstrates that our existing People Strategy provides an
excellent foundation for meeting the challenges resulting from
the spinoff.

The spinoff has brought with it some new work patterns as
E.ON pursues ambitious goals while operating in demanding
market environments. The focus areas of our People Strategy
will enable us to continue to put the needs of our employees
and executives at the center of what we do.


--- Page 34 ---

One2two and the Involvement of Employee Representation
The main focus of our HR work in 2016 was on preparing to
take the final employee-related steps for the Uniper spinoff. The
close, constructive working relationship between management
and employee representatives was again an important success
factor for the implementation of the One2two project, just as it
had been in the previous year. It continued in the spirit the Joint
Declaration and Framework Agreement of the Management
Board of E.ON SE, the Executive Committee of the SE Works
Council of E.ON SE and the Executive Committee of the Group
Works Council of E.ON SE, which was agreed on in 2014. In
particular, the Joint Declaration sets the main social framework
for any One2two measures and for the involvement of employee
representatives in One2two.

A Project Council consisting of leading employee representatives
was created in 2015. In 2016 it was continuously informed in
advance of decisions pending in the Project Steering Committee.
It had the opportunity to discuss the decisions with the E.ON
Management Board and to make alternative recommendations.
Employee representatives were at all times actively involved in
One2two decision-making processes and implementation projects
at an early stage.

The Uniper spinoff led to the decision to separate the support
functions as well (IT, HR, and Financial Services). Employees
were assigned on the basis of the One2two rules and guidelines
which had been negotiated with the works councils and specified
in the Partnership Agreement between E.ON, Uniper, and E.ON
Business Services.

Phoenix and the Involvement of Employee Representatives

In the fourth quarter of 2016 E.ON launched a restructuring
program called Phoenix. It will be conducted in keeping with
our well-established tradition of working closely with employee
representatives and involving them early. A Joint Declaration
and Framework Agreement of the Management Board of E.ON SE,
the Executive Committee of the SE Works Council of E.ON SE
and the Group Works Council of E.ON SE was concluded in
November and thus at an early stage of Phoenix. This document
will serve as the foundation for management and employee

representatives to work together openly and constructively
throughout Phoenix. A Project Council consisting of leading
employee representatives was created, as it had been with
One2two. It met for the first time in December, marking the
beginning of employee representatives’ continual involvement
in Phoenix.

Collaborative Partnership with Employee Representatives
E.ON places a strong emphasis on working with employee
representatives as partners. This collaborative partnership is
integral to our corporate culture. At a European level, E.ON
management works closely with the SE Works Council of E.ON
SE, whose members come from all European countries in which
E.ON operates. Under the SE Agreement, the SE Works Council
of E.ON SE is informed and consulted about issues that transcend
national borders.

Alongside the forms of codetermination required by law in
European countries outside Germany, the involvement of
employee representatives in these countries is fostered by
the SE Agreement, by collaboration at the Group level, and
by the Agreement on Minimum Standards for Restructuring
Measures, which was concluded between management and
the European Works Council (the forerunner of the SE Works
Council of E.ON SE) in 2010.

Prior to E.ON's adoption of a functionally oriented management
model, in 2014 management and the Group Works Council in
Germany concluded the Agreement on Future Social Partnership
in the Context of the Functionally Oriented Management Model.
The agreement, which stipulates the principles of the future
social partnership at E.ON's operations in Germany, manifests
a shared responsibility for the company and its employees and
represents a special milestone in the history of codetermination
at E.ON.

Business Report

Talent Management

The purpose of our talent management is to hire highly qualified
people and to foster our employees’ ongoing personal and pro-
fessional development.

In 2016 E.ON's status as a top employer was again confirmed
by prestigious rankings.

This recognition was one of the reasons we were able to attract
outstanding talent, including recent university graduates. The
E.ON Graduate Program remained one of the most coveted ways
of joining our company. Participants are assigned a mentor,
receive special training, and gain experience during placements
at their home E.ON unit as well as at other units in the same
country and elsewhere. Sixty-four graduates entered the program
in 2016. Their backgrounds and interests reflect the emphasis
E.ON places on diversity:

¢ They will work in a wide range of job families (including engi-
neering, IT, sales, finance, corporate development, and HR).

¢ They come from around the world (including the United
Kingdom, Germany, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Vietnam, Nigeria,
China, India, Hungary, Romania, Spain, and Sweden).

¢ At 33 percent, the proportion of women participants
remains high.

The foundation of our strategic, needs-oriented talent manage-
ment is the Management Review Process, which we conducted
again in 2016. It helps ensure the continued professional devel-
opment of managers and executives, our various units and job
families, and the entire organization. It also creates transparency
about our current talent situation and our needs for the future.

52

In 2016 we conducted more events for talented employees. The
main purpose of these events is for the participants to get to
know each other, to network, and to share information across
organizational boundaries. In addition, participants discuss
thoroughly issues that are important to our business.

In 2016 we also completely revised our talent landscape. The
new landscape, which will be introduced in 2017, will enable
us to continue to meet our business units’ changing needs and
requirements. A key criterion during the design phase was to
increase the ways in which we identify and develop talent at the
various levels of our company. In addition, the new talent land-
scape encompasses not only the typical executive career path
but also those of project managers and experts. It offers greater
variation in each career path, promotes flexibility, and tailors an
individual development program for each talented employee. In
short, it puts our people at the center and facilitates career plan-
ning that meets the highest standards of today’s business world.

Professional Development

We launched our HR Online Learning App, a new learning
management system, in 2016. It better integrates our formal
learning and training offerings into our peoples’ workday. Addi-
tional user-friendly improvements to the new learning platform
are on the way. They will enable our people access learning
offerings on their mobile devices and will supplement our formal
offerings with informal learning opportunities, such as the use

of additional learning resources alongside our course offerings.
In 2016 we also began the Group-wide rollout of 2020 Leader-
ship, a new program whose purpose is to systematically prepare
our leaders for the new leadership requirements in the digital age.

Our catalog of formal training courses was supplemented by
other projects and initiatives specifically tailored to our company,
such as the Change Cube and Learning Take-Away Days.


--- Page 36 ---

Our central Learning Management System recorded 109,036
enrollments in our formal courses (which do not include our
online learning programs) in 2016. This equals 72,805 days of
classroom training, which accounts for 70 percent of our total
training offerings. On average, each employee received 1.7 days
of training in 2016. We do not record the duration of use of our
online learning programs.

Diversity

Diversity will remain a key element of E.ON's competitiveness.
Diversity and an appreciative corporate culture promote creativ-
ity and innovation. This is a central aspect of the E.ON vision

as well. E.ON brings together a diverse team of people who differ
by nationality, age, gender, disability, religion, and/or cultural
and social background. Diversity is a key success factor. Numer-
ous studies have shown that heterogeneous teams outperform
homogenous ones. Diversity is equally crucial in view of demo-
graphic trends. Going forward, only those companies that
embrace diversity will be able to remain attractive employers
and be less affected by the shortage of skilled workers. In addi-
tion, a diverse workforce enables us to do an even better job

of meeting our customers’ needs and requirements. More than
a decade ago, in 2006, we issued a Group Policy on Equal
Opportunity and Diversity, which we updated in 2016 in coop-
eration with the European Works Council. In June 2008 we
publicly affirmed our long-standing commitment to fairness and
respect by signing the German Diversity Charter, which now
has about 2,400 signatories. E.ON therefore belongs to a large
network of companies committed to diversity, tolerance, fairness,
and respect.

Our approach to promoting diversity is holistic, encompassing
all dimensions of diversity. It ensures equal opportunity for all
employees and fosters and harnesses diversity in an individual
way.

In 2016 we again implemented numerous measures to promote
diversity at E.ON. An important purpose of these measures is

to foster the career development of female managers. Each unit
has specific targets, and progress towards these targets is
monitored at regular intervals. We have Group-wide recruiting
and hiring guidelines for management positions. These guide-
lines require that least one male and one female must be on the
short list for a vacant management position. As a result, in
2016 we again increased the proportion of women in leadership
positions. This proportion rose from just over 11 percent in 2010
to 19.6 percent at year-end 2016 for the Group as a whole

and from 9 percent to 15.7 percent for Germany. Our units have
had support mechanisms for female managers in place for a
number of years. These mechanisms include mentoring programs
for female next-generation managers, coaching, unconscious-bias
training, the provision of daycare, and flexible work schedules.
Significantly increasing the percentage of women in our internal
talent pool is a further prerequisite for raising, over the long term,
their percentage in management and top executive positions.

We conducted activities and initiatives throughout 2016 to
enable all of our employees to experience difference and diversity
and to raise their awareness of the contribution made by each
individual. For example, we hosted an exhibition on disability and
commemorated International Women’s Day across our company.

Many of these measures are already having an impact. Our prog-
ress is receiving recognition outside our company as well. For
example, E.ON received the Total E-Quality Seal for exemplary
HR policies based on equal opportunity and diversity for the
third year in a row.

Workforce Figures

At year-end 2016 the E.ON Group had 43,138 employees world-
wide, roughly the same number as at year-end 2015. E.ON
also had 971 apprentices in Germany and 124 board members
and managing directors worldwide. These numbers have been

The hiring of apprentices in Germany as full-time employees and,
in particular, the transfer of service employees in Romania from
Customer Solutions were the main reasons for the increase in
Energy Networks’ headcount. This was partially offset by
restructuring in Romania.

The transfer of service employees in Romania to Energy Networks
along with restructuring were the main reasons for the decline
in Customer Solutions’ headcount.

The filling of vacancies and business expansion in the United
States led to an increase in the number of employees at Renew-
ables.

Transfers to Uniper as part of the spinoff project led to a signifi-
cant decline in headcount at Corporate Functions/Other. This
does not include divested operations.

Non-Core Business currently consists of our nuclear energy busi-
ness in Germany. The separation of this business in conjunction

with the Uniper spinoff led to a need to add staff in some depart-
ments, resulting in a slight increase in the number of employees.

The decline in headcount at Other resulted from the sale of
exploration and production operations.

in the prior year (3.5 percent). The increase was due to voluntary
terminations as part of restructuring programs in Romania
along with an increase in voluntary terminations in the United
Kingdom.

Occupational Health and Safety

Occupational health and safety have the highest priority at
E.ON. A key performance indicator ("KPI") for our safety is total
recordable injury frequency ("TRIF")—which measures the
number of reported fatalities, lost-time injuries, restricted-work
injuries, and medical-treatment injuries that occur on the job—
per million hours of work. Our TRIF figures also include E.ON
companies that are not fully consolidated but over which
E.ON has operational control. E.ON employees’ TRIF in 2016
was 2.5, the same low level as in the prior year. The change is
partly a result of a further improvement in our reporting culture.

Regrettably, three employees died on the job in 2016, and another
suffered fatal injuries in a traffic accident. The accidents occurred
in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Czech Republic.

To continually improve their safety performance, our units have
in place certified health, safety, and environment ("HSE")
management systems that meet international standards. To
ensure improvement is continuous, our units develop HSE
improvement plans based on a management review of their
performance in the prior year. In addition, in 2016 the top
executives of all units were required to participate in a specially
designed HSE leadership training module.

The healthcare systems of the countries we operate in differ
considerably in terms of their delivery of medical care, their
health-insurance and pension systems, and their legal require-
ments for occupational health and safety. Nevertheless, the
most common illnesses that make employees unable to work are
the same in all countries: musculoskeletal disorders, psycho-
logical problems, and respiratory infections. The leading causes
of death are the same as well: heart disease and cancer. E.ON's
health policies focus on preventing these diseases. We strive
to prevent psychological problems by providing mental-health
training and by conducting a program that gives employees
access to outside counselors. Check-ups and preventive care
by our company doctors help reduce general and workplace-
specific risks. We also conduct campaigns to raise awareness
of bowel cancer and the importance of detecting cancer early.
Flu vaccination programs help prevent dangerous respiratory
illnesses. Together, these programs address the increasingly
important issue of maintaining our employees’ capacity to work.

Compensation, Pension Plans, Employee Participation
Attractive compensation and appealing fringe benefits are
essential to a competitive work environment. The compensation
plans of nearly all our employees contain an element that reflects
the company's performance. This element is typically based

on the same key figures that are also used in the Management
Board's compensation plan.

Company contributions to employee pension plans represent an
important component of an employee's compensation package
and have long had a prominent place in the E.ON Group. They
are an important foundation of employees’ future financial secu-
rity and also foster employee retention. EON companies supple-
ment their company pension plans with attractive programs to
help their employees save for the future.

Apprenticeships

E.ON continues to place great emphasis on vocational training
for young people. The E.ON Group had 971 apprentices and
work-study students in Germany at year-end 2016. This repre-
sented 5.3 percent of E.ON's total workforce in Germany, com-
pared with 5.5 percent at the end of the prior year. The number
of apprentices as well as their proportion of our total workforce
declined relative to the prior year. This is mainly attributable to
a reduction in the number of apprentices taken on at our nuclear
power stations.

Established in 2003 as part of a pact between industry and
the German federal government, the E.ON training initiative to
combat youth unemployment was extended for three more
years and will now continue through 2020. In 2015 it helped
more than 460 young people in Germany get a start on their
careers through internships that prepare them for an apprentice-
ship as well as school projects and other programs. The number
of participants declined from 550 in 2015 owing to a tighter
budget and a redesign of the initiative.

Macroeconomic Situation

The OECD forecasts a gradual acceleration of global economic
growth in 2017 and 2018. It expects the global economy to
grow by 3.3 percent in 2017 and by 3.6 percent in 2018. The
corresponding figures for the United States are 2.3 percent and
3 percent, where weaker growth (1.6 percent and 1.7 percent)
is forecast for the euro zone. The OECD sees substantial political
uncertainty and financial risks. It believes that fiscal initiatives
and structural reforms should lead to stronger growth.

Employees
The number of employees in the E.ON Group (excluding appren-

tices and board members/managing directors) will decline
going forward.

Anticipated Earnings Situation

Forecast Earnings Performance

Our forecast for full-year 2017 earnings continues to be signifi-
cantly influenced by the difficult business environment in the
energy industry. Examples include the British pound's weakness
following the Brexit vote, interventionist remedies proposed by
Britain's Competition and Markets Authority, and the foreseeable
reduction of network returns in Germany. In addition, the current
low-interest-rate environment and increasingly fierce competi-
tion are putting downward pressure on achievable returns.

For our 2017 earnings forecast, we adjusted our internal financial
key figures with respect to the treatment of nuclear asset-
retirement obligations. Effects resulting from the valuation of
these provisions at the balance-sheet date are now reported
under non-operating earnings; however, this does not apply to
the accruals on these provisions. This change, which improves
the depiction of E.ON's underlying earnings strength, takes effect
on January 1, 2017. In view of the fundamental change in our
business and its structure in 2016, it did not make sense to adjust
the prior-year figures.

We expect the E.ON Group's 2017 adjusted EBIT to be between
€2.8 and €3.1 billion and its 2017 adjusted net income to be
between €1.20 and €1.45 billion. In addition, we expect the E.ON
Group to achieve a cash-conversion rate of at least 80 percent
and ROCE of 8 to 10 percent.

Corporate Functions/Other __ significantly below prior year -0.4
Non-Core Business at prior-year level 06
E.ON Group 2.8-3.1 3.1

1Adjusted for extraordinary effects.

We expect Energy Networks' 2017 adjusted EBIT to be signifi-
cantly above the prior-year figure. The principal positive factors
in Germany are special regulatory effects relating to the delayed
repayment of personnel costs from 2015 along with non-recur-
ring items stemming from the conversion to the amended
incentive-regulation scheme. German lawmakers are currently
debating the Grid Fee Modernization Act, which, if enacted,
could lead to an earnings improvement in 2017, which, however,
would be offset again in the year 2019 to 2021. In addition,
improved power tariffs in Sweden and in the Czech Republic will
increase earnings. In Hungary we will benefit from the new
regulation period in 2017.

We anticipate that Customer Solutions’ adjusted EBIT will be
significantly below the prior-year level. Earnings in Germany
will be lower due primarily to competition-related factors. In
addition, startup costs in the customer-solutions business will
have an adverse impact on earnings and will not generate posi-
tive earnings streams until subsequent years. The intervention
of the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority and rising costs
for customer acquisition as part of our new marketing strategy
will impact our earnings in the United Kingdom. Earnings there
will also be adversely affected by the planned Brexit and the
development of the British pound. Earnings will be lower in
Romania primarily because of narrowing margins due to keener
competition in the wake of market liberalization.

We expect Renewables’ adjusted EBIT to be at the prior-year
level. Significant new-build projects (such as Radford Run,
Bruenning Breeze, Arkona, and Rampion wind farms) will not
enter service and contribute to earnings until the end of 2017
or in subsequent years.

We anticipate that adjusted EBIT at Corporate Functions/Other
will be significantly below the prior-year level, primarily because
of the non-recurrence of positive derivative earnings reported
in 2016 and the dividend on our stake in Nord Stream, because
we intend to place this stake in a contractual trust arrangement
in 2017.

At Non-Core Business we expect PreussenElektra's adjusted
EBIT to be at the prior-year level.

Anticipated Financial Situation

Planned Funding Measures

In addition to our investments planned for 2017 and the dividend
for 2016, in 2017 we will likely make payments in conjunction
with the law Germany's two houses of parliament passed

in December 2016 to reassign responsibility for the country's
nuclear waste. These payments will be funded primarily with
available liquid funds, the sale of securities as well as the issuance
of commercial paper and bonds.

Dividend

In line with our consistent dividend policy, our goal is to pay
out to E.ON shareholders 50 to 60 percent of our adjusted net
income. E.ON plans to propose the payment of a fixed dividend
of €0.30 per share for the 2017 financial year.

Planned Investments

Our medium-term plan calls for investments of €3.6 billion in
2017. Our capital allocation will of course continue to be selec-
tive and disciplined. At the present time, the market is not
sufficiently pricing in risks, which adversely affects the long-
term profitability of investments. In light of these factors, we
will manage our current investment budget flexibly.

Energy Networks’ investments will consist in particular of
numerous individual investments to expand our intermediate-
and low-voltage networks, switching equipment, and metering
and control technology as well as other investments to ensure
the reliable and uninterrupted transmission and distribution of
electricity. Our investments provide important support to the
energy transition, particularly in Germany, and therefore make
a substantial contribution to supply security.

Investments at Customer Solutions will go toward metering,
upgrade, and efficiency projects as well as to heat and biomass
projects in Sweden and the United Kingdom.

The main focus of Renewables’ investments will be on offshore
wind farms in Europe (such as Rampion and Arkona) and
onshore farms in the United States (such as Radford Run and
Bruenning Breeze).

General Statement on E.ON's Future
Development

Over the last two years we have laid the foundation for E.ON
to have a successful future. But our transformation has only just
begun, and 2017 will be another year of change for E.ON. We
defined five goals for this year against which we all will measure
our progress in the remainder of the year:

We will strengthen our balance sheet and make the company
financially sustainable. This is the key prerequisite for us to grow
in the future. Although our markets offer many opportunities,
our financial resources are limited. Over the medium and long
term, we want to establish a sustainable financial foundation
from which to invest in E.ON's future.

We are putting our customers first. Our new brand idea—“Let's
create a better tomorrow"—makes a clear commitment. In
everything we do we need to ask how it benefits our customers,
what they want, and what will make their lives better.

The latest generation of energy products is digitally integrated.
We intend to be a pacesetter in the digitalization of the energy
business. Increasingly, digitalization will be a defining feature of

the solutions we offer our customers. We already have a success-
ful smartphone app that enables customers to manage their
energy consumption and all their communications with us. Other
exciting products are on the way this year.

We are convinced that the new E.ON is active in the right
markets. The energy future is green, distributed, and digital. But
this market is more fragmented than the conventional energy
world, and we face different competitors. We therefore need to
make E.ON more entrepreneurial and ensure that our offerings
get to market faster. To help us achieve this, we intend reduce
our bureaucracy this year, to make our organizational setup more
customer-centric, and to become leaner, more decentralized,
and more agile.

Leadership and cultural adaptation are now among our most
important tasks. E.ON has a very knowledgeable and dedicated
team of employees who work hard each day to transform our
company. We want to inspire them, because we will only be
successful on the road ahead by working together.

This Combined Group Management Report contains certain forward-looking statements based on EON management's current assumptions and forecasts and other currently available information.
Various known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors could lead to material differences between E.ON's actual future results, financial situation, development, or performance and the
estimates given here. EON assumes no liability whatsoever to update these forward-looking statements or to conform them to future events or developments.

view of the risks and chances resulting from their planned busi-
ness activities. It provides:

* meaningful information about risks and chances to the busi-
ness and to the financial community enabling the business
to derive individual risks/chances as well as aggregate risk
profiles within the time horizon of the medium-term plan
(three years)

* transparency on risk exposures in compliance with legal
regulations including KonTraG, BilMoG, and BilReG.

defines standardized processes and tools covering the identifi-
cation, evaluation, countermeasures, monitoring, and reporting
of risks and chances. Overall governance is provided by Group
Risk Management on behalf of the E.ON SE Risk Committee.

Allrisks and chances have an accountable member of the Man-
agement Board, have a designated risk owner who remains
operationally responsible for managing that risk/chance, and
are identified in a dedicated bottom-up process.



--- Page 46 ---

Scope

Our risk management system in the broader sense has a total of
four components:

* an internal monitoring system

* amanagement information system

* preventive measures

* arisk management system in the narrow sense.

The purpose of the internal monitoring system is to ensure
the proper functioning of business processes. It consists of
organizational preventive measures (such as policies and work
instructions) and internal controls and audits (particularly by
Internal Audit).

The E.ON internal management information systems identifies
risks early so that steps can be taken to actively address them.
Reporting by Controlling, Finance, and Accounting departments
as well as Internal Audit reports are of particular importance in
early risk detection.

ks

General Measures to Limit
We take the following general preventive measures to limit risks.

Managing Legal and Regulatory Risks

We engage in intensive and constructive dialog with govern-
ment agencies and policymakers in order to manage the risks
resulting from the E.ON Group's policy, legal, and regulatory
environment. Furthermore, we strive to conduct proper project
management so as to identify early and minimize the risks
attending our new-build projects.

We attempt to minimize the operational risks of legal proceedings
and ongoing planning processes by managing them appropriately
and by designing appropriate contracts beforehand.

Manging Operations and IT Risks

To limit operational and IT risks, we will continue to improve our
network management and the optimal dispatch of our generation
assets. At the same time, we are implementing operational and
infrastructure improvements that will enhance the reliability

of our generation assets and distribution networks, even under

extraordinarily adverse conditions. In addition, we have factored
the operational and financial effects of environmental risks into
our emergency plan. They are part of a catalog of crisis and
system-failure scenarios prepared for the Group by our incident
and crisis management team.

Our IT systems are maintained and optimized by qualified EON
Group experts, outside experts, and a wide range of technological
security measures. In addition, the E.ON Group has in place a
range of technological and organizational measures to counter
the risk of unauthorized access to data, the misuse of data, and
data loss.

Managing Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental
(“HSSE"), Human Resources ("HR"), and Other Risks
Furthermore, the following are among the comprehensive
measures we take to address HSSE, HR, and other risks (also in
conjunction with operational and IT risks):

* systematic employee training, advanced training, and quali-
fication programs

¢ further refinement of our production procedures, processes,
and technologies

¢ regular facility and network maintenance and inspection

* company guidelines as well as work and process instructions

¢ quality management, control, and assurance

¢ project, environmental, and deterioration management

¢ crisis-prevention measures and emergency planning.

Should an accident occur despite the measures we take, we
have a reasonable level of insurance coverage.

Managing Market Risks
We use a comprehensive sales management system and inten-
sive customer management to manage margin risks.

In order to limit our exposure to commodity price risks, we con-
duct systematic risk management. The key elements of our risk
management are, in addition to binding Group-wide policies

and a Group-wide reporting system, the use of quantitative key
figures, the limitation of risks, and the strict separation of func-
tions between departments. Furthermore, we utilize derivative


--- Page 47 ---

Risk and Chances Report

financial instruments that are commonly used in the marketplace.
These instruments are transacted with financial institutions,
brokers, power exchanges, and third parties whose creditworthi-
ness we monitor on an ongoing basis. Our local sales units and
the remaining generation assets have set up local risk manage-
ment under central governance standards to monitor these
underlying commodity exposures and reduce them to acceptable
levels through forward hedging.

Managing Strategic Risks

We have comprehensive preventive measures in place to manage
potential risks relating to acquisitions and investments. To the
degree possible, these measures include, in addition to the rele-
vant company guidelines and manuals, comprehensive due dili-
gence, legally binding contracts, a multi-stage approvals process,
and shareholding and project controlling. Comprehensive post-
acquisition projects also contribute to successful integration.

Managing Finance and Treasury Risks

This category encompasses credit, currency, tax, and asset-
management risks and chances. We use systematic risk manage-
ment to monitor and control our interest-rate and currency
risks and manage these risks using derivative and non-derivative
financial instruments. Here, E.ON SE plays a central role by
aggregating risk positions through intragroup transactions and
hedging these risks in the market. Due to E.ON SE's intermediary
role, its risk position is largely closed.

We use a Group-wide credit risk management system to system-
atically measure and monitor the creditworthiness of our busi-
ness partners on the basis of Group-wide minimum standards.
We manage our credit risk by taking appropriate measures,
which include obtaining collateral and setting limits. The EON
Group's Risk Committee is regularly informed about all credit
risks. A further component of our risk management is a conser-
vative investment strategy and a broadly diversified portfolio.

Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains
detailed information about the use of derivative financial instru-
ments and hedging transactions. Note 31 describes the general
principles of our risk management and applicable risk metrics
for quantifying risks relating to commodities, credit, liquidity,
interest rates, and currency translation.

64

Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM")

Our risk management system, which is the basis for the risks
and chances described in the next section, encompasses:

+ systematic risk and chance identification

+ risk and chance analysis and evaluation

* management and monitoring of risks and chances by
analyzing and evaluating countermeasures and preventive
systems

+ documentation and reporting.

As required by law, our ERM's effectiveness is reviewed regularly
by Internal Audit. In compliance with the provisions of Section
91, Paragraph 2, of the German Stock Corporation Act relating
to the establishment of a risk-monitoring and early warning
system, E.ON has a Risk Committee for the E.ON Group and
for each of its segments. The Risk Committee's mission is to
achieve a comprehensive view of our risk exposure at the Group
and unit level and to actively manage risk exposure in line with
our risk strategy.

Our ERM applies to all fully consolidated E.ON Group companies
and all companies valued at equity whose book value in E.ON's
Consolidated Financial Statements is greater than €50 million.
We take an inventory of our risks and chances at each quarterly
balance-sheet date.

As part of the continuous development of our risk management
system, at the start of 2016 we initiated a project within the
broader Finance Excellence program to ensure that our risk
management reflects the Uniper spinoff and E.ON's changed risk
profile. In this project we developed E.ON's enterprise risk man-
agement from a compliance-oriented model to a significantly
more value-oriented Group-wide model. This model was success-
fully implemented in the course of 2016. The changes encom-
pass a more stringent identification process for risks and chances
(including unit-specific thresholds), a more realistic evaluation
of risks and chances, and integrated and focused reporting of
the individual risk profiles of each segment to ensure the risk
information is considered in line with the planning and forecast-
ing process. Furthermore, the risk categories were adjusted to
support E.ON's changed business profile.

Health, safety, and environmental risks and chances

Market risks

Risks and chances from the development of commodity prices and margins and from changes

Strategic risks

Finance and treasury risks

E.ON uses a multistep process to identify, evaluate, simulate,
and classify risks and chances. Risks and chances are generally
reported on the basis of objective evaluations. If this is not
possible, we use internal estimates by experts. The evaluation
measures a risk/chance's financial impact on our current earnings
plan while factoring in risk-reducing countermeasures. The
evaluation therefore reflects the net risk.

We then evaluate the likelihood of occurrence of quantifiable
risks and chances. For example, the wind may blow more or less
hard at a wind farm. This type of risk is modeled with a normal
distribution. Modeling is supported by a Group-wide IT-based
system. Extremely unlikely events—those whose likelihood of
occurrence is 5 percent or less—are classified as tail events. Tail
events are not included in the simulation described below.

This statistical distribution makes it possible for our IT-based
risk management system to conduct a Monte Carlo simulation
of quantifiable risks/chances. This yields an aggregated risk
distribution that is quantified as the deviation from our current
earnings plan for adjusted EBIT.

Credit, foreign-currency, tax, and asset-management risks and chances

We use the 5 and 95 percent percentiles of this aggregated risk
distribution as the best case and worst case, respectively.
Statistically, this means that with this risk distribution there is a
90-percent likelihood that the deviation from our current earn-
ings plan for adjusted EBIT will remain within these extremes.

The last step is to assign, in accordance with the 5 and 95 per-
cent percentiles, the aggregated risk distribution to impact
classes—low, moderate, medium, major, and high—according to
their quantitative impact on adjusted EBIT. The impact classes
are shown in the table below:

Impact Classes

low x < €10 million
moderate €10 million < x < €50 million
medium €50 million < x < €200 million
major €200 million < x < €1 billion
high x 2 €1 billion

Risk and Chances Report

General Risk Situation

The table below shows the average annual aggregated risk
position (aggregated risk position) across the time horizon of
the medium-term plan for all quantifiable risks and chances
(excluding tail events) for each risk category based on our most
important key figure, adjusted EBIT.

66

Risk Category

Risk Category Worst Case (5 percent percentil) Best Case (95 percent percentil)
Legal and regulatory risks Major Moderate

Operational and IT risks Major Low

HSSE, HR, and Other Low Low

Market risks Major Medium

Strategic risks Medium Low

Finance and treasury risks Medium Medium

The E.ON Group has a major risk positions in the following cate-
gories: legal and regulatory risks, operational and IT risks, and
market risks. As a result, the aggregate risk position of E.ON SE
as the Group is major. In other words, the E.ON Group's average
annual adjusted EBIT risk ought not to exceed -€200 million to
-€1 billion in 95 percent of all cases.

Risks and Chances by Category

E.ON's major risks and chances by risk category are described
below. Also described are major risks and chances stemming
from tail events as well as major qualitative risks that would
impact adjusted EBIT by more than €200 million. Risks and
chances that would affect net income and/or cash flow by more
than €200 million are included as well.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

The political, legal, and regulatory environment in which the
E.ON Group does business is also a source of external risks, such
as decisions by governments to phase out power generation
using certain fuels. In view of the economic and financial crisis
in many EU member states, policy and regulatory intervention—
such as additional taxes, additional reporting requirements (for
example, EMIR, REMIT, MiFiD2), price moratoriums, regulatory
price reductions, and changes to support schemes for renew-
ables—is becoming increasingly apparent. Such intervention
could pose a risk to E.ON's operations in these countries. In par-
ticular, the refinancing situation of many European countries

could have a direct impact on the E.ON Group's cost of capital.
Besides governmental risks and chances this also includes the
risk of litigation, fines, and claims, governance- and compliance-
related issues as well as risks and chances related to contracts
and permits. Changes to this environment can lead to consider-
able uncertainty with regard to planning and, under certain cir-
cumstances, to impairment charges but also can create chances.
This results in a major risk position and a chance position.

PreussenElektra

PreussenElektra's business is substantially influenced by regu-
lation. In general, regulation can result in risks for its remaining
business activities. One example is the Fukushima nuclear acci-
dent. Policy measures taken in response to such events could
have a direct impact on further operation of a nuclear power
plant ("NPP") or trigger liabilities stemming from solidarity obli-
gation agreed on among German NPP operators. Furthermore,
new regulatory requirements, such as additional mandatory
safety measures, could lead to production outages and higher
costs. Regulation can also require an increase in provisions for
dismantling and storage. This could pose major risks for E.ON.


--- Page 50 ---

In 2003 Section 6 of Germany's Atomic Energy Act granted
consent for Unterweser NPP to store radioactive spent nuclear
fuel in an on-site intermediate storage facility. Lawsuits were
filed against the consent. The complainants asked that the court
rescind the consent on the grounds that the storage facility is
not sufficiently protected against terrorist attacks. A ruling is
expected in 2017. If the court rules in favor of the complainants,
nuclear fuel could not be removed from Unterweser NPP on
schedule. This would significantly prolong dismantling, thereby
leading to higher costs. This could pose a major risk.

On December 6, 2016, Germany's Federal Constitutional Court in
Karlsruhe ruled that the thirteenth amended version of Germany's
Atomic Energy Act (“the Act”) is fundamentally constitutional.
The Act's only unconstitutional elements are that certain NPP
operators will be unable to produce their electricity allotment
from 2002 and that it contains no mechanism for compensating
operators for investments to extend NPP operating lifetimes.
Lawmakers have until June 30, 2018, to pass legislation that
redresses these elements. E.ON filed a suit against Lower Saxony,
Bavaria, and the Federal Republic of Germany to seek approxi-
mately €380 million in damages for the nuclear-energy morato-
rium ordered in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear accident.
PreussenElektra's appeal is pending before the State Superior
Court in Celle. These matters could pose major risks and yield
major chances.

Customer Solutions

The E.ON Group's operations subject it to certain risks relating
to legal proceedings, ongoing planning processes, and regulatory
changes. These risks relate in particular to legal actions and
proceedings concerning contract and price adjustments to reflect
market dislocations or (including as a consequence of the trans-
formation of Germany's energy system) an altered business
climate in the power and gas business, price increases, alleged
market-sharing agreements, and anticompetitive practices.
This could pose major risks.

Energy Networks

The operation of energy networks in Germany is subject to a
large degree of regulation. New laws and regulation periods
cause uncertainty in this business. In addition, matters related
to the Renewable Energy Law, such as issues regarding solar
energy, can cause temporary fluctuations in our cash flow and
adjusted EBIT. This could create chances and pose major risks.

In January 2017 the German Federal Ministry for Economic
Affairs and Energy published a revised draft of the Grid Fee

grid operators in Germany, it would have a positive effect on
earnings 2017. This amount would be passed through to grid
customers as credits in 2019 to 2021, which would result in

a corresponding reduction in earnings. This could result in major
risks as well as chances.

In Germany, the fourth regulation period for gas and power
begins in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The regulatory agency
will set the revenue caps based on a cost review and efficiency
benchmarking. If this process results in revenue caps that are
lower than anticipated, it would have an adverse impact on our
anticipated earnings and lead to major risks.

The awarding of network concessions for power and gas is
extremely competitive in Germany. This creates a risk of losing
concessions, particularly in urban areas with good infrastruc-
tures. If a concession is lost, the network is sold to the new
concessionaire at a negotiated price. Lawmakers intend to make
changes in 2017 in the modalities of how a network is relin-
quished after a network concession has been lost. This will likely
result in a legally mandated stipulation of the purchase price.
This could make competition even keener.

Operational and IT Risks

The operational and strategic management of the E.ON Group
relies heavily on complex information technology. This includes
risks and chances arising from information security.

Technologically complex production facilities are used in the
production and distribution of energy, resulting in risks from
procurement and logistics, construction, operations and main-
tenance of assets as well as general project risks. In case of
PreussenElektra, this also includes dismantling activities. One
specific example here is the risk of contamination of individual
facility parts. Our operations in and outside Germany could
experience unanticipated operational or other problems leading
to a power failure or shutdown and/or higher costs and addi-
tional investments. Operational failures or extended production
stoppages of facilities or components of facilities as well as
environmental damage could negatively impact our earnings,
affect our cost situation, and/or result in the imposition of fines.
In unlikely cases, this could lead to a high risk. Overall, it results
in a major risk position and a chance position.


--- Page 51 ---

Risk and Chances Report

General project risks can include a delay in projects and with that
increased capital requirements. For our Renewables segment,
a project delay could lead to the loss of government subsidies
and cause potential partners to exit the project, which could, in
unlikely cases, likewise lead to a high risk.

We could also be subject to environmental liabilities associated
with our power generation operations that could materially
and adversely affect our business. In addition, new or amended
environmental laws and regulations may result in increases in
our costs.

HSSE, HR, and Other Risks

Health and safety are important aspects of our day-to-day busi-
ness. Our operating activities can therefore pose risks in these
areas and create social and environmental risks and chances. In
addition, our operating business potentially faces risks resulting
from human error and employee turnover. It is important that
we act responsibly along our entire value chain and that we
communicate consistently, enhance the dialog, and maintain
good relationships with our key stakeholders. We actively con-
sider environmental, social, and corporate-governance issues.
These efforts support our business decisions and our public
relations. Our objective is to minimize our reputation risks and
garner public support so that we can continue to operate our
business successfully. These matters do not result in a major
risk or chance position.

In the past, predecessor entities of E.ON SE conducted mining
operations, resulting in obligations in North Rhine-Westphalia
and Bavaria. E.ON SE can be held responsible for damage. This
could lead to major individual risks that we currently only evalu-
ate qualitatively.

Market Risks

Our units operate in an international market environment that
is characterized by general risks relating to the business cycle.
In addition, the entry of new suppliers into the marketplace along
with more aggressive tactics by existing market participants
and reputational risks have created a keener competitive environ-
ment for our electricity business in and outside Germany which
could reduce our margins. Market developments could however
also have a positive impact on our business. Such factors include

68

wholesale and retail price developments, higher customer
churn rates, and temporary volume effects in the network busi-
ness. This results in a major risk position and a chance position.

The demand for electric power and natural gas is seasonal, with
our operations generally experiencing higher demand during
the cold-weather months of October through March and lower
demand during the warm-weather months of April through
September. As a result of these seasonal patterns, our sales and
results of operations are higher in the first and fourth quarters
and lower in the second and third quarters. Sales and results of
operations for all of our energy operations can be negatively
affected by periods of unseasonably warm weather during the
autumn and winter months. We expect seasonal and weather-
related fluctuations in sales and results of operations to continue.
Periods of exceptionally cold weather—very low average tem-
peratures or extreme daily lows—in the fall and winter months
can create chances due to higher demand for electricity and
natural gas.

The E.ON portfolio of physical assets, long-term contracts, and
end-customer sales is exposed to major risks from fluctuations
in commodity prices. The principal commodity prices to which
E.ON is exposed relate to electricity, gas, and emission allow-
ances. In view of the Uniper spinoff, E.ON is establishing procure-
ment capabilities for its sales business and for its remaining
energy production in order to ensure market access and manage
the remaining commodity risks accordingly.

Strategic Risks

Our business strategy involves acquisitions and investments in
our core business as well as disposals. This strategy depends in
part on our ability to successfully identify, acquire, and integrate
companies that enhance, on acceptable terms, our energy busi-
ness. In order to obtain the necessary approvals for acquisitions,
we may be required to divest other parts of our business or to
make concessions or undertakings that affect our business. In
addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve
the returns we expect from any acquisition or investment. Fur-
thermore, investments and acquisitions in new geographic areas
or lines of business require us to become familiar with new
sales markets and competitors and to address the attending
business risks.


--- Page 52 ---

In the case of planned disposals, E.ON faces the risk of disposals
not taking place or being delayed and the risk that E.ON receives
lower-than-anticipated disposal proceeds. In such projects, it is
not possible to determine the likelihood of these risks. In addition,
after transactions close we could face liability risks resulting
from contractual obligations.

The risk and chance position in this category was not major at
the balance-sheet date.

Finance and Treasury Risks

E.ON is exposed to credit risk in its operating activities and
through the use of financial instruments. Credit risk results from
non-delivery or partial delivery by a counterparty of the agreed
consideration for services rendered, from total or partial failure
to make payments owing on existing accounts receivable, and
from replacement risks in open transactions. In addition, in
unlikely cases joint and several liability for jointly operated power
plants lead to a high risk.

E.ON's international business operations expose it to risks from
currency fluctuation. One form of this risk is transaction risk,
which occurs when payments are made in a currency other than
E.ON's functional currency. Another form of risk is translation
risk, which occurs when currency fluctuations lead to accounting
effects when assets/liabilities and income/expenses of E.ON
companies outside the euro zone are translated into euros and
entered into our Consolidated Financial Statements. Currency-
translation risk results mainly from our positions in U.S. dollars,
pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Czech krona, Romanian leus,
Hungarian forints, and Turkish lira. Positive developments in
foreign-currency rates can also create chances for our operating
business.

E.ON faces earnings risks from financial liabilities and interest
derivatives that are based on variable interest rates.

In addition, E.ON also faces major risks from price changes and
uncertainty on the current and non-current investments it makes
to cover its non-current obligations, particularly pension and
asset-retirement obligations. Furthermore, E.ON owns a minority
stake in Uniper. A high degree of uncertainty attends this
minority stake due to fluctuations in Uniper's stock price and
earnings effects from Uniper's net income.

Furthermore, uncertainties regarding investment partners and
projects could lead to higher-than-anticipated investment
expenditures.

Declining or rising discount rates could lead to increased or
reduced provisions for pensions and asset-retirement obligations,
including long-term liabilities. This can create a high degree of
uncertainty for E.ON.

In principle, E.ON could also encounter tax risks and chances
that unlikely cases could be high. Specifically, the new adminis-
tration in the United States could propose legislative changes
that could, in particular, significantly reduce corporate tax rates,
accelerate depreciation, and limit the tax deductions on imported
economic goods. Such changes could pose major risks for our
Renewables segment's future U.S. renewables projects resulting
from a significant reduction in tax-equity demand.

A favorable court ruling regarding Germany's nuclear-fuel tax
would create a high chance for a refund. Similarly, PreussenElektra
is involved in arbitration proceedings with contract partners
regarding long-term supply contracts and nuclear fuel elements.
These proceedings could present major chances as well as risks.

This category's risk and chance position is not major.

Management Boards's Evaluation of the Risk
Situation

The risk situation of the E.ON Group's operating business at
year-end 2016 had been changed for two main reasons. First, the
Uniper spinoff reduced our overall risk exposure and changed
our risk profile itself. The risks related to conventional generation,
exploration and production, and global commodity trading were
transferred to Uniper. Second, our Group-wide Enterprise Risk
project enabled us to make significant changes to our method-
ology to reflect E.ON's new business profile. Although the average
annual risk for the E.ON Group's adjusted EBIT is classified as
major, from today's perspective we do not perceive any risk
position that could threaten the existence of the E.ON Group or
individual segments.

Internal Control System for the Accounting Process

Disclosures Pursuant to Section 289, Para-
graph 5, and Section 315, Paragraph 2, Item 5,
of the German Commercial Code on the Inter-
nal Control System for the Accounting Process

General Principles

We apply Section 315a (1) of the German Commercial Code
and prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accor-
dance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS")
and the interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee
that were adopted by the European Commission for use in the
EU as of the end of the fiscal year and whose application was
mandatory as of the balance-sheet date (see Note 1 to the Con-
solidated Financial Statements). Energy Networks (Germany,
Sweden, and East-Central Europe/Turkey), Customer Solutions
(Germany, United Kingdom, Other), Renewables, Non-Core
Business, and Corporate Functions/Other are our IFRS reportable
segments.

E.ON SE prepares its Financial Statements in accordance with
the German Commercial Code, the SE Ordinance (in conjunction
with the German Stock Corporation Act), and the German
Energy Act.

We prepare a Combined Group Management Report which
applies to both the E.ON Group and E.ON SE.

Accounting Process

All companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
must comply with our uniform Accounting and Reporting
Guidelines for the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements
and the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. These
guidelines describe applicable IFRS accounting and valuation
principles. They also explain accounting principles typical in
the E.ON Group, such as those for provisions for nuclear-waste
management, the treatment of financial instruments, and the
treatment of regulatory obligations. We continually analyze
amendments to laws, new or amended accounting standards,
and other pronouncements for their relevance to and conse-
quences for our Consolidated Financial Statements and, if nec-
essary, update our guidelines and systems accordingly.

Group Management defines and oversees the roles and respon-
sibilities of various Group entities in the preparation of E.ON SE's
Financial Statements and the Consolidated Financial Statements.
These roles and responsibilities are described in detail in a Group
Policy document.

E.ON Group companies are responsible for preparing their
financial statements in a proper and timely manner. They
receive substantial support from Business Service Centers in

70

Regensburg, Germany, and Cluj, Romania. The financial state-
ments of subsidiaries belonging to E.ON's scope of consolidation
are audited by the subsidiaries’ respective independent auditor.
E.ON SE then combines these statements into its Consolidated
Financial Statements using uniform SAP consolidation software.
The E.ON Center of Competence for Consolidation is responsible
for conducting the consolidation and for monitoring adherence
to guidelines for scheduling, processes, and contents. Monitor-
ing of system-based automated controls is supplemented by
manual checks.

In conjunction with the year-end closing process, additional
qualitative and quantitative information is compiled. Further-
more, dedicated quality-control processes are in place for all
relevant departments to discuss and ensure the completeness
of relevant information on a regular basis.

E.ON SE's Financial Statements are also prepared with SAP
software. The accounting and preparation processes are divided
into discrete functional steps. Bookkeeping processes are handled
by our Business Service Centers: Cluj has responsibility for pro-
cesses relating to subsidiary ledgers and several bank activities,
Regensburg for those relating to the general ledgers. Auto-
mated or manual controls are integrated into each step. Defined
procedures ensure that all transactions and the preparation of
E.ON SE's Financial Statements are recorded, processed, assigned
on an accrual basis, and documented in a complete, timely,
and accurate manner. Relevant data from E.ON SE's Financial
Statements are, if necessary, adjusted to conform with IFRS
and then transferred to the consolidation software system using
SAP-supported transfer technology.

The following explanations about our Internal Control System,
and our general IT controls apply to the Consolidated Financial
Statements and E.ON SE's Financial Statements.

Internal Control System

Internal controls are an integral part of our accounting processes.
Guidelines define uniform financial-reporting requirements and
procedures for the entire E.ON Group. These guidelines encom-
pass a definition of the guidelines’ scope of application; a Risk
Catalog ("ICS Model"); standards for establishing, documenting,


--- Page 54 ---

and evaluating internal controls; a Catalog of ICS Principles; a
description of the test activities of our Internal Audit division;
and a description of the final Sign-Off process. We believe that
compliance with these rules provides sufficient certainty to pre-
vent error or fraud from resulting in material misrepresentations
in the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Combined Group
Management Report, and the Interim Reports.

COSO Framework

Our internal control system is based on the globally recognized
COSO framework, in the version published in May 2013 (COSO:
The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission). The Central Risk Catalog (ICS Model), which
encompasses company- and industry-specific aspects, defines
possible risks for accounting (financial reporting) in the functional
areas of our units and thus serves as a check list and provides
guidance for the establishment, documentation, and implemen-
tation of internal controls.

The Catalog of ICS Principles is a key component of our internal
control system, defining the minimum requirements for the
system to function. It encompasses overarching principles for
matters such as authorization, segregation of duties, and
master data management as well as specific requirements for
managing risks in a range of issue areas and processes, such as
accounting, financial reporting, communications, planning and
controlling, and risk management.

Scope

Each year, we conduct a process using qualitative criteria and
quantitative materiality metrics to define which E.ON units
must document and evaluate their financial-reporting-related
processes and controls in a central documentation system.

Central Documentation System

The E.ON units to which the internal control system applies use
acentral documentation system to document key controls. The
system defines the scope, detailed documentation requirements,
the assessment requirements for process owners, and the final
Sign-Off process.

Assessment

After E.ON units have documented their processes and controls,
the individual process owners conduct an annual assessment
of the design and the operational effectiveness of the processes
as well as the controls embedded in these processes.

Tests Performed by Internal Audit

The management of E.ON units relies on the assessment per-
formed by the process owners and on testing of the internal
control system performed by Internal Audit. These tests are a
key part of the process. Using a risk-oriented audit plan, Inter-
nal Audit tests the E.ON Group's internal control system and
identifies potential deficiencies (issues). On the basis of its own
evaluation and the results of tests performed by Internal Audit,
an E.ON unit's management carries out the final Sign-Off.

Sign-Off Process

The final step of the internal evaluation process is the submission
of a formal written declaration called a Sign-Off confirming

the effectiveness of the internal control system. The Sign-Off
process is conducted at all levels of the Group before E.ON SE,
as the final step, conducts it for the Group as a whole. The
Chairman of the E.ON SE Management Board and the Chief
Financial Officer make the final Sign-Off for the E.ON Group.

Internal Audit regularly informs the E.ON SE Supervisory Board's
Audit and Risk Committee about the internal control system for
financial reporting and any significant issue areas it identifies in
the E.ON Group's various processes.

General IT Controls

An E.ON unit called E.ON Business Services and external service
providers provide IT services for the majority of the units at

the E.ON Group. The effectiveness of the automated controls in
the standard accounting software systems and in key additional
applications depends to a considerable degree on the proper
functioning of IT systems. Consequently, IT controls are embedded
in our documentation system. These controls primarily involve
ensuring the proper functioning of access-control mechanisms
of systems and applications, of daily IT operations (such as
emergency measures), of the program change process, and of
E.ON SE's central consolidation system.

Disclosures Regarding Takeovers

Disclosures Pursuant to Section 289, Para-
graph 4, and Section 315, Paragraph 4, of the
German Commercial Code

Composition of Share Capital

The share capital totals €2,001,000,000.00 and consists of
2,001,000,000 registered shares without nominal value. Each
share of stock grants the same rights and one vote at a Share-
holders Meeting.

Restrictions on Voting Rights or the Transfer of Shares

Shares acquired by an employee under the Company-sponsored
employee stock purchase program are subject to a blackout
period that begins the day ownership of such shares is trans-
ferred to the employee and that ends on December 31 of the next
calendar year plus one. As a rule, an employee may not sell such
shares until the blackout period has expired.

Pursuant to Section 71b of the German Stock Corporation Act
("AktG"), the Company's own shares give it no rights, including
no voting rights.

Legal Provisions and Rules of the Company's Articles of Associ-
ation Regarding the Appointment and Removal of Management
Board Members and Amendments to the Articles of Association
Pursuant to the Company's Articles of Association, the Manage-
ment Board consists of at least two members. The Supervisory
Board decides on the number of members as well as on their
appointment and dismissal.

72

The Supervisory Board appoints members to the Management
Board for a term not exceeding five years; reappointment is
permissible. If more than one person is appointed as a member
of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board may appoint
one of the members as Chairperson of the Management Board.
If there is a vacancy on the Management Board for a required
member, the court makes the necessary appointment upon
petition by a concerned party in the event of an urgent matter.
The Supervisory Board may revoke the appointment of a mem-
ber of the Management Board and of the Chairperson of the
Management Board for serious cause (for further details, see
Sections 84 and 85 of the AktG).

Resolutions of the Shareholders Meeting require a majority

of the valid votes cast unless mandatory law or the Articles of
Association explicitly prescribe otherwise. An amendment to
the Articles of Association requires a two-thirds majority of the
votes cast or, in cases where at least half of the share capital is
represented, a simple majority of the votes cast unless manda-
tory law explicitly prescribes another type of majority.

The Supervisory Board is authorized to decide by resolution on
amendments to the Articles of Association that affect only their
wording (Section 10, Paragraph 7, of the Articles of Association).
Furthermore, the Supervisory Board is authorized to revise the
wording of Section 3 of the Articles of Association upon utilization
of authorized or conditional capital.


--- Page 56 ---

Management Board's Power to Issue or Buy Back Shares
Pursuant to a resolution of the Shareholders Meeting of May 3,
2012, the Company is authorized, until May 2, 2017, to acquire
own shares. The shares acquired and other own shares that are
in possession of or to be attributed to the Company pursuant to
Sections 71a et seq. of the AktG must altogether at no point
account for more than 10 percent of the Company's share capital.

At the Management Board's discretion, the acquisition may be
conducted:

e through a stock exchange

* by means of a public offer directed at all shareholders or a
public solicitation to submit offers

* by means of a public offer or a public solicitation to submit
offers for the exchange of liquid shares that are admitted to
trading on an organized market, within the meaning of the
German Securities Purchase and Takeover Law, for Company
shares

¢ by use of derivatives (put or call options or a combination of
both).

These authorizations may be utilized on one or several occasions,
in whole or in partial amounts, in pursuit of one or more objec-
tives by the Company and also by affiliated companies or by third
parties for the Company's account or its affiliates’ account.

With regard to treasury shares that will be or have been acquired
based on the above-mentioned authorization and/or prior
authorizations by the Shareholders Meeting, the Management
Board is authorized, subject to the Supervisory Board's consent
and excluding shareholder subscription rights, to use these
shares—in addition to a disposal through a stock exchange or an
offer granting a subscription right to all shareholders—as follows:

* to be sold and transferred against cash consideration
* to be sold and transferred against contribution in kind

¢ to be used in order to satisfy the rights of creditors of bonds
with conversion or option rights or, respectively, conversion
obligations issued by the Company or its Group companies

to be offered for purchase and transferred to individuals who
are employed by the Company or one of its affiliates.

These authorizations may be utilized on one or several occasions,
in whole or in partial amounts, separately or collectively by the
Company and also by Group companies or by third parties for
the Company's account or its affiliates’ account.

In addition, the Management Board is authorized to cancel
treasury shares, without such cancellation or its implementation
requiring an additional resolution by the Shareholders Meeting.


--- Page 57 ---

Disclosures Regarding Takeovers

In each case, the Management Board will inform the Shareholders
Meeting about the reasons for and the purpose of the acquisition
of treasury shares, the number of treasury shares acquired, the
amount of the registered share capital attributable to them, the
portion of the registered share capital represented by them, and
their equivalent value.

By shareholder resolution adopted at the Annual Shareholders
Meeting of May 3, 2012, the Management Board was authorized,
subject to the Supervisory Board's approval, to increase until
May 2, 2017, the Company's capital stock by a total of up to
€460 million through one or more issuances of new registered
no-par-value shares against contributions in cash and/or in kind
(with the option to restrict shareholders’ subscription rights);
such increase shall not, however, exceed the amount and number
of shares in which the authorized capital pursuant to Section 3

of the Articles of Association of E.ON AG still exists at the point
in time when the conversion of E.ON AG into a European Com-
pany ("SE") becomes effective pursuant to the conversion plan
dated March 6, 2012 (authorized capital pursuant to Sections 202
et seq. AktG). Subject to the Supervisory Board's approval, the
Management Board is authorized to exclude shareholders’ sub-
scription rights. The authorized capital increase was not utilized.

At the Annual Shareholders Meeting of May 3, 2012, share-
holders approved a conditional increase of the capital stock
(with the option to exclude shareholders’ subscription rights) in
the amount of €175 million, which is authorized until May 2,
2017. The conditional capital increase will be implemented only
to the extent required to fulfill the obligations arising on the
exercise by holders of option or conversion rights, and those
arising from compliance with the mandatory conversion of
bonds with conversion or option rights, profit participation rights
and income bonds that have been issued or guaranteed by
E.ON SE or a Group company of E.ON SE as defined by Section
18 AktG, and to the extent that no cash settlement has been
granted in lieu of conversion and no E.ON SE treasury shares
or shares of another listed company have been used to service
the rights. However, this conditional capital increase only applies
up to the amount and number of shares in which the conditional
capital pursuant to Section 3 of the Articles of Association of
E.ON AG has not yet been implemented at the point in time when
the conversion of E.ON AG into a European Company ("SE")
becomes effective in accordance with the conversion plan dated
March 6, 2012. The conditional capital increase was not utilized.

Significant Agreements to Which the Company Is a Party That
Take Effect on a Change of Control of the Company Following a
Takeover Bid

Debt issued since 2007 contains change-of-control clauses
that give the creditor the right of cancellation. This applies, inter
alia, to bonds issued by E.ON International Finance B.V. and
guaranteed by E.ON SE, promissory notes issued by E.ON SE, and
other instruments such as credit contracts. Granting change-
of-control rights to creditors is considered good corporate gov-
ernance and has become standard market practice. Further
information about financial liabilities is contained in the section
of the Combined Group Management Report entitled Financial
Situation and in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Settlement Agreements between the Company and
Management Board Members or Employees in the Case

of a Change-of-Control Event

In the event of a premature loss of a Management Board position
due to a change-of-control event, the service agreements of
Management Board members entitle them to severance and
settlement payments (see the detailed presentation in the
Compensation Report).

Achange-of-control event would also result in the early payout
of virtual shares under the E.ON Share Matching Plan.

Corporate Governance Declaration in Accor-
dance with Section 289a and Section 315,
Paragraph 5, of the German Commercial Code

Declaration Made in Accordance with Section 161 of the
German Stock Corporation Act by the Management Board

and the Supervisory Board of E.ON SE

The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board hereby
declare that E.ON SE will comply in full with the recommen-
dations of the “Government Commission German Corporate
Governance Code,” dated May 5, 2015, published by the Federal
Ministry of Justice in the official section of the Federal Gazette
(Bundesanzeiger).

The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board further-
more declare that E.ON SE has been in compliance in full with
the recommendations of the “Government Commission German
Corporate Governance Code," dated May 5, 2015, published

by the Federal Ministry of Justice in the official section of the
Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) since the last declaration on
April 15, 2016, with the exception of Section 4.2.3, Paragraph
2, Sentence 8 of the German Corporate Governance Code.

According to Section 4.2.3, Paragraph 2, Sentence 8 of the
German Corporate Governance Code, there should be no retro-
active changes to the performance targets or the comparison
parameters of the Management Board's compensation. In April
2016 the E.ON SE Supervisory Board decided to adjust the
performance targets for performance matching of the tranches
of the long-term incentive granted in 2013 to 2015 under the
E.ON Share Matching Plan. In view of the Uniper spinoff, this
adjustment was necessary for three reasons. First, the perfor-
mance targets for performance matching were linked to ROACE,
which, from the start of 2016, the Company no longer uses as a
key performance indicator. Second, the calculations were based
on old budget numbers, which did not foresee the Uniper spinoff.
Third, the anticipated reduction in E.ON’s stock price resulting
from the Uniper spinoff had to be factored in.

Relevant Information about Management Practices

Corporate Governance

E.ON views good corporate governance as a central foundation
of responsible and value-oriented management, efficient collab-
oration between the Management Board and the Supervisory
Board, transparent disclosures, and appropriate risk management.

In 2016 the Management Board and Supervisory Board paid
close attention to E.ON’s compliance with the German Corporate
Governance Code's recommendations and suggestions. They
determined that E.ON fully complies with all of the Code's rec-
ommendations, with the above-mentioned exception, and with
nearly all of its suggestions.

Transparent Management

Transparency is a high priority of the Management Board and
Supervisory Board. Our shareholders, all capital market partici-
pants, financial analysts, shareholder associations, and the media
regularly receive up-to-date information about the situation of,
and any material changes to, the Company. We primarily use
the Internet to help ensure that all investors have equal access
to comprehensive and timely information about the Company.

E.ON SE issues reports about its situation and earnings by the
following means:

¢ Interim Reports

e Annual Report

¢ Annual press conference

¢ Press releases

¢ Telephone conferences held on release of the quarterly
Interim Reports and the Annual Report

¢ Numerous events for financial analysts in and outside
Germany.

A financial calendar lists the dates on which the Company's
financial reports are released.

In addition to the Company's periodic financial reports, the
Company issues ad hoc statements when events or changes
occur at E.ON SE that could have a significant impact on the
price of E.ON stock.

The financial calendar and ad hoc statements are available on
the Internet at www.eon.com.
