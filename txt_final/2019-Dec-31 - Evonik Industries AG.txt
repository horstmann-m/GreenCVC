FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

1.1 Business model

Evonik is one of the world’s leading specialty chemicals
companies. Our strengths include the balanced spectrum of our
business activities, end-markets, and regions. Around 80 percent
of sales come from market-leading positions’, which we are
systematically expanding. Our strong competitive position is
based on close collaboration with customers, high innovative
capability, and integrated technology platforms.

Our specialty chemicals products make an indispensable con-
tribution to the benefits of our customers’ products, which gen-
erate their success in global competition. Close cooperation with
our customers enables us to build up a deep knowledge of their
business, so we can offer products tailored to their specifications
and extensive technical service. Our technology centers and
customer competence centers play an important role in this
around the world.

Market-oriented research and development is a key driver of
profitable growth. This is based on our strong innovation culture,
which is rooted in our innovation management and management
development. Good ideas are rapidly recognized, driven forward,
and implemented with our customers.

Highly trained employees are a key success factor. They
drive forward the company on a daily basis through their hard
work and identification. We have therefore developed a wide
range of activities to gain and develop talented and qualified
employees and to position Evonik as a preferred employer in
order to retain them.

As preconditions for Evonik’s future viability, sustainable
business activities, and responsible conduct are cornerstones of
our business model. We drive forward our sustainability activities
along the value chain in intensive dialogue with our stakeholders.
As well as our own production processes and the products we
market, we always consider the supply chain and the product

benefits for our customers and their customers. We have
observed rising demand for products that demonstrate a good
balance of economic, ecological, and social factors. That opens
up a broad spectrum of future-oriented business opportunities
for Evonik in attractive markets. Sustainability has long been a
growth driver in many of our businesses.

In the light of this, we adopted our new Sustainability Strategy
2020+. Key elements are integrating sustainability into strategic
management processes, carbon pricing for all investments, and
ambitious targets for the reduction of CO emissions and the
introduction of global water management.

New corporate structure

In the reporting period, our specialty chemicals operations were
divided into three chemical manufacturing segments. These
operate close to their markets, and customers and have a high
degree of entrepreneurial independence. They are supported by
a Services segment.

1 We define these as ranking 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in the relevant markets. Source: internal analyses based on 2018.

The Nutrition & Care and Resource Efficiency segments operate
principally in attractive markets with above-average growth
rates. Both segments offer customers customized, innovation-
driven solutions and the aim is for them to achieve above-
average, profitable growth through innovations, investments, and
acquisitions.

The Performance Materials segment is characterized by pro-
cesses that make intensive use of energy and raw materials. It
therefore concentrates on integrated, cost-optimized technology
platforms, efficient workflows, and economies of scale. Our
strategic goal for this segment is to contribute earnings to finance
the growth of the Evonik Group. Investments and, where
appropriate, alliances concentrate on securing and extending our
good market positions.

As of July 1, 2020, our corporate structure will be reorganized
and aligned to our four growth engines. The size and profitability
of the new chemical divisions will be more balanced and they
will be easier to manage thanks to a clearer alignment to tech-
nology platforms.

Most of our customers are industrial companies that use our
products for further processing. The range of markets in which
they operate is diverse and balanced. None of these end-markets
accounts for more than 20 percent of our sales.

Global production

Evonik has a presence in more than 100 countries, and 83 percent
of sales are generated outside Germany. We have production
facilities in 26 countries on six continents and are therefore close
to our markets and our customers. Our largest production sites,
for example, Marl, Wesseling, and Rheinfelden (Germany),
Antwerp (Belgium), Mobile (Alabama, USA), Shanghai (China),
and Singapore, have integrated technology platforms used by
various units.

Main table of contents

Integrated technology platforms are a competitive
advantage

Our products are manufactured using highly developed technol-
ogies that we are constantly refining. Evonik has many integrated
production complexes where key precursors are produced in
neighboring production facilities. In this way, we offer our
customers maximum reliability of supply. At the same time,
integrated world-scale production facilities combined with
technologically demanding production processes act as high
entry barriers.

Digitalization contributes to profitable growth
Digitalization includes fundamental changes to processes in the
chemical industry. For example, it is altering processes in the pro-
curement of raw materials, the operation of production facilities,
marketing and sales, and research and development. The use of
artificial intelligence, for instance, in the planning and optimiza-
tion of production facilities, offers potential for an enormous
improvement in efficiency and effectiveness.

Evonik is driving forward digitalization throughout the
Group. We regard digitalization as a structural task and are net-
working the various decentralized initiatives to make sure that
different organizational units and their digital projects can learn
from each other and to promote the growth of broadly based
digital expertise at Evonik. Our activities are grouped in four
clusters (#CognitiveSolutions, #DigitalBusiness, #Smart-
Operations, #HumanWork). These are all geared to raising the
efficiency of our processes and utilizing opportunities. Our guiding
principles for digitalization set out how we intend to embrace
digitalization.

The role of Evonik Digital GmbH is to test new business
models and solutions quickly and flexibly in order to evaluate
their benefits. In particular, it develops powerful e-commerce
solutions and platforms and digital service offerings. These
projects are the basis for establishing, bundling, and expanding
digital expertise and agile working methods. Great importance is
attached to upskilling our employees for the digital world.

1.2 Principles and objectives

Building a best-in-class specialty chemicals company
We want to make Evonik a best-in-class specialty chemicals
company. This global aspiration is closely linked to our goal of
profitable growth. To increase the value of our company, our
strategy has the following three focal areas:

+ Amore balanced and more specialty portfolio

+ Leading in innovation

+ An open and performance-oriented culture

Our goal is to step up our focus on businesses with clear specialty
chemicals with clear specialty chemicals’ characteristics. To ensure
an even better balance within our portfolio and to grow in areas
where Evonik is already strong but where the prospects are still
especially promising, our strategy concentrates on four growth
engines: Specialty Additives, Animal Nutrition, Health & Care,
and Smart Materials. We will be aligning our corporate structure
to them from July 1, 2020.

Capital allocation for new developments and enhancements,
investments, and acquisitions will be concentrated principally on
these growth engines. Each of the four growth engines focuses
on different markets, but they have one thing in common: They
are aligned consistently to delivering innovative solutions for
issues and developments of relevance to industry and end-
customers in the coming decades.

Innovation is an important driver of profitable growth as it lever-
ages the development of new products and applications. Our
focus here is on working intensively with customers and partners
along the supply chain. Within the four growth engines, Evonik

Specialty Additives: Specialty additives improve the properties
of countless everyday products. Small quantities of these
additives are used in production processes to achieve a variety
of different effects, for example, to regulate the hardness of
cushioning or the viscosity of lubricants.

Animal Nutrition: Sustainable food production is one of the big
challenges of our time. Globally, meat production is increasing
as a result of rising living standards in emerging markets.
Consequently, more land is being required for farming, and
methane gas emissions from cattle are increasing. Evonik
already offers many solutions to address this development.
Markets are also influenced by the desire for safer and better-

The third element is a performance-oriented culture based on our
new corporate values: performance, trust, openness, and speed.
We initiate change, keep our promises, reward performance and
readiness to take risks, foster thinking outside the box, and are
open to new ideas. We are agile, decisive, and quick to react. We

nutrition.

Health & Care: This growth engine comprises products and
services for pharmaceuticals, medical technology, cosmetics,
and nutritional supplements. Examples are pharmaceutical
polymers, which release the active ingredients in medicines in
the body exactly when and where they are needed.

Smart Materials: Smart materials have specially tailored func
tionalities that help to optimize products and product properties.
Examples are silica and polyamide 12.

As a responsible specialty chemicals company, we are also con-
tinuing to pursue our ambitious non-financial targets '. Since we
achieved our target for the reduction in specific greenhouse gas
emissions ahead of schedule, we have adopted a new environ-
mental target. Our target is a 50 percent reduction in absolute
scope 1 and 23 emissions by 2025 compared with the level in
2008—the first full year after the establishment of Evonik. This
affirms our commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate
Change.

1.3 Business management systems

Most important financial key performance indicators
Financial management of Evonik is based on a consistent system
of value-oriented indicators. These are used to assess the busi-
ness performance of the operational units and the Evonik Group.
Through systematic alignment to these indicators, Evonik
endeavors to create value by raising profitability and ensuring
profitable growth.

We use adjusted EBITDA (i.e., EBITDA after factoring out
special items) as a financial performance indicator. Adjusted
EBITDA and the corresponding relative indicator, the adjusted
EBITDA margin, show operating performance irrespective of the
structure of the assets and the investment profile. We use this, in
particular, for internal and external comparisons of the cost struc-
ture and profitability of our businesses.

The return on capital employed (ROCE) is used as a further
indicator of value-driven management of the company. It is cal-
culated from adjusted EBIT in relation to average capital
employed. Comparison with the cost of capital, which shows the
risk-adjusted return expectations of our investors, indicates rela-
tive value creation. This is calculated using a weighted average
cost of capital, which reflects the return expectations of both
shareholders, derived from the capital asset pricing model, and
providers of debt capital.

3 Scope 1 comprises direct energy and process emissions, and scope 2 comprises emissions from purchased electricity and heat.
Scope 3 contains indirect emissions such as emissions from the production of purchased raw materials.

4 See section 5.2 Safety a p.47f.

Main table of contents

The special items that are factored out when calculating adjusted
EBITDA and adjusted EBIT include restructuring, impairment
losses/reversals of impairment losses, income and expenses in
connection with the purchase/ disposal of investments in compa-
nies, and other income and expense items that, due to their
nature or amount, do not reflect the typical operating business.
We consider that the adjusted earnings figures are more suitable
than unadjusted data for comparing the performance of operat-
ing units over several periods.

We also use free cash flow as an operational performance
indicator. This is calculated from the cash flow from operating
activities, continuing operations, less outflows for capital expen-
ditures on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment. The
free cash flow shows the remaining scope for financing. It there-
fore shows the company’s internal financing capacity.

Most important non-financial key performance
indicators

Evonik also uses a wide variety of non-financial performance
indicators. Traditionally, we accord special significance to safety,
which is regarded as a holistic management task that has to be
lived at all management levels. Our guiding principles for safety
are binding for staff at all levels. In accordance with corporate
policy, all organizational units at Evonik have an occupational
safety target. In addition, all production units have a plant safety
target. The relevant indicators are accident frequency and
incident frequency. *

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

2.1 Overall assessment of the economic
situation

Strategically, we made considerable progress in the ongoing
development of Evonik in 2019. We sharpened our focus on
specialty chemicals at the end of July by divesting the meth-
acrylates business, comprising large-volume monomers such as
methylmethacrylate (MMA), various specialty monomers, and
the PLEXIGLAS® brand of PMMA molding compounds and
semi-finished products. Our strategy is focused on our four
growth engines—Specialty Additives, Animal Nutrition, Health
& Care, and Smart Materials—where we are concentrating our
investments. With effect from July 1, 2020, we will be aligning
our corporate structure to the growth engines.

Major capital expenditures capital expenditures such as
those for the construction of construction of the methionine
complex in Singapore and the AEROSIL® facility in Antwerp
(Belgium) have been completed. In 2019, we embarked on signif-
icant new projects. These include construction of a production
complex for polyamide 12 specialty polymers in Marl (Germany)—
the biggest investment in Germany in Evonik’s history—and the
construction of a modern gas and steam turbine power plant, also
in Marl. In addition, we strengthened our hydrogen peroxide
activities by acquiring the US company PeroxyChem at the start
of 2020.

Since global economic conditions remain challenging, we are
working consistently to make our structures leaner and to

2 See notes 3.4 [) p.104f. and 9.2 [) p.145f.

enhance efficiency. We have made good headway with the
SG&A 2020 program’ introduced at the end of 2017 with the
aim of global optimization of processes and a lasting reduction in
selling and administrative expenses. The Oleo2020 program and
other activities to enhance efficiency are also making good
progress. We expect further impetus to come from the cultural
change towards a more open, performance-oriented corporate
culture.

Operationally, Evonik held up well in a challenging economic
environment and achieved its forecast for key performance
indicators. Demand for our specialty chemical products remained
strong worldwide. In all, sales slipped 1 percent to €13,108 million,
with volumes and selling prices down slightly.

Adjusted EBITDA was around the prior-year level at
€2,153 million. Positive effects came from cost-cutting measures
and the initial application of IFRS 16 Leases*. However, earnings
were held back by price erosion in the Nutrition & Care and
Performance Materials segments.

The adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 16.4 percent
(2018: 16.2 percent) but was nevertheless below the target
mid-term range of 18 percent to 20 percent. ROCE declined,
principally as a consequence of lower adjusted EBIT, accompanied
by an increase in capital employed to 8.6 percent, and ROCE was
below the cost of capital.

Net income improved by 126 percent to €2,106 million
thanks to the income from the divestment of the methacrylates
business. Adjusted net income, continuing operations, was

11 percent lower at €902 million. At the annual shareholders’
meeting, the executive board and supervisory board will again
propose a dividend of €1.15 per share.

We generated a free cash flow of €717 million before one-off
tax payments relating to the carve-out of the methacrylates busi-
ness. The year-on-year improvement of €191 million was due in
part to initial application of IFRS 16. The free cash flow before
these tax payments exceeded the dividend payout of €536 million
for 2018.

Our financial profile is still very good: Evonik has a solid
investment grade rating. Net financial debt was reduced signifi-
cantly thanks to the receipt of the proceeds of the divestment of
the methacrylates business.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

2.2 Economic background

Considerably lower global economic momentum

The development of global economic conditions was poorer
than we had anticipated at the start of the year. We estimate that
the global economy as a whole grew by around 2.6 percent in
2019. At the start of the year, we had forecast growth of 2.9 per-
cent. In 2019, the economy therefore grew considerably more
slowly than in the previous year, when growth was still 3.2 per-
cent.

Trade conflicts, stagnating global trade, and the uncertainty
arising from Brexit, which had been postponed several times, led
to a drop in investment and industrial output, especially in the
industrialized countries. However, first signs of economic stabili-
zation towards year-end led to a slight improvement in senti-
ment. This was driven by an initial rapprochement in the trade
dispute between the USA and China and the continued expan-
sionary central bank policy.

In Western Europe, economic momentum slowed further, and
industrial output declined significantly. This was attributable to
the dependence on exports and global trade flows, especially in
Germany. The European Central Bank continued its expansionary
policy, including a decision to resume bond purchases in Septem-
ber. Together with the continued good employment situation and
the resulting stable consumer behavior, this provided positive
growth impetus, resulting in a slight stabilization of the economic
situation at the end of the year.

Growth also slowed in Eastern Europe, mainly due to less
dynamic growth in Turkey and Russia. By contrast, some econo-
mies, such as Poland and Hungary, reported robust growth,
driven principally by rising wages.

Growth in North America was very stable at first, driven mainly by
the US economy, but lost momentum at year-end. The reasons for
this were the end of the fiscal policy impact of the 2018 tax reform
and a drop in exports and investment. In view of the deteriorating
economic situation, the Federal Reserve started to cut interest
rates in the summer. The key interest rate was reduced by a total of
0.75 percentage points in three steps to 1.5 percent.

Economic momentum in Central & South America was low in
2019. Contributory factors included the weakness of global trade
and declining worldwide demand, which had a negative impact
on export-oriented raw material suppliers. Growth was also held
back by political uncertainty. Following the interest rate cuts in
the USA, many central banks in Central & South America were
also able to cut rates to counter the economic downturn.

Business review
Economic background

The Asia-Pacific region posted slower growth than in the previous
year. In Japan, strong domestic demand brought an improvement
in economic momentum. In China, economic growth was probably
6.1 percent, the lowest since 1992, mainly as a result of the trade
dispute with the USA.

Weaker development of end-customer industries
Worldwide, the development of Evonik’s end-customer indus-
tries differed by region and by sector in 2019. We anticipate that
overall industrial growth was lower than in the previous year.

Demand for consumer and care products increased signifi-
cantly in the Asia-Pacific region and was also slightly higher in
Europe. By contrast, demand declined in North America and
Central & South America. Growth momentum in the food and
feed sectors gained pace in all regions, especially Asia-Pacific. By
contrast, automotive and mechanical engineering output declined
considerably in Europe and was also lower in North America. In
the construction sector, growth remained high in Europe and
Asia-Pacific.

Raw material prices fell slightly in 2019, mainly because of the
slowdown in the global economy, which resulted in lower
demand for raw materials. Prices for fossil-based raw materials
dropped analogously to the price of crude oil, especially between
May and August. Overall, Evonik’s raw material price index was
lower than in the previous year.

The average annual exchange rate for the euro against Evonik’s
most important currency—the US dollar—decreased to US$1.12,
compared with an average exchange rate of USS1.18 in the pre-
vious year.

2.3 Major events

As part of the consistent implementation of our corporate strategy,
on July 31, 2019 we divested the methacrylates business to
Advent International Corporation, Boston (Massachusetts, USA)".
The methacrylates business was reclassified to discontinued
operations following signature of the sale agreement in March
2019 and deconsolidated as of July 31, 2019. The prior-year
figures have been restated in the income statement, cash flow
statement, and the key figures used for management purposes.
The methacrylates business comprised large-volume monomers
such as methylmethacrylate (MMA), various specialty monomers,
and the PLEXIGLAS® brand of PMMA molding compounds and
semi-finished products. Most of the business was allocated to the
Performance Materials segment, and a small part was allocated
to the Resource Efficiency segment.

At the end of 2018, Evonik signed an agreement with One
Equity Partners to acquire the US company PeroxyChem.
PeroxyChem is a manufacturer of hydrogen peroxide and
peracetic acid and is well-positioned in high-margin specialty
applications. The acquisition of PeroxyChem was planned for
summer 2019 but was delayed by a lawsuit filed by the Federal
Trade Commission (FTC) in the USA. The case was dismissed in
January 2020, and and the US$640 million acquisition was closed
on February 3, 2020. 2

positive impact. By contrast, negative effects came from lower
prices for amino acids in the Nutrition & Care segment and
C4 chemicals in the Performance Materials segment. The
adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 16.4 percent, up from
16.2 percent in 2018.

Prior-year figures restated.

The adjusted EBITDA reported by corporate, other operations,
including consolidation, contains, among other things, expenses
for the corporate center and strategic research. The successful
cost-saving measures were a significant factor in the year-on-
year improvement.

As a result of initial application of IFRS 16 with effect from
January 1, 2019, depreciation includes depreciation of right-of-
use assets amounting to €130 million. Adjusted EBIT dropped
12 percent to €1,201 million.

The adjustments totaled —€115 million, compared with
—€312 million in 2018. Impairment losses of —€47 million mainly
related to the coal-fired power plant in Marl (Germany), which is
to be replaced by a natural gas-fired plant in 2022, and one

investment in the Nutrition & Care segment. Further adjustments
of —€30 million related to the acquisition/divestment of share-
holdings, specifically the divestment of the methacrylates business,
the planned acquisition of PeroxyChem, and the integration of
the Air Products specialty additives business. The restructuring
expenses of €18 million were incurred for the SG&A 2020
program to reduce selling and administrative expenses, and the
Oleo 2020 project to raise the efficiency of oleochemicals in the
Nutrition & Care segment. The prior-year adjustments of
—€312 million principally comprised restructuring expenses,
mainly relating to the SG&A 2020 program. In addition, they
contained project expenses for the purchase of equity investments.

The financial result improved to —€132 million. It contains
special items of €53 million, mainly from the reversal of provisions.
The adjusted financial result deteriorated by €34 million to
—€185 million due to higher interest expense for provisions and
the initial application of IFRS 16 (€16 million).

Income before income taxes, continuing operations, rose
7 percent to €954 million. The income tax rate on the continuing
operations was 19 percent, and the adjusted income tax rate was
20 percent, partly as a result of the remeasurement of deferred
tax assets. Income after taxes, discontinued operations, contains
the methacrylates business and increased from €246 million to
€1,353 million thanks to the high divestment gain.

Net income therefore improved by 126 percent to
€2,106 million.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

We use adjusted net income to assess the earnings power of the
continuing operations, especially on a long-term view, and to fore-
cast future development. The calculation starts from EBITDA after
adjustment for special items". The financial result is then adjusted
for income and expenses in connection with the purchase/disposal
of equity investments and other income and expense items that, by
nature or amount, do not form part of typical current financing
activities. Further, we deduct amortization of intangible assets,

which mainly results from acquisitions, and adjust income tax for
taxes on special items.

In 2019, adjusted net income was €902 million, down 11 per-
cent from the high level reported for 2018.

Cost-saving programs exceeded targets in 2019
To support our financial targets, especially the improvement in
the adjusted EBITDA margin, we introduced the SG&A 2020

program in November 2017. The aim is to achieve a lasting
reduction of €200 million in selling and administrative expenses
by 2021. The target of €50 million set for 2019 was exceeded by
almost €20 million. By year-end 2019, measures had been iden-
tified for all savings still required to meet the overall target of
€200 million.

The measures implemented through the ongoing program of
continuous improvements in process efficiency, especially in the
production function, exceeded the savings target of €120 million
in 2019. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we took effec-
tive short-term steps to secure earnings.

Efficient and effective procurement

Reliable supply, gaining access to new procurement markets, and
ongoing optimization of material costs are key tasks for our pro-
curement function.

Planned and unplanned production shutdowns by key sup-
pliers, production shortfalls in China resulting from plant clo-
sures as a consequence of more restrictive environmental policy,
and the trade dispute between the USA and China restricted the
availability of raw materials in 2019. Nevertheless, the lower
pace of growth in the global economy and the related reduction
in demand for materials resulted in lower average annual raw
material prices compared with 2018.

As part of an all-round optimization of the procurement of raw
materials, demand for very small quantities was bundled in the
tender process for the first time at the end of 2019. The objective
is to greatly improve workflows and reduce primary costs.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

For indirect procurement (procurement of general and technical
goods and services), worldwide introduction of a new cloud-
based IT solution for catalog orders was completed in 2019. As a
consequence, further progress was made in increasing the level
of automation. Another focus of indirect procurement in 2019
was procurement for the new polyamide 12 plant in Marl
(Germany).

The procurement function continued to drive forward the use
of new digital solutions in 2019 to automate further operational
tasks (for example, with the aid of bots) and to increase the value
contributed to strategic activities. This included introducing a
cloud-based platform to forecast raw material prices, accompa-
nied by automated reporting. For key strategic raw materials,
data-based raw material price forecasts with self-learning algo-
rithms was developed and introduced step by step in order to
improve the quality and objectiveness of price forecasts.

As well as participating in procurement alliances with other
companies and validating new suppliers, we worked intensively
to extend strategic relationships with suppliers. In our relation-
ship with strategic suppliers, the focal areas are finding additional
ways of reducing risk, enhancing the cost situation, cooperation,
and innovation.

In 2019, Evonik spent around €9.4 billion on raw materials
and supplies, technical goods, services, energy, and other oper-
ating supplies. Raw materials make up around 55 percent of pro-
curement volume. Spending on petrochemical feedstocks is
around €3.4 billion and accounts for 66 percent of our raw mate-
rial base.

Using renewable resources remains very important to Evonik.
In 2019, renewables accounted for around 8 percent of raw
materials. The main applications for these raw materials are
amino acids and starting products for the cosmetics industry.

Return on capital employed lower than

in previous year

Within our value-oriented management approach, our success is
measured principally by ROCE, which was 8.6 percent in 2019
and therefore below our cost of capital, which was 10.0 percent
before taxes. In our regular review, it will be adjusted to 9.0 per-
cent before taxes for 2020 as a result of lower borrowing costs
and a lower beta factor.

The average capital employed increased by €0.7 billion to
€14.0 billion. The main factors here were the right-of-use assets
for leases recognized in accordance with IFRS 16 for the first
time, and capital expenditures for our operating business.

The Evonik Group’s ROCE declined in 2019 as a result of
lower EBIT and higher average capital employed. ROCE declined
in all of the chemical segments. In the Resource Efficiency and
Performance Materials segments, however, ROCE was above
average and well above the cost of capital.

Economic value added (EVA®) is the difference between
adjusted EBIT and the cost of capital, which is calculated by
multiplying average capital employed by the average cost of
capital (WACC). EVA® was —€203 million in 2019. The year-on-
year decline of €235 million was a consequence of the lower
operating result and higher capital employed.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

2.5 Comparison of forecast and actual
performance

Following the reclassification of the methacrylates business to
discontinued operations in March 2019, we adjusted the forecast
made at the start of the year and issued a new forecast for the
continuing operations only in May 2019. At the start of November,
we revised our forecast for sales, ROCE, and capital expenditures
in the light of the weaker economic situation.

In 2019, adjusted EBITDA was €2,153 million, so we met our
forecast despite the challenging global economic conditions. As
announced in August 2019, the free cash flow refers to the free
cash flow before one-time tax payments of €245 million in
connection with the carve-out of the methacrylates business,
because these relate to the divestment of the discontinued oper-
ations and not to the continuing operations. The free cash flow
after adjustment for these tax payments increased significantly
from €526 million to €717 million as forecast. The free cash flow
after the tax payments was €472 million, which was below the
prior-year level.

Comparison of forecast and actual performance

Group sales decreased by 1 percent to €13.1 billion, which was in
line with the revised forecast. ROCE fell to 8.6 percent in 2019
and was thus perceptibly lower than the cost of capital and the
prior-year figure. Here, the increase in capital employed was a
negative factor. In response to the challenging economic situation,
we reduced our capital expenditures to €842 million, so the
reduction was slightly more than had been forecast.

In 2019, we once again achieved our targets for our non-
financial indicators: accident frequency and incident frequency.

Slightly higher volumes
In the Nutrition & Care segment, sales fell 1 percent to
€4,582 million. Global demand was high. The decline was caused
by lower selling prices, while volumes increased slightly. Cur-

Essential amino acids for animal nutrition posted considerably
lower sales. While volumes developed positively, there was a
further drop in selling prices, especially for methionine, due to
adequate availability of this product on the market. The measures

making good progress. The care solutions business generated
sales on a par with the previous year. The specialties in the
cosmetic solutions product line developed well. The restructuring
at the start of 2019 to raise efficiency and leverage synergies is
already proving successful. Sales of additives for polyurethane
foam increased, with a particularly very good volume trend in
products used, for example, in mattresses and insulating materials.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

Capital expenditures below the high prior-year level
Capital expenditures in the Nutrition & Care segment amounted
to €260 million. That was below the high prior-year level, which
contained a high proportion of the investment in an additional
world-scale production complex for methionine in Singapore.
Capital expenditures were therefore below depreciation and
amortization, which was €311 million. The average capital
employed increased to €5,044 million, principally due to capital
expenditures in the previous year. ROCE declined substantially to
8.0 percent as a result of lower earnings and higher capital
employed.

Investment projects to drive growth
In view of the strong growth in the market for methionine,
Nutrition & Care invested around half a billion euros in a further
production complex in Singapore, which came on stream in the
summer. This fully backwardly integrated production complex,
including the production of all precursors and intermediates, is
located directly next to, and integrated into, the facility that came
into service in November 2014.

In November 2019, the Veramaris joint venture established
by Evonik and Royal DSM, Heerlen (Netherlands) completed a
plant to produce omega-3 fatty acids from natural sea algae.
Together, the two partners invested around US$200 million in
this plant at Evonik’s site in Blair (Nebraska, USA), where it has
access to decades of experience of industrial fermentation tech-
nology. The highly concentrated algal oil produced by Veramaris
enables the animal feed industry to keep pace with rising demand
for these essential omega-3 fatty acids. At the same time, the use
of fish oil from stocks of wild fish can be reduced or replaced.

Both investments strengthen the Animal Nutrition growth
engine.

To strengthen our Health & Care growth engine, we have
acquired the patented Endexo® technology from Interface Bio-
logics, a material science company in Toronto (Canada). Endexo®
enhances the biocompatibility of medical devices such as catheters

Sales at the prior-year level

The Resource Efficiency segment held up well overall in the
challenging economic environment. Sales were €5,685 million,
which was around the prior-year level. A slight drop in volumes
was almost entirely offset by higher selling prices and positive
currency effects.

Business with coating additives, coating and adhesive resins,
and oil additives was adversely affected by the global economic
downturn, especially in the automotive and coatings sectors, and
sales were considerably lower than in the previous year. Lower
volumes were also reported by the silica business, particularly

in industry-oriented areas. By contrast, the business with high-
performance polymers generated higher sales, benefiting from
solid demand and a positive trend, especially in 3D printing
and membranes. Crosslinkers, which are mainly used for
environment-friendly paint systems/coatings, high-performance
composites, and specialty plastics, increased sales, principally as
consequence of high demand from the wind power market,
especially in China. Hydrogen peroxide products benefited
from a good development in conventional applications and
license revenues, and also posted higher sales.

19.3 percent.

Investment projects to expand market positions

In summer 2019, a new production facility for fumed silica came
into service in Antwerp (Belgium). Investment was in the high
double-digit million euro range. Typical applications for this
specialty silica, which Evonik markets as AEROSIL®, are paints,
coatings, modern adhesive systems, transparent silicones, and
non-combustible high-performance insulating materials. In
Zhenjiang (Jiangsu Province, China), Evonik Wynca (Zhenjiang)
Silicon Material Co., Ltd., a joint venture with the Chinese
company Wynca, started construction of a new production
facility for AEROSIL®. This is scheduled to come into service in
2020 and will further extend our global production network for
fumed silica, ensuring more stable supply to our customers in
China. We are currently expanding production capacity for
precipitated silica in Adapazari (Turkey). This is scheduled for
completion in 2020. Silica is mainly used in high-quality tires
with low rolling resistance. Other areas of application are the
food, feed, and agriculture industries. Precipitated and fumed
silicas belong to the Smart Materials growth engine.

In Marl (Germany), we have commenced construction work
on a new production complex for the specialty polymer poly-
amide 12 (PA 12). We are investing more than €400 million in
this complex, which will increase our total PA 12 capacity by
more than 50 percent. Alongside the present PA 12 production

polymer is used in strategic global growth markets such as 3D
printing. This lightweight, durable polymer makes a key contri-
bution to saving resources in automotive engineering as well.
Thanks to its outstanding properties—high stability combined
with flexibility, as well as high temperature resistance and low
weight—this high-performance polymer is used as a substitute
for steel in many demanding applications. This investment also
strengthens the Smart Materials growth engine.

In response to rising demand for lightweight structural mate-
rials for specialty applications, we are extending production of the
ROHACELL® brand of high-performance rigid foams at our site in
Mobile (Alabama, USA). The capacity expansion is scheduled for
completion in the fourth quarter of 2020. ROHACELL® is a rigid
structural foam made of polymethacrylimide, which is used
in construction and in the manufacture sandwich elements for
aviation, automobiles, ships, sports equipment, electronics, and
medical technology. This extremely light foam is resistant to
elevated temperatures and high pressure, making it ideal as a core
component in composites.

Higher adjusted EBITDA margin

Adjusted EBITDA was down 6 percent year-on-year at €224 mil-
lion. Both years were dominated by special items: In 2019,
bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials and plant outages had
a negative impact, while in 2018 the main impact was the low
water level of the river Rhine. The adjusted EBITDA margin
improved from 10.7 percent to 11.0 percent as earnings did not
fall as fast as sales.

The average capital employed increased by 16 percent to
€707 million. ROCE declined substantially, from 29.4 percent to

Focused investment

Performance Materials plans to raise capacity for sodium methylate
in Rosario (Argentina) by 50 percent to 90,000 metric tons p.a.
Sodium methylate is an important catalyst for industrial production
of biodiesel. The expansion is designed to meet the rising
demand for biodiesel in South America, especially in Argentina
and Brazil. The background is the planned increase in the addition
of biodiesel to fuel in Brazil and the increasing competitiveness
of biodiesel exports from Argentina. At the same time, the
expansion strengthens our global market leadership.

plant is to be built at Marl Chemical Park in Germany by 2022.
This will end Evonik’s coal-fired generation of electricity and
steam and cut CO emissions by up to 1 million metric tons a year.
The contracts with our partner, Siemens, were signed at the
end of August 2019. Siemens is responsible for planning and
construction of the entire two-block power plant. This highly
efficient and flexible co-generation plant for electricity and
steam will have efficiency of over 90 percent. Investment will be
in the triple-digit million euro range. The new plant safeguards
cost-effective and future-oriented energy supply at Evonik’s larg-
est production site, Marl Chemical Park. In addition to power
generation, the generation of steam is particularly important for
production at the chemical park. Highly flexible load management
means the plant can play a part in compensating for fluctuations in
the amount of energy from renewable resources fed into the
power network, which is a key building block in Germany’s new

energy policy.

2.7 Regional development

A global presence
We generated 83 percent of sales outside Germany in 2019.

Sales in Western Europe declined 3 percent year-on-year to
€5,531 million. All three chemical segments reported lower sales.
Western Europe accounted for 42 percent of Group sales.

Investment was once again concentrated on Western Europe.
Capital expenditures were €547 million, which was above the
previous year’s level of 424 million. Capacity for fumed silica in
Antwerp (Belgium) was increased in summer 2019. In Marl
(Germany), we are building a new production complex for the
specialty polymer polyamide 12. This is scheduled to start operat-
ing in early 2021.

In Eastern Europe, sales increased 3 percent to €814 million,
with higher sales coming from the Resource Efficiency and
Performance Materials segments. This region’s share of Group
sales was 6 percent.

In the Middle East & Africa region, sales dropped 9 percent
to €355 million, which was 3 percent of Group sales.

Sales unchanged in the Americas

Sales in North America were at the prior-year level of
€2,952 million. Lower sales from the Performance Materials
segment were offset by higher sales from the growth segments.
This region accounted for 23 percent of Group sales. Capital
expenditures were €137 million, which was below the previous
year’s level (€199 million).

Sales declined 3 percent to €591 million in Central & South
America. This region accounted for 5 percent of Group sales.

Higher sales in the Asia-Pacific region

Sales rose 4 percent to €2,042 million in the Asia-Pacific North
region, with the Nutrition & Care and Resource Efficiency seg-
ments both contributing pleasing sales growth. This region

totaled €66 million.

Sales in Asia-Pacific South were 3 percent lower at €823 mil-
lion, which was 6 percent of Group sales. Capital expenditures
were €70 million. The prior-year figure of €303 million mainly
related to the construction of the world-scale production com-
plex for methionine, which was taken into service in mid-2019.

2.8 Earnings position

Income before income taxes, continuing operations
slightly higher than in prior year

In all, sales slipped 1 percent to €13.1 billion, with volumes and
selling prices down slightly. The cost of sales increased, partly due
to expenses for the start-up of new production capacities. The
gross profit on sales fell 8 percent to €3.7 billion. The success of
our ongoing SG&A 2020 cost-saving program made a significant
contribution to the reduction in selling and general administrative
expenses. Research and development expenses declined, partly as
a result of more focused alignment of R&D activities. The
increase in other operating income was principally attributable to
income from the reversal of provisions following reassessment of
the provisions for SG&A 2020. The reduction in other operating
expenses was mainly due to lower restructuring expenses and
lower project expenses in connection with the acquisition of
business operations. Income before financial result and income
taxes was 4 percent higher at €1,086 million, principally because
of the lower net result of other operating income and expense.

Considerably higher net income

The financial result includes special items totaling €53 million,
compared with —€3 million in the previous year. Income before
income taxes, continuing operations, increased 7 percent to
€954 million. Income taxes were around the same level as in
the previous year. Income after taxes, discontinued operations,
contains the methacrylates business and was considerably higher
than in 2018 due to the divestment gain. Non-controlling interests

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

2.9 Financial condition

Central financial management

The principal objectives of financial management are safeguard-
ing the financial independence of the Evonik Group and limiting
financial risks. We therefore apply a central financing strategy.
Borrowing and bond issuance are normally undertaken by Evonik
Industries AG or its financing company, Evonik Finance B.V.,
Amsterdam (Netherlands). The liabilities of this company are
fully guaranteed by Evonik Industries AG. To reduce external
borrowing, surplus liquidity at Group companies is placed in a
cash pool at Group level to cover financing requirements in other
Group companies through intragroup loans. Currency derivatives
are used at Group level to hedge intragroup loans. Evonik has a
flexible range of corporate financing instruments to meet liquid-
ity requirements for day-to-day business, investments, and the
repayment of financial debt.

Solid investment grade rating confirmed

Both Moody’s and Standard & Poor's (S&P) confirmed their
credit ratings for Evonik Industries AG in 2019. Moody's rating is
still Baal and S&P still rates Evonik BBB+, with a stable outlook
in both cases. Maintaining a solid investment grade rating is a
central element in our financing strategy. In this way we gain
access to a broad investor base on appropriate financing terms

and thus maintain our financial flexibility. A solid investment
grade rating gives banks, investors, customers, and suppliers a
reliable basis for a long-term business relationship with Evonik.

Attractive level of free cash flow

The cash flow from operating activities, continuing operations,
decreased by €122 million to €1,352 million. The reduction was
mainly due to one-time tax payments of €245 million in connec
tion with the carve-out of the methacrylates business. Without
this necessary preparation for the divestment, the cash flow
would have risen by €123 million. The principal positive factors
were a perceptible reduction in net working capital and the initial
application of IFRS 16 (€142 million).

The situation with regard to the change in the free cash flow
was similar: While it declined by €54 million to €472 million due
to the one-time tax payments, the free cash flow before tax pay-
ments relating to the carve-out of the methacrylates business
rose by €191 million to €717 million. A reduction of €68 million
in cash outflows for investing activities contributed to the pleasing
development of the internal financing capacity of our operating
business.

The other investments resulted in a cash inflow of €635 million.
The cash inflow from the divestment of the methacrylates business
was reduced by investing part of the proceeds in current securities.

Financial condition

Significant reduction in net financial debt

Net financial debt was reduced significantly to €2,141 million, a
reduction of €1,432 million compared with January 1, 2019. This
was principally due to the purchase price received for the meth-
acrylates business and the improvement in the free cash flow
before tax payments relating to the carve-out of this business.
Countereffects included the tax payments in connection with the
carve-out, payment of the dividend for 2018 (€536 million),
and the acquisition of shares in Vivawest from the CTA (Evonik
Pensionstreuhand e.V.) due to a change in the strategy for
pension assets.

Corporate bonds as a central financing instrument

At year-end 2019, the financial debt of €4,518 million comprised
six bonds with a total carrying amount of €3,637 million, lease
liabilities totaling €650 million, bank loans totaling €150 million,
and other financial liabilities of €81 million. On the reporting
date, €3.15 billion of the debt issuance program of up to 5 billion
had been used to issue bonds.

Around 95 percent of the Evonik Group’s non-derivative financial
liabilities are denominated in euros (2018: 97 percent). Including
currency derivatives concluded for financing purposes, around
72 percent of financial liabilities are denominated in euros,
13 percent in Singapore dollars (SGD), 12 percent in US dollars,
and 3 percent in other currencies.

Liquidity position remains strong

As of December 31, 2019, Evonik had cash and cash equivalents
amounting to €1,165 million and current securities totaling
€1,203 million. In addition, Evonik has a €1.75 billion revolving
credit facility as a central source of liquidity. This credit facility
was agreed in June 2017. Following the exercise of the second
and final extension option in June 2019, it runs until June 2024. It
was not utilized in 2019 and does not contain any covenants
requiring Evonik to meet specific financial ratios.

In addition, there are various credit lines to meet local
requirements, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. As of Decem-
ber 31, 2019, €408 million of the total amount had not been
drawn.

1 Ratio of plan assets to pension obligations.

Solid funding of pension obligations

Pension provisions account for around half of our total debt (sum
of financial debt and pension provisions). They are non-current
and depend on the discount rate. Compared with year-end 2018,
pension provisions increased by €235 million to €3,967 million.
The increase in the present value of pension obligations resulting
from the lower discount rate was largely offset by the robust per-
formance of plan assets and the divestment of pension provisions
in connection with the sale of the methacrylates business. The
funding of pension obligations’ was 68 percent as of the report-
ing date, and thus still at a solid level in line with the industry
norm.

Considerably lower capital expenditures

Investment projects are aimed at utilizing potential for sustained
profitable growth and value creation. In the specialty chemicals
sector, Evonik is therefore expanding in business areas and mar-
kets where it already has—or intends to build—a strong compet-
itive position. Every project is required to undergo detailed eco-
nomic and strategic analyses. Evonik expects all projects to meet
a minimum return requirement, which is the cost of capital. We
take a flexible and disciplined approach to extending our leading
market positions. All projects are regularly reviewed for changes
in the market situation.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

We reduced capital expenditures! by 13 percent to €842 million
in 2019 in response to the weaker economic environment. There
is a slight timing difference in outflows for property, plant and
equipment as a result of payment terms. In the reporting period,
outflows for capital expenditures totaled €880 million (2018:
€948 million).

The highest proportion of capital expenditures went to the
Resource Efficiency and Nutrition & Care growth segments
(44 percent and 31 percent respectively). A further 18 percent
was allocated to the Services segment and the Performance
Materials segment received 6 percent. The regional focus of
capital expenditures was Western Europe, which accounted for
65 percent of the total, followed by North America (16 percent),
and Asia-Pacific South and Asia-Pacific North (8 percent each).

2.10 Asset structure

Increase in total assets
As of December 31, 2019, total assets were €1.7 billion higher at
€22.0 billion. Non-current assets increased by €0.7 billion to
€15.4 billion. The disposal of the non-current assets of the
methacrylates business was more than offset by the recognition of
right-of-use assets resulting from the initial application of IFRS 16,
and the increase in financial assets. In all, non-current assets
made up 70 percent of total assets (2018: 72 percent). They are
financed by liabilities with the same maturity structure.

Current assets increased by €1.0 billion to €6.6 billion. The
main reason for this was the receipt of the proceeds from the

divestment of the methacrylates business, which led to a rise in
other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents. At the same
time, there was a reduction in inventories and trade accounts
receivable, which was also due to the divestment of the meth-
acrylates business. Current assets therefore increased slightly to
30 percent of total assets (2018: 28 percent).

Equity? rose by €1.2 billion, to €9.1 billion. The equity ratio
increased from 39 percent to 41 percent. Non-current liabilities
increased slightly to €9.4 billion. The main reason for this was
the initial recognition of lease liabilities due to the first-time

45 percent to 43 percent of total equity and liabilities.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

Evonik Industries AG, Essen (Germany), is the parent company of
the Evonik Group. It holds direct and indirect stakes in all subsid-
iaries in the Evonik Group. The annual financial statements for
Evonik Industries AG have been prepared in accordance with the
accounting standards set out in the German Commercial Code
(HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

The earnings performance of Evonik Industries AG is essen-
tially dependent on income from its subsidiaries, income and
expenses relating to corporate financing, and portfolio manage-
ment activities. Financial management is therefore based on an
earnings indicator that contains all these effects: net income.

The 34 percent reduction in sales to €467 million was principally
attributable to a change in invoicing processes for the procurement
of raw materials. Evonik Industries AG now acts as a procurement
intermediary, and the raw material purchases are made directly
by the Group companies. Consequently, the cost of materials
dropped 78 percent to €58 million. Personnel expense was
€359 million, a decrease of 13 percent compared with the
prior-year figure, which contained expenses for the establishment
of provisions in connection with the SG&A program to reduce
administrative and selling expenses. Other operating income
increased to €611 million, mainly due to income of €104 million

the gross presentation, currency translation gains of €454 million
(2018: €420 million) are shown in other operating income, while
the corresponding currency translation losses of €442 million
(2018: €419 million) are shown separately in other operating
expense. The net effect was a gain of €12 million (2018: €1 million).
Income from investments rose 161 percent to €1,474 million.
This increase was due to higher income from profit-and-loss
transfer agreements, which was in turn mainly due to the divest-
ment of the methacrylates business. The write-downs of financial
assets and current securities totaling €6 million related to other
securities. Write-ups of financial assets and current securities

The net interest position improved considerably year on year
from —€136 million to €28 million. This was mainly due to
income in connection with the valuation of pension assets and
income from the reversal of provisions for interest. In the previous
year, by contrast, the valuation of pension assets resulted in inter-
est expense. Net interest also contains interest income and
expense from the group-wide cash pool, which is concentrated
at Evonik Industries AG.

Income before income taxes increased to €1,227 million,
principally as a result of high income from profit-and-loss transfer
agreements and higher interest income. Income tax expense was
€245 million, compared with €121 million in 2018.

The net income of Evonik Industries AG, calculated on the basis
of the German Commercial Code, was €982 million, which was
€1,045 million higher than in 2018.

After allocating €32 million to retained earnings, the distrib-
utable profit is €950,000,000. A proposal will be put to the
annual shareholders’ meeting that €535,900,000 of the net profit
should be paid out, giving a dividend of €1.15 per share. Further,
€414,100,000 should be carried forward to 2020.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

The total assets of Evonik Industries AG increased from €13.6 billion
in the previous year to €14.0 billion. Financial assets mainly com-
prise shares in subsidiaries. The receivables mainly comprise
financial receivables of €3.1 billion (2018: €3.6 billion), principally
in connection with loans and cash pooling activities. Securities
comprise units totaling €1.2 billion in two specialized funds,
which were acquired in 2019.

Balance sheet for Evonik Industries AG

Equity increased by €0.4 billion to €6.4 billion, mainly as a
consequence of the high net income. The equity ratio increased
from 44.0 percent in 2018 to 45.7 percent. The receivables and
liabilities reflect the group-wide financing activities of Evonik
Industries AG in its role as the holding company for the Group.
Payables include financial liabilities of €6.8 billion (2018:
€6.6 billion). €4.9 billion (2018: €4.8 billion) of this amount are

relates to corporate bonds.

Opportunities and risks

The most significant operating subsidiaries in Germany have
profit-and-loss transfer agreements with Evonik Industries AG. In
line with the central financing strategy of the Evonik Group, most
internal and external financing transactions are handled by
Evonik Industries AG. Consequently, Evonik Industries AG is
essentially exposed to the same risks and opportunities as the
Evonik Group. Further information can be found in the opportu-
nity and risk report ) p.s3¢f.

Outlook’ for 2020

We anticipate that there will be a significant drop in the earnings
of Evonik Industries AG in 2020 compared with the high level
reported for 2019. In particular, income from investments will be
lower than the prior-year figure, which was dominated by the
divestment of the methacrylates business. In addition, there will
be further intragroup mergers of subsidiaries in 2020 as we
optimize our legal structures. The resulting losses from intragroup
mergers will also reduce income from investments. Further, we
assume that income from the valuation of pension assets will be
below the high level reported in 2019.

Report on relations with affiliated companies

A report on Evonik Industries AG's relations with affiliated com-

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

Our vision for Evonik: leading in innovation

The link between innovative power and proximity to customers
is a key success factor for Evonik and drives profitable growth.
Within the growth engines of relevance for Evonik—Specialty
Additives, Animal Nutrition, Health & Care, and Smart Materials—
we identify future-oriented innovation growth fields in highly
attractive markets with above-average growth rates, which
we use to achieve our ambitious targets. Our vision is to be an
innovation leader.

We work with customers and external partners across busi-
ness boundaries and provide incentives for new discoveries so
that good ideas can be turned into marketable innovations.
Through strategic investment, we aim to commercialize the find-
ings of these growth fields faster and more profitably.

Research and development (R&D) in our strategic innovation unit,

Creavis, and in our growth segments is aligned to six innovation

growth fields:

+ Sustainable Nutrition: establishing additional products and
services for sustainable nutrition of livestock and people

+ Healthcare Solutions: developing new materials for implants,
as components of cell culture media, and for custom-tailored,
innovative drug formulations

+ Advanced Food Ingredients: creating a portfolio of
health-enhancing substances and nutritional supplements as a
contribution to healthy nutrition

* Membranes: extending SEPURAN® technology for efficient
gas separation to further applications

+ Cosmetic Solutions: developing further products based
on natural sources for cosmetics and sensorially optimized
formulations for skincare products

+ Additive Manufacturing: developing products and technolo-
gies for additive manufacturing

Through these innovation growth fields, we aim to achieve
additional sales of more than €1 billion by 2025.

We made considerable progress in the Additive Manufacturing
innovation growth field in 2019. Our goal here is to position
Evonik as a solution provider for ready-to-use high-performance
materials. Using the technology we acquired in January 2019
from Structured Polymers Inc., Austin (Texas, USA) for the
production of specialty polymer powders, we have launched a
novel copolyester elastomer powder. The new material is both
tough and flexible and complements our range of products for
powder-based 3D printing technologies.

Through our venture capital unit, we also invested in an
Israeli software start-up that supports industrial companies in the
introduction of 3D printing. The software from Castor Tech-
nologies Ltd., Kfar Hess (Israel) assesses the printability of a
component, the ideal printing material, and calculates production
cost and lead time. That helps producers decide whether and
how to use 3D printing in their production processes. In the
future, this investment will enable Evonik to offer services to
customers so they can test the printability of their components.

Another strategic cooperation in the Additive Manufacturing
growth field is the venture investment in the Chinese start-up
Meditool (Shanghai) Enterprise Co., Shanghai (China), which
manufactures implants for neuro and spine surgery. Meditool
develops its own hardware and software systems, which can
read and process images directly from commonly used magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography scan (CT)
devices. A readily printable 3D model is generated by the soft-
ware and sent to the printer. The implants are 3D printed with
polyetherether ketone (PEEK), a high-performance polymer
supplied by Evonik.

1 Product sales are defined as patent-driven if there is at least one relevant patent in force worldwide.

Successful innovation management
Evonik has an extensive patent strategy to protect new products
and processes. The value and quality of our patent portfolio has
increased steadily in recent years. In 2019, we submitted around
225 new patent applications. Patent-driven sales’ accounted for
around 47 percent of the company’s total sales. In 2019, products
and applications introduced in the past five years accounted for
13 percent of Evonik’s consolidated sales. R&D expenses
declined by 2 percent to €428 million in 2019 as a result of our
continuous, target-oriented management.

Our R&D projects are managed using the multi-step Idea-to-
Profit process developed by Evonik to support the systematic
development of projects right up to profitable commercialization.

Our innovation pipeline comprises completely new business
options as well as activities to secure and enhance the prospects
of existing business operations. Alongside our product and process
innovations, the focus includes innovative business models and
system innovations. Our project portfolio is aligned to the differing
strategies of the various business lines, and we focus on growth
areas with high sustainability benefits.

Targeted research and development

Around 85 percent of our R&D is performed by our manufactur-
ing chemical segments. That includes, first and foremost,
research geared specifically to their core technologies and mar-
kets and to the development of new business. An above-average
proportion of our R&D funding is allocated to our growth seg-
ments, Nutrition & Care and Resource Efficiency. The Perfor-
mance Materials segment focuses on optimizing products and
processes.

Creavis concentrates on mid- and long-term projects that sup-
port Evonik’s growth and sustainability strategy and provide
access to new business options. In addition, it identifies
future-oriented topics and acts as an internal incubator for
Evonik. Using scenario methods, Evonik scientists have devel-
oped future visions for specialty chemicals. This is the world’s
biggest study of this type into the future of specialty chemicals,
and Evonik intends to use the results to initiate timely and pur-
poseful innovations. In addition, long-term strategies can be
measured against the scenarios and refined. Work on innovation

projects of a cross-organizational nature is organized in project
houses. Experts from the organizational units involved in the
project house normally work together for three years on the
project house’s development topics.

Tissue Engineering, our twelfth project house, which was
established at the R&D hub in Singapore in 2018, is working on
new solutions to grow living cells. Its work supports the Health-
care Solutions innovation growth field. The aim is to produce
materials for biological implants for medical applications.
Research is currently being carried out into optimized approaches
to skin models with better predictive power and scalability, plus
excellent reproducibility for the Cosmetic Solutions innovation
growth field. These approaches will be used in laboratory
research and testing, for example, to test active ingredients for
cosmetics, cleaning agents, and chemicals.

Evonik and Siemens have launched Rheticus Il, a joint research
project that aims to develop an efficient and powerful test facility
to produce specialty chemicals with the aid of bacteria—using
carbon dioxide (CO2), water, and electricity from renewable
sources. In the Rheticus | project, the two companies previously
worked for two years to develop the technically feasible basis
for this artificial photosynthesis process using a bioreactor and
electrolyzer. Evonik and Siemens are now combining these two
previously separate plants in a test facility at Evonik’s site in Marl
(Germany).

Evonik also obtains access to innovative technologies and new
business options through its corporate venture capital activities.
In 2019, Evonik set up a second venture capital fund. It has
allocated €150 million to this fund, more than doubling the total
volume to €250 million. We invest specifically in specialized
technology funds and start-ups of strategic relevance to Evonik.

Main table of contents

In this way, we gain insights into innovative developments at a
very early stage. More than 30 investments have been made
since 2012. In addition to investments to strengthen the Additive
Manufacturing innovation growth field, Evonik invested, among
other things, in Modern Meadow (New Jersey, USA). Modern
Meadow’s pioneering technology produces animal-free collagen,
a protein normally found in animal hides, via a fermentation pro-
cess using yeast cells. The biofabricated material produced by this
animal-free method more closely resembles natural leather than
synthetic equivalents because it contains collagen, the main
structural component in cow hides.

A culture of innovation is a key factor in a company’s innovative
capability. Alongside commitment, passion, and stamina, that
entails the strength to halt R&D projects if their prospects of
success are too low, as well as a constructive attitude to mistakes.
We therefore regard Evonik as an open, learning company.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

Responsible corporate management

Evonik’s aim is to be a best-in-class specialty chemicals company.
Our Sustainability Strategy 2020+ is an expression of this aspira-
tion. More and more customers expect us to support them in the
development of resource-saving applications and help them
achieve their sustainability goals. That goes hand in hand with
our responsibility for our employees, the environment, and
society.

Extensive voluntary commitments and undertakings
Evonik is committed to observing internationally recognized
standards, for example, the ten principles of the UN Global
Compact, as well as its own more far-reaching guidelines and
principles of conduct. We are also involved in many networks
such as Chemie, the sustainability initiative of the German
chemical industry, and the World Business Council for Sustain-
able Development (WBCSD). Together with our code of con-
duct, our global social policy, our environment, safety, health and
quality (ESHQ) values and the executive board's policy statement
on human rights provide a framework for responsible corporate
management.

Implementing our Sustainability Strategy 2020+

In February 2019, the executive board adopted our new Sustain-
ability Strategy 2020+, which we are now shaping and putting
into practice. Key elements are integrating sustainability into
strategic management processes, carbon pricing for all invest-
ments, ambitious targets for the reduction of CO, emissions, and
the introduction of global water management.

Transparency and measurability are important
Extensive transparency and soundly based analytical methods are
our response to the growing interest shown by key stakeholders

in our sustainability activities. The objective of our sustainability
analysis 2.0 is to make visible the business success of products
and solutions that contribute to sustainable development. This
externally validated methodology, which was developed in the
previous year, was used for the first time in 2019.

Moreover, as an industrial company, it is important for Evonik
to intensively monitor the impact of its own business activities.
We use an impact valuation to regularly measure and analyze
the direct and indirect impact of our business activities from an
economic, ecological, and social perspective. This highlights the
value we create for society.

Intensive dialogue with stakeholders

Dialogue with our stakeholders is important to give us a better
understanding of different perspectives and regularly review our
own positions. Findings and impetus from our stakeholder dia-
logues facilitate the timely identification of upcoming trends and
market developments. That enables us to customize our products
and solutions to meet the needs of our customers and markets.

We use a variety of formats for dialogue with our stake-
holders. In 2019, they included, for example, an exchange
of experience on the fascination of innovation with selected
representatives of science, business, and non-governmental
organizations. The motto of the Evonik Perspectives stakeholder
forum, which was attended by around 150 stakeholders, was
“Making the future go round—The circular economy as an
opportunity for Germany as a business center.”

We also use feedback from these events to validate our mate-
riality analysis and confirm and, where relevant, fine-tune the
relevance of issues. These regular reviews are used to continuously
improve and develop our stakeholder engagement. The three
topics with the highest priority, according to all stakeholder
groups, are sustainable products/solutions for our customers,

climate change, and efficient handling of scarce resources /circular
economy. We therefore intend to step up our focus on these
topics in the future.

5.1 Employees

Employees are the foundations of our success
People are at the heart of the workplace at Evonik. Our employees
are the basis of our success. Their professional qualifications and
commitment are their key attributes and make Evonik strong.
Evonik aspires to be a best-in-class specialty chemicals
company. To achieve that, we are continuously developing as an
employer because we can only achieve our goal with first-class,
skilled, motivated, and healthy employees.

Global management

As part of our annual strategy process, we ensure continuous
development of our human resources activities in line with our
materiality analysis and human resources strategy. Our HR
strategy comprises the areas attract, develop, perform, retain,
and lead. We use a global system of HR performance indicators
to measure our success.

The HR Executive Committee is the highest decision-making
body for HR. It adopts the global HR strategy and takes decisions
on the group-wide HR organization. This committee comprises
Evonik’s chief human resources officer, the industrial relations
directors of the segments, and the heads of Corporate Talent
Management and Corporate Business Management. Development
of corporate executives is allocated directly to the chairman of
the executive board.
44

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

Systematic talent management

Clear processes, systematic job rotation, and high-quality devel-
opment programs are essential to develop tomorrow's top exec
utives. Potential is assessed, and succession scenarios and devel-
opment requirements for talents at Evonik are regularly discussed
at HR meetings attended by the executive board. A differentiated
development landscape gives equal priority to management
requirements, leadership issues, and personal expectations. Men-
toring programs and initiatives geared to specific topics round out
the offering.

We expect executives to set an example by living our corpo-
rate values—performance, trust, openness, and speed—and to
drive forward the development of our corporate culture. For this
target group, we have established a learning journey to digital
and start-up companies in Germany and the USA.

Appeal as an employer

The key demands made on modern HR work include gaining and
developing the most talented staff. It is therefore important for us
to ensure an attractive working environment, and offer additional
benefits and incentives to supplement our fair, performance-
oriented remuneration. We place special emphasis on work-life
balance.

Successful employer branding

Our global employer branding campaign, #HumanChemistry,
places our employees in the spotlight and makes them the most
important advocates of our company. Personal insights into real
working life at Evonik can be viewed on our careers site at
#HumanChemistry. The success of our employer brand is
measured by our position in external employer rankings and by

1 Termination of employment by new hires in the first year of employment.
2 Including employees of the methacrylates business, which was divested in July 2019.

internal employee surveys. Another indicator used to measure
our attractiveness as an employer is early employee turnover.
In our fifth group-wide employee survey in November 2018,
around 35,000 employees? were asked to give an anonymous
assessment of their working environment. A new survey tool
enables our executives to track the development of opinion after
our employee survey. It is used to monitor the success of the
action taken and the perception of the priority topics. In 2019, we
conducted more than 25 surveys on specific issues. The topics
ranged from monitoring of the new performance management
system introduced in 2019 to user experience of our IT applica-
tions. That all contributes to a lively feedback culture at Evonik.

New performance management system

At the start of 2019, Evonik introduced a new global perfor-
mance management system. The focus is on continuous dialogue,
encouraging performance, and systematically reducing bureau-
cracy. From 2020, the field force will also be using the system.
We hope that this will make our HR processes even leaner.

Long-term jobs

Our aim is to offer our employees an attractive contractual status
to provide security for their long-term planning. Therefore, over
95 percent of our employees worldwide have permanent
contracts. We work with staffing agencies in Germany to cover
short-term or temporary bottlenecks. All agencies must provide
evidence of a valid operating permit. Since the chemical industry
requires a large number of highly qualified employees, fewer
agency staff are used than in other sectors of manufacturing
industry. Agency staff only accounted for a low proportion of
Evonik’s total workforce as of December 31, 2019.

For the second time in succession, our company received the
“Leading Employer” award in Germany and was ranked as the
best employer in the chemical sector. In China, Evonik was once
again ranked among the most popular employers in 2019 (Top
Employer Institute).

Employee survey 2018
Our employee survey in November 2018 covered topics such
as our company, team and collaboration, and innovation and
customer focus. The participation rate was very high at 85 per-
cent. Following a detailed analysis of the results, we have derived
more than 2,000 measures and held numerous workshops
around the world to communicate the results.

Low turnover of newly hired employees within the past three
years compared with other companies indicates a good level of
identification and high employee satisfaction.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

Global remuneration policies

Fair, market- and performance-oriented remuneration is
anchored in our human resources tools worldwide. The princi-
ples used to structure remuneration, including fringe benefits,
are set out in group-wide policies. Remuneration is set on the
basis of objective criteria such as responsibility, competencies,
and success. Personal attributes such as gender, age, etc. play no
part in the process.

Collective agreements on remuneration cover almost
100 percent of our employees in Germany and around 70 percent
of our employees worldwide. Around 97 percent of our sites and
regions have performance- or profit-oriented incentive systems.

Evonik does not restrict employees’ rights to freedom of
association or the right to collective bargaining. These rights are
also ensured in countries where freedom of association is not
protected by the state. Evonik offers voluntary social benefits to
employees in all regions where it has a presence.

In addition, in 2019 we once again offered employees in Ger-
many, the USA, China, Belgium, and Singapore the opportunity
to take part in the “Share” employee share program. The partici-
pation rate remained high at 37 percent in 2019.

Work-life balance

Evonik places value on an HR policy that is family-friendly and
geared to different phases in people’s lives. At the heart of this
approach are flexible worktime models, support for people caring
for close relatives, and assistance with childcare. In 2019, we
were recertified following a berufundfamilie audit (“workand-
family audit”) by the Hertie Foundation. We have many offers to
foster the physical and mental fitness of our employees. In 2019,
the staff restaurants at all our German sites extended our nutrition
concept, which aims to raise awareness of healthy eating. World-
wide, many of our sites also offer a variety of sports activities.

Diversity and equal opportunity

We are an international company and see diversity as an oppor-
tunity. In our view, diversity is not simply a social or political obli-
gation. We see it as a key to the success of our business.

Diversity enriches

Evonik does business in many markets worldwide. Diversity is
therefore normal in our business activities. Employees with dif-
ferent backgrounds and personalities enrich our teams and our
company. They enhance our creativity, innovative capability, and
proximity to customers.

Our diversity council ensures that diversity is a success factor
that is deeply embedded in our organization and drives it forward
through cross-business criteria. The council includes members of
the executive board, the heads of the segments and regions, and
executives from various organizational units. Fostering diversity
goes well beyond this group of individuals and is a central
demand made on all management functions at Evonik.

Our code of conduct and global social policy forbid discrimi-
nation on the basis of origin, race, religion, age, gender, sexual
orientation, and disability. Employees who feel they have been
discriminated against have a right to lodge a complaint. Contacts
for this are available at all sites.

Age structure

In 2019, the average age of Evonik employees was 42 years. Lon-
ger working lives and altered job requirements are starting to
change the world of work. In line with this, we foster and stretch
our employees in all phases of their working lives, for example,
through our well@work initiative and the Learning and Individu-
alized Library (LILY) online platform for lifelong learning.

Increasing the proportion of women in our company worldwide
and at all levels is one of Evonik’s declared objectives. At present,
26 percent of our employees are female.

The proportion of female managers was unchanged at

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

An extensive range of measures supports the attainment of these
targets. These include development activities, networking
events, mentoring, and support programs. Examples are special
offerings to increase the compatibility of work and family life and
a new job-sharing platform. The offer is graduated, making it
available to women at all management levels.

As a global company, it is particularly important to us to ensure
that our workforce includes a broad spectrum of different nation-
alities. Evonik currently employs people of 101 different nation-
alities at 195 sites in more than 50 countries. Around 43 percent
of employees in management functions come from countries
other than Germany. Group-wide, the proportion in middle
management is around 27 percent.

Training and continuing professional

development

Well-trained employees are a clear competitive advantage. Our
learning strategies and personnel development programs focus
on our corporate targets and future business needs.

Learning strategy for continuing professional
development
Our training and continuing professional development activities
comprise further training of our employees as well as vocational
training of young people. Evonik’s learning strategy was devel-
oped in consultation with employees. It comprises two offerings:
the global development portal (GDP) as a central platform for all
learning needs and the Learning and Individualized Library
(LILY), which provides constant access to learning resources.
The GDP is available to all employees worldwide. The aim is
to ensure full transparency about learning offerings, contacts,
and costs. In addition, our online offerings reflect the progress of
digitalization. LILY provides structured learning journeys that
help our employees deal with the demands made by the faster
pace of work and changing demands in the workplace.

1 The maximum that can be achieved is 6.0.

Training ratio remains high
To secure the need for skilled workers, especially in production
and related areas, back in 2016, Evonik started to train apprentices
based on requirements. On this basis, following the summer
examinations in 2019, we were able to offer jobs to those
apprentices who were able and willing to take up employment.
In 2019, Evonik trained around 1,600 young people, including
more than 400 on behalf of other companies. Our training
covered more than 32 recognized vocational training courses and
combined vocational training and study programs at 15 sites.
Apprentices accounted for around 6.8 percent of our work-
force in Germany, which is still well above the national average
of around 5 percent. In all, we invested €60 million in vocational
training of employees. Our high commitment to vocational training
is reflected in exam results.

In 2019, 90 places for young people who were not ready for an
apprenticeship were taken up on the “Start in den Beruf” pre-
apprenticeship program. That figure includes the 20/20/20
training initiative of the Evonik Foundation, which financed
40 places, including 20 for young refugees.

In the reporting period, Evonik invested around €500 per
employee in training and continuing professional development.
That was a total of €16 million.

Health protection and promotion

Global management of health protection and promotion at
Evonik takes a long-term, holistic approach, covering employees,
the working situation, and the general working environment.

Healthy employees are our goal

Our approach includes high-quality medical care as required,
applying ergonomic and health-related measures to structure
working conditions, and a functioning emergency management
system at plant level. In addition, we offer a selective range of

COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Main table of contents

health promotion measures, which are bundled in the group-
wide well@work initiative. In this way, we help our employees
adopt a healthy lifestyle.

The main goals and aspects of our occupational health strat-
egy are outlined in the Evonik Global Health Program. On this
basis, we systematically refine our strategy and adapt it to the
latest developments.

Based on occupational health and safety requirements in
Germany, we have set out policies for our global workforce. The
occupational safety committees at our sites in Germany meet at
least four times a year. There are also comparable bodies at sites
outside Germany.

Fulfillment of the relevant requirements is checked regularly
by corporate audits and regional environment, safety, and health
audits, as well as through an extensive occupational health and
safety reporting system. Action is taken if there are indications
that there is scope for improvement or deviations from the
applicable guidelines. Where necessary, improvements are
suggested or required.

Achieving our health protection goals is measured by our
Occupational Health Performance Index, which comprises
parameters from the areas of occupational medicine, health
promotion, and emergency medical management. In 2016, we
defined a long-term target of > 5.01. According to the reports
submitted by our organizational units, we achieved this.

As part of its preventive health promotion activities, Evonik
uses suitable measures to prevent occupational illnesses and
work-related health impairments. In this context, Evonik regularly
reports on occupational illnesses.
47

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

Corporate health promotion

Our well@work program focuses on three aspects: exercise, a
healthy diet, and work-life balance. Corporate health promotion
has a firm place in this: Evonik uses basic programs with a long-
term focus to encourage employees to adopt a healthy lifestyle.
These are supplemented by special topics, which change every
year. At all of our German sites there are interdisciplinary health
task forces to implement well@work.

Headcount hardly changed

The Evonik Group had 32,423 employees at year-end 2019. That
was 3,620 fewer than at year-end 2018, principally as a result of
the divestment of the methacrylates business, which is reported
as a discontinued operation. The headcount in the continuing
operations dropped by 200, mainly due to the implementation of
the program to optimize administrative functions and some
smaller optimization efforts in our chemical segments.

5.2 Safety

Safety as a management task

Our Safety at Evonik safety culture initiative has been developed
into a group-wide management approach for all aspects of occu-
pational and transportation safety. It defines binding principles of
action that give managers and employees reliable guidance on
safety-compliant conduct.

To meet its management responsibility in occupational and
plant safety, Evonik has globally valid policies and operating pro-
cedures that are firmly anchored in an integrated management
system. Observance of these rules is monitored via a central audit
system. Business-specific implementation is defined by the seg-
ments. Steering bodies at Group level ensure that mission-critical
processes are standardized across the segments. Implementation
of these requirements and any additional action required are
tracked through group-wide targets based on key performance
indicators. Accident frequency and severity are also included in
the variable remuneration of the executive board.

Our crisis and incident management focuses on preventing
and limiting damage if accidents nevertheless happen. To build
and share the necessary experience, we are actively involved in
various national and international networks. We analyze inci-
dents carefully, so we can learn from them and further improve
our safety performance. Our global newsletter “Learning from
one another” provides information on incidents and topical safety
issues.

Safety

Our overriding aim is to avoid all accidents and incidents. We set
annual limits for occupational safety and plant safety indicators.

For 2020 these are unchanged:
+ Accident frequency should not exceed 1.30.
+ The incident frequency rate should not exceed 1.10.

Accident frequency indicator below the upper limit
We pay special attention to occupational safety. Employee safety
covers safety on the way to and from work as well as safety at
work. Contractors’ employees working at our sites are also
included.

Accident frequency’ is the performance indicator for occu-
pational safety at Evonik. In 2019, the accident frequency rate for
Evonik employees? was within our defined maximum limit of
1.30. However, it was 1.18, which was above the previous year’s
very good level (0.87). In 2019, most accidents occurred in the
service units, especially in the area of logistics. Specific action
will be taken in 2020 at the sites that were most affected.

There were no fatal accidents at work involving our employees
or contractors’ employees at our sites in the reporting period.
However, there was one fatal traffic accident involving an
employee traveling to work in Belgium. The accident frequency
rate for contractors’ employees! was 3.03, slightly above the
previous year’s very good rate of 2.77. The catering area was
responsible for the increase in accident frequency, however only
minor injuries were involved

Incident frequency indicator at a very good level

Safety is part of our DNA: It is the basic precondition for the
operation and performance of our facilities. Incident frequency”
is used to measure the safety of our plants. Incident frequency
was 1.10, so we once again achieved our goal of remaining below
or at most at the upper limit of 1.10. The development of
the incident frequency indicator in recent years shows that the
measures introduced are having a long-term effect.

Our goal is to constantly improve our safety performance. We
have therefore introduced a new key performance indicator?
(KPI) to measure energy and product leakages below the present

thresholds. This new KPI also measures the number of incidents
per 200,000 working hours in our production facilities, compared
with per 1 million working hours in the past. In this way, we can
make safety management even more efficient and more effective.
We expect more detailed data collection and evaluation to
deepen our understanding of the potential for improvement. At
the same time, it means Evonik has adopted the recommendations
of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA).

5.3 The environment

Protecting our environment and the climate are major global
challenges of our age. Maintaining the natural basis of life for
future generations is part of our corporate responsibility. That
includes continuously reducing emissions in keeping with our
sustainability strategy. As a specialty chemicals company, we are
aware that our production may possibly impact the environment.
We take many steps to minimize this.

Worldwide management

Our actions are based on an extensive, integrated management
system for the environment, safety, health, and quality. This
applies to the whole of the Evonik Group and is based on legal
requirements, internal policies, and standard operating procedures.
In addition to meeting compliance requirements, we therefore
support the continuous improvement of our environmental
performance. In addition, we require our manufacturing sites to
be validated as conforming to ISO 14001, the internationally
recognized environmental management standard. The proportion
of output covered by validation varies because of the addition of
new units. However, it is always between 95 and 100 percent.

Implementation of our strategy and management system is mon-
itored via a central audit system. The executive board is informed
annually of the outcome of the audits. The processes used to col-
lect and process environmental data are subject to internal and
external audits. Our high quality standards are backed up by reg-
ular training. Our global ESHQ (environment, safety, health, and
quality) strategy is defined by the HR Executive Committee.

Climate change

According to our materiality analysis, climate change is one of the
three most important sustainability issues. As well as producing
products that are more sustainable and enhance efficiency for our
customers, we are reducing our CO, emissions by modernizing
and renewing our energy infrastructure. In 2019, we introduced
carbon pricing as an additional investment criterion.

Responsibility at the highest level

Climate change is a matter of the utmost importance for the
entire executive board. Direct responsibility for our group-wide
sustainability and climate strategy, monitoring, and reporting is
assigned to the member of the executive board responsible for
human resources, sustainability, amd ESHQ. The head of Corporate
ESHQ reports regularly to the executive board on climate-related
issues. These include environmental indicators, including climate-
related performance indicators, as well as targets and target
attainment. In addition, the responsible member of the executive
board and the heads of Corporate ESHQ and Corporate Sustain-
ability are members of the HR Executive Committee, which
defines the strategic approach to climate-related issues. The
other members of this committee are representatives of the
segments, corporate functions, and regions, and technical
experts. The executive board discusses relevant issues relating to
sustainability, the environment, safety, health, and quality, and

the status and progress of the various programs with the heads of
the segments and corporate functions on a quarterly basis.

Our previous environmental targets

For the period 2013-2020, we set ambitious environmental
objectives for Evonik based in each case on one metric ton of
output (reference base: 2012):

+ Reduce specific greenhouse gas emissions’ by 12 percent

+ Reduce specific water intake? by 10 percent

A further reduction in production waste was set as an additional
target.

? Compared with the reference year (2012).
> Includes both scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. Scope 2 emissions are calculated using
the market-based method in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

The divestment of the methacrylates business in July 2019 had
a major influence on the development of our environmental
indicators in 2019. Overall, this affected 14 production sites.
Since separate management of the methacrylates business was no
longer undertaken in 2019, the presentation of the environmental
data and the status of environmental targets in the reporting
period only covers the continuing operations. As a result, the
specific data for 2019 are no longer comparable with the data for
2018 because the differences in the product portfolio, production
volumes, and environmental impact are too significant. For

example, the methacrylates business mainly used cooling circuits
rather than once-through cooling systems. Consequently, the
divestment of this business had relatively little impact on water
intake in 2019. By contrast, it resulted in a sharp reduction in
production output of 17 percent. That was the main reason for
the 1 percentage point increase in specific water intake in 2019.

New environmental targets for climate protection
Since we achieved our target for the reduction in specific green-
house gas emissions ahead of schedule, the executive board
adopted new environmental targets in February 2019. Our target
of a 50 percent reduction in absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions? by
2025 compared with the level in 2008—the first full year after
the establishment of Evonik—affirms our commitment to the
Paris Agreement on Climate Change. At present, we assume an
average reduction in climate-relevant emissions of 3 percent a
year. The relatively short period up to 2025 reflects our view that
it is not currently possible to predict technological and regulatory
developments beyond this date with sufficient certainty. In addi-
tion to this, we intend to improve upstream scope 3 emissions by
3 percent a year.

The use of of alternative technologies and efficient production
processes will help us achieve our targets. We use a broad spec-
trum of technical and organizational measures to raise energy effi-
ciency. Examples are co-generation plants and the expansion of
integrated structures linking chemical production and energy
generation. Third-party production facilities are included in these
measures. We also consider using renewable energies. Many of
our energy management systems meet the high standards of
ISO 50001.

Evonik is planning to build a gas and steam turbine power plant
in Marl (Germany) to replace the last coal-fired power plant at
this site from the end of 2022. This will reduce our CO emissions
by up to 1 million metric tons p.a. At the same time, the new
plant’s modern power and steam generation will be far better
able to meet the constantly fluctuating demand at the chemical
park in Marl (Germany). In addition to the chemical park in Marl,
our other German sites will benefit from the new installations,
because they will ensure economical in-house generation
throughout Germany.

Lower greenhouse gas emissions

Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions fell 13 percent to 4.92 million
metric tons CO, equivalents in 2019, mainly as a result of the
divestment of the methacrylates business. The sum of scope 1
and scope 2 (net, market-based) greenhouse gas emissions
decreased by 17 percent to 5.49 million metric tons CO equiva-
lents for the same reason. Scope 2 emissions are reported on a
net basis by deducting electricity and steam sold to third parties
from the electricity and steam produced for captive use. Scope 1
and 2 greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by 42 percent
compared with the reference base (2008).

The 24 facilities operated by Evonik that fall within the scope
of the European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)
emitted 3.3 million metric tons of CO, in 2019 (2018 including
the methacrylates business: 3.9 million metric tons CO3).

Carbon pricing factored into investment calculations

In February 2019, we introduced country-specific carbon pricing
for all investments as a basis for effective management of our new
COy reduction target. This is unrelated to present or foreseeable

regulatory requirements. It adds another relevant risk assessment
indicator to the existing planning parameters for investments.
The aim is to be able to reflect the expected development of
carbon-intensive investments in a reliable and harmonized manner
in all investment applications worldwide. We assume that, in ten
years at the latest, relevant market prices or regulatory pricing
systems of at least €50 per metric ton CO, will be established in
all regions of relevance to Evonik. In view of regional differences
in the starting situation, we have developed scenarios for the
development of carbon pricing for the next ten years, showing
the rise to the assumed final price.

Information based on TCFD for the first time

We are following the objectives of the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the ongoing develop-
ment of established reporting standards with great interest. In
keeping with its participation in CDP Climate Change, in 2019,
Evonik again issued detailed strategies, data, and development
paths on climate change." For the first time, we have presented
key climate-related information in a TCFD index? using the
TCFD structure, divided into the categories governance, strategy,
risk management, and metrics and targets.

Water management

We save water wherever possible and endeavor to achieve a
further reduction in our emissions into water. A good water
supply remains crucial for smooth production.

Efficient use of water
The Evonik Group strives to use water as efficiently as possible.
Following the introduction of our new water target, our main
focus initially is on sites in regions that are sensitive to water
stress.3

Taking into account projections for the climate and
socio-economic developments, we have identified sites that are
particularly likely to be affected by water stress in the next
20 years. At these sites, we aim to take specific preventive action
by developing site-specific action plans. That includes exploring
alternative cooling systems or transportation options and
options to reduce the use of process water. To reflect the
special significance of freshwater, we take into account surface
water, groundwater, and drinking water.

In our water stress analysis in 2018, we looked at the availability
of water for industrial purposes in the next two decades at 107
sites and identified sites affected by water shortages. We have
conducted detailed local interviews at the sites most affected and
now intend to develop specific action plans.

In place of our previous group-wide target for a reduction in
specific water intake, we are developing site-specific action
plans. Taking into account projections for the climate and
socio-economic developments, we are identifying the sites
which will be most affected by water stress in the next 20 years.
At these sites, we want to take specific precautions: For example,
we are examining alternative cooling systems and transportation
options, and the possibility of reducing the volume of process
water.

5.4 Value chain*

We drive forward our sustainability activities along the value
chain. In addition to our own production and business processes,
we always have an eye on the supply chain for our raw materials,
goods, and services, and on product benefits and applications for
customers.

Preventing bribery and corruption

Evonik is committed to fair competition for the benefit of
customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. All employees
are required to act lawfully in the business environment. We
respect the independence of officials. All forms of corruption,
including “facilitation payments,” are banned at Evonik. We
deliberately set stricter standards than the law in some countries.

Our rules on preventing corruption are set out in our code of
conduct, our master gifts and hospitality policy, and our policy
for the use of external third parties for distribution and dealing
with authorities (policy on external intermediaries).

Our code of conduct is binding for all Evonik employees
worldwide, including the executive board and the governance
bodies of all Evonik companies. They are all required to comply
with the rules set forth in the code of conduct, to ensure they are
familiar with its content, and to take part in the relevant training. °

3 Water stress is a condition that was originally used to describe the impact of water shortages on living organisms such as plants. It is increasingly being used with reference to the availability of water for industrial processes.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

Supply chain

Code of conduct for suppliers

We expect our suppliers to share our principles and to act cor-
rectly in all respects, which means accepting responsibility
towards their employees, business partners, society, and the
environment.

We have therefore issued a special code of conduct for suppliers,
setting out binding requirements for these business partners.
This is based on our corporate values, the principles of the UN
Global Compact, the International Labour Standards issued by
the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the topics
addressed by the Responsible Care® initiative. Intermediaries,
above all sales intermediaries, are subject to a compliance check
before the establishment of the business relationship and every
five years thereafter. They also have to sign a compliance decla-
ration.

By selecting suppliers carefully, we do not simply secure and
increase their sustainability standards; we also enhance the quality
of the entire value chain. On the one hand, we focus on validation
and evaluation of suppliers, and on the other, we specifically
monitor certain raw materials. These include renewable raw
materials and raw materials where there is a potential supply risk
or reputational risk, for example, conflict minerals. We have
implemented strategic procurement concepts for these “critical
raw materials,” whose availability is vital for our production
processes. These processes are integrated into a management
system, where they are mapped.

In the validation and evaluation of our suppliers, we work
systematically both to extend strategic relationships with suppliers
and to validate new suppliers. This covers economic and quality-
related requirements as well as environmental, social, corporate
governance, and human rights aspects.

Procurement! is organized globally at Evonik and comprises
direct procurement (raw materials, logistics, and packaging) and
indirect procurement (general and technical goods and services).
Both are subdivided into strategic and operational procurement
activities. Alongside economic requirements, our procurement
strategy takes account of sustainability aspects such as health,
quality, safety, social factors, and environmental protection.

Supplier assessment

Evonik also drives forward sustainability and transparency in the
supply chain through the sector initiative Together for Sustain-
ability (TfS), where we are one of the six founding members.
The aim of TfS is the joint development and implementation of a
global assessment and audit program for responsible procurement
of goods and services. As a member of the initiative, Evonik is
also subject to TfS assessments. Our gold rating positioned us
among the top-rated companies again in 2019.

We have set ourselves the following global goals for our strategic

supplier management:

+ 100 percent of all raw materials suppliers where annual
procurement volume is >€100 thousand to be covered by TfS
assessments by year-end 2025.

+ Conduct at least 20 supplier sustainability audits p.a. under
the shared audit principle of the TfS initiative.

+ By 2020: Evaluate the sustainability performance of 90 percent
of suppliers of critical raw materials?.

In 2019, we conducted 26 sustainability audits and therefore met
our target. In addition, the percentage of suppliers of critical raw
materials evaluated was over 92 percent, so we are on track to
meet the target for 2020.

1 For information on our current procurement activities, see section 2.4 Business conditions and performance la} p.20ff.

As a responsible company, Evonik meets its duty of care with
regard to conflict minerals? in the supply chain and checks the
origin of such substances delivered by its suppliers. Our screening
in 2019 did not identify any use of conflict minerals.

Product stewardship

Through our products and solutions, we aim to make a measurable
contribution to avoiding environmental impact and enhancing
people’s quality of life. This includes timely identification and
evaluation of the potential health and environmental risks in our
portfolio. We examine the entire value chain of each of our
products—from procurement of the raw materials to delivery to
our industrial customers, who receive all relevant information on
the handling and disposal of our products. That includes, for
example, safety data sheets and technical information sheets.
As well as complying with all statutory requirements such as the
European chemicals regulation (REACH) and the Globally
Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals
(GHS), product stewardship at Evonik includes voluntary
commitments that go beyond these regulations.
52

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

We have been committed for many years to the international
Responsible Care® initiative and the Responsible Care® Global
Charter of the International Council of Chemical Associations,
which includes the Global Product Strategy. The key elements of
our product stewardship have been defined in a product policy.
We evaluate all substances placed on the market (> 1 metric ton
p.a.). Particularly dangerous substances are included from lower
amounts. That allows a soundly based assessment of the risks.
Where necessary, restrictions are placed on certain usage patterns
or, in extreme cases, a complete ban is issued on use in certain
products.

We use the Chemicals Management System developed by
Evonik to evaluate our substances. This system supports us in
global product evaluation, analogously to a life cycle analysis. As
an extension of this, our Chemicals Management System"“S js
used for products containing substances of very high concern.
These are subject to a more detailed examination to bring about
a further reduction in the negative impact on people and the
environment.

Respecting human rights

Evonik looks at human rights at all stages in the value chain,
including suppliers, its own processes, and customer applications.
The demands made on our suppliers are set out in a separate
code of conduct. We regularly check compliance through our
supplier validation and evaluation processes.

Information on breaches of our commitments can be
reported via a whistleblower system operated by a third party,
which guarantees the anonymity of the whistleblower. This
enables employees and third parties (for example, local residents,
suppliers, customers) to report suspected breaches of human

rights. The Corporate Responsibility division examines all allega-
tions. No suspected breaches of human rights were reported in
2019.

Our human rights risk map helps us identify and assess potential
human rights and labor law risks. In addition, we have refined
our human rights training programs, which are used in training of
managers and employees in various countries, including Singapore,
Brazil, and the United States. The courses give participants a
basic overview of human rights, present the relevant Evonik
regulations, and show how they relate to the applicable human
rights and labor rights.

The German government's national action plan on business and
human rights (NAP) is an initiative to improve human rights
throughout the value chain. A government survey in 2019 and
2020 is compiling information on implementation of core
elements of the duty to respect human rights in accordance with
the NAP. We took part in this through Evonik Nutrition & Care
GmbH. The government will use the results of this review to
decide on possible legislation.

Social commitment

We produce where our markets and customers are. Conse-
quently, we have production facilities in 26 countries on six
continents. Local residents around our sites play an especially
important part in stakeholder management at Evonik. At all our
sites they have an elementary interest in experiencing Evonik as
a reliable partner and want timely information on the latest
developments at Evonik.

6.1 Opportunity and risk management

Risk strategy

Evonik’s group-wide internal opportunity and risk management
(referred to generically as risk management in this section) forms
a central element in the management of the company. Our risk
management includes a risk detection system, which meets the
requirements for publicly listed companies. The aims are to iden-
tify risks as early as possible and to define measures to counter and
minimize them. To ensure optimal use is made of opportunities,
these also need to be recognized and tracked from an early stage.
We only enter into entrepreneurial risks when we are convinced
that we can generate a sustained rise in the value of the company
and, at the same time, permanently limit possible negative
implications.

Structure and organization of risk management

At Group level, risk management is assigned to the chief financial
officer and is organized on a decentralized basis in line with
Evonik’s organizational structure.

The segments, corporate divisions, and service units bear
prime responsibility for risk management. That comprises early
identification of risks and estimating their implications. Further-
more, suitable preventive and control measures have to be intro-
duced and internal communication of risks must be ensured. Risk
coordinators in the organizational units are responsible for
agreeing on the relevant risk management activities. At all levels
in the Group, systematic and timely risk reporting is a key element

in strategic and operational planning, the preparation of invest-
ment decisions, projections, and other management and decision-
making processes.

A central corporate risk officer coordinates and oversees the
processes and systems. The corporate risk officer is the contact
for all risk coordinators and is responsible for information, docu-
mentation, and coordination at Group level. Further responsibil-
ities include ongoing development of the methodology used by
the risk management system. The risk committee is chaired by
the chief financial officer and composed of representatives of the
corporate divisions. It validates the group-wide risk situation and
verifies that it is adequately reflected in financial reporting. The
supervisory board, especially the audit committee, oversees the
risk management system.

Main table of contents

In 2019, risk management again included all consolidated compa-
nies in the Evonik Group. At companies where we do not exert a
controlling influence, we implement our risk management
requirements primarily through our presence in management and
supervisory bodies.

The internal audit function monitors risk management in our
organizational units to make sure they comply with statutory and
internal requirements and to ensure continuous improvement of
risk management. The risk detection system is included in the
annual audit in compliance with the requirements for listed
companies. This audit showed that Evonik’s risk detection system
is suitable for timely identification of risks that could pose a
threat to the company’s survival.

The risk management system is based on the internationally
recognized COSO Enterprise Management standard. It is imple-
mented through a binding group-wide policy. Individual risks are
systematically identified and managed with the aid of special risk
management software. Their probability of occurrence and the
possible damage (potential impact) are evaluated and documented,
together with their expected value (product of probability
of occurrence and potential impact). Analogously to current
planning, the evaluation is based on a period of three years
(mid-term planning). Opportunities and risks are defined as
positive and negative deviations from the plan. The relevant
indicators include adjusted EBITDA. In addition, longer-term
opportunities and risks, including those relating to sustainability,
are included.
55

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

The organizational units conduct an extensive annual risk inven-
tory in connection with the mid-term planning process. They are
required to provide details of the measures to be taken with
regard to the risks identified, introduce them immediately, and
track their timely implementation. Internal management (for
example, reporting by the risk committee) takes a mid-term
view. The opportunities and risks identified are classified as low,
moderate or high (see opportunity and risk matrix c26). The eval-
uation is always based on a net view, in other words, taking into
account risk limitation measures. Risk limitation measures can
reduce, transfer, or avoid gross risks. Common measures include
economic counteraction, insurance, and the establishment of
provisions on the balance sheet.

The risk inventory is supplemented by quarterly reviews of all
opportunities and risks relating to the present year, both to spot
changes in the opportunities and risks that have already been
identified and to identify new risks and opportunities.

All high and moderate risks and opportunities with an expected
value of over €100 million in the mid term are classified as material
individual risks and opportunities. The expected value is used
exclusively as a basis for prioritization and to focus reporting on
key issues.

6.2 Overall assessment of opportunities
and risks

Given the measures planned and implemented, as of the reporting
date no risks have been identified that—either individually or in
conjunction with other risks—could jeopardize the continued
existence of Evonik as a whole, including Evonik Industries AG in
its role as the holding company for the Group.

Overall assessment of opportunities and risks

Main table of contents

For 2019 we expected more risks than opportunities. During the
year, the opportunities and risks were reduced considerably,
mainly due to the divestment of the methacrylates business.
Overall, more risks than opportunities materialized in our seg-
ments. Our reporting distinguishes between the categories mar-
kets and competition, legal and compliance, and process and
organization. The main parameters influencing the risk categories
in terms of both opportunities realized and risks that materialized
resulted from the development of specific market and competi-
tive situations. From the present standpoint, the risks for 2020
again outweigh the potential opportunities. Compared with
2019, both the opportunities and the risks for the Evonik Group
have decreased, mainly because of the divestment of the meth-
acrylates business.

Material individual risks and opportunities for the Evonik
Group are changes in exchange rates and the overall economic
development. Further material risks relate to margins for C4
chemicals and the increasing threat of cyberattacks. Measures to
reduce the risks include general economic mitigation measures
and, especially with regard to changes in exchange rates, the use
of hedging instruments. Sections 6.3 | p.56ff., 6.4 a) p.60ff., and
6.5 D) p.62 present the material individual risks and opportunities,
along with further opportunities and risks in each category.
Except where otherwise indicated, they apply for all segments.

6.3 Market and competition opportunities
and risks

In accordance with our internal management, opportunities and
risks in the market and competition category are allocated to risk
quantification classes within sub-categories. Chart c27 shows the
highest class to which an individual risk or opportunity is allo-
cated in each sub-category. Individual opportunities and risks
may also be allocated to the lower risk classes.

1. Sales markets

The global macroeconomic development entails both opportuni-
ties and risks for Evonik. The drivers of these opportunities and
risks are, in particular, the continued development of trade dis-
putes, the impact of Brexit, and the economic development of
major economies. Developments in key sectors of the economy
can affect demand in the market areas of relevance for Evonik.

Opportunity and risk classes within the market and competition category

Global economic trends influence the development of Evonik’s
earnings and cash flows. We counter these economic risks by
constantly monitoring the macroeconomic environment, optimiz-
ing cost structures and competitive positions in our established
areas of business, setting up production facilities close to our
markets, and extending businesses in our portfolio that have low
cyclical exposure.

Alongside the general demand situation, intensive competi-
tion in the various market segments harbors both opportunities
and risks. These may result from either demand in specific markets
or the competitive situation in various industries. Changes in
demand can have a considerable impact on our business volume
and sales. There are associated opportunities and risks, among
other things, for our amino business and our C, chemicals
business. In our market segments, climate change could also
result in both opportunities and risks for Evonik. There could be
a significant hike in the rising demand from our customers for
products that save resources, resulting in a correspondingly
positive impact on our business. Additional regulations or

weather-related incidents could put pressure on production costs
and, at the same time, lead to rising demand for our resource-
efficient products. To reduce the risks, we monitor the specific
developments very carefully and work closely with our customers
on the development of sustainable solutions.

Competitors in emerging markets and developing countries can
increase competitive pressure through new capacities and
aggressive pricing policies that can impair our selling prices and
volume trends. To counter this, we are broadening our foreign
production base and gaining access to new markets in high-
growth regions such as Asia and South America. To reduce these
risks, the operating units affected also use various methods of
increasing customer loyalty and gaining new customers, enter
into strategic research alliances with customers, and extend the
services offered along the value chain.

We are constantly developing attractive and competitive new
products and technologies to mitigate the risk that chemical
products could be replaced by new, improved, or less expensive
materials or technologies. Here, the opportunities and risks also
relate to the sale of licenses. One potential risk factor for our
amino acids business, for example in Asia, is the possible impact
of substandard food quality and food safety. We utilize opportuni-
ties for profitable future growth by gaining access to new markets
as part of our strategic development.

Customer concentration is basically low in our chemical
segments. None of the end-markets that we supply accounts for
more than 20 percent of sales. Nevertheless, some operational
units, especially in the Nutrition & Care, Resource Efficiency, and
Services segments have a certain dependence on key customers.
In the operating business, this applies in particular to production
facilities erected in the direct vicinity of major customers. The
possible loss of a major customer could result in lower sales and
57

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

in impairment losses on receivables and investments, as well as
impacting our long-term raw material agreements or the financial
structure of our affiliates.

2. Financial markets

As a rule, liquidity, credit default, currency, and interest rate
risks, and the risks relating to pension obligations are managed
centrally. All material financial risk positions are identified and
evaluated in accordance with group-wide policies and principles.
This forms the basis for selective hedging to limit risks. In the use
of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to mini-
mize the risks, Evonik applies the principle of separation of front
office, risk controlling, and back office functions and takes as its
guide the banking-specific minimum requirements for risk man-
agement (MaRisk) and the requirements of the German legisla-
tion on corporate control and transparency (KonTraG). Financial
derivatives! are only used in connection with corresponding
hedged items.

Exchange rate volatility

Transaction-related exchange rate risks arise from the translation
of operating monetary assets and liabilities on the balance sheet
into the functional currency of the respective Group company.

The resulting net risk is normally hedged in full using derivatives.
Further, our transaction-related currency management takes
account of forecast cash inflows and outflows, which are hedged
on the basis of forecast transactions, with a target hedging rate of
up to 75 percent. Material opportunities and risks may arise from
the remaining unhedged items and from discrepancies between
the actual future rates from the average rates used to hedge fore-
cast transactions. Scenario analyses are performed to estimate

and control such risks and opportunities. These focus on the main
foreign currencies of relevance for the Evonik Group, the US dol-
lar, Chinese renminbi yuan, and the Singapore dollar. In view of
the rising importance of regions outside the euro zone, risks and
opportunities relating to transactions in foreign currencies will
increase in the long term. In addition, there are currency-related
risks from the translation of separate financial statements.
Increasing volatility of exchange rates can be seen, in particular,
in emerging markets, for instance, in Argentina, which is a hyper-
inflationary economy. Economic risks also arise because
exchange rates influence our competitiveness in global markets.

Changes in interest rates

Potential changes in capital market rates result in opportunities
and risks. These comprise, on the one hand, changes in the fair
value of fixed-interest financial instruments and, on the other,
changes in interest payments on variable-rate financial instru-
ments. To control these risks, when setting interest rate terms
Evonik pays special attention to the structure of the fixed-floating
rate mix? and uses interest rate swaps for further optimization
where appropriate. Through the use of fixed-interest loans and
interest rate hedging instruments, 83 percent of all financial lia-
bilities were classified as fixed-interest as of the reporting date,
and therefore had no material exposure to changes in interest
rates.

Liquidity risks

To manage the Group’s solvency, Evonik uses central liquidity
risk management’. At its heart is a group-wide cash pool. In
addition, Evonik’s financial independence is secured through a
broadly diversified financing structure, a €1.75 billion revolving

Main table of contents

credit facility as a central source of liquidity, and our solid invest-
ment grade rating. Overall, we believe that adequate financing
instruments are available to ensure sufficient liquidity at all times.

Default risks

Default risks involve the risk of a loss if our debtors are fully or
partially unable to meet their payment commitments. The credit
risk of our customers and financial counterparties is therefore
systematically examined when the contracts are concluded and
monitored continuously afterwards. Limits are set for each con-
tractual partner on the basis of internal or rating-based credit-
worthiness analyses.

Financial opportunities and risks in connection with
pension obligations

Both opportunities and risks may arise from potential changes in
the parameters used to evaluate our pension obligations 4.
Changes, especially in interest rates but also in mortality rates
and rates of salary increases, can alter the present value of pen-
sion obligations, which directly alters equity and can result in
changes in the expenses for pension plans.

Market opportunities and risks, and liquidity and default risks
relating to financial instruments, also arise from the management
of our pension plan assets. We counter these risks through an
active risk management approach, combined with detailed risk
controlling. Strategic management of the portfolios takes place
via regular asset/liability studies. To minimize risk, we use deriv-
ative hedging strategies where appropriate. The broad diversifi-
cation of asset classes, portfolio sizes, and asset managers avoids
cluster risks, but there are unavoidable residual risks in the indi-
vidual investments.

3 A detailed overview of liquidity risks and their management can be found in note 9.4 ik] p-148 ff. Details of the financing of the Evonik Group and action to protect liquidity can be found in the section 2.9 Financial condition a p.32ff.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

Impairment risk

The risk of asset impairment arises when the interest rate used in
an impairment test rises, the forecast cash flows decline, or
investment projects are halted. Specific risks may arise in connec-
tion with goodwill or individual assets.

3. Raw material markets

For our business operations, we require both high-volume
commodities and smaller amounts of strategically relevant raw
materials that have to meet highly demanding specifications. In
both cases Evonik is confronted with opportunities and risks
relating to the increasing volatility of the availability of raw
materials and their prices.

The operating business is dependent on the price of strategic
raw materials, especially petrochemical feedstocks obtained
directly or indirectly from crude oil. The price of renewable raw
materials is also highly volatile and is driven, for example, by
weather-dependent harvest yields. Structural changes in
exchange rates are another significant aspect affecting price risks.
These risks are hedged by optimizing the global focus of
procurement activities, for example, by accessing new markets
and concluding market-oriented agreements. To further reduce
the price risks with regard to products that have intensive raw
material requirements, our aim is to pass both the risks and the
opportunities of fluctuations in raw material prices along to other
stages in the value chain where necessary, for example, through
price escalation clauses.

The overriding aim of the procurement strategy is to secure
the availability of raw materials on the best possible business
terms. Short- and mid-term bottlenecks in the availability of
precursors and intermediates are potential risks. As well as making
preparations to use substitute suppliers in an emergency, we con-

stantly observe the business performance of suppliers of selected
key raw materials to anticipate bottlenecks and avoid risks.

Increasing volatility requires constant monitoring of the cor-
responding risks in the value chain.

The opportunities and risks arising from changes in the price
of petrochemical feedstocks mainly affect the Performance
Materials segment because of its high procurement volume.
Risks relating to single sourcing and short-term restrictions on
the availability of raw materials mainly affect the Nutrition &
Care and Resource Efficiency segments.

Supply chain

Compliance with sustainability criteria in the supply chain is a
central aspect of procurement. We expect our suppliers to share
our principles of entrepreneurial responsibility. We therefore have
our own code of conduct for suppliers, based on the principles of
the UN Global Compact, the International Labour Standards issued
by the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the Respon-
sible Care® initiative. Globally, this approach to sustainability is
also supported by the sector initiative Together for Sustainability,
of which Evonik is a founding member, through the use of
standardized assessments. Evonik’s principal suppliers and the
majority of critical suppliers have already taken part in these
assessments, which are evaluated by an impartial sustainability
rating company.

4. Other

A steady improvement in our cost position is necessary to make
us more competitive. Our goal is to achieve a lasting reduction in
selling and administrative expenses of €200 million by 2021
through our SG&A 2020 program. Besides the potential to raise
strategic flexibility and strengthen the operating units as a result

COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Opportunity and risk report
Market and competition opportunities and risks

©8690090

Main table of contents

of SG&A 2020 and other restructuring projects, there are risks
relating to their implementation. These include delays in imple-
mentation, the loss of key personnel, ineffectiveness of measures,
and higher costs for the realization of measures. Stringent project
management, including involving relevant stakeholders, is used
to counter these risks.

5. Production

As a specialty chemicals company, Evonik is exposed to the risk
of business interruptions, quality problems, and unexpected
technical and IT malfunctions. Capacity constraints could hold
back organic growth. We use complex production processes,
some of them with interdependent production steps. Conse-
quently, disruption and stoppages can adversely affect subse-
quent production steps and products. The outage of production
facilities and interruptions in production workflows could have a
significant negative influence on business and earnings perfor-
mance and could also harm people and the environment. Group-
wide policies on project and quality management, highly qualified
employees, and regular maintenance of our plants effectively
minimize these risks. Insofar as is economically viable, we take
out insurance to cover damage to our plants and sites and
production stoppages, so the financial consequences of potential
production risks are largely insured. Nevertheless, there is a risk
of unforeseeable individual incidents.

6. Human resources

As a global corporation, we respect the principles of the Interna-
tional Charter of Human Rights, the ten principles of the UN
Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enter-
prises, and the International Labour Standards of the International
Labour Organization (ILO). Compliance with all employment laws
is especially important to us.
59

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

Qualified specialists and managers are the basis for the achieve-
ment of our strategic and operational targets, and thus a key
competitive factor. Both the loss of key personnel and difficulties
in attracting and hiring skilled and talented staff could therefore
constitute a risk in this context.

To ensure that we can recruit and retain qualified staff to
meet our future requirements, we offer varied employment
opportunities worldwide, systematic personnel development,
and competitive remuneration. As a responsible employer, Evonik
helps the majority of employees build financial security to cover
adverse risk factors such as the risk of accident or disability, and
o provide for retirement, either directly or through pension con-
ributions to external institutions. The arrangements are based on
he economic, legal, and tax situation in the various countries. In
addition to this, we foster the personal wellbeing of employees
hrough programs such as well@work, a range of consulting
offers for employees caring for close relatives, and support in
childcare. In this way, we retain and foster high-performers and
alented employees, and position Evonik as an attractive
employer for prospective staff. We maintain close links to univer-
sities and professional associations to help us recruit suitable
youngsters. Both our employer branding and many internal activ-
ities are aligned to diversity. The aim is to make Evonik even
more attractive to talented specialists and managers. !

Our strategic human resources planning identifies require-
ments for a five-year period, so timely steps can be taken to
cover future personnel needs. We have thus largely limited
potential human resources risks. Opportunities and risks for the
development of personnel expenses could come, for example,
from future collective agreements.

1 See section 5.1 Employees | p. 43 ff.

7. Energy markets

Evonik requires considerable amounts of energy from a wide
variety of sources for its chemical facilities and infrastructure.
The main sources are natural gas, electricity, and at present, still
coal. At several major sites, our power and steam requirements
are fully or partially met by resource-efficient co-generation
plants. We constantly monitor trends on the national and interna-
tional energy markets, enabling us to respond in a risk- and
cost-conscious manner.

n countries where the sourcing of energy is not state-
regulated, we procured and traded in energy and, where neces-
sary, emission allowances (CO) allowances) within the framework
of defined risk strategies. The aim is to balance the risks and
opportunities of volatile energy markets. Depending on how the
general conditions develop, our segments could be faced with
additional costs.

For our facilities within the scope of the European emissions
trading system, adverse effects will arise from the structure of the
fourth trading period (2021 to 2030), especially a more stringent
benchmark for the allocation of free CO» allowances. In addition,
from 2021 Evonik will probably be affected by the proposed Ger-
man Fuel Emissions Trading Act (BEHG) for the (non-ETS) traffic
and heat sectors. The key factor in the economic impact will be
the extent to which the politicians follow the announced inten-
tion of including measures to protect the competitiveness of
industry. Further legislation climate protection legislation cannot
be ruled out in other jurisdictions. In the broader regulatory
context of the energy markets, the way in which the cost of
renewables is allocated among captive energy generators in
Germany is of particular significance for Evonik. In principle, we
assume that our established captive generation and the decision

to replace the coal-fired power plant at our site in Marl
(Germany) by a highly efficient gas and steam turbine plant will
continue to contribute to the competitiveness of our German
sites in the future. Possible additional costs could arise from the
increase in grid fees resulting from the shift in German energy
policy, including further state-driven cost components and pos-
sible fundamental changes to the grid fee system. Overall, we are
exposed to fluctuations in the market price and cost of various
energy sources as a result of the specific demand/supply situation
and political events. These entail both opportunities and risks.

8. Investments
Generating growth through investment entails risks as regards
the proposed scope and timing of projects. These risks are
addressed through established, structured processes. For
instance, we take an extremely disciplined approach to imple-
menting our investment program. Both projects that have not yet
started and those that are already underway are constantly
reviewed for changes in the market situation and postponed if
necessary.

At the same time, we regard building new production facilities
in regions with high growth momentum as an opportunity to
generate further profitable growth.

9. Mergers and acquisitions

Active portfolio management has high priority for Evonik as part
of our value-based management approach. We have set out clear
procedures for preparing, analyzing, and undertaking acquisitions
and divestments. In particular, these include clear rules on
accountability and approval processes. An intensive examination
of potential acquisition targets (due diligence) is undertaken
60

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

before they are acquired. This involves systematic identification
of all material opportunities and risks and an appropriate valua-
tion. Key aspects of this process are strategic focus, earnings
power, and development potential on the one hand, and any
legal, financial, and environmental risks on the other. New com-
panies are rapidly integrated into the Evonik Group and thus into
our risk management and controlling processes. Every transac-
tion of this type entails a risk that integration of the business may
not be successful or that integration costs may be unexpectedly
high, thus jeopardizing realization of the planned quantitative and
qualitative targets such as synergies.

Where businesses no longer fit our strategy or meet our
profitability requirements despite optimization, we also examine
external options. If a planned divestment is not achieved success-
fully, this could generate risks that impact the Evonik Group’s
earnings position.

10. Research and development
Opportunities for Evonik also come from market-oriented
research and development (R&D), which we regard as an
important driver of profitable growth. We have a well-stocked
R&D pipeline with a balanced mixture of short-, mid-, and long-
term R&D projects. On the one hand, we constantly strive to
improve our processes in order to strengthen our cost leadership,
and on the other, our projects open the door to new markets and
new fields of technology. Our project portfolio is consistently
aligned to our growth engines and the innovation growth fields,
which have high sustainability benefits. Through our venture
capital program, we take stakes in companies whose know-how
can support us in joint developments. Aspects of digitalization
are becoming more significant.

Opportunities and risks in R&D relate to the viability of
planned product and process developments and the timing of
their implementation. We mainly see additional potential arising

1 See declaration on corporate governance ih] p.74 ff.

from the introduction of new products that go beyond our present
planning in our six innovation growth fields.

6.4 Legal/compliance opportunities
and risks

The opportunities and risks in this category are far more difficult
to quantify than market and competition risks, as they not only
have financial implications but often also involve reputational
risks for the company and/or criminal law consequences. Provi-
sions are set up on our balance sheet to cover the financial
impact. These are reflected in our system as reducing risk. In
view of this complexity, legal /compliance opportunities and risks
are not assigned to the opportunity/risk matrix illustrated above,
nor are they allocated to the risk quantification classes.

1. Compliance, law, and the regulatory

framework

Compliance means lawful business conduct. The principal com-
pliance rules are set out in the Evonik Code of Conduct, which
explicitly prohibits, for example, all forms of corruption, includ-
ing “facilitation payments,” and violation of antitrust regulations.
Risks could result from failure to comply with the corresponding
regulations. To minimize compliance risks, extensive training and
sensitization of employees is undertaken at face-to-face training
sessions and/or through e-learning programs. Our code of con-
duct is binding for all Evonik employees worldwide, including the
executive board and the governance bodies of all Evonik compa-
nies. They are required to comply with the rules set forth in the
code of conduct, to ensure they are familiar with its content, and
to take part in the relevant training. '

COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Opportunity and risk report
Legal/compliance opportunities and risks

©8690090

Main table of contents

Evonik monitors the observance of human rights along its value
chain. To minimize the related risks, we require compliance with
our code of conduct for suppliers, our global social policy, and
the policy statement on human rights.

Evonik is exposed to legal risks, resulting, for example, from legal
disputes such as claims for compensation, and from administra-
tive proceedings and fines. In its operating business, the Evonik
Group is exposed to liability risks, especially in connection with
product liability, patent law, tax law, competition law, antitrust
law, and environmental law. Changes in public law could also
give rise to legal risks or materially alter such risk positions. As a
chemical company with its own power plants, risks of particular
relevance here are a possible change in the charges levied under
the German Renewable Energies Act (EEG) and amendments to
the European emissions trading regulations.

Further, Evonik may be liable for guarantee claims relating to
divestments. Structured post-transaction management closely
monitors any liability and guarantee risks resulting from divest-
ments. We have developed a concept involving high quality and
safety standards to ensure a controlled approach to such legal risks.

Insurance cover has been purchased for the financial conse-
quences of any loss that may occur as a result of damage to prop-
erty, product liability claims, and other risks. Where necessary,
Evonik sets up provisions for legal risks.

At present, the relevant legal risks are the issues outlined below.
As a matter of principle, we refrain from evaluating the opportu-
nities and risks of potential legal proceedings or proceedings that
have commenced, in order not to influence our position.

In connection with the divestment of the former carbon black
activities, the purchaser has now asserted its purported right to
indemnification from environmental guarantees relating, among
other things, to alleged infringement of the US Clean Air Act
61

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

through arbitration proceedings filed on June 11, 2019. Evonik has
rejected these claims in its defense and the arbitration court has
now defined the structure of proceedings up to a hearing in
spring 2021.

Following a fine imposed by the EU Commission in 2002 on
various methionine producers (including Evonik), the Brazilian
antitrust authorities have filed proceedings against Evonik in con-
nection with the delivery of methionine to Brazil. Evonik is of the
opinion that a fine cannot be imposed due to the statute of lim-
itations.

With regard to employment law, there are risks relating, for
example, to the recalculation of pension commitments entered
into by Evonik and its legal predecessors.

Tax risks relate to differences in the valuation of business
processes, capital expenditures, and restructuring by the financial
authorities, tax reforms in some countries, and potential retroactive
payments in the wake of tax audits.

2. Information security and the protection of

intellectual property and know-how

Innovations play a significant part in Evonik’s business success.
Protecting know-how and intellectual property is therefore of
central importance. With markets growing ever closer and the
globalization of business, a competent approach to protecting our
competitive edge is a key element in our investment activities.
The company is also exposed to a risk that intellectual property
cannot be adequately protected, even through patents, especially
when building new production facilities in certain countries. Sim-
ilarly, the transfer of know-how in joint ventures and other forms
of cooperation also entails a risk of an outflow of expertise from
Evonik. For example, in the event of the possible separation from
a joint venture or other cooperation partner there is no guarantee
that the business partner will not continue to use know-how or
disclose it to third parties, thereby damaging Evonik’s competi-
tive position.

1 Especially water shortages.

Measures to minimize and avoid such risks are coordinated by the
Corporate Security, Law, and Intellectual Property Management
units.

IT risks

Electronic information processing is a key element in Evonik’s
success. Therefore, sustained protection of information and the
availability, confidentiality, and integrity of IT-assisted business
processes are especially important. If these systems and informa-
tion are compromised, there is a significant risk that this could
have a detrimental effect on our business and production pro-
cesses. To protect them and the associated knowledge from
cybercrime (including industrial espionage and manipulation
through electronic attacks) from both within and outside the
Evonik Group and to minimize such risks, we have developed an
IT security strategy and established organizational and technical
measures. The secure use of information systems is described in
binding group-wide policies and regulations and driven forward
and monitored by an internal control system.

In view of the considerable and continuously rising threat, we
regularly review our security measures, implement risk-based
countermeasures as required, and adapt them wherever neces-
sary. Training, including compulsory training in some cases, and
constant information, for example, via the Evonik Group intranet
and internal social networking platforms, keep employees aware
of the need for IT security. Strictly confidential information that
Evonik needs to protect is identified and corresponding protec-
tive measures are implemented. At the same time, managers’
awareness of this issue is raised. The Evonik Cyber Defense Team
(CDT) is networked externally at various levels (Germany:
member of the German CERT network, Europe: member of
TF-CSIRT*, globally: member of FIRST).

3. Environmental risks

(environment, safety, health, quality)

Evonik is exposed to risks in the areas of occupational and plant
safety. For example, workplace accidents and incidents in pro-
duction facilities can cause injury to our employees or substance
releases that impair the health of our employees and local resi-
dents. We counter these risks by living our understanding of
safety as a holistic management task at all management levels.
Our guiding principles for safety are binding for all managers and
employees. In this way, Evonik makes it clear that safety is a
central element in its corporate culture. We analyze accidents
and incidents carefully so we can learn from them. Moreover,
audits are conducted at the request of the executive board to
check the controlled handling of such risks.

The aim of our product stewardship is timely identification
and evaluation of possible health and environmental risks in our
portfolio. We examine the entire value chain of each of our prod-
ucts—from procurement of the raw materials to delivery to our
industrial customers, who receive all relevant information on the
handling and disposal of our products. That includes, for exam-
ple, safety data sheets, and technical information sheets. As well
as complying with all statutory requirements such as the Euro-
pean chemicals regulation (REACH) and the Globally Harmo-
nized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS),
product stewardship at Evonik includes voluntary commitments
that go beyond these regulations.

The effects of climate change are already visible today, for
example, in water stress! and acute weather-related events such as
low water levels in the river Rhine and hurricanes. Alongside these
direct negative effects of climate change, we are also exposed to
risks resulting from stricter environmental regulations.

62

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

Furthermore, the group-wide environmental protection and
quality management system, which is validated as conforming to
international standards, undergoes constant development and
improvement. As a responsible chemical company, Evonik
ensures that such processes are operated in accordance with the
principles of the global Responsible Care® initiative and the UN
Global Compact.

Adequate provisions have been established to secure or
remediate contaminated sites where necessary. Alongside the
need to adjust environmental provisions identified through struc-
tured internal processes, for example as a result of changes in
the regulatory framework, further unplanned additions to such
provisions may be necessary.

6.5 Process/organization risks

1. General

This risk category covers the interface between risk management
and the internal control system (ICS). In this category, risks gen-
erally result from specific process shortcomings. Alongside gen-
eral weaknesses, these include, in particular, risks within the ICS
and the accounting-related ICS. Classification is therefore based
on the list of processes drawn up by Corporate Audit. Starting
from key corporate processes, the existence of relevant control
objectives and standard controls for the main risks identified is

1 Europe, Middle East and Africa.

checked. In view of the types of risk in this category, a purely
qualitative assessment is normally used.

The evaluation of specific risks resulting from weaknesses in
processes within the organizational units showed very little scope
to optimize existing processes because of the efficacy of the cur-
rent controls. The corresponding scope for improvement has
been identified. There are therefore no signs of systematic errors
in the Evonik Group’s ICS.

2. Internal control system for financial

accounting
The main financial reporting risks are identified in the ICS
through a quantitative and a qualitative analysis. Controls are
defined for each risk area of the accounting process. Their efficacy
is reviewed at regular intervals and improved where necessary. All
elements of the control process are verified by the internal audit
function on the basis of random samples.

To ensure the quality of financial statements, we have a
group-wide policy, which defines uniform accounting and valua-
tion principles for all German and foreign companies included in
the consolidated financial statements for the Evonik Group. The
majority of companies have delegated the preparation of their
financial statements to Global Financial Services. Through sys-
tematic process orientation, standardization, and the utilization of
economies of scale, this leverages sustained cost benefits and
also improves the quality of accounting. Global Financial Services
has developed a standardized control matrix for the internal con-
trol system for financial accounting. This is implemented in the

three global shared service centers: in Offenbach (Germany) for
Germany, Austria, and Finland; in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) for
the Asia region and countries in the EMEA’ region not served by
the Offenbach center; and in San Jose (Costa Rica) for the Amer-
icas region. The aim is to ensure a uniform global standard for the
internal control system for financial accounting. In principle, the
annual financial statements of all fully consolidated companies
and all joint operations are audited. In the few exceptions from
this rule, an upfront risk assessment is performed with the audi-
tor.

All data are consolidated by the Accounting division using the
SAP SEM-BCS system. Group companies submit their financial
statements via a web-based interface. A range of technical valida-
tions is performed at this stage. Computerized and manual process
controls and checking by a second person are the key oversight
functions performed in the financial reporting process. The prepa-
ration of the monthly consolidated income statement and publi-
cation of three quarterly reports allow us to gain experience with
new accounting issues, and provide a sound basis for plausibiliza-
tion of the year-end accounts. The executive board receives
monthly reports, and quarterly reports are submitted to the audit
committee of the supervisory board.

Aspects that may represent opportunities or risks for financial
reporting in the future are identified and evaluated early through
the risk management system. This ensures that risk management
can be closely aligned to controlling and accounting processes.

FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 EVONIK

7.1 Economic background

Global economy expected to stabilize at around the
prior-year level

We expect global economic conditions to remain challenging in
2020. However, a further escalation of the trade dispute between
the USA and China should be avoided in the wake of the partial
agreement. In view of this year’s presidential election, the US
administration will presumably refrain from further protectionist
measures, so global trade should stabilize somewhat. Economic
development in 2020 should be supported by a continuation of
the expansionary monetary policy throughout the world. More-
over, various economies are using state intervention to prevent a
further economic downturn. Overall, we expect global growth in
2020 to be around last year’s level at 2.5 percent.

We assume that the pace of growth in Western Europe will slow
slightly year-on-year in 2020. Although a further escalation of
the global trade war was avoided at the end of 2019, there are
still a number of trade policy risks. These include the uncertainty
with regard to the future economic relationship between the
European Union and the UK. This uncertainty will continue in
2020 and is likely to hold back economic development. By con-
trast, the economy in Western Europe will be supported by the
good employment situation and robust consumer spending
against the backdrop of ongoing expansionary monetary policy.

In North America, we assume that the robust growth will
continue, although the pace could moderate somewhat as a con-
sequence of the global weakness. Growth will continue to be
driven by buoyant consumer demand and a strong labor market.
Monetary policy is expected to remain accommodating. A hike in
the key interest rate during the year is unlikely in our view.

mmm 2020 (forecast) 2019 (expected)

Growth in Central & South America should pick up in 2020.
However, the lack of tailwind from the global economy and
political uncertainty in some countries could prevent a clear
brightening of the economic outlook in this region. Nevertheless,
the basic conditions have improved, not least thanks to the more
relaxed US monetary policy.

Growth will remain high in the Asia-Pacific region. Economic
momentum in Japan will probably be slightly lower than in 2019
despite the expansionary monetary and fiscal policy. In view of
the continued trade policy risks, we expect the Chinese govern-
ment to take further action to support the economy and antici-
pate that economic growth will be slightly lower than in 2019.

The projection for the world economy is still hampered by uncer-
tainty. Despite the partial agreement in the trade dispute
between the USA and China, there is still a risk that a renewed
flare-up could significantly dampen global economic activity. The
risk that the dispute could spread directly to other regions
remains a threat to global trade and the global economy in our
view. Another risk factor for the global economy is escalation of
the political conflicts in the Middle East, which could have nega-
tive implications for the price of oil. A sharper slowdown in the
Chinese economy, partly as a result of the coronavirus (SARS-
CoV-2), would cause a significant slowing of global growth. Fur-
thermore, the continued uncertainty about the future economic
relationship between the European Union and the UK is likely to
dampen growth momentum. The global economic development
could also deteriorate if central banks were to tighten monetary
policy, although this is not expected at present. Another risk is
that the downturn in industry could spread to other sectors of the
economy and therefore impact consumption, which is still very
robust at present.

We estimate that global inflation will remain fairly constant as a
result of moderate global growth momentum and the expecta-
tion that raw material prices will be stable.

Although uncertainty remains high on the world’s markets, we
expect raw material prices to remain basically stable. Overall, we
expect that in 2020 prices of Evonik-specific raw materials will
be slightly lower than in 2019.

We assume that in 2020 the average euro exchange rate will be
around the 2019 level, based on the current basic data for the
euro zone and the USA.

7.2 Outlook

Basis for our outlook:

+ Global growth of 2.5 percent (2019: 2.6 percent)

+ Euro/US dollar exchange rate: US$1.12 (2019: USS1.12)

+ Internal raw material cost index slightly below the prior year

Sales and earnings
The following outlook includes the contribution from the US
company PeroxyChem (transaction closed on February 3, 2020).

Due to the anticipated and ongoing muted development of global
growth momentum, as outlined in the section 7.1 economic
background [) p.64, we expect sales to be stable in 2020 (2019:
€13.1 billion).

The specialty businesses in our portfolio should continue to
grow. Together with the continued implementation of our effi-
ciency measures, they should contribute to a sustained structural
improvement in the earnings quality of the portfolio. On the
other hand, the muted macroeconomic environment is expected
to affect the remaining commodity businesses in our portfolio.
Overall, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between €2.0 billion
and €2.3 billion (2019: €2.153 billion).

1 Before one-off tax payments relating to the carve-out of the methacrylates business.

We assume a continuation of the volume growth and positive
earnings trend for the specialties in the Nutrition & Care seg-
ment. For our essential amino acids for animal nutrition, we
expect ongoing strong volume growth, with average annual
prices around the previous year’s level. In the Baby Care busi-
ness, we expect lower earnings than in the previous year. Over-
all, earnings in the Nutrition & Care segment are expected to be
slightly above the previous year’s level.

In 2020, the Resource Efficiency segment will continue to be
affected by the lower growth situation in some end-markets,
such as the automotive and coatings sectors. Nevertheless, this
segment will continue to benefit from its diversified market posi-
tions and the trend to resource-efficient solutions. Operationally,
we expect business performance to be fairly stable. However, the
high level of license income generated in 2019 will not recur in
2020. Contributions from the acquired PeroxyChem business will
have a positive effect on segment sales and earnings. Overall, we
expect earnings to be at least at the same level as in the previous
year.

In the Performance Materials segment, product spreads are
expected to weaken year-on-year due to the continued weakness
of the market environment. By contrast, the negative impact from
limited raw material supply and plant outages in 2019 should not
recur. Overall, this segment is expected to generate stable to
slightly lower earnings in 2020.

In 2020, the return on capital employed (ROCE) is expected to
remain at last year’s level (2019: 8.6 percent).

Financing and investments
In 2020, we expect capital expenditures to remain stable at the
low prior-year level (2019: €842 million).

We are targeting another slight improvement in the free cash
flow in 2020 (2019: €717 million”). Positive contributions will
come from continued high capital expenditure discipline and
strict working capital management, as well as from lower bonus
payments for 2019. By contrast, we expect higher tax payments
and cash outflows for the SG&A 2020 efficiency enhancement
program.

Occupational and plant safety

Our aim is to avoid all accidents and incidents. We are working to
achieve an improvement in our accident frequency indicator
compared with 2019 (1.18) and expect that it will remain below
the defined upper limit of 1.30 in 2020. We anticipate that we
can achieve a slight improvement in our plant safety indicator,
incident frequency (2019: 1.10) and that it will be below the
upper limit of 1.10.
