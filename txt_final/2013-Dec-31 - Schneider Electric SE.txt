> 1. Trends in Schneider Electric’s

core markets

Industries and machine manufacturers

Continuing improvement of global growth and business climate
(PMI) over the year has at last resulted in a rise of industry market
during the second half of 2013. However, it remains subdued on a
global level with varied positions across major regional blocks.

Western Europe GDP exited from recession in Q2 and slightly
increased since then. Against this backdrop, industry market
stabilized one quarter later lifting out of a long and severe
recession. Most zones have experienced a sequential improvement
at year end, including Spain and Italy.

In North America, manufacturing companies have benefited from
stronger external demand from Europe and China in the course of
the year. Companies were also helped by lower energy costs
thanks to shale gas. Despite those positive factors, the growth of
industry market, mainly driven by investment in equipment and
production of machines, was moderate.

Non residential and residential buildings

Indeed, the market has already reached a high level after the
strong cyclical recovery in 2010 and 2011 and generous taxation
policies for equipment spending. Furthermore, uncertainties linked
to the debt ceiling debate and Government shutdown weighed on
companies’ investment behavior.

In China, industry market growth rebounded, driven by
improvement of external demand and investment in machines.
Automation offer benefited from Chinese manufactures’ needs to
increase efficiency so to reduce impact from labor cost increases.

In Japan, industry market bounced during the second half of the
year, machine manufacturers producers benefiting from gain in
competitiveness allowed by Yen depreciation.

In other new economies as a whole, industry market slowed down
during the second half of the year, hampered by capital outflows
and tightened credit markets (Russia, India, some East Asian
countries...).

Non residential buildings

In Western Europe, non residential construction continued to fall,
notably in Southern Countries (Spain, Italy, and France), penalized
by private-sector deleveraging and public-sector austerity. In
United Kingdom, improving business confidence has encouraged
firms to lift their investment, and non residential construction has
stabilized in the course of the year.

In the US, non residential construction as a whole grew at a low
pace. Positive growth in commercial buildings was offset by a
decrease in public buildings. Most publicly funded segments
recorded decrease as a result of fiscal pressure and government
spending cuts.

Residential

Growth in residential market outperformed other construction
categories in 2013, driven by the US, Japan, and a lower rate of
decrease in Western Europe.

In North America, residential construction has continued to recover
at a strong pace in the US, for the third consecutive year,
sustained by employment growth, demography, price increase and
lower inventory. On the contrary, the market turned down in
Canada and Mexico.

In Western Europe, residential market bottomed out during the
third quarter and slightly decreased on a yearly basis compared to
2012. The decrease was due to Southern Countries: Spain, Italy

In China, the market experienced a strong growth in 2013, driven
by a rebound in company’s capex, government investments,
continuously raising rental prices and urbanization. Growth stayed
resilient during the second half of the year, despite reportedly
tighter mortgage conditions.

In Australia, the market has recovered at a moderate pace.

In India, market grew at a low pace, hampered by high interest
rates and structural constraints.

In Saudi Arabia, despite a vast pipeline of projects the market was
hit by labor shortages resulting from new labor laws.

and France. The market was close to flat in Germany and Nordics
and slightly rose in United Kingdom.

In Australia, the market returned to growth after a deep recession
in 2012.

In China, residential construction has gradually risen during the
year despite reportedly tighter mortgage conditions and the
introduction of new tightening measures in big cities.

In other new economies as a whole, residential market continued
to grow in 2013, notably in South America and Africa. India, Russia
and some East Asian countries were impacted by the financial
turmoil in emerging markets, higher interest rates and fiscal
tightening.

Utilities and Infrastructures

BUSINESS REVIEW
TRENDS IN SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC’S CORE MARKETS

Electrical Utilities

Strong regional differences have recently emerged in the utility
space. Europe is in the middle of turbulences during the early
steps of the energy transition, primarily affecting the conventional
power generators, while other geographies follow a more stable
path.

On the grid side of mature economies, the attention paid to quality
of supply (outages, power quality) is greater than ever, justifying
investments to rejuvenate aging networks, incorporation new smart
grid technologies while integrating the increasing number of
distributed energy resources.

Utilities must meet these regulatory obligations in a context of
weak or even negative consumption growth, as well as societal
pressure to maintain competitive electricity prices. In emerging
economies, the need of additional capacities to meet consumption
growth keeps on driving the utility sector.

Those factors will drive sustainable investments in utility networks
across all geographies.

The regulatory pressure on electric utilities is increasing, mainly in
mature markets. In addition to the mandates on renewable
integration, energy efficiency targets are being implemented, giving
new obligations to utility operators to stimulate their customers

Data centers and Networks

In 2018, the Global IT markets (Information Technologies) were
impacted by a weaker economic environment. In particular in the
United States, the uncertainty linked to the debt ceiling debate and
Federal Reserve tapering of bond-buying combined with the
October Government shutdown created conditions for a slowdown
and a volatility of IT investments.

In Europe, some Western countries remained in recession in 2013,
but the country which has faced the sharpest decrease of its IT
market is Russia. Capital outflows, restrictive fiscal and monetary
policies in order to fight inflation created adverse economic
conditions for investment.

towards more energy efficient consumption practices and
demand-side participation to grid operation.

The traditional utility business model where revenues were
predominantly based on electricity volumes is slowly challenged.
Conventional centralized generation is gradually losing ground to
new distributed generation plants.

Oil and Gas

In 2013, Oil & Gas markets have confirmed the recovery engaged
since 2010.

The global gas market is undergoing significant changes. The US
became self-sufficient in Energy and is preparing export
capabilities, Europe consumption is pausing due to the crisis, and
infrastructures are being build-up in Asia (export from Australia,
Pipelines into China...).

In the Oil & Gas market, Schneider Electric is positioned to deliver
solutions across all the Oil & Gas value chain, with application
focus on energy management and infrastructure optimization.

The Invensys acquisition further reinforces Software and Process
Automation capabilities, in particular in downstream and
petrochemicals.

The transactional single phase market experienced a significant
growth in Asia offsetting more difficult situations in North America,
Western Europe and Russia.

The migration to the Cloud, Collocation and growth in larger Data
Centers accelerated, needing new customer engagement models
as well as faster adaptation of Schneider Electric's offer.

Strong growth of Data-centers market in Asia was offset by softer
trends in North America and to lower extent in Western Europe.

financial statements

Review of business and consolidated statement of income

Changes in the scope of consolidation

Acquisitions

Schneider Electric finalized on March 28, 2013, the acquisition of
100% of Electroshield - TM Samara, further to the 50% acquired in
October 2010, after obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals in
Russia. Electroshield - TM Samara is one of the leading Russian
players in medium voltage. The cumulative price for 100% of equity
is RUB 20.4 billion (about EUR510 million) with net debt of zero as
of today. As agreed, the second half of the equity was acquired on
March 28, 2013 at the same value paid for the first half in
October 2010. Previously it was accounted under the equity
accounting method. It is fully consolidated since April 1, 2013 in
the segment Infrastructure.

Since then, Electroshield - TM Samara is consolidated with full
consolidated method.

Acquisitions and disposals that took place in 2012 and
that had an impact on the 2013 financial statements *

M&C Energy Group has been acquired during financial year 2012
and consolidated from June 15, 2012. Its consolidation on a
full-year basis for financial year 2013 had a scope effect compared
to financial year 2012.

Changes in foreign exchange rates

Changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the euro had a
material impact over the year. This negative effect amounts to
EUR879 million on consolidated revenue and to EUR233 million on
Adjusted EBITA”.

Revenue

On December 31, 2013, the consolidated revenue of Schneider
Electric totaled EUR23,551 million, a decrease of 1.6% at current
scope and exchange rates compared to December 31, 2012.

This variance breaks down into an organic increase of 0.4%, a
contribution of acquisitions net of disposals of 1.7%, mainly due to
Electroshield, and a negative exchange rate effect of 3.7%.

Changes in revenue by operating segment

The Partner business generated revenues of EUR8,476 million, or
36% of the consolidated total. This represents a decrease of -3.0%
on a reported basis and +0.2% on a like-for-like basis. The
Product business was slightly up, supported by continued
investment in the residential market in the United States, overall
good performance in China and fast-growing mid-market offers in
new economies. The sluggish economy in Europe and the slow
construction market in Australia weighed on performance. The
Solution business declined, impacted by high comparables in the
Middle East and difficulties in the renewable market in Western
Europe, while data center projects in North America recorded
growth.

The Infrastructure business generated revenues of
EURS5,728 million, or 24% of the consolidated total. This
represents an increase of +6.7% on a reported basis and +1.2%
on a like-for-like basis. The Product business was up slightly, as
the good performance of secondary distribution products offset
the decline of primary MV components. The Solution business
grew despite continued weak utility investment in Western Europe,
mainly driven by the success of installed base and advanced
services across regions, demand in the Oil & Gas segment in
Australia and in the data center segment in North America.

The Industry business generated revenues of EUR4,311 million,
or 18% of the consolidated total. This represents a decrease of
-3.8% on a reported basis and an increase of +1.3% on a
like-for-like basis. The product business was up slightly, reflecting
good demand from OEMs (machine manufacturers) across all
regions after a soft start in mature countries in the first half. The
solution business posted good growth, driven by the success of
SoMachine OEM solutions and installed base services.

The IT business generated revenues of EUR3,442 million, or 15%
of the consolidated total. This represents a decrease of -6.4% ona
reported basis and -1.4% like-for-like basis, with mixed trends
between Products and Solutions. The Product business grew,

critical power in some new economies. The Solution business
declined, as North America experienced slow project activity for
small to mid-sized data centers and demand in Western Europe
was soft.

The Buildings business generated revenues of EUR1,594 million,
or 7% of the consolidated total. This represents a decrease of
-5.2% on a reported basis, while organic growth was flat at -0.2%.

revenues, gross profit remained stable at 37.8% in 2012 and 2013
thanks to the industrial productivity that was the key driver along
with positive pricing for the organic improvement despite a low
volume environment and unfavorable mix effect.

Support Function Costs: Research and development and selling,

general and administrative expenses

Research and development expenses, excluding capitalized
development costs and development costs reported as cost of
sales, increased by 5.5% from EURS507 million for the year ended
December 31, 2012 to EURS535 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013. As a percentage of revenues, the net cost of
research and development increased to 2.3% of revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2013 (2.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2012).

Total research and development expenses, including capitalized
development costs and development costs reported as cost of sales
(see note 4 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements) increased
by 8.2% from EUR1,058 million for the year ended December 31, 2012
to EUR1,145 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. As a
percentage of revenues, total research and development expenses
increased to 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 4.4%
for the year ended December 31, 2012.

In 2013, the net effect of capitalized development costs and
amortization of capitalized development costs amounts to
EUR179 million on operating income (EUR153 million in 2012).

Other operating income and expenses

For the year ended December 31, 2013, other operating income
and expenses amounted to a net income of EUR73 million,
including costs linked to acquisitions for EUR52 million, a
EUR173 million gain on the curtailment of employee benefit plans
in the U.S., in France and in Norway and miscellaneous other
operating incomes and expenses amounting to a net expense of
EUR48 million. Costs linked to acquisitions are acquisition,
integration and separation costs on 2013 acquisitions, notably
Electroshield - TM Samara and acquisition costs linked to Invensys
(see note 30, Post-closing events). Net other operating expense
includes mainly provisions for litigation or claims and gain on
disposal of fixed assets.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 1.8%
from EURS5,035 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 to
EUR4,944 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. As a
percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative
expenses remained stable at 21.0% for both 2013 and 2012, as
operational efficiency had compensated most of investments.

Combined, total support function costs, that is, research and
development expenses together with selling, general and
administrative costs, totaled EUR5,479 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013 compared to EUR5,542 million for the year

Restructuring costs

For the year ended December 31, 2013, restructuring costs amounted to EUR176 million compared to EUR164 million for the year ended
December 31, 2012. These costs related to industrial and support functions restructurings.

EBITA and Adjusted EBITA

We define EBITA as earnings before interest, taxes and
amortization of purchase accounting intangibles. EBITA comprises
operating profit before amortization and impairment of purchase
accounting intangible assets and before goodwill impairment.

We define adjusted EBITA as EBITA before restructuring costs and
before other operating income and expenses, which includes
acquisition, integration and separation costs.

Adjusted EBITA amounted to EUR3,412 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, compared to EUR3,515 million for the year
ended December 31, 2012, representing a decrease of 2.9%, due

to negative currency effect of EUR233 million that offset high
industrial productivity. As a percentage of revenue, adjusted EBITA
decreased from 14.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012 to
14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013, only due to
negative currency and scope effects.

EBITA decreased by 1.0% from EUR3,341 million for the year
ended December 31, 2012 to EUR3,309 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, mainly linked to the decrease of adjusted
EBITA. As a percentage of revenue, EBITA increased to 14.1% in
2013 compared with 14.0% in 2012.
