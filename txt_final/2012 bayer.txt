The globally operating HealthCare subgroup is divided into two reporting segments: Pharmaceuticals and
Consumer Health. The Pharmaceuticals segment focuses on prescription products, especially for women’s
healthcare and cardiology and also in the fields of oncology, hematology and ophthalmology. Our Con-
sumer Health segment includes the Consumer Care, Medical Care and Animal Health divisions. The main
focus of the Consumer Care Division is on non-prescription medicines, dietary supplements and derma-
tology products. Medical Care comprises the businesses with blood glucose meters, contrast-enhanced
diagnostic imaging equipment together with the necessary contrast agents, and mechanical systems for
treating constricted or blocked blood vessels. The products of the Animal Health Division are destined for
use in livestock and companion animals.

CropScience has businesses in seeds, crop protection and non-agricultural pest control. It is organized
into two operating segments: Crop Protection/Seeds and Environmental Science. Crop Protection/Seeds
markets a portfolio of high-value seeds and traits along with innovative chemical and biological pest man-
agement solutions, at the same time offering extensive service backup for modern, sustainable agricul-
ture. Environmental Science focuses on non-agricultural applications, with a broad portfolio of pest con-
trol products and services for areas ranging from the home and garden sector to forestry.

MaterialScience develops, manufactures and markets high-performance products in the areas of poly-
urethanes, polycarbonates, coating and adhesive raw materials, and functional films. This subgroup also
manufactures and markets selected inorganic basic chemicals. MaterialScience is organized into the
Polyurethanes, Polycarbonates, and Coatings, Adhesives, Specialties business units, and the Industrial
Operations area.

CHANGES IN CORPORATE STRUCTURE

In August 2012, we implemented organizational changes within the MaterialScience segment. The
Vulkollan business with high-performance elastomers is no longer part of the Polyurethanes business
unit but is reported under the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialties (cas) business unit. The prior-year
figures are restated accordingly.

In September 2012, we renamed the BioScience business unit within the CropScience segment to
“Seeds.” In addition, the Seed Treatment business unit was renamed to “SeedGrowth.”

As of the fourth quarter of 2012, the Pharmaceuticals segment of the HealthCare subgroup is no longer
divided into General Medicine and Specialty Medicine business units due to organizational changes.
3. Strategy

BUSINESS STRATEGY

As an innovation company with the mission “Bayer: Science For A Better Life,” Bayer focuses on its core
competencies in developing new solutions for the fast-growing, innovation-driven areas of health care,
agriculture and high-tech materials. Based on this innovation capability and other core competencies, we
are pursuing a value-creating strategy of sustainable and profitable growth in our businesses. In doing so
we consistently exploit both organic and external growth opportunities while at the same time optimizing
structures and processes and improving our cost base.

Portfolio: We plan to continue playing leading roles in attractive markets and to steadily expand the strong
positions we already hold, placing special emphasis on the development of our life-science businesses.
We also aim to leverage research synergies by gaining a better understanding of human, animal and
plant biology. In MaterialScience, we intend to defend our market position through leading-edge process
technologies. Investments in capacity expansions and new facilities are creating economies of scale and
cost leadership that will help to strengthen our position and our profitability.

Growth: We are systematically investing in our innovation capabilities and maximizing the value of
our research and development pipeline and our technological expertise. We are also taking advantage
of opportunities in the emerging markets.

Productivity: Based on the maxim “More innovation — less administration,” we are continuing our efforts
to improve efficiency and simplify structures and processes throughout the Bayer Group.

HEALTHCARE

The health care sector worldwide is in a state of flux. Here we face four main challenges at the global level:
an aging population, the growing demand for health care products in the emerging markets, greater
patient and consumer influence on health-related decisions, and increasing insistence that the health care
industry demonstrate the value added by new therapies. In addition, health systems everywhere need to
find new ways to curb rising costs while safeguarding and improving the quality and reach of health care.
Against this background, HealthCare’s goal is to improve people’s quality of life through innovation.

The objective of our strategy is to achieve above-average, profitable and sustainable growth. To this end,
our focus is on innovation and on further strengthening our position in the emerging markets. Our re-
search pipeline contains projects with the potential to spawn innovative products that will improve treat-
ment options, especially for chronic illnesses that particularly affect the growing number of older people
in the global population. In selected areas we are working to round out our portfolio, partly with more
value-based approaches and services. Here we also benefit from our expertise in the areas of prescrip-
tion medicines and consumer products. In addition, we aim to further strengthen our position among the
leading suppliers of non-prescription (oTC) medicines and expand our presence in the emerging mar-
kets. The umbrella brand “Bayer,” with its excellent worldwide reputation, especially in the area of
health care, will also have a central role to play.

Our largest segment in terms of sales - Pharmaceuticals — aims to become a leader in cardiovascular
health and continue to expand the leading position it already holds in women’s healthcare. In the area of
specialty therapeutics, we are pursuing niche strategies to strengthen or defend our respective market
positions. This focus on specific business areas is supplemented by growth strategies in the key markets
of Brazil, China and Russia.

Focus on
growth through
innovation
Strategy with four
key elements

Innovative products are of central importance for the sustainability of the Pharmaceuticals business. We
therefore plan to increase our investment in research and development in the future, focusing mainly on
oncology and cardiovascular health with additional activities in gynecological therapies, hematology, oph-
thalmology and inflammatory diseases.

Our Consumer Health segment includes non-prescription medicines, dermatology products, blood
glucose meters, medical devices and contrast agents, as well as pharmaceutical and grooming products
for livestock and companion animals.

The goal of the Consumer Care Division is to build on our position in the over-the-counter (OTC)
medicines market, with the focus on expanding our business in the emerging markets of Eastern
Europe, Latin America and Asia. We primarily intend to exploit the organic growth potential of proven
brands such as Aspirin™, Aleve™/naproxen, Bepanthen™/Bepanthol™ and Canesten™. In addition, we
will continue to take advantage of external growth opportunities in the form of acquisitions or product
inlicensing.

In the Medical Care Division, we are aiming to build on our competitive positions in the core areas of
diabetes management, contrast agents and medical devices. We plan to expand our product range for
people with diabetes by developing new blood glucose monitoring systems and innovative, customer-
centric solutions to help them better manage the disease. In the Radiology and Interventional unit,
further development work is ongoing in the areas of contrast agents, contrast agent injection systems,
and thrombectomy and atherectomy systems. We are also developing new software and IT-based service
solutions to optimize both contrast agent dosage and the clinical workflows involved in processing
diagnostic data and images.

In the Animal Health Division, we aim to build on the leading position we hold among suppliers of
products for companion animals and livestock. Our strategy is to achieve organic growth by focusing on
countries and markets with long-term sales potential and successfully managing the life cycles of exist-
ing core brands. We aim to step up the development of new proprietary products to safeguard our
long-term success. In addition, we are pursuing external growth opportunities through acquisitions and
product inlicensing.

CROPSCIENCE

The earth's population is predicted to reach nine billion by 2050. As the number of people grows, natural
resources are becoming scarcer — mainly due to insufficient arable land reserves, increasing urbaniza-
tion and progressive climate change. The importance of sustainable agriculture and of higher crop yields
and quality in producing sufficient food on a limited amount of land is increasing all the time.

CropScience, one of the leading innovation-driven companies in its industry, aligns its corporate plan-
ning to long-term trends in agricultural markets, offering products and customer-oriented solutions for
the production of high-quality food, feed, fiber and renewable raw materials. Our goal is to raise agricul-
tural productivity through innovation.

CropScience’s strategy for future growth is built on four key elements: enhancing the Crop Protection
portfolio, increasing customer centricity along the entire value chain, leading the way in innovation, and
expanding the Seeds business.

We aim to enhance our Crop Protection portfolio by innovating, concentrating on core markets and
focusing on integrated crop protection solutions. We had removed all wHo class 1 insecticides from our
portfolio by the end of 2012. In line with our commitment to sustainable agriculture, crop protection
products in this category are to be replaced with new, user-friendly and more environmentally compati-
ble formulations. The acquisition of u.s. company AgraQuest, Inc. adds to our portfolio of biological crop
protection solutions and strengthens our business, particularly in the area of fruits and vegetables.
Another major part of our strategy is to increase customer centricity along the entire value chain and
improve channel management practices. We are also steadily expanding the successful business model of
food chain partnerships in the form of collaborations with food producers and retailers.

To lead the way in innovation, we have refocused our research and development. A major focus of our
activities is on seeds and on new growth areas such as plant health and stress tolerance. The goal of the
new structure is to better exploit and develop our expertise in areas such as abiotic stress tolerance or
yield improvement for the three research areas of seeds, small molecules and biologics. Accordingly, we
have focused the new organization on integrating the three research areas. A joint global function will be
established to steer regulatory issues.

Another key element in our strategy is the continuing expansion of our Seeds business. We plan to fur-
ther strengthen our positions in our established crops — vegetables, rice, oilseed rape/canola and cotton —
through both organic growth and acquisitions. We also intend to build significant positions in soybeans
and wheat. For example, we intend to gain long-term access to high-quality breeding material through ac-
quisitions, inlicensing and partnerships and to steadily expand our existing breeding expertise.

MATERIALSCIENCE

The growing world population and the resulting depletion of fossil resources, increasing mobility and
progressive urbanization are among the global challenges of our time. People are also placing increasing
importance on a modern and more comfortable lifestyle.

With its high-tech materials and solutions, MaterialScience is helping to address these challenges in ar-
eas including energy and resource efficiency, environmentally friendly mobility and sustainable con-
struction, which are particularly important growth drivers in emerging economies such as China, India
and Brazil. We therefore expect the increase in volumes at MaterialScience to outpace global GbP growth
in the long term.

Within the scope of our strategy, we endeavor to exploit profitable business opportunities in the emerg-
ing markets amid challenging competitive conditions while safeguarding our existing positions in the
traditional markets. Among our core competencies is the development of new and better manufacturing
processes for our products. These process innovations provide cost benefits that enable us to open up
new applications in further markets and offer customized solutions.

We aim to earn a premium on our capital costs for the long term and thus contribute to increasing cor-
porate value.

In the Polyurethanes (PUR) business unit, we aim to build on our global leadership position as an inte-
grated raw material and systems supplier and achieve profitable growth.

We are focusing on further improving cost efficiency at our production facilities to safeguard our cost lead-
ership for the long term. For example, we are continuing to develop the oxygen-depolarized cathode elec-
trolysis process for producing chlorine from salt. This process enables lower energy consumption and a re-
duction in indirect co, emissions compared with conventional technologies. We are also setting new
standards in climate protection and efficiency with the new gas-phase phosgenation process for isocyanate
production.

MaterialScience
helps to address
global challenges
Investment in our production capacities is making an important contribution to the operational growth
of this business unit and the improvement of our cost base. For example, we intend to consolidate our
production of Mp1 and TDI at world-scale facilities. To service the rapidly growing demand in Asia, we
also plan to further expand our MDI capacities in Shanghai, China.

The focus of our activities in the Polycarbonates (Pcs) business unit is also on the Asian market. Asia
accounts for more than 60% of the global polycarbonates market, which is forecast to grow consider-
ably faster than global cpp in volume terms. There is particularly strong demand for this plastic in China.

We plan to gradually expand our Pcs capacities in Shanghai, China. Here we continue to rely on the effi-
ciency of our large-scale facilities.

In the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialties (CAS) business unit, we aim to maintain our leading position in
the core business with polyurethane-based raw materials for the coatings and adhesives industry and
open up new, related growth areas. Our chemical expertise and our years of formulating experience
make us a preferred partner for customers in developing and supplying tailored solutions for innovative
coating and adhesive applications.

Global economic growth continued to slow in 2012. This was mainly due to the crisis in the eurozone,
which caused tangible anxiety among consumers and investors. In addition, governments in many in-
dustrialized countries were forced to adopt a rigid consolidation course in view of the high levels of
public debt. Growth was also hampered by the fact that oil prices remained high despite the downturn in
the economy. There was, however, a positive stimulus from the still very expansionary monetary policy
in the industrialized countries.

HEALTHCARE

The more restrictive health policy framework held back the expansion of the pharmaceuticals market in
the United States and the major European countries. On the other hand, demand for prescription medi-
cines in the emerging markets rose as health services became accessible to increasingly broad segments
of the population.

The rate of growth in the global consumer care market was slightly below the previous year. This was
mainly due to a weak second half, especially in the United States and Europe. Demand for over-the-
counter medicines in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and Russia remained at a high level. The
slight upturn in the medical care market was partly the result of growth in the u.s. diabetes care market
and in the market for contrast agents and medical equipment. The animal health market grew at the
average rate experienced in recent years.
CROPSCIENCE

The global seed and crop protection market continued to show dynamic development in 2012. Demand
for high-value seeds continued to rise considerably overall, and the global crop protection market also
posted significant growth.

Farmers benefited from continuing high prices thanks to persistently low inventories for most agricul-
tural commodities. This in turn triggered strong demand for high-value seeds and for crop protection

products.

Growth rates in Europe were above the average, especially in the Eastern European countries, although
demand in the Mediterranean countries declined.

Growth in the global seed and crop protection market last year was again driven by Latin America, par-
icularly Brazil.

In North America, the average growth rates of recent years were considerably exceeded in 2012 despite
he extreme summer drought, which particularly affected the Midwestern United States.

The generally positive market trend continued in 2012 in Asia/Pacific, too, although average growth for

he region was slightly down from the previous year. The Chinese and Indian crop protection markets
showed the strongest growth momentum.

MATERIALSCIENCE
The products of MaterialScience are mainly used in the automotive, construction, electrical/electronics
and furniture industries.

Despite worsening growth perspectives in Europe, these principal global customer industries for
MaterialScience developed satisfactorily overall in 2012. The progressive recovery in North America and
the stabilization of the Asian markets had an especially positive impact on our business development.

The global automotive industry again showed robust growth overall. New vehicle registrations world-
wide reached a record high in 2012. The drivers of this trend were sharply increased demand in the
Asian countries and the continuing very positive development in North America. Demand in Western
Europe was below the 2011 level, with a recovery not expected to begin before 2014 at the earliest.

The global construction industry grew at about the same rate in 2012 as in the prior year. Growth in the
major Asian countries was robust, though somewhat weaker than in 2011. The u.s. construction industry
failed to show a significant recovery, and the European debt crisis continued to dampen demand in
Western Europe.

The global electrical/electronics industry experienced solid growth in 2012 as a result of its broad
diversification. Demand for consumer electronics continued to increase, particularly in the BRIC coun-
tries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) in light of rising incomes. The sector registered positive growth
momentum in Western Europe thanks to the deployment of new technologies and innovative solutions
in response to climate change.

The development of the global furniture industry varied by region in 2012. While growth in Europe
slowed down as the eurozone economy clouded over, the North American furniture market showed sig-
nificant recovery potential. The Asian markets proved largely stable despite weaker growth rates.

FULL YEAR 2012

2012 was a very successful year for Bayer. We achieved our targets for the Group. Operationally, all of
our subgroups posted growth in sales and earnings before special items, with particularly strong mo-
mentum in the life-science businesses. We also made good progress strategically, continuing to develop
our innovation pipeline and bringing new products to market. We systematically strengthened our life-
science businesses through acquisitions and considerably expanded our business in the emerging
markets*. This makes us optimistic for 2013, in which we plan to grow sales and earnings once again.

EBIT of the Bayer Group declined by 4.6% to €3,960 million (2011: €4,149 million) after special items
of minus €1,711 million (2011: minus €876 million). The special items included €1,186 million in
charges related to legal claims concerning the oral contraceptives Yasmin™/yaz™. Of these charges,
€455 million were taken in the fourth quarter of 2012 and mainly related to further accounting mea-
sures for venous clot injury cases of which we are currently aware and anticipated future cases. Other
special charges were restructuring expenses of €396 million and impairment losses of €289 million on
intangible assets. Special gains from divestitures came to €158 million, while adjustments of benefit
entitlements resulted in gains of €114 million. EBIT before special items amounted to €5,671 million
(2011: €5,025 million). EBITDA before special items increased by 8.8% to €8,284 million (2011:
€7,613 million), driven by good business development and savings from the restructuring program
successfully completed in 2012. Earnings of all the subgroups were also boosted by positive currency
effects totaling about €400 million. HealthCare raised EBITDA before special items by 7.8% to

€5,068 million (2011: €4,702 million) due to positive business development in both segments. EBITDA
before special items of CropScience rose by a substantial 21.4% to €2,008 million (2011: €1,654 mil-
lion), largely as a result of higher volumes. EBITDA before special items of MaterialScience improved
by 6.8% to €1,251 million (2011: €1,171 million), mainly because of higher volumes.

Gross cash flow receded by 11.1% in 2012 to €4,599 million (2011: €5,172 million). Net cash flow fell
by 10.4% to €4,532 million (2011: €5,060 million). The increase in cash flows resulting from the im-
proved operating performance was more than offset by a business-related increase in cash tied up in
working capital and higher income tax payments. Net financial debt was level with December 31, 2011,
at €7.0 billion, including a €1.0 billion contribution to the pension fund in the fourth quarter of 2012.
The net amount recognized for post-employment benefits after deducting plan assets from the defined
benefit obligation rose by €1.5 billion to €9.3 billion, mainly because of lower long-term interest rates on
the capital market.
FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012

Group sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 rose by 5.5% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €9,862 million (report-
ed: +7.3%). Sales of HealthCare advanced by 5.1% (Fx § portfolio adj.) to €4,923 million (reported:
+7.1%). Those of the Pharmaceuticals segment increased by 4.8% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €2,867 mil-
lion (reported: +7.0%), mainly due to encouraging sales growth in North America and the emerging
economies, especially China. Business in the Consumer Health segment moved ahead by 5.4% (Fx &
portfolio adj.) to €2,056 million (reported: +7.4%), driven by higher sales of the Consumer Care Divi-
sion in all regions. CropScience sales increased by 9.1% (Fx & portfolio adj.) in the fourth quarter to
€1,856 million (reported: +10.7%) as a result of higher volumes. Sales of MaterialScience rose by
4.8% (Fx & portfolio adj.) against the prior-year quarter, to €2,761 million (reported: +6.4%), thanks
to volume and price increases.

EBIT of the Bayer Group climbed by 16.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012 to €735 million (Q4 2011:
€629 million). Earnings were diminished by special items of minus €424 million (Q4 2011: minus

€215 million), mainly comprising €543 million in accounting measures based on legal claims, €114 mil-
lion in restructuring expenses, €158 million in divestiture gains and €59 million in gains from adjust-
ments of benefit entitlements. EBIT before special items climbed by 37.3% to €1,159 million (Q4 2011:
€844 million).

EBITDA before special items of the Bayer Group increased in the fourth quarter of 2012 by 18.4% to
€1,825 million (Q4 2011: €1,541 million). HealthCare raised EBITDA before special items by 13.7% to
€1,342 million (Q4 2011: €1,180 million). EBITDA before special items of CropScience came in at

€289 million (Q4 2011: €273 million), up 5.9%. EBITDA before special items at MaterialScience climbed
by 140.6% compared with a weak prior-year quarter to €255 million (94 2011: €106 million).

After a financial result of minus €161 million (94 2011: minus €178 million), income before income taxes
was €574 million (Q4 2011: €451 million). After taxes and non-controlling interest, net income came in at
€374 million (Q4 2011: €397 million). Earnings per share were €0.45 (Q4 2011: €0.48). Core earnings per
share rose to €1.00 (Q4 2011: €0.97), calculated as explained in Chapter 7.3 “Core Earnings Per Share.”

Gross cash flow of the Bayer Group came in 24.8% below the prior-year quarter at €755 million

(Q4 2011: €1,004 million). Net cash flow fell by 21.6% to €903 million (Q4 2011: €1,152 million). This
cash flow development was mainly the result of higher tax payments and less working capital release.
Net financial debt rose by €0.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012 to €7.0 billion (September 30, 2012:
€6.8 billion), including a €1.0 billion contribution to the pension fund.

Sales of the HealthCare subgroup rose by 4.2% (Fx § portfolio adj.) in 2012 to €18,612 million (reported:
+8.4%), with both the Pharmaceuticals and the Consumer Health segments contributing to this growth.
Business developed especially well in the emerging markets and in North America.

EBIT of the HealthCare subgroup fell in 2012 by 32.5% to €2,154 million. This drop in earnings was
mainly due to special items of minus €1,582 million (2011: minus €176 million). EBIT before special
items rose by 11.0% to €3,736 million. EBITDA before special items increased by 7.8% to €5,068 million.
This was mainly attributable to the positive business development in both segments — especially as a
result of volume-related sales growth — and to currency effects.

Sales of the Pharmaceuticals segment in 2012 came in at €10,803 million, up 4.2% (Fx § portfolio
adj.) from the prior year. Growth was achieved mainly in North America and the emerging markets,
particularly China. There was no overall sales gain in Europe due to the adverse economic conditions
and a difficult health policy environment.

Our anticoagulant Xarelto™ contributed significantly to sales growth in the Pharmaceuticals segment.
Sales advanced strongly in all regions — particularly in Germany, the United States and Japan — following
further product launches and indication expansions. Business with our hormone-releasing intrauterine
device Mirena™ developed positively in all regions, especially in the United States due to higher vol-
umes. Sales of the blood-clotting product Kogenate™ advanced due to higher volumes that mainly re-
sulted from tender business in Australia. The growth in sales of our multiple sclerosis drug Betafer-
on™/Betaseron™ was mainly attributable to price increases in the United States, while sales in other
countries declined. Sales of the cancer drug Nexavar™ moved ahead, particularly in the United States
and China and helped by tender business in Latin America.

Sales of Aspirin™ Cardio to prevent heart attacks and of our oral diabetes treatment Glucobay™ rose
considerably, largely thanks to the steady expansion of our marketing activities in China. Sales of
Adalat™ to treat high blood pressure and coronary heart disease also rose strongly in China. However,
Adalat™ sales posted a slight overall decline on a currency-adjusted basis, mainly as a result of manda-
tory price reductions in Japan.

Sales of our erectile dysfunction treatment Levitra™ and the antibiotic Avalox™/Avelox™ were down,
particularly in the United States, for reasons that included the partial restructuring of distribution

for general medicine products. The decline for Avalox™/Avelox™ was partly offset by higher sales to

a major customer in Western Europe and business growth in China. Sales of the yaz™/Yasmin™/
Yasminelle™ line of oral contraceptives receded, primarily as a result of generic competition in Western
Europe, although business developed positively in the Asia/Pacific region.

Our Pharmaceuticals business was strengthened by initial sales of our cancer drug Stivarga™ (active in-
gredient: regorafenib) in the United States — 2012 sales: €32 million — and of Eylea™ (active ingredient:
aflibercept) to treat wet age-related macular degeneration — 2012 sales: €14 million.

In the Pharmaceuticals segment, EBIT fell by 43.3% in 2012, to €1,075 million, reflecting special items of
minus €1,223 million (2011: minus €145 million). These included €1,160 million in charges related to legal
claims concerning the oral contraceptives Yasmin™/YAz™. EBIT before special items advanced by 12.5% to
€2,298 million. EBITDA before special items increased by 7.8% to €3,203 million. Major contributors to
this growth in earnings were the volume-driven sales increase and positive currency effects. However,
earnings were diminished by higher expenditures for marketing new products, and for developing the
business in the emerging markets, especially China.

Sales of Aspirin™ (including Aspirin™ Complex) — including Aspirin™ Cardio, which is reflected in sales of the Pharmaceuticals segment — increased by 10.9% (Fx adj. +6.4%) in
2012 to €970 million (2011: €875 million). Total sales of this product in the fourth quarter of 2012 rose by 13.1% to €267 million (Q4 2011: €236 million), and by 11.0% ona
currency-adjusted basis.
Our Consumer Care Division achieved above-market sales growth of 5.6% (Fx § portfolio adj.) to
€3,853 million. The encouraging sales gains were mainly attributable to intensified marketing activities,
which boosted sales of products such as our Bepanthen™/Bepanthol™ skincare line, especially in Russia
and Brazil, and the antifungal Canesten™, particularly in Germany. The growth in sales of our analgesic
Aleve™/naproxen resulted mainly from higher volumes in the United States. Sales of our pain-reliever
Aspirin™ showed a small increase, largely as a result of new launches in the United States.

Sales of the Medical Care Division rose by 2.2% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €2,653 million. The positive
development of our Diabetes Care business — despite price and reimbursement pressure — contributed
substantially to this increase. Sales growth was primarily attributable to the Contour™ line of blood glu-
cose meters, which posted gains in all regions, mainly due to the launch of Contour™ Next. Sales of our
contrast agent and medical equipment business matched the prior year. In the area of contrast agents
for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we raised sales of Gadovist™/Gadavist™, particularly in the United
States. This increase was partly due to the switch from Magnevist™, sales of which steadily receded.

The Animal Health Division lifted sales by 4.2% (Fx s portfolio adj.) to €1,303 million. Business with
our Advantage™ line of flea, tick and worm control products developed particularly well in the United
States and Europe.

EBIT of the Consumer Health segment fell by 16.6% to €1,079 million, due especially to special items
of minus €359 million (2011: minus €31 million) that resulted chiefly from impairment losses on intan-
gible assets, including the Medrad company name and brand. EBIT before special items amounted

to €1,438 million (+8.5%). EBITDA before special items grew by 7.8% to €1,865 million, primarily as a
result of the volume-related increase in sales and positive currency effects. However, earnings were
held back by higher marketing expenses.

CropScience increased sales in 2012 by a substantial 12.4% (Fx § portfolio adj.) to €8,383 million
(reported: +15.5%) in an attractive market environment. This growth was due largely to good business
with new products in Crop Protection and rapidly expanding sales of Seeds. Environmental Science
also developed favorably. The realignment of our marketing and distribution activities and streamlining
of the product range contributed to the gratifying performance.

Sales at Crop Protection/Seeds climbed by 13.1% (Fx s portfolio adj.) in 2012, to €7,703 million.
Crop Protection posted double-digit growth rates in all business units. We especially benefited from the
expansion of the seed treatment products business (SeedGrowth) and a sharp rise in sales of new
products such as the insecticide Belt™ and the fungicide Fox™. Sales of our herbicides also showed a
pleasing improvement. Seeds registered positive development, also with double-digit growth in sales.

At Crop Protection, all regions contributed to the sales increase.

Sales in Europe rose by 8.4% (Fx adj.) to €2,350 million. Here we were particularly successful with
new products, which accounted for a considerably greater proportion of sales than in the prior year.
Thanks to favorable market conditions, we significantly raised sales of seed treatment products, espe-
cially in cereals. Business development was also supported by strong sales of insecticides and fungi-
cides. We saw good gains for herbicides, mainly in light of increased demand for products for fall
application in cereals.

Sales in North America rose by 19.2% (Fx adj.) to €1,327 million. This increase was mainly the result
of successful market penetration by our new products, a generally favorable market environment for
broad-acre crops and relatively high prices for agricultural commodities. We achieved particularly high
growth rates in the United States for herbicides and fungicides used in corn and cereals. The expansion
of business with insecticides was largely due to demand for our new products. Sales of seed treatment
products were driven by the successful expansion of our business with Poncho™/Votivo™, especially in
corn. In Canada, sales also developed positively, chiefly as a result of higher demand for our insecticides
and fungicides.

Sales in the Asia/Pacific region advanced by 8.6% (Fx adj.) to €1,164 million, mainly driven by our
seed treatment products and herbicides. Our fungicides and insecticides businesses also saw consider-
able growth in sales. Business in our most important markets, India and Japan, trended positively. We
attained the highest percentage sales growth in Australia, largely thanks to the increase in demand for
our newly launched herbicide Sakura™. In China, we achieved significant growth for both fungicides
and seed treatment products.

Sales in the Latin America/ Africa/Middle East region advanced by 13.8% (Fx adj.) to €1,899 million,
with a positive market environment leading to double-digit growth in all business units. In Latin
America, we continued to experience good growth for our insecticides in Brazil and Argentina and
scored a further improvement for seed treatment products (SeedGrowth). Sales of fungicides rose by a
double-digit percentage despite adverse weather conditions at the start of the year. The expansion in
our herbicides business was mainly due to gratifying sales gains for products used in corn and cotton
in Brazil. Sales in Africa, too, saw double-digit growth, while business in the Middle East was level with
the prior year.

Sales of the Seeds business unit climbed by 14.1% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €962 million. All regions
contributed to this performance, particularly North America. Sales in our core crops of oilseed
rape/canola, rice and cotton also grew by double-digit percentages. Business with our Nunhems™
vegetable seeds, however, was slightly below the previous year, partly because of adverse price devel-
opment for vegetables.

Sales of the Environmental Science business unit increased by 5.3% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €680 mil-
lion, with products both for professional users and consumers posting gains. The Latin America/Africa/
Middle East and North America regions developed positively, while Europe and Asia/Pacific came in at
the prior-year level.

!"#$ of CropScience rose significantly in 2012 from €562 million to €1,539 million, including net special
items of €13 million (2011: minus €606 million). The net special gain in 2012 contained the income
from the sale of a site in India, this being largely offset by provisions established in connection with

higher volumes and positive currency effects. Manufacturing costs grew more slowly than sales. In
addition, we incurred one-time gains of €52 million (2011: €38 million), mainly in connection with the
outlicensing or divestment of active ingredients in Crop Protection.

Sales of the MaterialScience subgroup rose in 2012 by 3.0% (Fx s portfolio adj.) to €11,503 million
(reported: +6.2%). This growth was mainly the result of an overall increase in volumes, which were flat
with the previous year in Europe but posted good gains in the other regions. In addition, we were able
to slightly raise prices in all regions except Asia/Pacific.

The Polyurethanes business unit raised sales by 7.9% (Fx § portfolio adj.) to €5,995 million. Contribut-
ing to this increase were higher volumes and prices in all product groups and regions. We achieved
significant volume and price increases, particularly for diphenylmethane diisocyanate (mp1) and toluene
diisocyanate (TDI).

The Polycarbonates business unit posted sales of €2,823 million, down 7.1% (Fx s portfolio adj.) year
on year. The decline was attributable to a drop in selling prices worldwide that was mainly due to new
production capacities. However, volumes as a whole were level year on year.
Sales in the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialties business unit moved forward by 3.5% (Fx & portfolio adj.)
to €1,972 million as a result of the higher overall volumes and prices we achieved in nearly all regions.

Industrial Operations reported sales of €713 million (Fx & portfolio adj. + 6.1%) thanks to higher selling
prices in North America and Europe. Volumes, however, were somewhat lower than in the prior year,
mainly because of declines in Asia/Pacific and North America.

EBIT of MaterialScience receded by 5.7% in 2012 to €597 million after net special charges of €32 mil-
lion (2011: special gain of €44 million). Restructuring charges of €50 million were partly offset by
gains from adjustments of benefit entitlements. EBIT before special items rose by 6.8% to €629 million.
EBITDA before special items advanced by 6.8% to €1,251 million. This increase was mainly the result
of higher volumes, savings from our efficiency improvement programs and positive currency effects.
By contrast, earnings were diminished by higher raw material and energy costs.

Sales of the Bayer Group advanced by 8.8% year on year to €39,760 million, mainly due to growth in
business at HealthCare and CropScience. Adjusted for currency and portfolio effects, the increase came
to 5.3%.

The cost of goods sold rose by 6.0% to €19,059 million, largely because of the increase in volumes and
higher raw material costs at MaterialScience. The ratio of the cost of goods sold to total sales was
47.9% (2011: 49.2%). Selling expenses increased by 11.5% to €9,987 million, amounting to 25.1% of
sales (2011: 24.5%). This increase was primarily due to higher selling expenses at HealthCare, mainly
for the marketing of new products. Research and development expenses, at €3,013 million, were 2.8%
above the prior year. The ratio of !"# expenses to sales was 7.6% (2011: 8.0%). General administration
expenses, at €1,866 million, exceeded the prior-year level by 8.9%. The ratio of general administration
expenses to total sales thus remained flat with the previous year at 4.7%. The considerably greater
negative balance of other operating income and expenses, at €1,875 million (2011: €801 million), re-

[7] SEE sulted mainly from higher special charges related to legal claims (see also Chapter 7.2 “Calculation of

CHAPTER 7:2 $%&#( ) Before Special Items”).

$%&Ueclined by 4.6% in 2012 to €3,960 million.
The financial result improved by 9.4% to minus €712 million. It included interest cost of €320 million
(2011: €336 million) for pension and other provisions, lower net interest expense of €252 million

(2011: €335 million), a net exchange loss of €69 million (2011: €53 million) and a net loss of €52 million
(2011: €45 million) from investments in affiliated companies. The improvement in the net interest posi-
tion was mainly due to the reduction in financial debt. The decrease in interest expense for pension and
other provisions resulted partly from the effect of lower interest rates on the interest cost for defined
benefit plans, which is reported net of the expected return on plan assets.

Tax expense in 2012 amounted to €752 million. Income after taxes came in at €2,496 million. The posi-
tive balance of income and losses attributable to non-controlling interest, at €50 million, was €48 million
higher than in the prior year, mainly on account of minority stockholders’ interest in divestiture gains.
Bayer Group net income for 2012 was €2,446 million.

7.2 Calculation of EBIT(DA) Before Special Items

Key performance indicators for the Bayer Group are $%&before special items and $%&’#(before special
items. These indicators are reported in order to allow a more accurate assessment of business opera-
tions. The special items — comprising effects that are non-recurring or do not regularly recur or attain
similar magnitudes — are detailed in the following table. $%&’#( $%&’#(before special items and $%&be-
fore special items are not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards and therefore
should only be regarded as supplementary information. The company considers $%&’#(before special
items to be a more suitable indicator of operating performance since it is not affected by depreciation,
amortization, impairments or special items. By reporting this indicator, the company aims to give read-
ers a clearer picture of the results of operations and ensure greater comparability of data over time. The
$%&’#(margin before special items, which is the ratio of $%&’#(before special items to sales, serves as a
relative indicator for the internal and external comparison of operational earning power.

Depreciation, amortization and impairments increased by 6.9% in 2012 to €2,960 million (2011: €2,769
million), comprising €1,637 million (2011: €1,425 million) in amortization and impairments of intangible
assets and €1,323 million (2011: €1,344 million) in depreciation and impairments of property, plant and
equipment. The impairments are reflected net of impairment loss reversals of €21 million (2011: €37 mil-
lion). A total of €347 million (2011: €181 million) in depreciation, amortization and impairments consti-
tuted special items. This amount comprised €315 million (2011: €216 million) in impairment losses and
€48 million (2011: €0 million) in depreciation and amortization, less €16 million (2011: €35 million) in
impairment loss reversals.

7.3 Core Earnings Per Share

Earnings per share according to &)!* are affected by the purchase price allocation for acquisitions and
other special factors. To enhance comparability, we also determine core net income after eliminating
amortization and impairments of intangible assets, impairments of property, plant and equipment, and
special items in $%&’#(including the related tax effects.

From this core net income we calculate core earnings per share in the same way as earnings per share.
Core earnings per share form the basis for our dividend policy. Core earnings per share in 2012 amount-
ed to €5.35 (2011: €4.83).

7.4 Value Management

CASH VALUE ADDED-BASED SYSTEM

One of the prime objectives of the Bayer Group is to sustainably increase enterprise value. We use a
Group-wide value management system to plan, control and monitor our businesses. An important value-
based indicator is the cash value added (+,( ), which shows the degree to which the cash flows needed to
cover the costs of equity and debt and of reproducing depletable assets have been generated. If the +,(

is positive, the respective company or business entity has exceeded the minimum requirements and has
created value. If it is negative, the anticipated capital and asset reproduction costs have not been earned.
The +,( is an indicator for a single reporting period. For a year-on-year comparison we therefore use
our second central steering parameter for value management, the delta +,( , which is the difference be-
tween the +,( s of two consecutive periods. If the delta+,(_ is positive, the company has created more
value than it did in the previous year.

The value-based indicators support management in its decision-making, especially in the areas of
strategic portfolio optimization and the allocation of resources for acquisitions and capital expendi-
tures. The focus at the operational level is on the key drivers of enterprise value: growth (sales), cost
efficiency ($%&’#¢ and capital efficiency (working capital, capital expenditures), since these directly
affect value creation.

CALCULATING THE COST OF CAPITAL

Bayer calculates the cost of capital according to the debt/equity ratio at the beginning of the year using
the weighted average cost of capital (-(++ ) formula. The cost of equity capital is the return expected by
stockholders, computed from capital market information. The cost of debt used in calculating -(++ is
based on the terms for ten-year Eurobonds issued by industrial companies with an “A-"rating.

To take into account the different risk and return profiles of our principal businesses, we calculate indi-
vidual capital cost factors after income taxes for each of our subgroups. In 2012 these were unchanged
from 2011 at 8.1% for HealthCare, 7.5% for CropScience and 7.1% for MaterialScience. The minimum
return required for the Group in 2012, as in 2011, was 7.8%.

GROSS CASH FLOW, CASH VALUE ADDED AND CASH FLOW RETURN ON INVESTMENT
AS PERFORMANCE YARDSTICKS

The gross cash flow as published in our statement of cash flows is the measure of our internal financing
capability. Bayer has chosen this parameter because it is relatively free of accounting influences and is
therefore a more meaningful performance indicator.

Taking into account the costs of capital and of reproducing depletable assets, we determine the gross
cash flow hurdle. If the gross cash flow hurdle is equaled or exceeded, the +,( is positive and thus the
required return on equity and debt plus the cost of asset reproduction has been earned.

The profitability of the Group and of its individual business entities is measured by the cash flow return
on investment (CFROI). In 2012 we changed the way the CFROI is calculated to allow a direct compari-
son to the weighted average cost of capital (-(++ ). The CFROI is now the difference between the gross
cash flow and the cost of reproducing depletable assets, divided by the capital invested. The capital in-
vested is calculated from the statement of financial position and basically comprises the property, plant
and equipment and intangible assets required for operations — stated at cost of acquisition or construc-
tion — plus working capital, less interest-free liabilities (such as current provisions). To mitigate the
effect of fluctuations in the capital invested during the year, the CFROI is computed on the basis of the
average capital invested for the respective year.

The gross cash flow hurdle for 2012 was €4,337 million (2011: €4,339 million).

Actual gross cash flow came in at €4,599 million, exceeding the hurdle by 6.0%. This means we earned
our entire capital and asset reproduction costs in 2012. The positive +,( of €262 million shows that
Bayer exceeded the minimum return and reproduction requirements and created value for the company
in addition. Since the +,( in 2011 was €833 million, the Bayer Group therefore recorded a delta+,(_ of
minus €571 million in 2012. The CFROI for 2012 amounted to 8.3% (2011: 9.7%).
HealthCare and CropScience exceeded their target returns, including asset reproduction, and helped
to increase the company’s value. At MaterialScience, investment in new production facilities forms the
basis for profitable growth in the future. These strategic capital expenditures are based on expected
medium- and long-term market developments and continued to have an adverse effect on the value
management data for MaterialScience.

non-cash components of EBIT. It also contains benefit payments during the year.

OPERATING CASH FLOW

Gross cash flow receded by 11.1% in 2012 to €4,599 million and net cash flow by 10.4% to €4,532
million, the increase in cash flows due to the improved operating performance being more than offset
by a business-related increase in cash tied up in working capital and higher income tax payments
(2012: €1,667 million; 2011: €932 million). In addition, the purchase of securities held for trading,
which must be reflected under operating activities according to &(*7, diminished net cash flow by
€200 million.
INVESTING CASH FLOW

Net cash outflow for investing activities in 2012 totaled €818 million. Cash outflows for property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets were 19.4% higher at €1,929 million. Of this amount, HealthCare ac-
counted for €721 million (2011: €608 million), CropScience for €376 million (2011: €280 million) and
MaterialScience for €620 million (2011: €565 million). Cash outflows for acquisitions, totaling €466 million
(2011: €261 million), related to the acquisition of the . .*. biological crop protection company AgraQuest,
Inc., the purchase of the watermelon and melon seed business of the . .*. company Abbott s Cobb, Inc.
and the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Baulé *.(.*., France. Among the cash inflows in 2012
were €178 million (2011: €173 million) in income from divestitures — mainly the sale of the hematological
oncology portfolio to Genzyme Corp., United States — and €104 million (2011: €75 million) in interest and
dividends received. Cash inflows from current and noncurrent financial assets totaled €1,068 million
(2011: €2,537 million outflows), mainly comprising proceeds from the sale of investments in money mar-
ket funds.

FINANCING CASH FLOW

Net cash outflow for financing activities in 2012 amounted to €3,782 million, including net loan repay-
ments of €1,945 million (2011: €397 million). Net interest payments were 17.9% lower at €468 million
(2011: €570 million). The cash outflow for “dividend payments and withholding tax on dividends”
amounted to €1,366 million (2011: €1,242 million).

Net financial debt of the Bayer Group as of December 31, 2012 was level with December 31, 2011, at
€7.0 billion. Cash inflows from operating activities were offset by outflows for dividends, the allocations
to pension funds, and acquisitions. As of December 31, 2012, the Group had cash and cash equivalents
of €1.7 billion (2011: €1.8 billion). Financial liabilities at the end of the reporting period amounted to
€9.1 billion (2011: €11.3 billion), with the subordinated hybrid bond issued in July 2005 reflected at €1.4
billion. Net financial debt should be viewed against the fact that Moody’s and Standard s Poor's treat
75% and 50%, respectively, of the hybrid bond as equity. Unlike conventional borrowings, the hybrid
bond thus only has a limited effect on the Group’s rating-specific debt indicators. Our noncurrent finan-
cial liabilities declined in 2012 from €8.0 billion to €7.0 billion, while current financial liabilities declined
from €3.7 billion to €2.6 billion.

Total assets declined in 2012 by 2.7% to €51.3 billion. Noncurrent assets declined by €0.3 billion to
€32.4 billion, mainly due to amortization and impairments of intangible assets. Noncurrent assets in-
cluded goodwill of €9.3 billion (2011: €9.2 billion), the increase being mainly due to acquisitions, but
were diminished by currency effects. Current assets declined by €1.0 billion compared with the previous
year, to €19.0 billion, mainly because of the lower liquidity resulting from the redemption of several
bonds at maturity. This was partially offset by the business-related growth in inventories and trade ac-
counts receivable.

Equity was lower by €0.7 billion at €18.6 billion. The factors here included the €2.0 billion increase —
recognized outside profit or loss — in post-employment benefit obligations and the dividend payment of
€1.4 billion (2011: €1.2 billion), with the €2.4 billion net income having an offsetting effect. Our equity
ratio (equity coverage of total assets) was 36.2% as of December 31, 2012 (2011: 36.5%).

Liabilities fell by €0.7 billion compared with December 31, 2011, to €32.8 billion, mainly due to the re-
demption of several bonds. This factor was partly offset by the increase in the net amount recognized for
post-employment benefits and the allocations to provisions for legal claims.

The net amount recognized for post-employment benefits increased from €7.8 billion to €9.3 billion
in 2012, due especially to lower long-term capital market interest rates. This includes a €1.0 billion
allocation made to our pension funds in 2012.

7.7 Financial Strategy

The financial management of the Bayer Group is conducted by the strategic management holding
company Bayer AG. Capital is a global resource, generally procured centrally and distributed within the
Group. The foremost objectives of our financial management are to help bring about a sustained in-
crease in corporate value and to ensure the Group’s liquidity and creditworthiness. This involves opti-
mizing the capital structure and effectively managing risks. The management of currency, interest rate,
raw material price and default risks helps to reduce the volatility of our earnings.

The contracted rating agencies assess Bayer as follows:

Rating [Table 3.25]
Long-term rating Outlook Short-term rating

Standard & Poor's A- positive A-2

Moody’s A3 stable P-2

These credit ratings reflect the company’s high solvency and ensure access to a broad investor base for
financing purposes. It remains our goal to achieve and maintain financial ratios that support an A rating in
order to maintain our financial flexibility. Accordingly, we plan to use part of our operating cash flows to
reduce net financial debt.

We pursue a prudent debt management strategy to ensure flexibility, drawing on a balanced financing
portfolio. Chief among these resources are a multi-currency European Medium Term Notes program, syn-
dicated credit facilities, bilateral loan agreements and a global commercial paper program.

We use financial derivatives to hedge against risks arising from business operations or financial transac-
tions, but do not employ contracts in the absence of an underlying transaction. It is our policy to diminish
default risks by selecting trading partners with a high credit standing. We closely monitor the execution
of all transactions, which are conducted in accordance with Group directives.

Further details of our risk management objectives and the ways in which we account for all the major types
of hedged transactions — along with price, credit and liquidity risks as they relate to the use of financial in-
struments — are given in Chapter 16.1 “Opportunity and Risk Report.”
8. Earnings; Asset and Financial Position
of Bayer AG

Bayer AG is the parent corporation of the Bayer Group and functions as a management holding company. The
principal management functions for the entire Group are performed by the Board of Management of Bayer
AG. These include strategic planning, resource allocation, executive management and financial management.
The performance of Bayer AG is largely determined by the business performance of the Bayer Group.

The financial statements of Bayer AG are prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code
(!"# ) and Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

8.1 Earnings Performance of Bayer AG

Bayer AG Summary Income Statements according to the German Commercial Code [Table 3.26]

Net income 1,125 889

Distributable profit 1,364 1,571

In fiscal 2012 Bayer AG’s net income declined 21% to €889 million (2011: €1,125 million), mainly
because of lower income from investments in affiliated companies. However, reductions in net interest
expense and income taxes had a positive effect.

The €419 million drop in income from affiliated companies to €1,719 million (-20%) was principally at-
tributable to a decrease of about €400 million in income from subsidiaries with which Bayer AG has profit
and loss transfer agreements. This item is also impacted by a one-time charge of €256 million in connec-
tion with the assumption by various subsidiaries of the pension fund’s statutory obligation to raise pen-
sions. In 2011, however, the income from Bayer Pharma AG had been diminished by a one-time charge of
€268 million resulting from the transfer of pension obligations to Bayer Altersversorgung GmbH. The
main reasons for the drop in income from subsidiaries with profit and loss transfer agreements were sig-
nificantly lower income from Bayer MaterialScience AG and the absence of income from Bayer Animal
Health GmbH following the termination of its profit and loss transfer agreement with Bayer AG in 2011.
As in the previous year, Bayer Pharma AG contributed the largest share of income from subsidiaries with
profit and loss transfer agreements, at €1,397 million compared with €1,170 million in 2011. The non-re-
currence of the €268 million one-time charge taken in 2011 benefited this subsidiary’s income for 2012.
However, earnings were diminished by a provision of €102 million for impending losses on transactions
with intra-Group customers. Bayer CropScience AG contributed €446 million to Bayer AG's income (2011:
€551 million). This amount included provisions of about €72 million established for impending losses on
transactions with other Group companies. A loss of €179 million was transferred from Bayer Material-
Science AG, compared with income of €95 million in the previous year. The €274 million drop in this sub-
sidiary’s income was mainly attributable to business operations. Other significant earnings contributions
comprised €291 million from a subsidiary that receives foreign dividend income.

Net interest expense was €445 million (2011: €5389 million), down by €144 million compared with 2011.

The main reason for the imnraved net interest nasitinn was the dron in interest rates with the decrease
Other financial income and expenses yielded a positive balance of €89 million (2011: €116 million).
This mainly comprised income of €183 million (2011: €121 million) from the subgroups and service
companies to cover pension expenses for retirees remaining with Bayer AG following the hive-down of
the operating business. Most of the corresponding expense is reflected in net interest expense. Bayer
AG's income was reduced by €56 million as the result of the assumption of an obligation to raise the
pensions paid by the pension fund. A further charge of €33 million resulted from the translation of for-
eign currency receivables and payables and from currency derivatives.

The balance of miscellaneous operating income and expenses relating to Bayer AG’s performance of its
functions as a holding company was minus €19 million (2011: minus €10 million), while general admin-
istration expenses amounted to €228 million (2011: €195 million).

Pre-tax income decreased by €344 million to €1,116 million. Tax expense dropped from €335 million
to €227 million. After deduction of taxes, net income was €889 million (2011: €1,125 million). Including
a €682 million withdrawal from retained earnings, the distributable profit amounted to €1,571 million.

The Board of Management and Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting

on April 26, 2013 that the distributable profit be used to pay a dividend of €1.90 per share (826,947,808
shares) on the capital stock of €2,117 million entitled to the dividend for 2012.

Total equity and liabilities 38,370 36,022
The asset and liability structure of Bayer AG is dominated by its role as a holding company in managing
the subsidiaries and financing corporate activities. This is primarily reflected in the high level of invest-
ments in affiliated companies and of receivables from, and payables to, Group companies.

Total assets of Bayer AG were €36.0 billion (2011: €38.4 billion), which was €2.4 billion less than at the
start of the year. Current assets declined by €1.7 billion while noncurrent assets shrank by €0.7 billion.

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets totaled €22 million and were therefore of second-
ary importance in relation to total assets. Financial assets declined by €0.7 billion from the previous
year to €34.3 billion, principally as a result of the transfer of subsidiaries to other Group companies.
This amount includes investments in affiliated companies of €33.5 billion (2011: €34.3 billion), account-
ing for 93.0% (2011: €89.3%) of total assets.

Receivables from subsidiaries amounted to €0.3 billion (2011: €0.5 billion) while payables to subsidiar-
ies totaled €15.9 billion (2011: €15.0 billion). These amounts accounted for 0.9% of total assets and
44.0% of total equity and liabilities, respectively.

Receivables from medium-term investments with banks, which are reflected in other receivables,
declined by €1.3 billion, as they were used to redeem a bond.

Equity showed a slight decline of €475 million because the dividend payment of €1,364 million for
2011 was not fully covered by the net income of €889 million in 2012. Equity totaled €13.9 billion at the
end of 2012 (2011: €14.4 billion). Despite the decline, the equity ratio rose slightly from 37.4% to
38.6% because of the drop in total assets.

Provisions declined by €0.7 billion to €2.7 billion. Of the decrease, €0.5 billion of the decline related to
provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits. One of the factors here was the transfer of
additional funds to Bayer Pension Trust to cover pension obligations. This reduced the net liability after
deducting plan assets. Tax payments made reduced tax provisions by €108 million. There was also a
fall in other provisions, mainly because of lower currency translation risks.

Other liabilities decreased by €1.2 billion, mainly due to a reduction in financial debt, and amounted to

€19.4 billion (net of deductible receivables; 2011: €20.6 billion). The €1.5 billion reduction in financial
debt to €20.8 billion (2011: €22.3 billion) was largely attributable to the redemption of a €2.0 billion
bond at maturity. Intra-Group debt increased by €0.5 billion. Net debt was lower than in the previous
year at €19.9 billion (2011: €21.1 billion).
Benefits from the
production network

9. Procurement and Production

In 2012, purchase orders for goods and services worth a total of approximately €18.1 billion from some
101,000 suppliers in 125 countries were recorded in the central ordering system. To meet specific re-
quirements as fully as possible, each subgroup procures direct materials itself. Indirect goods and ser-
vices not relevant for production, however, are sourced by our service companies or the unit with the
largest requirements using center-led strategies.

We endeavor to act responsibly along the entire supply chain, and sustainability considerations are in-
tegrated into our procurement processes throughout the Group. These include sourcing criteria such as
regulatory compliance, supply assurance, risk management, quality adherence and cost reduction. The
Bayer Supplier Code of Conduct, which sets out our sustainability requirements and is aligned to the
principles of the $% Global Compact, forms the basis for our work with suppliers. This code of conduct
is an established part of our supplier selection and evaluation process and is contractually integrated
into ordering systems and agreements throughout the Group. We verify our suppliers’ adherence to the
code of conduct by way of supplier evaluations and audits. In 2012 we carried out web-based supplier
evaluations and external audits. In addition, Bayer auditors performed supplier audits focused on !&’
(health, safety, environment) aspects. The results are analyzed in detail and documented. In the event
of any shortcomings, action plans are developed in conjunction with the suppliers concerned to im-
prove their social and/or environmental standards.

HEALTHCARE

The Product Supply unit of HealthCare steers the subgroup’s entire supply chain, from raw material
procurement to manufacturing to product shipment, utilizing a global production network consisting of
its own sites and those of subcontractors. In this way we aim to steadily reduce costs, increase our flexi-
bility and delivery reliability, and meet the globally high demands in terms of quality, health, safety and
environmental protection. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products is subject to extraordinarily
stringent quality standards. These standards are known collectively as “Good Manufacturing Practices”
("Q. ). Compliance with these requirements is regularly audited by internal experts, regulatory authori-
ties and external consultants.

The Pharmaceuticals segment generally procures the starting materials for the active ingredients of
its prescription pharmaceuticals from external suppliers. To prevent supply bottlenecks and mitigate
major price fluctuations, these starting materials and the intermediates we do not produce ourselves
are generally purchased under global contracts and/or from a number of suppliers we have audited
and approved.

Our active ingredients for prescription medicines are manufactured primarily at the sites in Wuppertal
and Bergkamen, Germany, and Berkeley and Emeryville, California, United States. These substances are
processed into finished products and packaged worldwide. Our medicines come in a wide range of de-
livery forms including solids such as tablets, coated tablets or powders; semi-solids such as ointments
or creams; and liquid pharmaceuticals such as those used in injections or infusions. Our hormonal
contraceptives are supplied as sugar- or film-coated tablets or used in intrauterine systems (coils), for
example. These formulating and packaging activities take place in Berlin, Leverkusen and Weimar,
Germany; Garbagnate, Italy; Beijing, China; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Turku, Finland. The hemophilia drug
Kogenate™ is manufactured by a biotechnological process at Berkeley, California, United States.
Betaferon™/Betaseron™ for the treatment of multiple sclerosis is produced in Emeryville, California.

For the Consumer Care Division of the Consumer Health segment we produce certain active substances,
such as acetylsalicylic acid and clotrimazole, within the Bayer Group in La Felguera, Spain. The principal
raw materials we purchase from third parties are naproxen, citric acid, ascorbic acid and other vitamins,
and paracetamol. To minimize business risks, we diversify our raw material procurement sources world-
wide and conclude long-term supply agreements. Among the division’s production sites are the facilities
in Myerstown, Pennsylvania, United States; Cimanggis, Indonesia; Lerma, Mexico; Bitterfeld-Wolfen and
Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany; and Madrid, Spain.
The Diabetes Care products (such as blood glucose meters) of our Medical Care division are mainly pro-
cured from original equipment manufacturers (*’( s). Material prices and availability are covered in
most cases by long-term contracts and therefore are not subject to major fluctuations. We hold strategic
reserves of certain materials and finished products so that we can supply our customers consistently and
reliably. Our contrast agents for diagnostic imaging procedures are produced mainly in Berlin, Germany.
Medical devices such as contrast agent injectors and mechanical systems for treating constricted or
blocked blood vessels are manufactured at the $.& sites near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and at Coon Rap-
ids, Minnesota. Most of the materials and components needed to manufacture our medical devices are
procured from external suppliers. The availability, quality and price stability of the materials are ensured
by way of long-term agreements, careful choice of suppliers and active supplier management.

The Animal Health Division procures the pharmaceutical active ingredients for its veterinary medicines
both from within the Bayer Group and from external suppliers throughout the world. Our animal health
products are manufactured mainly at the sites in Kiel, Germany, and Shawnee, Kansas, United States,
and marketed worldwide.

CROPSCIENCE

CropScience, too, manages procurement and production as a single organizational unit. This enables an
integrated supply chain from raw material purchase through end-product manufacture to warehousing,
followed by a two- or three-step distribution system depending on local market conditions. Unitary man-
agement is also intended to help us steadily improve our cost structures, increase our flexibility, ensure
a swifter response to market volatility and meet our high quality and safety standards.

In line with our strategy and in support of the volume growth in our business, we further optimized our
procurement structures in 2012. The principal procurement countries, representing the bulk of our pro-
curement volume, are now centrally managed. With this realigned organizational structure, we aim to
operate more efficiently in procurement markets and optimize our cost position. In addition, we mainly
procure supplies of important raw materials on the basis of long-term supply agreements to minimize
procurement risks such as supply shortages or substantial price fluctuations. Regular sustainability and
quality audits of our suppliers ensure compliance with internal and external standards.

Crop Protection and Environmental Science products are mainly manufactured at our own production
sites and formulating facilities. Among the largest are the facilities in Dormagen, Knapsack and Frank-
furt am Main, Germany; Kansas City, Missouri, United States; and Vapi, India. Our network of decentral-
ized formulation and filling sites enables us to respond rapidly to local market needs. At these sites the
active ingredients are processed into herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, seed treatment products and
Environmental Science products according to local requirements and application areas. Packaging of the
products also takes place in these facilities.

Production in the Seeds business unit takes place at locations close to our customers in Europe, Asia,
and North and South America at our own farms or under contract.

Investment in our global production network is continuing in order to create capacities for new products
and technologies and to improve manufacturing processes. We are significantly increasing our overall
level of capital investment to meet the steadily rising demand in a competitive and timely manner, and
plan to invest some €2 billion between 2011 and 2016. We had already made capital expenditures of
about €500 million by the end of 2012.

MATERIALSCIENCE

Procurement in the MaterialScience subgroup is globally steered by the Procurement s Trading unit.
Worldwide procurement and trading processes are centrally managed to leverage synergies within
MaterialScience. We aim to procure raw materials, energies and services in the market on the best pos-
sible terms by optimizing procurement structures and processes.

Key raw materials for our MaterialScience products are petrochemical feedstocks such as benzene,
toluene and phenol. We purchase these materials on the procurement markets, mainly under long-term
contracts. The operation of our production facilities also requires large amounts of energy, mostly in the
form of electricity or steam. In steam and electricity generation, we aim for a balanced diversification of
fuels and a mix of external procurement and captive production to minimize the price fluctuation risk.

The principal production facilities of MaterialScience are at Dormagen, Krefeld and Leverkusen,
Germany; Shanghai, China; and Baytown, Texas, United States. These supply all the subgroup’s busi-
ness units and are centrally managed by the Industrial Operations unit. Further major production sites
are located at Antwerp, Belgium; Brunsbittel, Germany; Map Ta Phut, Thailand; and Tarragona, Spain.
Each of these sites is managed by the respective business unit.

In the field of commodities we endeavor to reduce costs by operating high-capacity production facilities
that enable us to supply our markets on an international basis. We maintain a relatively large number of
production facilities in selected countries to serve our differentiated businesses. These facilities include
the “systems houses,” where we formulate and supply customized polyurethane systems, and plants
where we compound polycarbonate granules to meet specific customer requirements or manufacture
semi-finished products (polycarbonate sheets). We also operate regional production facilities for func-
tional films made of polycarbonate or thermoplastic polyurethane.

10. Products, Distribution and Markets

Marketing activities within the Bayer Group are decentralized due to the diversified business portfolio.

HEALTHCARE

Our Pharmaceuticals segment supplies prescription products. We offer cardiology drugs such as the
anticoagulant Xarelto™ (rivaroxaban), Aspirin™ Cardio to protect against heart attacks, and Adalat™ to
treat high blood pressure and coronary heart disease. The portfolio also includes women’s healthcare

11. Research, Development, Innovation

€ 3 e O billion Research and development expenses

° €2.0 billion at HealthCare
° €0.8 billion at CropScience
° €0.2 billion at MaterialScience

Innovation is the key driver of Bayer’s future growth. That is why Bayer focuses on research and devel-
opment. In 2012 a total of €3,013 million (2011: €2,932 million) was spent on research and develop-
ment. This was equivalent to 7.6% (2011: 8.0%) of sales. The number of employees working in re-
search and development worldwide was 12,900.

The importance of global networking and collaboration — both among the units of our enterprise and
with external companies and organizations — is steadily increasing. Our life-science areas of HealthCare
and CropScience therefore work particularly closely together. We expect common research projects
and the joint use of technology platforms to stimulate innovations for the improvement of human, ani-
mal and plant health. In addition, research projects with external partners from science and industry
form a key component of our innovation strategy. These collaborations and alliances with leading
universities, public research institutions and partner companies are supplemented by crowdsourcing,
incubators like the CoLaborator™ in the United States, and science hubs in emerging regions such

as Asia to tap into external innovative potential using the open innovation approach.

With strong and efficient research and development, an international network of partners and our focus

on growth areas and markets, we are laying the foundations for Bayer’s future success. Our activities
are centered on our customers’ needs — true to our mission “Bayer: Science For A Better Life.”

HEALTHCARE

In 2012 we invested €1,962 million (2011: €1,948 million) in research and development in the Pharma-
ceuticals and Consumer Health segments. This amounted to 65.1% of the Bayer Group’s entire re-
search and development spending and was equivalent to 10.5% (2011: 11.3%) of HealthCare sales. At
the end of 2012, some 7,500 employees of the HealthCare subgroup were working in research and
development.

Research and development expenses in the Pharmaceuticals segment amounted to €1,566 million
(2011: €1,556 million), or 14.5% (2011: 15.6%) of segment sales. Our research and development
outlay underscores our focus on growth through innovation. Drug discovery in the Pharmaceuticals
segment is concentrated in the areas of cardiology and oncology, along with gynecological treatments
and hematology. Other areas of focus are the therapeutic areas of inflammation and ophthalmology. In
addition, we are strengthening our established products through life-cycle management, an example
being the development of innovative forms of administration for contraceptives.

Research activities and capacities are bundled in Germany at the sites in Berlin and Wuppertal, and
in the United States in the Mission Bay neighborhood of San Francisco and at Berkeley, California.
Work in Berlin and Wuppertal mainly focuses on the discovery, optimization and development of
new active substances. Research is also carried out at these sites in the fields of drug metabolism,
pharmacokinetics, toxicology and clinical pharmacology. Our research and development activities in
Mission Bay and Berkeley are concentrated on biologicals and hematology. We also operate an inno-
vation center in Beijing, China.

We conducted clinical studies with several drug candidates from our research and development pipe-
line during 2012 to drive the development of new substances to treat diseases with a high unmet medi-
cal need. Following the completion of the required studies with a number of these drug candidates, we
submitted applications to one or more regulatory agencies for approvals or approval extensions.

Four active ingredients/ products have blockbuster potential. Of special importance is our anticoagulant
Xarelto™ (rivaroxaban), which continues to be launched in more countries. In 2012 we filed for, and in
some cases already received, marketing authorization in additional indications. In the area of oncology,
regorafenib (registered in the United States under the trademark Stivarga™) is approved for the treat-
ment of advanced colorectal cancer in some countries, and approval is pending in others. At the end of
2012, we filed for marketing authorization for radium-223 dichloride (Alpharadin) for the therapy of
bone metastases in prostate cancer patients. Other promising products being launched include Eylea™
(aflibercept) for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration.

The nature of drug discovery and development is such that not all compounds can be expected to meet the pre-defined project goals. It is possible that any
or all of the projects listed above may have to be discontinued due to scientific and/or commercial reasons and will not result in commercialized products.

It is also possible that the requisite Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) or other regulatory approvals will not be
granted for these compounds.

We regularly evaluate our research and development pipeline in order to prioritize the most promising
pharmaceutical projects.

Xarelto™ (active ingredient: rivaroxaban) has been used since 2008 for prophylaxis of venous throm-
boembolism ("#$) in adult patients following elective hip or knee replacement surgery. Xarelto™ is
registered in more than 120 countries around the world and marketed in this indication by HealthCare
outside the United States. In 2011, Xarelto™ was also approved in the European Union for stroke pre-
vention in patients with atrial fibrillation as well as for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (%"#
and the prevention of recurring %"#and pulmonary embolism following acute %"#in adult patients. In
Japan, Xarelto™ was approved in January 2012 for prophylaxis of stroke and systemic embolism in
patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Market introduction began in April 2012.
Xarelto™ approved
in further indications

In the United States, where Xarelto™ has been approved since 2011 for "#$ prevention in adult patients
following elective hip or knee joint replacement surgery and to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with
non-valvular atrial fibrillation, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., United States — a subsidiary of Johnson s
Johnson — holds the commercialization rights for Xarelto™. Bayer HealthCare supports the sales team of
Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in selected hospitals and specialty markets in the United States.

Based on the successful $!&’#$!&($ study, we submitted an application to the European Medicines
Agency ($)* ) in April 2012 for marketing authorization of Xarelto™ in the treatment of pulmonary em-
bolism and the secondary prevention of recurrent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. We
were granted marketing authorization in November 2012. In May 2012, our cooperation partner Janssen
Research s Development, ++,, United States, submitted applications to the - .’. Food and Drug Admi-
nistration (.%*) seeking approval for Xarelto™ in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary
embolism and in secondary prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism ("#$). In November 2012,
the .%* granted marketing authority for these applications following a priority review.

In December 2011, we submitted an application to the $)* for marketing authorization for Xarelto™
(rivaroxaban) in secondary prevention following acute coronary syndrome (*,’ ). The application for
marketing approval in this indication in the - .’. was submitted to the .%* by our cooperation partner
Janssen Research s Development, ++,. In June 2012, we received a Complete Response Letter from the
.%* regarding the *,’ indication. The requested information was submitted in September 2012 by our
cooperation partner Janssen Research s Development, ++,. The application for Xarelto™ in the preven-
tion of stent thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome was submitted at the same time. The
European application for marketing authorization for secondary prevention after acute coronary syn-
drome also includes prevention of stent thrombosis.

Riociguat is the first member of a new class of vasodilating agents known as soluble guanylate cyclase
(sGC) stimulators. Administered in tablet form, riociguat is currently being investigated as a new ap-
proach for the treatment of various forms of pulmonary hypertension. The registration-relevant Phase !!!
J/$# -1 and (*#$&#-1 studies each reached their primary endpoints in October 2012. In both studies,
the substance demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in physical fitness among patients
with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (,#$(/_) or pulmonary arterial hypertension ((*/ )
compared with placebo. Based on these studies, we submitted riociguat in February 2013 for marketing
approval in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of #$(/ and (*/ .

Regorafenib is a novel, oral multi-kinase inhibitor that inhibits various signaling pathways responsible
for tumor growth. In 2012, we submitted regorafenib for marketing authorization in the treatment of pa-
tients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in the United States, Europe and Japan. The registration
applications are based on the results of the worldwide Phase !!! ,011$,# study. In September 2012,
regorafenib was approved in this indication by the - .’. .%* under the trade name Stivarga™. The Japa-
nese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare ()/+2 ) granted priority review status for this substance.

In April 2012, regorafenib reached the primary endpoint — statistically significant extension of progres-
sion-free survival — in the Phase !!!31!%clinical trial. The 31!%trial investigated regorafenib in the
treatment of patients with metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors (3!’#) whose
disease had progressed despite prior treatment with imatinib and sunitinib. In August 2012, the sub-
stance was submitted for approval in the treatment of 3!’# in the United States. In October 2012, the -.’.
Food and Drug Administration (.%*) granted priority review status to the application. In December 2012,
an application for registration was filed with the Japanese )/+2
In 2011, we signed an agreement with Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., United States, under which Onyx will
receive a royalty on any future global sales of regorafenib in oncology.

In a registration-relevant Phase !!! study (*+'4)(,* _), radium-223 dichloride (Alpharadin) — the cancer
drug we are jointly developing with Algeta *’* , Norway — demonstrated a significant improvement in
overall survival in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (,1(, ) and bone metastases. Based
on these positive results, we filed registration applications with the - .’. Food and Drug Administration
(.%*) and the European Medicines Agency ($)* ) for radium-223 dichloride for the treatment of ,1(, in
December 2012.

Eylea™ (active ingredient: aflibercept) is our joint developmental project with Regeneron Pharmaceuti-
cals, Inc., United States. Aflibercept blocks the natural growth factor "$3. (vascular endothelial growth
factor), thus preventing the abnormal formation of new blood vessels that tend to leak blood. The medi-
cation is administered directly into the eye. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals holds exclusive rights in the
United States, where Eylea™ has been approved since 2011 for the treatment of wet age-related macu-
lar degeneration (*)% ). Bayer will market the product outside the United States. In 2012, Eylea™ was
approved in various countries, including Japan, Australia and certain Latin American countries, for the
treatment of wet *)% . In November 2012, the European Commission granted marketing authorization.
The market introduction of Eylea™ in Australia, Japan and Europe began in November 2012.

In September 2012, based on the successful Phase !!! ,0($1&!,-" and 3*+!+$0 studies, our cooperation
partner Regeneron received an approval extension for Eylea™ in the United States for the treatment of
macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion (,1"0 ). In December 2012, we filed with the
European Medicines Agency ($)* ) for marketing authorization in this indication. In January 2013, a reg-
istration application was filed with the Japanese )/+2

In addition to the wet *)% indication, further Phase !!! studies are currently ongoing with aflibercept
for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (%)$ ) and choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) caused by
severe myopia.

Our cooperation partner Genzyme Corp., United States, has applied for marketing authorization for the
humanized monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab under the trade name Lemtrada™ for the treatment of
multiple sclerosis. The relevant approval submissions were made in the European Union and the United
States in the second quarter of 2012. We will share in the future success of Lemtrada™ through possible
royalty payments, milestone payments and global co-promotion.

In July 2012, we launched an international Phase !!! trial to evaluate the investigational compound 5*4
94-9027 for the treatment of hemophilia A. The (10#$,# "!!! trial is designed to investigate whether the
recombinant coagulation factor "!!! (rFVII) !"#$% -$&’( can prolong the duration of protection from
bleeding when used prophylactically, while also having the ability to treat acute bleeding events. This
could mean less frequent infusions for patients.

In the area of women’s healthcare, we are conducting research into gynecological therapies and addi-
tional contraception options. FC-Patch Low (ethinylestradiol/gestodene) is intended to become the
only transparent product of its kind and the smallest, lowest-dosed contraceptive patch on the market.

In September 2012, we applied for marketing authorization for this product in the European Union. In
December 2012, the European registration process for our new, low-dose hormone-releasing intrauter-
ine device +,’ -12 was successfully concluded. This device is smaller than Mirena™ and has a duration of
Life-cycle
management for
products already on
the market

use of up to three years. We plan to market this new contraceptive coil in the European Union under the
brand name “Jaydess.” In January 2013, +,’ -12 received approval in the United States under the trade-
mark Skyla™. A further, also small hormone-releasing device ()*+-16), with a duration of use of up to
five years, is currently in Phase !!! clinical development. In October 2012, the European Commission
authorized the approval of our new low-dose combined oral contraceptive Flexyess™ (drospirenone/
ethinylestradiol). The flexible extended regimen enables users to choose the number and timing of their
periods according to their needs. First launches of the product are expected in the second half of 2013.

We also invest in continuous life-cycle management to identify possible additional indications and
improved delivery forms for products already on the market. For example, the additional indication
for our oral contraceptive Qlaira™/Natazia™ — treatment of heavy and/or prolonged menstrual bleed-
ing not caused by any diagnosed conditions of the uterus — was approved in the United States in
March 2012.

Another example is our cancer drug Nexavar™ (active ingredient: sorafenib), which we are continuing
to develop jointly with Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., United States. The successful active substance
sorafenib, which attacks both cancer cells and the vascular system of the tumor, has been registered
for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma since 2005 and for hepatocellular carcinoma since
2007. We plan to develop the product beyond these two therapeutic areas with a broadly based life-
cycle management program. In January 2013, a Phase !!! clinical trial investigating sorafenib as a
monotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic radioactive iodine (1*!)-refractory differ-
entiated thyroid cancer met its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in progres-
sion-free survival. Based on these data, we plan to apply for marketing authorization for sorafenib in
the treatment of 1*!-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Sorafenib is also being investigated in
Phase !!! registration studies as an adjuvant therapy following curative tumor resection in patients
with renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. We are also conducting Phase !!! studies in
breast cancer. Two Phase !!! clinical trials with sorafenib did not show the desired results: a study in
patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer whose disease had progressed after two or three
previous treatments and a combination study with sorafenib and erlotinib in liver cancer did not meet
their primary endpoints.

Research and development expenditures in the Consumer Health segment amounted to €396 million
(2011: €392 million), or 5.1% (2011: 5.4%) of segment sales.

In our Consumer Care Division, research and development activities at the product development
centers in Morristown, New Jersey, United States, and Gaillard, France, focus on developing non-pre-
scription (over-the-counter = 0#, ) products, medical skincare products and nutritional supplements to
market maturity. These activities center on supporting both existing and new brands. Aligned to end
consumers, our development strategies are geared toward expanding and improving our brand portfolio
through new products, packaging and delivery forms using the latest technologies. We also work to
achieve reclassification of current prescription medicines as 0#, products. We introduced a number of
new product line extensions to various markets in 2012. They included new delivery forms and uses for
existing brands such as Canesten™, Bepanthen™/Bepanthol™ and Alka-Seltzer Plus™.
The research and development activities of our Medical Care Division focus on blood glucose moni-
toring and the continuing development of contrast agents and medical equipment used in the diagno-
sis or treatment of various diseases.

At the four - .’. research and development locations for our diabetes care business, the largest of which
is in Tarrytown, New York, we are working to strengthen our product lines and continue expanding into
attractive segments of the diabetes market. We made further progress in 2012 with the launch of several
innovative products in key markets to meet the specific needs of people with diabetes. Examples include
the next generation of Contour™ 6# (Contour™ Next $7 in the - .’.) and Contour™ Next -’5 blood glu-
cose meters and the new Contour™ Next sensors, which demonstrate superior accuracy compared to
competitive systems.

The aim of our research and development activities in the area of contrast agents and medical equip-
ment is to steadily improve our contrast agents and our contrast injection, thrombus removal and other
vascular intervention systems in order to build on our leadership position. We also intend to enter
additional attractive segments such as medical data management tools for contrast agents and contrast
injection systems. Our research and development centers are located near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and
Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the United States; in Berlin, Germany; and in Sydney, Australia. In August
2012, the European regulatory authorities extended their approval of the contrast agent Gadovist™
(active ingredient: gadobutrol) to include the diagnosis of diseases in the whole body by magnetic reso-
nance imaging ()1! ). Further clinical studies are currently ongoing with gadobutrol in a variety of indi-
cations for marketing approval in other countries. Gadovist™/ Gadavist™ was first registered in 1998 and
is now approved in more than 90 countries. In September 2012, we introduced our Jetstream™ atherec-
tomy system at the annual meeting of the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of
Europe (,!1’$ ). The device can be used to treat a wide range of vessel diameters and features continu-
ous active aspiration to remove excised stenotic material and thrombus from the treatment site. A
unique technology allowing its use in thrombus, soft plaque and calcified lesions, the Jetstream™ device
offers an additional treatment option for peripheral artery disease ((*%).

The Animal Health Division focuses its research and development activities at the Monheim site in
Germany on antibiotics and antiparasitics as well as active substances to treat non-infectious disorders
in animals. The research activities of Animal Health have been integrated with the Global Drug Discov-
ery unit of 5/, since March 2011. The advantage lies in the joint use of technology platforms and the
pooling of know-how and experience in drug discovery. At the same time, Animal Health continues to
collaborate with CropScience research, especially in the area of parasitology. Thus we are exploiting
the advantage we have as the only company in the world that conducts research within the same orga-
nization into improving the health of people, animals and plants. As well as developing new products to
combat bacterial infections and parasites in companion animals and livestock, we are continuing to
expand the product portfolio for the treatment of chronic kidney diseases in cats. In addition, a number
of product line extensions were approved in different markets, such as Seresto™ (active ingredients:
imidacloprid and flumethrin) in Europe. Seresto™ is a collar for dogs and cats with considerably longer

duration of action against ticks and fleas.

Establishment of a joint research center

In 2008 we entered into a strategic alliance with the German Cancer Research Center (%8.7) in Heidel-
berg, Germany, which is focused on the identification and early development of new therapeutic ap-
proaches for cancer. This collaboration is designed to turn new scientific discoveries about cancer into
new medicines or therapies as quickly as possible. In 2011, the partnership was extended for an addi-
tional three years. A total of 19 projects have been initiated so far.

Since 2009, we have operated the internet platform “Grants4Targets.” With this crowdsourcing ap-
proach, we give researchers at universities, other research institutions or start-up companies the oppor-
tunity to propose biological target structures for cooperation with Bayer through an internet portal. We
make expertise and financial assistance available to researchers to support the discovery of new thera-
peutic approaches in oncology, gynecology, cardiology and hematology. By combining the expertise of
industry and academia, we aim to accelerate the progression from fundamental research to new and
promising treatment options. A total of 825 applications have been submitted via internet so far, of
which 114 projects are receiving support.

Since 2011, we have been collaborating with the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute (+5!) for Pulmonary Vessel
Research in Austria on research into disorders of the pulmonary blood vessels, particularly pulmonary
hypertension. A further collaboration with a Ludwig Boltzmann Institute, the +5! for Translational Heart
Failure Research in Austria, was formed in October 2011 to search for new approaches to treat myocar-
dial insufficiency.

In March 2012, we signed an agreement with Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, to collaborate over
a three-year period in the field of biomedical sciences. The agreement further expands our existing stra-
tegic cooperation at the Bayer-Tsinghua Joint Research Center for Innovative Drug Discovery (5#, ).

In April 2012, we extended our cooperation with Amgen Research GmbH, Munich, Germany, to include
the research, development and commercialization of a new bispecific T-cell engager (BiITE™) antibody
against a new, undisclosed target structure expressed in multiple tumors. Under the terms of the present
agreement, we will collaborate with Amgen from the research phase through the completion of any
Phase ! clinical trials, upon which we will assume full control of further development and potential com-
mercialization of the antibody.

In September 2012, we opened “CoLaborator™” — a new center in the Mission Bay district of San Fran-
cisco, California, United States, for young bioscience firms. This incubator concept is geared toward
supporting young start-up companies founded by academic researchers. The scientists benefit from both
the laboratory infrastructure and the expertise of the Bayer researchers and the potential this offers for
the professional, goal-oriented design of development programs. At the same time, we aim to be the ini-
tial contact point for young companies in their search for possible cooperation partners.

In October 2012, we entered into a strategic alliance with Evotec AG, Hamburg. Together with this com-
pany we will carry out research into multiple target molecules associated with endometriosis over a five-
year period. The aim is to identify three drug candidates for clinical development in the treatment of this
disorder.

In October 2012, we signed an agreement with Qiagen Manchester Ltd., - .8., to jointly develop molecu-
lar in-vitro tests, also known as companion diagnostics. These tests are to be used to identify patients
who are highly likely to respond to new cancer drugs from HealthCare.

CROPSCIENCE

One of the aims of CropScience is to offer its customers tailored and innovative solutions for selected
crops along the entire value chain, and in doing so to support agriculture and help to feed the world
population. To achieve this aim, CropScience is investing heavily to research and develop new products,
focusing increasingly on seed and new growth areas such as plant health and stress tolerance. Crop-
Science also utilizes its global network of partners from science and industry to drive growth through
joint development projects.

In 2012, €782 million (2011: €723 million) in research and development expenditures, or 26.0% of the
Bayer Group total, were made in the CropScience subgroup. This was equivalent to 9.3% (2011: 10.0%)
of subgroup sales.
CropScience maintains a global network of research and development facilities employing some 4,400
people. Our largest 19% sites for crop protection products are located in Monheim and Frankfurt am
Main, Germany, and in Lyon, France. The major research centers of the Seeds unit, which focuses on
improving seed through seed technology and breeding, are located in Ghent, Belgium; Haelen, Nether-
lands; and in Morrisville, North Carolina, and Lubbock, Texas, United States. The acquisition of Agra-
Quest, Inc. added a new facility for biological crop protection products in Davis, California, United
States, to the research and development network.

While research is carried out centrally at a small number of sites, our development and plant breeding
activities take place both at these sites and at numerous field testing stations across the globe. This en-
sures that future active substances and crop varieties can be tested according to specific regional re-
quirements.

To better respond to the future development of global markets, we are increasing our research and de-
velopment spending in the Seeds unit, with its seeds and traits, and in new growth areas such as plant
health and stress tolerance. Our biologics research, which focuses on biological crop protection prod-
ucts, is also to be expanded following the acquisition of - .’. company AgraQuest. We plan to invest a to-
tal of some €5 billion in research and development between 2011 and 2016.

As part of our integrated research approach, our scientists in the fields of seed technology, agricultural
chemistry and biologics are working increasingly closely to optimally pool the expertise acquired
through chemical and biological research as well as field development, and align it to our long-term
research objectives and business strategies for the various crops.

In the Crop Protection unit, we identify and develop innovative, safe and sustainable products for use
in agriculture as insecticides, fungicides, herbicides or seed treatments. In the fields of chemistry, biolo-
gy and biochemistry, modern technologies such as genetic analysis, high-throughput screening and
bioinformatics play an important role in identifying new chemical lead structures. Collaborations with
external partners complement our own activities.

In addition, we are broadening the range of uses for our products by developing new mixtures or inno-
vative formulations of products already on the market so that they can be applied in additional crops or
be made easier to handle.

In addition to numerous seed varieties, our integrated product pipeline in crop protection and seed tech-
nology contains a total of over 30 projects with estimated launch dates between 2011 and 2016 anda
combined peak sales potential in excess of €4 billion. During this period, Crop Protection plans to begin
marketing for eight projects in the area of chemical crop protection and a number of biological crop pro-
tection products; in our Seeds business, we plan to bring more than 15 projects to market-readiness for
the broad-acre crops of cotton, oilseed rape/canola, rice, wheat and soybeans alone; and we also intend
to launch several hundred new vegetable varieties under the Nunhems™ brand.

During 2012 we achieved further progress with product registrations. For example, the fungicide Luna™
(fluopyram) was approved by the - .’. Environmental Protection Agency ($(* ). It was already available in
the United States for the 2012 growing season. Luna™ was developed to combat a number of problemat-
ic fungal diseases in fruit and vegetables. It enables excellent disease control and ensures better stor-
ability and longer shelf life of the harvested produce, thus playing an important part in ensuring supply
security. Luna™ is now approved in various countries of North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and
Africa. In March 2012, we were granted the first marketing authorization worldwide from the Canadian
authorities for the new fungicidal seed treatment EverGol™ (penflufen) and began introducing this prod-
uct to the market. Further registrations for the EverGol™’/Emesto™ product line were received in the
United States. These products offer farmers much better options for controlling fungal diseases even at
very low application rates.
In addition to numerous new formulations, we plan to launch three promising new chemical crop protec-
tion products during the period through 2016, subject to their successful registration:

Planned Product Launches [Table 3.31]

New Bayer brand (N.N.) Insecticide 2014
New Bayer brand (triafamone) Herbicide: control of various weeds,

including millet and grass species;

preventive application possible 2015
Another event in 2012 was the acquisition by CropScience of - .’. company AgraQuest, Inc., headquar-

tered in Davis, California. The transaction closed in August 2012 and will enable CropScience to further
expand its research and its product pipeline in the area of biological crop protection. AgraQuest is a
global supplier of innovative biological pest management solutions based on natural microorganisms.
The acquisition is also aimed at enabling us to build a leading technology platform for biological crop
protection products and further strengthen our strategically important vegetables business.

In Seeds we are conducting research to improve plant traits and are developing new seed varieties in
our established core crops — cotton, oilseed rape/canola, rice and vegetables. We have extended our
research activities to include two new core crops — cereals and soybeans. Our research and develop-
ment activities focus on the agronomic traits of these crops. Our researchers are working to increase
the quality and yield potential of crop plants — for example, by improving the profile of rapeseed (cano-
la) oil or enhancing the properties of cotton fibers. We are also targeting the development of plants with
high tolerance against external stress factors such as extreme temperatures and drought. Further areas
of focus include developing new herbicide tolerance technologies based on alternative mechanisms of
action, and improving insect resistance and disease tolerance. To do this we employ modern breeding
techniques ranging from marker-assisted breeding to plant biotechnology methods.

In addition to our own proprietary products, we have strengthened our Seeds business through strategic
acquisitions. In 2012, for example, we acquired the watermelon and melon seed business of Abbott s
Cobb Inc., headquartered in Feasterville, Pennsylvania, United States. The acquisition supports our veg-
etable seed business. We also formed several research alliances in 2012, including a collaboration for
the development and marketing of wheat with the Texas AgriLife research institute of Texas *9) Univer-
sity in the United States. These partnerships will support our enhanced focus on the Seeds business.

Business growth at Seeds is also supported by the introduction of new varieties and traits.

In the first quarter of 2012, we began commercializing conventional oilseed rape varieties in several
European countries, thus taking a major step toward regional expansion in this crop.

In 2011, we launched our proprietary glyphosate herbicide tolerance technology GlyTol™ in FiberMax™
cotton seed varieties in the United States.
In 2014, we plan to offer a new combined insect-resistance and herbicide-tolerance solution for cotton,
featuring both TwinLink™ and GlyTol™ technologies for the first time, offering farmers integrated pest
and weed control. We also expect to launch a new hybrid canola seed line in Australia in 2014.

Starting in 2014, we plan to commercialize a number of new hybrid rice varieties with improved stress
and insect resistance under the Arize™ brand.

By 2015 we intend to offer soybean farmers in North America a groundbreaking herbicide-tolerant
trait stack with a new mode of action. This product will be tolerant to both isoxaflutole and glyphosate
herbicides and will be an important resistance management tool.

We are steadily bringing new vegetable seeds to market under the Nunhems™ brand, with around 70
varieties introduced in 2012 and a comparable number of innovations anticipated for 2013.

The Environmental Science unit tests compounds developed by Crop Protection or with external part-
ners and evaluates them for possible non-agricultural uses. Current development projects include gels
and baits to combat insect pests, as well as herbicides, fungicides, biological solutions, and products for
the control of disease-transmitting insects.

In 2012, the Environmental Science portfolio was further expanded in the United States — partly through
the successful launch of Esplanade™, a product for professional users based on the active ingredient in-
daziflam, and the consumer product Durazone™. In Europe, we strengthened the Bayer Garden™ busi-
ness by launching Permaclean™, our new combination product with residual action. Environmental
Science also made good progress with the introduction of LifeNet™ mosquito nets. Further registrations
were achieved, and the product is now approved in 19 African countries.

Open innovation

CropScience has assembled a global network of research and industry partners from diverse seg-
ments of the agriculture industry, chemical and biological research, and the food industry. These

cross-industry partnerships enable us to better understand and do justice to the needs of our cus-
tomers over the long term.

CropScience conducts research in collaboration with many partners around the world. For example, we
extended the successful research collaboration between CropScience and the Innovative Vector Control
Consortium (!",, ) in the - .8. Initially established as a research consortium in November 2005, the !",,
has since evolved into a product development partnership ((%(). The !",,_ contributes know-how and
technical resources to jointly drive the development of new insecticides for vector control in the public
health sector and the related information systems. The parties have agreed to cooperate for a further
three years in the search for new active ingredients effective against mosquitoes, which transmit dis-
eases such as malaria and dengue fever.

In the Seeds business, an important partnership exists with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
Research Organisation (,’!10 ) and the Grains Research and Development Corporation (31%, ) in Austra-
lia. CropScience and the ,"!10 began strategic collaborations in wheat research in 2009. The aim of the
research partnership between CropScience, the ,’!10 and the 31%, is to discover innovative ways to
raise wheat yields and thus make global wheat production more sustainable. The partnership, an-
nounced in 2012, results from the development by the ,"!10 of a biotechnological process that raised
wheat yields in greenhouse testing.

Special mention should be made of our food chain partnerships. Our worldwide in-house network of
country organizations enables us to collaborate with other companies throughout the global food chain,
adding value to it in ways that include ensuring traceability and increasing the quality of produce. Our
expertise in the crop protection and seeds businesses thus helps to create the basis for healthy nutri-
tion, sustainable food production and compliance with food safety standards. Among the main partners
participating in the 240 food chain partnerships are - .’ -based PepsiCo, Inc., and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,
and the -&!"$3 group of Belgium. As part of the project with -&!"$3 , one of the world’s largest fruit
and vegetable wholesalers, quality table grapes from India reached the European market for the first
time at the beginning of 2012. CropScience has developed its own identity document for participating
farmers with the aim of improving traceability and data management. This identity document ensures
that -&!"$3 in Europe can satisfy the strict regulatory requirements regarding quality, safety, traceabili-
ty and sustainability.

Strengthening research in the life sciences

Bayer is the only global company simultaneously researching improvements in human, animal and plant
health. From this unique position, Bayer is also breaking new ground in terms of innovation strategy.
Systematic, greatly intensified collaboration among researchers across subgroup boundaries is serving
to stimulate innovation. In 2012, a concept was developed to enable researchers in our two life-science
subgroups — HealthCare and CropScience — to make optimum use of collaboration opportunities. The
concept includes a Life Sciences Fund that provides some €30 million annually in finance for new tech-
nology platforms and research projects established in collaboration with other companies or research in-
stitutes. The aim is to support central areas of research such as gene regulation, energy metabolism and
molecular signaling pathways and to increase the joint use of groundbreaking technology platforms.
Systematically exploiting life-science synergies in this way will enable Bayer to continue strengthening
its innovative potential in pharmaceuticals, animal health and the agriculture business.

MATERIALSCIENCE

Research activities at MaterialScience are focused in part on the development of plastics manufacturing
processes that conserve energy and resources. In addition, the subgroup works closely with customers
to develop new applications for our high-tech materials that can help to improve energy and resource
efficiency or safety, for example.

In 2012, MaterialScience spent €242 million (2011: €237 million) for research and development. The
subgroup thus accounted for roughly 8.0% of the Bayer Group’s total research and development ex-
penses. The ratio of 19% expenses to sales in the subgroup itself was 2.1% (2011: 2.2%). In addition,
MaterialScience spent €115 million (2011: €118 million) on joint development projects with customers.

A total of about 900 people were employed in research and development in 2012, many of them at our
Innovation Centers in Leverkusen, Germany, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, or at the Poly-
mer Research s Development Center in Shanghai, China. The facility in Shanghai was expanded in 2011
and plays a key role in developing new products for the Asian market and enlarging Bayer’s technical
expertise in the region. At the same time, this local presence is aimed at more closely linking the compa-
ny’s research and development activities with customers in the emerging markets.

The focus in the Polyurethanes (,-. ) business unit is on further increasing the efficiency of polyure-
thane rigid foam as an insulating material against cold and heat. Polyurethane plays a key role in helping
to reduce energy consumption and protect the climate, especially in the construction industry and along
the cold storage chain. Our innovations are geared toward further enhancing the material's insulating
properties and optimizing flame retardancy in particular.

An exemplary innovation that considerably raises energy efficiency in refrigerated appliances is our
Baytherm™ Microcell. Compared with current standard solutions, this novel material has up to 10%
lower thermal conductivity thanks to substantially smaller pores. An efficient cold storage chain is of
great importance, particularly in light of increasing urbanization in the emerging countries. We aim to
support economic development in these countries with innovations on many levels — such as mobility.
In the automotive industry, techniques such as lightweight construction, which reduces fuel consump-
tion, are rapidly gaining ground. Our polyurethane supports this trend. Our new Bayflex™ /0 system,
which is lighter even than water, enables an up to 30% weight reduction in car body parts.

In the area of process development, we aim to further improve efficiency in order to safeguard our cost
leadership for the long term. Our objective is to manufacture polyurethane raw materials with minimum
energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. For example, we are working on the use of renew-
able raw materials — and also of carbon dioxide — as feedstocks for polymers. In early 2011, for example,
we started up a globally unique pilot plant in Leverkusen that produces polyether polycarbonate polyol
((((_) —a starting material for polyurethanes — using waste carbon dioxide.

Our research and innovation activities in the Polycarbonates (,*+ ) business unit focus on developing
new products, particularly for weight-saving applications, that set new energy efficiency and safety stan-
dards and allow greater design freedom. Here we concentrate on selected development areas.

In the consumer electronics sector, new applications for our materials are resulting in components that
are lighter, more compact, flame-retardant and at the same time break-resistant. MaterialScience there-
fore cooperates with partners — including the Institute for Composite Materials (!"2 ) in Kaiserslautern,
Germany — to develop reduced-weight and glass-fiber-reinforced materials for applications such as ultra-
mobile laptops. These materials enable the production of extremely thin-walled yet durable housing
components that cater both to consumers’ habits and to the !# industry's stringent flame-retardancy re-
quirements.

We are also developing polycarbonate materials for +$%illumination management. +$% have a broad ar-
ray of applications — from street lighting to special uses such as the front headlamps of vehicles. Here,
the considerably lower electricity consumption and the ability to produce ultra-small lamps play a major
role. A current focus is on building a portfolio of materials for this field of application. In addition to ma-
terials with customized optical properties, such as those for optical lenses or light guides, we are devel-
oping a thermally conductive material to direct the heat development that occurs particularly in +$%
away from the housing.

Another innovation is the use of recycled plastics such as Bayblend™ 1. polycarbonate blends in laptop
housings, for example.

In the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialties (*"+) business unit, we are driving the development of raw mate-
rials for high-performance polyurethane coatings, adhesives and sealants.

Extreme-durability coatings are used in automobiles, buses, trains, ships and airplanes, for example,
and are also needed for wind turbines, pipelines and steel structures. All of these markets are showing
strong, steady growth. Our development work is directed toward the next generation of environmental-
ly friendly coatings, which consume less resources and can be more efficiently applied. Here we are
concentrating on low-solvent, solvent-free and waterborne systems. As we continue to develop our ad-
hesives and sealants portfolio, we are again focusing on environmentally compatible and user-friendly
systems to replace the solvent-based systems that still are widely used.

In addition to these conventional fields of application, we are evolving our portfolio of products and solu-
tions toward new and lucrative market segments based on the outstanding mechanical and optical proper-
ties and broad diversity of aliphatic polyurethane systems.
Our activities in functional films partly center on products based on polycarbonates or thermoplastic
polyurethanes. Multifunctional or holographic films are created by using additional surface technologies
and modifying the material properties. These open up new fields of application in attractive areas such
as 3%flat panel displays. Another area of focus is on electroactive polymers ($*() as a platform technol-
ogy. Our research activities relate mainly to polymer films that serve as a basis for developing alternative
engine and generator designs and sensor films together with industrial partners.

In addition to specific development activities, we are also involved in certain interdisciplinary develop-
ments. An example is a special system solution for the manufacture of coated parts for use in automotive
interiors, for example. It is produced in a single process step, yielding significant cost advantages and
boosting productivity.

Open innovation

In line with the open innovation approach, MaterialScience increasingly collaborates with external sci-
entific institutions such as 12#/ Aachen University in Germany and the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
China. Our innovation capability is also spurred by collaborations with customers or other industry sec-
tors, such as via the future_bizz corporate network (222. ..-#-1$ -5!77.%§. We aim to work with the best
partners from the industry sectors that are important to us in order to combine competencies and turn
them into innovations. External networks in science and industry are nurtured both by the business units
and centrally through the New Business department.

A successful alliance with Kast GmbH s Co., Germany, and the Institute of Concrete Structures and
Building Materials at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (8!#) involves the development of a special adhe-
sive for buildings. In combination with a glass fiber fabric, it can strengthen masonry and thus delay the
collapse of walls in the event of an earthquake. Another advantage of the system, named 23 -Top™, is
that it is easy to use because it can be hung like wallpaper.

In the area of energy efficiency, we developed the innovative, modular street lighting concept “Eco
StreetLine” in cooperation with Hella KgaA, Germany. The use of efficient +$%technology reduces ener-
gy consumption compared with conventional street lighting, while the long service life of the optical
lenses cuts operating costs.

In collaboration with Hella KGaA and the Fraunhofer Institute of Laser Technology in Aachen, Germany,
we have also developed a process chain for the manufacture of plastic free-form optics for automotive
lighting. The project received funding from the German Ministry of Education and Research.

BAYER TECHNOLOGY SERVICES

Bayer Technology Services is an important research, development and engineering partner for the en-
tire Bayer Group. All Bayer subgroups work closely with this service company worldwide on technology
solutions, particularly in the fields of process technology, plant engineering, automation and product
development.

Together with the subgroups, Bayer Technology Services is developing new energy- and resource-
efficient production processes to safeguard technology and cost leadership over the long term. An ex-
ample is polymer synthesis for MaterialScience. Centralized development work on technologies rele-
vant to more than one subgroup, such as nanotechnology and biotechnology, along with expertise in
mathematical simulation and statistical data analysis, is important for HealthCare and CropScience so
that they can accelerate the development of new products. This also includes the development of en-
tirely new production concepts at facilities such as the !&"!#$ research center, a collaborative venture
between Bayer Technology Services and Dortmund Technical University. New flexible, modular pro-
duction concepts being developed for HealthCare are an example in this area.

12. Takeover-Relevant Information

EXPLANATORY REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 289 PARAGRAPH 4 AND 315
PARAGRAPH 4 OF THE GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE (HGB)

The capital stock of Bayer AG amounted as of December 31, 2012 to €2,117 million, divided into
826,947,808 no-par bearer shares. The capital stock and the number of shares were thus unchanged
from the end of the previous year. Each share confers one voting right.

A small number of shares may be subject to temporary trading restrictions, such as retention periods,
in connection with employee stock participation programs.

We received no notifications in 2012 of direct or indirect holdings of shares in Bayer AG that exceed
10% of the capital stock. The company thus is not in possession of any notifications of holdings that
exceed 10% of the capital stock.

Pursuant to Section 84, Paragraph 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the members of the
Board of Management are appointed and dismissed by the Supervisory Board. Since Bayer AG falls
within the scope of the German Codetermination Act, the appointment or dismissal of members of the
Board of Management requires a majority of two thirds of the votes of the members of the Supervisory
Board on the first ballot. If no such majority is achieved, the appointment may be approved pursuant to
Section 31, Paragraph 3 of the Codetermination Act on a second ballot by a simple majority of the
votes of the members of the Supervisory Board. If the required majority still is not achieved, a third
ballot is held. Here again, a simple majority of the votes suffices, but in this ballot the Chairman of the
Supervisory Board has two votes pursuant to Section 31, Paragraph 4 of the Codetermination Act. Un-
der Section 6, Paragraph 1 of the Articles of Incorporation of Bayer AG, the Board of Management
must comprise at least two members. The Supervisory Board may appoint one member to be Chairman
of the Board of Management pursuant to Section 84, Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act
or Section 6, Paragraph 1 of the Articles of Incorporation.

Under Section 179, Paragraph 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act, amendments to the Articles of
Incorporation require a resolution of the Stockholders’ Meeting. Pursuant to Section 179, Paragraph 2
of the German Stock Corporation Act, this resolution must be passed by a majority of three quarters of
the voting capital represented at the meeting, unless the Articles of Incorporation provide for a differ-
ent majority. However, where an amendment relates to a change in the object of the company, the
Articles of Incorporation may only specify a larger majority. Section 17, Paragraph 2 of the Articles of
Incorporation of Bayer AG utilizes the scope for deviation pursuant to Section 179, Paragraph 2 of the
German Stock Corporation Act and provides that resolutions may be passed by a simple majority of
the votes or, where a capital majority is required, by a simple majority of the capital.

Provisions of the Articles of Incorporation concerning Authorized Capital ! and Authorized Capital !!
are entered in the commercial register of Bayer AG. With the approval of the Supervisory Board and
until April 29, 2015, the Board of Management may use the Authorized Capital ! to increase the capital
stock by up to a total of €530 million. New shares may be issued against cash contributions and/or con-
tributions in kind, but capital increases against contributions in kind may not exceed a total of €423
million. If the Authorized Capital ! is used to issue shares in return for cash contributions, stockholders
must normally be granted subscription rights. The Board of Management may only exclude stockhold-
ers’ subscription rights to shares issued out of the Authorized Capital ! that do not represent more than
20% of the existing capital stock. Absent a further resolution on the exclusion of stockholders’ sub-
scription rights, the Board of Management also may only exclude stockholders’ subscription rights to
shares issued under other authorizations regarding capital measures (Authorized Capital !!, bonds with
warrants or convertible bonds, purchase and sale of own shares) provided that such shares do not in
total represent more than 20% of the existing capital stock.
With the approval of the Supervisory Board and until April 29, 2015, the Board of Management is also
authorized to increase the capital by up to €212 million in one or more installments by issuing shares
out of the Authorized Capital !! in exchange for cash contributions. The stockholders must normally be
granted subscription rights. However, the Board of Management is authorized, with the approval of the
Supervisory Board, to exclude subscription rights for stockholders provided the capital increase out of
the Authorized Capital !! does not exceed 10% of the capital stock existing at the time this authoriza-
tion becomes effective or the time this authorization is exercised and the issue price of the new shares
is not significantly below the market price of the already listed shares.

Conditional capital of €212 million exists in connection with an authorization — valid through April 29,
2015 — to issue bonds with warrants or convertible bonds, profit-sharing rights or profit participation
bonds (collectively referred to as “bonds”) with a total face value of €6 billion. The Board of Manage-
ment may, with the consent of the Supervisory Board and under certain conditions, exclude the bond
subscription rights that would otherwise be granted to stockholders. One of the conditions is that the
total amount of the shares required to service the bonds does not exceed 10% of the capital stock.
Any other shares issued without granting subscription rights to the stockholders in direct or analogous
application of Section 186, Paragraph 3, Sentence 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act shall be
credited against this 10% limit. Further, the 2010 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting authorized the Board
of Management to purchase and sell company shares representing up to 10% of the capital stock. This
authorization also expires on April 29, 2015.

A material agreement that is subject to the condition precedent of a change of control pertains to the
undrawn €3.5 billion syndicated credit facility arranged by Bayer AG and its " .#. subsidiary Bayer
Corporation. This facility is initially available until 2017 following a one-year extension. The participat-
ing banks are entitled to terminate the credit facility in the event of a change of control at Bayer and
demand repayment of any loans that may have been granted under this facility up to that time.

In addition, the terms of the €3.3 billion (as of December 31, 2012) in notes issued by Bayer in the
years 2006 to 2012 under its multi-currency European Medium Term Notes program also contain a
change-of-control clause. Holders of these notes have the right to demand the redemption of their
notes by Bayer AG in the event of a change of control if Bayer AG’s credit rating is downgraded within
120 days after such change of control becomes effective.

Agreements exist for the members of the Board of Management in compliance with Section 4.2.3 of
the German Corporate Governance Code to cover the eventuality of a takeover offer being made for
Bayer AG. Under these agreements, payments promised in the event of early termination of the service
contract of a Board of Management member due to a change of control are limited to the value of three
years’ compensation and may not compensate more than the remaining term of the contract.

Corporate Governance Code.

13.1 Declaration on Corporate Governance*

* not part of the audited management report

DECLARATION BY THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISORY BOARD
concerning the German Corporate Governance Code (May , version) pursuant to Section of the
German Stock Corporation Act**

Under Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Board of Management and the Supervisory
Board of Bayer AG are required to issue an annual declaration that the company has been, and is, in
compliance with the recommendations of the “Government Commission on the German Corporate Gover-
nance Code” as published by the Federal Ministry of Justice in the official section of the electronic Federal
Gazette (Bundesanzeiger), or to advise of any recommendations that have not been, or are not being,
applied and the reasons for this. An annual declaration was last issued in December 2011 and amended in
February 2012.

With respect to the past, the following declaration refers to the May 26, 2010 version of the Code. With
respect to present and future corporate governance practices at Bayer AG, the following declaration refers
to the recommendations in the May 15, 2012 version of the Code.

Pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Board of Management and Super-
visory Board of Bayer AG hereby declare as follows:

1. The company has been in compliance with the recommendations of the Code since issuance of
the last annual compliance declaration in December 2011 with the temporary exception stated in
the amendment thereto dated February 2012. The recommendation given in Section 5.4.6 Para-
graph 2 of the May 26, 2010 version of the Code was not complied with.

The Annual Stockholders’ Meeting 2012, acting on a proposal from the Board of Management and the
Supervisory Board, resolved to introduce a new system of Supervisory Board compensation compris-
ing fixed compensation only by way of an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation. Section 5.4.6
Paragraph 2 of the May 2010 version of the Code contained a recommendation that performance-
related compensation be paid in addition to fixed compensation. The May 15, 2012 version of the
Code no longer contains this recommendation.

2. All the recommendations of the Code are now being complied with in full.

BAYER IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GERMAN CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE CODE

Bayer has always placed great importance on responsible corporate governance and will continue to do
so. In 2012 the company was able to issue a declaration that it had complied with the recommendations
of the German Corporate Governance Code in the past with one temporary exception and was now fully
compliant again. The deviation from Section 5.4.6 Paragraph 2 Sentence 1 of the May 26, 2010 version
of the German Corporate Governance Code, stated in the February 2012 amendment to the previous
declaration, no longer applies because the recommendation given in this section of the Code has since
been altered.

& INTERNET

In 2012, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board again addressed the question of compliance
with the Corporate Governance Code, particularly in light of the Code amendments of May 15, 2012. The We publish voting rights

DUTIES AND ACTIVITIES OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
Bayer AG is a strategic management holding company, run by its Board of Management on the Board’s
own responsibility with the goal of sustainably increasing the company’s enterprise value and achieving
defined corporate objectives. The Board of Management performs its tasks according to the law, the
Articles of Incorporation and the Board's rules of procedure, and works with the company’s other gover-
nance bodies in a spirit of trust.

The Board of Management defines the long-term goals and the strategies for the Group, its subgroups
and its service companies, and sets forth the principles and directives for the resulting corporate poli-
cies. It coordinates and monitors the most important activities, defines the portfolio, develops and de-
ploys managerial staff, allocates resources and decides on the Group’s financial steering and reporting.

The members of the Board of Management bear joint responsibility for running the business as a whole.
However, the individual members manage the areas assigned to them on their own responsibility within
the framework of the decisions made by the entire Board. The allocation of duties among the members
of the Board of Management is defined in a written schedule.

The entire Board of Management makes decisions on all matters of fundamental importance and in cases
where a decision of the entire Board is prescribed by law or otherwise mandatory. The rules of procedure
of the Board of Management contain a list of topics that must be dealt with and resolved by the entire
Board.

Meetings of the Board of Management are held regularly. They are convened by the Chairman of the
Board of Management. Any member of the Board of Management may also demand that a meeting be
held. The Board of Management makes decisions by a simple majority of the votes cast, except where
unanimity is required by law. In the event of a tie, the Chairman has the casting vote.

According to the Board of Management’s rules of procedure and schedule of duties, the Chairman bears
particular responsibility for leading and coordinating the Board's work. He represents the company and
the Group in dealings with third parties and the workforce on matters relating to more than one part of
the company or the Group. He also bears special responsibility for certain departments of the Corporate
Center and their fields of activity.

The schedule of duties also assigns particular areas of specialist responsibility to the other three mem-
bers who served on the Board of Management in 2012 with respective responsibility for Finance;
Innovation, Technology and Sustainability; and Strategy and Human Resources. Each of these members
also represents certain geographical regions.

No committees of the Board of Management have been set up in view of the small number of members
and the role of Bayer AG as a strategic management holding company.
SUPERVISORY BOARD: OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS

The role of the 20-member Supervisory Board is to oversee and advise the Board of Management. Under
the German Codetermination Act, half the members of the Supervisory Board are elected by the stockhold-
ers, and half by the company’s employees. The Supervisory Board is directly involved in decisions on
matters of fundamental importance to the company, regularly conferring with the Board of Management
on the company’s strategic alignment and the implementation status of the business strategy.

The Chairman of the Supervisory Board coordinates its work and presides over the meetings. Through
regular discussions with the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board is kept constantly informed
of business policy, corporate planning and strategy. The Supervisory Board approves the annual budget
and financial framework. It also approves the financial statements of Bayer AG and the consolidated
financial statements of the Bayer Group, along with the combined management report, taking into ac-
count the reports by the auditor.

COMMITTEES OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The Supervisory Board currently has the following committees:

Presidial Committee: This comprises the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board along
with a further stockholder representative and a further employee representative. The Presidial Commit-
tee serves primarily as the mediation committee pursuant to the German Codetermination Act. It has the
task of submitting proposals to the Supervisory Board on the appointment of members of the Board of
Management if the necessary two-thirds majority is not achieved in the first vote at a plenary meeting.
Certain decision-making powers in connection with capital measures, including the power to amend the
Articles of Incorporation accordingly, have also been delegated to this committee.

Audit Committee: The Audit Committee comprises three stockholder representatives and three employee
representatives. The Chairman of the Audit Committee in 2012, Dr. Klaus Sturany, satisfies the statutory re-
quirements concerning the independence and the expertise in the field of accounting or auditing that a
member of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee is required to possess. The Audit Committee
meets regularly four times a year. Its tasks include examining the company’s financial reporting along with
the financial statements of Bayer AG, the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group, the com-
bined management report, the proposal for the use of the distributable profit of Bayer AG, and the interim
financial statements and management reports of the Bayer Group, all of which are prepared by the Board
of Management. On the basis of the auditor’s report on the audit of the financial statements of Bayer AG,
the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group and the combined management report, the Audit
Committee develops proposals concerning the approval of the statements by the full Supervisory Board.
The Audit Committee is also responsible for the company’s relationship with the external auditor. The Au-
dit Committee submits a proposal to the full Supervisory Board concerning the auditor’s appointment, pre-
pares the awarding of the audit contract to the audit firm appointed by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting,
suggests areas of focus for the audit and determines the auditor’s remuneration. It also monitors the inde-
pendence, qualifications, rotation and efficiency of the auditor.

In addition, the Audit Committee oversees the company’s internal control system — along with the proce-
dures used to identify, track and manage risk — and the internal audit system. It also deals with corporate
compliance issues and discusses developments in this area at each of its meetings.

Human Resources Committee: On this committee, too, there is parity of representation between stock-
holders and employees. It consists of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and three other members.
The Human Resources Committee prepares the personnel decisions of the full Supervisory Board, which
resolves on appointments or dismissals of members of the Board of Management. The Human Resources
Committee resolves on behalf of the Supervisory Board on the service contracts of the members of the
Board of Management. However, it is the task of the full Supervisory Board to resolve on the total com-
pensation of the individual members of the Board of Management and the respective compensation
components, as well as to regularly review the compensation system on the basis of recommendations
submitted by the Human Resources Committee. The Human Resources Committee also discusses the
long-term succession planning for the Board of Management.
Nominations Committee: This committee carries out preparatory work when an election of stockholder
representatives to the Supervisory Board is to be held. It suggests suitable candidates for the Super-
visory Board to propose to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting for election. The Nominations Committee
comprises the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the other stockholder representative on the
Presidial Committee.

Detailed information on the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees is provided in the Report
of the Supervisory Board on page 4off. of this Annual Report.

OBJECTIVES FOR THE COMPOSITION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD

The Supervisory Board should be composed in such a way that its members together possess the
necessary expertise, skills and professional experience to properly perform their duties. In view

of Bayer AG’s global operations, the Supervisory Board has set itself the goal of always having several
members with international business experience or an international background. A further objective
concerning the composition of the Supervisory Board is that, absent special circumstances, its
members should not hold office beyond the end of the next Annual Stockholders’ Meeting following
their 72nd birthday. With a view to avoiding potential conflicts of interest, the Supervisory Board has
set itself the goal that more than half of the stockholder representatives be independent and also that
at least three quarters of the total Supervisory Board membership (stockholder and employee repre-
sentatives) be independent. The Supervisory Board assesses the independence of its members ac-
cording to the recommendation contained in Section 5.4.2 of the May 15, 2012 version of the German
Corporate Governance Code. In assessing independence, the Supervisory Board also considers the
criteria given in the recommendation of the European Commission of February 15, 2005.*

Another goal for the composition of the Supervisory Board is to increase the proportion of women on
the Supervisory Board to at least 20% in the medium term and for the female membership to be dis-
tributed as evenly as possible between the stockholder and employee groups. It is intended to achieve
this goal when the entire Supervisory Board is elected in 2017.

The goals described refer to the Supervisory Board as a whole unless resolved otherwise. However,
since the Supervisory Board can only nominate candidates for election as stockholder representatives,
it can only take the targets into account in these nominations.

Implementation status of the objectives

The Supervisory Board has several members with international business experience and other interna-
tional connections. The target maximum age of 72 is not exceeded by any member of the Supervisory
Board. One member of the Supervisory Board, Werner Wenning, was the Chairman of the company's
Board of Management until 2010. One member, Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker, has been a member of the
Supervisory Board since 1997, and thus has served more than three terms of office. However, neither
Mr. Wenning nor Mr. Winnacker has any personal or business relationship with the company or a gover-
nance body of the company that in the opinion of the Supervisory Board gives rise to a material conflict
of interest of a more than temporary nature. The elections to the Supervisory Board held in 2012 result-
ed in an increase in the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board from 10% to 15%.

DISCLOSURE OF SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS BY MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF
MANAGEMENT OR SUPERVISORY BOARD

Members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board and their close relatives are legally re-
quired to disclose all transactions involving the purchase or sale of Bayer stock where such transactions
total €5,000 or more in a calendar year. Bayer publishes details of such transactions immediately on its
website and also notifies the German Financial Supervisory Authority accordingly. This information is
provided to the company register for archiving. No such transactions were reported to Bayer AG in 2012.

Information filed with the company by members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board
shows that, on the closing date for the financial statements, their total holdings of Bayer AG stock or re-
lated financial instruments were equivalent to less than 1% of the issued stock.

1 Annex 2 to the recommendation of the European Commission of February 15, 2005, on the role of non-executive or supervisory directors of
listed companies and on the committees of the (supervisory) board (2005/162/EC)
COMMON VALUES AND LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES

Bayer has committed itself to the values of Leadership, Integrity, Flexibility and Efficiency, or “$!%&for
short. These values provide guidance to all Bayer employees, both in business dealings and in working
together within the company. All employees are obligated to align their work to the $!%avalues. This is

taken into account in human resources development and the regular performance evaluations.

SYSTEMATIC RISK MANAGEMENT

The established control system enables the company to identify any business or financial risks at an early
stage and take appropriate action to manage them. This control system is designed to ensure that risks are
monitored in a timely manner, all business transactions are properly accounted for, and reliable data on the
company’s financial position is always available.

When acquisitions are made, we aim to bring the acquired units’ internal control systems into line with
those of the Bayer Group as quickly as possible.

However, the control and risk management system cannot provide absolute protection against losses
arising from business risks or fraudulent actions.

CORPORATE COMPLIANCE

Our corporate activity is governed by national and local laws and statutes that place a range of obliga-
tions on the Bayer Group and its employees throughout the world. Bayer manages its business responsi-
bly and in compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements of the countries in which it oper-
ates.

Bayer expects legally and ethically impeccable conduct from all of its employees in daily business opera-
tions, as the way they carry out their duties affects the company’s reputation. By ensuring regular dia-
logue between employees and their supervisors and providing training courses involving the responsible
Compliance Officers, the company endeavors to acquaint its employees with internal codes of behavior
and with the numerous statutory and regulatory requirements of the countries where they work that are
of relevance to them. This lays the foundation for managing the business responsibly and in compliance
with the respective applicable laws.

The Board of Management states in the Corporate Compliance Policy that Bayer is unreservedly com-
mitted to corporate compliance and will forgo any business transactions that would violate compliance
principles. The Policy also details the organizational framework for corporate compliance and specifies
areas in which violations of applicable law can have particularly serious adverse consequences, both for
the entire enterprise and for individual employees. The principles set forth in the Corporate Compliance
Policy are designed to guide employees in their business-related actions and protect them from poten-
tial misconduct. Its core requirements are:

¢ adherence to antitrust regulations,

¢ integrity in business transactions and the ban on exerting any kind of improper influence,

¢ the observance of product stewardship and the commitment to the principle of sustainability,
¢ the strict separation of business and personal interests, and

¢ the commitment to ensure fair and respectful working conditions across the enterprise.

Employees may contact their respective supervisors or compliance functions for support and advice on
ensuring legally compliant conduct in specific business situations.
Each country has a Compliance Officer, and some have several local compliance functions with clear-
ly defined responsibilities for the different business units. The main responsibilities of each local compli-
ance function include:

* providing advice to the operational business units,

* monitoring and assessing risks,

* running or arranging compliance training programs,

* investigating any reports of possible compliance violations and initiating appropriate corrective
action, and

* satisfying reporting obligations defined at Group level.

The local Compliance Officers report to Group headquarters and ultimately to the Group Compliance
Officer appointed by the Group Management Board. The Group Compliance Officer and the Head of
Corporate Auditing jointly report at least once a year to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board
on any compliance violations that have been identified.

The topic of integrity is a firmly established part of the performance objectives agreed with all manage-
rial employees. By virtue of their positions, these employees have a special obligation to set an exam-
ple, spread the compliance message increasingly within their companies and take organizational mea-
sures to implement it.

DETAILED REPORTING

To maximize transparency, we provide regular and timely information on the Group’s position and sig-
nificant changes in business activities to stockholders, financial analysts, stockholders’ associations, the
media and the general public. Bayer complies with the recommendations of the Corporate Governance
Code by publishing reports on business trends, financial position, results of operations and related risks
four times a year.

In line with statutory requirements, the members of the Group Management Board provide an assurance
that, to the best of their knowledge, the financial statements of Bayer AG, the consolidated financial
statements of the Bayer Group and the combined management report provide a true and fair view.

The financial statements of Bayer AG, the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group and
the combined management report are published within 90 days following the end of each fiscal year.
During the fiscal year, stockholders and other interested parties are kept informed of developments by
means of the half-year financial report and additional interim reports for the first and third quarters.
The half-year financial report is voluntarily subjected to an audit review by the auditor, whose appoint-
ment by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting also relates specifically to this audit review.

. . . ' : ys & INTERNET
Bayer also provides information at news conferences and analysts’ meetings. In addition, the compa-

ny uses the internet as a platform for timely disclosure of information, including details of the dates For comprehensive

of major publications and events, such as the annual report, quarterly financial reports (Stockholders’ eee Bayer, go to
HY 4,9) (.

Newsletters) or the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting.

In line with the principle of fair disclosure, all stockholders and other principal target groups are
treated equally as regards the communication of valuation-relevant information. All significant new
facts are disclosed immediately to the general public. Stockholders also have immediate access to
the information that Bayer publishes locally in compliance with the stock market regulations of vari-
ous countries.

In addition to our regular reporting, we issue ad-hoc statements on developments that otherwise
might not become publicly known but have the potential to materially affect the price of Bayer stock.
13.2 Compensation Report

The Compensation Report describes the essential features of the compensation system for the members
of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and explains the compensation of the individual
members. The report conforms to the requirements of the German Commercial Code including the
principles of German Accounting Standard No. 17 (’(# 17). It also complies with the recommendations
of the German Corporate Governance Code and the International Financial Reporting Standards (!%(#.

13.2.1 Compensation of the Board of Management

OBJECTIVES

The structure of the compensation system for the Board of Management of Bayer AG is aimed at ensur-
ing performance-oriented corporate governance and a long-term increase in the company’s value. The
core elements of the system include a fixed annual salary, which takes into account the tasks and duties
of the Board of Management members, and a short-term incentivized component that depends on the
attainment of the annual corporate performance targets. In addition, there are two long-term stock-
based components that are directly related to the development of Bayer’s share price over time and
thus are intended to create an incentive for a sustained commitment to the company. The system is also
designed to enable the company to successfully compete for highly qualified executives and to ensure
statutory and regulatory compliance. Board of Management compensation is in line with the basic prin-
ciples of the compensation structure for managerial employees in the Bayer Group. The appropriate-
ness of the system and the compensation level are regularly reviewed by the Supervisory Board, which
then makes any necessary adjustments.

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE

The compensation paid to the members of the Board of Management includes both non-performance-
related and performance-related components. The compensation structure, based on average total
annual compensation and 100% target attainment, is as follows:

The non-performance-related compensation comprises the fixed annual salary along with compensation
in kind and other benefits. The performance-related compensation partly comprises a variable compo-
nent (#)!), of which 50% takes the form of short-term variable cash compensation and 50% consists of
long-term cash compensation involving a grant of virtual Bayer shares that are retained for three years.
The other performance-related compensation component serving as a long-term incentive is the stock-
based cash compensation program Aspire. Here, a four-year retention period applies.

The members of the Board of Management also receive pension entitlements for themselves and their
surviving dependents.

Non-performance-related components

Fixed annual salary

The level of the non-performance-related, fixed annual salary takes into account the functions and
responsibilities assigned to the members of the Board of Management as well as market conditions.
The fixed salary is regularly reviewed by the Supervisory Board in light of the consumer price indexes
and adjusted if necessary. It is paid out in twelve monthly installments.

Compensation in kind and other benefits

This component mainly includes perquisites such as a company car with driver or the use of the
company carpool, payments toward the cost of security equipment, and the reimbursement of the cost
of annual health screening examinations. Compensation in kind and other benefits are reported at the
value assigned to them for tax purposes.

Performance-related components

Short-term variable cash compensation

The short-term variable compensation (short-term incentive, or #)!) is based on a set percentage of

the fixed annual salary (target value). This amount is adjusted according to the target attainments of the
Bayer Group, the subgroups and the individual Board of Management member.

The Group component is determined in relation to core earnings per share of the Group, while the
subgroup components are governed by the weighted average target attainments of the HealthCare,
CropScience and MaterialScience subgroups. The annual subgroup targets are derived from the
respective business strategies and operational priorities. The target attainment criteria for the sub-
groups were adjusted in January 2012. Whereas the target attainment for HealthCare and CropScience
is mainly based on the comparison of target and actual values for the &*!)’+ margin before special
items and sales growth, performance at MaterialScience is measured for this purpose by the cash flow
return on investment (CFROI). Through the end of 2011, the target attainment for all subgroups was
derived from the comparison of target and actual values for the &*!)’+_ margin before special items
and sales growth, along with supplementary qualitative criteria.

The target attainment for the individual component of the variable compensation is determined by the

Supervisory Board according to the performance of the individual Board of Management member. One
half of the #)! for each year is paid out in the second quarter of the following year, while the other half

is granted in the form of virtual Bayer shares.

Long-term variable cash compensation based on virtual Bayer shares

A cash payment with respect to the number of virtual shares held is made after three years according to
the market price of Bayer shares at that time. Both the number of virtual shares granted and the amount
of the payment at the end of the three-year period are based on the average official closing price of
Bayer shares over the last 30 trading days of the respective year in the Xetra system of the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange. In addition, they receive an amount equal to the total dividends paid on the equivalent
number of real shares during the period. Payment is made in January of the year following the end of the
three-year period. No option exists for the Board of Management members to extend the retention peri-
od or defer the payout.

Long-term stock-based cash compensation (Aspire I)

Members of the Board of Management are eligible to participate in the annual tranches of the long-term
stock-based compensation program Aspire ! (“Aspire”) on condition that they purchase a certain num-
ber of Bayer shares — determined for each individual according to specific guidelines — as a personal in-
vestment and for as long as they continue in the service of the Bayer Group. The payments made under
this program are based on the Aspire Target Opportunity, which is a contractually agreed percentage of
fixed annual salary. Depending on the performance of Bayer stock, both in absolute terms and relative
to the &'"(, #),-- 50 benchmark index, participants are granted an award of between 0% and 300% of
their individual Aspire Target Opportunity for four-year tranches, or between 0% and 200% for three-
year tranches, at the end of the respective performance period. The Aspire program was switched from
three- to four-year tranches starting in 2010 to increase its long-term incentive effect. For the transition
year 2010, a three-year half-tranche was issued in addition to the four-year tranche. Starting in 2011,
only tranches with a four-year performance period have been issued. The performance matrix and the
respective amounts of the awards depending on the absolute and relative performances of Bayer stock
are explained at.))/ ://000  .!12&#),( .*4+3&(.4,5 /&V#),46 4#),46 -/(,7(4+5# = /+4/1(&.

the member’s active service on the Board of Management during the period of the tranche; tranches
issued in 2012 or later are shortened according to the duration of the member’s active service on the
Board of Management during the first year of the tranche.

On top of the requirement for participants in the Aspire program to make a personal investment in Bayer
shares, the members of the Board of Management have undertaken to comply with expanded Share
Ownership Guidelines. These require the Chairman of the Board of Management to build a position in
Bayer shares to the value of 150% of his fixed annual salary, and the other members to the value of
100% of their fixed annual salaries, within four years and to continue to hold them for as long as they
remain Board of Management members. Half the number of virtual shares granted to them through con-
version of 50% of the #)! into virtual shares counts toward this position. The Board of Management
members must provide documentary evidence of their compliance with this obligation for the first time
at the end of the four-year position-building period and again yearly thereafter. In the event of signifi-
cant changes in fixed annual salary, the value to which shares are held must be adjusted accordingly.

Pension entitlements (retirement and surviving dependents’ pensions)

The currently serving members of the Board of Management are generally entitled to receive a lifelong
company pension after leaving the Bayer Group, though not before the age of 60. This pension is nor-
mally paid out in the form of a monthly life annuity. Dr. Dekkers has the option to receive a capital sum
in place of an annuity.

The annual pension granted equals at least 15% of final fixed annual salary. This percentage can in-
crease with continuing service on the Board of Management up to a maximum of 60%, except in the
case of amember appointed prior to 2006, who is entitled to a pension of up to 30% of his final fixed
annual salary. The arrangements for surviving dependents basically provide for a widow’s pension
amounting to 60% of the member's pension entitlement and an orphan’s pension amounting to 15%
of the member’s pension entitlement for each child.

Future pension payments are annually reviewed and adjusted based on the development of consumer
prices.

Pension rights are suspended if a Management Board member works for a competitor of Bayer AG or
of another Group company before the age of 65 without the prior written consent of the Supervisory
Board.

Benefits upon termination of service on the Board of Management

Severance payments

In line with the recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code, an entitlement to sever-
ance pay can only arise if a Board of Management member’s service contract is prematurely revoked by
the company without serious cause. In this event payments, including ancillary benefits, are limited to
the value of two years’ compensation (severance payment cap) and may not compensate more than the
remaining term of the contract. The severance payment cap is to be calculated on the basis of the fixed
salary plus the target value of the short-term variable compensation for the previous year and, where ap-
plicable, the expected aggregate compensation for the current year in addition. Compensation payments
for dismissal or severance payments are deducted from the annual pension on the basis of an equivalent
annuity amount calculated according to actuarial principles.

Post-contractual non-compete agreements

Post-contractual non-compete agreements exist with some of the members of the Board of Management,
providing for compensatory payments to be made by the company for the two-year duration of these
agreements. The post-contractual non-compete agreement that originally existed with Dr. Pott was can-
celled effective May 1, 2012 when his service contract was last renewed. For the members newly ap-
pointed to the Board of Management on or after January 1, 2010, the compensatory payment is 100%

of the average fixed salary for the twelve months preceding their departure. This amount is fully offset
against any severance payments or concurrent pension payments.

Change of control

Agreements exist with the members of the Board of Management providing for severance payments to
be made in certain circumstances in the event of a change in control. The amount of any possible sever-
ance payments in the case of early termination of service on the Board of Management as a result of a
change in control is limited to the value of three years’ compensation in line with the recommendation in
Section 4.2.3 of the German Corporate Governance Code. Such payments do not exceed the salary pay-
able for the remaining term of the service contract.
Unfitness for work

In the event of temporary unfitness for work, members of the Board of Management continue to receive
the contractually agreed compensation. Bayer AG may early terminate the service contract if the mem-
ber has been continuously unfit for work for at least 18 months and is likely to be permanently incapable
of fully performing his duties (permanent incapacity to work). A disability pension is paid in the event of
contract termination before the age of 60 due to permanent incapacity to work. The disability pension,
like the retirement pension, amounts to at least 15% of the final fixed salary and can increase with con-
tinuing service on the Board of Management up to a maximum of 60%.

COMPENSATION OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT IN 2012

The aggregate compensation of the members of the Board of Management in 2012 totaled €12,997 thou-
sand (2011: €11,155 thousand), comprising €3,541 thousand (2011: €3,396 thousand) in non-perfor-
mance-related components and €9,456 thousand (2011: €7,759 thousand) in performance-related com-
ponents. The pension service cost in 2012 amounted to €1,861 thousand (2011: €1,078 thousand). The
membership of the Board of Management during 2012 was unchanged from 2011.

4 Since 2010, Prof. Plischke and Dr. Pott have received one additional virtual Bayer share for every 20 virtual Bayer shares resulting from the conversion of 50% of the STI into virtual
Bayer shares to offset the effect of the change made to the system of variable cash compensation in 2010. This arrangement no longer applies to Dr. Pott under his new service contract

effective May 1, 2012.

Fixed annual salary
The fixed salaries of all the members of the Board of Management were adjusted in 2012 and totaled
€3,394 thousand (2011: €3,139 thousand).

Short-term variable cash compensation

The short-term variable cash compensation (short-term portion of the #)!) for all the members of the
Board of Management in 2012 totaled €4,247 thousand (2011: €3,379 thousand) after deduction of the
solidarity contribution. Under agreements reached with the employee representatives, all employees of
the companies covered by these agreements pay the solidarity contribution to help safeguard jobs at the
German sites. For 2012 this contribution amounted to 0.67% (2011: 0.91%) of each member’s total #)!
award.
Long-term variable cash compensation based on virtual Bayer shares

The conversion of 50% of the #)! into virtual Bayer shares was based on an average price of €70.26
(2011: €46.32). Professor Plischke and Dr. Pott receive one additional virtual Bayer share for every 20
virtual Bayer shares resulting from the conversion to offset the effect of the change made to the system
of variable cash compensation in 2010. This applies for the duration of the service contract in effect at
that time. The additional virtual shares are subject to the same retention period and therefore to the
same change in value. This arrangement no longer applies to Dr. Pott under his new service contract
effective May 1, 2012.

The long-term variable cash compensation based on virtual Bayer shares that is included in the
aggregate compensation according to the German Commercial Code was valued at €4,299 thousand
(2011: €3,445 thousand). The aggregate compensation according to the !%(#also includes a change of
€3,136 thousand (2011: minus €278 thousand) in the value of existing entitlements.

Provisions of €13,222 thousand (2011: €5,787 thousand) were established for the future cash dis-
bursements to currently serving members of the Board of Management based on the virtual Bayer
shares granted in the respective year. This amount also contains the dividend attributable to the
respective prior year.

Long-term stock-based cash compensation (Aspire)

The long-term stock-based cash compensation under the Aspire program is included in the

aggregate compensation according to the German Commercial Code at its fair value of €910 thousand
(2011: €935 thousand) at the grant date.

According to the !%(# the aggregate compensation includes the fair value of the partial entitlement
earned in the respective year. Grants of stock-based compensation with a four-year performance period
are therefore expensed at their respective fair values over four years starting with the grant year. The
aggregate compensation according to the !%(#also includes the change in the value of existing entitle-
ments under ongoing Aspire tranches granted in prior years.

13.2.2 Compensation of the Supervisory Board

The Supervisory Board is compensated according to the relevant provisions of the Articles of Incorpora-
tion, which were amended effective April 28, 2012 by resolution of the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting
held on April 27, 2012.

The compensation for 2012 is determined for the period through April 27 according to the previous
provisions and from April 28 according to the amended provisions. The compensation for 2013 and there-
after will be determined solely according to the amended provisions of the Articles of Incorporation.

SUPERVISORY BOARD COMPENSATION SYSTEM EFFECTIVE APRIL 28, 2012
The members of the Supervisory Board receive fixed annual compensation of €120,000 plus reimburse-
ment of their expenses.

In accordance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, additional
compensation is paid to the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board and for chairing and
membership of committees. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives fixed annual compensation of
€360,000, the Vice Chairman €240,000. These amounts also cover membership and chairmanship of com-
mittees. The other members receive additional compensation for committee membership. The chairman of
the Audit Committee receives an additional €120,000, the other members of the Audit Committee €60,000
each. The chairmen of the remaining committees receive €60,000 each, the other members of those com-
mittees €30,000 each. No additional compensation is paid for membership of the Nominations Committee.
A Supervisory Board member who is a member of more than two committees receives compensation only
for the two committees with the highest compensation. If changes are made to the Supervisory Board
and/or its committees during the year, members receive compensation on a pro-rated basis. The members
of the Supervisory Board also receive an attendance fee of €1,000 each time they personally attend a meet-
ing of the Supervisory Board or a committee. The attendance fee is limited to €1,000 per day.

In connection with the change in the Supervisory Board compensation system decided by the 2012
Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, the members holding office effective April 28, 2012 have given a volun-
tary pledge that they will each purchase Bayer shares for 25% of their fixed compensation, including
any compensation for committee membership (before taxes), and hold these shares for as long as they
remain members of the Supervisory Board. This does not apply to members who transfer at least 85%
of their fixed compensation to the Hans Bockler Foundation in accordance with the rules of the German
Trade Union Confederation or whose service or employment contract with a company requires them to
transfer such compensation to that company. If less than 85% of the fixed compensation is transferred,
the voluntary pledge applies to the portion not transferred. By voluntarily pledging to invest in and hold
Bayer shares, the Supervisory Board members reinforce their interest in the long-term, sustainable
success of the company. With respect to the fiscal year 2012, the voluntary pledge applies to the fixed
compensation paid for the period from April 28, 2012.

SUPERVISORY BOARD COMPENSATION SYSTEM UNTIL APRIL 27, 2012

Until April 27, 2012, the compensation of the Supervisory Board was based on the relevant provisions

of the Articles of Incorporation decided by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 29, 2005. Each
member of the Supervisory Board received fixed annual compensation of €60,000 plus reimbursement of
their expenses and a variable annual compensation component. The variable component was based on
corporate performance in terms of the gross cash flow reported in the consolidated financial statements
of the Bayer Group for the respective fiscal year. The members of the Supervisory Board received €2,000
for every €50 million or part thereof by which the gross cash flow exceeded €3.1 billion, but the variable
component for each member could not exceed €30,000.

In accordance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, additional
compensation was paid to the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board and for chairing
and membership of committees. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board received three times the basic
compensation, while the Vice Chairman received one-and-a-half times the basic compensation. Mem-
bers of the Supervisory Board who were also members of a committee received an additional one quar-
ter of the amount, with those chairing a committee receiving a further quarter. However, no member of

the Sunervisarv Raard received tatal camnensation exceedina three times the hasic camnensation It
Committee. If changes were made to the Supervisory Board or its committees during the fiscal year,
members received compensation on a pro-rated basis.

EMPLOYEE DATA

On December 31, 2012, the Bayer Group had 110,500 employees worldwide (2011: 111,800). Thus head-
count showed a slight decline of 1.2% from the prior year. In Germany we had 34,600 employees (2011:
35,800), making up 31.3% of the Group workforce. HealthCare had 55,300 employees (2011: 55,700),
CropScience 20,800 (2011: 21,000), and MaterialScience 14,500 (2011: 14,800). The remaining 19,900
(2011: 20,300) employees worked mainly for the service companies. This figure also includes the 700
(2011: 700) employees of Bayer AG. There were an additional 2,500 (2011: 2,500) trainees on the closing
date who are not included in the above numbers.

Personnel expenses rose in 2012 by 5.5% to €9,203 million (2011: €8,726 million), chiefly as a result of
currency effects, higher employee bonuses and the regular salary increases.

SUSTAINABLE HUMAN RESOURCES POLICY

The Bayer Group’s human resources policy is based on its globally valid !"#$ values. !"#$ stands for
Leadership, Integrity, Flexibility and Efficiency. These corporate values commit us to a sustainable hu-
man resources policy that is strongly oriented toward performance, development and a high degree of
social responsibility. To emphasize their importance as a framework for our employees’ behavior, we
have permanently integrated the !"#$ values into our global performance management system starting
in 2012. Now, one of the assessment criteria for all managerial employees is the extent to which they
apply the four corporate values in the pursuit of their career goals.

A COMMITTED WORKFORCE

In 2012 we gained important responses and information on the current perception within the company
of our strategy, culture and working conditions from the second Group-wide employee survey, in which,
once again, more than 70% of our global workforce participated. This survey provides us with periodic
feedback from our employees on a number of topics, at the same time benchmarking us against other
companies. Based on the survey results, we implement suitable improvement measures and subsequent-
ly monitor the progress made. The results again confirmed that the overwhelming majority of the em-
ployees identify with our company and its values, and are highly committed to ensuring the company’s
success.

Among the main facets of our human resources policy is our Group-wide talent management — the mea-
sures and tools to further our employees’ professional and personal development. Last year we estab-
lished the Bayer Global Internal Job Board to better enable our employees to exploit career opportuni-
ties and help them actively shape their own career development within the enterprise. Since then, vacant
positions up to and including senior management have been advertised internally throughout the Group
on this globally accessible job platform. In this way, employees can obtain a clear overview of the inter-
nal job market and directly apply for interesting positions across the organization for which they are
suitably qualified.

To strengthen the Leadership component of !"#$ and promote performance orientation in the company,
we have developed an innovative training program that will support our managers in regularly giving
their employees candid, constructive feedback on their work and conduct. The goal is to establish a true
feedback culture throughout the enterprise that promotes individual strengths, addresses existing defi-
cits and thus enhances employees’ personal and professional development over the long term. All mem-
bers of the Group Leadership Circle - the company’s top management level — took the training program
at the start, and about 11,000 other managers at all levels followed in 2012.

ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE AND LEADERSHIP SKILLS

Providing training for our employees is fundamental both to talent management and to addressing the
consequences of demographic change. In 2012 we maintained our offering of advanced training courses
for employees at a high level worldwide and added a number of new features. Our successful “Pegasus”
online training program about safety in the workplace was again used more than 36,000 times, and a to-
tal of over 28,000 — mainly managerial — employees have now completed our online training program on
corporate compliance.

We supplemented our management training programs on strategic corporate development with a new
workshop format entitled “Leading Innovation” to promote individual innovative expertise. We added
this element in light of the fact that innovation, along with feedback and diversity, is among the central
components of Bayer’s high-performance culture. In this series of seminars, the members of the Group
Leadership Circle and selected other executives receive training in the strategies and methods behind
effective innovation management. Also in 2012, we developed a concept for a Group-wide Bayer Acade-
my to be launched in 2013 with the aim of instilling a uniform leadership mindset within the enterprise
and systematically improving the existing employee training programs.

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

An important principle of our human resources policy is to link employees’ compensation to their perfor-
mance and enable them to share in the company’s success. Regular benchmarking against competitors
and a globally standardized system help us to set base salaries in line with the demands and responsibil-
ities of each position. These salaries are supplemented by performance-related compensation compo-
nents and extensive ancillary benefits.

More than €700 million is earmarked for variable bonus awards to employees for the year 2012 under
the Group-wide short-term incentive (%&"program alone. Included in our extensive range of ancillary
benefits in many countries are various stock participation programs that enable employees to purchase
Bayer stock at a discount, giving them an additional opportunity to share in the company’s economic
success. We also offer senior and middle managers throughout the Group uniform stock-based compen-
sation programs known as “Aspire” (see Note [26.6] to the consolidated financial statements) that are
based on ambitious earnings targets and — in the case of Group Leadership Circle members — require an
appropriate personal investment in Bayer stock.

SOCIAL PROTECTION AND RESPONSIBILITY

Sustainability and social responsibility are also reflected in our approach to necessary changes and re-
structuring measures. For example, the workforce reduction initiated in November 2010 was implement-
ed on schedule by the end of 2012 in ways that minimized social hardship. In Germany, which remains
the company’s largest operational base with 34,600 employees, business-related dismissals are excluded
through the end of 2015 for the great majority of employees under an agreement with the employee rep-
resentatives that was again renewed at the end of 2011. As shown by the employee survey results, our
social commitment is acknowledged by the great majority of the employees as an important part of our
corporate strategy.

This aspect of our human resources policy includes ensuring a high level of social protection. For exam-
ple, nearly all Group employees either have statutory health insurance or can obtain health insurance
through the company, and 66% have access to a company pension plan. The working conditions for
53% of our employees are governed by collective or company agreements. In China, the establishment
of unionized employee councils, begun in 1997, continued in 2012. Eleven companies with a total of
over 10,000 employees now have elected councils, which means that more than 90% of our employees
in China are now represented by the local union.

Our mission as a responsible employer also includes safeguarding and promoting our employees’ health.
In all the countries in which we operate, we provide benefits such as medical checkups, on-site medical
services, sports opportunities inside and outside the company, and advice and reintegration assistance
after recovery from an illness. In this way we also contribute significantly to maintaining long-term em-
ployability. This is of growing importance as many countries are raising the retirement age in light of de-
mographic change.
DIVERSITY AND INTERNATIONALITY

A diverse employee structure is crucial to our company’s future competitiveness. This applies
particularly to our Group-wide management team, because diversity helps us to better understand
changing markets and consumer groups, gives us access to a larger talent pool and enables us to ben-
efit from the increased problem-solving and innovation capability that has a proven link with high
cultural diversity within the company. We pursue this aim especially in the emerging markets of Asia
and Latin America, where we intend to significantly increase the proportion of local people among our
managerial employees in the medium term. Of the members of our Group Leadership Circle, in which
23 nationalities are currently represented, some 67% are native to the country in which they work.
The Bayer Group currently employs people from 136 countries.

Another focus of our diversity strategy is to improve the balance between women and men, particularly
among managerial staff. We view a gender balance spectrum of between 30 to 70 and 70 to 30 as ac-
ceptable. We have therefore set ourselves the voluntary target of raising the proportion of women in the
five highest management grade levels throughout the Group toward 30% by 2015. In 2012, women
accounted for 23% and men for 77% of employees in this management segment. The ratio of female to
male employees in the Bayer Group as a whole was 36% to 64%. We are holding workshops aimed at
heightening managers’ awareness for the benefits of greater employee diversity so that people can pur-
sue a successful career in the company and take advantage of Bayer’s executive advancement programs
regardless of gender, nationality and other affiliations. The first 24 management teams participated in
diversity workshops in 2012.

VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND RECRUITING

As an employer, Bayer endeavors to appeal to the best and most talented people worldwide and to retain
employees for long periods by providing good development opportunities, a modern working environ-
ment and competitive compensation. In 2012 we again succeeded in attracting a total of more than
4,600 academically qualified specialists and managers worldwide. We recruited approximately 700 uni-
versity graduates in Brazil, more than 600 in India and about 400 each in China, Germany and Russia. In
2012 we hired more than 17,000 new people across all occupations throughout the Group. In addition,
we provided some 3,800 challenging occupational internships to talented young students worldwide to
give them insight into the variety of career opportunities at Bayer while they are still studying. Such
young people often return to us as employees at a later date.

Apart from the hiring of university graduates, our own training programs for young people are among
the most important steps we take to guard against a possible shortage of specialists due to demographic
change. Once again in 2012, more than 900 young people entered training programs in a total of over 30
occupations at our German sites. In China, we agreed to extend the vocational training collaboration
forged in 2002 with the Shanghai Petrochemical Academy for a further ten years. In 2012 some 40
young people embarked on a multi-stage training program that will give them the skills they need for
jobs at our sites in China.
In 2012 the foundation presented the €35,000 “Aspirin Social Award” for innovative health care aid and
consultancy programs in Germany for the third time.

Bayer donated a total of some ’%$280,000 to the American Red Cross and the Save the Children Fund
for victims of Hurricane Sandy in the northeastern United States. The Bayer Cares Foundation has joined
with the aid organization Dawn Relief and ’(")$# to launch a long-term reconstruction project in the
region of Pakistan affected by the severe floods of 2010. The foundation is providing €100,000 for the
construction of some 60 single-family homes, a school and a vocational training center.

SPORTS AND CULTURE

The Bayer Arts s Culture program and our other special-interest clubs have contributed to the attrac-
tiveness of our corporate locations for more than a century, benefiting employees and other citizens
alike. In 2012, the company provided funding of some €13 million for recreational, youth and disabled
sports. Bayer also continued with its “Simply Soccer” integration project in conjunction with the
German Soccer Federation (*#+), enabling some 200 girls and boys with mental or learning disabilities
to regularly play soccer in 13 ordinary clubs.

16. Events After the End of the Reporting Period

HEALTHCARE

In January 2013, we acquired the ’ .% animal health business of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.,
United States. The purchase price is comprised of a one-time payment of €40 million plus potential
milestone payments totaling up to €69 million that are linked to the successful and timely achievement
of manufacturing and sales targets.

CROPSCIENCE

In January 2013, CropScience acquired ,-./0&1 Biologischer Pflanzenschutz GmbH, a leading suppli-
er of biological crop protection products headquartered in Malchow, Germany. The acquisition com-
prises ultra-modern production and formulation plants along with research and development facilities.
This acquisition strengthens the successful fruit and vegetables business of CropScience. The provi-
sional purchase price was €25 million.

mClearly structured risk management organization

17.1.1 Opportunity and Risk Management

Business operations necessarily involve opportunities and risks. Effective management of opportunities
and risks is therefore a key factor in sustainably safeguarding a company’s value.

Managing opportunities and risks is an integral part of the corporate governance system in place
throughout the Bayer Group, not the task of one particular organizational unit. Key elements of the op-
portunity and risk management system are the planning and controlling process, Group regulations and
the reporting system.

The opportunity and risk situation is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively in determining the
strategies of the strategic business entities and the regions. At regular conferences held to discuss busi-
ness performance, the results of this evaluation are updated to form the basis for setting risk manage-
ment objectives and taking the necessary actions.

Opportunity management in the Bayer Group is based on the detailed observation and analysis of
individual markets and the early recognition and evaluation of trends from which opportunities can be
identified. Macroeconomic, industry-specific, regional and local trends are taken into account. It is the
task of the subgroups and strategic business entities to make use of strategic opportunities arising in
their respective markets. The strategic framework necessary for them to do this is set, and the neces-
sary financing and liquidity ensured, at the Group level. Opportunity-based projects involving more
than one subgroup are centrally coordinated and accounted for.

The principles behind the Bayer Group’s risk management system are contained in a directive published
on the Group-wide intranet. The directive describes the relevant statutory requirements and how Bayer
identifies risks at an early stage, communicates them and takes steps to mitigate them.

Risk management at the Group level is assigned to the Chief Financial Officer. The subgroups, service
companies and the units of the holding company have nominated persons responsible for risk manage-
ment at the upper managerial level as well as risk management coordinators to ensure that an effective
system for the early identification of risks is implemented and maintained. The annual risk report to the
Supervisory Board covers the risk management system, legal risks, compliance issues, the reports by
Corporate Auditing and the report on the internal control system. The members of the Group Leadership
Circle have unrestricted access to the risk database, which is mapped to the management information

system.
The effectiveness of the risk management system is monitored by Corporate Auditing at regular inter-
vals. Corporate Auditing adopts a risk-based approach to audit planning. In addition, the external audi-
tor assesses the early warning system as part of the annual financial statements audit and informs the
Group Management Board and the Supervisory Board of the findings. These findings are taken into
account as part of the continuous enhancement of our risk management system. The risk management
system is monitored by the Supervisory Board, especially its Audit Committee.

17.1.2 Internal Control and Risk Management System for (Group)

Accounting and Financial Reporting
(report pursuant to Sections 289 Paragraph 5 and 315 Paragraph 2 No. 5 of the
German Commercial Code)

Bayer has an internal control and risk management system in place under which appropriate structures
and processes for (Group) accounting and financial reporting are defined and implemented throughout
the organization. This system is designed to guarantee timely, uniform and accurate accounting for

all business processes and transactions. It ensures compliance with statutory regulations, accounting
and financial reporting standards and the internal accounting directive, which is binding upon all the
companies included in the consolidated financial statements. The relevance and consequences for the
consolidated financial statements of any amendments to laws, accounting or financial reporting stan-
dards or other pronouncements are continually analyzed, and the Group directives and systems are
updated accordingly.

Apart from defined control mechanisms such as system-based and manual reconciliation processes,
the fundamental principles of the internal control system include the separation of functions and com-
pliance with directives and operating procedures. The accounting and financial reporting process for
the Bayer Group is managed by the Group Accounting and Controlling department of Bayer AG.

The Group companies prepare their financial statements either locally or using the Group’s shared ser-
vice centers and transmit them with the aid of a data model that is standardized throughout the Group
and based on the Group accounting directive. The Group companies are responsible for their compli-
ance with the directives and procedures applicable throughout the Group and for the proper and timely
operation of their accounting-related processes and systems. The employees involved in the accounting
and financial reporting process for the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group and the
financial statements of Bayer AG receive regular training, and the Group companies are supported by
headquarters personnel throughout the process. As part of the process, measures are implemented that
are designed to ensure the regulatory compliance of the consolidated financial statements. These mea-
sures serve to identify and evaluate risks, and to limit and monitor any risks that may be identified. For
example, material new contractual relationships are systematically tracked and analyzed.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared centrally on the basis of the data supplied by the in-
cluded subsidiaries. The consolidation, certain reconciliation operations and monitoring of the related
time schedules and procedures are performed by a dedicated Group Financial Statements department.
System-based controls are monitored by personnel and supplemented by manual inspection. At least
one additional check by a second person is carried out at every level. Defined approval procedures
must be observed at all stages in the accounting process. There is also a dedicated unit, separate from
the financial statements preparation process, for clarification of specific accounting-related questions
or particularly complex issues.
O SEE CHAPTER 3

inal SEE CHAPTER 11

Bayer’s internal control system for financial reporting is based on the framework issued by !"#" (Com-
mittee of the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission). For $%processes, the !"&$%(Con-
trol Objectives for Information and Related Technology) framework is used accordingly. The standards
for the mandatory Group-wide internal control system ($!#) were derived from these frameworks, de-
fined centrally and implemented by the Group companies. The management of each company is respon-
sible for the implementation and oversight of the local $!#. All $!#-relevant business processes, together
with the related risks and controls, are documented in a uniform and audit-proof manner in a Group-
wide system and clearly mapped in a central $%ystem at the Group level.

Bayer’s Corporate Audit Department performs an independent and objective audit function designed to
verify compliance with statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements. Its activities are aimed at en-
suring that resources and corporate assets are adequately protected and that significant financial and
other operating information is accurate, reliable, and furnished in a timely manner. Corporate Auditing
supports the company in achieving its goals by objectively evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of
management and monitoring processes and of the risk management and internal control systems, and
helping to improve them based on a systematic and targeted approach. Its scope extends to all the com-
pany’s activities worldwide.

Bayer AG has a standardized, Group-wide procedure to monitor the efficacy of the accounting-related
internal control system. This procedure is aligned to potential misreporting risks in the consolidated
financial statements.

The appraisal of the effectiveness of the accounting-related $!# is based on a cascaded self-assessment
system that starts with the persons directly involved in the process, then involves the principal responsi-
ble managers and ends with the Group Management Board. Corporate Auditing performs an indepen-
dent review of random samples of these self-assessments.

The Group Management Board has examined the effectiveness of the internal control system for
accounting and financial reporting. The examination confirmed the functionality of this internal control
system for fiscal 2012. The effectiveness of the internal control system is monitored by the Audit Com-
mittee of the Bayer AG Supervisory Board in compliance with the German Accounting Law Moderniza-
tion Act, which came into effect in May 2009. However, it should be noted that an internal control
system, irrespective of its design, cannot provide absolute assurance that material misstatements in the
accounting will be avoided or identified.

17.1.3 Opportunities

As an international enterprise, Bayer is subject to a wide variety of developments in the national and
international markets in which its three subgroups operate. Different potential risks and opportunities
arise within the existing operational framework based on the business development described in this
report and the company’s overall situation.

We aim to take maximum advantage of the opportunities occurring in our various fields of activity. We
continuously evaluate potential additional opportunities in all areas as an integral part of our strategy,
which is set forth in detail in Chapter 3 “Strategy.”

Further opportunities derive from the company’s innovation capability, and we are working continuously
to find new products and improve existing ones. These activities are presented in detail in Chapter 11
“Research, Development, Innovation.”
. . . . . . . SEE CHAPTER 6.5
We also believe that the emerging markets hold further potential. More information on our business in O

these countries is provided in Chapter 6.5 “Business Development in the Emerging Markets.”

Various risks described in the following — particularly financial risks — are counterbalanced by the
opportunities that could result from positive trends.

17.1.4 Risks

RISK EXPOSURE

As a global company with a diverse business portfolio, the Bayer Group is exposed to numerous risks.
We have purchased insurance coverage — where it is available on economically acceptable terms — in
order to minimize related financial impacts. The level of this coverage is continuously re-examined.

Significant risks for the Bayer Group are outlined in the following sections. The order in which the risks
are listed is not intended to imply any assessment as to the likelihood of their materialization or the ex-
tent of any resulting damages.

LEGAL RISKS

The Bayer Group is exposed to numerous legal risks from legal disputes or proceedings to which we are
currently a party or which could arise in the future, particularly in the areas of product liability, competi-
tion and antitrust law, patent disputes, tax assessments and environmental matters. The outcome of any
current or future proceedings cannot be predicted. It is therefore possible that legal or regulatory judg-
ments could give rise to expenses that are not covered, or not fully covered, by insurers’ compensation
payments and could significantly affect our revenues and earnings.

Investigations into possible legal or regulatory violations, such as potential infringements of antitrust law
or certain marketing and/or distribution methods, may result in civil or criminal sanctions — including
substantial monetary penalties — and/or other adverse financial consequences, may harm Bayer's repu-
tation and ultimately detract from the company’s success.

To ensure that laws and regulations are observed, Bayer has established a global corporate compliance
program that forms an integral part of its corporate culture. This program comprises the Corporate Com-
pliance Policy, which serves as the framework for the observance of laws and regulations, a dedicated SEE

compliance organization and intensive communication and training activities. CONSOLIDATED

CHAPTER 17.2

INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC RISKS

Pharmaceutical product prices are subject to regulatory controls in many markets. Some governments
intervene directly in setting prices. In addition, in some markets major purchasers of pharmaceutical
products have the economic power to exert substantial pressure on prices. Price controls, as well as
price pressure from generic manufacturers as a result of government reimbursement systems favoring
less expensive generic pharmaceuticals over brand-name products, diminish earnings from our phar-
maceutical products and could potentially render the market introduction of a new product unprofit-
able. We expect the current extent of regulatory controls and market pressures on pricing to persist or
increase. Changes regarding governmental price controls in our key markets are continuously moni-
tored. If necessary, we adjust our business plans depending on the extent of such price controls.

The Group’s sales and earnings are affected by the economic circumstances of our customers.
At MaterialScience, a downturn in the business cycle would result in weak demand and overcapacities,
putting pressure on prices and heightening competition.

The early identification of trends in the economic or regulatory environment and active portfolio man-
agement are important elements of our business management. Our analyses of the global economy and
forecasts of medium-term economic development are documented in detail on a quarterly basis and
used to support operational business planning. However, even our detailed analyses may not ensure
that a massive economic downturn can be predicted.

For a summary forecast, see Chapter 17.2 “Economic Outlook.”

Where it appears strategically advantageous, we may acquire a company or part of a company and
combine it with our existing business. The amount of goodwill and other intangible assets reflected in
the Bayer Group’s consolidated statement of financial position has increased significantly in recent
years as a result of acquisitions. Failure to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or unex-
pectedly high integration costs could jeopardize the achievement of quantitative or qualitative targets,
such as synergies, and adversely impact earnings.

The integration processes associated with our acquisitions are steered by integration teams. Suitably
experienced personnel resources are provided to support the integration processes. Teams of experts
also provide support for any divestiture projects.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT RISKS

The Bayer Group’s competitive position, sales and earnings depend significantly on the development of
commercially viable new products and production technologies. We therefore devote substantial re-
sources to research and development. Because of the lengthy development processes, technological
challenges, regulatory requirements and intense competition, we cannot assure that all of the products
we will develop in the future or are currently developing will actually reach the market and achieve
commercial success as scheduled or at all.

In addition, adverse effects of our products that may be discovered after regulatory approval or regis-
tration despite thorough prior testing may lead to a partial or complete withdrawal from the market,
due either to regulatory actions or our voluntary decision to stop marketing a product. Also litigations
and associated claims for damages due to negative effects of our products may materially diminish our
earnings.

To ensure an effective and efficient use of resources in research and development, the Bayer Group has
implemented an organizational structure and process organization comprising functional departments,
working groups and reporting systems that monitor development projects.
REGULATORY RISKS

Our life-science businesses, in particular, are subject to strict regulatory regimes relating to the testing,
manufacturing and marketing of many of our products. In some countries, regulatory controls have be-
come increasingly demanding. We expect this trend to continue. Increasing regulatory requirements,
such as those governing clinical or (eco-)toxicological studies, may increase product development costs
and/or delay product (re-)registration.

To counter risks arising from legal or other requirements, we make our decisions and engineer our
business processes on the basis of comprehensive legal advice provided both by our own experts and by
acknowledged external specialists. Projects have been initiated to coordinate the implementation of new
regulatory controls and mitigate any negative implications for the business.

PATENT RISKS

A large proportion of our products, mainly in our life-science businesses, is protected by patents. We are
currently involved in lawsuits to enforce patent rights in our products. Generic manufacturers and others
attempt to contest patents prior to their expiration. Sometimes a generic version of a product may even
be launched “at-risk” prior to the issuance of a final patent decision.

When a patent defense is unsuccessful, or if one of our patents expires, our prices are likely to come
under pressure because of increased competition from generic products entering the market. Details of
related litigation are provided as part of the description of legal risks in Note [32] to the consolidated
financial statements.

In some areas of activity we may also be required to defend ourselves against charges that products
infringe patent or proprietary rights of third parties. This could impede or even halt the development or
manufacturing of certain products or require us to pay monetary damages or royalties to third parties.

Our life-science businesses, in particular, have a comprehensive product life-cycle management system
in place. In addition, our patents department, in conjunction with the relevant functional departments,
regularly reviews the patent situation. Potential infringements of our patents by other companies are
carefully monitored so that legal action can be taken if necessary.

PRODUCTION, PROCUREMENT MARKET AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS

Production capacities at some of our manufacturing facilities could be adversely affected by events
such as technical failures, natural disasters, regulatory rulings or disruptions to supplies of key raw
materials or intermediates, as in the case of dependence on a single source for critical materials. This
applies particularly to our biotech products because of the highly complex manufacturing processes.
If in such cases we are unable to meet demand by shifting sufficient production to other plants or
drawing on our inventories, we may suffer declines in sales revenues.

FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Note [32]
Long-term supply
contracts to hedge
against raw material
price risks

The supply of strategically important raw materials is ensured wherever possible through long-term
contracts and/or by purchasing from multiple suppliers. Furthermore, all stages of our production
processes and our material inputs are continuously monitored by the respective expert function within
the company.

The manufacturing of chemical products is subject to risks associated with the production, filling, stor-
age and transportation of raw materials, products and waste. These risks may result in personal injury,
property damage, environmental contamination, production stoppages, business interruptions and liabil-
ity for compensation payments.

The presence of unintended trace amounts of genetically modified organisms in agricultural products
and/or foodstuffs cannot be completely excluded.

We address product and environmental risks by adopting suitable quality assurance measures. An inte-
grated quality, health, environmental and safety management system ensures process stability. Our sus-
tainability strategy and sustainability management are driven by our commitment to the international
Responsible Care and Global Product Strategy initiatives of the chemical industry.

PERSONNEL RISKS

Skilled and dedicated employees are essential for the success of our growth-oriented corporate strate-
gy. Particularly in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America, the number of people with the
technical and language skills needed for demanding positions in an international industrial enterprise
remains relatively small. Accordingly, those who possess these skills are highly sought after by
companies operating there. Should we be unable to recruit a sufficient number of employees in these
countries and retain them for the long term, this could have considerable adverse consequences for
our future success.

We are addressing this risk by globally positioning the company as an attractive employer and carry-
ing out comprehensive personnel marketing to convince our target groups of the benefits of working
for Bayer. These include competitive compensation with performance-related components as well as
an extensive range of training and development opportunities. We also pursue a diversity-based hu-
man resources policy to tap the full potential of the employment market.

IT RISKS

Business and production processes and the internal and external communications of the Bayer Group
are increasingly dependent on information technology systems. Major disruptions or failure of global or
regional business systems may result in loss of data and/or impairment of business and production
processes.

The foundations for a continuous and sustainable $%isk management system have been laid by estab-
lishing a comprehensive organization, issuing regulations that define the relevant roles and responsibil-
ities, and implementing a periodic reporting system. For this purpose a committee has been estab-
lished at the Group level to resolve upon the basic strategy, architecture and $%ecurity features, which
are implemented accordingly by the subgroups and service companies in consultation with this central
organization. Technical precautions such as data recovery and continuity plans have been established
together with our internal $%ervice provider to address this risk.
RISK TO PENSION OBLIGATIONS FROM CAPITAL MARKET DEVELOPMENTS

The Bayer Group has obligations to current and former employees related to pensions and other post-
employment benefits. Changes in relevant valuation parameters such as interest rates, mortality and
rates of increases in compensation may raise the present value of our pension obligations. This may
lead to increased costs for pension plans or diminish equity due to actuarial losses being recognized
directly in equity. A large proportion of our pension and other post-employment benefit obligations is
covered by plan assets including fixed-income securities, shares, real estate and other investments.
Declining or even negative returns on these investments may adversely affect the future fair value of
plan assets. This in turn may diminish equity, and/or it may necessitate additional contributions by the
company. Further details are given in Note [25] to the consolidated financial statements.

We address the risk of market-related fluctuations in the fair value of our plan assets through prudent
strategic investment, and we constantly monitor investment risks in regard to our global pension
obligations.

FINANCIAL RISKS

Management of financial and commodity price risks

As a global enterprise, Bayer is exposed in the normal course of business to credit risks, liquidity risks
and various market price risks that may materially affect its net assets, financial position and results of
operations.

In line with company policy, a central risk management process is applied to identify and analyze the
market price risks arising from operating activities and from the resulting financing requirements. Our
use of derivatives to eliminate or minimize these risks relates almost entirely to hedge recorded or fore-
casted transactions and is subject to strict internal controls based on centrally defined mechanisms and
uniform guidelines. The derivatives used are mainly over-the-counter instruments, particularly forward
exchange contracts, foreign currency options, interest-rate swaps, cross-currency interest-rate swaps,
commodity swaps and commodity option contracts concluded with banks. We set counterparty limits for
such banks depending on their creditworthiness. Further details on derivatives are given in Note [30.3].

The following section explains the various risks associated with financial instruments and how these
risks are managed.

Credit and country risks

Credit risks arise from the possibility of the value of receivables or other financial assets being im-
paired because counterparties cannot meet their payment or other performance obligations. The
Bayer Group does not conclude master netting arrangements with its customers for non-derivative
financial instruments; here, the total of financial assets represents the maximum credit risk exposure.
In the case of derivatives, positive and negative market values may be netted under certain conditions.

To effectively manage the credit risks from trade receivables, Bayer has put in place a standardized
risk management system, which is the subject of a Group directive. Each invoicing company has ap-
pointed a responsible credit manager who regularly analyzes customers’ creditworthiness. Some of
these receivables are collateralized, and the collateral is used according to local conditions. It includes
credit insurance, advance payments, letters of credit and guarantees. Reservation of title is generally

agreed with our customers. Credit limits are set for all customers. All credit limits for debtors where
total exposure is €10 million or more are evaluated by local credit management and submitted to the
Group’s Central Financial Risk Committee.

To minimize credit risks, financial transactions are only conducted within predefined exposure limits
and with banks and other partners that have investment-grade ratings. All risk limits are based on me-
thodical models. Adherence to the risk limits is continuously monitored.

Country risks relating to trade receivables, intra-Group loans and the creditworthiness of the countries
themselves are continuously monitored, systematically evaluated and centrally managed.

Liquidity risks

Liquidity risks — those arising from the possibility of not being able to meet current or future payment
obligations because insufficient cash is available — are centrally managed in the Bayer Group. The Group
holds sufficient liquidity to ensure the fulfillment of all planned payment obligations at maturity. Pay-
ment obligations result both from operating cash flows and from changes in current financial liabilities.
In addition, a reserve is maintained for unbudgeted shortfalls in cash receipts or unexpected disburse-
ments. For this purpose, budget deviation analyses are performed on the basis of historical time series,
adjusted for variations in business structure. The liquidity reserve is then determined which, with a de-
fined probability, will cover a negative deviation from budgeted cash flows. The size of this reserve is
regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary to current conditions. Liquid assets are held mainly in the
form of overnight and term deposits. Credit facilities also exist with banks. These include, in particular, a
€3.5 billion syndicated credit facility, which is undrawn.

We intend to service the bonds maturing in 2013 out of liquidity and free operating cash flow.

Market risks

Market risks relate to the possibility that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments may
fluctuate due to variations in market prices. They include currency, interest-rate and other price risks,
especially commodity price risks. We estimate market price risks by performing a sensitivity analysis
for each category (such as interest rates) on the basis of hypothetical changes in risk variables (such as
interest curves) to determine the potential effects of market price fluctuations on equity and earnings.
We employ sensitivity analysis because it provides readily understandable risk estimates using straight-
forward assumptions (for example, an increase in interest rates). We continue to use market informa-
tion and additional analytics to manage our risk exposure and mitigate the limitations of our sensitivity
analysis. The assumptions and parameters used in sensitivity analysis are regularly reviewed. The
sensitivity analyses provided in the following sections relate to the hypothetical loss in cash flows from
the derivative and non-derivative financial instruments that we held as of December 31, 2012 and
December 31, 2011. The range of sensitivities that we chose for these analyses reflects our view of the
changes in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates that are reasonably possible
over a one-year period.
Currency risks

Since the Bayer Group conducts a significant portion of its operations outside the eurozone, fluctuations
in currency exchange rates can materially affect earnings. Currency risks from financial instruments
exist with respect to receivables, payables, cash and cash equivalents that are not denominated ina
company’s functional currency. In the Bayer Group these risks are particularly significant for the’ .#.
dollar, the Japanese yen, the Canadian dollar and the Chinese renminbi.

Recorded operating items, receivables and payables in liquid foreign currencies are normally fully
hedged.

The anticipated foreign currency exposure from forecasted transactions in the next twelve months is
hedged on a basis agreed between the Group Management Board, the central finance department and
the operating units. A significant proportion of contractual and foreseeable currency risks is hedged,
mainly through forward exchange contracts and currency options.

We applied a hypothetical adverse scenario in which the euro simultaneously depreciates by 10%
against all other currencies compared with the year-end exchange rates. Under this scenario the esti-
mated hypothetical loss of cash flows from derivative and non-derivative financial instruments as of
December 31, 2012 would be €256 million (December 31, 2011: €305 million). Of this €256 million,
€127 million is related to the’ .#. dollar, €32 million to the Japanese yen, €31 million to the Canadian
dollar and €66 million to other currencies. Of the €256 million estimated hypothetical loss of cash flow,
€296 million results from derivatives used to hedge anticipated exposure from planned sales denomi-
nated in foreign currencies. Such transactions qualify for hedge accounting, and the respective chang-
es in value are recognized in equity under other comprehensive income ("!$). The offsetting position of
€40 million is primarily attributable to account balances in foreign currencies.

Interest-rate risks

The Bayer Group’s interest-rate risks arise primarily from financial assets and liabilities with maturities
exceeding one year. In the case of fixed-rate financial instruments, such as fixed-rate bonds, the risk of
fluctuations in capital-market interest rates results in a fair-value risk because the fair values fluctuate as
a function of interest rates. In the case of floating-rate instruments, a cash flow risk exists because inter-
est payments could increase or decrease in the future.

Interest-rate risks are managed via the duration set by the Board of Management, which implicitly also
includes the ratio of fixed-rate to floating-rate debt. The duration is subject to regular review. Derivatives
— mainly interest-rate swaps, cross-currency interest-rate swaps and interest options — are employed to
preserve the target structure of the portfolio.
Financial liabilities including derivatives as of December 31, 2012 amounted to €9,528 million (Decem-
ber 31, 2011: €11,663 million). The sensitivity analysis was performed on the basis of our floating-rate
debt position at year end 2012, taking into account the interest rates relevant to our liabilities in all
principal currencies. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point, in these inter-
est rates (assuming constant currency exchange rates) as of January 1, 2012 would have raised our
interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 by €46 million (2011 based on our floating-rate
debt position at year end 2011: €68 million).

Other price risks (especially commodity price risks)

The Bayer Group requires significant quantities of petrochemical feedstocks and energy for its various
production processes. The prices of these inputs may fluctuate considerably depending on market
conditions. As in the past, there may be times when it is not possible for us to pass on increased raw
material costs to customers through price adjustments. This applies particularly to our MaterialScience
business.

We have addressed this risk by concluding long-term contracts with multiple suppliers. The procure-
ment departments of the subgroups are responsible for managing commodity price risks on the basis of
centrally set requirements and limits. The operation of our production facilities requires large amounts
of energy, mostly in the form of electricity and steam. To minimize our exposure to energy price fluctua-
tions, we aim for a balanced diversification of fuels for steam production and a mix of external procure-
ment and captive production for power generation.

ASSESSMENT OF THE OVERALL RISK SITUATION

Compared with the previous year, the overall risk situation did not change significantly in the reporting
period. The overall risk assessment is based on a consolidated view of all significant individual risks. At
present, no potential risks have been identified that either individually or in combination could endanger
the continued existence of the Bayer Group.

World +2.6% +2.5%
European Union -0.2% +0.1%
of which Germany +0.7% +0.4%

Emerging markets ** +4.9% +5.1%

* real GDP growth, source: Global Insight; source for Germany: Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology
** including about 50 countries defined by Global Insight as emerging markets in line with the World Bank

The world economy is predicted to grow at about the same pace in 2013 as in the prior year. The key fac-
tors hampering economic growth remain the economic crisis in Europe and the high level of government
debt in a number of industrialized countries, especially the United States. However, there are initial signs
that the global economic weakness may gradually be overcome during the year provided that the situation
in Europe, in particular, continues to stabilize. The monetary policy of the principal central banks will likely
remain strongly expansionary and thus help to underpin the economy.

We expect the economic situation in the European Union to slightly improve during the year, with eco-
nomic performance in the southern European countries showing a smaller decline than in 2012. We an-
ticipate slower growth in Germany in a persistently difficult environment.

In the United States, while the tense budget situation and the need for fiscal consolidation are likely to
present further obstacles to growth, the increase in employment that began in the middle of last year is
likely to spur consumer demand. There are also indications of an enduring, if slow, improvement in the
real estate market.

We continue to anticipate relatively strong growth in the emerging markets. However, economic expan-
sion in those countries as a whole will probably only slightly outpace the previous year, as many coun-
tries remain highly dependent on exports and will therefore suffer from the low demand in many of the
industrialized countries. China and Brazil especially are likely to show stronger growth again in 2013
following a relatively weak prior year.

HEALTHCARE

We expect growth in the pharmaceuticals market to continue to be driven by emerging markets such as
China, Brazil, India and Russia. The United States and a number of European countries are likely to ex-
perience declines as a result of persistently restrictive health system policies.

The consumer care market should expand at a slightly slower rate than in 2012, with higher rates of
growth in the emerging markets being offset by slower expansion in Europe and the United States. We
anticipate that the medical care market will shrink slightly in 2013 compared to 2012. Here we expect
the diabetes care market to decline, while the market for contrast agents and medical equipment is likely
to expand. We believe the animal health market as a whole will grow in 2013 at a rate comparable to
prior years despite weaker economic prospects.

CROPSCIENCE

After the global seed and crop protection market grew by more than 10% in 2012 for the second
straight year, we expect the market environment in the coming year to remain positive, though volatile.
The predicted relatively low inventories worldwide for most plant-based agricultural commodities — com-
bined with steadily rising demand for food and feed products — portend comparably high price levels at
least for the first half of 2013. Farmers’ economic prospects are therefore likely to remain positive, spur-
ring investment in high-value seed and crop protection products. The global seed and crop protection
market should benefit from this. We nevertheless anticipate a lower growth rate of at least 5% in 2013.

As last year, we expect Latin America to see the strongest market growth. With soybean cultivation
steadily increasing and now accounting for nearly 40% of the region's acreage, this is the principal crop
driving growth in the seed and crop protection market. In Asia/Pacific, too, we expect agricultural pro-
duction to go on increasing, albeit at markedly slower rates than in Latin America. The trend in this re-
gion will mainly depend on cereals and rice along with specialty crops such as fruit and vegetables. We
believe Eastern Europe and parts of Africa also have above-average growth potential, though starting
from a relatively low level. In the industrialized regions of the northern hemisphere, however, we expect
markets to expand much more slowly than in 2012.

MATERIALSCIENCE

For 2013, we predict continued stable growth in the principal global customer industries for Materi-
alScience, albeit with risks attached. The ongoing eurozone crisis, in particular, could continue to damp-
en consumer behavior. By contrast, a gradual market recovery in the United States would likely have a
positive effect. We believe the economic growth momentum will persist in Asia.

For the automotive industry, we expect significantly slower growth than in 2012. Sales in Western Europe
are currently expected to decline, with demand in nearly all countries remaining weak and automotive pro-
duction in Germany heavily dependent on export markets. On the other hand, car sales in India and China
are likely to go on increasing rapidly. Stable growth is expected in the other regions.
The global construction industry is likely to expand in 2013 at the same rate as in the previous year,
with a growing recovery in construction investment in the United States but continuing weak develop-
ment in Western Europe. The pace of growth in the most important Asian countries should remain rela-
tively constant.

Robust growth is also forecasted for the electrical/electronics sector in 2013. Demand is likely to rise
in nearly all segments of this industry, especially in the &($! countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China).
In Western Europe, however, we believe growth will be considerably weaker due to the continuing debt
crisis and consumer reticence.

We expect the trend in the global furniture industry to vary by region again in 2013. While consumer
reticence in Western Europe could affect production in Eastern Europe and Asia, we anticipate that the
gradual recovery in the North American market will continue. For Asia, we expect the region's overseas
markets to progressively recover, with domestic demand continuing to stabilize.

17.3 Sales and Earnings Forecast

The following forecasts are based on the business development described in this report, taking into
account the potential risks and opportunities.

BAYER GROUP

We expect Group sales to increase in 2013 by 4% —5% ona currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis, to
approximately €41 billion. We plan to increase )&$%*4before special items by a mid-single-digit percent-
age and core earnings per share (calculated as explained in Chapter 7.3 “Core Earnings Per Share”) by a
high-single-digit percentage.

2013 forecast

Group sales* 4% —5% increase
to approx. €41 billion

!"#$% &before special items Mid-single-digit percentage increase

Core earnings per share High-single-digit percentage increase

* currency- and portfolio-adjusted

The currency assumptions made for 2013 are approximately in line with the average exchange rates
seen in the fourth quarter of 2012, including a rate of ’# $1.29 to the euro. Compared to the currency
parities prevailing in 2012, these assumptions adversely affect the planned level of )&$%*4before
special items for 2013. A 1% appreciation (depreciation) of the euro against all other currencies would
lead to a decrease (increase) of around €270 million in sales and about €70 million in )&$%*+before
special items.
Following the successful completion of the major restructuring projects in 2012, we will continue to
execute efficiency enhancement measures, for which we expect to incur special charges of roughly
€200 million in 2013.

CropScience

We expect our research and development expenses to rise to approximately €3.2 billion. We have
planned capital expenditures of about €1.9 billion for property, plant and equipment and €0.4 billion for
intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization are estimated at about €2.6 billion, including €1.3 bil-
lion in amortization of intangible assets.

We anticipate a financial result of approximately minus €0.8 billion, taking into account the adjust-
ments resulting from $+#19 (revised). We are planning for an effective tax rate of about 26%. Regard-
ing our financial position, we expect net financial debt to be below €7.0 billion at the end of 2013.

For 2014 we plan to continue growing Bayer Group sales, )&$%*4before special items and core earnings
per share, with our new pharmaceutical products also contributing to this expansion. We plan to main-
tain about the same level of capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
as in 2013. With research and development expenses also expected to be at the 2013 level, we intend to
continue developing our projects as described in Chapter 11 “Research, Development, Innovation.” We
anticipate a further decline in net financial debt in 2014.
HEALTHCARE

HealthCare’s ongoing priority for 2013 is to successfully commercialize the new pharmaceutical prod-
ucts. We expect sales to advance by a mid-single-digit percentage on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted
basis to approximately €19 billion, with an increase in !"#$%&before special items. Earnings growth is
likely to be restrained by negative currency effects and higher marketing expenses for the launch of our
new products. We aim to slightly improve the !"#$%&margin before special items.

In the Pharmaceuticals segment we expect sales to move ahead in 2013 by a mid-single-digit percentage
ona currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis to about €11 billion. We plan to increase !"#$%&before spe-
cial items and slightly improve the !"#$%&margin before special items.

We predict that sales of the Consumer Health segment will grow by a mid-single-digit percentage ona
currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis to around €8 billion. We expect !"#$%&before special items to
increase and the !"#$%&margin before special items to be level with the prior year.

In 2014 we plan to accelerate growth momentum in both HealthCare segments, raising both sales and
!"#$% &before special items.

CROPSCIENCE
For 2013 we predict continued favorable market conditions for our CropScience business.

We expect business growth to outpace the market, with sales advancing by a high-single-digit percent-
age ona currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis toward €9 billion. We also plan to raise !"#$%&before
special items by a high-single-digit percentage.

In 2014 we plan to further increase sales and !"#$%&before special items.

MATERIALSCIENCE
For 2013 we are planning a slight increase in sales on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis to about
€12 billion. We intend to further improve !"#$%&before special items.

For the first quarter of 2013 we anticipate a currency- and portfolio-adjusted sales increase compared to
the preceding quarter. We expect !"#$%&before special items to come in at the level of the preceding
quarter.

Assuming a positive market environment, we plan to increase sales and !"#$%&before special items
again in 2014.

BAYER AG

As the holding company for the Bayer Group, Bayer AG derives most of its income from its subsidiar-
ies. The earnings of the major subsidiaries in Germany are transferred directly to Bayer AG under profit
and loss transfer agreements. The earnings of Bayer AG are therefore expected to reflect the positive
business development anticipated in the Bayer Group. A concerted dividend policy within the Group
ensures the availability of sufficient distributable income. We anticipate that the net interest position
will show a further improvement in light of the decline in financial debt and the continuing low level of
interest rates. Based on these factors, we expect Bayer AG to report a distributable profit that will again
enable our stockholders to appropriately participate in the Bayer Group’s earnings.
