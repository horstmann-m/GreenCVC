Thiess, Queensland, Australia

Thiess’ open cut mining services at Peak Downs deliver overburden
removal, and operate and maintain three ultra-class equipment
fleets.

In 2019, Thiess introduced a new state-of-the-art workshop. Similar
to a large aircraft hanger, the steel structure stands seven stories
high, has a double dome roof and allows up to four Caterpillar 797s
to be serviced simultaneously.

Designed and built in collaboration with Sedgman and CPB
Contractors, the solution integrates CIMIC Group’s civil, mechanical
and electrical engineering expertise.

Sustainable engineering ensures the structure is a moveable asset,
that can be dismantled at project completion, and reassembled at
another location or site.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION
Under section 299(1)(f) of the Corporations Act, an entity is required to provide a summary of its environmental performance in
terms of compliance with Australian environmental regulations.

Within Australia, the Company is required to report under the NGER Scheme. In addition, the Operating Companies are subject to
project specific regulations across the various jurisdictions in which they operate. Failure to comply with these corporate and
project specific requirements may result in penalties such as remediation of damage, court injunctions, and criminal and civil
penalties.

To assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities the Company has adopted a governance framework which provides for:

= the delegation of accountability for achieving compliance with regulatory requirements (and other requirements) to the most
appropriate person or group within the organisation; and

= an assurance and reporting process for the evaluation and oversight of compliance with these requirements to the Board.

In the 2019 Financial Year:

= the Company submitted its NGER Scheme report with EY, our NGER Scheme external auditor, providing limited assurance; and

= across the 147.8 million hours worked on projects there were no material breaches of legislation or conditions of approval
(ie, those resulting in prosecution, significant financial penalties or contractual action against the Company, executive officers
or individuals). However, there were 32 breaches which involved written warnings from environmental regulators and 18 fines
totalling $307,538, the detail of which is set out in the Sustainability Report.

= CPB Contractors recorded 1 Level 1 incident which related to a prosecution for the WestConnex New M5 Project. After
pleading guilty in October 2018, CPB Contractors was convicted in September 2019, in the NSW Land & Environment Court, for
causing offensive odours to be emitted at the WestConnex M5 St Peters Interchange. The offences were committed on four
occasions in April, May and June 2017 in the course of construction activities. Steps have now been taken to prevent those
incidents reoccurring.

CPB Contractors has expressed its genuine and sincere apology to the community and residents for the odour. On 25
September 2019, CPB Contractors was ordered to pay a total of $295,000 to the Environment Trust in lieu of a fine; pay the
Environmental Protection Authority's investigation and legal costs; publish a notice of apology in various media; and provide a
notice to nearby residents.

For further information regarding the Company’s environmental governance, management approach and performance (which
expands beyond compliance), please refer to the Sustainability Report within this Annual Report.

costs, charges and expenses incurred while acting in that capacity.

DIRECTORS’ DEED OF INDEMNITY

The Company has entered into deeds of indemnity, insurance and access with its current and former Directors. Under each
director’s deed, the Company indemnifies the Director to the extent permitted by law against any liability (including liability for
legal defence costs) incurred by the Director as an Officer or former Officer of the Company or any Operating Company, or while

controlled entity.

INSURANCE FOR GROUP OFFICERS
During and since the end of the 2019 Financial Year, the Company has paid or agreed to pay premiums in respect of contracts
insuring persons who are or have been an Officer against certain liabilities (including legal costs) incurred in that capacity.

Under the directors’ deeds and the deeds of indemnity described above, the Company has undertaken to the relevant Officer,

or was, held at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary.

The insurance contracts entered into by the Company prohibit disclosure of the specific nature of the liabilities covered by the
insurance contracts and the amount of the premiums.

AUDIT

The declaration by the Group’s external auditor, Deloitte, to the Directors in relation to the auditor’s compliance with the
independence requirements of the Corporations Act, and any applicable code of professional conduct for external auditors, is set
out in the section of this Directors’ Report titled ‘Lead Auditor’s independence declaration under section 307C of the Corporations
Act’.

No person who was an Officer of the Company during the 2019 Financial Year was a director or partner of the Group’s external
auditor at a time the Group’s external auditor conducted the audit.

NON-AUDIT SERVICES

Details of the amounts paid or payable to our external auditor, Deloitte, for non-audit services provided during the 2019 Financial
Year to entities within the Group are set out in the table below.

The Board has considered the position and, in accordance with the advice received from the Audit and Risk Committee, is satisfied
that the provision of non-audit services during the 2019 Financial Year is compatible with the general standard of independence for
auditors imposed by the Corporations Act.

The Board is satisfied that the provision of non-audit services by Deloitte, as set out in the following table, did not compromise the

auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act for the following reasons:

= all non-audit services were reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee and the Committee believes that they do not impact the
impartiality and objectivity of Deloitte because of the nature of the services provided during the 2019 Financial Year and the
quantum of the fees which relate to non-audit services compared with the overall fees;

= the Directors believe that none of the services undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence, including
reviewing or auditing Deloitte’s own work, acting in a management or decision-making capacity for the Group, acting as
advocate for the Group or jointly sharing economic risk and rewards; and

= these assignments were carried out in accordance with the External Auditor Independence Charter.

The non-audit services supplied to entities within the Group by Deloitte and the amount paid or payable by type of non-audit
service during the 2019 Financial Year were as follows.

Non-audit services Amount paid/payable $’000
Other assurance services 105
Taxation and other services -
Total 105

ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS

nearest hundred thousand dollars, unless otherwise indicated.

CIMIC Group Limited Annual Report 2019 | Operating and Financial Review

CONSTRUCTION REVENUE

Construction revenue was $7.5 billion for FY19, a decrease of 5.4% compared to FY18. The revenue reflects a decline in our Hong
Kong construction activities, partially offset by substantial contributions from the delivery of a number of large-scale transport
infrastructure projects in Australia.

During the period, the Group’s major construction projects included:

= rail and road developments in Australia, including Sydney Metro ‘Northwest’ and ‘City & Southwest’, WestConnex ‘M4 East’,
‘Rozelle Interchange’ and ‘New MS’ and the Woolgoolga to Ballina upgrade in New South Wales, the West Gate Tunnel project
in Victoria, and the Logan Enhancement Project in Queensland;

= social infrastructure projects including the Waikeria Corrections Facility and Christchurch Hospital in New Zealand, and the
Junee Correctional Centre in New South Wales;

= infrastructure projects in Hong Kong including the Liantang/Hueng Yuen Wai Boundary Control Point, Hong Kong International
Airport ‘Terminal 1 Annex Building and Car Park’ and ‘Terminal 2 Foundation and Substructure works’, and Black Point Power
Station; and

= several PPP projects, including Transmission Gully and New Zealand Schools in New Zealand, the Canberra Light Rail in the
Australian Capital Territory and the commencement of the Cross River Rail project in Queensland.

Construction PBT was $470.4 million for FY19 compared to $621.7 million for FY18. This reduced result is reflective of both the
trend in the revenue as well as the ongoing change in market conditions as more projects are being procured in alliance-style
contracts that have a different risk-return and also working capital profile.

MINING & MINERAL PROCESSING REVENUE

Mining & Mineral Processing revenue was $4.5 billion for FY19, an increase of 13.4%, or $530.0 million, compared to FY18. The
increase in revenue reflects a number of contract extensions, increased production levels and contributions from a diverse range of
Mining & Mineral Processing contracts, with the Group benefitting from its portfolio which is diversified across commodities and
geographic markets.

During the period, some of the Group’s most significant Mining & Mineral Processing projects included:

. Lake Vermont, Mount Owen, Curragh North, Solomon, Mount Arthur, Peak Downs and Caval Ridge mines in Australia;
= Byerwen and Mount Pleasant mineral processing projects in Australia;

. Kaltim Prima Coal, Melak and Mahakam Sumber Jaya mines in Indonesia;

= Ukhaa Khudag mine in Mongolia;

=~ Pumpkin Hollow processing plant in the United States;

. Encuentro Oxides mine in Chile; and

= Jwaneng mine in Botswana.

Mining & Mineral Processing PBT was $603.4 million for FY19. This strong result is benefitting from revenue growth combined with
further improved margins, driven by a continued focus on leveraging efficiencies and creating value for our clients.

SERVICES REVENUE
Services revenue was $2.6 billion for FY19, a steady contribution compared to FY18, as the Group sustained its competitive position
in the operations and maintenance services market.

During the period, the Group’s major services projects included:

= maintenance and supply chain services to over 1,200 passenger cars in Sydney’s metropolitan rail fleet;

. mechanical and electrical works, as well as maintenance, for the Cross River Rail project in Queensland;

= provision of rail signalling systems, tunnel systems and rolling stock, as well as franchisee operations, for a period of 15 years
as part of the Operation, Trains and System contract for the Sydney Metro ‘Northwest’ rail project;

. heavy resource maintenance works for resource companies including Chevron, BP, BHP, Rio Tinto, Woodside and Alcoa, across
Australia;

= rail rolling stock maintenance works for Pacific National and Freightliner in New South Wales;

= designing, building, testing and commissioning new waste water treatment plants, across Australia;

= delivery of operation and maintenance services in Australia’s energy sector, for companies including AGL, Stanwell and Origin;

= provision of asset management services for up to 15 years to support the Royal Australian Navy; and

= design, build and commissioning of high voltage substations and transmission lines that will connect the Prominent Hill
electricity grid to the South Australian electricity grid.

Services PBT was $154.7 million for FY19 compared to $161.0 million for FY18, with steady margins.

CORPORATE
Corporate PBT was $(128.6) million for FY19, which is stable compared to FY18. This segment includes Corporate, EIC Activities,
Pacific Partnerships and the Commercial & Residential business.

REVENUE — JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES
Revenue from joint ventures and associates was $2.5 billion for FY19, which includes revenue from investments such as Ventia.

CIMIC Group Limited Annual Report 2019 | Operating and Financial Review

EXPENSES
Expenses were $13.5 billion for FY19, consistent with FY18. The major direct expenses were materials, subcontractors, plant costs,
depreciation and personnel costs.

Depreciation and amortisation

Depreciation and amortisation was $917.6 million for FY19, an increase of 26.2%, or $190.5 million, compared to FY18. The revenue
growth in mining, as well as increases in leased mining equipment and increased tunnelling activity on a number of large
infrastructure projects, has driven the higher level of depreciation.

OPERATING PROFIT
The Group’s operating profit was $1,229.1 million for FY19, an increase of 4.7% or $55.4 million, compared to FY18. This strong
result reflects a diligent focus on project delivery and cost discipline.

NET FINANCE COSTS

Net finance costs were $129.2 million for FY19, an increase of $27.1 million compared to FY18. Higher net finance costs were
recorded due to an increase in the total level of bonding to support the growth of work in hand, mainly in Australian Construction
and PPP projects, as well as additional working capital initiatives and increases in leased asset expenses.

INCOME TAX

The income tax expense (excluding BICC) was $297.0 million for FY19, on a similar level compared to FY18. This expense equates to
an effective tax rate of 27.0%, compared with 28.0% for FY18. The reported income tax benefit of $587.5 million is a result of the
one-off item relating to the provisions and asset impairments of the Group’s financial investment in BICC and exit from the Middle
East region.

NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS
Non-controlling interests were $(2.6) million for FY19 versus $6.8 million for FY18. This relates to gains attributable to the
shareholdings of minority owners for the period.

NET PROFIT AFTER TAX

NPAT (excluding BICC) was $800.3 million for FY19, an increase of 2.8%, or $21.8 million, compared to FY18. Earnings per share
(basic) excluding BICC one-off were 246.9 cents, an increase of 2.8% on FY18. NPAT was impacted by the one-off post tax item of
$(1.8) billion relating to the provisions and asset impairments of the Group’s investment in BICC, which led to a statutory NPAT of
$(1.0) billion.

26 FY18 has been restated for the impact of AASB 16: Leases where required, effective 1 January 2019, and applied retrospectively during
2018. Refer to the Financial Report, ‘Note 1: Basis of preparation — new and amended standards adopted by the Company’ for details.

NET CASH/(DEBT)

Net cash (excluding BICC) was $1,230.2 million at 31 December 2019, compared to net cash of $1,622.4 million at 31 December
2018. Operationally, the increased number of recently awarded alliance construction projects with a different working capital
profile, the continued significant growth in Mining, as well as cash outflows from capital expenditure supporting the growth of the
business and tax payments, were the main contributing factors to this decrease.

Net cash was $831.6 million, impacted by the liquidity injections made to BICC during FY19 of $398.6 million.

Interest bearing liabilities
Current and non-current interest bearing liabilities amounted to $922.9 million at 31 December 2019.

During FY19, CIMIC successfully refinanced its core working capital cash facility, as part of its long-term financing strategy. The new
syndicated bank facility is for $1.9 billion, split equally across two tranches of four and five years. It replaced an existing tranche in
CIMIC’s current facility as well as some maturing US dollar debt.

Bonding

CIMIC has significant bonding and guarantee facilities available. These bonds and guarantees are integral to the successful
tendering and delivery of projects, and the ability to provide them is an important element of the Group’s competitive offering to
clients.

Bonds and guarantees outstanding at 31 December 2019 were $5.2 billion (31 December 2018: $4.5 billion). An additional $812.2
million (31 December 2018: $1.5 billion) was undrawn of which $753.4 million (31 December 2018: $1.1 billion) was committed and
$58.8 million (31 December 2018: $419.3 million) was uncommitted. The undrawn and uncommitted bonds and guarantees
provide significant capacity for the Group to tender for, and take on, more projects in the future.

Credit ratings

CIMIC has solid investment grade credit ratings by S&P (BBB/Stable/A-2) and Moody’s (Baa2/Stable), both with a stable outlook,
which reflect the strength of the Group’s financial position. These ratings were reaffirmed on 23 and 24'* January 2020 after
CIMIC’s announcement to exit the Middle East. In the reports, which have also been released to the ASX, S&P published a bulletin
titled “CIMIC’s exit from the Middle East consistent with Group strategy” and Moody’s published an issuer comment titled “Exit
from the Middle East is credit positive”.

32 FY18 has been restated for the impact of AASB 16: Leases where required, effective 1 January 2019, and applied retrospectively during
2018. Refer to the Financial Report, ‘Note 1: Basis of preparation — new and amended standards adopted by the Company’ for details.

CIMIC Group Limited Annual Report 2019 | Operating and Financial Review

CURRENT ASSETS

Trade and other receivables

Trade and other receivables were $3,554.4 million at 31 December 2019, an increase of 13.8%, or $432.3 million, compared to

31 December 2018. The figure includes $2,607.9 million (31 December 2018: $2,297.1 million) of total contract debtors — trade and
other receivables (refer to net contract debtors below). The remaining balance relates to sundry debtors, joint venture and other
receivables.

Net contract debtors

The Group’s net contract debtors were $1,285.7 million at 31 December 2019. The increase is partly attributable to the growth in
the Mining business where advance payments are not commonly received. CIMIC has also won a number of alliance construction
contracts in Australia over the past year with a different working capital profile compared to infrastructure projects.

The level of factoring across the Group was $1,960.3 million as at 31 December 2019, which is consistent with the 31 December
2018 position of $1,953.0 million.

The Group’s $675.0 million contract debtors portfolio provision remains unchanged as at 31 December 2019.

Inventories: consumables and development properties
Inventories: consumables and development properties were $400.1 million at 31 December 2019, an increase of $85.0 million
compared to 31 December 2018. The increase was mainly driven by job-costed inventories held for large infrastructure projects.

NON-CURRENT ASSETS

Trade and other receivables

Trade and other receivables were $130.4 million at 31 December 2019, a decrease of $647.2 million compared to 31 December
2018. Following the Group’s decision to exit the Middle East, the shareholder loans relating to BICC have been fully impaired to $nil
(31 December 2018: $640.7 million).

Investments accounted for using the equity method
Equity accounted investments include project-related associates, joint ventures and PPP projects.

Investments accounted for using the equity method were $250.5 million at 31 December 2019, an increase of $113.9 million
compared to 31 December 2018. The movement is mainly driven by new PPP investments in the year, partially offset by
successfully achieving financial close on other PPP projects. For further details refer to the Financial Report, ‘Note 13: Investments
accounted for using the equity method’.

Deferred tax asset
Deferred tax assets were $1,025.2 million at 31 December 2019, an increase of $955.6 million compared to 31 December 2018. This
variation is mainly due to the tax recognition of the one-off BICC impairment.

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment was $2,279.1 million at 31 December 2019, an increase of 10.2%, or $211.0 million, compared to

31 December 2018. At 31 December 2019, $902.1 million worth of equipment was financed by the Group through leases. Additions
to property, plant and equipment during the period included investment in job-costed tunnelling machines for major road and rail
projects and ongoing investment in mining equipment, driven by revenue growth.

Intangibles
Intangibles were $1,104.4 million at 31 December 2019, an increase of 1.0%, or $10.9 million, compared to 31 December 2018. The
balance mainly consists of goodwill in relation to the Construction and Services businesses.

CIMIC Group Limited Annual Report 2019 | Operating and Financial Review

CURRENT LIABILITIES

Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables were $6,024.6 million at 31 December 2019, an increase of 6.3%, or $354.9 million, compared to

31 December 2018. This figure includes $1,322.2 million (31 December 2018: $1,198.2 million) of total contract liabilities — trade
and other payables. The remaining balance includes trade creditors and accruals, joint venture payables and other creditors.

Current tax liabilities

Current tax liabilities were $60.3 million at 31 December 2019, a decrease of $8.1 million compared to 31 December 2018. Changes
in tax liabilities are driven by the timing of the various income tax payments as required to be made across the numerous
jurisdictions in which the Group operates.

Provisions

Provisions were $327.2 million at 31 December 2019, an increase of $1.2 million compared to 31 December 2018. The provisions
are for employee benefits and relates to wages and salaries, annual leave, long service leave, retirement benefits and deferred
bonuses.

Financial liability

A financial liability of $1,483.4 million has been recognised as at 31 December 2019. This represents the amounts expected to be
paid in relation to BICC facilities where CIMIC provides a guarantee. Refer to the Financial Report, ‘Note 4: Significant item;
Provisions and Asset Impairment in relation to Middle East exit’ for further details.

NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables were $200.8 million at 31 December 2019, an increase of $118.8 million compared to 31 December 2018.

Provisions
Provisions were $60.5 million at 31 December 2019, a decrease of 3.0%, or $1.9 million, compared to 31 December 2018. This
figure includes employee benefits relating to long service leave, retirement benefits and deferred bonuses.

EQUITY

Equity (excluding BICC) was $2,563.2 million as at 31 December 2019, an increase of $277.0 million, or 12.1%, compared to 31
December 2018. This was driven by the Group’s operational performance resulting in net profit (excluding BICC) of $800.3 million,
offset by dividend payments of $509.1 million for the year.

Equity was $723.0 million as at 31 December 2019, a decrease of $1,563.2 million compared to 31 December 2018. The decrease is
due to the one-off item in relation to the provisions and asset impairments of the Group’s financial investment in BICC and exit
from the Middle East region.

CIMIC Group Limited Annual Report 2019 | Operating and Financial Review

OPERATING CASH FLOWS
Operating cash flows pre-factoring have improved substantially, increasing by $1,048.6 million to $1,707.0 million in FY19. This is
attributable to a strict focus on managing working capital and generating sustainable cash-backed profits.

Operating cash flows were $1,714.3 million for FY19, with the change to the previous year being attributable to 2019’s stable
factoring balance.

The Group has maintained a solid EBITDA cash conversion rate of 80% (excluding BICC) during FY19.

Net cash from operating activities decreased by $652.5 million to $1,250.5 million in FY19. This is attributable to additional income
tax payments of $292.3 million. Changes in taxes paid are impacted by the timing of payments and receipt of refunds outside of the
financial year to which they relate.

CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES
Net cash outflows from investing activities were $1,191.0 million for FY19 compared to an outflow of $545.2 million in FY18.

The outflow of cash was mainly due to gross capital expenditure of $774.4 million for FY19, an increase of $227.0 million compared
to FY18. This increase reflects a sustained level of investment in tunnelling equipment to support the delivery of large transport
related infrastructure projects with ongoing investment in mining equipment driven by revenue growth in that market.

During the period the Mining & Mineral Processing business acquired a controlling interest in Majwe Mining in Botswana, and the
Services business purchased an engineering company from RCR Tomlinson that operates in the infrastructure, energy and resource
sectors.

Additionally, liquidity injections of $398.6 million were made to BICC in the FY19.
CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

Net cash outflows from financing activities were $460.0 million for FY19 compared to $1,089.9 million in FY18. This outflow mainly
represents proceeds from borrowings, largely offset by repayment of leases, borrowings and dividends paid.

ions and the breadth of its geographies and markets, a wide range of risk factors have the
siness objectives. Key risks, including those arising due to externalities such as the

economic, natural and social operating environments, are set out in the following table, together with the Group’s approach to

managing those risks.

Risk description

Risk management approach

The Group’s operations require planning, training and supervision to manage workplace health and safety hazards.

A workplace health and safety
incident or event may put our people
and the community at risk.

The Group is committed to the health, safety and security of our people and the
communities in which we work. Safety policies and standards apply across the Group.
Compliance is regularly reviewed. The Group seeks continual improvement in safety
performance. Governance of safety is overseen by the Board and the Ethics,
Compliance and Sustainability Committee.

The Group often works within, or adjace!

nt to, sensitive environments.

An environmental incident or
unplanned event may occur that
adversely impacts the environment or
the communities in which we work.

The Group is committed to the highest standard of environmental performance.
Operating Companies’ environmental policies and procedures are aligned with the
Group Policy and Standards. Should an incident occur, emergency response plans will
be enacted. Governance of environmental performance is over seen by the Ethics,
Compliance and Sustainability Committee.

External factors may affect the Group’s m

arkets and growth plans.

Changes in economic, political or
societal trends, or unforeseen
external events and actions, may
affect business development and
project delivery.

The Group maintains a diverse portfolio of projects and investments across a range of
markets and geographies. Regular and rigorous reviews of the Group’s current and
potential geographies, industries, activities and competitors are undertaken. Oversight
of key risks is maintained by the Audit and Risk Committee, supported by a quarterly
Risk Report that aggregates and highlights risks to the Group achieving its objectives.

Reduction in demand for global
commodities and/or price may cause
resource clients to curtail or cease
capital investment programmes, or
adjust operations, thereby impacting
existing and future contracts.

The Group maintains a project, contract and investment portfolio that is diversified by
geography, market, activity and client to mitigate the impact of emerging trends and
market volatility.

The Group continually seeks opportunities to improve its operations and thereby the

CIMIC Group Limited Annual Report 2019 | Operating and Financial Review

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES DURING FY19

= On 23 January 2020 the Group announced to the ASX that it had completed an extensive strategic review of its financial
investment in BICC, a company operating in the Middle East. After thorough evaluation of all available options, CIMIC has
decided to exit the region and to focus its resources and capital allocation on growth opportunities in its main core markets
and geographies. This has resulted in a one-off post tax impact of $(1.8) billion relating to the financial investment of BICC as a
result of the decision to exit the Middle East region.

= On 13 December 2019, CIMIC announced a further on-market share buyback of up to 10% of CIMIC’s fully paid ordinary shares
for a period of 12 months commencing 29 December 2019; no shares have been bought back under this scheme. During the
previous share buyback which ended on 28 December 2019, 527,341 shares were bought back for $16.7 million and the shares
were subsequently been cancelled.

= On 4 February 2020 the Group has appointed a new Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Juan Santamaria.
The appointment is effective from 5 February 2020.

SHAREHOLDERS

The largest shareholder in CIMIC is HOCHTIEF Australia Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of HOCHTIEF AG, which owns
72.8% of CIMIC as at 31 December 2019. HOCHTIEF AG is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The largest shareholder in
HOCHTIEF AG is Spanish based company Actividades de Construccion y Servicios, SA (ACS), which held 50.41% of the shares in

STRATEGY AND OPERATING ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

CIMIC is an engineering-led construction, mining, services and PPP leader with a history dating back to 1899 and around 40,000
people delivering services in 20 countries. Our mission is to generate sustainable shareholder returns by delivering innovative and
competitive solutions for clients, and safe, fulfilling careers for our people. We strive to be known for our principles of Integrity,
Accountability, Innovation and Delivery, underpinned by Safety.

CIMIC is well placed in geographies and markets that are expected to continue to grow and provide a broad range of opportunities
for the foreseeable future.

OPERATING MODEL AND STRATEGY

CIMIC operates through activity-based businesses in construction, mining & mineral processing, operation and maintenance
services, PPPs and engineering. These businesses deliver services in Australia and select markets in Asia, the near Pacific, Southern
Africa, and the Americas.

CIMIC’s strategy has the following key elements:

= to be an engineering-led, industry-leading group with a balanced portfolio diversified by market sector, activity, geography,
type of client, contract type, volume and duration. This diversification and our scale reduce earnings volatility, facilitates the
management of risk and helps to create sustainable returns;

= to offer integrated solutions through a complementary suite of capabilities for the entire life-cycle of assets — from
development and financing to engineering, construction, mining, and operations and maintenance;

= to selectively export the Group’s capabilities and expand into other markets which meet our governance, risk, and return
requirements, either organically or through acquisition; and

= to utilise common systems and processes to facilitate the sharing of innovation and knowledge.

Underpinning the strategy is the pursuit of operational excellence in terms of:
= identifying value-adding engineering solutions;

= applying a disciplined approach to risk management;

= rigorously managing cash;

= maintaining a tight control on costs; and

= ensuring an uncompromising focus on safety.

Fundamental to the delivery of the strategy is a strong balance sheet, which supports organic growth and provides flexibility in
capital expenditure and investments into PPPs, as well as strategic capital allocation opportunities including acquisitions.

Our financial policy is to manage net debt to a level that supports a strong investment grade rating.

CONSTRUCTION MARKET

Across the Group’s core construction markets of Australia, New Zealand and selected countries in the Asia-Pacific region,
governments and the private sector are continuing to invest significantly to meet sustained demand for economic and social
infrastructure. This investment is necessary to address historic underinvestment, support population growth and ageing
populations, meet market and technological changes - such as the transition to renewables and the digital transformation - tackle
climate change and to facilitate economic growth and productivity. This infrastructure investment should continue to deliver a
broad and growing suite of project opportunites that underpins the Group’s positive outlook for the construction market.

42


--- Page 29 ---

CIMIC Group Limited Annual Report 2019 | Operating and Financial Review

Australia’s construction market is expected to remain strong, with transport infrastructure remaining a key contributor of
opportunities. Underpinning the transport sector are a number of very substantial road and rail projects in the major capital cities,
supplemented by the continued upgrading of interstate transport routes and investment to facilitate rail freight.

Federal, State and Territory Governments have all put forward substantial infrastructure programs in their most recent budgets. In
the 2019-20 Budget, the Australian Federal Government outlined a $100 billion commitment to fund national building
infrastructure over the next decade, with major investments in every state and territory’. In November 2019, the Federal
Government announced that it was bringing forward $3.8 billion of infrastructure spending to provide more economic stimulus*°.

In New South Wales, the 2019-20 State Government Budget outlines a record $93 billion capital works program over the next four
years, of which $55.6 billion is to be spent on transport infrastructure - including funding commitments for the delivery of Sydney
Metro West, WestConnex and the Sydney Gateway project“. The Victorian Government's infrastructure investment is projected to
be $53.7 billion from 2019-20 to 2022-23 — including funding commitments for the North East Link, Suburban Roads Upgrade,
Melbourne Airport Rail and the removal of additional level crossings’. In the most recent Queensland State Budget, the
government outlined a $49.5 billion infrastructure investment program over the next four years, which includes funding
commitments for the Cross River Rail project, Bruce Highway upgrades and the M11 Pacific Motorway upgrades*?. The other
Australian State and Territory Governments are also expected to invest in transport projects, providing a broad range of
construction opportunities for the Group.

Within these State Government Budgets are substantial investments on hospitals and health care, reflecting the country’s ageing
and growing population. This investment should sustain a range of opportunities in the capital cities and in major regional centres.
The Budgets also earmark considerable funding for water and energy projects, many of which are expected to suit the Group’s
capabilities and offer construction opportunities.

In New Zealand, the Government remains committed to improving the nation’s infrastructure, removing bottlenecks and improving
productivity. As part of this commitment, New Zealand’s newly established independent Infrastructure Commission, Te Waihanga,
released a planned infrastructure projects pipeline of NZ$21.1 billion. The pipeline identifies over 500 credibly proposed and
committed infrastructure projects from 15 government agencies and local councils that are planned for delivery over the next
decade**.

The Group’s other international construction markets are expected to sustain high levels of investment in economic and social
infrastructure projects which should continue to deliver a broad range of opportunities.

PPP MARKET

Governments across Australia, New Zealand and the Asia-Pacific are increasingly embracing PPPs as a model for the financing and

delivery of infrastructure projects, notably in the sectors of transport and social infrastructure. PPPs are often cited as potentially

providing a range of benefits that include:

= allowing governments to free up their budgets by leveraging access to private capital;

= incentivising the private sector to deliver projects on time and within budget;

= using private sector technology and innovation to provide better public services through improved operational efficiency;

= imposing budgetary certainty by setting the present and future costs of infrastructure projects over time; and

= extracting long-term value-for-money through appropriate risk transfer to the private sector over the life of a project — from
design and construction to operations and maintenance*>.

In Australia, the Coalition of Governments continues to support the National PPP Policy Framework which established that projects
valued over $50 million should be considered for PPP procurement’. In New Zealand, the Government is actively pursuing non-
traditional procurement options, involving greater private sector involvement in the provision of both infrastructure and services,
where these can demonstrate greater value for money to the public sector.

Growth in the PPP market - in part driven by an increasing acceptance by the public of a user-pays model - is creating a range of
opportunities. CIMIC’s PPP pipeline is currently estimated to be $130 billion. This pipeline includes some large heavy rail and light
rail projects, numerous road projects, and a range of social infrastructure projects, including schools, prisons - with scope to
provide non-custodial services, hospitals and utilities.

Our ability to provide an end-to-end service offering and strong competitive position, positions the Group to pursue the emerging
prospects in this market. Opportunities in the PPP market are likely to continue to include varying combinations of design,
construction, finance and operation and maintenance of infrastructure.

MINING & MINERAL PROCESSING MARKET

Population growth, increasing urbanisation, rising living standards and sustained economic growth are expected to continue across
much of Asia for the foreseeable future and to sustain demand for energy and minerals. Additionally, limited substitutes for the
major commodities mined or processed by the Group supports a positive outlook for this market.

Australia’s resource and energy exports are forecast to increase to a record $281 billion in 2019-20, helped by a 5.9% rise in export
volumes this year. On current forecasts, Australian exports by volume are expected to grow by 3.5% per annum for metallurgical
coal, 0.9% for thermal coal, 3.0% for iron ore and 9.5% for nickel until 2020-214”. As leaders in the mining services and mineral
processing sectors, Thiess and Sedgman will continue to benefit from this robust demand.

Outside of Australia, CIMIC will continue to selectively export the Group’s mining and mineral processing capabilities and seek
opportunities to expand into markets which meet our governance, risk, and return requirements.

We are seeing increased opportunities to provide value-adding services to new and existing clients domestically and abroad,
particularly in coal and iron ore. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to cleaner energy sources and solutions will gradually create
opportunities for the extraction and processing of minerals used in alternative technologies, such as solar and batteries.

SERVICES MARKET

Sustained investment in infrastructure - creating a larger capital stock — and a degree of underinvestment in the past on
maintenance services should continue to support a growing market for the provision of operations and maintenance services. In
addition, asset owners are increasingly seeing the benefit of outsourcing their maintenance services to drive productivity
improvements and to pursue operational efficiencies.

The Australian maintenance services market is expected to be worth approximately $42.4 billion in 2018-19, of which 56.4% is
outsourced to the private sector. The outsourced maintenance market is forecast to increase by 33% over the next decade with
growth expected in the engineering, construction, maintenance, and operation services in the rail, transportation, technology,
energy, resources, water, renewable energy, and defence sectors*8.

CIMIC is well positioned to benefit from this growing market, leveraging the Group’s complementary suite of activities, and will
continue to seek opportunities to grow its capabilities in existing and new markets.

Around $380 billion of projects are coming to the market in 2021 and beyond, including about $130 billion worth of PPP projects.

CIMIC continues to consider opportunities to diversify and expand into new regions and markets by leveraging its existing
capabilities. The Group is also continuing to analyse opportunities to make acquisitions which broaden the service offering.

The Group’s positive outlook is founded on a disciplined focus of sustaining a strong balance sheet, generating cash, and rigorous
approach to tendering and project delivery. This focus, combined with the Group’s strong competitive position and the range of
opportunities across the core markets, provides a solid base for the generation of sustainable returns.

GUIDANCE
CIMIC expects 2020 NPAT to be in the range of $810 million to $850 million, subject to market conditions.

LT

There was no LTI grant in the 2019 Financial Year. The table below provides a summary of the 2015 LTI currently on foot.

Summary of 2015 LT! grants

Senior Executive
participation

Mr Wright and Mr Camphausen participated in the 2015 LTI. Mr Fernandez Verdes and Mr Segura
Surifiach did not participate in the LTI.

What are the
vesting conditions
and why were they
chosen?

Options vest over a 2 year performance period, subject to the Senior Executive’s continued employment
with the CIMIC Group. The options have an in-built performance hurdle, being the exercise price of the
options, meaning that at the time of exercise, the market price of CIMIC shares must be above the
exercise price of the options before the Senior Executive can derive any benefit from the award. Details
of the exercise price calculation are set out in ‘Note 38: Employee benefits’ to the Financial Report within
this Annual Report. This structure was selected to provide participants with a clear line of sight as to the
targets that must be satisfied, and a stronger alignment between individual performance and vesting
outcomes, ensuring a Group-wide focus on sustained growth and Group prosperity.

When are the
options available to
exercise?

The options vest 2 years after the grant date and are available to be exercised for a period of 3 years
subject to the discretion of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. The Senior Executive is
permitted to exercise up to 40% of their vested options in each of the first 2 years after vesting and the
remaining unexercised portion in year 3 of the exercise window. Any options that remain unexercised at
the end of the exercise window (ie, 5 years after the grant date) will expire. The most recent options
awarded, being the 2015 awards, vested in full in November 2017, with any vested options that remain
unexercised expiring on 29 October 2020.

What are the
methods of
exercise?

In accordance with the terms of the award, the Company determined at vesting that all options available
to be exercised in the first year after vesting (ie, up to 28 October 2018) will be paid in cash in lieu of an
allocation of shares based on the current market price of shares at the date of exercise, less the exercise
price and all applicable taxes and levies. In October 2018, the Company determined that the vested
options available to be exercised in years 2 and 3 of the exercise window will also be settled in cash in
lieu of an allocation of shares as described above.

Do the options
attract dividends
and voting rights?

The options do not carry any rights to dividends or voting. If the Company determines that shares are to
be allocated upon the exercise of options, these will rank equally with other ordinary shares on issue.

What happens if
there is a change of
control?

If a change of control occurs, the Company in its discretion may determine whether, and the extent to
which, any unvested options will vest or cease to be subject to restrictions (as applicable), having regard
to all relevant circumstances including performance to-date and the nature of the change of control.

What if a Senior
Executive ceases
employment?

If a Senior Executive resigns or is summarily terminated, any vested but unexercised and any unvested
option grants will lapse. Generally, if a Senior Executive leaves due to any other circumstances (eg,
retrenchment, genuine redundancy or other special circumstances):

-  apro rata portion of the Senior Executive’s unvested options will remain on foot following his
or her termination and vest subject to the original conditions of the award (with the balance
lapsing); and

- any vested but unexercised options held at the date of cessation of employment will remain on
foot until the expiry date, subject to the same restrictions on exercise as if the Senior Executive
had remained with the Group.

In these circumstances, any entitlement on exercise will be paid in cash based on the current market
price of shares at the date of exercise, less the exercise price and all applicable taxes and levies. The
Remuneration and Nomination Committee retains authority to exercise discretion on leaver treatment
for Senior Executives.

CIMIC Group Limited Annual Report 2019 | Remuneration Report

REMUNERATION — EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN

POLICY AND APPROACH
The Board approves the Executive Chairman’s remuneration arrangements following consideration by the Remuneration and
Nomination Committee.

The Board considered Mr Fernandez Verdes’ roles as Executive Chairman of CIMIC, Chairman of the Executive Board of HOCHTIEF
AG and CEO of ACS Group and structured his remuneration arrangements differently from other Senior Executives, but consistent
with the Group’s remuneration framework and focused on achieving long-term financial returns.

COMPONENTS

In accordance with the terms of Mr Fernandez Verdes’ Executive Service Agreement (ESA), the key components of his

remuneration are:

= an annual allowance as a contribution to his living expenses. Mr Fernandez Verdes’ ESA provides for the allowance amount to
be indexed in line with CPI changes, however this will not be applied for 2020 and so there will be no change for the year. Prior
to 2019, Mr Fernandez Verdes was paid an allowance on which Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) was payable due to his travel
patterns and living away from home arrangements while in Australia. From January 2019, Pay As You Go (PAYG) withholding
tax is payable rather than FBT to reflect a change in his travel patterns. This change in tax treatment results in a decrease in
the gross amount payable in order to maintain the net allowance (subject to CPI changes noted above):

Year | Gross allowance amount (AS) Reason

2018 518,124 | Effective 1 January 2018 to accommodate 1.8% CPI increase

2019 475,243 | Effective 1 January 2019 to accommodate 1.9% CPI increase to the net
allowance amount and change to PAYG withholding tax payable. The change in
tax treatment results in a lower gross allowance amount.

2020 475,243 | No change.

= a one-off award of Share Appreciation Rights (SARs) in 2014; and
= the payment of a discretionary bonus at any time during the course of employment.

Mr Fernandez Verdes receives remuneration from HOCHTIEF AG in consideration for his employment as Chairman of the Executive
Board of HOCHTIEF AG, and from ACS Group in consideration for his employment as ACS Group CEO. Details of this remuneration
are available in the HOCHTIEF AG Annual Report at http://www.reports.hochtief.com and the ACS Group Annual Report at
http://www.grupoacs.com/shareholders-investors/annual-report/.

Summary of one-off award to Mr Fernandez Verdes
Mr Fernandez Verdes was granted a one-off award of 1,200,000 SARs in 2014 in accordance with the terms of his ESA. As the SARs
form part of his remuneration, they are granted at no cost to him. The SARs do not carry any rights to dividends or voting.

The SARs entitle Mr Fernandez Verdes to receive a cash payment reflecting the increase in value of the share price of CIMIC from a
base price of $17.71 (being the VWAP of fully paid ordinary shares in CIMIC traded on the ASX over the 30-day period before Mr
Fernandez Verdes’ appointment as CEO on 13 March 2014) to the price at close of trading on the last trading day before the SAR is
exercised, with a maximum payment per SAR of $32.29.

The SARs vested in full on 13 March 2016 and were exercisable for 3 years from the date of vesting. No more than 40% of the SARs
could be exercised each year for the first 2 years after vesting, and any remaining SARs could be exercised in the final year of the
exercise period.

The SARs would have lapsed on 13 March 2019 unless they had been exercised or forfeited before that date.

Mr Fernandez Verdes would have forfeited any unvested or vested but unexercised SARs if he had ceased to be the CEO of CIMIC
before 31 December 2014. Further, Mr Fernandez Verdes would have forfeited any unvested or vested but unexercised SARs if he
did not remain a member of either the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board of HOCHTIEF AG for the period from appointment
to 13 March 2017. Mr Fernandez Verdes would have forfeited any unvested or vested but unexercised SARs if his employment was
summarily terminated. If Mr Fernandez Verdes had ceased employment with CIMIC prior to vesting but after 31 December 2014 in
any other circumstance (ie, he was not summarily terminated) but remained a member of either the Executive Board or the
Supervisory Board of HOCHTIEF AG, any unvested SARs would have remained on foot and vested and become exercisable in the
ordinary course.

On 18 February 2019, Mr Fernandez Verdes exercised 240,000 SARs (20% of the total number of SARs available to exercise in the
third year after vesting, prior to the final exercise date) resulting in a gross cash payment of $7,704,000. The payment was

calculated by reference to the CIMIC closing share price on 15 February 2019 of $49.81.

There are no outstanding SARs at the end of the 2019 Financial Year.

experienced Directors. Fees are based on a comparison to the market for director fees in companies of a similar size and
complexity.

to Directors for Committee membership.

With the exception of Mr Valderas and Mr Muriel, who continue to hold 2015 LTI options from their previous roles as Senior
Executives, Non-executive Directors do not receive shares, options or any performance-related incentives.

Superannuation is payable to Australian-based Directors in addition to Board and Committee fees in accordance with compulsory
Superannuation Guarantee requirements under Australian legislation.
