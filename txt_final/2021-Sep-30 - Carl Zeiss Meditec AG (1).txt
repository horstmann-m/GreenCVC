CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

There were no significant changes to the Group's reporting entity or the structure of its consolidated financial
statements in fiscal year 2020/21.

Markets

With its headquarters in Jena (Germany) and additional plants and subsidiaries in Germany, France, Spain,
the USA, Japan and China, among others, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has a direct presence in key medical
technology markets. The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group also utilizes the distribution network of the ZEISS Group,
with around 60 sales and service locations and more than 30 production sites, thus ensuring itself customer
proximity in international competition. Aside from its own research and development (R&D) locations, the
Carl Zeiss Meditec Group also has access to the expertise of the ZEISS Group. Of the around 27 research and
development locations of the ZEISS Group worldwide, China and India, in particular, are important research
centers. They offer the possibility of working with the customers on site, in order to gain a better regional
understanding of the market and develop specific products that are tailored to market requirements.

Organization and business activity

The field of activity of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is essentially divided into two main areas in which the
Company operates: Ophthalmology and Microsurgery. In order to ensure a strong customer focus, as well as
one-stop, end-to-end solutions, this distinction is also reflected in the strategic business units (SBUs). Business
operations are grouped according to areas of application and customer groups in both the Ophthalmic
Devices (OPT) SBU and the Microsurgery (MCS) SBU

Ophthalmic Devices
Conditions such as ametropia (refraction), cataracts, glaucoma and retinal disorders, the incidence of which
particularly increases with age and can become chronic in many cases, are treated in ophthalmology.

In the Ophthalmic Devices strategic business unit the Company offers a wide range of products and solutions
for the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases, as well as systems and consumables particularly for cataract,
retinal and refractive surgery. Customers here are both practicing ophthalmologists and optometrists, as well
as physicians and surgeons in hospitals and outpatient surgery centers.

In the field of diagnostics products include devices for general ophthalmological examinations (slit lamps,
refractometers, tonometers), devices for examining the retina (optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus
cameras), as well as functional diagnostics equipment (perimeters). Digital products for the efficient organization
of clinical workflows and for the storage and evaluation of clinical data complement the product range. The
offering for surgical therapy (particularly for cataracts) includes, among other things, ophthalmic surgery
microscopes, biometers and phacoemulsification/vitrectomy devices. The portfolio of microincision-capable
intraocular lenses (IOL) ranges from the standard (monofocal lenses) to the premium segment (e.g. toric multi-
focal lenses). The OR workstation is completed by software-based assistance systems such as CALLISTO eye®, to
assist with the implantation of toric intraocular lenses. Surgeons are given the opportunity to further increase
their efficiency with systems that are precisely tailored to the surgeon's workflow and integrated with each
other. One example of this is the market launch of the new QUATERA® 700, an integrated workflow solution
in the field of cataract surgery. The QUATERA® 700 merges all elements of the ZEISS Cataract Workflow by
combining workflow steps and phaco steps from CALLISTO eye® into a single workflow.

The product portfolio in the area of refractive surgery primarily includes systems and consumables for refractive
surgery. This includes the SMILE® lenticule extraction procedure for the correction of vision defects using a

minimally invasive procedure.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Microsurgery

In the Microsurgery strategic business unit ZEISS provides visualization solutions for minimally invasive surgical
treatments. The state-of-the-art surgical microscopes for neurosurgery are essential tools that are used, for
example, in the surgical treatment of tumors or vascular conditions, such as aneurysms. KINEVO® 900, a robotic
visualization system for neurosurgeons, is one good example of how ZEISS supports physicians in streamlining
their workflows. Other key areas include ear, nose and throat (ENT), plastic and reconstructive (P&R) and dental
and spinal surgery. Innovative add-on functions, such as cutting-edge video technologies, 3D imaging or
intraoperative fluorescence options, offer the physician support for complex treatments. During the procedure,
diagnostic data and information can be provided to the physician in the eyepiece or on monitors.

Group strategy

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's strategy is to achieve sustainable and profitable growth as market and
technology leader in the field of ophthalmology and microsurgery. The product range aims to improve the
treatment outcome and reduce treatment costs through efficient and effective approaches, and thus contribute
to medical progress. From the Company's perspective, the key success factors are as follows: customer focus,
innovation and integrated solutions for diagnosis and treatment.

Customer focus

Customers of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group are facing major challenges in managing rising patient numbers,
limited public funding and more demanding expectations of the treatment outcome. Integrated products
and solutions can help customers to streamline workflows and cut costs. One example of this is the provision
of clinical decision-making aids to the physician and possibilities to easily outsource routine tasks to medical
support staff. Digitalization provides major opportunities in this respect, including in the area of data
management solutions. A key prerequisite for the long-term success of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is a
deep understanding of the challenges that the doctors are facing and a solution offering that is tailored to
overcome these challenges.

Innovation

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group strives to make cutting-edge technology in medical application accessible for
practitioners and patients and to establish new benchmarks (gold standards) in diagnostics and therapy. Close
collaboration with customers and continuous investment in research and development secure the Company's
technological leadership.

Integrated solutions

The logical networking of devices and systems in the practice or clinic into integrated solutions plays an
important role, giving customers the opportunity to make their workflows efficient, and to improve clinical
outcomes through integrated availability and evaluation of the data. Comprehensive system integration,
including IT-assisted analysis functions, is a key prerequisite for this. In the fiscal year under review the Company
launched the ZEISS Medical Ecosystem. This is a concept that networks devices, data and applications to
enable improved clinical efficiency and performance

Corporate governance

The central governing bodies within the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group are the Management Board and the
Executive Committee. The Executive Committee is formed from the members of the Management Board of
Carl Zeiss Meditec AG the heads of the two strategic business units Ophthalmic Devices and Microsurgery.
The management levels below the Executive Committee perform their management responsibilities in

accordance with the organizational structure across regions and company locations. Cross-organizational
functions, such as Finance, Communications or Human Resources, for example, are managed centrally. The
strategies and projects are implemented locally at the country organizations in accordance with the respective
prevailing laws, rules of procedure and bylaws, and the applicable corporate values and principles.

As a company of the ZEISS Group, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is also subject to the global Code of Conduct
of the ZEISS Group (“Code of Conduct of the ZEISS Group”). This stipulates the general rules of good and fair
conduct in competition and when dealing with our employees and customers. The Code of Conduct sets out
the fundamental ethical principles of good conduct and values which govern the actions of both management
and employees in their day-to-day work at the Company.

Corporate management

The consistent implementation of the Group strategy aims to ensure a long-term increase in value. A
comprehensive system of key performance indicators serves as a tool for the financial management of the
Carl Zeiss Meditec Group. The greatest importance is attached to Economic Value Added® (EVA®)', Free Cash
Flow (FCF), the EBIT margin and revenue growth. These control ratios define the balance between growth,
profitability and financial power, upon which sustainable growth of the Company is built. These key performance
indicators are therefore defined as control variables. These are supplemented by strategic measures and projects
in the areas of customer excellence, people/performance culture and operational excellence.

BUSINESS REPORT?

Underlying conditions for business development

Macroeconomic conditions*

Fiscal year 2020/21 was still considerably impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. After the abrupt decline in
demand and production, followed by a gradual recovery in 2020, economic growth picked up strongly again,
especially in 2021. The affected countries and industries are recovered to varying degrees, however, and at
varying speeds. Capacity and supply bottlenecks led to price increases. In particular, this meant that the high
demand from customers could not be fully met in the manufacture of semiconductor chips.

Situation in the medical technology industry

The Company sees medical technology as a steadily growing industry in the medium and long term. Growth
drivers are medical progress, the aging population due to demographic development and global population
growth. A distinction should be made here between western industrialized nations and growing markets. In
the Management Board's view, rising per capita income creates a favorable condition for increasing the
demand for basic medical care in rapidly growing economies, as well as the growing willingness of people in

the western regions to take advantage of better-quality services. Furthermore, the Company expects the number
of patients suffering from age-related illnesses to rise continuously. At the same time, it is anticipated that the
need for comprehensive, high-quality health care will also increase. An increased demand from patients and a
strong willingness of self-payers to make use of premium services play a major role from the Company's
perspective. At the same time, the cost pressure in the health care systems is leading to price-driven competition.
In terms of product development and licensing, increasing regulation and varying regional regulatory requirements
are posing growing challenges. Equally high are the requirements for manufacturers and for products and
solutions that both increase workflow efficiency for customers and offer more effective treatment methods for
patients.

The management anticipates further growth in the long term, in both microsurgery and ophthalmology, as the
demand for diagnostic and therapeutic devices and systems and for implants and consumables will increase
further due to rising numbers of cases.

a) Market for ophthalmic products

The market for ophthalmic products in the broader sense includes devices and systems for the diagnosis,
treatment and post-treatment of eye diseases, implants for ophthalmic surgery and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals,
contact lenses, contact lens care products, consumables — with the exception of glasses and glasses frames.
According to the Company's estimates, the market had a global volume of around US$41.2b (about €36.8b)

in 2020.* The Company's product range includes devices and systems, implants, consumables and instruments
for ophthalmology and ophthalmic surgery. According to the Company's estimates, these sub-markets had a
volume of around US$10.4b (around €9.3b*) in 2020. On this basis, the Company estimates its market share by
revenue in 2020 at around 11% and now considers itself the second-largest supplier worldwide in this market
behind the ophthalmic surgery business of Alcon.

Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the market for equipment and systems, implants, consumables and

instruments for ophthalmology also recorded a significant decline of approximately -12% in 2020 compared
with the prior year. The Company expects to see a recovery to around the level of 2019 in 2021. In the long
term, and aside from annual fluctuations, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group still expects the market for products
for ophthalmology to continue growing, due to the unchanged demographic and other growth drivers.

Overall, based on the information at hand, the Company expects to have increased its market share in the
product segments it addresses, compared with the prior year.

b) Market for microsurgery products

Aside from ophthalmology the Company also operates in the microsurgery market. Surgical microscopes are
a subsection of this market. Applications are particularly in neuro/ENT surgery, as well as other areas, such as
spinal, OMF, plastic and reconstructive and dental surgery.

According to the Company's estimates, this product segment had a total volume of around US$0.6b
(around €0.5b)°.

With an estimated market share of over 50%, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is the largest supplier in this field
and the clear market leader.

Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the market experienced a significant decline in 2020, which is assumed

to be a temporary effect. The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group expects the market for microsurgical products to
continue to grow in the medium term, irrespective of year-to-year fluctuations.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Overall assertion on the financial position of Carl Zeiss Meditec Group
at the end of the fiscal year

In an ad hoc disclosure on 19 April 2021 the Company's management firmed up its forecast for fiscal year 2020/21
due to the further normalization of demand from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to further
increases in growth and revenue in the months that followed the Company raised its targets for fiscal year
2020/21 by way of an ad hoc disclosure on 16 July 2021, according to which revenue was expected to exceed
the target set in April of around €1.6b. The EBIT margin was expected to significantly exceed the target set in
April of around 20%, bolstered to a great extent by the currently low selling and marketing expenses.

With revenue of €1,646.8m (prior year: €1,335.5m) and growth of 23.3% (adjusted for currency effects:
26.5%), the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group fulfilled the most recent forecast of revenue exceeding around €1.6b
for fiscal year 2020/21.

The SBU Ophthalmic Devices generated revenue of €1,255.7m (prior year: €990.6m), which equated to
growth of 26.8% (adjusted for currency effects: 29.8%), thus significantly exceeding market growth, which
was estimated in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range. This increase is in particular attributable to
strong business in the areas of refractive lasers and surgical ophthalmology. The Ophthalmic Diagnostics
segment also grew.

The Microsurgery SBU generated revenue of €391.1m (prior year: €344.8m), thus recording an increase of
13.4% (adjusted for currency effects: 17.1%) compared with the prior year. The SBU therefore surpassed
market growth significantly, which was estimated to be in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range.

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) more than doubled to €373.6m (prior year: €177.6m). Relative to
revenue, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group achieved an EBIT margin of 22.7% (prior year: 13.3%), thus achieving
the target of significantly exceeding around 20%, as stated in the ad hoc disclosure published on 16 July 2021.
The positive development of the EBIT margin was due, among other things, to a more favorable product mix
with a high proportion of recurring revenue, accompanied at the same time by continued low selling and
marketing expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic

The EBIT margin in the strategic business unit Ophthalmic Devices increased significantly as a result of a
favorable development of the product mix due to an increased proportion of consumables compared with the
prior year, ultimately increasing to slightly above the Group average. The EBIT margin of the Microsurgery
strategic business unit was down year-on-year to slightly below the Group average.

Due to the strong earnings performance, cash flows from operating activities for fiscal year 2020/21 rose to
€362.7m (prior year: €178.5m), which is a significant increase compared with the prior year.

Free cash flow increased significantly in fiscal year 2020/21 to €380.7m (prior year: €185.8m). EVA® increased
from €68.5m in the prior year to €214.1m.

In order to maintain its innovative strength and ensure future growth, the Company invests continuously in

research and development. In fiscal year 2020/21 R&D expense ratio went down to 14.1% of revenue
(prior year: 16.4%). The decline is primarily due to the strong revenue growth.

Revenue

In fiscal year 2020/21, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group increased its revenue significantly by +23.3% to €1,646.8m
(prior year €1,335.5m). Currency effects had a material adverse effect, however; currency-adjusted growth
amounted to +26.5%. Both strategic business units contributed, as did all regions, although the strongest
growth rates were achieved in the APAC region.

Due to the gradual easing of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, bolstered in part by the global vaccination
campaigns, demand increased significantly. Given the capacity bottlenecks that remain to some extent in the
supply chains, there was a temporary increase in production and lead times for a number of key products in the
equipment business. Both strategic business units were affected by this. Orders received therefore increased
even more significantly than revenue in fiscal year 2020/21, from €1,340.5m to €1,731.0m (+29.1%; adjusted
for currency effects: +32.6%).

® By way of ad hoc disclosures on 19 April 2021 and again on 16 July 2021, the Company's management firmed up and increased its forecast
published on 11 December 2020 for fiscal year 2020/21, due to the further normalization of demand following the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic in fiscal year 2020/21

2018/19 1,459.3/13.9

a) Revenue by strategic business unit

The strategic business unit Ophthalmic Devices accounted for more than three quarters (76.3%) of the
Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's total revenue in the fiscal year under review (prior year: 74.2%). The strategic
business unit Microsurgery generated 23.7% (prior year: 25.8%) of total revenue.

Share of strategic business units in revenue of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group in fiscal year 2020/21

Ophthalmic Devices 76.3%

Microsurgery 23.7%

Revenue of the SBU Ophthalmic Devices was significantly higher compared with the prior year, increasing by
+26.8% (adjusted for currency effects: +29.8%) to €1,255.7m (prior year: €990.6m).

Once again, the refractive lasers business proved to be a growth driver, benefiting in particular from high
levels of procedure-dependent revenue, as well as good demand in Surgical Ophthalmology. The segment for
devices and systems for diagnostics also made a positive contribution to the development of revenue

Revenue from consumables and services (recurring revenue), increased further in fiscal year 2020/21. The
proportion of recurring revenue in the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group’s total revenue amounted to 41.0% for fiscal
year 2020/21 (prior year: 38.8%).

Orders received increased from €996.3m to €1,318.8m, also to a greater extent than revenue (+32.4%;
adjusted for currency effects: +35.7%). This was attributable, among other things, to a strong recovery of
demand as well as the increase in production and lead times for a number of key products due to the still
limited capacities in the supply chains and materials procurement as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic

Revenue in the SBU Microsurgery amounted to €391.1m for fiscal year 2020/21, an increase of +13.4%
compared with the prior year (prior year: €344.8m). Adjusted for currency effects, this revenue growth
amounted to +17.1%. At the start of fiscal year 2020/21 revenue in the strategic business unit Microsurgery
was still declining, due in particular to continued restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, while
orders received had already reached the level of the prior year on a currency-adjusted basis and were showing
a positive trend again at the half-year mark. Over the further course of fiscal year 2020/21 there were
further noticeable trend improvements compared with the prior-year quarters, which led, accompanied by an
accelerated recovery of sales in the second half of fiscal year 2020/21, to a significant increase in revenue
again compared with the prior year.

Orders received in Microsurgery increased by +19.7% (adjusted for currency effects: +23.8%) from €344.2m
to €412.2m. This was attributable, among other things, to a strong recovery of demand as well as the

Revenue in the EMEA region increased by +19.4%, from €362.4m to €432.6m. After adjustment for currency
effects, this Increase amounted to +21.2%. The core markets Germany, France and the countries of Southern
Europe, and the UK, demonstrated a solid performance, in spite of the remaining COVID-19 restrictions
during the year, particularly in the area of distribution and marketing

Revenue in the Americas region increased by +16.9%, to €448.9m (prior year: €384.0m). After adjustment
for currency effects, this Increase amounted to +23.9%. Although the U.S. business was already almost at
the prior-year level at the beginning of fiscal year 2020/21, the economy has recovered further, also because
of the progressive vaccination coverage and an accompanying steady acceleration of sales since the second
quarter of the fiscal year.

Revenue in the APAC region increased significantly due to good contributions to growth, especially from
China and South Korea. The fact that this region was less impacted overall by COVID-19 restrictions compared
with the EMEA and Americas regions in the fiscal year under review also had a positive effect in this respect
With revenue growth of +29.9% (adjusted for currency effects: +31.6%), revenue increased to €765.3m (prior
year: €589.0m). The countries of Southeast Asia also performed well, while the development of revenue in
Japan was more or less stable compared with the prior year, but increased at an accelerated rate particularly
in the fourth quarter.

Gross profit

Gross profit in fiscal year 2020/21 amounted to €967.2m (prior year: €745.5m). The gross margin reached
58.7% in the reporting period (prior year: 55.8%). The strong revenue growth and a favorable product mix
with a higher proportion of case-number-dependent business, particularly in the Ophthalmic Devices SBU,
contributed to a positive margin trend.

Functional costs

Functional costs increased to €596.0m in the year under review (prior year: €568.0m), mainly due to the
strong sales performance and an increase in research and development expenses. This 4.9% increase was
significantly lower than the increase in revenue. The share of functional costs in revenue declined to 36.2%
compared with 42.5% in the prior year.

» Selling and marketing expenses: There was only a slight increase in selling and marketing expenses in
the fiscal year under review, from €292.8m to €303.2m, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting
restrictions, especially for sales-related advertising and travel activities. Relative to revenue, selling and
marketing expenses ratio was below the previous year's level, at 18.4% (prior year: 21.9%).

» General administrative expenses: Expenses in this area amounted to €60.7m (prior year: €56.3m). Relative
to revenue, there was a slight decline in the share of general administrative expenses compared with the
prior year, to 3.7% (prior year: 4.2%).

» Research and development expenses: The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group invests continuously in R&D, in order
to further develop its product portfolio and ensure further growth. R&D expenses increased to €232.1m
in the reporting period (prior year: €218.8m). Due to the strong development of revenue, the R&D ratio
remained significantly behind the prior-year period, at 14.1% (prior year: 16.4%).

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group uses earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT = operating result) as a key
performance indicator. The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group generated earnings before interest and taxes of
€373.6m in the reporting period (prior year: €177.6m). The strong revenue growth as well as a favorable
product mix with a high proportion of recurring revenue contributed to a positive margin trend. In addition,
the persistently low selling and marketing expenses due to to the COVID-19 pandemic benefited the
development of earnings compared with the prior year. The EBIT margin increased from 13.3% in the prior
year, to 22.7%.

In the SBU Ophthalmic Devices, the EBIT margin increased mainly as a result of a more favorable product mix
with a higher proportion of recurring revenue. At 22.9% (prior year: 9.7%), it was still above the EBIT margin
for the Company as a whole. The EBIT margin in the strategic business unit Microsurgery decreased slightly
and, at 22.0% (prior year: 23.7%), was slightly lower than the EBIT margin for the Group as a whole. Aside
from the more restrained sales trend, particularly at the beginning of fiscal year 2020/21, this was also largely
due to the lower proportion of recurring revenue compared with the strategic business unit Ophthalmic
Devices.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) amounted to €435.2m for the fiscal year
under review (prior year: €238.0m). At 26.4%, the EBITDA margin was up year-on-year (prior year: 17.8%).

Net interest income and interest expenses amounted to -€7.0m in the reporting period (prior year: -€25.8m).
Interest expenses mainly include the annual interest cost of the liability arising from the contingent purchase
price obligation for lanTECH Inc. as well as the adjustment of capital costs for the measurement of this liability.

Currency effects amounting to €-25.1m arose within the financial result in fiscal year 2020/21 as a result of
foreign currency losses on hedges (prior year: currency effects of €4.5m due to foreign currency gains on
currency hedges), due in particular to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the Chinese
renminbi. The other financial result of €-1.7m was influenced in fiscal year 2020/21 mainly by the remeasurement
of the contingent purchase price obligation arising from the acquisition of lanTECH, Inc. (prior year: €23.1m).

The tax rate for the reporting period was 29.9% (prior year: 30.9%). As a general rule, an average annual tax
rate of around 30% is assumed.

Consolidated profit attributable to the shareholders of the parent company amounted to €236.3m for fiscal
year 2020/21 (prior year: €122.4m). Non-controlling interests accounted for €1.2m (prior year: €1.0m). In
fiscal year 2020/21, basic earnings per share of the parent company amount to €2.64 (prior year: € 1.37).

* Write-downs on intangible assets arose from the purchase price allocations (PPA), mainly in connection with the acquisitions of lanTECH, Inc.
in fiscal year 2018/19 and Aaren Scientific Inc. in fiscal year 2013/14. There was also a one-time positive effect in fiscal year 2020/21 resulting
from the proceeds from the sale of a property.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Financial position

Objectives and principles of financial management
A key objective of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's financial management is to safeguard liquidity and increase
this efficiently throughout the Group.

For the Group, operative business is the main source of liquidity for the individual business units, which is also
reflected in its strategic orientation and financial activities. The Company therefore operates a global financial
management system that encompasses all of its subsidiaries and is centrally organized at Group level. The
Company also strives to continuously improve its financial power and reduce financial risks by keeping a constant
check on the solvency of its debtors, which also involves the use of financial instruments.

The Company deposits any liquidity it does not require at normal market conditions with the treasury of

Carl Zeiss AG. When investing surplus liquidity, short-term availability generally comes before the goal of
maximizing earnings, so that funds can be accessed quickly if, for example, acquisition opportunities arise. The
Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has production plants in the USA, Europe and China. This means that the influence
of exchange rate fluctuations can be reduced. The remaining currency risk is hedged by simple futures trading.
Details on this can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under “(2) (i) Financial
instruments”, “(27) Additional disclosures on financial instruments”, “(37) Financial risk management’, “(2) (u)”
and “(35) Related party disclosures” and in the annual financial statements of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG under

4 “Information and explanatory notes on accounting and valuation principles”, paragraph “Derivative financial
instruments” and 8 “Receivables from affiliated companies”.

Financial management
The ratio of borrowed capital to equity amounts to 42.8% as of 30 September 2021 (prior year: 38.9%).

The Company's dynamic gearing ratio was -0.7 years for fiscal year 2020/21 (prior year: -0.8 years)®.

The interest coverage ratio, i.e., the coverage of interest income by the operating result before depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA), amounted to 55.8 (prior year: 9.0).

Cash inflows generated from operating activities provide another important source of financing for the
Carl Zeiss Meditec Group. Furthermore, the Company has the option to assume loans, either from the treasury
of Carl Zeiss AG or from banks.

For further information on the financial liabilities of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group please refer to note "(24)
Non-current financial liabilities", "(25) Current accrued liabilities" and "(26) Other current non-financial liabilities’
in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the annual financial statements of
Carl Zeiss Meditec AG under 8 “Receivables from affiliated companies” and 14 “Liabilities”.

As the Company possesses sufficient cash funds to finance its operating and strategic objectives, changes in
credit conditions do not currently have any material effect on its financial position.

Separate reporting on financial instruments

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is exposed to currency fluctuation risks, due to its international business activities
in numerous different currencies. Significant currency risks are hedged against with hedging transactions, based
on a rolling business plan

8 Calculation: borrowings excluding non-controlling interests, less cash and cash equivalents and less treasury receivables/cash flows from
operating activities.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Hedges are mainly transacted centrally by Carl Zeiss Financial Services GmbH. The services provided by

Carl Zeiss Financial Services GmbH to Carl Zeiss Meditec AG and its subsidiaries are regulated by corresponding
general agreements. The hedges are processed by Carl Zeiss Financial Services GmbH with external business
banks. Hedges are entered into solely via banks with high credit ratings given by leading agencies. The
business transactions are executed with strict separation of functions between the front office (trade), middle
office (financial risk management, controlling) and back office (processing, documentation).

Value-at-risk analyses, together with scenario, sensitivity and stress test analyses, are implemented in risk
control and monitoring, to quantify the currency risks. Hedging rates are specified for operative control of
all relevant currencies. Limits were defined to limit risks relating to contracting parties and transaction types.
Derivative financial instruments are exclusively used for hedging purposes.

Statement of cash flows

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's statement of cash flows shows the origin and utilization of the cash flows
during a fiscal year. A distinction is made between cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from
investing and financing activities

Changes in individual items in the income statement and the statement of financial position are recorded in
the statement of cash flows. In contrast, the consolidated statement of financial position presents the figures
as they stood at the end of the reporting period on 30 September 2021. As a result, the statements in the
analysis of the financial position may differ from the presentation of net assets based on the consolidated
statement of financial position

Change in cash and cash 12

equivalents 16.4

Cash flows from operating activities amounted to €362.7m in the fiscal year under review, mainly due to
the positive development of earnings (prior year: €178.5m). There was no further increase in inventories,
which had a positive effect in fiscal year 2020/21. This was in contrast with stockpiling of certain products
and components in the prior year, to ensure deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic. An increase in trade
payables also had a positive effect on the development of cash flow. This was offset by a sales-related
increase in trade receivables.

Cash flow from investing activities amounted to €-75.2m in fiscal year 2020/21 (prior year: €-70.9m) and
arose primarily from investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets due, among other
things, to the capitalization of research and development expenses. There was also a cash outflow arising,
among other things, from the purchase price obligations in connection with the acquisition of lanTECH, Inc.
in fiscal year 2018/19 and Photono Oy in fiscal year 2019/20. A cash inflow was generated, among other
things, from the proceeds from the sale of a property.

BACK TO CONTENTS

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Cash flows from financing activities amounted to €-285.9m in the fiscal year under review (prior year:
€-123.0m). The higher cash outflow in fiscal year 2020/21 is mainly attributable to an increase in treasury
receivables from the treasury Carl Zeiss AG

Free cash flow increased in fiscal year 2020/21 to €380.7m (prior year: €185.8m). Net cash? rose to
€939.9m (prior year: €708.2m).

Investment and depreciation policy

Continuous investments are required to further expand the Company's market position in the medical
technology sector. A distinction is made between two types of investment: capacity expansions and replacement
investments. These investments are primarily financed from cash flow from operating activities.

The production of devices and systems at the Company is generally restricted to the integration of individual
components to create system solutions. For this reason, investments in property, plant and equipment are
comparatively low. One exception, however, is the production of intraocular lenses, which generally demands
higher investments due to a larger vertical range of manufacture.

Nevertheless, the required investment of capital in real assets is limited within the Company, which is evident
from the development of the capex ratio — the ratio of total investments’? in property, plant and equipment
(cash) to consolidated revenue. In fiscal year 2020/21, it was 1.8% (prior year: 2.2%).

At Carl Zeiss Meditec AG and its subsidiaries intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are subject
to scheduled, straight-line amortization and depreciation, respectively, over their estimated useful lives.
Further details on this can be found in note "(2) (g) Other intangible assets" and "(2) (h) Property, plant and
equipment" in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and in note 5 “Fixed assets”
in the annual financial statements of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG.

NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Sustainability

Traditionally, the Company attaches great importance to commitment to the common good and the environment.
In the opinion of the company management, social responsibility does not just shape corporate culture
internally, but also plays an important role externally.

The sustainability management system of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is integrated in the sustainability
strategy of the ZEISS Group.

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG therefore makes use of the option under Section 289b (2) HGB and Section 315b (2)
HGB to exempt itself from issuing a non-financial statement and the non-financial consolidated statement,
and refers to the separate summary non-financial report of the parent company, Carl Zeiss AG, into which
Carl Zeiss Meditec AG has been incorporated. This separate, non-financial report, which applies for the entire
ZEISS Group shall be available for inspection, in German and English, from 15 December 2021 at

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Compliance

As a company of the ZEISS Group, the Company's management considers integrity and compliance to be

of paramount importance for the global reputation of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group. A basic requirement

for growth and success is having the trust of external stakeholders in responsible, law-abiding and ethical
conduct. As a company of the ZEISS Group, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG has joined the compliance management
system of Carl Zeiss AG. The compliance management system ensures compliance with laws and regulations
and adherence to internal policies by stipulating processes and guidelines. A centralized and a decentralized
approach is taken for this. Carl Zeiss AG develops guidelines and training documents, which are applied at the
level of the subsidiaries (i.e., also at Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). ZEISS employees are encouraged to report any
breach of the compliance requirement, or any grounds for suspicion of a breach. The notification management
system for compliance incidents guarantees the anonymity of each informant and regulates the review,
documentation and intervention in substantiated allegations. The ZEISS Code of Conduct containing the basic
rules of good and fair conduct in competition and in dealing with our employees and customers, which has
applied globally since 2007 and was updated in April 2020, is also adhered to. The Code of Conduct sets out
the fundamental ethical principles of good conduct and values which govern the actions of both management
and employees in their day-to-day work at the Company. Compliance was defined as an essential component
of ZEISS Policy, which every business activity must conform to.

Production

Production plants

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group manufactures its products in Jena, Oberkochen and Berlin in Germany, Dublin
and Ontario in the USA, Guangzhou in China, and La Rochelle in France. The Company also has a number of
smaller sites in Besancon, France, Livingston, Scotland, and Goodlands, Mauritius. Systems and devices for
ophthalmology are manufactured in Jena and Dublin. The Company manufactures microsurgical visualization
solutions and phacoemulsification systems in Oberkochen; intraocular lenses are manufactured in La Rochelle,
Berlin and Ontario. Certain product groups are manufactured by partners, who either have more favorable
cost structures or special production processes, or technologies that can realize economies of scale in
purchasing.

Production concept

In production, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group focuses on the integration of modules and system components,
which are largely procured from external partners. In the case of intraocular lenses, however, there is a higher
vertical range of manufacture. Production of these largely takes place in-house at the Company. Only a few
specific production steps are undertaken by external companies. In order to reduce dependency on individual
suppliers, the Company continuously strives to qualify additional suppliers for key components or product
groups when selecting suppliers.

The main focus with regard to production processes is primarily on responding quickly to customer inquiries
and requirements by using short decision paths and bringing innovations quickly and efficiently into production.
Shorter throughput times and the reduction of inventories while simultaneously optimizing manufacturing
costs and improving product quality and delivery performance play a major role in this.

Production planning

Production planning in Jena, Oberkochen and Dublin is based on the rolling forecast method. This is done
mostly on a monthly or quarterly basis. This sales forecast is then translated into a demand forecast for
production units, taking inventory changes into account. In order to keep stocks to a minimum, system
integration is generally on a make-to-order basis.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

In order to ensure uninterrupted supplies for customers in the refractive lasers segment, stocks of consumables
are maintained to meet the planned sales volume for at least three months. This is particularly important as
customers cannot use their equipment without consumables. They are therefore served from existing stocks in
accordance with the first-in-first-out principle.

The rolling forecast method described above is also applied for the manufacture of intraocular lenses. As
customers expect very short delivery times for implants, limited quantities of the finished products are stockpiled.
For this purpose, replacement orders from customers are serviced from a central distribution center.
Replenishment orders are then triggered directly to these production sites, so that other customers can be
served as quickly as possible. The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group also operates consignment warehouses in clinics
and hospitals, which — depending on consumption — are continuously restocked

Research and development

Objectives and focus of research and development
Innovations are a key driver of future growth. Research and development has therefore traditionally played a
crucial role within the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group.

The Company is committed to continuously expanding its product range and to improving products that

are already on the market. In doing so, the Company strives to establish products as new gold standards in
medical diagnostics and therapy. The focus is to make the customer's workflows more efficient by integrating
solutions, and to improve clinical results. A key element of the Company’s research and development work is
close collaboration with its customers right from the early stages of product development.

In fiscal year 2020/21, research and development expenses increased by 6.1% to €232.1m (prior year:
€218.8m). Due to the strong sales trend, the R&D ratio was lower than the prior-year period, at 14.1% (prior
year: 16.4%). Primary development costs of €32.7m continued to be capitalized. Further information can be
found in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

2020/21 2321/1
2019/20 218.8/16.4
2018/19 173.3/11.9

In the reporting period, 19% (prior year: 19%) of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's entire workforce was working
in Research and Development. To a limited extent, research and development services are procured from

Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen and its subsidiaries. In fiscal year 2020/21 the expenses incurred for this amounted
to 20.0% (prior year: 14.7%) of total research and development expenses.

Focus of research and development activities in the reporting period
Research and development at the Company mainly focuses on:

» examining new technological concepts in terms of their clinical relevance and effectiveness;

» the continuous development of the existing product portfolio;

» the development of new products and product platforms based on the available basic technologies and

» digital networking of systems and equipment to increase diagnostic and treatment efficiency and improve
treatment outcomes for patients.

Brands and patents

The Company invests in innovations and solutions and protects its innovations with patents. The Carl Zeiss
Meditec Group currently owns more than 900 patent families worldwide (prior year: more than 900). An
average of two patents a week were granted for the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group in fiscal year 2020/21. Although
the protection for a patent varies from country to country, the Company still strives to protect products in the
various markets as comprehensively as possible with patents. As a number of products have already been

on the market for some time, patent protection does not always extend to the basic functionality of these
products, but also to specific features and enhancements that protect beneficial solutions.

In addition, the Company has 750 registered brands (prior year: 662) and brand registrations (as of
30 September 2021). These include, among others, product names, slogans, images, logos and other specific
characteristics of the Company.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF CARL ZEISS MEDITEC AG

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG is the parent company of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group. Its results are influenced to a
large extent by its subsidiaries. The development of business is generally subject to the same opportunities
and risks as the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group. The outlook for the Group also largely mirrors the expectations for
Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, due to the links between Carl Zeiss Meditec AG and its subsidiaries and due to the
importance of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG within the Group. The foregoing explanations for the Carl Zeiss Meditec
Group therefore also apply for Carl Zeiss Meditec AG.

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG's key priority is to secure the Company's long-term and successful development and
to ensure the necessary liquidity. A key benchmark for this is the management of profitable growth at Group
level

Preparation of the financial statements

The following annual financial statements of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG have been prepared in accordance with
the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB), in contrast to the consolidated financial statements,
which conform to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as they are to be applied in the EU

Summary of business development

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG ended fiscal year 2020/21 with a growing revenue and earnings; thus, the growth
trend of previous years continued again in the fiscal year under review. The business recovered from the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Revenue increased by 30.6% compared with the prior year. Exchange rate fluctuations had no material effect
overall on the development of revenue. EBIT (gross profit less selling and general administrative expenses,
R&D expenses and other operating expenses, plus other operating income) increased by €121.8m year-on-
year to €288.8m (prior year: €167.0m). The EBIT margin therefore increased by 6.3 percentage points, from
19.5% in the prior year, to 25.8%.

Results of operations

Revenue increased by 30.6% year-on-year to €1,120.0m (prior year: €857.5m). Overall, currency translations
had no material effect on the increase in sales. Sales include €4.6m in service revenue pursuant to

Section 277 (1) HGB.

Gross profit in fiscal year 2020/21 increased from €483.0m to €668.8m. The corresponding margin increased

by 3.4 percentage points to 59.7% (prior year: 56.3%).

Selling expenses in the fiscal year amounted to €120.5m, general and administrative expenses amounted

to €35.1m. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in absolute terms in the fiscal year under
review, which is mainly due to the higher business volume and an increase in travel and trade fair activities
again. Carl Zeiss Meditec AG's research and development expenses in fiscal year 2020/21 amounted to €209.1m
(prior year: €164.4m). Detailed information on the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's research and development
activities can be found on in the section entitled Research and development of the management report.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

The increase in other operating income mainly results from foreign currency gains and reversals of write-
downs on receivables from the subsidiary Carl Zeiss Meditec Iberia S.A, details of which can be found in the
accompanying notes to the annual financial statements of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG in the note on “Fixed assets”.

Other operating expenses increased mainly as a result of foreign currency losses. Income from long-term
equity investments results from the dividend payment of Carl Zeiss Meditec Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. Income
from profit and loss transfer agreements originated from the subsidiary Carl Zeiss Meditec Asset Management
Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH, Jena, Germany. Further information on this can be found in the notes to the
annual financial statements of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG in the note on "Income from profit and loss transfer

agreements"

The write-down of long-term financial assets relates to InfiniteVision Optics $.A.S., Strasbourg, France. Further
details can be found in the notes to the annual financial statements of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG in the note on

"Fixed assets"

The decrease in interest and similar expenses within the financial result mainly relates to pension obligations.

The result before tax thus increased to €293.0m compared with €155.7m in the prior year. Net income for

the fiscal year under review amounts to €196.9m (prior year: €102.7m).

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Net assets and results of operations

Pursuant to German commercial law (HGB), the total assets of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG amounted to €1,814.1m
as of 30 September 2021. This corresponds to an increase of 13.8% compared with the prior year (€1,594.6m).

Long-term financial assets increased due in particular to an addition to shares in affiliated companies resulting
from a capital increase at Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, USA, in return for which a long-term intercompany
loan was partially repaid. Inventories remained almost the same, at €161.7m, compared with the prior-year
figure of €161.9m. Receivables and other assets increased year-on-year, due in particular to the increase in
volume sales associated with the recovery of the business from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cash and cash equivalents consist exclusively of bank balances. Term deposit balances are deposited with the
Group treasury of Carl Zeiss AG and are recognized under "Receivables from affiliated companies".

Net retained profits increased by the net income for the fiscal year of €196.9m, less the dividend paid of
€44.7m.

Provisions increased to €126.4m (prior year: €92.7m). This was mainly due to higher provisions for currency
forward contracts. Further information can be found in the notes to the annual financial statements of

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG under "Provisions". Liabilities increased mainly in the area of trade payables due to the
higher purchasing volumes.

The debt ratio (ratio of borrowed capital to equity) increased slightly to 15.9% as of 30 September 2021
(prior year: 12.9%).

Cash inflows generated from operating activities provide important sources of financing for Carl Zeiss Meditec AG.
The Company can also create additional liquidity by issuing new shares on the capital market. Furthermore,
the Company has the option to assume loans, either from the treasury of Carl Zeiss AG or from banks. As
Carl Zeiss Meditec AG has enough cash funds at its disposal to finance its operating and strategic objectives,
changes in interest rates and credit conditions are not currently having any material effect on the Company's
financial position

The Company's management considers Carl Zeiss Meditec AG's net assets and financial position to be solid.
They contribute toward the achievement of the Company's objectives which are focused on sustainable
growth.

Employees

As of 30 September 2021, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG had 1,547 employees. This number does not include
Management Board members.

REMUNERATION REPORT
Remuneration report of the Management Board

The members of the Management Board are remunerated based on Section 87 German Stock Corporation Act
(Aktiengesetz). According to this, the Supervisory Board determines the remuneration, which comprises fixed
and variable components, and payments in kind. The Supervisory Board’s General Committee proposes the
amount and structure of the remuneration to be paid to the Management Board, and these are then approved
by the Supervisory Board as a whole. The appropriateness of the Management Board remuneration is based on
the duties and the personal contribution of the individual members of the Management Board, as well as the
Company's overall financial position and the market environment.

At its meeting on 3 December, the Supervisory Board addressed the achievement of objectives by the
Management Board members for fiscal year, and stipulated the relevant variable remuneration 3 December 2020.
At its meeting on 14 April 2021, at the recommendation of the General Committee, the Supervisory Board
resolved upon the key points of the new Management Board remuneration system in accordance with the
provisions of Section 87a AktG, for presentation at the Annual General Meeting on 27 May 2021. The
remuneration system for the Management Board was adopted by the Annual General Meeting on 27 May 2021
as planned, achieving an approval rating of 95.91% of the share capital present.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Structure and amount of remuneration paid to the Management Board

The remuneration paid to the Management Board of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG consists of a fixed and a variable
portion. The variable portion is split into two components: the first component is contingent upon the
achievement of certain targets for the respective current fiscal year and the second bears a long-term incentive
effect.

The fixed portion of the remuneration paid to the Management Board is not contingent upon the achievement
of certain targets. It is paid monthly.

The variable portion of the remuneration, which relates to targets set for the respective fiscal year, is
contingent upon the achievement of certain quantitative targets. The main quantitative targets are Economic
Value Added® (EVA®) and free cash flow. This portion of the remuneration is paid after the end of the respective
fiscal year. The amount is contingent upon the degree of target fulfillment.

In addition to the two components of Management Board remuneration described above, there is also a
so-called Long Term Incentive Program (LTI).

This program offers a remuneration component with a long-term incentive, which allows the members of

the Management Board to annually earn an additional income after a three-year period. This amounts to
40% of the individual short-term variable remuneration for the fiscal year that precedes the beginning of the
term of an LTI tranche, plus interest. A precondition for payment of this remuneration is that the members

of the Management Board have not handed in their notice at the end of the applicable three-year period per
tranche, and the equity ratio of the ZEISS Group is higher than 20% at this point. The first payment was made
in December 2014. The next payment is forecast for December 2021.

Contrary to the general LTI regulation, a different regulation applies for the Chairman of the Management
Board with respect to the long-term variable remuneration. Accordingly, financial targets (EVA®, free cash
flow) are agreed annually for a three-year period. The targets are settled at the end of the period

the Chairman of the Audit Committee receive one-and-a-half times this amount. With the exception of the
members of the Nominating Committee and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the General Committee,
members of committees receive an additional, fixed remuneration of €5,000. In addition to this, the Annual

Risk management

The central risk management system of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group stipulates uniform regulations and
processes for the early detection, assessment and management of risks. In the subsidiaries and on Group level,
risk management coordinators are responsible for applying the policies and procedures. The management
of the subsidiaries detects and manages operating and strategic risks. Overall responsibility lies with the
Management Board, which regularly assesses risks and their management at Group level together with the
Group Risk Manager. The Management Board and Supervisory Board review the appropriateness and
monitoring of the risk management system.

Risk management is an integral part of corporate governance within the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group, and is
based on the following two key components: a risk reporting system and an internal control system.

Risk reporting system

This is a clearly structured, traceable feedback loop which encompasses all of the Company's activities, is
integrated in its organizational structure and its control and reporting processes, and comprises a systematic
and ongoing process for the identification, assessment, management/control, as well as the documentation
and communication of any risks. Any relevant information can therefore be immediately passed on to the
responsible decision makers. The main features of this system are as follows:

» The risk reporting system exclusively records risks. It integrates all fully consolidated subsidiaries

» The business risks are assessed and categorized according to their potential implications over the period
of their existence, and according to their probability of occurrence and damage potential. The period of
assessment is a maximum of five years. The risks are evaluated in respect of their effect on earnings before
interest and tax.

» Regular risk reports are provided to the Management Board, the management of the subsidiaries and other
decision-makers within the Company on the basis of specified thresholds. Significant risks arising at very
short notice are reported to this responsible group immediately.

» On this basis, the Group takes and evaluates appropriate measures to avoid identified risks, reduce their
probability of occurrence or reduce the economic damage they could cause. The measures to reduce
risks, the early warning indicators and the residual risks derived from these are regularly updated and
documented.

Internal control system

The internal control system of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is based on the COSO Enterprise Risk Management
Model (COSO ERM model). The Group's integrated enterprise risk management system covers strategic and
operational risks, i.e., risk assessment goes beyond mere financial risks. For central processes, there are key
risks and defined control mechanisms, which are regularly evaluated with regard to their effectiveness. The
Management Board is responsible for ensuring an appropriate and effective internal control system and for
continuously improving it. The Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of internal
auditing, risk management and the internal control system, as well as the accounting process. The accounting-
related part of the internal control system is a system structured within the sphere of responsibility and
under the supervision of the CFO, which ensures that the preparation of the consolidated annual financial
statements is in line with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), and that external financial
reporting is reliable.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Significant risks

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group analyzes and assesses risks systematically. Special emphasis is placed on potential
economic effects and on probability of occurrence. In this way, the risks are quantified and classified. Due to
the broad portfolio and the Group’s global presence, the strategic and operational risks are highly diversified.

Quantitative data is based on a net perspective after application of measures, and relates to the risk assessment
period

Innovation risks

The business success and reputation of the Group are heavily dependent on the rapid development of
innovative products and solutions. New trends and current scientific and research findings can trigger technology
shifts and new customer requirements, and make new business models necessary. Should the Group lose
touch with technological developments on the market, react too late to trends or technological advancements,
this could weaken its competitive position. There is also a risk of the Group's products being completely
superseded by alternative technologies, procedures or treatment methods, thus reducing demand for certain
products, which could result in losses in sales and earnings. The potential negative impact these risks could
have on earnings equates to an amount in the low-single-digit million euro range.

In order to exploit opportunities in this area early and keep the probability of occurrence and the economic
impact of this risk low in all segments, the Group invests heavily in research and development and upstream
areas of products with a technological edge and unique selling points.

Personnel risks

Demographic change and the shortage of skilled staff for technical jobs as well as the differing training and
qualifications standards around the globe are creating new challenges when it comes to filling job vacancies.
Unfilled positions could limit the technological advancement and sale of the products and services it offers

in all segments. The Group is countering this with its recruitment strategy and employee development and
successor planning, thus keeping the probability of occurrence low. In order to retain skilled employees in the
long term, the Group offers various social benefits depending on the location — these include, for example,
offers for health promotion or child care. At the current time, the management does not expect these risks to
have any material effects on the Group's net assets, financial position or results of operations.

Risks in procurement and production

The Group ensures compliance with national and international standards, guidelines and legal requirements
with regard to its supply chain through an integrated management system that addresses the issues of quality,
the environment, and occupational health and safety.

In some cases, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group uses components from external suppliers to manufacture its
products in all business segments. The increase in the prices of commodities, energy and materials, the growing
complexity of purchased parts and the limited number of suppliers (single source) for certain technologies
could have negative implications for the production, sale and quality of the Company's products. In addition
there is a risk of suppliers canceling or not being able to deliver in full due to the COVID-19 pandemic or due to
the transport and supply bottlenecks being observed worldwide. The Group continues to work on stabilizing
supply chains and reducing the dependence on individual suppliers in order to minimize the associated
economic impact, among other things. Opportunities arising from the bundling of procurement activities
shall also be exploited. Furthermore, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group selects its suppliers according to specific
processes and criteria. By implementing consistent supply chain measures, such as qualifying its suppliers,
identifying secondary suppliers and preparing a strategic stockpiling plan, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group protects
itself against supplier dependencies and changes on the commodities market.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group and the ZEISS Group have close contractual relationships in some areas. This
relates in particular to the procurement of IT services, the licensed use of the "ZEISS" brand and agreements
with distribution companies of the ZEISS Group. This distribution network provides major opportunities, which
are rooted particularly in the close-meshed coverage worldwide and an efficient market development approach.

The potential effect of supplier risks on earnings is in the low single-digit million euro range.

Risks of information technology

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group continuously reviews and exploits the opportunities of digitalization. This creates
many new possibilities to offer customers additional services. At the same time, the Group constantly updates
its existing information technology (IT) systems, and its IT protection and security systems. Functioning and
adequately documented IT systems are also a prerequisite for obtaining product approvals in certain countries.
Risks that, in the event of damage, could result in an interruption of business processes due to IT system
failures or the loss or falsification of data, are therefore identified and evaluated across the entire life cycle of
the applications and IT systems. Analyses were carried out and measures were taken in this area in particular
during the fiscal year under review, to prevent cyber attacks and virus attacks causing damage to the IT infra-
structure of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG and medical devices at the customer. The management works continuously to
improve its IT security due to the considerable increase in the threat from cybercrime. Depending on the nature
and scope of potential successful cyber attacks, these could have material adverse effects on the Group’s net
assets, financial position and results of operations. Some of the Group’s IT systems are operated by external
partners. The Group has defined standards for these service providers with regard to the hardware and software
used, as well as data security. The Group continuously monitors the implementation of and compliance with
these standards.

Risks from acquisitions

Acquisitions or investments offer the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group the opportunity to expand its portfolio of
expertise and technology, or to increase its access to regional markets. Due in particular to the acquisition of
Carl Zeiss Meditec Cataract Technology, Inc. in December 2018, a company specializing in technical solutions
for microinvasive cataract surgery, the Group will be able to significantly strengthen its technological position
and its product portfolio for cataract surgery in the years ahead

Acquisitions bear the entrepreneurial risk of the acquired company not performing as well economically as
expected in the market, or of the sales and earnings targets being pursued with its acquisition not being reached,
or of intended synergy effects with the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group not being achievable. The Group tracks the
associated risks and opportunities over time. A key element prior to execution of a transaction is a standardized
process for mergers & acquisitions, including a due diligence review to assess the business development that
can be expected. The economic impact and probability of occurrence are therefore small.

The consolidated statement of financial position shows goodwill from acquisitions totaling €328.7m, which is
tested annually for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. A total of €327.8m of this goodwill is attributable
to the Ophthalmic Devices SBU, and €0.9m to the Microsurgery SBU. The impairment tests carried out during
the fiscal year under review did not give any indication of impairment of the goodwill-bearing cash-generating
units (CGUs). Based on the development of business, the Group also anticipates positive results from subsequent
tests. Due to changes in general economic conditions or changes in business models, impairment losses cannot
be ruled out on goodwill recognized for individual or all companies acquired in the past.

Legal risks, patents and intellectual property

The Company's competitiveness depends on the protection of its technological innovations against exploitation
by third parties. Violations of intellectual property and patent protection may compromise any technological
lead and thus competitive advantages in all business segments. The expiry of property rights, particularly
patents, as well as the geographical limitation of property rights could result in new or existing competitors


--- Page 34 ---

BACK TO CONTENTS

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

exploiting the inventions of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group to enter the market or strengthen their market
position. Furthermore, in spite of the measures taken, third parties may still attempt to copy or partly copy
products of the Company, since the unauthorized use of intellectual property is generally difficult to monitor
and copyright laws only provide for limited protection

The Company employs a property rights strategy to protect its technologies and products. If ZEISS patent and
brand rights are infringed by third parties, the Group takes legal steps to counter the associated high financial
risk. Considering the importance of innovation for the Company, such cases can be expected with a certain
degree of probability in future, even though such cases have rarely arisen in the past. When developing
products and technologies, the Group checks whether the rights of a third party could be affected, develops
non-protected solutions, if necessary, and acquires the requisite licenses and rights, or seeks other solutions
by legal contract. Overall, the management does not expect risks in the area of patents and intellectual
property to have any material effects on the Group's net assets, financial position or results of operations.

Legal risks may arise due, among other things, to changes in general legal conditions in the relevant markets
and to legal disputes with competitors, business associates or customers. Pending litigation amounts to a sum
in the low single-digit millions and is not considered to be a substantial threat for the Group. Should it be
necessary, the Group would set up adequate provisions as a precaution. Further details on litigation and
arbitration proceedings involving the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group can be found in note "(31) Contingent liabilities
and other financial commitments" in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

As a listed medical technology company with global operations, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is subject, in
the countries in which the Group operates, to a large number of laws, regulations and guidelines. In order to
ensure compliance with these regulations, these are regularly analyzed for any changes and internal processes
and guidelines are adapted, if necessary. The Company has set out the basic principles of correct conduct

in business activities in a Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees. In order to avoid breaches of
compliance and minimize risks to the Group’s reputation, the Group has established a corporate-wide
compliance organization. Regular training measures are also in place to familiarize the employees with internal
guidelines and make them aware of the negative effects breaches could have. The management does not
expect this to have any material effects on the Group's net assets, financial position or results of operations.

Financial risks

As a result of the European debt crisis there is a latent credit risk concerning business banks at which the

Carl Zeiss Meditec Group holds deposits. However, the Company has taken various measures to mitigate risks.
For example, it has introduced a monitoring procedure to monitor the current situation in the capital markets.
The Company has categorized its financial risks as moderate. The basis for this categorization is the sound
financing structure with an equity ratio of 70.0%, the large reserve of cash and cash equivalents, and strong
cash flows from operating activities. Cash and cash equivalents at the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group are kept in
reserve based on a rolling monthly cash forecast within a fixed planning period, and are managed as part of a
Group-wide ZEISS cash pool.

The financial risks also include liquidity risks, price fluctuation risks for financial instruments and risks associated
with fluctuations in cash flows. These risks and their management are described in note "(37) Financial

risk management" in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. There are no further
significant risks beyond the risks already taken into account in the statement of financial position.

Economic environment

As a company with global operations, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is exposed to developments that pose a
risk to the global economy. Therefore, the general global political situation, major natural disasters, macro-
economic development and market trends in individual regions of the world may have diverse effects on the
Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's chances of success in all business segments.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

The global economic environment, which has become more volatile over the last few years, resulting in greater
overall economic risks, has once again changed for the worse due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns,
entry restrictions, disrupted supply chains, volatile commodity prices and worsening financial conditions have
set off a lasting chain reaction, leading to fears of a global recession far beyond the economic downturn
following the financial crisis of 2008/09. In many countries, the number of cases of COVID-19 have declined
in the course of calendar year 2021 to date, also flanked by vaccination measures and a resumption of
everyday business. There is therefore an expectation that it will not come to renewed large-scale closures,
even with a rise in infections in fall and winter 2021/22. The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group’s business was only
very moderately affected by the adverse effects of the pandemic in the fiscal year under review, and thus
significantly less than expected.

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group took various measures to cushion the negative impacts of the pandemic, such
as optimizing and reducing costs. The Group also remained in close contact with its customers to avoid
another disruption to business during the pandemic measures in the past fiscal year. In addition, digital
marketing and sales activities and digital service activities were expanded, anti-infection components were
developed for own products, and support services for infection control concepts for customers were offered.

Apart from the pandemic, economic development may also be curbed by reduced stability of the EU, as

well as a general economic downturn. Furthermore, an increasingly protectionist economic policy is being
observed in key markets in which the Group operates, such as the USA and China, the future direction of
which is difficult to predict. Escalating trade tensions between China and the USA may have effects on global
growth. There are also local risks and instabilities in emerging markets, such as Turkey or South America,
which may cause global chain reactions.

This trend in the overall economic situation may have an adverse effect on the economic situation of our
customers and their demand for the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's products, which may in turn have an adverse
effect on sales and earnings. The early warning system for risks established by the Company enables these
risks to be identified in good time to allow countermeasures to be initiated. In addition, the Group's inter-
national presence means it is less affected by regional crises, and the highly differentiated product and customer
structure of the Company limits its sales risks. According to current estimates, and in particular due to the
pandemic, there are risks in the macroeconomic environment in the low-double-digit million euro range.

Market and competition

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is exposed to intense competitive pressure in both strategic business units.
Besides the market entry of new competitors, there is also a risk, in the event of significant exchange rate
fluctuations, of competitors from the beneficiary countries being able to offer their products at considerably
lower prices in the market, and therefore improving their competitive position. Some competitors are better
at dealing with competitive pressure, due to their higher total turnover and the financial resources they have
at their disposal.

In addition, existing competitors may be bought up by large, financially strong companies, or form alliances
with each other, which may lead to even greater competitive pressure, lower selling prices, margin pressure
and/or the loss of market shares. The Company prepares itself for such risks by continuously observing and

analyzing the market, in order to be able to react with the necessary foresight.

Health insurance funds, insurance companies or government health schemes reimburse the costs of certain
medical treatments carried out using products of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group. Changes in health care and
reimbursement policy in Germany or abroad and, in particular, austerity measures as a result of the pandemic,
may lead to the denial or reduction of reimbursements, which could reduce the demand for Carl Zeiss Meditec
products. In the case of new products for which reimbursement cannot yet be predicted with certainty,


--- Page 36 ---

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

demand may be considerably dampened by the financial situation of consumers. Refractive surgery is generally
an elective procedure, which patients pay for themselves. Demand therefore depends on general economic
development. In addition, on the customer side, and particularly in the private health care sector, there is a
noticeable increase in the formation of regional and national purchasing alliances, as well as clinic chains.
Such a trend may lead to a fall in selling prices in this customer segment.

Collectively, these market and competition-related risks may impact the Group's earnings by an amount in the
mid-double-digit million euro range. On the other hand, the demographic trend in industrialized countries and
economic development in the rapidly developing economies, as well as the increasing requirements placed

on medical devices for diagnosing and treating age-related eye diseases, present growth opportunities for the
Company.

Product approval and political environment

As the Group sells its products worldwide, statutory regulations have to be taken into consideration when
manufacturing and launching products in the market, especially where explicit regulatory approvals and
certifications are required. Although these requirements are incorporated into all stages of development,
production and distribution, there is no guarantee that such approvals will be granted at all or in time for the
planned launch in the market or that the Group's numerous registrations will still exist or be renewed in the
future. This may lead to sales losses and, in the case of delayed product launches, to competitive disadvantages.
In addition, registration requirements could become more stringent in future, also due in particular to increasing
protectionist tendencies in various countries

In order to be able to identify such developments in good time and respond appropriately, the Company
monitors developments and approval procedures in this area very closely as part of its quality management
system. This is especially the case right now with regard to the new EU medical devices directive, which
entered into force in 2017. Any residual risks that remain move within the single-digit million euro range.

Certified quality management

A vital part of early risk detection is the Group's certified quality management system. Clearly structured and
documented quality management processes ensure not only transparency, but are now a prerequisite in most
markets for obtaining regulatory approval for medical devices. The quality management system employed

by the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group was certified by DQS GmbH Deutsche Gesellschaft zur Zertifizierung von
Managementsystemen and complies with the US standard for Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”), 21 C.FR.
part 820, Quality System Regulation.

Product liability risk

There is a fundamental risk with some of the medical devices and system solutions and implants manufactured
by the Company that, in spite of all reasonable measures being taken by the certified quality management
system and compliance with all legal requirements, malfunctions may result in injury to or adverse effects for
patients. This may be due, among other things, to components and raw materials purchased from external
suppliers not meeting the specified quality requirements. Although no significant product liability claims have
been made against the Company to date, no assurance can be given that Carl Zeiss Meditec will not be
faced with such claims in the future. This may damage the Group’s reputation in the long term and lead to
considerable legal costs, irrespective of whether a claim for damages ultimately materializes. Risk liability
claims can be particularly high, especially in the USA, not to mention the costly recall campaigns that may be
required.

The Company covers itself against potential product liability claims by taking out product liability insurance.
The possibility cannot be completely excluded that the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's existing insurance coverage
may not be sufficient to cover potential claims. Any residual risks that remain are within the low-single-digit
million euro range.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Infrastructure risks

Uncontrollable environmental influences, such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks, may result in an
interruption to business operations at the affected locations, and may prevent the Company from providing
regular production, distribution and other services in these regions and generating the expected earnings. All
business segments could be affected by this. In addition, it could have adverse effects on the Company's
customers domiciled in the affected region and on their willingness to invest, as well as the local suppliers
there and their willingness to supply.

The Company's headquarters, with major research and development departments and other key Group
functions, are located in Germany, a region with a comparatively low risk of natural disasters. A second major
site is located in the Greater San Francisco area in the USA, a region with an increased risk of earthquakes.

In order to minimize potential damage, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has set up a crisis management system,
and has also developed local and central plans for maintaining the functionality of critical business processes
(business continuity plans). For this reason the Company does not expect any material adverse effects on its
net assets, financial position or results of operations.

Risks relating to the Group accounting process

The main risks associated with the accounting process are that the financial statements may not provide a
true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations as a result of unintentional
errors or willful actions, or that there is a delay in publishing these. The accounting would not present a true
and fair view of the Company in this case. Deviations are classified as significant if they could individually or
collectively influence the economic decisions taken by the recipients of the financial statements based on the
financial statements.

In the area of accounting and Group accounting, processes ensure the completeness and accuracy of the
financial statements with regularly reviewed, integrated, preventive and detective controls. All of the Group's
internal accounting and valuation guidelines are collated in an accounting manual, which is available via the
Group's intranet to all of the relevant organizational units and all of the Company's employees, along with
the Group-wide financial reporting calendar. In addition, supplementary procedures, standardized reporting
formats, IT systems and IT-assisted reporting and consolidation processes support the process for uniform and
proper consolidated accounting.

The operative, timely implementation of the systemic requirements is effected by the affected areas of

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG and its subsidiaries. These are supported and monitored by the Carl Zeiss Meditec
Group Finance department. The Group Finance department is responsible for consolidated reporting, including
Group-wide financial and management information, forecasts, budgets and risk reporting. Acts of law,
accounting standards and other pronouncements are continuously analyzed with regard to their relevance
for and impact on the consolidated and annual financial statements.

Additional disclosures pursuant to Section 289 (2) No. 1 HGB, Section 315 (2) No. 1 HGB

In principle, price fluctuation risks cannot be ruled out. However, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group counters
these risks by focusing on product innovations and optimizing its production costs through cost-cutting and
efficiency-enhancing measures. Potential risks of default on trade receivables — particularly given the worsening
global debt situation and a potential risk of bad debt losses as a result — are minimized by means of an active
credit control system. The Group also regularly sets up adequate provisions to cover such risks. On the whole,
however, we consider this to be a limited risk. The ratio of valuation allowances on trade receivables to
consolidated revenue was 0.7% in the fiscal year under review (prior year: 0.9%).

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's financial situation can be considered sound. Cash and cash equivalents
amounted to €7.4m as of the end of the reporting period on 30 September 2021. Added to this are credit
balances recognized as receivables from the treasury of Carl Zeiss AG, in the amount of €949.3m. The Group


--- Page 38 ---

BACK TO CONTENTS

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

also generated cash flows from operating activities of €362.7m in the year under review. From a current
perspective there are therefore no significant liquidity risks.

All cash and cash equivalents, including the balances with the treasury of Carl Zeiss AG, are deposited at banks.
Should it come to a loss of individual banks — due in particular to an increasingly unstable macroeconomic
situation — the balances held there may be endangered. The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group counters this risk by
continuously monitoring the solvency of the banks with which it has a business relationship and by spreading
its assets among several banks via the treasury of Carl Zeiss AG.

As a company with global operations, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group is exposed to the effects of exchange rate
fluctuations. In order to hedge against this currency risk, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group concludes currency
forward contracts based on planned transactions in foreign currency. These contracts generally span a period
of up to one year. Based on current exchange rate fluctuations, currency effects may continue to impact the
financial result depending on the extent of the fluctuations. The notes to the financial statements contain
further details on forward exchange contracts.

Overall assessment of the Company's risk situation

At the time of preparation of this report, there were no discernible risks that could jeopardize the continued
existence of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group. In terms of the overall assessment, there are differences compared
with the prior year in that the Group is faced with a significantly less acute risk situation, especially as it was
less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic than expected. The Management Board continues to see a solid
foundation for further development of the Group and uses a systematic strategy and planning process to
provide the necessary resources to exploit any opportunities that arise.

DISCLOSURES PURSUANT TO SECTION 289 A AND 315 A HGB

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG's subscribed capital amounts to €89,440,570 and is composed of 89,440,570 no-par
value ordinary bearer shares (no-par value shares), each with a theoretical interest in the share capital of €1 per
no-par value share. Each share entitles the bearer to one voting right and an equal share in Company profits.

Other shares or shares with special rights that grant supervisory powers do not exist. Nor are there restrictions
on the part of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG concerning the voting rights or transfer of shares. Furthermore, the
Management Board is not aware of any other agreements concluded, for example, between individual
shareholders.

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG is aware of the following direct and indirect holdings in the capital of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG
that exceed ten percent of the voting rights. Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany, holds, both directly and
indirectly, a total of 59.1% of the voting rights in Carl Zeiss Meditec AG. This corresponds to 52,893,270 no-par
value shares. These include 6.8% of the voting rights or 6,074,256 no-par value shares in Carl Zeiss Meditec AG,
which Carl Zeiss AG holds indirectly via its wholly owned subsidiary Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, USA.

Employees of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG or its affiliated companies pursuant to Section 15 et seqq. AktG, who
participated in the Company via employee share plans concerning the share capital of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG in
prior years, exercise their control rights directly like all other shareholders of the Company.

Pursuant to Section 179 and Section 133 AktG, an amendment to the Articles of Association requires a resolution
by the Annual General Meeting which, in turn, requires a simple majority of the votes cast and a majority
comprising at least three quarters of the share capital represented at the time the resolution is passed. The
Articles of Association may specify a different capital majority; in the case of an amendment to the purpose
of the Company, however, only a larger capital majority may be specified. Art. 25 of Carl Zeiss Meditec AG's

OUTLOOK
Future conditions for business development

Macroeconomic conditions”°

Currently, economists are projecting continued growth of the global economy — albeit at a somewhat

more moderate pace due to the catch-up effects that have already taken place following the recession. It

is expected that supply bottlenecks — such as the shortage of semiconductor chips, for example — will have
adverse effects in the coming year. This forecast is subject to major uncertainties, however. It is not possible
at present to predict exactly how the COVID-19 pandemic will develop. The increased debt as a result of the
pandemic may lead, especially if interest rates increase, to payment defaults or a reluctance to invest.?'

In addition, the tensions between the U.S. and China are increasing the risks to free trade and may adversely
affect global economic development. The rising energy prices are having a positive effect on the economies of
oil and gas producing countries, while the higher prices may put a strain on importing countries.

Future situation in the medical technology industry?”

The Company's management generally expects to see further growth on the medical technology market, as
the factors responsible for this still hold true. In addition to the increase in the global population, key growth
drivers also include a rising proportion of elderly people and a growing percentage of the global population
with access to state-of-the-art medical care. The greater demands being placed on innovative capacity in the
medical technology industry also play an important role. Consequently, the products and procedures of medical
technology manufacturers shall no longer be measured based solely on their effectiveness and safety, but also
on their cost-efficiency. Digitalization is another aspect that has already transformed the structure of the medical
technology industry today. Integrated system solutions for simplified workflows are a key differentiator for
customers. This presents a major opportunity for companies to help design products and solutions in health
care and to thus contribute to better treatment outcomes. In the Company's view, the integration of medical
technology and information technology shall continue to proceed at a fast pace.

If nothing else, the development of the global economy shall influence the growth of the medical technology
industry. Both private customers and public authorities base their investment decisions on it to a certain
extent. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse effect in fiscal year 2019/20, for example because
of the cancellation of postponement of non-urgent eye operations, such as cataract surgery. In fiscal year
2020/21 this economic uncertainty eased significantly, however — procedures in the area of cataract surgery,
for example, have returned to close to their normal level prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the present time, growth in the medical technology industry as a whole is expected to be in the low to
mid-single-digit percentage range in the coming years.

Future development in the strategic business units
of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group

Ophthalmic Devices strategic business unit

In fiscal year 2020/21, the Ophthalmic Devices strategic business unit recorded a significant recovery of revenue
compared with the prior year, which was hampered by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Renewed
growth is expected in fiscal year 2021/22, at least to the same extent as the underlying market. From a current

perspective, and without taking currency effects into account, this corresponds to growth at least in the low
to mid-single-digit percentage range. One uncertainty that remains is the situation regarding the global supply
chains. Due among other things to difficulties in materials procurement, lead times for key products are
currently significantly longer than the long-term averages. The result is an increased order backlog. If it proves
possible to counter these difficulties in the course of fiscal year 2021/22, it will be possible to process existing
orders at a faster pace and thus achieve faster revenue growth. The EBIT margin is likely to decline slightly

in fiscal year 2021/22, due among other things to the anticipated normalization of selling and marketing
expenses in light of the lessening effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The acquisition of Carl Zeiss Meditec Cataract Technology, Inc. in December 2018 offers the potential to
further improve the quality of treatment results and the efficiency of workflows in cataract surgery through
innovative, novel treatment options. The aim of product development is the safe removal of the natural

lens before implantation of an intraocular lens. The development projects initiated in connection with the
acquisition made further progress in fiscal year 2020/21 in the area of clinical trials. The company anticipates
dynamic growth in the cataract surgery market in the coming years. Already today this procedure represents
one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures worldwide.

Microsurgery strategic business unit

In the past fiscal year 2020/21 under review, the strategic business unit Microsurgery recovered significantly
from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and, in particular in the second half of the fiscal year, it achieved
significant, double-digit percentage growth.

The Company expects the Microsurgery strategic business unit to continue to make significant contributions
to earnings in future, too, and is optimistic that it will grow at a faster rate than the underlying market in the
coming fiscal year. From a current perspective, and excluding currency effects, the growth anticipated in fiscal
year 2021/22 will be at least in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range. One uncertainty that remains is
the situation regarding the global supply chains. Due among other things to difficulties in materials procurement,
lead times for key products are currently significantly longer than the long-term averages. The result is an
increased order backlog. If it proves possible to counter these difficulties in the course of fiscal year 2021/22,
it will be possible to process existing orders at a faster pace and thus achieve faster revenue growth. The EBIT
margin is expected to be roughly at the average level for the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group in fiscal year 2021/22.

Future selling markets

As a global Company, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG's aim in the years ahead shall be to maintain as balanced a
distribution of revenue across the individual markets as possible. The Company sees particularly promising
business prospects for the long term in the APAC region, due to the rapid economic growth there. In the
medium term, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG also sees opportunities for further growth in the North American market,
due to the targeted expansion of market shares in the surgical consumables business.

Future research and development activities

The Carl Zeiss Meditec Group invests continuously in research and development projects, in which efficient
and targeted development processes play a key role. The Company searches for new technologies and market
trends, in order to subsequently become established on the market with new solutions. To achieve this,
regional market conditions and the needs of the customers are involved in the development process from the
outset. Investment in digitalization will play an important role in this. R&D expenditure is expected to increase
further in fiscal year 2021/22, to at least a high-single-digit percentage amount (2020/21: €232.1m).

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Future investments

The investment ratio of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group has been largely consistent over the past few years.
Even the investments required to realize growth targets shall not significantly change the current investment
ratio in the coming fiscal year. The Company plans to invest around 3% of its revenue in property, plant and
equipment (cash) in fiscal year 2021/22.

Future dividend policy

Carl Zeiss Meditec AG pursues a long-term and earnings-oriented dividend policy. The Company's management
plans to propose to the Annual General Meeting the distribution of a dividend of €0.90 per share for the past
fiscal year. The dividend ratio would therefore be 34.1% (prior year: 36.5%).

Future employee development

Qualified and highly motivated employees are essential for the Company's success: we need them to be able to
continue to work innovatively and profitably in future. It is crucial to keep investing in the further development
of existing employees in future, and to recruit well qualified specialists and managers. The Company therefore
expects employee growth in the coming periods to correlate with the Company's business development.

Future financial position

Interest income and expenses depend on changes in interest rates on the financial markets. At present, the
Company does not expect any marked improvements in investment conditions in the next two years. Interest
income and interest expenses are thus expected to remain around the prior year's level. As of 30 September
2021, current cash and cash equivalents of around €939.9m are available for financing. Based on this and
the continued expectation of positive business development and a positive cash flow from operating activities
as a result, as well as the possibility to use other financial instruments and sources of financing, if required,
the management considers the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group's financing capacity to be adequate. In fiscal year
2021/22, the aim is to achieve operative cash flow that is at least in low three-digit million range, based on
active working capital management.

Future opportunities

The global medical technology market is characterized by fundamentally sustainable growth. This applies to
both ophthalmology and microsurgery and assures us of good selling conditions for the Company. Additional
opportunities are provided by our product range, which is to be expanded further in the fiscal year ahead.
Our strong financial profile, which safeguards the Company's development against external influences, should
also have a positive effect. Future development shall also include external growth opportunities in some areas.
In a systematic process Carl Zeiss Meditec AG continuously looks for strategically meaningful acquisitions. It is
not possible at this point to say how feasible such opportunities might be.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Overall assertion on future development

At the time of publication of this management report the management of the Carl Zeiss Meditec Group
considers the outlook for the next two fiscal years to be generally positive. This assumption is also based on
the persistent underlying long-term trends already described above. One factor of uncertainty that remains,
in the Company’s estimation, is the aforementioned tense situation surrounding the global supply chains.

The management therefore generally assumes that revenue growth will be at least in line with the market
growth expected for the industry, which, from today's perspective and without taking currency effects into
consideration, will be at least in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range.

A crucial advantage for even greater stability of our overall business is a higher proportion of revenue with
case-number-dependent products and services, since there is generally less fluctuation in these areas than in
the capital goods business, for example. A share of around 41% was achieved in fiscal year 2020/21. From a
current perspective, we expect a further increase in fiscal year 2021/22 and in the medium term.

Carl Zeiss Meditec anticipates further growth in fiscal year 2021/22 that is at least on a par with the market
growth projected for the industry, which, from today’s perspective and without taking currency effects into
consideration, corresponds to growth at least in low to mid-single-digit percentage range. The EBIT margin

is expected to decline slightly compared with the prior-year margin of 22.7%, to within the range of around
19% to 21%, due, among other things, to the anticipated normalization of selling and marketing expenses in
light of the lessening effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the medium term, the Company expects to be able to sustainably establish its EBIT margin at a level above
20% (2020/21: 22.7%). In principle, the growing proportion of recurring revenue offers further upward
potential in this respect. Conversely, there is an ongoing high need for investments, particularly in the areas of
research and development and sales and marketing.

In terms of free cash flow for fiscal year 2021/22, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG is striving for a figure in at least the
low three-digit million range. The Company expects Economic Value Added® (EVA®) in the coming fiscal year
to be slightly below to around the level of fiscal year 2020/21.

Should there be any significant changes in the economic environment currently forecast over the course of
the fiscal year, and should it thus become necessary to amend the statements made here on the development
of business from today's perspective, these amendments shall be published promptly and shall specify our
expectations in more detail.
