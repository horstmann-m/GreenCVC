Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

This management report has been prepared taking into consideration the "Guide of recommendations for
the development of management reports of listed companies", published by the CNMV in July 2013.

1. COMPANY’S STANDING

The company has undergone a major transformation over the last 15 years, staying clearly ahead of the
energy transition in order to tackle the challenges posed by climate change and the need for clean
electricity.

Boasting a track record that spans over 170 years, today Iberdrola is a multinational group leading the
energy sector: the company produces and supplies electricity to some 100 million people in the countries in
which it operates.

IBERDROLA is committed to low-emission energy: it is the leading producer of energy from renewable
sources among the European utilities, a world leader in installed terrestrial wind power and the cleanest
electricity producer in the US, with almost zero emissions. As a result of its environmental commitment and
its stake in the decarbonisation of the economy, it has succeeded in reducing its emissions in Europe by
75% since 2000, reaching levels that are 70% below the average for European companies in its sector.

IBERDROLA, as the energy company of the future, has placed its bets on clean energy, smart grids,
efficient energy storage and the development of customised solutions for customers. And at the centre of
this strategy are the various stakeholder groups, with which it maintains permanent dialogue. In order to
confront the future energy scene with assurance of success, the company places its trust in the digital
transformation, which is based on two main pillars: technology and innovation.

On this basis, I]BERDROLA is now embarking on a new stage of growth, supported by a strong investment
drive essentially in regulated businesses or with long-term contracts, which will provide the security,
stability and visibility that are the hallmarks of the company's business model. Likewise, IBERDROLA will

continue maintaining its social commitments, acting as a driver for the growth and generation of
employment in the countries where it operates, and creating sustainable value for all its stakeholders.

1.1. Governance system

To make its business model as competitive as possible, IBERDROLA has organised the management of its
activities around three global businesses:

Network Business: the grids area, which is responsible for the construction, operation and maintenance of
power lines, substations, transformer substations and other facilities for delivering power from the
production centres to the end user. Among the main targets are:

- Zero accidents.

- Offering an excellent service to customers, based on quality of supply and grid information.

- Maximising efficiency in the operation of the system through operating excellent and digitisation of
assets.

1.3. Iberdrola’s corporate governance model

Corporate governance system

The Corporate Governance System constantly updates its corporate governance system, consisting of By-
aws, the Mission, Vision, and Values of the Iberdrola group, the Corporate Policies, the governance rules

the corporate decision-making bodies and other internal committees, and the other codes, regulations,
and procedures making up and elaborating upon Iberdrola’s regulatory compliance system. In order to
move forward in developing specific aspects of its corporate governance system, the Company promotes
he creation of working groups composed of authorised representatives of the stakeholder group(s)
fected in each case, Company employees and top-level experts in the field concerned.

oT

os

he IBERDROLA group’s commitment to good corporate governance and transparency is reflected in its
Mission, Vision and Values, the bases of which as regards corporate governance are the involvement of
he shareholders in the Company's affairs and maintaining a lead position in the application of best
practices and in transparency.

The general corporate governance policy contains a summary of the basic principles regulating the
corporate governance of the Company and of the Group and of its most important components, all of which
is available at www.iberdrola.com.

Governance model

This duly makes a distinction between the functions of strategy and supervision and those of management
and control:

- The Iberdrola Board, composed of a large majority of independent directors, focuses on defining,
supervising and monitoring the policies, strategies and guidelines to which the group must adhere.

- The chairman of the Board, the chief executive officer and the rest of the management team are
responsible for the group's strategic coordination and organisation, through the distribution,
implementation and monitoring of the general strategy and its basic guidelines.

- In all countries in which the group operates, business is organised and strategically coordinated
through subholding companies, which group investments in energy business operating in the
country concerned and centralise the provision of common services to these companies. The group
also has a subholding to handle all non-energy business.

- The subholdings have boards with independent directors, and their own Audit and Compliance
Committees, Internal Audit departments and Compliance units or departments.

- Parent companies are tasked with ordinary management and effective administration of all lines of
business. They also have boards with independent directors and specific management teams.

This structure, which operates along with the group's business model, fosters global integration of the lines
of business (Networks, Generation and Sales and Renewables), and focuses on maximising operational

efficiency, by implementing best market practices.

1.4. Corporate structure of the Group

oka da Nueva York

Given the nature of the activities carried out by the IBERDROLA Group, its organization responds to the
strategic business units, rather than product and service lines. These businesses are managed
independently, as they respond to different technologies, regulations, and geographic markets (Note 8).

The IBERDROLA Group has a decentralised structure and management model to approximate the
decision taking to places where they should have effect, through the subholding companies and parent
companies of the businesses. In addition, the independence and listed subholding companies’ reinforced
autonomy are guaranteed.

The corporate structure encompasses the Company (IBERDROLA, S.A.), subholding companies and

business parent

IBERDROLA, S.A. (Parent company)

companies.

The Board of Directors of the Company defines and supervises the Group’s policies and strategies
and of the basic guidelines for the management thereof, as well as general oversight of the
development of such policies, strategies and guidelines and of decisions on matters that are
strategically significant at the Group level.

The chairman of the Board of Directors & chief executive officer, with the technical support of the
Operating Committee, the Group’s Business CEO and the rest of the management team, assumes the
duty of organisation and strategic coordination of the Group through the dissemination, implementation
and monitoring of the overall strategy and of the basic management guidelines established by the
Board of Directors.

The Company's and the Group’s governance conforms to the structure described above: separates the
duties relating to strategy, oversight, and control of the Group as a whole, the duties of organisation and
coordination of the businesses in each country and the multinational no-energetic business, as well as
those of day-to-day administration and effective management of each business.

It is established on the following bases:

a) The Board of Directors of the Company, which exclusively exercises holding company duties, has
assigned powers relating to the establishment of the Group’s policies and strategies and of the
basic guidelines for the management thereof, as well as general oversight of the development of
such policies, strategies and guidelines and of decisions on matters that are strategically significant

at the Group level.

b) The chairman of the Board of Directors & chief executive officer of the Company, with the technical
support of the Operating Committee, the Group’s Business CEO and the rest of the management
team, assumes the duty of organisation and strategic coordination of the Group through the
dissemination, implementation and monitoring of the overall strategy and of the basic management

guidelines established by the Board of Directors.

--- Page 8 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

c) This organisation and coordination duty is strengthened through the boards of directors of country
subholding companies, which includes independent directors, and their own audit committees,
internal audit areas, and compliance units or divisions.

d) The business subholding companies of the Group assume decentralised executive responsibilities.
They carry out the day-to-day administration and effective management of each of the businesses,
and are responsible for the day-to-day control thereof. These business subholding companies are
organised through their respective boards of directors and their own decision-making bodies.

The corporate and governance structure of the Group described above operates jointly with the Group’s
Business Model, which entails the global integration of the businesses and aims to maximise the
operational efficiency of the different units. The Business Model ensures the dissemination, implementation
and monitoring of the overall strategy and of the basic management guidelines established for each
business, primarily through the exchange of best practices among the various companies of the Group,
without detracting from their independence in decision-making.

In any case, the Company and the Group assume the commitments established by law in connection with

the legal and functional separation of the companies carrying out regulated activities, while the country
subholding companies ensure compliance with the law on this matter.

1.5. Organization of the Board, or bodies in which it delegates its decision, including control
functions and the policy followed with minority interests.

A comprehensive description of the governance structure of the Company, functions and _ internal
regulations of the committees can be seen in Appendix C of the Annual Corporate Governance Report,
which forms part of this Management Report.

1.6. Regulatory framework of the activities

A comprehensive description of sector regulation and operation of electric and gas system in the markets in
which the Group operates can be seen in Appendix II “Sector regulation and functioning of the electricity
and gas system” of these Financial Statements.

1.7. Main products and services, production processes

The main products that IBERDROLA offers to its customers are power and natural gas, both in the
wholesale and retail markets reaching the final consumer. Also offers a wide range of products, services
and solutions in the fields of:

- Improving the quality of life, calm and safety of the consumer.

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

- Global management of facilities and energy supplies.

Through its subsidiaries it also provides engineering and construction services of power generation
facilities, distribution and control; operation and maintenance of power generation facilities, management
and promotion of the ground; and sale and rental of housing, offices and commercials. More detailed
information can be found in www.iberdrola.com, in "customers" section.

As a general rule, companies directly manage the activities that belong to its core business, and outsource
other estimated to be developed more efficiently by other specialized companies, which IBERDROLA
requires certain quality standards and responsible behaviour in environmental, social and labour fields.

This information can be extended with corresponding indicators described in the Sustainability Report.
1.8. Strategic principles for the 2017-2021 period

Market conditions

The energy scenario in which IBERDROLA will develop its activity in the next few years will be based on
three pillars:

e Decarbonisation, which will have as a direct consequence greater electrification of the economy,
mainly based on energy from renewable sources;

e Technological advances, which will continue to drive the trend of increasing efficiency in renewable
sources of generation and power grids; and

e Increased consumer connectivity, leading to demand for new energy services made possible by
digitisation.

For all that, we estimate that world demand for electricity will increase by more than 60% to 2040, and that
as a proportion of final demand for energy it will grow by four percentage points from its 2016 level to reach
23%.

Underpinned by these pillars, the company will continue to strengthen its lead position in the various
markets in which it has a presence:

- In the United States the company is taking up a position to home in on opportunities for investment
in energy infrastructures and renewables through the platform operated by its subsidiary
AVANGRID, which has eight regulated energy Transport distribution companies in New York,
Connecticut, Maine and Massachusetts, and is the country's second largest wind energy producer.

- The company will continue to expand in the United Kingdom in terms of networks and consolidate
its leadership in renewable energies, especially offshore wind power plants on the current platform.

- In the Iberian peninsula it will bolster its position of leadership in energy from renewable sources
and the associated grids.

- In Mexico, it will continue to invest in contracted generation, building on its position as the leading

private sector supplier of electricity and taking advantage of the opportunities arising from the
Energy Reform and the associated liberalisation of the sector.

264 (sd weRDROLA


--- Page 10 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

- In Brazil, NEOENERGIA is already the country’s leading electric utility in terms of number of
customers, with a presence in ten states, and has great opportunities for growth in both energy
from renewable sources and transport and distribution grids.

- Elsewhere in Europe, the company has already brought its first German offshore wind farm into
operation, and is developing a project in France. In the retail business it is also extending its
activities to other European markets, mainly Portugal, France and Italy.

Outlook 2018-2022

- IBERDROLA will continue to focus its investment strategy on grids, renewables and
contracted generation, in its current areas of activity, in which it will invest EUR 32,000 million
between now and 2022.

- The grids business will account for 50% of total capital expenditure, while renewables will
account for 37% and contracted generation for 4%. Lastly, 9% of total investment will be
earmarked for the generation and retail business.

Subsequently, 90 % of the investment scheduled will target regulated business —networks, renewable
energies and long-term contracts.

By geographical areas, Iberdrola will invest 38 % in dollars, 19 % in sterling pounds, 25 % in the
Eurozone and 18 % in Brazilian reals.

Main projects

e United States: Through AVANGRID the Group will continue investing in transmission grids and
distribution infrastructure. Moreover, the company plans on reaching 8,700 installed MW of
renewable source in 2022.

e United Kingdom: IBERDROLA will continue to implement network infrastructures under the
regulatory frameworks already approved for transmission and distribution (RIIO-T1 and RIIO-ED1).
As regards the renewable energy projects in the UK, the company continues to develop the 714
MW East Anglia One offshore wind project in the North Sea, which will be fully operational in 2020.

e Mexico: IBERDROLA's investment packages will focus on regulated generation and renewable
energies, on the strength of the energy reform introduced in this country. The Company is building
three combined-cycle plants and two cogeneration plants on long-term contracts, with a combined
power output of 3,570 MW, and has plans for further investment in renewable energies in the years
ahead. These projects, together with others in advanced stages of development, will allow the
company to attain 10,600 MW of installed capacity in the country by 2022.

e Iberian Peninsula: investments will be centred on the area of distribution grids. The company will
also continue with the construction of the Rio Tamega hydroelectric storage complex in Portugal,
which will have a total capacity of 1,158 MW.

e Brazil: Through NEOENERGIA, IBERDROLA will take advantage of the investment opportunities in
the Grids and Renewables businesses.

Operational efficiency

IBERDROLA, one of Europe's most efficient major electricity companies, will continue to boost its operating
efficiency on the strength of technical progress in terms of the automation and digitalisation of all its
businesses and processes, as well as the homogenization of processes through the implementation of the
best practices of the group in all its businesses.

Earnings performance

This strategy of profitable growth in mature businesses, efficient management of assets and the investment
plan described will lead to sustainable growth in the company’s profits, which are expected to amount to
more than EUR 11,500 million between now and 2022. In terms of net profit, this is estimated to exceed
EUR 3,500 million a year by the end of the plan.

Shareholder remuneration

The trend forecast for the period will enable the company to increase long-term remuneration for
shareholders, in keeping with results,

Financial solvency

The Company will continue to hold a solid financial position compatible with the investment plans and the
remuneration provided to shareholders.

e Funds from operations (FFO) will reach EUR 42,000 million on a cumulative basis, with cash
generation exceeding capital expenditure in all business areas.

e At the end of the period the company will have EUR 9,000 million of capital expenditure in
progress, corresponding to assets that will start producing results beyond 2022. This allows the
bases for further growth beyond the plan horizon to be established.

«Allin all we expect the Group’s ratio of FFO to Net Debt to be at around 24% in 2022.

2. BUSINESS EVOLUTION AND RESULTS
2.1 Operating highlights for the period

Iberdrola’s results for the period must be framed within the implementation of the corporate strategy
announced on Investor Day 2017, defined by the growing weight of regulated activities (transmission and
distribution of electricity and gas) and the renewables business, both in terms of utilising investment
opportunities and contributing to the Group’s profit, with a growing weight of the United States and Mexico
businesses on said contribution.

The following highlights should be noted regarding the period analysed, in comparison to the previous
financial year, for their relevance in the interpretation of the profit for the year:

- On 24 August, having obtained approval from the ANEEL (Agéncia Nacional de Energia Elétrica or
National Electrical Energy Agency) the BNDES (Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econémico e
Social or National Bank for Economic and Social Development) and the CADE (Conselho
Administrativo de Defesa Econémica or Administrative Council for Economic Defence) we completed
the transaction whereby the businesses of Elektro were incorporated into Neoenergia, thus creating a
leading utility in Brazil and Latin America focused on the Grids and Renewables businesses. Following
the transaction, IBERDROLA holds 52.45% of the resulting company, which has 13.6 million supply
points, 585,000 km of distribution grid and more than 3,500 MW of contracted capacity in operation
and under construction mainly in renewables. The transaction was carried out without affecting the
Group's financial solidity, with no cash component, no capital increase and strengthening our position
in an already well-known company.

- The results for 2017 were achieved in extremely difficult operating circumstances, with Spain suffering
one of the driest years on record and 11 TWh less hydro-electricity being produced than in 2016. This
difficult situation was partly offset by the good performance of the Grids business in the United States
and the Generation and Retail business in Mexico, with the coming on stream of new capacity in
accordance with the 2016-2020 Growth Plan.

- The tax reform approved in the US in the final weeks of the financial year, which reduces federal
income tax from 35% to 21%, led to an improvement of EUR 1,284 million in net income. The impact is

as follows:

o Asa result of the reduction of the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, net income increased by
EUR 2,026 million (see Notes 2.c and 30).

o Impact on the value in use of the renewables business in the US, which required an impairment
adjustment to goodwill in an amount of EUR 450 million (see Note 13).

267 (sd weRDROLA


--- Page 13 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

o Impact on non-controlling interests of the two foregoing effects: EUR 292 million.
- Non-current asset profit/(loss):

o the merger of the wind energy businesses of Gamesa Corporacién Tecnoldgica, S.A. (as the
company absorbed) and Siemens AG GAMESA (as absorbing company), leading to a dilution of
the percentage holding of the IBERDROLA Group, which went from 19.69% to 8.07% in the
new Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. group. This transaction contributed EUR 251
million to profit for the year, of which EUR 198 million correspond to the extraordinary merger
dividend paid to former shareholders of GAMESA.

o the corporate reorganisation in Brazil, involving a capital gain of EUR 44 million on revaluing
39% of Neoenergia, S.A.

- We have discontinued the Engineering activity which is reported under discontinued operations in the
consolidated financial statements, restating the figures for the previous year as required by the
accounting rules.

As for average movements in IBERDROLA’s main reference currencies against the euro during 2017,
sterling depreciated by 7.1% and the US dollar by 1.9%, these movements being partly offset by the 6.7%
appreciation of the Brazilian real.

For the system as a whole, the following points stand out:

- In Spain, the period was characterised by a sharp fall in hydroelectric production (48.9%), and a
decline in nuclear production (0.9%). Production with other renewable technologies, coal-fired and
gas-fired power stations covered the fall in hydroelectric and nuclear, with increases of 1.8%, 21% and

38% respectively. Electricity demand was slightly higher compared with 2016 (1%).

- In the United Kingdom, electricity demand dropped by 1.7% compared to 2016. Customer's gas
demand (not including generation consumption) also drops 3.1% due to a more benign weather.

- Inthe AVANGRID area in the East Coast of the USA, electricity demand dropped by 2%, while gas
demand stayed practically the same, increasing 0.5% compared to 2016.

- On the other hand, in the Iberdrola area in Brazil, electricity demand rose by 1.2% compared to 2016.

2.2 Magnitudes basicas gestionadas

At the end of 2017, IBERDROLA had 46,075 MW installed generation capacity, of which 65.6% produces
emission-free energy while operating at a very low variable cost. In the table below distribution classified by
countries and technologies is shown:

Power per country (MW) 2017 2016 MW change
Spain 25,607 25,605 2

2.3.1

-1 Gross Margin

Gross Margin was at EUR 13,364 million with a 3.3% increase compared to that obtained in financial year
2016, supported by the contribution of US, Mexico and Brazil, due to the incorporation of NEOENERGIA.

The

performance of reference currencies had a negative effect of EUR 186 million compensated by a

better performance of the businesses of EUR 614 million including the incorporation of NEONERGIA.

The gross margin by business is as follows:

Millions of euros 2017 2016 % charge
Network Business 6,787 6,161 10.2
Deregulated Business 4,238 4,634 (8.5)

Other businesses 53 5 960.0
Corporation and adjustments (40) (44) 9.1
Gross Margin 13,364 12,935 3.3

Network Business

The

Networks business improved its contribution by 10.2% to reach EUR 6,787 million (EUR 6,161 million

in 2016) supported by the improvement in the United States and the corporate reorganisation in Brazil.

Millions of euros 2017 2016 % charge
Spain 2,003 2,028 (1.2)
United Kingdom 1,174 1,267 (7.3)
United States 2,754 2,537 8.6
Brazil 856 329 160.2
Total 6,787 6,161 10.2

As notable events in the evolution of the gross margin during the period we can highlight the following:

Gross margin in Spain reached EUR 2,003 million, EUR 25 million lower than the previous year,
mainly explained by a decrease in recognised income of EUR 27 million. This is due to the fact that in
2016, positive re-estimates from previous years were recognised for EUR 16 million that affected the
comparison.

The United Kingdom contributed EUR 1,174 million (-7.3%), mainly due to the devaluation of the
pound. This business is also affected by lower demand in 2017 due to the climate and reassessments
of previous years due to lower-than-anticipated investments.

The contribution of the United States in the period stands at EUR 2,754 million, EUR 217 million
higher than the previous year (8.6%), despite the devaluation of the dollar which had an effect of EUR
53 million and an improvement of EUR 270 million for the business from the new rate cases and lower
energy costs.

The Gross Margin of Brazil amounts to EUR 856 million (160.2%) affected by the appreciation of the

Real, EUR 58 million, the corporate reorganisation, which accounts for EUR 421 million, and the
increase in the energy distributed and the annual rate reviews.

Deregulated Business

The Deregulated Business (Generation and Retail) decreased by 8.5% to EUR 4,238 million (EUR 4,634
million in 2016).

Brazil 89 6 1,383.3
United States 17 48 (64.6)
Total 4,238 4,634 (8.5)

In Spain, the Gross Margin reached EUR 2,690 million (-12.4%), mainly due to the low hydropower
contribution during the year offset by the positive evolution of the results in the gas business after the
contract price review.

Gross Margin for the United Kingdom was EUR 796 million. 204 lower in comparison to 2016. This
variation negatively affected by the depreciation of the Sterling Pound in (the local currency
depreaciated 14.7%). Production was 25.5% lower than in 2016 (-2,665 GWh), affected by the closure
of the Longannet plant, which, together with higher supply costs, the increase in the cost of green
certificates (ROCs), lower sales of gas and the narrowing of commercial margins explain this reduction
in the contribution of the business.

- Mexico’s contribution to Gross Margin amounts to EUR 646 million (26.9%), improving in EUR 137

million the 2016 contribution. Depreciation of the US dollar results in a decrease of EUR12 million.
The increase of EUR 149 million by the business has its origin in the PPA contracts (EUR 60
million), which include the commissioning of the Baja California combined cycle; improvement in
sales to private customers and increase in power (EUR 81 million); other smaller items, surpluses,
etc. (EUR 8 million).

The Gross Margin of Brazil came to EUR 89 million, the main effects of the increase of EUR 82 million
were: the appreciation of the Real, which accounted for EUR 6 million and the corporate
reorganisation, which accounted for EUR 76 million.

Renewable Business

The

Renewable business decreased its Gross Margin by 6.7% to EUR 2,326 million (EUR 2,179 million in

2016), EUR 147 million more in comparison to 2016.

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

The main causes of this trend are:

In Spain, it increased to EUR 13 million up to EUR 777 million (+1.7%) despite lower production.

The gross margin in the United Kingdom increased by EUR 108 million to EUR 493 million (28.1%)
despite the impact of the devaluation of the pound, which accounted for EUR 35 million. Despite this,
the higher production (+42%) derived from better onshore and offshore wind power during the year
and the increase in onshore power improved the gross margin by EUR 115 million. The improvement
of the ROC price and other minor effects explain the remaining EUR 28 million.

The contribution of the United States for the period totalled EUR 783 million (-2.4%), EUR 19 million
less compared to the previous year. The effect of the devaluation of the dollar had a negative impact
of EUR 15 million, while the improvement in production improved the gross margin by EUR 7 million
and was offset by the reduction in the year of EUR 11 million in the impact of electricity and gas
derivatives.

Mexico contributed EUR 2 million to the Gross Margin due to increase in prices.

Brazil contributed EUR 42 million in higher margin, affected by the appreciation of the Brazilian real
and greater volume (+87.5%) due to the global integration of the plants of the Neoenergia subgroup.

The rest of the world increased slightly with respect to 2016, EUR 1 million, due to an increase in

production of 0.8%.

Other businesses

The contribution of Other Businesses reached EUR 53 million, a decrease of 960.0% (EUR 5 million in

2016), although it is due to the discontinuation of the engineering business.

2.3.1.2 Gross Operating result - EBITDA

Consolidated EBITDA decreased by EUR 615 million, -7.8%, to EUR 7,319 million (EUR 7,934 million in
2016), where the Networks (+3.6%) and Renewables (6.1%) businesses improved and the Liberalised
Generation and Customers business reduced its contribution (-28.9%). This reduction in EBITDA without
considering the exchange rate effect of EUR 105 million would be EUR 510 million (-6.4%).

However, without taking into account the early retirement plan for each year, EBITDA would decrease by
EUR 452 million (-5.7%) and would be 4% lower if the variation in the main currencies was not considered.

The net operating expense increased by EUR 704 million (20.3%) to EUR 4,170 million (EUR 3,466 million
in 2016) affected by the exchange rate, EUR 54 million, the reorganisation in Brazil that accounted for EUR
254 million, the effect of the storms in the United States came to EUR 109 million and the variation in the
early retirement plan for an amount of EUR 163 million. The growth in the business itself and positive
impacts in 2016 that affect the comparison explain the remaining EUR 124 million.

Taxes

Taxes increased by EUR 339 million, 22.1% higher than those registered in 2016, to reach EUR 1,875

million, due to:

- the positive exchange rate effect (EUR 28 million) and the decrease of EUR 43 million in the taxes

from the Sustainability Act, hydropower fee;

- several positive impacts recorded in 2016 that amounted to EUR 269 million and had a negative
impact on the year-on-year comparison (the territorial supplement, the Ecotax and the discount rate
(bono social) amounted to EUR 119 million, EUR 8 million and EUR 142 million respectively);

- the negative impacts of spending on the discount rate (bono social) in 2017 for EUR 68 million and the
increase in rates in the United Kingdom, mainly in the Generation and Customers business derived
from the Warm Home Discount programme and the United States for EUR 30 million and EUR 6

million, respectively;

- provisions and other minor effects accounted for an increase of EUR 37 million.

- The Amortisations item rose EUR 99 million (3.2%), and reached EUR 3.186 million.

co The effects that reduce this item with respect to the previous year are: the exchange rate effect,
EUR 49 million and the modification of the useful life of the combined cycles of 35 to 40 years and
the electromechanical equipment of the hydraulic power plants from 35 to 50 years (limited by the
date of concession of each plant) that had a positive impact of EUR 65 million; the net impact of
other minor effects is EUR 3 million;

o The incorporation of the corporate reorganisation in Brazil and the new investments increased the
amortisations by EUR 117 million and EUR 99 million, respectively;

- Provisions represent EUR 1,420 million. The main impacts registered are:

o Provision derived from the classification as maintained for the disposal of the gas business in the
United States and Canada in the amount of EUR 744 million (Notes 34 and 41);

o Reorganisation of the goodwill of the renewables business in the United States as a result of the
tax reform amounting to EUR 450 million;

o The remaining EUR 226 million are net of several less significant provisions and reversals.

2.3.1.4. Financial Result

The net financial result was EUR -937 million, rising EUR 34 million, improving by 3.8% compared to that
registered in 2016 (EUR -903 million), mainly due to the consolidation of NEOENERGIA.

The reduction in the average cost to 3.49% (57 b.p. lower than last year) has contributed with a EUR 64.8
million (6%) on the improvement of the result associated to debt, despite the fact that average net debt
increased by EUR 3,470 million.

The result of the valuation of the foreign currency and derivatives items was greatly reduced by the
valuation of the hedges on net profit in foreign currency (extraordinarily high for the pound in 2016). On the
other hand, several non-recurrent contingencies (mainly default interest recognised in court rulings)
resulted in higher financial income. The net impact of both effects was EUR 13 million.

The contribution to the financial result of the integration of Neoenergia as from 24th August had an impact
of EUR 86 million.

2.3.1.5 Results of Companies Consolidated by the Equity Method

The item of Company Results using the Participation Method accounted for EUR -29 million compared to
2016, coming to EUR 47 million as a result of Neoenergia becoming consolidated globally instead of using
the equity method since 24th August and the lower contribution by Gamesa-Siemens.

2.3.1.6 Income from Non-Current Assets

Income from Non-Current Assets amounted to EUR 279 million with a decrease of EUR 469.4% million
compared to 2016 (EUR 49 million). In 2017 the most significant transactions were as follows:

274 sd weRDROLA


--- Page 20 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

- The absorption of Gamesa and Siemens that contributed EUR 251 million (EUR 198 million)
corresponded to the cash received as an extraordinary merger dividend;

- The corporate reorganisation carried out in Brazil led to the takeover of Neoenergia, going from a
stake of 39% to 52%, after having contributed Elektro to Neoenergia. Upon taking control, the initial

shareholding of 39% was recorded at market value, recording a capital gain of EUR 44 million.

- The sale of Amara and other assets resulted in net losses of EUR 14 million.

2.3.1.7 Net Profit

The Net Profit amounts to EUR 2,804 million, with an increase of 3.7% compared to that obtained in 2016
(EUR 2,705 million) thanks to the impact of the tax reform in the United States, a positive figure of EUR
2,026 million in the tax item, which meant that this item went from expenditure of EUR 935 million in 2016
to a positive result of EUR 1,397 million in 2017.

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

The Energy Balance of the peninsular system in 2017 is characterised by a significant increase in thermal
production compared to the previous year (26%), mainly due to the reduction of hydroelectric production
(47%) as it was a year with very low rainfall. The rest of the production from renewable sources increased
by 2%, mainly due to the higher wind production recorded in the last quarter (+44% compared to the same
period of the previous year). Coal and combined cycles production have increased in 21 and 32%
respectively in comparison to 2016. In terms of demand, it increased by 1% with respect to the same period
of 2016, while in terms adjusted for work and temperature, it grew by 1.6%.

According to IBERDROLA, during the twelve months of 2017, production decreased by 22.1% until
reaching 39,368 GWh.

The evolution of the year by technologies is as follows:

- Hydraulic production reached 7,467 GWh, a decrease of 59.7% over the previous year. The level
of hydropower reserves as of 31st December 2017 was at 29% compared to 42% as of 31st
December 2016 (equivalent to 3,314 GWH compared to 4,791 GWh), all due to the exceptionally
low rainfall in the year.

- Nuclear production stands at 23,190 GWh, registering a decrease of 4.7%, as a consequence of
the lengthening of the stoppage at the Cofrentes plant.

-  Coal-fired power stations reached 2,665 GWh, compared to 2,115 GWh the previous year,
representing an increase of 26.0%.

- Production of combined cycle plants, for their part, increased by 4.3%, until reaching 3,883 GWh.
- Cogeneration plants increase their production by 15.4%, until reaching 2,163 GWh.
A.2_ Retailing

Supplied energy (electricity and gas) in Spain came to 55,157 GWh (51,614 GWh in 2016) and 7,926 GWh

Kingdom, located in the Irish Sea, with an installed capacity of 194 MW and Wikinger in Germany with 350
Mw.

Currently, the renewables business is developing offshore wind projects mainly in the United Kingdom,
Germany and France.

In Germany, active work is being carried out to increase the portfolio of projects in the German Baltic Sea,
in the vicinity of the Wikinger wind farm, through the participation in the auctions that will be organised by
the German regulator in April 2018.

In France, in April 2012, the consortium formed by IBERDROLA and the French company EOLE-RES was
awarded by the French Government the exclusive rights for the operation of the offshore wind farm of
Saint-Brieuc, with a capacity of 500 MW. In October 2015, the project submitted its application for a
construction license, which was granted in April 2017. This gives way to the pre-FID phase, with the
geotechnical studies campaign currently under way as the first milestone in the construction.

Iberdrola is developing in the United Kingdom the “East Anglia” project in the North Sea. The East Anglia 1
project (714 MW) is in the construction phase, with on-site work and ongoing manufacturing activities
initiated in various locations inside and outside Europe. Progress is being made on the wiring and land
substation works, which will connect the project with the national network.

The manufacturing works are taking place in various locations inside and outside Europe: Navantia is
manufacturing the offshore substation and 42 jackets on which the turbines will be installed. The
completion of the first jacket is expected in October 2018. Lamprell has started manufacturing the
remaining 60 jackets, 24 of which will be assembled at Harland & Wolff, in Belfast. Nexans is finalising the
detail design and will begin to produce the “sub-sea’” wiring, and Prysmian has already produced more than
50% of the onshore wiring.

The project is moving forward in order to commence the marine works in 2018, starting with the foundation
works by van Oord, and continuing with the installation of the marine substation by Seaway Heavy Lifting,
and the installation of the marine wiring, for its connection with the terrestrial substation, by Nexans and
DeepOcean. Siemens Gamesa will manufacture and install the 102 units of 7MW turbines, installation of
which is expected to begin in mid-2019.

f)

Corporate Governance Risks: the Company assumes the need to safeguard the interests of the
Company and the strategy of sustained maximisation of the economic value of the Company and
its long-term success, in accordance with the Group’s corporate interest, culture, and corporate
vision, taking into account the legitimate public and private interests that converge in the conduct of
all business activities, particularly those of the various stakeholders and communities and regions
in which the Company and its employees act. A fundamental requirement for the foregoing is
compliance with the Company's Corporate Governance System, made up of the By-Laws, the
Corporate Policies, the internal corporate governance rules, and the other internal codes and
procedures approved by the competent decision-making bodies of the Company and inspired by
the good governance recommendations generally recognised in international markets.

Market risks: defined as the exposure of the Group’s results and equity to changes in market prices
and variables, such as exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices (electricity, gas, CO2
emission rights, other fuel, etc.), prices of financial assets and others.

Credit Risks: defined as the possibility that a counterparty fails to perform its contractual
obligations, thus causing an economic or financial loss to the Group. Counterparties can be final
customers, counterparties in financial or energy markets, partners, suppliers, or contractors.

Business Risks: defined as the uncertainty regarding the performance of key variables inherent to
the business, such as the characteristics of demand, weather conditions, the strategies of different
players, and others.

Political and Regulatory Risks: defined as those arising from regulatory changes made by the
various regulators, such as changes in compensation of regulated activities or in the required
conditions of supply, or environmental o tax regulations, including risks related to political changes
that could affect the legal security and to the legal framework applicable to the Group’s businesses
in each jurisdiction, the nationalization or expropriation of assets, the operating licenses
cancelation and the previous end of the contracts of the administration.

Operational Risks: defined as those related to direct or indirect economic losses resulting from
inadequate internal procedures, technical failures, human error, or as a consequence of certain
external events, including the economic, social, environmental, and reputational impact, as well as
legal and fraud risks.

Reputational Risks: potential negative impact on the value of the Company resulting from the
conduct of the Company that is below the expectations created among various stakeholders:
shareholders, customers, media, analysts, Government, employees, and society in general.

Owing to its universal and dynamic nature, the system allows for the consideration of new risks that may
affect the Group as a consequence of changes in its operating environment or revisions of objectives and
strategies, as well as adjustments resulting from ongoing monitoring, verification, review and supervision
activities.

The Audit and Risk Supervision Committee of the Board of Directors periodically monitors the evolution of
the Company's risks:

It reviews the Group’s risk quarterly reports, which include monitoring compliance with risk limits
and indicators and updated key risk maps, submitted by the Group’s director of corporate risks.

- It coordinates and reviews risk reports sent periodically, at least semi-annually, by the audit and
compliance committees of the main subsidiaries of the Group, being included the subholding
companies of the main countries where the Group operates that, along with the risk director
appearances are used to prepare a risk report for the Board of Directors at least semi-annually.

For further details, see the section E of Control systems and risk management of the Corporate
Governance Report 2017.

4.2. Credit risk

The IBERDROLA Group is exposed to the credit risk arising from the possibility that counterparties
(customers, suppliers, financial institutions, partners, etc.) might fail to comply with contractual obligations.
This exposure may arise with regard to unsettled amounts, to the cost of replacing products that are not
supplied, as well as, in the case of dedicated plants, to amounts on which depreciation is pending, of said
plants.

Credit risk is managed and limited in accordance with the type of transaction and the credit worthiness of
the counterparty. A specific corporate credit risk policy is in place which establishes criteria for admission,
approval systems, authorisation levels, scoring tools, exposure measurement methodologies, etc.

With regard to credit risk on trade receivables, the historical cost of defaults has remained moderate and
stable at close to 1% of total turnover of this activity, despite the current difficult economic environment.
Regarding other exposure (counterparties in transactions with derivatives, placement of cash surpluses,
sale transactions involving energy and guarantees received from third parties), in 2017 and 2016 there
have been no material non-payments or losses.

The Group’s Networks businesses in Spain and the UK do not sell energy. Therefore their credit risk is
limited. In the case of Brazil and the United States, the activity of supplying to regulated tariff allows to
recover, in general terms, commercial default.

4.3. Financial risk
4.3.1. Interest rate risk

The IBERDROLA Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates affecting cash flows and
market value in respect of items in the balance sheet (debt and derivatives). In order to adequately manage
and limit this risk, the IBERDROLA Group manages annually the proportion of fixed and variable debt and
establishes the actions to be carried out throughout the year: new sources of financing (at a fixed, floating
or indexed rate) and/or the use of interest rate derivatives.

The reference interest rates for the floating rate borrowings are basically Euribor, Libor- sterling pound,
Libor-dollar and the CDI in the case of the debt of the Brazilian subsidiaries .

Additionally, as of 31 December 2017, the IBERDROLA Group has arranged derivatives to cover the
interest rate risk of the future financing for a nominal amount of EUR 3,620,000 thousand euros, which

help to mitigate the interest rate risk.

The debt structure at 31 December 2017, once considered the hedge provided by the derivatives traded, is
included in the Note 5 of the Consolidated financial statements.

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

4.3.2. Foreign currency risk

As the IBERDROLA Group's presentation currency is the euro, fluctuations in the value of the currencies in
which borrowings are instrumented and transactions are carried out with respect to the euro, mainly the
Sterling Pound, the US Dollar and the Brazilian Real, may have an effect on the finance costs, profit and
equity of the Group.

The following items could be affected by exchange rate risk:

- Proceeds and payments for supplies, services or equipment acquisition in currencies other than
the local or functional currencies.

- Income and expenses incurred by certain foreign subsidiaries indexed to currencies other than the
local or functional currencies.

- Debt and financial expense denominated in currencies other than the local or functional currency.
- Profit or loss in consolidation of the foreign subsidiaries.
- Consolidated carrying amount of investments in foreign subsidiaries.

- Expense for taxes in Mexico because the functional currency (United States dollar) differs from the
currency for calculation purposes of corporate taxes (Mexican peso).

The IBERDROLA Group reduces this risk by:

- Ensuring that all its economic flows are carried out in the currency of each Group company,
provided that this is possible and economically viable and efficient, through the use of derivatives if
not.

- As far as possible, this covers the risk of transfer of earnings scheduled for the current year,
thereby limiting the ultimate impact on Group earnings.

- As far as possible, this covers the expense of the exchange rate risk in the Mexican corporate
taxes, limiting the overall impact on the earnings of Mexico and of the Group.

- Mitigating the impact on the consolidated net asset value of a hypothetical depreciation of
currencies due to Group’s investment in foreign subsidiaries by maintaining foreign currency debt,
as well as through financial derivatives.

The sensitivity of the consolidated profit and equity of the IBERDROLA Group to changes in the dollar/euro,
sterling pound /euro and Brazilian real/euro exchange rate is as referred to in Note 5 of the Consolidate
financial statement. The detailed information interest rate and currency can be seen in Note 26 of the
Consolidated financial statement.

4.3.3. Liquidity risk

Exposure to adverse situations in the debt or capital markets or in relation to the IBERDROLA Group's own
economic-financial situation may hinder or prevent the IBERDROLA Group from obtaining the financing
required to properly carry on its business activities.

291 ("ld wERDROLA

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

IBERDROLA Group's liquidity policy is designed to ensure that it can meet its payment obligations without
having to obtain financing under unfavourable terms. For this purpose, various management measures are
used such as the arrangement of committed credit facilities of sufficient amount, deadline and flexibility,
diversification of the coverage of financing needs through access to different markets and geographical
areas, and diversification of the maturities of the debt issued.

The balances for cash, liquid assets and available committed credit facilities are sufficient for meeting the
Group's liquidity (not including NEONERGIA) needs for more than 18 months, not including the new
inancing facilities.

The figures relating to changes in the Company's debt are included in Notes 26 and 52 to the Consolidated
inancial statements.

4.4. Country risk

The activities of the different businesses that the IBERDROLA Group developed are submitted, in greater
or lesser extent depending on their characteristics, to various risks inherent to the country where they
operate:

- Imposition of monetary and other restrictions on the movement of capital.

- Changes in the trade environment and administrative policies.

- Economic crisis, political instability and social riots affecting operations.

-  Nationalisation or expropriation of assets.

- Exchange rate fluctuations.

-  Cancelation of operating licenses.

- Anticipated termination of Government contracts.

- Regulatory changes.

The results of our international subsidiaries, their market value and their contribution to the Group may be
affected by such risks.

The IBERDROLA Group's main operations are focused on Spain, United Kingdom, USA, Brazil and
Mexico, countries with low or moderate risk, whose credit ratings at 31 December 2017 are as follows:

Country Moody's S&P Fitch
Spain Baa2 BBB+ BBB+
United Kingdom Aa2 AA AA
United States Aaa AA+ AAA
Brazil Ba2 BB BB
Mexico A3 BBB+ BBB+

The presence in countries other than the ones mentioned above is not significant at Group level from an
economic point of view.

4.5. Activity risks

The activities of the various businesses developed by the IBERDROLA Group are subject to various risks
including market, credit, operational, business, regulatory and reputational risks arising from the uncertainty
of the main variables that affect them.

It must be noted that on 24 August 2017, after the integration of Elektro (formerly 100% owned by
IBERDROLA) in Neonergia, the Group passed to control 52.45% of said group, globally consolidating said
activity. Neoenergia operates in the sectors of electricity generation, transmission, and distribution in
Brazil.

The analysis by businesses made in this section consider the management model in force at the end of
2017, where the hydraulic capacity in Spain is managed and operated by Generation and Customers
business, given that the transfer notice of said activity to the Renewable business is pending development,
and is forecast to be carried out in 2018.

The gas business in the United States and Canada is considered a non-strategic asset by Avangrid, in its
publication of its 2016 annual results on 21 February 2017.

4.5.1.Regulatory and political risks

Companies in the IBERDROLA Group are subject to laws and regulations concerning prices and other
aspects of their activities in each of the countries in which they operate. The introduction of new laws and
regulations or amendments to the already existing ones may have an adverse effect on the Group’s
operations annual results and economic value of businesses.

The following paragraphs are a few of the new major regulatory measures that were approved in 2017 or
are due to be implemented in 2018:

Spain:

On 23 December, the Royal Decree-law 7/2016 and Royal Decree 897/2017 and Order
ETU/943/2017 which regulate the mechanism for financing the cost of Social tariff and other
measures to protect vulnerable electricity consumers (“social tariff!) and other protections
measures for home electricity consumers implemented by retail companies.

United States:

Approval of rate cases by the regulator of the Estate of New York RG&E and NYSEG, valid from
July 2016 for a period of three years, in satisfactory terms for the Company.

Brazil:
Approval by the Brazilian regulator ANEEL of the new terms for the new regulatory period of Celpe,
valid for a period of four years, in satisfactory terms for the Company. Annual rates for Coelba,
Cosern and Elektro were revised. Lastly, ANEEL's publication of Technical Note No. 179/2017-
SRM must be noted, which establishes greater requirements in terms of corporate governance for
electricity distribution companies.

Mexico:

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

- Approval of the Energy Regulatory Commission's Agreement A/058/2017 which defines the
methodology to determine the final tariffs calculations and adjustment, along with operations tariffs
that will apply to the subsidiary production company "CFE Suministrador de Servicios Basicos”
from 1 December 2017 to 31 December 2018. Once this new methodology to calculate the
electricity tariff, which was announced in 2016, was published, regulatory uncertainty lessened.

4. 5. 2. Network business risk

The regulations of each country in which the IBERDROLA Group's network businesses operate establish
regularly revised frameworks, guaranteeing that these businesses will receive reasonable and predictable
returns. These frameworks include penalties and bonuses for efficiency, service quality and, eventually, for
default management, which have a minor, immaterial impact overall. Any change to the aforementioned
regulation may represent a risk for said business.

In general, the profitability of the IBERDROLA Group's network businesses is not exposed to demand risk,
except for the Brazilian subsidiaries.

The IBERDROLA Group's network businesses in Spain and in the United Kingdom are not exposed to any
market risk associated with energy prices.

The network businesses in Brazil and some of the businesses in the USA sell energy to regulated
customers at a price determined by certain previously approved tariffs. In the case of a prudent
procurement management and as established by the regulator, the regulatory frameworks in both countries
guarantee sums will be collected in subsequent tariff readjustment reviews for possible purchase price
deviations from those previously recognised in the tariff.

Given the above, in the case of extraordinary events (extreme drought in Brazil as happened in 2014,
catastrophic storms in USA, etc.), occasional temporary gaps between payments and collections may arise
with an impact on the cash flows of some of these businesses and eventually on profits recognised under
IFRS.

Spanish networks:

The present regulatory model is based on Electricity Sector Law 24/2013 of 26 December, establishing
regulatory six-year periods and profitability for distribution activity calculated as the yield on government
bonds plus 200 basis points. Profitability was set at 6.5% for the first regulatory period, which was extended
until the end of 2019. Fluctuation of the financial remuneration rate used between two consecutive years
may not exceed 50 basic points in absolute value.

Royal Decree 1048/2013 of 27 December establishing the methodology to calculate remuneration for
electricity distribution activities defines a methodology based on standard unit costs of investment and
operation. The remuneration of facilities will be calculated on the basis of the real audited cost and the
standard cost recognised for each investment, and therefore profitability will depend on the constructive
efficiency achieved.

Moreover, in accordance with current regulations, the distribution company does not sell any energy to
customers, and it is therefore not exposed to market risk at the present time. This means that fluctuations

in demand have no direct impact on the income statement.

United Kingdom Networks:

204 19d wERDROLA


--- Page 40 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

The group operates in the United Kingdom through its subsidiary Scottish Power Ltd and the following
licences:

- SP Distribution PLC (SPD)
- SP Manweb PLC (SPM)
- SP Transmission PLC (SPT)

The current regulatory model for SPD and SPM is based on the RIIO ED1 framework, and on the RIIO T1
framework in the case of SPT. The latest tariff review for electricity distributors (RIIO ED1), including SPD
and SPM, is valid from April 2015 to April 2023. The SPT review (RIIO T1) is valid from April 2013 to April
2021.

The weighted average cost of capital or WACC is set for each tariff period. The current real WACC after tax
recognised for distribution activities was 3.67% from January to March, and 3.59% from April to December,
whereas for transmision activities it was 4.46% from January to March and 4.37% from April to December.

The regulator (OFGEM) also establishes incentives/penalties for safety, environmental impact, consumer
satisfaction, social obligations, connections and quality, which may have an effect on the income
statement.

United States Networks:

The Iberdrola Group operates in the US through its listed subsidiary Avangrid, which in turn has the
following subsidiary network companies:

- New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG), New York, with a 3-year rate case valid until 2019 (base
ROE 9% for distribution).

- Rochester Gas and Electric (RG&E), New York, with a 3-year rate case valid until 2019 (base ROE
9% for distribution).

- Central Maine Power (CMP), Maine, conducting electricity distribution business with an annual
extendable rate case (base ROE 9.45% for distribution), and transmission business (base ROE
10.57%).

- United Illuminating (Ul), Connecticut, with rates in force for conducting electricity distribution
business (base ROE 9.1%) and for transmission business (base ROE 10.57%).

- It also has the following natural gas distribution companies: Maine Natural Gas Corporation (MNG),
Connecticut Natural Gas (CNG), Southern Connecticut Gas (SCG) and Berkshire Gas (BG).

Companies carrying on regulated business in the US are exposed to risks associated with the regulations
of a number of federal regulatory bodies (FERC, CFTC, DEC) and state commissions, responsible for
establishing the regulatory frameworks of the companies regulated (tariffs and other conditions).

The distributors’ tariff plans have been designed to reduce the risk to which business is exposed through
mechanisms for deferral, reconciliation and provisions for costs. Regulated distributors pass on the costs of

gas and electricity to end customers, thereby mitigating any impacts of fluctuations in demand.

Brazilian Networks:

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

The IBERDROLA Group operates in Brazil through its listed subsidiary NEOENERGIA, which in turn has
the following subsidiary network companies:

— Elektro Redes, S.A. (in the states of Sao Paoloand Mato Grosso do Sul), current rates until August
2019 and WACC of 8.09%;

— Companhia de Eletricidade do Estado do Bahia (“Coelba”), operating in the state of Bahia. rates in
force until April 2018 and WACC of 7.5%;

— Celpe Energetica de Pernambuco S.A. (“Celpe”), operating in the state of Pernambuco. rates in
force until April 2021 and WACC of 8.09%;

— Companhia Energética do Rio Grande do Norte (“Cosern”), operating in the state of Rio Grande do
Norte. Rates in force until April 2018 and WACC of 7.5%;.

— Several transmission assets with their own regulation.

The Brazilian regulatory framework is based on a system of price cap that is revised every four or five
years, depending on each company’s concession contract and is updated annually by the regulator.
COELBA and COSERN have a five-year term and CELPE and ELEKTRO have a four-year term.

Brazilian legislation applicable to regulated electricity distribution business establishes two types of costs: i)
“Plot A”, which includes the costs of energy, transport and other obligations and regulatory charges, which
can be recovered through tariffs (“pass through”) as part of the conditions and limits imposed by ANEEL,
except for other obligations and regulatory charges which can always be recovered through tariffs, and ii)
“Plot B”, which includes remuneration for investment and the costs of operation and maintenance, which
generate either an incentive or a risk for the investor.

ANEEL also acknowledges other smaller incentives to minimise default and impairment of quality and
customer satisfaction that can affect the income statement.

Pursuant to current legislation, electricity distribution companies:

a) transfer the cost of supplying electricity to the end customer through the regulated tariff, provided
the energy contracted is between 100% and 105% of the demand required.

b) risk penalties imposed by the regulator ANEEL, when this is less than 100% due to the exclusive
responsibility of the distributor.

c) risk price fluctuations when it is above 105%.
4.5.3. Renewable business

The regulations of each country in which the Group operates establish regulatory frameworks aimed at
promoting the development of renewable energies based on formulas which may include premiums, green
certificates, tax or regulated tariff deductions, which allow investors to obtain sufficient and reasonable
return. Any change to the aforementioned regulation may represent a risk for said business.

In addition to the aforementioned regulatory risk, Group’s renewable energy businesses may be subject to
a greater or lesser extent, to wind resource risk and market risk.

The Group considers that the wind resource risk is mitigated through the high number of wind power farms

available and their geographic diversification, and the trend to compensate less wind energy periods with
those with high wind energy on the medium term.

296 (sd BERDROLA

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

Regarding the electricity price risk the following should be mentioned:

Renewables business — Spain

The Group currently has a renewable installed capacity in Spain of: 5,752 MW wind farms, 303 MW
mini hydro, and 50 MW solar thermal.

Subsequent to the approval of the new regulatory framework (the Royal Decree-law 9/2013, of 12
July, Law 24/2013, of 26 December, the Royal Decree 413/2014, of 6 June, and the Ministerial Order
IET/1045/2014, of 16 June and the Ministerial Orden ETU/130/2017, of 17 February), all renewable
energy generated since 2014 is remunerated at market price plus a premium per MW. This
guarantees a reasonable regulated return based on a recognised standard investment.

— The reasonable rate of return of the investments is defined on the basis of the average yield on 10
year government bonds plus 300 basic points (that is, 7.4% for the first six-year period ending on
31 December 2019).

— This return is readjusted every three years within predetermined bands to cover any possible
deviation in market price.

— The facilities that began operating in 2003 or before have a null premium, and therefore are fully
exposed to market risks.

For the purposes of mitigating risk, the Renewables business in Spain annually sells the production
exposed to market risk to the Spanish division of the Generation and Customers business at a market
price that is reviewed each year. In this manner, the year-on-year volatility of the loss and profit
account due to the markets is practically eliminated.

Renewables business — United Kingdom

The Group's current renewables installed capacity in the UK is: 1,906 MW in onshore wind plants and
194 MW in offshore wind plants, operational under current “Renewables Obligation” legislation. This
means that income is partially exposed to the risk of the market price for electricity in the UK, as the
revenues obtained comprise income from the price of the energy produced and the sale of renewables
obligation certificates (ROC certificates).

UK regulations impose minimum ROC obligations per MWh sold on sellers of electricity, 10% more
than the system envisages producing, and determine the price at which the rest must buy, which in
practice amounts to a floor price at the price of the ROCs.

New renewable technology plants, implemented from 1 April 2017 (onshore wind plants, implemented
as of 12 May 2016), are subject to the new “Contract for Difference” remuneration scheme, or CfD,
which eliminates market risk for 15 years. Such is the case of the East Anglia offshore plant of 714
MW, currently under construction.

The fixed prices for these projects are established on a project-by-project basis through public tenders.
The counterparty guaranteeing this price, “The Low Carbon Contracts Company”, finances its potential
payments by charging a fee to distributors depending on their market share, and therefore the credit
risk with the counterparty is practically zero.

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

As is the case in Spain, the positions exposed to market risk of the renewables businesses in Spain
and the UK are managed and included in their position in the Deregulated businesses in these
countries, to be hedged in the most efficient manner possible.

In addition, the Group has a 15 MW onshore wind farm in the Republic of Ireland at market price.
Renewables business - United State

The Iberdrola Group conducts its renewables business in the US through its listed company Avangrid,
which has an installed capacity of 6,145 MW in onshore wind plants, and 119 MW in operational
photovoltaic plants.

At the present time, approximately 65% of the energy produced is sold on fixed-price long-term
contracts with third parties. Some 17% have coverage contracts of some type, and the remaining 18%
of the energy produced is sold to the market in more or less short terms.

With electricity prices around USD 30/MWh, a 5% change in prices could give rise to an impact of
EUR +4 million on operating results.

Renewables business - Mexico

In Mexico the business now has an installed capacity of 367 MW in operational onshore wind plants,
with two sale schemes: a) fixed-price sale to the CFE on a long-term contract and b) sale to third
parties with a discount on the official price published by the CFE. In addition, 326 MW wind and 270
MW solar plants are being constructed.

The new tariff methodology approved in December 2017 reduces the business’ exposure to market
prices of different commodities in international markets.

Renewables business - Brazil

In Brazil the business now has an installed capacity of 516 MW in onshore wind plants, all operating
on long-term contracts (PPAs) with a fixed price for the country's distributors. Excesses and shortages
in the production contracted with the distributor are settled over periods of four years, and excesses
must be offered and shortages purchased at market prices.

Renewables business in other European countries

The offshore wind farm Wikinger (Germany) is highlighted, with startup forecast for the first quarter of
2018. Pursuant to German regulations, the new Wikinger plant will have a fixed price for the energy it
produces over the first 15 years of operation on a CfD contract, similar to the aforementioned setup in
the UK.

Installed capacity is currently 605 MW in wind plants and 6 MW in photovoltaic facilities operational in
other European countries. Regulations in these countries make a distinction between two energy sale
schemes: sales at the tariff (Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Hungary), or sales at market price
(Romania).

4.5.4. Generation and Retail Businesses

The activities of the Group's deregulated businesses are subject to a range of market, credit, operating,
business and regulatory risks, coming from the uncertainty of the main variables that affect them, such as:
fluctuations in commodity prices, changes in hydroelectric and wind energy production (of both the Group's
and of third parties), changes in electricity and gas demand, and plant availability.

The main variable that affects IBERDROLA’s result in terms of raw materials’ market price is the electricity
price. However, in many countries, electricity prices are strongly correlated with the price of the fuels used
in its production. Therefore, risk studies are carried out on fuel price trends and CO». These price risks are
not only made patent in the electricity generation and retailing business but also in the following activities,
with a much lower weight in the business' total results.

- The gas retailing business, in which a large portion of the IBERDROLA Group's operating
expenses relate to the purchase of gas for customer supplies. The IBERDROLA Group is therefore
exposed to the risk of variations in the price of gas.

- Unhedged energy transactions (discretionary trading).

To a large extent, the mutual closing out of positions by the generation business and retailing business
mitigates the market risk to which the Group is exposed. The remaining risk is mitigated by diversifying sale
and purchase agreements, and specific clauses therein, as well as by arranging derivatives.

Deregulated and retail businesses in Spain

Commodities’ Price risk

Given current market conditions, the production price of the coal-fired power plants defines, to a large
extent, the price of electricity in Spain since coal is the marginal technology necessary to cover electricity
demand. Consequently, the price of coal conditions revenues from the other less expensive technologies
which are used to cover demand. With coal prices around USD 90 per tonne, a 5% change in the prices
could give rise to an impact of EUR +20 million on operating results.

The price of CO2 influences the cost of production in coal-fired power plants. With coal prices around EUR
7 per tonne, a 5% change in the prices could give rise to an impact of EUR +4 million on operating results.

The majority of gas supplied in Spain is paid indexed to the price of oil by means of complex formulas.
IBERDROLA Group has another type of agreements of fixed-price supply and with prices not indexed to
the market price of oil. These agreements are used for electricity generation, for the consumption of its final
customers and for sale to other intermediaries. Due to the fact that the electricity generation margin is
covered by the contracting formulas of the system operator, only residual risk remains in sales to final
customers and third parties. The risk assumed is reduced and depends on the correlation between the
price of oil and the European and international gas prices. In the event of a 5% fluctuation in the oil price,
the risk would be EUR +#1million.

Hydraulic risk

Despite having a large water storage capacity, IBERDROLA Group's results depend significantly on the
flow contributions. The changes in output with respect to the average value can be up to -4,000 GWh ina
dry year and +5,000 GWh in a wet year, the variability would be between EUR +190 million. The loss of
profit is not covered as it is an IBERDROLA Group’s inherent risk.

299 1; BERDROLA


--- Page 45 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

Demand risk

Given the current market condition, where price is primarily determined by the generation cost of coal-fired
plants, which make up around 15% of the generation mix, it is not considered that demand fluctuations will
impact on marginal technology in the market. The impact on the market price of a 1% change in demand is
therefore limited, amounting to approximately EUR 0.25 per MWh.

A moderate drop in demand in Spain does not affect the scheduled output of the Group's nuclear,
hydroelectric and wind power plants, since there is a mandatory electricity market in Spain guaranteeing
the efficient dispatch of output from all technologies.

Nevertheless, there could be an impact if a drop in electricity demand entails an equivalent reduction in the
Group's retail sales and consequent narrowing of margin. This is mitigated to some extent by increasing
sales of own energy on the wholesale market.

Taking both effects into account, it is estimated that a 1% fluctuation in demand would have an impact of
EUR +8.5 million overall.

Operational risk

From the perspective of its impact on business results, the main risk arises from nuclear power plant
outages (due to stoppages for fuel reloading, in accordance with a pre-established schedule) and
hydroelectric power plant outages which are not associated with a large storage reservoir (flow facilities, in
which water is not storable). As a result of such outages, production and, therefore, the margin associated
with this production are lost. This risk is managed through excellence in the operating and maintenance
practices of the plants and a culture focused on total quality and the reduction of operational risks, which
allow the impact of this risk to be kept low.

Deregulated and retail businesses in UK

Commodities’ Price risk

The IBERDROLA Group does not count on having coal plants in the UK after the closure of current plant
Longannet at the end of March 2016. The generation capacity in said country is comprised of 2,000 MW
combined cycles and 566 MW hydraulics plants.

In the British market, geared towards thermal power generation, the clean spark spread has become the
appropriate index to follow the uncertainty of the margins of coal-fired power plants. Despite the fact that
commodities (coal, CO2 and electricity) are listed separately, the uncertainty of the unit margin is studied
since it has been detected that it is a better indicator of the uncertainty of the results. With clean spark
spread levels around GBP 4 per MWh, a 5% change in the spreads could give rise to an impact of EUR 7
million on operating results.

IBERDROLA Group does no longer have long-term agreements at a fixed price.

Recently, the British government has decided to set a maximum price for the gas and electricity tariffs
which a mode of customers pay a “standard variable tariff’. Throughout 2018, the British government will
carry out a question and answer procedure on the calculation method of said maximum price, which is not
expected to enter into effect until 2019. In any case, the setting of this maximum price is expected to

negatively affect the retail business results of the Group in the UK.

Demand risk

300 (9d BERDROLA


--- Page 46 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

Electricity consumption demand is usually one of the most significant risk factors for any company.
However, IBERDROLA currently purchases from third parties a significant portion of the energy it sells (12
TWh in 2017, of a total amount of electricity sold of approximately 22 TWh/year), since it is more profitable
to do so under current market conditions than IBERDROLA producing it and using its own thermal power
plants. From a business perspective, fluctuations in electricity demand mean that additional amounts of
electricity need to be purchased or that these acquisitions need to be reduced. In any case, the profit or
loss IBERDROLA obtains from this intermediation is low and much lower than that obtained from its own
output. Thus, demand fluctuations have a small impact on profit or loss of EUR +10 million for every 1%
luctuation in customer demand.

Operational risk

From the perspective of its impact on business results, the main risk arises from the combined cycle power
plants outages (due to stoppages for fuel reloading, in accordance with a pre-established schedule) . With
regard to these outages, all profit or loss obtained from production is committed, although the high
operating and maintenance standards of the plants and a culture focused on total quality and the reduction
of operational risks, allow the impact on this risk to be kept low.

Deregulated and retail businesses in Mexico

Commodities’ Price risk

Electricity generation at Iberdrola Generacién Mexico is gas-intensive. Gas prices therefore comprise an
essential component of this risk.

Approximately 82% of the electricity generated in Mexico is sold through long-term sales agreements (to
CFE and, to a lesser extent, other major industrial customers), whereby the risk associated with the price of
gas for generating this electricity is passed on.

The remaining energy is sold to customers at a price linked to the official tariffs published by CFE. Said
tariffs depend on the cost of the inherited contracts (originating before the Electricity Sector's recent reform)
and on the market price of electricity.

Demand risk

The structure of the agreements IBERDROLA has entered into in Mexico isolates the business results from
electricity demand fluctuations. Revenues come mainly from plant availability and only the sales indexed at
the official Mexican tariff are subject to a certain extent by the fluctuation in demand. Nonetheless, most of
the plants have committed sales exceeding their production capacity and therefore a shift in demand would
not have an impact on their operations or results as the electricity generated would be sold to another
customer. Changes in electricity demand in Mexico therefore have no effect on results.

Operational risk

From the perspective of its impact on business results, the main risk arises from the combined cycle power
plants outages (due to stoppages for fuel reloading, in accordance with a pre-established schedule) . With
regard to these outages, all profit or loss obtained from production is committed, although the high
operating and maintenance standards of the plants and a culture focused on total quality and the reduction
of operational risks, allow the impact on this risk to be kept low.

Derequlated and retail businesses in Brazil

301 (9d weRDROLA


--- Page 47 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

The Group had 2,113 MW hydraulic generation installed and 533 MW combined cycle in Brazil at year-end,
of which approximately 80% of the hydraulics and 100% of the combined cycle generation are contracted
long-term with electricity distributors in countries through PPA contracts.

The rest of the production is sold to qualified customers with an expectation of between one and two years,
according to Brazilian market prices. With market prices in the area of 220 R$/MWh, a price fluctuation o
5% would affect the results by some EUR 4 million.

Gas supply operations

The IBERDROLA Group maintains an adequate balance in the global mix, both in terms of the number o'
supplier countries and the type of supply (gas via pipelines or GNL), which is demonstrated in that it has
five suppliers from different areas (Norway, Nigeria, United States and Lybia, among others).

In the Spanish case, gas supply is guaranteed through long-term agreements. The 23% of this mix o'
agreements is at a fixed price and the remainder is linked to the prices of various fuels on international
markets.

Gas supply in Mexico is secured through long-term agreements with PEMEX and CFE at a price linked to
international natural gas prices in the US or contracting in the United States and, therefore, with price that
depends on the same gas prices in that country.

Unhedged energy transactions (discretionary tradin

Discretionary trading of electricity, gas, emissions allowances and other fuels and associated products
performed by some of the Group's businesses is residual and the overall risk thereof is mitigated using
individual stop-loss limits, whose total aggregate can never exceed 2% of the Consolidated net profit for the
period, pursuant to the market risk policy approved by IBERDROLA, S.A.'s Board of Directors.
IBERDROLA has reduced discretionary trading in recent years in line with the widespread move away from
market speculation. At the end of December 2017, the notional value of derivatives used in speculative
trading (calculated in accordance with the criteria set forth in the European Market Infrastructure Regulation
(EMIR)) was below EUR 83 million versus EUR 91 million at 31 December 2017. In any case, these values

are much lower than EUR 3,000 million and 1,000 million threshold that is set for non-financial companies
in the European regulation (EMIR).

4.5.5 Other operational risks

All of the IBERDROLA Group’s activities, direct or indirect losses may arise as a result of inadequate
internal procedures, technical failures, human error or external factors.

Specifically, the IBERDROLA Group is also exposed to the following operational risks:

- Risk of malfunctions, explosions, fire, toxic spillages or polluted emissions in gas and electricity
distribution networks and generating plants.

- Risks concerning extreme meteorological conditions and other instances of force majeure.

- Risk of sabotage and/or terrorism.

302 (9d wERDROLA


--- Page 48 ---

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

Any of these risks could cause damage or destruction to the IBERDROLA Group's facilities, as well as
injuries to third parties or damage to the environment, along with the ensuing lawsuits, especially in the
event of power outages caused by accidents at our distribution networks and possible penalties imposed
by the authorities.

Although many of these risks are unpredictable, the IBERDROLA Group mitigates them by carrying out the
necessary investments, implementing operation and maintenance procedures and programmes (supported
by quality control systems), planning appropriate employee training, and taking out the required insurance
covering both material damages and civil liability.

In relation to the insurance cover, IBERDROLA has international insurance programmes to cover equity
(insurance for material damages, machinery breakdowns, loss of profits, damages from natural disasters
and risks arising from construction work) and third-party liabilities (general civil liability, liability for
environmental risks, professional civil liability, etc.).

However, this insurance does not completely eliminate operational risk, since it is not always possible, or it
is not in its interest to pass such risk on to insurance companies. In addition, cover is always subject to
certain limitations.

Risks in connection with nuclear business

The IBERDROLA Group’s nuclear power plants in Spain are also exposed to risks relating to their
operations and risks arising from the storage and handling of radioactive materials.

- Constitutional Spanish law caps the liability of nuclear power plant operators in the event of a
nuclear accident at EUR 700 million. This liability for a nuclear accident must be compulsorily
insured by the operator of Spanish nuclear power plants. The IBERDROLA Group meets this
obligation by taking out Nuclear Civil Liability insurance policies for each plant. However, Law
12/2011, of 27 May, concerning civil liability for nuclear damage or damage caused by radioactive
materials, will increase the operator's liability ceiling and the consequent ceiling on mandatory
insurance to EUR 1,200 million for nuclear power plants. The law will enter into force when all
signatories of the Paris and Brussels Agreements ratify the 2004 Amendment Protocols, as
established in these agreements.

- Accordingly, it is important to point out the indirect economic risk to which the aforementioned
power plants are exposed as a result of a possible serious incident in Spain or in other country
could affect the periodic renewals of their compulsory operating licences and the increase in their
safety investments.

Environmental and climate change risks

IBERDROLA accepts that the environment places constraints on all human activities and is a factor of
companies’ competitiveness, and it is committed to promoting innovation in this field and also eco-
efficiency, to gradually reducing the environmental impact of its activities, facilities, products and services,
and striving to ensure that its activities are congruent with future generations’ legitimate right to an
appropriate environment.

The Group undertakes and promotes this commitment through its policies. IBERDROLA currently has three
specific policies in order to manage environmental issues: environmental policy, anti-climate change policy
and biodiversity policy (available at www.iberdrola.com), which set forth the principles through which the
Company will continue to improve its environmental management.

Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

Moreover, once again IBERDROLA featured on the global Dow Jones Sustainability a worldwide
benchmark for recognising corporate contributions to sustainable development, and also on other
internationally renowned sustainability indexes. It is the only utility to have earned this distinction since the
Index was created in 1999.

With regard to climate change, the Group recognises the gravity of the threat that global warming implies,
to which governments, multi-lateral agencies, the private sector, and society as a whole must necessarily
confront jointly and in a coordinated manner. In this regard, the Company promises to assume a
leadership role in the fight against climate change and develop, among others, the following guiding
principles: i) prevent pollution [by] gradually reducing the intensity of emissions, ii) promote electrification,
energy efficiency and smart grids, iii) support international negotiation procedures and significant
participation of the private sector to fulfil goals 7 and 13 of the SDG approved by the UN, and the climate
goal included in the Paris Climate Summit, iv) support an emissions market that creates a strong and
sustainable price signal, and v) support a tax system that incorporates the "polluter pays" principle that not
only includes the electricity production sector.

Climate change may translate into the following risks in the medium-term:

- More extreme climate situations that impact the generation and distribution assets, such as greater
operation and maintenance costs, and insurance premiums.

- Fluctuations in wind and hydraulic resources
- Fluctuation in the gas and electricity demand levels (due to the effects of temperatures)

- Decrease of the profits forecasted for existing thermal plants (due to regulatory restrictions, CO2
prices, operational events...)

- Impact in wholesale electricity market due to massive development of renewables

- Legislative and regulatory changes
Operational risk of operations in markets
Market trading conducted by the Group's various energy trading desks and treasury dealers is also
exposed to operational risk due to possible inappropriate processes, technological faults, human error,
fraud or any other external or internal event.
This risk is mitigated by following the operational risk policy when trading on the market based on a robust
risk control culture, a proper segregation of duties, the publication of clear processes and policies and
secure and flexible information systems. This policy sets specific thresholds and guidelines applicable to all

trades performed in accordance with the principle of proportionality.

Risks in connection with cybersecurity

IBERDROLA Group companies may be affected by threats and vulnerabilities in connection with
information, control systems or information and communications systems used by the Group, or by any
consequences of unauthorised access to or the use, disclosure, degradation, interruption, modification or
destruction of information or information systems, including the consequences of acts of terrorism.

These risks are managed in accordance with the basic principles of the cybersecurity policy, which takes
the necessary measures to guarantee secure usage of information and communications systems and other
cyber-assets, bolstering detection, prevention, defence and response capacities to counter cyberattacks.

The IBERDROLA Group currently has specific insurance protection against cyber risks under the terms
allowed by the market, and will be regularly reviewed in view of the rapid evolution and extensive variety of
cyber risks.

4.5.6 Legal risks

The IBERDROLA Group companies are part of a certain in-court and out-of-court disputes within the
ordinary course of their activities, the final result of which, in general, is uncertain. An adverse result, or an
out-of-court resolution thereof or other proceedings in the future could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial situation, operating results and cash flows. However, the Group's legal advisers
believe that the outcome of the aforementioned disputes will not have a significant effect.

Notes 6.b. and 45 of the Consolidated financial statements contain a more detailed description of the most
significant matters.

for the new digital customer profile. The digital transformation will be based on new technologies such
as blockchain, big data, the Internet of Things, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, etc. at all levels of
the company.

- Innovation with start-ups, entrepreneurs and suppliers with the aim of developing new disruptive
business models, promoting the exchange of know-how and exerting a pull effect on their employees:

o lberdrola Ventures - PERSEO, IBERDROLA’s start-up programme, was created ten years ago
with the aim of promoting the development of a dynamic ecosystem of start-ups and
entrepreneurs in the electricity sector.

o Innovation programme with suppliers based on three paths of action: facilitating access to
financing mechanisms, pushing firms’ joint creation, and favouring innovative purchasing from
SMEs.

- Culture of innovation and talent: |berdrola promotes a culture of innovation by means of knowledge
transfer, attracting talent and promoting the entrepreneurial spirit:

o lberdrola Universities Programme. In 2017 the Universities Programme was launched, with the
aim of attracting talent, transferring knowledge and contributing to society. In the context of the
programme, lberdrola has signed agreements with the major universities of the countries in which
it is present: Universidad de Salamanca, Universidad Pontificia de Comillas, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology - MIT, Instituto Tecnolédgico de Monterrey and University of Strathclyde.

The programme comprises the following lines of action: Chairs, R&D projects, training of

students, in-house training and young entrepreneurs. During 2017 the first initiatives were carried

out with young entrepreneurs of the reference universities: MIT SANDBOX, Comillas Emprende,

Emprende Salamanca, Iberdrola- SP Entrepreneurial and Energy Business Model Challenge. In

all, five hackathons or boot camps were held, with 800 entrepreneurs and with the collaboration of

more than 100 mentors. We also held more than 25 workshops and delivered more than 2,500

hours of mentoring.

o Accelerator Project. Through this initiative, IBERDROLA expresses its faith in the in-house talent
of its employees and their ability to identify the key factors that will make the company the world’s
biggest utility within ten years. It was led by a multi-discipline group of young employees from
Spain, the UK, the US, Mexico and Brazil which over a two-year period carried out a detailed
analysis of the development and trajectory of a number of successful start-ups that were the
brainchildren of millennials like themselves in various thematic areas such as cultural change,
smart living, customer experience and networks. Many of the resulting ideas are already being
successfully implemented in the various departments of Iberdrola.

The following are some of the most notable innovative initiatives classified by broad area.

6.1. Renewable energies

In 2017, Innovation activities in Renewables focused primarily on:

- Improving operating and maintenance cost efficiency of wind farms, the outstanding example being
the European ROMEO project, coordinated by IBERDROLA, which seeks to develop new models
and tools for the early detection of defects based on big data techniques.

- Improving the integration of energy from renewable sources, several initiatives having been carried
out in the area of energy storage.

- Innovation in offshore wind projects is essential to reduce costs and to limit risks in ongoing and
future projects. During 2017 we completed the installation of the piles, the jacket foundations and
the turbines of the Wikinger offshore wind farm, as well as the commissioning of the sub-station,
with its innovative design featuring a six-legged pre-piled jacket.

We also continue to collaborate on the ‘Best Paths’ and ‘PROMOTION’ European projects in which
HVDC (high-voltage direct current) grids are studied with a view to facilitating the connection of large
volumes of offshore wind-produced electricity to the grid. Another notable project is ‘BRIO’, which
studies the wind farm at the end of its useful life and the valorisation of its high added value
components.

In Brazil we would highlight the play on solar energy in the form of the construction of a pilot CSTP
(concentrating solar thermal power) system with storage in the city of Bahia. IBERDROLA is also
constructing new wind and photovoltaic facilities in various Mexican states.

6.2. Clean generation technologies

During 2017, efforts in the area of generation focused on operating efficiency and flexibility, environmental
protection, and the improvement of plant safety.

Operating efficiency and flexibility and plant safety: The PREXES project to develop a model to predict
expansion in hydraulic concrete structures was completed. Work continued on the VIDAGEN project to
design and develop a tool to manage the global lifespan of pressurised equipment.

In the area of nuclear generation, the prominent projects are FILTRONUC and OPD. The goal of this first
project ended in 2017 is to research and develop a new containment filtered venting system for maximising
filtering performance on the venting line without compromising the safety and integrity of the facilities. And
the second one seeks to develop an open phase detection system for start-up transformers in nuclear
generating stations to establish a solution ensuring optimal functionality as a significant element of safety
and reliability.

Environmental: Iberdrola remains firmly committed to reducing the environmental impact of its generating
plants, backing an ambitious project life entitled CO2ZFORMARE to find a solution to the problem of
macrofouling in the cooling systems of electricity generating plants in a sustainable manner and mitigating
the environmental impact both emissions into the atmosphere and the aquatic environment.

6.3. Commercial Area - New projects and services

Innovation is essential in commercial activity, in order to offer customers the products and services best
suited to their needs. Thus in 2017 IBERDROLA launched the following:

- New initiatives to boost the customer experience:

o Planes a Tu Medida (Customised Plans): new functionalities have been included in the Plan Elige
8 Horas (Choose-8-Hours-Plan). Customers can now choose the 8 hours that best match their
consumption, and they can be different 8-hour periods every day of the week.

o App de Clientes: (Customer App): Improvements in performance and redesign of the application,
with launch dates of year-end 2017 on Android and early 2018 on iPhone. This version will
include improvements in user experience and new functionalities.

- New Smart Home products: Consumption Monitors and Smart Lamps:

In 2017 we launched a product called Riego Inteligente (Smart Irrigation) which allows customers to
schedule and control when they water their gardens from their smartphones or tablets. This product rounds
out the range of smart home products: smart thermostats, electricity meters that break down the
consumption of the main domestic appliances, and smart LED light bulbs that can be controlled from a
smartphone.

As for Smart Solar, a distributed generation solution for self-consumption, in 2017 the following
functionalities were improved: “online offer” thanks to consumption curves and location, and querying of
production, possible storage and grid demand.

IBERDROLA also continues to take part in Green Mobility projects such as REMOURBAN and CIRVE.
REMOURBAN is developing a public recharging network in the city of Valladolid and has designed
methodology for evaluating the sustainability of urban environments, which will be installed in several cities
participating in the project. The CIRVE project also began in 2016, in which Iberdrola assists with the
development of rapid-recharge infrastructure corridors for electric cars, to boost electric mobility and
connect Spain to France and Portugal.

6.4. Smart grids

As regards smart grids and digitisation of the grid, the following may be highlighted in Spain and in the rest
of Europe:

- In Europe, the three-year UPGRID led by IBERDROLA DISTRIBUCION came to an end. It
succeeded in strengthening the operation and maintenance of low-voltage grids in anticipation of
technical problems associated with the large-scale integration of distributed generation. In 2017 the
European Commission financed the ASSURED project, the objective of which is to develop
solutions for quick recharging of heavy electric goods vehicles. Additionally, through EDSO4SG,
IBERDROLA continues to participate in the INTENSIS4EU project, which seeks a new R&D
approach to the smart grid and energy storage in order to face the new integrated energy
challenges in which the consumer is at the centre of the energy system.

- in Spain, we would highlight the GRIDSTORAGE project, in which an advanced microgrid model is
being developed, with storage for distribution grids.

308 (sé BERDROLA

Annual Financial Report
Iberdrola, S.A. and subsidiaries / Financial Year 2017

- In the UK, the Fusion and LV Engine were financed. Both of them aim to optimise low-voltage
grids, which present some of the most significant opportunities and challenges in progress towards
a more flexible system. This financing comes on top of that recently obtained for the innovative
SPEN project, designed to manage restrictions on the high-voltage grid in the Dumfries and
Galloway power stations. Work also continues on developing sustainable solutions for the
deployment of the new smart grid, with the FITNESS project. Other notable projects include
VISOR, which is implementing the first wide area monitoring system (WAMS) in the nationwide IT
infrastructure, and Assess Late, which analyses the future impacts of distributed generation
electric vehicles and increased demand on the grid.

- In Brazil, two of the projects to develop domestic technology for smart networks were BID
MONITOR, a backup system for decision-making concerning sales of electricity, and CIUDADE
INTELIGENTE, to implement an urban reference model based on Smart Grids, should be
highlighted. Moreover, for the project Micro Redes GD, the impact of distributed generation on the
grid and coupling points has been assessed.

- Inthe United States, notable initiatives include those forming part of the Energy Smart Community
(ESC) programme to improve management of the grid and distributed energy resources, ability to
respond to demand and user experience. Also, as part of the Reforming the Energy Vision (REV)
initiative, notable projects are Energy Marketplace, a platform facilitating transactions between
suppliers of distributed generation and customers, and Flexible Interconnect Capacity Solution,
which seeks to define less costly and faster means of connecting to distributed energy resources.

- A regards the Qatar Technological Centre, we would highlight the development of technological
consultancy activities on smart grids and the implementation of metering systems, the launch of
various R&D projects and test benches for the integration of distributed renewable energy and the
management of demand.

6.5. IBERDROLA Ventures — PERSEO

IBERDROLA Ventures — PERSEO is IBERDROLA's Corporate Venture Capital programme.

The programme focuses on the technologies and business models that allow improvements in the
sustainability of the energy model by means of a greater degree of electrification and decarbonisation of
the economy. The most notable activities in 2017 included:

- IBERDROLA was named by the European Commission as one of the companies that works best
with start-ups in the context of the Start-up Europe Partnership initiative. Iberdrola was the only
Spanish energy company selected, and it also received the special Start-up Procurement Award
for its Innovation with Suppliers programme.

- Internationally, we note the taking of an equity stake in the US company Innowatts, which focuses
on the development of digital solutions and innovation for the energy sector by means of its
analytical platform using artificial intelligence, which has data from more than 14 million smart
meters.

- Within the area of social investment, we would highlight the investment in Ilumexico, dedicated to
lighting and electrification in rural areas of Mexico. It is estimated that more than 250,000 people
may benefit from this initiative in the next few years. It is Perseo’s second investment in high-
impact social projects, and forms part of IBERDROLA’s ‘Electricity for All’ programme.

8. FURTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION

8.1. Environmental issues and sustainability

8.1.1. Environmental issues

IBERDROLA accepts that the environment places constraints on all human activities and is a factor of
companies’ competitiveness, and it is committed to promoting innovation in this field and also eco-
efficiency, to gradually reducing the environmental impact of its activities, facilities, products and services,
and striving to ensure that its activities are congruent with future generations’ legitimate right to an
appropriate environment.

The Group undertakes and promotes this commitment through its policies. IBERDROLA currently has three
specific policies in order to manage environmental issues: environmental policy, anti-climate change policy
and biodiversity policy, which set forth the principles through which the Company will continue to improve
its environmental management.

Moreover, for the thirteenth consecutive year IBERDROLA featured on the global Dow Jones Sustainability
Index, a worldwide benchmark for recognising corporate contributions to sustainable development, and
also on other internationally renowned sustainability indexes. It is the only utility to have earned this
distinction since the Index was created in 1999.

8.1.2. Sustainability

IBERDROLA's contribution to sustainable development takes form in certain social responsibility practices
which address the needs and expectations of their stakeholders, with which the Company maintains a
series of lines of communication and dialogue open through which it is able to: communicate objectives,
initiatives and achievements obtained in the three areas of sustainable development (economic,
environmental and social) and receive evaluations and requests from the interested parties.
