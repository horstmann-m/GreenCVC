CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT AT DECEMBER 31, 2017
(Expressed in thousands of euros)

THE SPANISH ECONOMY 2017

The data on economic developments available at the date of preparation of these
consolidated financial statements indicate that in 2017 the Spanish economy will have
advanced 3.1%, equalling the record of the previous two years to show that the
recovery that began in 2013 has been stably maintained over time in spite of the
Catalan political crisis, but while it could have some effect on economic activity, it
seems to be rather limited in scope and in line with what was expected. It is also
estimated that private consumption could have grown by around 2.5% in the year, a
figure that, although five tenths below the record of the previous year, confirms a
positive figure in a component of the GDP that is very relevant for our sector.

In terms of employment, this good evolution of the economy could have resulted in a
fall in the unemployment rate to 16.1% at year end, with a net creation of employment
in the period of around 500,000 people.

This growth continues to be higher than the average for the Eurozone countries, whose
increase is estimated to be around 2.4% in 2018, after the considerable improvement
experienced in 2017, a year in which these economies have reached higher records as
expected, noting the best growth data since 2007, with countries, such as Italy and
France, which after years of very sharp decline have seen their GDPs grow well above
the averages of the last years.

As for the rest of the world, it is estimated that the average growth will be around 3.6%,
while in the United States we find a 2.2% advance that positively compares to the
+1.6% record experienced in the previous year.

The Latin American economies also show signs of improvement, given the case (we
refer mainly to Brazil and Argentina, two of the largest countries in the region) that the
negative growth we witnessed in previous years has turned positive, while Mexico
continues along a path of stable growth despite the uncertainties related to the potential
impact of the protectionist trade measures defended by President Trump.

With regard to Asia and, especially, to China as the largest economy in the area, the
growth records show continuity in relation to those of previous years without, at the
moment, showing signs of the observed trend stopping.

On the other hand, and in spite of the nervousness caused by the populist movements
that triumphed in 2016 and among which the apOproval of Brexit and the election of
Donald Trump as president of the United States in November of that year stand out ina
very significant way, the result of the electoral processes carried out in 2017
(particularly in France and Germany) seems to have confirmed a climate of greater
stability and orthodoxy with regard to economic policy.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT AT DECEMBER 31, 2017
(Expressed in thousands of euros)

At the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements, it seems that in
2018 we will see a continuation of the good economic management noted in 2017, both
in terms of the United States, where the expansive fiscal policies put into operation by
the Trump Administration allow us to expect higher growth than that experienced in
2017, as in Europe, where the GDP of the EU countries is expected to rise above 2%.

As for Spain, the estimates point to a GDP evolution that is still above the European
average, although somewhat more contained than in previous years (the consensus is
2.6%), but which would ultimately guarantee positive behaviour of private consumption
and also an additional reduction in the unemployment rate up to (always according to
the consensus of analysts) levels of around 15%. This lower growth is explained by the
rise in oil prices, a lower momentum of the expansionary monetary policy, the
exhaustion of domestic demand, a neutral fiscal policy and some residual effect of the
Catalan political situation.

It is expected, therefore, that all components of private demand will grow in 2018 in
Spain, with private consumption rising.

In this environment of moderate but steady growth, it remains to be determined
whether finally the European Central Bank (ECB), in view of the positive developments
in the Eurozone economies and the emergence of positive inflation rates will begin to
change the expansive monetary policy put into practice in recent years, which would
imply a rise in interest rates, which are currently at historic lows. In these moments it
seems reasonable to speculate that the ECB will be cautious and that it will modify its
policy only when the structural imbalances that justified the quantitative easing
measures have disappeared and unequivocal confirmation of the absence of deflation
as well as the transit through a path of sustained economic growth have been
unequivocally confirmed.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT AT DECEMBER 31, 2017
(Expressed in thousands of euros)

The activity of the Group focuses on the exploitation of advertising on the television
channels of which it is a concessionaire, as well as the performance of analogous and
complementary activities related to said activity, such as:

-Audio-visual production

-News agency

- Promotion Advertising

THE TELEVISION BUSINESS IN 2017

As indicated in the Management Reports accompanying the consolidated financial
statements for the years 2015 and 2016, investment in TV advertising grew by 6.4% in
the former and 5.5% in the latter, records which, sequentially, showed a very slight
decreasing behaviour in terms of margins that was explained because, on the one
hand, the comparisons with the previous years were increasingly demanding and, on
the other, because TV advertising had begun to take off at least six months before the
economy as a whole took off, a factor that tended to displace the bases of comparison
as the cycle became established.

With regard to 2017, official TV advertising market data released by Infoadex shows
growth of 1%, a significant lower figure than last year and lower than the increase in
GDP experienced during the year.

In fact, this final figure is a reflection of the great year-on-year volatility that has been
observed throughout the year, with very different quarterly evolutions and, particularly,
with a second quarter that, after a robust start to the year, recorded a negative
development, something that has not occurred since before the start of the market
recovery.

As of July, advertising started to behave in a slightly more positive way with respect to
the previous year, demonstrating that, although flatter than in the initial phase of the
advertising recovery cycle after 2013, in which the growth multiple was several times
higher than GDP, its evolution was still correlated with it.

In any case, as already stated in the Annual Corporate Management Report for 2016,
this year has confirmed that advertisers remain very careful in planning their campaigns
and very tactical in deciding at what point to invest, which has resulted in greater
market volatility both month by month and each quarter.

On the other hand, the 2017 data confirms once again that TV advertising continues to
be the predominant medium in the global advertising market as a whole, with a weight
of 40%, that is, only five tenths less than the percentage recorded in 2016, and this is
despite the strength shown by online advertising, which, with the data available at the
date of preparing this Management Report, already reaches 28.9% of the global
advertising.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT AT DECEMBER 31, 2017
(Expressed in thousands of euros)

Once again, television consumption (measured in minutes per viewer and day) has
continued to show strength since, although with decreases from the historical highs
reached in mid-2013 (data which, on the other hand, were surely inflated by the
severity of the economic crisis), it continues to record some of the highest figures in our
environment, which is undoubtedly a clear sign of the good health of the television

medium as a commercial communication tool.

As for prices, they have continued their recovery in the year, albeit at a slower pace
than in previous years, it estimated that at year-end half of what was lost from the
market highs registered in 2007 would still have to be recovered, while advertising

occupation approached levels close to full occupancy in the year.

Regarding Mediaset Group, it is worth noting that in 2017 we have achieved a share of
43.3% of investment according to Infoadex data, a record identical to that of 2016,
which is worthy in itself, as in 2017 there was no important sporting events, whereas in
the previous year the football European Championship hosted by France was
broadcast. This percentage places us 1.9 points away from our main competitor, which

scores 41.4%, a distance 0.7 points higher than in 2016.

"As for the audience, the data of the year" show that our Group continues to be a world
leader with a 27.3% audience share and marks a 0.8 points difference with our main
competitor, all this in a year in which no relevant sporting events have been broadcast
and the new channels that were granted at the end of 2015 have been fully operative

throughout

The Telecinco channel has once again led the audience with 12.4%, 1 tenth of a
difference from its main competitor while Cuatro reached 5.9% and the rest of the
thematic channels of the Group 9%, that placed them at a distance of 1.7 points

compared to its main competitor‚Äôs the thematic channels, all in a television year which,

in the last part, was marked by the impact of the Catalan crisis in terms of audiences

and their political news component.

Comparing the Group‚Äôs results in 2016 with those of 2017, the following can be seen:

¬¢ Operating income increased from 991,983 thousand euros in 2016 to 996,257
thousand euros in 2017, mainly due to the increase in advertising revenues

during the year.

¬¢ Operating expenses go from 767,548 thousand euros in 2016 to 750,917
thousand euros in 2017, a reduction that reflects both the impact of the
European Football Championship in the previous year and the continuation of
the traditional cost management model that is fundamental part of the Group's

business strategy.

(Expressed in thousands of euros)

e Finally, the Parent Company‚Äôs net result for 2017 stood at 197,496 thousand
euros compared to the 170,997 thousand euros recorded in 2016, a very
significant improvement that is primarily explained by the recovery of operating
margins experienced in the year as result of both the increase in operating
income and, in particular, from the control of expenses.

DIVIDENDS

In 2017, an ordinary dividend was distributed with a charge to the 2016 results
amounting to 147,201 thousand Euros, a figure that was supplemented by an
extraordinary dividend of 28,519 thousand Euros.

INVESTMENT IN RIGHTS AND IN CINEMA

The Mediaset Espafia Group continues with its investment in audio-visual rights policy,
applying a careful selection in terms of type and content in order to sustain future
audience ratings and ensure optimal advertising exploitation.

Likewise, the Group places special emphasis on investment in national production
series.

The activities undertaken by Telecinco Cinema are worth highlighting, a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Group in charge of the legally required film production of TV
concessionaires to allocate 3% of operating revenue towards Spanish and European
film production.

As investment in film production arises from a legal obligation and not a decision made
freely by the network, the Group has opted for quality and ambitious projects based on
global strategic criteria guiding its activity in this field. Where possible, it opts for
productions of a certain size and scope that are apt for international showing, taking
into account market conditions and the Group‚Äôs financing capacity, as this obligation
outweighs the revenues generated, regardless of the trend and without any
consideration to costs incurred or margins obtained.

In short, the aim is to efficiently combine financial capability, talent, profitability, and
opportunities for our brightest and most promising professionals in order to maximise
the return on investment -in light of global conditions, maximum importance is attached
to this- considering that the activity is not voluntary, and to produce films that combine
quality and commercial appeal under the Group‚Äôs distinctive logo.

In line with the fantastic results obtained in 2015 and 2016, 2017, once again this was
an extraordinary year, with four productions released which, as a whole, have attracted
8 million spectators and raised 47 million euros, which is no less than 48% of the box
office raised by the 188 Spanish films released in the year. Those titles are:

INTERNET

Our Group has reinforced its commitment to digital activity during 2017, in the overall
calculation of the year the company has managed to become the company with the
largest video consumption online in the audio-visual sector with a monthly average of
81.1 million videos viewed compared to the 59.4 million registered by its main
competitor. In addition, and with an average of 348 million minutes seen per month, it is
placed sixth in the global Internet ranking after Google Sites, Openload, Facebook,
Vevo and Broadband TV.

Once again, the users loyalty towards the Mediaset Espafa‚Äôs webs has been
demonstrated throughout the year, registering a monthly average video consumption
per viewer that stands at 3 hours and 53 minutes, a figure far ahead of that which its
main competitor has (1 hour and 37 minutes).

On the other hand, unique users have increased by 8.2% compared to the previous
year to reach 11.5 million, placing Telecinco.es (7.7 million unique users and 26.7
million videos seen as a monthly average in the year) well ahead of its main competitor,
which has scored 7.1 and 3.7 million respectively), while Mitele, with an average of 2.5
million unique users and 48 million videos viewed per month, is also ahead of the
competition, something which is also repeated in terms of minutes consumed.

It should be noted that during the first half of 2017 the Group‚Äôs main websites were
updated to achieve a better adaptation to both the new technological environment and
changing consumer habits, resulting in mobile consumption of our content now
exceeding 76%.

These modifications have made it possible to homogenise the browsing experience
and optimise the content load while reducing loading times and improving advertising
formats without penalising user navigation.

From an editorial point of view, the efforts to reach new audiences have been renewed
during the year, especially with regard to the new MTMad Internet video channel, which
has boosted the Group's digital content offer and multiplied its value for advertisers and
users.

Also, in 2017, new projects have been launched such as a new website with digital
content and another dedicated to promoting sports that includes stories of
achievement, effort and solidarity.

In the area of children and youngsters, a new entertainment platform has been created
in HD and accessible from Mitele.es equipped with parental control.

Finally, at the end of 2017, a subscription alert system was put into operation to better
inform users about the news on our websites and efforts have been multiplied to
improve our content‚Äôs positioning on search engines.

TREASURY SHARES

The Company owns 9,282,275 treasury shares whose nominal value as of December
31, 2017 represents 2.76% of the share capital (4,641 thousand euros of nominal
value), being below the maximum allowed by the Companies Act for listed companies.

The increases as of December 31, 2017 correspond to the implementation of the Share
Repurchase Plan approved on February 23, 2017.

The decreases as of December 31, 2017 are mainly due to the remuneration of
employees through shares.

The book value of the treasury shares at 31 December 2017 amounted to 100,500
thousand euros (0 thousand euros at December 31, 2016).

PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS
During 2017, the average payment to the Group‚Äôs national suppliers was 70 days.

This difference is notable when compared to the maximum stipulated by payment
arrears regulations and is exclusively due to the rigorous control exercised by the
Group with regard to commercial and tax requirements to be met by invoices received,
meaning that they are not paid until the incidents detected have not been resolved. The
Group scrupulously meets its commitments with regard to legislation aimed at battling
late payments.

MEDIASET ESPANA SHARE PRICE

The year 2017 began in a climate of considerable political uncertainty, derived both
from the events that occurred in 2016 ("Brexit", election of Donald Trump as president
of the United States) and the relevant electoral processes scheduled for the year
(France and Germany fundamentally), all of which seemed to point towards a stock
market marked by volatility.

However, the markets‚Äô reaction was the opposite to that expected, with most markets
observing sustained growth and historical records were reached in the United States,
Germany and the United Kingdom.

In this sense, the best behaviours with regard to European markets took place in the
FTSE, in the Italian FTSE MIB (+ 13.6% in the year), the German DAX30 (+ 12.5%),
CAC40 French (+ 9.3%) and British FTSE100 (+ 7.6%), while the Euro Stoxx50, the
European benchmark index that brings together the largest listed companies in the
continent, was revalued by 6.5%.

The United States, have reached the most relevant indicators, as previously stated,
historical highs; the Nasdaq closed the year with an increase of 28.2% followed by the
Dow Jones which grew by 25.1%, while the S&P500 was revalued by 19.4%.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT AT DECEMBER 31, 2017
(Expressed in thousands of euros)

The conclusion is that good macroeconomic data at a global level added to low
volatility have encouraged investors to opt for equities.

With respect to Spain, the IBEX35 rose by 7.4% in the year (which is the best figure
since 2013), with 24 stocks on the rise and with an interannual evolution marked by a
very positive first part (up to May the increase was almost 20% surpassing 11,100
points) and one last evolution marked by the Catalan political crisis that resulted in
many investors withdrawing from the market fearful of the possible negative
consequences of the process. The final balance was that the market closed positively
in seven of the twelve months of the year, reaching minimums on January 23 (9,305
points) and reaching its highest record on May 5 11,120 points), Santander, BBVA and
Telefonica being the most traded securities in the year (40% of the total volume
thereof).

Regarding Mediaset Espajia, the share price closed the year at 9.36 euros, with a drop
of 16.1%. The maximum price was registered on May 4 when it reached 13 euros; from
there, and coinciding with the uncertainties concerning the status of a foreign
broadcaster, which produced a contagion effect to other operators in the sector, the
share price began to fall, until on November 10 it registered its worst record (8.62
euros).

The daily average shares traded during the year was 1,290,029 (equivalent to 14,153
thousand euros), down 19% over the previous year and the total traded volume stood
at 3,609.124 thousand euros, with a negative variation of 14.5% with respect to the
previous year. The total volume of shares traded stood at 354.3 million compared with
411.5 million the previous year, the month of May being the month in which the most
Mediaset Espafia shares were traded, coinciding with the annual dividend payment.

The market capitalization of Mediaset Espafia as of December 31, 2017, was
3,151.339 thousand euros, which ranked it 30th in the Ibex35 and, despite having lost
around 603,061 thousand euros in capitalisation in the year, it continued once again as
an undisputed leader among the Spanish companies in the sector, with a capitalisation
of 33% higher than all of them and making a difference of 1,187,463 thousand euros
with respect to its main competitor AtresMedia, which allowed it to position itself in
fourth place within of the European broadcasters, immediately behind ITV, Prosieben
and Mediaset SpA.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Good practice in corporate governance means establishing rules, principles, and
incentives at companies that help safeguard the interests of the company and its
shareholders, and guarantee greater transparency in management.

Mediaset Espafa‚Äôs commitment to the regulations and principles of good governance
has been evident since it first was listed on the market in 2004. Since then, our focus
has been on adapting our different regulating bodies to the Code of Good Governance

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD

At the date of preparing this Management Report, no significant events have occurred
after the end of 2017.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE

The Company's share capital amounts to 168,359 thousand euros, representing
336,717,490 shares as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. All of them are represented
by book entries and are of the same class.

The Company's shares are listed on the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia Stock
Exchanges. The ISIN Code is ES0152503035.

As of January 3, 2005 Mediaset Espafia Comunicaci√©n, S.A. is a company listed on the
IBEX 35.

THE COMPANY‚ÄôS BUSINESS OUTLOOK

It is a well-known fact that our business is mainly dependent on advertising, which in
turn has historically been closely and directly linked to private consumption trends and
its perspectives, as well as disposable family income and unemployment figures.
However, a perspective on how these variables interact must be based on a sufficient
period of time; otherwise, results can be misleading.

In addition, this correlation is affected by the duration of the advertising cycle and by
the time in which the activity takes place.

It is therefore superfluous to highlight that our Group's business in 2018 cannot be
separated from the general macroeconomic context in which we operate, nor from the
correlated figures, although this interdependence would have to be qualified with the
factors of cyclicality and of year-on-year volatility already mentioned.

It has already been explained in this Management Report that the data for 2017 shows
that the Spanish economy has continued to grow at a sustained pace and showing one
of the highest rates in our environment, estimating that in 2018 the main
macroeconomic variables will continue increasing, although at somewhat lower levels
as a result of the end of a tailwinds that were present in past years and also as a
consequence of the political situation in Catalonia.

In this sense, if we consider the most authoritative economic forecasts, it is expected
that the Spanish GDP growth this year will be slightly less than in 2017 (the consensus
stands at 2.5% increase in private consumption advancing at a rate somewhat less). Of
course, these forecasts do not take into account exogenous or imponderable factors in
the international arena that could affect our economy.

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT AT DECEMBER 31, 2017
(Expressed in thousands of euros)

With regard to the activity of free-to-air television, we hope that the process of
consolidation and normalisation of the sector that we have witnessed in recent years
will continue, we do not foresee a change in the existing operator and channel
landscape that was left fixed after the allocation of six new channels at the end of 2015.

We also hope that the advertising cycle will continue upwards as a result of the
underlying economic growth; in this context, the recovery of advertising prices, which
were so severely punished during the crisis, will continue to be a priority although it will
be more in line with the point of the cycle in which we find ourselves and always in the
characteristic volatile environment in the short term that has been a constant in recent
years.

We also expect that, based on the data of both television consumption measured in
minutes / day and the weight of free-to-air television in global audio-visual consumption
through the different platforms, the participation of television advertising revenues in
global advertising as a whole is stable as it has been in recent years, a demonstration
of the importance of TV as a means of distributing advertising messages because of its
penetration, simultaneity in its reach to consumers, uniformity in methods for measuring
audiences, impacts and security of its surroundings, as it is a highly regulated
environment.

We will also continue our efforts to ensure the distribution of our content across all
platforms and devices available to viewers (TV, online platforms, etc.), investing both in
financial resources and personnel on line with what we have been doing in recent
years, always with a strategy based on selling advertising across various media as the
primary source of income.

In this changing market and with the new ways of distributing audio-visual content, our
Group's business strategy will continue to focus on maintaining our leading position
both in terms of audience and the exploitation of the advertising market, with a strong
presence in terms of in-house produced content both through our own means and in
association with independent producers that include those in which we have a non-
controlling interest.

Indeed, we consider that a powerful and varied in house production is a singular point
of strength both to provide us with exclusive content that has historically been blessed
by the public‚Äôs support and to compete effectively with the new players operating in the
Spanish market.

We will also continue with the marketing strategy for in-house production, which,
although it still represents a small percentage of our revenues, it has been progressing
at a good pace in recent years and is a profitable business line with a future.

In terms of costs, we will continue with our traditional approach, with the objective of
adapting ourselves to the environmental conditions that affect income generation and
helped by the weight of our in-house production, to determine an optimal basis that

allows the maximisation of our margins and our cash flows taking advantage of the
operating leverage that is inherent to our sector.

In reference to our programming grid we will continue to exploit the genres that have
historically been enjoying the audience‚Äôs support and that have made us the leading
Group, as well as our strategy of diversification and targeting audiences through our
family of channels in order to achieve a better rapport with the audience and also a
more effective business card for our clients. In this context, we believe the broadcast of
the 2018 Russian Football World Cup matches acquired will be the perfect
complement, for its notoriety and relevance, to underpin our business strategy in the
year.

Finally, maintaining a solid financial and equity position (while remaining debt-free and
with positive cash- flow), thereby making it possible to objectively and independently
consider operational and business opportunities as they arise within the context of the
current ever-changing environment, while bolstering the Group‚Äôs competitive edge in
the face of the high financial leverage which affects the majority of the companies
competing in its sector.

Also, once our sector‚Äôs economic situation seems more normalised, we will maintain
our shareholder remuneration policies based on distribution (using the different
measures at our disposal, dividends, the purchase of treasury shares, or others) of
surplus cash.
