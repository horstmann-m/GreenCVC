GENERAL
INFORMATION
ABOUT THIS
GROUP MANAGE-
MENT REPORT

In the following, we present a discussion and analysis
of the Group Management Report of Fresenius
Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA and its subsidiaries (to-
gether referred to as we, our, FMC AG&CO. KGAA,
Fresenius Medical Care, the Group or the Company)
prepared in accordance with sections 315 and 315 e of
the German Commercial Code and German Account-
ing Standards No. 17 and 20, as well as the consolidat-
ed financial statements and related notes contained
elsewhere in this report. Some of the statements,
including those concerning future revenue, costs and
capital expenditures, possible changes in our industry
as well as the competitive and financial conditions
include forward-looking statements. We made these
forward-looking statements based on the expecta-
tions and beliefs of the Management Board of the
Company's General Partner (Management Board)
pertaining to future events that may affect us, but
which we cannot assure that such events will occur
or that the results will be as anticipated. Because
these statements involve opportunities, risks and un-
certainties, the actual results may differ materially
(positively as well as negatively) from the results
which the forward-looking statements express or im-
ply. The statements cover the content of and are sub-
ject to the uncertainties described in the discussions
in this report in the “Outlook” starting on page 55 and in
the “Risks and opportunities report” starting on page 59
as well as in notes 2 and 22 of the notes to the consoli-
dated financial statements.

The non-financial group report is not part of
the Group Management Report. It is part of a sepa-
rate chapter of the Annual Report and will be dis-
closed together with the Group Management Report.
The non-financial group report can be found starting
on page 78.

Due to rounding, individual numbers and per-
centages presented in this report may not reflect the
absolute figures precisely.

Our business is also subject to other opportuni-
ties, risks and uncertainties that we describe in our
public filings. Developments in any of these areas
could cause our results to differ materially to those
that we or others have projected or may project.

OVERVIEW
ABOUT THE GROUP

We provide high-quality health
care solutions for patients with
chronic kidney failure. Our inno-
vative products and therapies
set high standards in dialysis
treatment.

BUSINESS MODEL

OPERATIONS AND
COMPANY STRUCTURE

Fresenius Medical Care is the world’s largest dialysis
company, based on publicly reported revenue and
the number of patients treated. We provide dialysis
care and related services to people with chronic kid-
ney failure as well as other health care services. We
also develop and manufacture a full range of dialysis
machines, systems and disposable products, which
we sell to customers in around 150 countries as well
as using them in our internal health care service
operations. Our dialysis business is therefore verti-
cally integrated. We describe our other health care
services as “Care Coordination”. Together with dialy-
sis services Care Coordination represents our health
care services.

We generate most of our revenue with dialysis
products and dialysis care services. In our 3,752 dialy-
sis clinics in around 50 countries worldwide, we pro-
vide care for over 320,000 dialysis patients. We are
continuously developing this network of clinics,
which is the largest and most international in the
world, to accommodate the ever rising number of
dialysis patients. At the same time, we operate
41 production sites in more than 20 countries. The
most important plants for dialyzer production are in
St.Wendel (Germany), Ogden (u.s.), Changshu
(China), L’Arbresle (France) and Buzen (Japan). Dialy-
sis machines are manufactured in Schweinfurt (Ger-
many) and in Concord (U.S.).

Fresenius Medical Care is organized decentral-
ly and divided into the regions North America, Europe,
Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia-Pacific and Latin
America; our operating segments correspond to this

regional breakdown (the term “North America
Segment” refers to our North America operating
segment; the term “EMEA Segment” refers to the
Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segment,
the term “Asia-Pacific Segment” refers to our Asia-
Pacific operating segment, and the term “Latin Amer-
ica Segment” refers to our Latin America operating
segment).

Fresenius Medical Care’s company headquar-
ters is in Bad Homburg v.d. Hohe, Germany. The
headquarters in North America, our most important
region in terms of revenue, is in Waltham, Massa-
chusetts (U.S.).

Chart 2.1 on page 20 Shows an overview of our most
important production sites and headquarters.

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Fresenius Medical Care provides mainly dialysis prod-
ucts and services. We also offer non-dialysis services
as part of Care Coordination, as well as non-dialysis
products. see chart 2.2 on page 21 for an overview of our
services and products.

Approximately 3.2M patients worldwide regu-
larly underwent dialysis treatment in 2017. Dialysis is
a life-saving blood cleansing procedure that substi-
tutes the function of the kidney in case of kidney
failure. Healthy kidneys clean the blood of waste
products, regulate water levels, and produce import-
ant hormones. If the kidneys are irreparably damaged
and are therefore no longer able to function ade-
quately for a lengthy period of time, this is known as
chronic kidney failure. Many diseases can lead to
chronic kidney failure, particularly diabetes, chronic
nephritis, and high blood pressure. There are current-
ly two treatment options for chronic kidney failure:
a kidney transplant and dialysis.

Our health care products

We develop and manufacture a wide variety of health

care products, which includes both dialysis and

non-dialysis products.
The dialysis products that we offer in around

150 countries around the world focus on the following

areas:

> Hemodialysis (HD) — HD is by far the most com-
mon type of therapy for chronic kidney failure.
Fresenius Medical Care provides a wide range
of HD products, e. g. machines, dialyzers, blood-
line systems, HD solutions and concentrates,
water treatment systems, as well as data pro-
cessing and analysis systems.

> Peritoneal dialysis (PD) — In PD the peritoneum
is used as a natural filter. We offer systems and
solutions for continuous ambulatory peritoneal
dialysis (CAPD) and automated peritoneal dialy-
sis in dialysis centers as well as at home.

> Acute dialysis — In case of a sudden loss of renal
function continuous renal replacement therapy
is used in intensive-care units. Fresenius Medical
Care also provides products for this.

Additionally, we offer non-dialysis products that in-
clude acute cardiopulmonary products and products
for the apheresis therapy. This therapy can be used
to remove excess blood fats or pathogenic antibodies.

Our health care services

Dialysis services

Dialysis patients receive life-saving dialysis treatment
and other associated services such as laboratory tests
in our 3,752 (2016: 3,624) dialysis clinics worldwide.
Dialysis treatment at our clinics is usually performed
three times a week over a period of several hours by
trained medical staff. We also provide medical sup-
port and training for home dialysis patients.

2.2 RANGE OF SERVICES

Health care services

ae

We treated most of our patients (62%) in the
North America Segment, 19% in the EMEA Segment,
10% in the Latin America Segment and 9% in the
Asia-Pacific Segment.

Fresenius Medical Care is able to operate its
own dialysis clinics in countries where the health care
system allows private-sector companies to provide
medical services and an appropriate reimbursement
system is in place.

Care Coordination

Care Coordination enables us to expand and grow our
business beyond dialysis, for example in markets
where the privatized dialysis market is relatively well
developed and we already have a high market share.
Although Care Coordination is a business with a glob-
al focus, we currently mainly provide non-dialysis
services in our largest market, the u.s., and in Asia-
Pacific. In recent years, the health care system in the
u.s. has moved away from reimbursement of individ-
ual services towards holistic and coordinated care.
Our activities in Care Coordination and our experi-
ence in dialysis mean that we can participate in the
development of the u.s. health care system and use
this as a basis for additional growth. At the same time,
patients benefit from coordinated care, and health
care systems from lower costs.

MAJOR MARKETS AND
COMPETITIVE POSITION

According to our estimates, the number of dialysis
patients worldwide reached 3.2m in 2017 (2016:
3.0M) — a 6% growth rate. In the same period, 320,960
patients were treated in Fresenius Medical Care’s
network of dialysis centers (2016: 308,471). As such,
Fresenius Medical Care holds the leading position
worldwide in dialysis care. More information can be
found in chart 2.3.

Dialysis products made by Fresenius Medical
Care for use in our own dialysis centers or sale to
third-party product customers represented a share of
35% in 2017 (2016: 34%). Fresenius Medical Care is
therefore also the global market leader for dialysis
products. For hemodialysis products, we had a mar-
ket share of 39% worldwide (2016: 38%) and are the
global market leader in this field as well.

Dialyzers for hemodialysis are the largest prod-
uct group in the dialysis market with a worldwide
sales volume of more than 300M units in 2017. More
than 140M (around 45%) of these were made by
Fresenius Medical Care, so that we hold by far the
biggest market share. Hemodialysis machines consti-
tute another key component of our product business.
Here, too, we are the clear market leader. Of the
90,000 machines estimated to have been installed in
2017, more than 50,000, or more than 50% (2016: more
than 50%), were produced by Fresenius Medical Care.

Furthermore, we hold a strong position in the
market for peritoneal dialysis products: Around 17%
(2016: around 17%) of all patients use products made
by Fresenius Medical Care.

Fresenius Medical Care is also the worldwide
leader in dialysis care, serving about 10% of all dialy-
sis patients. In the U.s., Fresenius Medical Care treats
around 38% of all dialysis patients.

Outside the u.s., dialysis services are consider-
ably more fragmented. With more than 1,370 dialysis
clinics and around 127,000 patients in around 50 coun-
tries, Fresenius Medical Care operates by far the larg-
est and most international network of clinics.

PROCUREMENT
AND PRODUCTION

The Global Manufacturing & Quality (GMQ) division
centrally manages all of Fresenius Medical Care’s activ-
ities worldwide in the procurement of raw materials
and semi-finished goods, production including quality
management, and distribution in North America. This
centralized approach enables us to
> continuously enhance the efficiency

of our processes,

optimize cost structures,

improve returns on our capital invested

in manufacturing,

respond more flexibly and

fulfill our commitment to meeting

high-quality and safety standards.

The objective of our production strategy is to manu-
facture top-quality products in the right place at the
right time on the best possible terms. We are able to
successfully implement this strategy thanks to a net-
work of large production sites, where we make tech-
nically sophisticated products for sale worldwide, as
well as smaller production sites that primarily supply
products regionally.

Strategic purchasing at Fresenius Medical Care
is geared toward ensuring the availability, safety and
quality of the materials used in production with the
aim of further expanding our competitive and inter-
nationally balanced supplier network.

At the end of 2017, Gmq had 16,186 employees
(full-time equivalents) (2016: 15,224). In total, we oper-
ate 41 production sites in more than 20 countries.

CORPORATE STRATEGY
AND OBJECTIVES

“Fresenius Medical Care: Creating a future worth liv-
ing. For patients. Worldwide. Everyday.” This vision
guides us in giving our patients around the world a
better life by offering them high-quality products
and outstanding health care. It is based on our core
values: quality, honesty and integrity, innovation and
progress, respect, and dignity. These values are en-
shrined in our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct,
which describes our business standards and under-
lines our commitment to operating in accordance
with the applicable laws and regulations and with
our own company policies.

STRATEGIC CORE COMPETENCIES

Fresenius Medical Care aims to further consolidate its
expertise as the world’s largest provider of top-
quality dialysis treatments and products and to apply
them as a basis for sustainable, profitable growth.
Moreover, by expanding our range of medical services
in the area of Care Coordination, our goal is to pro-
vide holistic care and improve outcomes for patients
as well as payers and at the same time sustainably
increase the company value of Fresenius Medical
Care. Our strategic plan is built around four core com-
petencies — see chart 2.4 — that will support us in the
years to come.
> Innovating products
Developing innovative products to achieve even
better outcomes for our patients is an inherent
part of our strategy of sustainable, profitable
growth and reinforces our technology leader-
ship position in dialysis. In addition, we strive to
identify new opportunities in value-added tech-
nologies and approaches on an ongoing basis,
for example through our Fresenius Medical Care
Ventures fund.

Standardizing medical procedures

Our goal is to standardize medical treatments
and clinical processes while continuing to en-
sure high-quality clinical outcomes. We provid-
ed around 48M dialysis treatments worldwide
in 2017. Consequently, we have one of the larg-
est renal patient databases in the world. We in-
tend to use this information to standardize
medical settings, ramp up new clinics and inte-
grate acquired clinics based on proven and ef-
ficient concepts.

Coordinating patients efficiently

In an environment of increasing patient num-
bers and changing health care systems,
Fresenius Medical Care sees significant poten-
tial in providing value-based care. This ap-
proach focuses on selling solutions, providing
holistic care and receiving outcome-based re-
imbursement rather than offering single prod-
ucts or services. Depending on the type of
health care network in which we participate,
we coordinate the care of our patients with
other providers including physicians and other
health care facilities. We then use the accumu-
lated patient information provided to create
predictive analytics.

Operating outpatient facilities

By leveraging our experience gained in current-
ly 3,752 proprietary dialysis clinics in around
50 countries, we have the knowledge to oper-
ate and manage stand-alone outpatient clinics
efficiently and capture economies of scale. We
are continuously optimizing and modernizing
our processes and administrative structures.

GROWTH STRATEGY 2020

Based on our strategic core competencies, we set

ourselves long-term targets in 2014 with our growth

strategy 2020 (Vision 2020):

> Accelerate revenue growth: The aim is to in-
crease Fresenius Medical Care’s revenue to
€24BN by 2020 based upon exchange rates
prevailing at the beginning of 2017 and exclud-
ing the effect from IFRS 15 implementation,
corresponding to an average annual growth
rate of around 10%. This increase in revenue
should stem from both organic growth and
acquisitions.

> Deliver sustainable and profitable growth: We
expect high single-digit annual growth in
net income based upon exchange rates pre-
vailing at the beginning of 2017 and excluding
the recurring impacts from the u.s. Tax Re-
form (€140M to €160M annually) in the years
2018-2020. In 2017, we also announced the sec-
ond phase of our Global Efficiency Program
(GEP I). Starting in 2018, GEP II targets to achieve
sustained cost improvements of €100 M to €200M
per annum by 2020.

> Expand our Care Coordination business:
Fresenius Medical Care intends to achieve an
annual average revenue growth rate of 15 to 20%
in Care Coordination by 2020, based upon ex-
change rates prevailing at the beginning of 2017,
corresponding to 17% of total revenue in 2017.

For further information on our goals, see the “Out-
look” starting on page 55.

PERFORMANCE
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The Management Board oversees our Company by
setting strategic and operational targets and measur-
ing various financial key performance indicators used
for internal management determined in euro based
upon IFRS.

The key performance indicators used for inter-
nal management are the same in all the individual
operating segments.

Each operating segment is evaluated based on
target figures that reflect the revenue and expenses
they control. The effects of certain transactions and
income taxes are not included as we believe these
items to be outside the operating segments’ control.
Financing is a corporate function, which the operating
segments do not control. Therefore, we do not include
interest expense relating to financing as an operating
segment measurement. Similarly, we do not allocate
certain costs which relate primarily to certain head-
quarters’ overhead charges, including accounting and

finance, global research and development, etc. be-
cause we believe that these costs are also not within
the control of the individual operating segments.
Certain of the following key performance indi-
cators and other financial information as well as dis-
cussions and analyses set out in this report include
measures that are not defined by iFrrs (Non-IFRS Mea-
sure). We believe this information, along with com-
parable IFRS measurements, is useful to our investors
as it provides a basis for assessing our performance,
payment obligations related to performance-based
compensation as well as our compliance with cove-
nants. Non-iFrs financial measures should not be
viewed or interpreted as a substitute for financial
information presented in accordance with IFRs.

REVENUE

The management of our operating segments is based
on revenue as a key performance indicator. We be-
lieve that the key to continue growing our revenue
is to attract new patients and increase the number
of treatments performed each year. The number of
treatments performed each year is therefore an indi-
cator of continued revenue growth. Revenue is also
benchmarked based on movement at constant ex-
change rates. For further information see the “Con-
stant currency information” section starting on page 28.

OPERATING INCOME

Operating income is the most appropriate measure for
evaluating the profitability of the operating segments
and is therefore also a key performance indicator.

OPERATING INCOME MARGIN

Operating income margin represents the ratio of oper-
ating income to revenue. We believe operating in-
come margin shows the profitability of each of our
operating segments or the Group as a whole.

DELIVERED EBIT
(NON-IFRS MEASURE)

As a result of the significance of noncontrolling inter-
est holders in our operations, we believe a measure
that is meaningful to investors is operating income
less noncontrolling interests (Delivered eEBiT). Deliv-
ered EBIT approximates the operating income attrib-
utable to the shareholders of FMC AG&CO. KGAA. AS
such, we believe that operating income, or EBIT, is the
closest comparable IFRS measure.

Table 2.5 on page 25 Shows the reconciliation of
operating income to Delivered esit for our reporting
segments.


--- Page 8 ---

NET INCOME GROWTH
AT CONSTANT CURRENCY
(NON-IFRS MEASURE)

At Group level, percentage growth in net income
(net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG&
CO. KGAA) at constant currency is an additional key
performance indicator used for internal manage-
ment. Please see the “Constant currency information”
section starting on page 28 for more information on the
use and calculation of financial measures at constant
currency.

2.5 DELIVERED EBIT RECONCILIATION

BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE
GROWTH AT CONSTANT CURRENCY
(NON-IFRS MEASURE)

Percentage growth in basic earnings per share at
constant currency is a key performance indicator to
evaluate our profitability. This indicator helps to
manage our overall performance. Basic earnings
per share is calculated by dividing net income at-
tributable to shareholders by the weighted-average
number of outstanding shares over the course of
the year. Please see the “Constant currency infor-
mation” section starting on page 28 for more informa-
tion on the use and calculation of financial mea-
sures at constant currency.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

We manage our investments using a detailed coordi-
nation and evaluation process. The Management
Board sets the complete investment budget for the
Group as well as the investment targets. Before real-
izing specific investment projects or acquisitions, our
internal Acquisition & Investment Committee (Alc) ex-
amines the individual projects and measures, taking
into account the expected return on investment and
potential yield. Investment projects are evaluated us-
ing common methods such as net present value, in-
ternal interest rate methods and payback periods. We
utilize this evaluation methodology to ensure that we
only make and implement investments and acquisi-
tions that increase shareholder value. Capital expen-
ditures for property, plant and equipment is an indi-
cator used for internal management. It influences the
capital invested for replacement and expansion.

CASH FLOW MEASURES

Net cash provided by (used in)
operating activities in % of revenue
(Non-iFRS Measure)

Our consolidated statement of cash flows indicates
how we generated and used cash and cash equiva-
lents. In conjunction with our other primary financial
statements, it provides information that helps us eval-
uate changes to our net assets and our financial
structure (including liquidity and solvency). Net cash
provided by (used in) operating activities is applied
to assess whether a business can generate the cash
required to make the necessary replacement and ex-
pansion of investments. This indicator is impacted by
the profitability of our business and the development

of working capital, mainly receivables. Net cash pro-
vided by (used in) operating activities in percent of
revenue shows the percentage of our revenue that is
available in terms of financial resources. It is an indi-
cator for our operating financial strength.

Free cash flow in % of revenue
(Non-iFRS Measure)

Free cash flow (net cash provided by (used in) oper-
ating activities after capital expenditures, before ac-
quisitions and investments) refers to the cash flow we
have at our disposal. This indicator shows the per-
centage of revenue available for acquisitions and in-
vestments, dividends to shareholders, reducing debt
financing or for repurchasing shares.

Table 2.6 Shows the significant cash flow key per-
formance indicators for 2017 and 2016 and reconciles
free cash flow and free cash flow in percent of reve-
nue to net cash provided by (used in) operating activ-
ities and net cash provided by (used in) operating
activities in percent of revenue, respectively.

NET LEVERAGE RATIO
(NON-IFRS MEASURE)

The net leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of net
debt/esitDA, is a key performance indicator used for
internal management at Group level. In 2017, we re-
vised this indicator from leverage ratio to net leverage
ratio, which aligns to our covenant obligations under
our Amended 2012 Credit Agreement as well as de-
termines pricing under that agreement. see note 14 of
the notes to the consolidated financial statements for
more information on the Amended 2012 Credit Agree-
ment. To determine the net leverage ratio, debt less
cash and cash equivalents (net debt) is compared to

EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization; adjusted for acquisitions and dives-
titures made during the year with a purchase price
above a €50M threshold as defined in the Amended
2012 Credit Agreement, and non-cash charges). The
ratio is an indicator of the length of time the Compa-
ny needs to service the net debt out of its own re-
sources. We believe that the net leverage ratio pro-
vides more reliable information about the extent to
which we are able to meet our payment obligations
than considering only the absolute amount of our
debt. We have a strong market position in a growing,
global and mainly non-cyclical market. Furthermore,
most of our customers have a high credit rating as
the dialysis industry is characterized by stable and
sustained cash flows. This means that we can work
with a relatively large share of debt capital compared
with companies in other industries.

Table 2.7 shows the reconciliation of the net
leverage ratio at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL
(NON-IFRS MEASURE)

Return on invested capital (RoIc) is the ratio of oper-
ating income after tax (net operating profit after tax,
NoPAT) to the average invested capital of the last five
quarter closing dates, and expresses how efficiently
we allocate the capital under our control or how well
we employ our capital with regard to a specific in-
vestment project.

Table 2.9 on page 28 Shows the reconciliation of
average invested capital to total assets, which we
believe to be the most directly comparable irrs finan-
cial measure, and how roic is calculated.

Under IFRS, amounts received in local (non-euro)
currency are translated into euro at the average
exchange rate for the period presented. Once we
translate the local currency for the constant curren-
cy, we then calculate the change, as a percentage,
of the current period using the prior period ex-
change rates versus the prior period. This resulting
percentage is a Non-iFRs Measure referring to a
change as a percentage at constant currency. These
currency-adjusted financial measures are identi-
fiable by the designated terms “Constant Exchange
Rates” or “Constant Currency”.

We believe that the measures at Constant Cur-
rency (Non-IFRS measure) are useful to investors, lend-
ers, and other creditors because such information
enables them to gauge the impact of currency fluctu-
ations on our revenue, operating income, net income
attributable to shareholders of FMc AG & CO. KGAA and
other items from period to period. However, we lim-
it our use of Constant Currency period over period
changes to a measure for the impact of currency fluc-
tuations on the translation of local currency into euro.
We do not evaluate our results and performance
without considering both Constant Currency period
over period changes in Non-irrs revenue, operating
income, net income attributable to shareholders of
FMC AG&CO. KGAA and other items and changes in
revenue, operating income, net income attributable
to shareholders of FMc AG & CO. KGAA and other items
prepared in accordance with IFRs. We caution the
readers of this report to follow a similar approach by
considering data on Constant Currency period over
period changes only in addition to, and not as a sub-
stitute for or superior to, changes in revenue, oper-
ating income, net income attributable to sharehold-
ers of FMC AG&CO. KGAA and other items prepared in
accordance with IFRS. We present the growth rate

RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT

Developing innovative products and continuously im-
proving our dialysis treatments are an inherent part
of our growth strategy. Our worldwide research and
development (R&D) activities, which are centrally
managed by the Global Research & Development di-
vision (GRD), enable us to develop products efficient-
ly and to systematically promote the exchange of
knowledge and technology between regions.

GLOBAL RESEARCH &
DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

Health care systems face major financial challenges
now and in the long term. With regard to our re-
search and development activities, this confirms our
intention to develop innovative products that are not
only of high-quality, but are also affordable. Based on
our experience in operating our own dialysis clinics,
we do not consider these to be incompatible aims.

Our R&D strategy is globally oriented. This en-
ables us to respond even better to the worldwide rise
in demand for high-quality yet cost-efficient treat-
ment methods. In doing so, we also take regional
market conditions into account and offer a differen-
tiated product range. In future, we intend to deliver
innovative, competitive products even more effi-
ciently and strengthen our focus on developing
countries.

In addition to R&D activities carried out at our
company, we collaborate with external partners with
the aim of building a comprehensive innovation and
technology network. These include numerous aca-
demic institutions, such as research institutes at re-
nowned universities in the u.s. Another partner is the
Renal Research Institute (RRI) in New York. This sub-
sidiary of Fresenius Medical Care North America is a
leading institution in the field of clinical research into
chronic kidney failure. Together we are working on
fundamental issues relating to dialysis treatment. We
are increasingly collaborating with start-ups to en-
courage an open culture that promotes innovation
and to gain access to the latest technologies both in
our core business as well as in adjacent areas that are
of future strategic interest to us.

R&D RESOURCES

In the past financial year, Fresenius Medical Care
spent a total of around €131M on research and devel-
opment (2016: €147 M). R&D expenditure corresponded
to around 4% (2016: 5%) of our health care product
revenue. Around a quarter of our R&D expenditure
went into funding advance developments, laying the
foundation for future product innovations. At the end
of 2017, our patent portfolio comprised some 8,396
property rights in approximately 1,253 patent families,
i.e. groups of patents linked to the same invention.
Our R&D work in the financial year produced around
126 additional patent families. A broad portfolio of
patents will provide us with a wide range of treat-
ment options in this competitive area in future.

In 2017, 825 highly qualified employees (full-time
equivalents) worked for Fresenius Medical Care in R&D
worldwide (2016: 794). They come from various back-
grounds: Physicians work side by side with software
specialists, business economists and engineers in in-
terdisciplinary teams. Around 530 employees — the

majority of our R&D staff — are based in Europe. Most
activities are carried out at our facilities in Schweinfurt
and Bad Homburg v.d. Hohe (Germany). Other Red
sites are in St. Wendel (Germany), Bucharest (Romania)
and Krems (Austria). In the U.s. the Company main-
tains centers of excellence for the development of de-
vices in Concord (California) and for dialyzers and oth-
er disposable products in Ogden (Utah). Development
activities in Shanghai and Changshu (China) are fo-
cused on the growing demand for cost-effective dial-
ysis systems in Asia and emerging markets. The global
R&D organization coordinates collaboration and tech-
nology exchange among the various sites. As part of
our innovation culture, we also strive to carry out re-
search and development responsibly. More informa-
tion can be found in tables 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12.

EMPLOYEES

Fresenius Medical Care owes its business success to
the commitment of its employees. At functional level,
our personnel management is conducted globally to
ensure a uniform strategic approach in line with the
overriding corporate objectives.

As at December 31, 2017, Fresenius Medical
Care employed a total of 114,000 members of staff
(full-time equivalents) in 60 countries. Our work-
force therefore grew by 4%, or more than 4,600 in
absolute terms, compared to the previous year. This
was primarily due to organic growth in our business
and to acquisitions.

Table 2.13 on page 31 Shows the breakdown of em-
ployees by operating segment as well as offered ser-
vices and products.

Staff costs at Fresenius Medical Care rose to
€6,900M in 2017 (2016: €6,291M). This corresponds to
39% (2016: 38%) of revenue. Average staff costs per
employee (average full-time equivalents) stood at
€61,287 (2016: €58,596).

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2017

ECONOMIC REPORT

The dialysis market is a
sustainable growth market
with steadily rising demand
for products and services
to treat kidney patients.

MACROECONOMIC
AND SECTOR-SPECIFIC
ENVIRONMENT

MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
Dependency on economic cycles

Our business is exposed to economic cycles to a rel-
atively small extent only. This sets us apart from man-
ufacturers of consumer goods, for instance, whose
products are subject to more cyclical demand.

Our business is impacted more by government
reimbursement rates and remuneration systems. Dial-
ysis is a vital medical service, which is why it is usually
paid for by the responsible health care system.

Exchange rate developments

As Fresenius Medical Care operates worldwide, the
results of its operations are impacted by exchange
rate developments. Movements in the u.s. dollar and
the euro in relation to one another are especially cru-
cial as we generate a major part of our revenues in
the u.s. The euro remained constant in relation to the
u.s. dollar at the annual average rate in 2017.

In addition, Fresenius Medical Care’s operating
results are influenced by changes in the exchange
rate between the euro and local currencies, partly
due to large production sites in the eurozone selling
to Group companies with different functional curren-
cies, but also because the euro is the currency we use
for financial reporting. Regarding the sales within the
Group, individual subsidiaries are exposed to transac-
tional risks due to fluctuations in the rate of exchange
between the invoicing currencies and the currencies
in which they conduct their local operations. Fresenius
Medical Care reduces transaction risks, i.e. risks from
foreign currency exposures or exchange rate fluctua-
tions, through a global network of production facili-
ties, which is geared towards demand in the Compa-
ny’s dialysis product business. Often, the production
facilities are based in the markets they serve. There-
fore, costs are incurred in the same currency in which
Fresenius Medical Care generates revenue. The risk of
exchange rate fluctuations for health care services is
relatively low because services are provided locally
and are therefore invoiced in the respective currency.

SECTOR-SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT

Chronic kidney failure (End Stage Renal Disease, ESRD)
is a global disease. The number of patients requiring
renal replacement therapy is increasing worldwide:
At the end of 2017, approximately 3.9m patients un-
derwent dialysis treatment or received a donor organ.
More information can be found in table 2.14.

For many years now, the number of donated
organs worldwide has been significantly lower than
the number of patients on transplant waiting lists.
Despite extensive efforts by regional initiatives to
increase awareness of kidney donation and the will-
ingness to donate, the share of patients receiving
kidney transplantation compared with other treat-
ment methods has remained relatively unchanged
over the past ten years.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) 349,000 9%

Source: Company information and estimates


--- Page 16 ---

The prevalence of chronic kidney failure varies
between regions. There are several reasons for this:
> The countries differ demographically, as age
structures in the population vary worldwide.
> The prevalence of risk factors for kidney dis-
ease, such as diabetes and high blood pressure,
varies widely.

> The genetic predisposition for kidney disease
also differs significantly around the world.

> Access to dialysis is still restricted in many coun-
tries, meaning that many patients suffering
from kidney failure are not treated and there-
fore do not appear in prevalence statistics.

> Cultural factors such as nutrition play a role.

The number of dialysis patients rose by around 6%
in 2017. In the u.s., Japan, and Western and Central
Europe, patient growth was slower than in econom-
ically weaker regions, where it is generally above 6%.

Comparison of
dialysis treatment methods

In 2017, most dialysis patients have been treated in
one of the approximately 41,300 dialysis centers
worldwide, with an average of 75 patients per center.
However, this figure varies considerably from country
to country.

Hemodialysis is by far the most common form
of therapy for chronic kidney failure. A total of 89%
of dialysis patients have been treated with this ther-
apy 2017 — mostly in a dialysis center. Home hemodi-
alysis is an alternative to treatment in a dialysis center.
It is still rarely used. In the reporting period, 11% of
all dialysis patients were treated with peritoneal dialy-
sis, usually at home.

Volume of the dialysis market

According to our estimates, the volume of the global
dialysis market increased to around €70BN in 2017
(2016: €69 BN). The market grew by 4% over the past
year at Constant Currency. We expect the following
approximate breakdown for this market volume:
around €13 BN for dialysis products and approximate-
ly €57BN for dialysis services (including dialysis drugs).

Care Coordination

Chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular
diseases are becoming increasingly common and are
responsible for almost two out of three deaths world-
wide. In many countries, a large proportion of health
care spending goes toward treating chronic diseases.
To counteract the resultant increase in cost pressure,
more and more health care systems, such as that in our
largest market, the u.s., have started reimbursing co-
ordinated, holistic care rather than individual services.
As the range of services we offer in the area of
Care Coordination varies widely, we cannot provide
a meaningful estimate of the market volume. We cur-
rently offer medical services in Care Coordination
mainly in the u.s. and the Asia-Pacific Segment and
have adapted our activities to these markets. The ex-
tent to which our Care Coordination services are
rolled out outside the u.s. may vary in individual
countries and regions depending on the respective
reimbursement system and market environment.

Our customers are mostly
health insurers and companies

Fresenius Medical Care’s most important customers
are state-owned or public health insurers, private
health insurers, and companies. Approximately 34% of
the Company's consolidated revenues in 2017 were
attributable to u.s. federal health care benefit pro-
grams, such as Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement.

Health care and reimbursement
systems vary from country to country

As renal replacement therapy is a life-saving medical
service, patients often do not have to pay for dialysis
themselves. Instead, the costs are borne by the re-
sponsible health care system. The reimbursement
systems for dialysis treatment — in other words, the
structures used by health care systems to reimburse
dialysis services — differ from country to country and
sometimes even within countries. The business activ-
ities and reimbursement of dialysis therapy are affect-
ed by various factors including regional conditions,
the treatment method, regulatory issues, and the
type of dialysis service provider (public or private).

Our ability to influence the reimbursement of
our services is limited.

ECONOMIC REPORT

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2017

ECONOMIC REPORT

34

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2017

The reimbursement system in the u.s.

The environment for reimbursement and ancillary ser-
vices significantly influences our business. In the u.s.
— currently our biggest market — most of our patients
are covered by the governmental health authority,
called Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (cms),
which pays for treatment. It also determines the re-
imbursement rates for its patients (Medicare/Medic-
aid patients). Due to pressure to reduce health care
costs, increases in the reimbursement rate by the u.s.
government have been limited in the past. As a con-
sequence, the reimbursement rate in cms’ prospective
payment system (Pps) for ESRD treatments (so-called
ESRD PPS rate) has not changed material year-on-year.
The ESRD PPS rate for 2017 was $231.55, just 0.5% above
the 2016 base rate of $230.39. For 2018 the ESRD PPS
rate is $232.37 which represents a 0.3% increase from
the 2017 base rate including the adjustment for the
wage index budget-neutrality factor. There is uncer-
tainty regarding possible future changes in health
care regulation in the u.s., including the regulation
of reimbursement for dialysis services. Any significant
reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates could
have a material adverse effect on our health care
services business. As demand for dialysis products is
affected by Medicare reimbursement, this could have
an impact on our product business, too. To the extent
that inflation, triggered for example by labor and sup-
ply costs resulting in higher operating costs, is not
fully compensated by an increase in reimbursement
rates, our business and results of operations may also
be adversely affected. More information can be found
in the “Results of operations, financial position and
net assets” section starting on page 38.

In the u.s., reimbursement by government in-
stitutions is lower than reimbursement by private
insurers and managed care organizations. The pay-
ments we receive from private insurers generate a
substantial portion of the profits we report. In 2017,
35% of the health care revenue of the Group was
related to private insurers in the North America Seg-
ment. Our business is therefore influenced by a
change in the share of reimbursements by private
insurers in the u.s. A decrease in these payments
would have a negative impact on our results of oper-
ations, cash flow and earnings.

Quality-based reimbursement
The health care debate in some countries is currently
focused on establishing reimbursement structures
based on treatment quality (pay for performance).
In this case, more responsibility is transferred to the
medical service provider. The goal of reimbursement
models of this kind is to maintain a high-quality of
care combined with lower overall costs for the health
care system.

The reimbursement system in the u.s. is also an
example of a model based on qualitative criteria. The
ESRD PPS rate in the u.s. is influenced by our estab-
lished quality management system. We manage the
impact of the EsRD pps with three broad measures:
> We work with medical directors and physicians

to find efficiencies that are consistent with the
ESRD PPS's quality incentive program (qiP) and
good clinical practices.
> We negotiate cost savings through pharma-
ceutical acquisitions.

> We achieve greater efficiencies and better
patient outcomes by introducing new initiatives
to improve patient care at the start of dialysis.

The ESRD pPS's QiP has affected payments since Janu-
ary 1, 2012. Dialysis facilities that do not achieve es-
tablished quality standards receive reduced payments
by up to 2% for a particular year, based on their year-
on-year performance. CMs updates the set of quality
measures each year, adding, revising or withdrawing
measures. The Qip payment adjustment for 2017 takes
into account the performance of each facility in 2015
based on a set of measures with a focus on:
> anemia management,
> dialysis adequacy,
> reporting dialysis events to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (cbc),
> administration of patient satisfaction surveys
and
> reporting mineral metabolism on a monthly
basis.

Reimbursement in

Care Coordination in the u.s.
We are also working closely with cms in the area of
reimbursement for Care Coordination. For example,
our subsidiary Sound Physicians has participated in the
Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPC!) initia-
tive since April 2015. BPci is a pilot initiative, extended
through September 30, 2018, that offers bundled pay-
ments for individual services, including acute inpatient
hospital services, physician services, and post-acute


--- Page 18 ---

services. They are granted to Medicare beneficiaries
in the course of a single episode of an illness or
course of treatment. As a participant in this project,
we can be entitled to additional reimbursement if we
provide high-quality care at a cost that is below a set
threshold. In January 2018, cms announced the launch
of a new bundled payment model named Bundled
Payments for Care Improvement Advanced (sPci Ad-
vanced). Bpci Advanced starts on October 1, 2018 and
continues to December 31, 2023. Under pci Advanced,
participants can earn additional payment if expendi-
tures for a beneficiary's episode of care do not exceed
spending targets which includes measures for quality.

In addition, we participate in cms’s Compre-
hensive ESRD Care Model (cec Model) through ESRD
Seamless Care Organizations (EScOS) since October 1,
2015, which also has an impact on reimbursement.
The aim of the cec Model is to deliver better health
outcomes for ESRD patients while cutting costs for
Medicare. Escos that achieve the minimum quality
thresholds specified by the program and generate re-
ductions in the cost of care above certain thresholds
for ESRD patients covered by the model receive a por-
tion of the cost savings. Our Escos also share in the
risk of cost increases and are obligated to reimburse
part of any such increases to cms if the actual costs
exceed these thresholds. As of January 1, 2018, the
existing 24 EScos expanded by adding new physician
practice partners and dialysis facilities, growing the
number of patients participating from approximately
26,000 in 2017 to 41,000 in 2018.

In November 2017, we announced the results
from the first performance year from our Escos. The
results, which cover the period from October 2015
through December 2016, show improved health out-
comes for patients receiving care coordination
through the escos. This success was validated by an
independent report, which showed a nearly 9% de-
crease in hospitalization rates for these patients
during the same time. As a result, the Company's
EScCOS together generated more than $43™m in gross
savings, an average 5.47% reduction in expenditures
per patient, with all six of its first-year Escos exceed-
ing the shared savings benchmark.

Furthermore, we have entered into various ar-
rangements with both government and private sec-
tor health care insurers, in which we assume the risk
for the overall care of certain ESRD patients in ex-
change for set payments. We have been operating
the Medicare Advantage esrb Chronic Special Needs
Plan (MA-CSNP) in five U.S. states since January 1, 2017.
MA-CSNPS are Medicare Advantage health plans

offered by private companies that have contracts
with Medicare to provide patients with Medicare ben-
efits. Enrollment in these plans is limited to individuals
with specific severe or disabling chronic conditions,
such as ESRD. Our MA-CSNPS provide services, includ-
ing Care Coordination services, and receive capitated
payments from Medicare for taking care of enrolled
ESRD patients.

We also participate in sub-capitation with com-
mercial insurers as well as in other shared savings and
risk arrangements with certain Medicare Advantage
plans, Accountable Care Organizations (Acos) and
other integrated care organizations.

OVERALL BUSINESS
DEVELOPMENT

HIGHLIGHTS
Optimizing Care Coordination

In implementing our investment strategy, we contin-
ue to address activities aimed at a holistic, coordi-
nated care approach in 2017. In this context, Fresenius
Medical Care acquired a majority stake in Cura Group,
a leading operator of day hospitals in Australia. Cura
runs 19 private day hospitals across Australia, where
it provides a variety of specialized outpatient ser-
vices, such as ophthalmology and orthopedic surgery.
This step allows Fresenius Medical Care to further
leverage its core competence in operating outpatient
facilities, extend its dialysis network, and in doing so
lay the foundation for future growth in the Austra-
lian market.

In line with our strategic goal to further opti-
mize the Company's Care Coordination portfolio,
Fresenius Medical Care divested Shiel Medical Labo-
ratory to Quest Diagnostics. Shiel provides non-dial-
ysis laboratory services in the New York City and New
Jersey metropolitan area. Fresenius Medical Care’s
dialysis-related laboratory services business, Spectra
Labs, is not affected by the divestiture.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2017

Financing

We refinanced our existing senior secured credit
agreement, originally due to mature in 2019, ahead of
schedule. The amended agreement now reflects a
simplified, unsecured structure consistent with our
investment grade rating and lower tiered pricing. It
has an aggregate amount of approximately $3.9 BN
and consists of revolving facilities and term loans, de-
nominated in both u.s. dollar and euro, with matur-
ities in 2020 and 2022.

Agreement with the United States
Departments of Veterans Affairs
and Justice

On January 31, 2017, the Company announced an
agreement with the United States Departments of
Veterans Affairs and Justice resolving litigation com-
menced in 2014 regarding reimbursement for services
provided to veterans by the Company's clinics during
the period January 2009 through February 15, 2011
(vA Agreement). The agreement led to increase the
Company's recognition of revenue in 2017 by approx-
imately €94M. The positive impact on the Company’s
net income (net income attributable to shareholders
of FMC AG & CO. KGAA) was approximately €51M.

Natural disasters

In the second half of 2017, our business in the North
America Segment was influenced by the hurricanes
Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as an earthquake in
Mexico. The costs related to these natural disasters
net of anticipated recoveries (Natural Disaster Costs)
had a negative impact on our operating income in the
amount of €18M. Net income decreased by €11M.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
related charge

The Company recorded a provision of €200M in re-
gards to Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) investi-
gations. The provision is based on the ongoing settle-
ment negotiations that would avoid litigation between
the Company and the u.s. Securities and Exchange
Commission (sec) and the u.s. Department of Justice
(DOJ) (government agencies) and represents an esti-
mate from the range of potential outcomes estimated
from current discussions. FcPA Related Charge encom-
passes government agencies’ claims for profit dis-
gorgement, as well as accruals for fines and penalties,
certain legal expenses and other related costs or asset
impairments (FcPA Related Charge). For further infor-
mation on these investigations, see note 22 of the notes
to the consolidated financial statements.

u.s. tax reform

As a result of the u.s. tax reform effective since Jan-
uary 1, 2018, the corporate income tax rate in the u.s.
decreased from 35% to 21%. Due to the new law,
Fresenius Medical Care remeasured its deferred tax
balances. This resulted in a deferred tax benefit of
€236M for 2017, which increased net income accord-
ingly in 2017.

Acquisitions and divestitures

To strengthen our vertically integrated dialysis busi-
ness, Fresenius Medical Care signed an agreement to
acquire NxStage Medical, Inc. (NxStage), a U.s.-based
medical technology and service company. NxStage
develops, produces and markets medical devices for
use in home dialysis and in the critical care setting.
This acquisition enables Fresenius Medical Care to
further leverage manufacturing, supply chain and
marketing competencies across the dialysis products,
services and Care Coordination businesses in a care
setting that requires less labor and capital.

Fresenius Medical Care intends to acquire all
outstanding shares of NxStage for $30 per common
share. As a result, the transaction would be valued at
approximately $2BN. The merger is subject to addi-
tional regulatory approvals and other customary clos-
ing conditions.

COMPARISON OF
ACTUAL BUSINESS RESULTS
WITH THE OUTLOOK

The environment for our core business of dialysis re-
mained largely stable in 2017. We met the outlook we
set ourselves for the financial year 2017 to a great
extent.

Our 2017 outlook did not include the effects re-
lated to the va Agreement, the effects of Natural
Disaster Costs, the impact of the Fcpa Related Charge
and the effects of the u.s. tax reform. We have there-
fore adjusted the actual results for 2017 accordingly
to make them comparable with the 2017 outlook. For
a reconciliation of results 2017 to results 2017 adjusted
please see table 2.15 on page 37.

The outlook for the 2017 financial year was
based on the prevailing exchange rates at the begin-
ning of the year 2017. We expected revenue growth
of 8 to 10% at Constant Currency. We generated rev-
enue of €17.8BN. Excluding contributions from the vA
Agreement we generated revenue of €17.7BN, up 7%
on the previous year. Revenue excluding contribu-
tions from the va Agreement increased by 9% at Con-
stant Currency. We therefore met our expectations.


--- Page 20 ---

All operating segments, but above all the North
America Segment and the Asia-Pacific Segment, con-
tributed to the expansion of our business. Further
details on the development of revenue can be found
in the “Results of operation, financial position and net
assets” section starting on page 38.

We expected the growth of our operating in-
come to exceed that of revenue in the 2017 financial
year, or at least reach the same level. The operating
income for 2017 was €2.4BN. Adjusted for the vA
Agreement, Natural Disaster Costs and the impact of
the FcPA Related Charge the operating income for
2017 was up by 5% at Constant Currency to €2.5 BN.
We were below our expectations mainly due to high-
er than expected personnel and supply expenses in
the North America Segment as well as cost of acqui-
sitions for the acquisition of NxStage that were not
included in the outlook.

We expected Delivered EBIT to perform similar
to revenue in 2017. Delivered esit for 2017 was €2.1BN.
Adjusted for the va Agreement, the Natural Disaster
Costs and the impact of the FcpA Related Charge the
Delivered esit for 2017 increased by 6% at Constant
Currency to €2.2 BN. We also did not meet this expec-
tation mainly due to higher than expected personnel
and supply expenses in the North America Segment
as well as cost of acquisitions for the acquisition of
NxStage that were not included in the outlook.

At the beginning of the year, we set a target
range for net income growth of 7 to 9% at Constant
Currency for the 2017 financial year. The effects relat-
ed to the vA Agreement, the Natural Disaster Costs,
the impact of the Fcpa Related Charge and the effects
of the u.s. Tax Reform have not been included in this
range. Adjusted net income for 2017 increased by 7%
at Constant Currency to €1.2BN, which is within the
range of our expectations.

Adjusted earnings per share increased by 7% at
Constant Currency. This increase is in line with the
development of net income, as we expected.

We earmarked €1.1BN to €1.2BN for capital ex-
penditures. During 2017 we adjusted this expectation
to €0.9BN. With an outlay of €0.8BN, we almost re-
mained within our outlook. We expected to spend

around €0.75 BN on acquisitions and investments. This
number was adjusted during the year to €0.6BN. The
actual figure was €0.6 BN with respect to acquisitions
and investments and we therefore met our expecta-
tions. For further information, see the “Results of
operation, financial position and net assets” section
starting on page 38.

Driven by earnings development and good de-
velopment in Days Sales Outstanding, net cash pro-
vided by (used in) operating activities in percent of
revenue was high at 12.3%, meeting our expectation
of greater than 10%.

Free cash flow in percent of revenue was 7.6%
in 2017, which is also in line with our expectation of
greater than 4%.

According to our forecast, the leverage ratio
should have been below 2.5 at the end of 2017. The
actual leverage ratio was down to 2.4 at the balance
sheet date and is therefore as expected.

On Group level the Roic increased to 8.6% thus
meeting our expectation of at least 8.0%.

The number of employees at Fresenius Medical
Care (full-time equivalents) grew from 109,319 at the
end of 2016 to 114,000 at the end of 2017 due to organ-
ic growth and acquisitions. We therefore were below
our forecast of more than 117,000.

Research and development expenditures aimed
at boosting Fresenius Medical Care’s ability to adapt
to future requirements amounted to €131M, so that
we did not achieve our expected range of €150M to
€160M. Our research and development activities are
focused on further developing existing product
groups.

our outlook for 2017.

RESULTS OF OPERA-
TIONS, FINANCIAL
POSITION AND NET
ASSETS

The following sections summarize our results of op-
erations, financial position and net assets as well as
key performance indicators by reporting segment, as
well as Corporate, for the periods indicated.

We prepared the information using a manage-
ment approach, consistent with the manner in which
management internally disaggregates financial infor-
mation to assist in making internal operating deci-
sions and evaluating management performance.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Information about our segment data can be found in
table 2.17 on page 39.

Revenue and operating income generated in
countries outside the eurozone are subject to curren-
cy fluctuations. The twelve months ended Decem-
ber 31, 2017 and 2016 were negatively impacted by the
development of the euro against the u.s. dollar. For
the respective twelve-month period ended Decem-
ber 31, 2017 approximately 72% of revenue and ap-
proximately 88% of operating income were gener-
ated in u.s. dollars.

Consolidated financial statements

Information about our key indicators for the consol-
idated financial statements can be found in table 2.18
on page 40.

Health care services revenue increased by 8%
including a 2% negative impact from foreign curren-
cy translation. At Constant Exchange Rates, health
care services revenue increased by 10% driven by in-
creases in organic revenue per treatment (4%),
growth in same market treatments (3%) and contri-
butions from acquisitions (3%).

Dialysis treatments increased by 4% as a result
of growth in same market treatments (3%) and con-
tributions from acquisitions (2%), partially offset by
the effect of closed or sold clinics (1%).

At December 31, 2017, we owned, operated or
managed (excluding those managed but not consol-
idated in the u.s.) 3,752 dialysis clinics compared to
3,624 dialysis clinics at December 31, 2016. For the year
ended December 31, 2017, we acquired 67 dialysis clin-
ics, opened 109 dialysis clinics and combined or closed
48 clinics. The number of patients treated in dialysis
clinics that we own, operate or manage (excluding
patients of dialysis clinics managed but not consoli-
dated in the u.s.) increased by 4% to 320,960 at De-
cember 31, 2017 from 308,471 at December 31, 2016.

Health care product revenue increased by 6%
including a 1% negative impact from foreign currency
translation. At Constant Exchange Rates, health care
product revenue increased by 7%. Dialysis product

revenue increased by 5% including a 1% negative im-
pact from foreign currency translation. At Constant
Exchange Rates, dialysis product revenues increased
by 6% due to higher sales of dialyzers, machines,
peritoneal dialysis products, renal pharmaceuticals,
products for acute care treatments, hemodialysis
solutions and concentrates and bloodlines. Non-di-
alysis product revenue increased by 59% to €79M
from €49Mm with no foreign currency translation ef-
fects. The increase of 59% was due to the acquisition
of Xenios AG (Xenios).

The decrease period over period in the gross
profit margin was 0.1 percentage points. Foreign cur-
rency translation effects represented a 0.1 percentage
point increase in the gross profit margin. The de-
crease primarily reflects a decrease in the EMEA Seg-
ment, the Asia-Pacific Segment and Corporate, par-
tially offset by an increase in the North America
Segment. The gross profit margin decrease in the
EMEA Segment was primarily driven by unfavorable
impacts from acquisitions largely due to the develop-
ment of cardiopulmonary products at Xenios, pres-
sure on reimbursement in some countries and the
impact from two fewer dialysis days, partially offset
by a favorable impact from manufacturing. The gross
profit margin decrease in the Asia-Pacific Segment

2.17 SEGMENT DATA (INCLUDING CORPORATE)

was primarily driven by an unfavorable mix effect
related to acquisitions with lower margins and unfa-
vorable foreign currency transaction effects, partially
offset by a favorable impact from business growth,
mainly in China. The gross profit margin decrease in
Corporate was mainly driven by sustaining engineer-
ing costs. The increase in gross profit margin in the
North America Segment was primarily due to a favor-
able impact driven by the initial recognition in the
calendar year 2017 of earnings (including earnings
from prior periods) from the spc! initiative combined
with increased volumes for hospital-related physician
services, impact of revenue recognized from the vA
Agreement, lower costs for health care supplies and
a favorable impact from the increase in the ESRD PPS
rate for 2017, partially offset by higher costs in our
pharmacy services business, higher personnel ex-
pense and the impact from lower revenue for vascu-
lar services.

The increase period over period in selling, gen-
eral and administrative (sc & A) expenses as a percent-
age of revenue was 1.3 percentage points with virtu-
ally no impact from foreign currency translation in the
current period. The increase was driven by increases
at Corporate as well as in the EMEA Segment, the

Segment, partially offset by a decrease in the Asia-
Pacific Segment and a favorable impact of varying mar-
gins across our four reporting segments. The increase
at Corporate was mainly driven by the Fcpa Related
Charge in the amount of €200. The increase in the
EMEA Segment was due to unfavorable foreign cur-
rency transaction effects, unfavorable impacts from
acquisitions largely due to the development of car-
diopulmonary products at Xenios, higher overhead
costs and costs related to a change in the Manage-
ment Board, partially offset by decreased bad debt
expense and a favorable impact from a legal settle-
ment in Germany. The increase in the Latin America
Segment was due to unfavorable foreign currency
transaction effects and higher overhead costs, par-
tially offset by reimbursement rate increases which
mitigated inflationary cost increases in the region.
The increase in the North America Segment was
mainly driven by higher bad debt expense, higher
personnel expense and the impact from lower reve-
nue for vascular services, partially offset by gains on
the sale of fixed assets and investments, the impact
from higher revenue including the initial recognition
in the calendar year 2017 of earnings (including earn-
ings from prior periods) from the BPcI initiative com-
bined with increased volumes for hospital-related
physician services and a positive impact from income
attributable to a consent agreement on certain phar-
maceuticals. The decrease in the Asia-Pacific Segment

was due to a favorable impact from acquisitions
largely due to Cura and the prior year impact from
costs associated with changes in the Management
Board.

Research and development expenses decreased
by 11% to €131M from €147M. The decrease period
over period, as a percentage of revenue, was 0.2 per-
centage points, largely driven by capitalized develop-
ment costs, partially offset by expenses incurred re-
lated to the development of cardiopulmonary
products at Xenios and an increased project portfolio.

Income from equity method investees increased
by 15% to €67M from €59M. The increase was driven
by increased income from Vifor Fresenius Medical
Care Renal Pharma Ltd., an entity in which we have
ownership of 45%, due to increased sales in North
America, partially offset by increased costs to support
the launch and development of new projects.

The decrease period over period operating in-
come margin was 1.2 percentage points with virtually
no impact from foreign currency translation in the
current period. Operating income margin decreased
as a result of increased sG&A, as a percentage of
revenue and decreased gross profit margin, partially
offset by decreased research and development ex-
penses, as a percentage of revenue, and increased
income from equity method investees, as discussed
above. Excluding (1) the impact of the Fcpa Related
Charge of €200M, (iI) the effect of the va Agreement

of approximately €87m as of December 31, 2017 and
(ll) Natural Disaster Costs of approximately €18 M, op-
erating income margin decreased by 0.4 percentage
points to 14.1% from 14.5% with virtually no impact
from foreign currency translation in the current period.

Delivered epit decreased by 2% including a 2%
negative impact from foreign currency translation. At
Constant Exchange Rates, Delivered eit remained flat
largely a result of operating income at Constant Ex-
change Rates remaining stable.

Net interest expense decreased by 3% to €354M
from €366M. Foreign currency translation had a pos-
itive impact of 1% in the current period. At Constant
Exchange Rates, net interest expense decreased by
2% largely due to the replacement of interest bearing
Bonds, repaid in 2016 and 2017, by debt instruments
at lower interest rates.

Income tax expense decreased by 27% to €454M
from €623M. The effective tax rate decreased to
22.6% from 30.5% for the same period of 2016 driven
by the impact, €236M, of U.s. Tax Reform. Excluding
u.s. Tax Reform impacts, the effective tax rate in-
creased to 34.3% from 30.5% largely due to the FcPA
Related Charge of €200 mM which was not tax effected,
prior year related taxes, a lower portion of tax-free
income attributable to noncontrolling interests com-
pared to income before taxes and higher tax expense
related to the va Agreement, approximately €34M, as
the tax rate in the u.s. is higher than the average tax
rate outside of the U.s., partially offset by tax benefits
from financing structures. Excluding (1) the effect on
earnings before taxes due to the Fcpa Related Charge
of €200M, (II) the impact from the va Agreement, pre-
tax of approximately €87M, (tax expense of approxi-
mately €34™m), (Ill) the tax effects associated with
Natural Disaster Costs, pre-tax of approximately €18M
(tax expense of approximately €7m) and (Iv) U.S. Tax
Reform of approximately €236m, the effective tax
rate increased to 31.0% from 30.5%.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling inter-
ests decreased slightly to €274m from €276mM includ-
ing a 2% negative impact from foreign currency trans-
lation. At Constant Exchange Rates, net income
attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by
2% primarily driven by the portion of the va Agree-
ment reimbursement of approximately €2M attribut-
able to noncontrolling interests and increased non-
controlling interest expense related to Care
Coordination, partially offset by decreased noncon-
trolling interest expense related to dialysis in the
North America Segment driven by lower operating
income in less than wholly-owned clinics.

Net income attributable to shareholders of
FMC AG&CO. KGAA increased by 12% to €1,280M from
€1,144M including a 2% negative impact resulting from
foreign currency translation. At Constant Exchange
Rates, the increase of 14% was driven by the com-
bined effects of the items discussed above. Excluding
(1) the impact from the Fcpa Related Charge of €200M,
(il) the impact of the va Agreement of approximately
€51M, after tax, (III) Natural Disaster Costs of approx-
imately €11M, and (Iv) U.S. Tax Reform of approxi-
mately €236 M, net income attributable to sharehold-
ers of FMC AG&CO. KGAA increased by 5% including a
2% negative impact resulting from foreign currency
translation. At Constant Exchange Rates, excluding
the effects noted above, net income attributable to
shareholders of FMC AG&CO. KGAA increased by 7%.

Basic earnings per share increased by 12% in-
cluding a 2% negative impact from foreign currency
translation. At Constant Exchange Rates, basic earn-
ings per share increased by 14% primarily due to the
increase in net income attributable to shareholders
of FMC AG&CO. KGAA described above. The average
weighted number of shares outstanding for the peri-
od was approximately 306.6 M in 2017 (2016: 305.7M).

We employed 114,000 people (full-time equiva-
lents) as of December 31, 2017 compared to 109,319 as
of December 31, 2016, an increase of 4%, primarily due
to organic growth in our business and acquisitions.

ica Segment, the EMEA Segment, the Asia-Pacific
Segment and the Latin America Segment as well as
the measures we use to manage these segments.
Starting in the fiscal year 2017 these measures are
based on Irrs. In previous years U.S. GAAP-based fig-
ures were used to manage the segments. Thus, the
segment information was presented in accordance
with U.s. GAAP. To conform to the current year’s pre-
sentation, the previous year’s values are adjusted
accordingly.

In regards to our Care Coordination services we
use additional business metrics, which will be defined
below.

Business metrics for Care Coordination
The measures for the North America Segment and the
Asia-Pacific Segment discussed below include current
and future programs that we will be participating in
and will be reflected in the discussion of our business.
Currently, in our North America Segment, sub-capita-
tion, BPCI, ESCO programs, MA-CSNPS and other shared
savings programs are included within the member
months and medical cost under management calcu-
lations below. In the future, other programs may be
included in the metrics below. Note that due to the
timing required by cms to review the BPci and Esco
program data that we provide, estimates have been
used in order to report these metrics in a timely man-
ner. The Asia-Pacific Segment Care Coordination met-
ric currently used for discussion purposes is patient
encounters. These metrics may be developed further
in future periods.

These metrics are neither IFRS measures nor
Nnon-lFRS measures, and are therefore not accompa-
nied by or reconciled to IFRS measures.

Member months

under medical cost management
In our North America Segment, member months un-
der medical cost management is calculated by multi-
plying the number of members included in val-
ue-based reimbursement programs, such as Medicare
Advantage plans or other value-based programs in
the u.s., by the corresponding number of months
these members participate in those programs (Mem-
ber Months). In the aforementioned programs, we
assume the risk of generating savings. The financial
results are recorded in earnings as our performance
is determined. The membership offerings within Care
Coordination are sub-capitation arrangements,
MA-CSNPS, ESCO and BPCI programs as well as other
shared savings programs. An increase in patient
membership may indicate future earnings or losses as
our performance is determined through these man-
aged care programs.

Medical cost under management

In our North America Segment, medical cost under
management represents the management of medical
costs associated with our patient membership in val-
ue-based programs. For Esco, BPci and other shared
savings programs, this is calculated by multiplying the
Member Months in each program by the benchmark
of expected medical costs per member per month.
The sub-capitation and MA-csnps calculation multi-
plies the premium per member of the program per
month by the number of member months associated
with the plan, as noted above.

Care Coordination patient encounters

Care Coordination patient encounters represents the
total patient encounters and procedures conducted
by certain of our Care Coordination activities and, we
believe, is an indicator of the revenue generated.
Care Coordination patient encounters in the North
America Segment is the sum of all encounters and
procedures completed during the period by Sound,
MedSpring Urgent Care Centers, Azura Vascular Care,
and National Cardiovascular Partners, the trade name
of Laurus Healthcare L.p., as well as patients in our
Fresenius Medical Care Rx Bone Mineral Metabolism
(RX BMM) program. Care Coordination patient en-
counters in the Asia-Pacific Segment is the sum of all
encounters for the following services: ambulant
treatment services in day care hospitals, comprehen-
sive and specialized health check-ups, inpatient and
outpatient services, vascular access and other chronic
treatment services.

rics for the North America Segment can be found in

Dialysis

Revenue
Dialysis care revenue increased by 3% to €9,227M
from €8,975M including a 2% negative impact result-
ing from foreign currency translation. At Constant
Exchange Rates, dialysis care revenue increased by 5%
mainly due to same market treatment growth (2%),
an increase related to the vA Agreement, approxi-
mately €94M as of December 31, 2017 (1%), increases
in organic revenue per treatment (1%) and contribu-
tions from acquisitions (1%).

Dialysis treatments increased by 3% primarily
due to same market treatment growth (2%) and con-
tributions from acquisitions (1%). At December 31,
2017, 197,356 patients (4% increase from December 31,
2016) were being treated in the 2,393 dialysis clinics
that we own or operate in the North America Seg-
ment, compared to 188,987 patients treated in 2,306
dialysis clinics at December 31, 2016.

In the u.s., the average revenue per treatment,
excluding the va Agreement of approximately $4 per
treatment, increased to $353 (€319 at Constant Ex-
change Rates) from $351 (€318). The increase was
mainly attributable to a favorable impact from the
increase in the ESRD PPS rate for 2017.

Cost per treatment in the u.s. excluding Natural
Disaster Costs of $0.70 per treatment, increased to
$282 (€255 at Constant Exchange Rates) from $278
(€251). This increase was largely driven by higher per-
sonnel expense, higher bad debt expense as well as
increased property and other occupancy related costs
including depreciation, partially offset by decreased
costs for health care supplies and a gain from the sale
of fixed assets.

Health care product revenue increased by 3%
including a 2% negative impact resulting from foreign
currency translation. At Constant Exchange Rates,
health care product revenue increased by 5% was
driven by higher sales of renal pharmaceuticals, peri-
toneal dialysis products, hemodialysis solutions and
concentrates, machines and dialyzers.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2017

Operating income margin

The increase period over period in the dialysis oper-
ating income margin was 0.1 percentage points with
virtually no impact from foreign currency translation
in the current period. The increase was largely driven
by the vA Agreement, approximately €94™, a favor-
able impact from the increase in the ESRD pps rate for
2017, lower costs for health care supplies, gains from
the sale of fixed assets and investments as well as a
positive impact from income attributable to a consent
agreement on certain pharmaceuticals, partially off-
set by higher personnel expense, higher bad debt
expense and higher costs such as other supplies and
rent expense. Excluding (1) the va Agreement impact
of approximately €94 mM and (11) Natural Disaster Costs
of approximately €17M, operating income margin de-
creased by 0.5 percentage points to 18.7% from 19.2%
in the prior period with virtually no impact from for-
eign currency translation.

Delivered EBIT
Dialysis Delivered esi increased by 4% including a 2%
negative impact resulting from foreign currency trans-
lation. At Constant Exchange Rates, dialysis Delivered
EBIT increased by 6% mainly as the result of increased
operating income coupled with decreased income
from noncontrolling interests.

Care Coordination

Revenue
Care Coordination revenue increased by 25% includ-
ing a 3% negative impact resulting from foreign cur-
rency translation. At Constant Exchange Rates, Care
Coordination revenue increased by 28% driven by
increases in organic revenue growth (21%) and con-
tributions from acquisitions (7%).

Operating income margin
The increase period over period in the Care Coordina-
tion operating income margin was 2.7 percentage
points with virtually no impact from foreign currency
translation in the current period. The increase was
mainly driven by the impact from higher revenue in-
cluding the initial recognition in the calendar year
2017 of earnings (including earnings from prior peri-
ods) from the BPcl initiative combined with increased
volumes for hospital related physician services, in-
creased earnings recognized related to Escos, a gain
from the sale of an investment as well as the impact

from the improved margin contribution for laborato-
ry services, partially offset by the impact from lower
revenue for vascular services, higher bad debt ex-
pense, increased costs for pharmacy services and the
change in fair value of subsidiary stock based com-
pensation.

Delivered eBit

Care Coordination Delivered eit increased by 264%
including a 7% negative impact resulting from foreign
currency translation. At Constant Exchange Rates,
Care Coordination Delivered esit increased by 271%
mainly a result of increased operating income, par-
tially offset by the corresponding increase in noncon-
trolling interest expense.

Care Coordination business metrics
The increase in member months under medical cost
management was primarily attributable to an in-
crease in our participation in Esco programs from 6 to
24 ESCOS in 2017 as well as the addition of new payor
shared savings and sub-capitation agreements, par-
tially offset by a decrease in BPcI due to our voluntary
elimination of certain non-performing risks from our
BPCI portfolio. see note 4 to the table 2.19 on page 43.

Care Coordination cost under management in-
creased by 57%, including a 3% negative impact from
foreign currency translation in the current period. At
Constant Exchange Rates, Care Coordination’s medical
cost under management increased by 60% primarily
due to an increase in our participation in Esco pro-
grams from 6 to 24 ESCOS in 2017 as well as the addition
of new payor shared savings and sub-capitation agree-
ments. see note 4 to the table 2.19 on page 43.

The increase in patient encounters was primar-
ily driven by increased encounters for hospital related
physician services. see note 4 to the table 2.19 on page 43.

EMEA Segment
Information about key indicators for the EMEA Seg-
ment can be found in table 2.20.

Revenue
In the EMEA Segment, health care service revenue in-
creased by 6% with virtually no impact from foreign
currency translation in the current period. The in-
crease was due to contributions from acquisitions
(4%) and same market treatment growth (4%), par-
tially offset by decreases in organic revenue growth
per treatment (2%).

Dialysis treatments increased by 5% mainly due
to same market treatment growth (4%), contributions
from acquisitions (3%), partially offset by the effect
of closed or sold clinics (1%) and a decrease in dialy-
sis days (1%). As of December 31, 2017, we had 62,490
patients (5% increase from December 31, 2016) being
treated at the 746 dialysis clinics that we own, operate
or manage in the EMEA Segment compared to 59,767
patients treated at 711 clinics at December 31, 2016.

Health care product revenue increased by 6%
with virtually no impact from foreign currency trans-
lation in the current period. Dialysis product revenue
increased by 3% including negative foreign currency
translation effects of 1%. At Constant Exchange Rates,
dialysis product revenue increased by 4% due to high-
er sales of peritoneal dialysis products, products for
acute care treatments, dialyzers and renal pharma-
ceuticals, partially offset by lower sales of hemodial-
ysis solutions and concentrates. Non-dialysis product
revenue increased by 59% to €79m from €49m with
virtually no foreign currency translation effects. The
increase of 59% was due to the acquisition of Xenios.

Operating income margin

The decrease period over period in the operating in-
come margin was 2.3 percentage points with virtual-
ly no impact from foreign currency translation in the
current period. The decrease was mainly due to un-
favorable impacts from acquisitions largely due to the
development of cardiopulmonary products at Xenios
and foreign currency transaction effects, higher over-
head costs, costs related to the change in the Man-
agement Board, pressure on reimbursement in some
countries as well as lower income from equity meth-
od investees as a result of increased costs to support
the launch and development of new projects, partial-
ly offset by decreased bad debt expense.

Delivered EBIT
Delivered EpiT decreased by 7% including a 1% nega-
tive impact resulting from foreign currency transla-
tion. At Constant Exchange Rates, Delivered EBiT de-
creased by 6% primarily due to decreased operating
income coupled with slightly increased income from
noncontrolling interests.

Asia-Pacific Segment
Information about key indicators and business met-
rics for the Asia-Pacific Segment can be found in
table 2.21.

Key indicators are now provided separately for
dialysis and Care Coordination in the Asia-Pacific Seg-
ment due to an acquisition in Australia during the
second quarter of 2017. Previously, there were imma-
terial amounts of services performed in Care Coordi-
nation within the Asia-Pacific Segment. We are pre-
senting our Care Coordination activities in
Asia-Pacific starting in 2017 as the data collected and
presented during the period is now reliable. For com-
parative purposes in our 2017 analysis, the Asia-Pacif-
ic Segment will be discussed on an overall segment
basis. Care Coordination services include ambulant
treatment services in day care hospitals where we
provide treatment infrastructure, comprehensive and
specialized health check-ups, inpatient and outpa-
tient services, vascular access and other chronic treat-
ment services.

Revenue
In the Asia-Pacific Segment, health care service rev-
enue increased by 13%, including a 3% negative

impact resulting from foreign currency translation. At
Constant Exchange Rates, health care service reve-
nue increased by 16% as a result of contributions
from acquisitions (12%), same market treatment
growth (3%) and increases in organic revenue growth
per treatment (2%), partially offset by the effect of
closed or sold clinics (1%).

Dialysis treatments increased by 6% mainly due
to contributions from acquisitions (4%) and same
market treatment growth (3%), partially offset by the
effect of closed or sold clinics (1%). As of Decem-
ber 31, 2017, we had 29,739 patients (1% increase from
December 31, 2016) being treated at the 3381 dialysis
clinics that we own, operate or manage in the
Asia-Pacific Segment compared to 29,328 patients
treated at 374 clinics at December 31, 2016.

Health care product revenue increased by 8%,
including a 2% negative impact resulting from foreign
currency translation. At Constant Exchange Rates,
health care product revenue increased by 10% as a
result of increased sales of dialyzers, machines,
bloodlines, peritoneal dialysis products and products
for acute care treatments.

Operating income margin

The decrease period over period in the operating
income margin was 0.3 percentage points. Foreign
currency translation had a positive impact of 0.1 per-
centage points. The decrease was largely due to un-
favorable impacts from foreign currency transaction
effects and an unfavorable mix effect related to ac-
quisitions with lower margins, partially offset by a
favorable impact from business growth, mainly in
China, and the prior year impact from costs associat-
ed with changes in the Management Board.

Delivered EBIT
Delivered eEsit increased by 8%, including a 2% nega-
tive impact resulting from foreign currency transla-
tion. At Constant Exchange Rates, Delivered eBiT in-
creased by 10% mainly due to increased operating
income at Constant Currency, partially offset by in-
creased income from noncontrolling interests.

Latin America Segment
Information about key indicators for the Latin America
Segment can be found in table 2.22.

Revenue

In the Latin America Segment, health care service
revenue increased by 11%, including a 5% negative
impact resulting from foreign currency translation.
At Constant Exchange Rates, health care service rev-
enue increased by 16% as a result of increases in
organic revenue per treatment (15%), contributions
from acquisitions (1%), and same market treatment
growth (1%), partially offset by the effect of closed
or sold clinics (1%).

Dialysis treatments increased by 2% mainly due
to contributions from acquisitions (2%) and same
market treatment growth (1%), partially offset by the
effect of closed or sold clinics (1%). As of Decem-
ber 31, 2017, we had 31,375 patients (3% increase from
December 31, 2016) being treated at the 232 dialysis
clinics that we own, operate or manage in the Latin
America Segment compared to 30,389 patients treat-
ed at 233 clinics at December 31, 2016.

Health care product revenue increased by 14%.
Foreign currency translation effects represented 3%
of the increase. At Constant Exchange Rates, health
care product revenue increased by 11% driven by high-
er sales of dialyzers, machines, hemodialysis solutions
and concentrates as well as bloodlines, partially off-
set by lower sales of peritoneal dialysis products.

Operating income margin

The decrease period over period in the operating in-
come margin was 1.1 percentage points, including a
negative foreign currency translation effect of 0.2 per-
centage points in the current period. The decrease
was mainly due to unfavorable foreign currency
transaction effects, higher overhead costs and in-
creased costs for manufacturing, partially offset by
reimbursement rate increases, which mitigated infla-
tionary cost increases in the region.

Delivered EBIT
Delivered epit decreased by 1%, including a 4% neg-
ative impact resulting from foreign currency transla-
tion. At Constant Exchange Rates, Delivered esit in-
creased by 3% due to increased operating income at
Constant Currency.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2017

FINANCIAL POSITION

Our investment and financing strategy did not change
substantially in the past financial year. One of the
reasons is our business model, which is based on sta-
ble and high cash flows, allowing a more consistent
and higher level of debt than might be the case in
other industries. We still regard our refinancing op-
tions as being very stable and flexible. During the
fiscal year, the focus of our investing activities was on
our health care services business.

Financial management
policies and goals

Besides optimizing our financial costs, financial flexi-
bility takes top priority within our financing strategy.
We ensure this flexibility by using a wide range of
financial instruments and securing a high level of di-
versification with regard to our investors and banks.
Our financing profile is characterized by a wide range
of maturities up to 2024.

The main financing instrument is the syndicated
credit agreement with revolving credit facilities as
well as long-term loans in u.s. dollar and euro. In
addition, we use other mid- and long-term financing
instruments, mainly bonds in u.s. dollar and euro,
and Convertible Bonds. Short-term financing needs
are covered by issuances under our commercial paper
program in euro and the Accounts Receivable Facility.

In our long-term financial planning, we focus
primarily on the net leverage ratio. At the end of 2017
and 2016, the net leverage ratio was 2.1 and 2.3, re-
spectively.

The key financial risks we are exposed to in-
clude are foreign exchange risks and interest rate
risks. In order to manage these risks, we enter into
various hedging transactions with banks that have
been authorized by the Management Board and
which generally have ratings in the “A” category or
better. We do not use financial instruments for

trading or other speculative purposes. For financial
risks, see the “Risks and opportunities report” starting
on page 59 and note 23 Of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.

Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA (Fresenius SE), under a
service agreement, conducts financial instrument ac-
tivity for us under the control of a single centralized
department. We have established guidelines for risk
management procedures and controls including the
use of financial instruments. These guidelines include
a clear segregation of duties with regards to execu-
tion on one side and administration, accounting and
controlling on the other.

We also utilize Fresenius se’s cash management
system for the settlement of certain intercompany
receivables and payables with its subsidiaries and oth-
er related parties.

Rating

Our corporate credit rating is covered by the three
leading rating agencies, Moody's, Standard & Poor's
and Fitch.

In the course of 2017, Moody's raised the corpo-
rate credit rating from Ba1 to Baa3 with a stable out-
look and Standard & Poor's raised the outlook from
stable to positive. We are now rated investment
grade by all three rating agencies. More information
can be found in table 2.23.

Effect of off-balance-sheet financing
instruments on our financial position
and assets and liabilities

We are not involved in off-balance-sheet transactions
that are likely to materially affect our financial posi-
tion, results of operations, liquidity, capital expendi-
tures, assets or capitalization.

Sources of liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are typically cash pro-
vided by operating activities, cash provided by short-
term debt from third parties and related parties, as
well as proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt
and equity securities. We require this capital primar-
ily to finance working capital needs, fund acquisitions
and clinics in which we have ownership of less than
100%, develop free-standing renal dialysis clinics and
other health care facilities, purchase equipment for
existing or new renal dialysis clinics and production
sites, repay debt, pay dividends and repurchase shares.
For more information, see the “Net cash provided by
(used in) investing activities” section starting on page 50
and the “Net cash provided by (used in) financing
activities” section starting on page 51.

At December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash
equivalents of €978M compared to €709M at Decem-
ber 31, 2016.

Free cash flow (net cash provided by (used in)
operating activities, after capital expenditures, before
acquisitions and investments) amounted to €1,351M
in 2017 (2016: €1,017M). Free cash flow is a Non-IFRS
Measure and is reconciled to net cash provided by
(used in) operating activities, the most directly com-
parable IFRS measure in the section “Performance
management system” starting on page 24. Free cash flow
in percent of revenue was 7.6% in 2017 (2016: 6.1%).

Net cash provided by (used in)
operating activities

During 2017 and 2016 we generated net cash provided
by operating activities of €2,192M and €1,932M, re-
spectively. Net cash provided by operating activities
in percent of revenue was 12% for 2017 (2016: 12%).

Cash provided by (used in) operating activities
is impacted by the profitability of our business, the
development of our working capital, principally in-
ventories, receivables and cash outflows that occur
due to a number of specific items as discussed below.
The increase in net cash provided by operating activ-
ities was largely driven by the payment related to the
va Agreement, the impact of the 2016 discretionary
contribution of €90M to pension plan assets in the
u.s. and the timing of other working capital items,
partially offset by higher income tax payments.

The profitability of our business depends signifi-
cantly on reimbursement rates. Approximately 82% of
our revenue is generated by providing health care
services, a major portion of which is reimbursed by
either public health care organizations or private in-
surers. In 2017, approximately 34% of our consolidated
revenue was attributable to u.s. federal health care
benefit programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursement. Legislative changes could affect
Medicare reimbursement rates for a significant por-
tion of the services we provide, as well as the scope
of Medicare coverage. A decrease in reimbursement

rates or the scope of coverage could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations and thus on our capacity to
generate cash flow.

While we have generally experienced stable re-
imbursement globally, including the balancing of un-
favorable reimbursement changes in certain countries
with favorable changes in other countries, the stabil-
ity of reimbursement in the u.s. has been affected by
(1) the implementation of the EsrD pps in January 2011,
(il) the U.s. federal government across the board
spending cuts in payments to Medicare providers
commonly referred to as “U.S. Sequestration”, (III) the
phased reduction to the EsRD pps rate to account for
the decline in utilization of certain drugs and bio-
logicals associated with dialysis pursuant to the
American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) as subse-
quently modified under the Protecting Access to
Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA) and (Iv) cms's 2016 final
rule on the Physician Fee Schedule with material de-
creases in reimbursement for certain procedures.

We intend to continue to address our current
cash and financing requirements using cash provided
by operating activities, our existing and future credit
agreements, issuances under the commercial paper
program (see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements) as well as the utilization of the
Accounts Receivable Facility. In addition, when funds
are required for acquisitions or to meet other needs,
we expect to successfully complete long-term financ-
ing arrangements, such as the issuance of bonds. We
aim to preserve financial resources with a minimum
of €500M of committed and unutilized credit facilities.

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activi-
ties depends on the collection of accounts receivable.
Commercial customers and governments generally
have different payment cycles. Lengthening their pay-
ment cycles could have a material adverse effect on
our capacity to generate cash flow. In addition, we
could face difficulties in enforcing and collecting ac-
counts receivable under some countries’ legal sys-
tems and due to the economic conditions in some
countries. Accounts receivable balances, net of valu-
ation allowances, represented Days Sales Outstand-
ing (DSO) of 67 days at December 31, 2017, a decrease
as compared to 70 days at December 31, 2016.

Dso by segment is calculated by dividing the
segment’s accounts receivable, converted to euro
using the average exchange rate for the period pre-
sented, less any value added tax included in the
receivables, by the average daily sales for the last
twelve months of that segment, converted to euro
using the average exchange rate for the period.
Receivables and sales are adjusted for amounts re-
lated to acquisitions and divestitures made within
the reporting period with a purchase price above a
€50M threshold as defined in the Amended 2012
Credit Agreement.

Table 2.24 on page 50 Shows the development of
Dso by reporting segment.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2017

The Dso decrease in the North America Seg-
ment was largely due to the impact of the va Agree-
ment, partially offset by an influx of accounts receiv-
able following the assignment of new billing numbers
for the 18 added escos as of January 1, 2017. The Dso
increase in the EMEA Segment was due to payment
fluctuations in the region. The Asia-Pacific Segment’s
Dso decrease primarily reflects an improvement of
payment collections in China. The Latin America Seg-
ment’s pso decrease reflects collections from public
health care organizations in certain countries.

Due to the fact that a large portion of our re-
imbursement is provided by public health care orga-
nizations and private insurers, we expect that most
of our accounts receivable will be collectible.

We are subject to ongoing and future tax audits
in the u.s., Germany and other jurisdictions. With
respect to these potential adjustments and disallow-
ances of tax matters currently under review, we do
not anticipate that an unfavorable ruling could have
a material impact on our results of operations. We
are not currently able to determine the timing of
these potential additional tax payments.

Net cash provided by (used in)
investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities was €992M and
€1,246 M for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Table 2.25 shows
our capital expenditures for property, plant and equip-
ment, net of proceeds from sales of property, plant
and equipment as well as acquisitions, investments
and purchases of intangible assets for 2017 and 2016.

The majority of our capital expenditures were
used for maintaining existing clinics, equipping new
clinics, maintenance and expansion of production
facilities (primarily in the North America Segment,
France and Germany), capitalization of machines pro-
vided to our customers and for Care Coordination as
well as capitalization of certain development costs.
Development costs were incurred and capitalized.
Capital expenditures were approximately 5% of total
revenue in 2017 (2016: 6%).

The investments during 2017 were mainly driven
by acquisitions of clinics in the North America Seg-
ment and a Care Coordination acquisition in the
Asia-Pacific Segment. Additionally, in 2017, we re-
ceived €415 M from divestitures mainly related to the

tions including the issuance of a euro term loan under
the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement, proceeds from
short-term debt including issuances of commercial
papers as well as drawings under the Accounts

for the repayments of long-term debt and capital
lease obligations, repayments of short-term debt, dis-
tributions to noncontrolling interests as well as the
payment of dividends, partially offset by proceeds
from short-term debt and the increase in the utiliza-
tion of our Accounts Receivable Facility.

On May 16, 2017, we paid a dividend with re-
spect to 2016 of €0.96 per share (dividend for 2015
paid in 2016: €0.80). The total dividend payment was
€294M and €244M in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

An additional source of liquidity is our commer-
cial paper program under which up to €1,000M of
short-term notes can be issued on a flexible and con-
tinuous basis. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 €680M

Our pension liabilities are not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments. The regular or special funding of our pension plans may

adversely affect our liquidity in the future periods. The liability recognized in our consolidated financial statements may fluctuate significantly in future periods

due to changes in assumptions, in particular the discount rate, rate of future compensation increases and pension progression. Actual results could differ from

assumptions due to changing market, economic and governmental regulatory conditions, thereby resulting in an increase or decrease of the liability. Employer

contributions expected to be paid to the defined benefit plans during fiscal year 2018 are €1 M. For additional information regarding our pension plans and

expected payments for the next ten years, see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

Our debt instruments, including the Amended
2012 Credit Agreement, outstanding bonds and the
Accounts Receivable Facility contain covenants re-
stricting or limiting our ability to dispose of assets,
incur additional debt, create liens or engage in sale-
lease backs — although these are subject to a number
of exceptions and qualifications or may be suspended
based on a ratings trigger. In addition, under our
Amended 2012 Credit Agreement and Accounts Re-
ceivable Facility, we are obligated to maintain a maxi-
mum consolidated leverage ratio (ratio of consolidat-
ed funded debt less cash and cash equivalents to
consolidated EBITDA) as these terms are defined in
these financing agreements.

A breach of any of the covenants in any of the
instruments or agreements governing our long-term
debt could, in turn, create additional defaults under
one or more of the other instruments or agreements.
In default, the outstanding balance under the Amend-
ed 2012 Credit Agreement becomes due at the option
of the lenders under that agreement and the “cross
default” provisions in our other long-term debt per-
mit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of other
debt upon such a default. As of December 31, 2017,
we were in compliance with all covenants under the
Amended 2012 Credit Agreement and our other fi-
nancing agreements. For information regarding our
Amended 2012 Credit Agreement, the bonds and the
Accounts Receivable Facility, see note 14 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements.

Although current and future economic condi-
tions could adversely affect our business and our prof-
itability, we believe that we are well positioned to
continue to grow our business while meeting our fi-
nancial obligations as they come due. Due to the
non-discretionary nature of the health care services
we provide, the need for health care products utilized
to provide such services and the availability of gov-
ernment reimbursement for a substantial portion of
our health care services, our business is generally not
cyclical. A substantial portion of our accounts receiv-
able are generated by governmental payors. While
payment and collection practices vary significantly
between countries and even between agencies with-
in one country, government payors usually represent
low to moderate, credit risks. However, limited or
expensive access to capital could make it more diffi-
cult for our customers to do business with us, or to
do business generally, which could adversely affect
our business by causing our customers to reduce or
delay their purchases of our health care products. For
further information, see the “Results of operations”
section starting on page 38. If the conditions in the capi-
tal markets worsen, they could also increase our fi-
nancing costs and limit our financial flexibility.

Our General Partner and our Supervisory Board
will propose to the shareholders at our Annual Gen-
eral Meeting on May 17, 2018, a dividend with respect
to 2017 and payable in 2018, of €1.06 per share (for
2016 paid in 2017: €0.96). The total expected dividend

payment is approximately €325™M compared to divi-
dends of €294M paid in 2017 with respect to 2016.

Our 2018 principal financing needs are the pay-
ments outstanding for the planned acquisition of
NxStage, repayment of bonds in September 2018 as
well as quarterly payments under our Amended 2012
Credit Agreement Term Loans. These payments as
well as our dividend payment of approximately €325 M
in May 2018, and the anticipated capital expenditures,
and further acquisition payments are expected to be
covered by our cash flows, using existing credit facil-
ities and, if required, additional debt financing. We
currently have sufficient flexibility under our debt cov-
enants to meet our financing needs in the near future.
Generally, we believe that we will have sufficient fi-
nancing to achieve our goals in the future and to
continue to promote our growth.

NET ASSETS

Our total assets were €24,025 M, a decrease of €1,478M
(6%) over the prior year. At Constant Exchange Rates,
total assets would have increased by €1,120 M (4%) to
€26,624M.

Non-current assets decreased by €969 M (5%) to
€17,651M in 2017 and remained stable at 73% of total
assets. At Constant Exchange Rates, they would have
increased by 5% to €19,565™M compared to prior year.
This was primarily a result of the increase in goodwill
due to business combinations and capital expendi-
tures.

Current assets decreased by 7% to €6,374M (an
increase of 3% at Constant Exchange Rates). The in-
crease at Constant Exchange Rates was mainly the
result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents due
to the reinvestment of sold available for sale financial
assets, trade accounts receivable and higher invento-
ries due to increased finished goods. This increase
was partially offset by a decrease in other current
assets due to divestitures of available for sale finan-
cial assets and due to the repayment of insurance
recovery receivables in relation to the NaturaLyte®
and GranuFlo® agreement in principle.

On the liability side of the balance sheet our
total liabilities were €13,197 M at December 31, 2017, a
decrease of €1,256™M (9%) from €14,453M in 2016. At
Constant Exchange Rates total liabilities decreased by
1%. The decrease in long-term debt at Constant Ex-
change Rates was partially offset by higher short-
term debt and an increase in current portion of long-
term debt. Additionally, deferred tax liabilities
decreased due to the remeasurement of deferred tax
balances as a result of the u.s. Tax Reform. Current
provisions and other current liabilities increased at
Constant Exchange Rates due to additions related to
the impact of the FcPA Related Charge. An offsetting
effect resulted from utilization of the provision in re-
lation to the NaturaLyte® and GranuFlo® agreement
in principle.

€1,653M of our debt are current liabilities, an
increase of €354M (€425M at Constant Exchange
Rates) as compared to €1,299 M last year. The increase
was mainly a result of the reclassification of euro- and
u.s. dollar-denominated Bonds to current portion of
long-term debt, as these Bonds will mature during
the third quarter of 2018, as well as the additional
issuance of Commercial Paper. This was partially off-
set by the repayment of u.s. dollar-denominated
Bonds that matured in the third quarter of 2017 and
a reduction of the quarterly repayments of the
Amended 2012 Credit Agreement. Long-term debt de-
creased to €5,795 M from €6,833M in the prior year, a
decrease of €1,038M (€474M at Constant Exchange
Rates). This decrease at Constant Exchange Rates was
mainly a result of the reclassification of euro- and u.s.
dollar-denominated Bonds to current portion of long-
term debt. The decrease was partially offset by addi-
tional drawings under the Accounts Receivable Facil-
ity. See also note 14 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.

Shareholders’ equity decreased by 2% to €10,828M.
At Constant Exchange Rates, equity increased by
€1,218M. This increase at Constant Exchange Rates is
mainly due to the net income, the valuation of non-
controlling interests subject to put provisions at fair
value and proceeds from exercised stock options. This
increase was partially offset by dividend payments,
contributions to noncontrolling interests, purchase of
treasury stock and effects from purchase/sale of non-
controlling interests. The equity to assets ratio in-
creased to 45% at December 31, 2017 from 43% at
December 31, 2016.

On Group level the Roc increased from 7.8% at
December 31, 2016 to 8.6% at December 31, 2017.
Within the position invested capital the goodwill had
a significant impact on the calculation of the RoIc. In
2017 the RoIC on Group level substantially exceeded
our cost of capital. The Weighted Average Cost of
Capital was 6.2%.

For supplementary information on capital man-
agement and capital structure see also note 18 of the
notes to the consolidated financial statements.

THE MANAGEMENT'S
GENERAL ASSESSMENT

In 2017 we continued the success story of Fresenius
Medical Care with another record year. We managed
an unusual number of severe natural disasters, have
delivered on our revenue and net income growth
targets, and again we are able to propose the high-
est dividend in our Company’s history at the Annual
General Meeting in May 2018. With the acquisition
of the Cura Group in Australia and our planned ac-
quisition of NxStage we are setting the course for
the future. We also intend to continue the profitable
growth track among other things with the second
phase of our Global Efficiency Program that we an-
nounced in 2017.

At the time this Management Report was pre-
pared, the Management Board continued to assess
the development of Fresenius Medical Care as posi-
tive. Demand for our products and services continue
to grow steadily around the world.

OUTLOOK

The outlook describes how
Fresenius Medical Care expects
to perform in fiscal year 2018.

THE MANAGEMENT'S
GENERAL ASSESSMENT

In the financial year 2018 and beyond, we intend to
continue the profitable growth track of Fresenius
Medical Care. In the future, we plan to further opti-
mize our portfolio in the core dialysis as well as in the
Care Coordination business. By implementing the
second phase of our Global Efficiency Program, we
will continue to improve our profitability in the com-
ing years. We expect these activities to lead to further
net income growth in the future.

These statements take into account all events
known at the time the financial statements were pre-
pared which could affect the development of our
business in 2018. As in the past, we are committed to
achieving and, if possible, exceeding our targets.

BUSINESS POLICY

Fresenius Medical Care is the world’s leading dial-
ysis Company. We aim to further expand this posi-
tion in the years ahead. As always, the basic prin-
ciple of our corporate strategy is to fully capture
the potential of being a vertically integrated com-
pany. This means consistently making use of the
advantages that arise from covering the complete
value chain of dialysis. Fresenius Medical Care in-
tends to make steady progress in the provision of
holistic care to dialysis patients and dialysis-related

treatments. In addition to our products and dialysis
treatment itself, we will continue to expand our
activities in the area of Care Coordination and offer
supplementary medical services for the treatment
of our patients in the future.

We have no plans to make significant changes
to our business policy.

SECTOR-SPECIFIC
ENVIRONMENT —
DIALYSIS MARKET

The Company expects the number of dialysis patients
worldwide to grow by about 6% in 2018. Some signifi-
cant regional differences are likely to remain: The
Company anticipates an increase in the u.s., Japan
and Western and Central Europe of 0 to 4%. The num-
ber of patients with chronic kidney disease is already
relatively high in these regions and patients general-
ly have reliable access to treatment, normally dialysis.
In economically weaker regions, the growth rates will
be higher. We expect patient numbers to continue
growing in the coming years — see table 2.29.

Our growth strategy is based on an in-depth
analysis of the major trends affecting Fresenius
Medical Care:
> Demographic change: Demographic factors are

one of the main reasons for the continued

growth of dialysis markets. As average life ex-
pectancy rises worldwide, the share of older
people in the population is also growing. How-
ever, kidney function deteriorates with age. The
future number of dialysis patients is therefore
expected to increase from around 3.2m world-

wide in 2017 to 4.9M in 2025.
> Increase in lifestyle diseases: Diseases such as

high blood pressure and diabetes are on the rise

around the world. They can cause damage to
the entire organism and also often impair kid-
ney function in the long-term.

> Improved access to medical care: Thanks to on-
going efforts to establish and expand balanced
and sustainable health care systems in many
countries around the globe, a growing number
of patients are gaining access to suitable dialy-
sis treatments for the first time. We expect this
trend to continue and drive demand for
high-quality products and treatments.

> Changes in the health care industry: The health
care industry is constantly changing. We believe
that demand for the holistic care of chronic pa-
tients will continue to rise. In future, the focus
when treating kidney patients will no longer be
simply on offering individual dialysis products
or services, but also on combining all fields of
application related to dialysis and coordinating
them more effectively.

We do not expect any significant changes regarding
treatment methods. Hemodialysis will remain the
treatment of choice, accounting for about 89% of all
dialysis therapies. Peritoneal dialysis will continue to
be the preferred treatment for about 11% of all dialy-
sis patients.

The volume of the worldwide dialysis market,
which amounted to about €70 BN last year according
to preliminary estimates, is expected to increase by
around 4% per year. This is based on the assumption
that exchange rates will remain stable in the forecast-
ing period. The overall volume of the dialysis market
could thus reach around €72 BN by 2018.

In addition, the reimbursement and ancillary
services utilization environment significantly influenc-
es our business. In the u.s., our biggest sales market,
the reimbursements of governmental institutions are
lower than the reimbursements of private insurers
and managed care organizations. Therefore a change
in the portion of reimbursements by private insurers
in the u.s. influences our business.

THE COMPANY'S
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
IN 2018

Fresenius Medical Care's outlook for 2018 is based on
the prevailing exchange rates at the beginning of
the year. The outlook 2018 is excluding the impacts
from the acquisition of NxStage.

The expected developments might be influ-
enced by developments described in the “Risks and
opportunities report” starting on page 59.

Our “Outlook” for the financial year 2018 is sum-
marized in table 2.30 on page 58.

REVENUE

We aim to further increase our revenue at Constant
Currency by approximately 8% in 2018. This growth
rate is based on 2017 revenue adjusted for the impacts
from the IFRs 15 implementation of €486 mM.

RESULT OF OPERATIONS

Operating income
We expect operating income to grow by 12 to 14% at
Constant Currency and Delivered EBIT to grow by 13
to 15% at Constant Currency in 2018.

Net income
Including the recurring effects of the U.s. Tax Reform
in 2018 in the amount of €140 M to €160M, we aim to
achieve an increase in net income (net income attrib-
utable to shareholders of FMC AG & CO. KGAA) by 13 to
15% in 2018 at Constant Currency.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share are expected to develop in
the same way as net income in 2018 compared to 2017.


--- Page 40 ---

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND
ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS

In 2018, we intend to spend around €1.9 BN to €2.2 BN
on capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments.
Capital expenditures should account for €0.9BN to
€1.0BN. Around 40% of this amount is earmarked for
expansion investments. Approximately €1.0BN to
€1.2BN is to be used for mainly bolt-on acquisitions
and equity investments in health care.

Capital expenditures will primarily be used to
expand our worldwide production capacities and ra-
tionalize production processes, to equip new dialysis
clinics and distributors as well as for maintenance.

LIQUIDITY
Cash flow

In 2018, net cash provided by operating activities in
percent of revenue is again expected to account for
more than 10%.

In 2018, free cash flow in percent of revenue is
again expected to account for more than 4% of rev-
enue.

Net leverage ratio

Fresenius Medical Care uses the net leverage ratio as
a guideline in its long-term financial planning. The
ratio was 2.1 at the end of 2017. The target figure is
expected to be better than 2.5 at the end of 2018.

PROFITABILITY

We expect ROIC to be at least 8.0% compared to 8.6%
in 2017.

DIVIDEND

Fresenius Medical Care intends to continue its profit-
oriented dividend policy in principle. Information on
the proposed dividend increase can be found in the
“Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities”
section starting on page 51.

NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
INDICATORS

Employees

Due to the anticipated expansion of our business, we
expect the number of employees to grow in all re-
gions in 2018, particularly in the area of health care.
By the end of 2018, the number of employees working
for Fresenius Medical Care is estimated to increase to
more than 117,000 (full-time equivalents).

Research and development

We aim to spend €140M to €150M on research and
development in 2018. The number of personnel con-
cerned (currently 825 full-time equivalents) should
not change significantly.

GLOBAL EFFICIENCY
PROGRAM

In 2017, we announced phase 1! of our Global Efficien-
cy Program (GEP II). The program's objectives are to
identify and realize further efficiency potential and
enhance our overall competitiveness. Starting in 2018,
GEP Il targets to achieve sustained cost improvements
of €100M to €200M per annum by 2020.

GROWTH STRATEGY
2020

In 2014, we set ourselves new long-term targets with
our growth strategy 2020 (Vision 2020). The goal of
this growth strategy was to increase revenue to €24 BN
by fiscal year 2020, based upon exchange rates prevail-
ing at the beginning of 2017. In addition, we indicated
an average annual revenue growth rate of approxi-
mately 10% and average annual growth of net income
attributable to shareholders of FMC AG&CO. KGAA in
the high single-digit range, based upon exchange
rates prevailing at the beginning of 2017. Excluding
the effect from the implementation of IFRS 15 and ex-
cluding the recurring impacts from the u.s. Tax Re-
form (€140M to €160M annually) in the years 2018 to
2020 we reconfirm these goals.

RISKS AND
OPPORTUNITIES
REPORT

As an enterprise with global
operations, the Company is
naturally exposed to risks as-
sociated with its business activ-
ities. Ultimately, the Company
can only leverage opportunities
for its business if it is willing to
take certain risks. Many years
of expertise and the Company's
extensive knowledge of the
markets enable it to uncover
and assess risks and opportuni-
ties for its business.

RISKS AND OPPORTUNI-
TIES MANAGEMENT

The Company sees risk management as the ongoing
task of determining, analyzing and evaluating the
spectrum of actual and potential risks within the Com-
pany’s operations and its environment, and, where
possible, taking corrective measures. The risk man-
agement system provides the Company with a basis
for these activities. It enables management to identi-
fy risks that could jeopardize the Company's growth
or going concern, and to take steps to minimize any
negative impact. As such, it is an important compo-
nent of the Company’s management and governance.

Long-term success for the Company is secured
by actively managing opportunities. The aim here is
to identify and assess opportunities as early as pos-
sible, and to initiate appropriate measures so that
opportunities can be turned into business successes
for the Company. Identified long-term and medium-
term opportunities are taken into account in our
strategy and budget planning. Short-term opportu-
nities, provided that they are aligned with business
interests and targets, are seized by on-going busi-
ness operations.

RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Risk management is part of the Company's integrated
management system. The main objective is to identi-
fy potential risks as early as possible to assess their
impact on the business activities and, where neces-
sary, to take appropriate countermeasures. Due to
constantly changing external as well as internal re-
quirements and conditions, risk management at
Fresenius Medical Care is continuously evolving. In
the past financial year, Group-wide risk management
continued to adjust the Company's risk management
approach with focus on organizational anchoring as
well as a more detailed design of processes and will
continue with these activities in 2018.

The structure of the internal risk monitoring
system is based on the internationally recognized
framework for company-wide risk management, the
“Enterprise Risk Management — Integrated Frame-
work” of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (coso). Opportunities
are not covered by the implemented risk manage-
ment system.

As part of the risk monitoring system, region-
al risk coordinators assume the task of coordinating
risk management activities within the regions and
selected functions with the help of risk manage-
ment software. These activities relate to existing and
potential emerging short-term as well as medium-
term risks. In addition, risk coordinators are respon-
sible for reporting risks to the finance boards of the
regions or functions. Twice a year, the central risk
management function collects risk management re-
ports from the regions and functions. These reports
are analyzed, consolidated and communicated to
the executive management board. The focus during
this process is on significant risks, which are above
a defined threshold.

The executive management board and central
risk management are promptly informed of risks that
are estimated to be high or develop into high risks in
order to ensure appropriate responses. The effective-
ness of the risk management system is monitored by
the Audit and Corporate Governance Committee of
the Supervisory Board.

The organizational structure of risk management
at Fresenius Medical Care as well as the previously
described processes are shown in chart 2.31 on page 60.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2017

In addition to risk reporting, standard reporting
to management is an important tool for managing
and controlling risks as well as for taking preventive
measures in a timely manner. Therefore, the Manage-
ment Board of the Company is informed on a month-
ly basis about the industry situation, the Company’s
operating and non-operating business, and the out-
come of analyses of the Company's earnings and fi-
nancial position, as well as of the assets position on
a quarterly basis.

Part of the risk management system is the Glob-
al Internal Audit department, which is regularly in-
formed about the results of the risk management
system. This department determines risk focus areas
and audits a selected number of Company depart-
ments, subsidiaries and IT applications worldwide
each year. The department works according to the
internationally accepted standards of the Institute of
Internal Auditors (IIA), which was confirmed by a
quality assessment in 2017. The scope of internal au-
diting is widespread and involves, among other activ-
ities, periodic assessment of the effectiveness of con-
trols (including legal compliance controls) over
business processes, IT security, the reliability of finan-
cial reporting and compliance with accounting regu-
lations and internal policies. The Company's locations
and units to be audited are determined annually on
the basis of a selection model taking various risks into
consideration. This annual audit plan is reviewed and
approved by the Management Board and the Audit
and Corporate Governance Committee of the Super-
visory Board. All audit reports with material observa-
tions are presented to the Management Board. The
Global Internal Audit department is also responsible
for monitoring the implementation of measures
documented in the reports. The Management Board
is informed about the implementation status on a

2.31 RISK REPORTING

quarterly basis. The Audit and Corporate Governance
Committee of the Supervisory Board is also informed
of the audit results. In 2017, a total of 54 audits were
carried out.

Nevertheless it is important to note that even a
functioning and adequate risk management system
like the Company’s cannot guarantee that all risks are
fully identified and controlled.

INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THE
GROUP’S ACCOUNTING PROCESS

The Company's internal control system over financial
reporting ensures compliance with applicable ac-
counting standards. The goal is to provide reasonable
assurance that the Group financial statements are
issued in accordance with appropriate accounting
principles. The Company’s internal reporting process
is generally carried out at four levels and ensures that
financial data and key figures are reliably recorded,
processed and controlled. At each of these four re-
porting levels — the local entity, the region, the seg-
ment and the entire Group — the figures and data are
compared regularly on a monthly and quarterly basis
with the previous year’s values, budget targets, and
the latest projections. In addition, the Management
Board and the departments responsible for preparing
the annual and consolidated Group financial state-
ments discuss all parameters, assumptions and esti-
mates that substantially affect the Group and seg-
ment results reported externally. The Audit and
Corporate Governance Committee of the Supervisory
Board also reviews current quarterly results and com-
pares them with budgets and projections.

The internal control system contains guidelines
and instructions that ensure that all Company trans-
actions are recorded appropriately and presented
accurately.

Further control mechanisms to ensure reliable
financial reporting and correct recording of transac-
tions within the accounting and the consolidation
process include automated and manual reconcilia-
tions as well as the separation of certain personnel
functions to prevent potential conflicts of interest.
The fact that all process owners assess the risks of
their respective processes in terms of their implica-
tions for accounting also ensures that risks with a
direct impact on financial reporting are identified and
that controls are in place to minimize these risks.
Changes to accounting standards are discussed on an
ongoing basis and considered in the preparation of
the financial statements. Employees responsible for
financial reporting are given regular training to be up
to date with changes regarding accounting standards.
The consolidation is performed centrally by the de-
partment which is responsible for the group account-
ing. The basis for the consolidation is derived from
reporting packages and sub-group consolidated fi-
nancial statements prepared and submitted by the
local group entities. The preparation of the reporting
packages and the sub-group consolidated financial
statements is performed according to central require-
ments and guidelines.

As the Company is also listed on the New York
Stock Exchange, it is required to adhere to the re-
quirements of the u.s. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Sox). Sec-
tion 404 of this federal law stipulates that the man-
agement boards of companies listed in the u.s. must
take responsibility for implementing and adhering to
an appropriate internal control system to produce
reliable financial reporting. Based on this requirement,
the design and operating effectiveness of the internal
control system over financial reporting are routinely
tested and considered in regular internal audits.
These criteria are also included in the review by the
Company’s independent auditors.

The internal control system over financial re-
porting follows the criteria of the coso model. This
was developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Or-
ganizations of the Treadway Commission and is rec-
ognized as a standard by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). In accordance with the coso mod-
el, the internal control system over financial reporting
is divided into the five components: control environ-
ment, risk assessment, control activities, information
and communication, as well as the monitoring of the
internal control system. Each of these components is
regularly documented, tested and assessed. The
Company aligned its internal controls to fulfil the re-
quirements of the coso model.

The Company's review of the internal control
system over financial reporting complies with a spe-
cific sec guideline (Guidance Regarding Manage-
ment’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Re-
porting) and is conducted with software support. In
a first step, regional project teams coordinate the
assessment of the internal control system in each re-
gion, after which the results are consolidated for the
whole Group. Based on this, management then eval-
uates the effectiveness of the internal control system
for the current fiscal year. External advisers are con-
sulted as needed. A corporate steering committee
meets several times a year to review changes and
new requirements of sox, to discuss possible control
deficiencies, and derive further measures. In addition,
in its meetings, the Audit and Corporate Governance
Committee of the Supervisory Board is informed reg-
ularly of the results of management's assessment.

As of December 31, 2017, management assessed
the Company’s internal control system over financial
reporting and deemed it effective.

Internal control systems over financial reporting
are subject to inherent limitations, no matter how
carefully they are designed. As a result, there is no
absolute assurance that financial reporting objectives
can be met, nor that misstatements will always be
prevented or detected.

RISKS

The following section describes significant risks which
could have an impact on our business operations. In
the course of the risk assessment an estimation of the
risks takes place regarding the likelihood of occur-
rence and the potential impact in the respective as-
sessment period, allowing a prioritization of the risks
into the classifications “low” “medium” and “high”.
Besides quantitative factors, especially qualitative fac-
tors are applied. For the identification of strategic
developments, besides the short-term consideration
(one year), risks can also be assessed in terms of a
medium impact within the subsequent five years.

The scales for classification of potential impact
and likelihood as well as the localization of the risks
within the risk matrix are depicted in chart 2.32 on
page 62. The depicted risk areas as well as measures
for mitigating the impact or the probability of occur-
rence of risks within these areas are described in the
following section.

The risk situation of Fresenius Medical Care is
described in detail on the following pages.

If the Company fails to comply with one or more of
these laws or regulations, this may give rise to a num-
ber of adverse legal consequences. These include, in
particular, loss or suspension of governmental certi-
fications, loss or suspension of licenses under the
laws of governmental authority from which we gen-
erate substantial revenues, monetary and administra-
tive penalties, recall actions and claims for damages,
increased costs for compliance with government or-
ders, complete or partial exclusion from government
reimbursement programs, refunds of payments re-
ceived from government payors and government
health care program beneficiaries due to any failures
to meet applicable requirements or complete or par-
tial curtailment of the Company's authority to con-
duct business. In the end, these types of risks could
no longer be insured under reasonable terms. Includ-
ing the considerable costs of legal defense, all the
consequences mentioned above could have a mate-
rial adverse effect on the Company's business, results
of operations and financial condition.

A number of the health care businesses in the
u.s., that the Company operates is owned, or man-
aged, by joint ventures in which one or more hospi-
tals, physicians or physician practice groups hold an
interest. While the Company has structured its joint
venture arrangements with physicians to comply with
many of the criteria for safe harbor protection under
the federal and state Anti-Kickback Statutes, its in-
vestments in these joint venture arrangements do not
satisfy all elements of such safe harbor. If one or more
of its joint ventures were found to be in violation of
the Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law, the Com-
pany could be required to restructure or terminate
them. The Company also could be required to repay
to Medicare, Medicaid as well as other federal health
care amounts pursuant to any prohibited referrals,
and the Company could be subject to monetary pen-
alties and exclusion from federal and state health care
programs. Imposition of any of these penalties could
have a material adverse impact on its business, results
of operations and financial condition.

To ensure that our products and services com-
ply with the quality requirements, we implemented
quality management systems in the different regions.
The employees have access to procedures and work
instructions to ensure that the applicable quality re-
quirements are met. In addition, we conduct internal
reviews of the production sites and clinics to monitor
compliance with quality standards of our products
and services. Furthermore, our plants and hospitals
are also subject to external reviews by the relevant
supervisory authorities. Compliance programs imple-
mented in the regions reduce the risk of legal viola-
tions by providing general and specific rules of con-
duct and procedures as well as regular training of the
employees according to the specifications.

u.s. federal health care programs
As stated in the “Macroeconomic and sector-specific
environment” section starting on page 32, Our dialysis
clinics in the u.s. participate in the Quality Incentive
Program (qiP) within the ESRD prospective payment
system (PPS). Payment reductions of up to 2% of
Medicare reimbursements based on previous year’s
performance can be made if the quality standards of
the vp are not met in the clinics. Should Fresenius
Medical Care fail to meet the Qvp’s minimum require-
ments to a greater extent, this could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

Through our value-based agreements and health
insurance products, we assume the risk of both med-
ical and administrative costs for certain patients in
return for fixed periodic payments from governmental
and commercial insurers. The Company currently par-
ticipates in programs such as the “Bundled Payments
for Care Improvement” (BPC!) program, the “Compre-
hensive EsRD Care initiative” of the cms, and the
“Medicare Advantage chronic special needs plans”
(MA-CSNP), as well as remuneration agreements with
insurers under which the Company receives a fixed
remuneration to cover all, or a defined amount of
treatment costs, for a defined quantity of patients.
Details and detailed descriptions of the above men-
tioned and other programs in which the Company
participates can be found in the “Macroeconomic and
sector-specific environment” section starting on page 32.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2017

Under the speci, which is a cms pilot initiative
extended through September 30, 2018, we can receive
additional payments if we are able to deliver quality
care at a cost that is lower than certain established
benchmarks, but also have the risk of incurring finan-
cial penalties if we are not successful in doing so.
Should we fail to perform as required under the BPci
initiative and our agreement with cms, cms may,
among other remedies, terminate our right to partic-
ipate in the BPci program, in whole or in part. On
January 9, 2018, CMS announced the launch of a new
bundled payment model named Bundled Payments
for Care Improvement Advanced. We plan to partici-
pate in spc! Advanced in the future.

Under cms’s Comprehensive ESRD Care Model,
dialysis providers and physicians can form entities
known as ESRD Seamless Care Organizations (ESCOs).
Escos that achieve the program’s minimum quality
thresholds and generate reductions in cms’s cost of
care above certain thresholds for the EsRD patients
covered by the Esco will receive a share of the cost
savings. However, Escos that include dialysis chains
with more than 200 facilities are required to share in
the risk of cost increases and reimburse cms a share
of any such increases.

As part of the MA-CSNP program, we entered
into sub-capitation and other shared savings arrange-
ments with certain payors. There is a risk if the costs
of care exceed the fix payments per patient per
month. In this case, the difference is to be refunded
by us to the payor.

Regarding the MA-csnP the premiums we
charge and our bids are based on our estimates of
future medical costs over the fixed contract period.
Nevertheless many factors, e.g. increased cost of in-
dividual services or new mandated benefits (such as
the expansion of essential benefits coverage), may
cause actual costs to exceed those estimated. Failure
to adequately price our products or estimate the
costs of providing benefits to our beneficiaries, or
effectively manage our operating expenses, may re-
sult in a material adverse effect on our results of op-
erations, financial position, and cash flows.

Although efforts to repeal the Affordable Care
Act have been unsuccessful, further efforts and the
attitude of cms can influence the future of such pro-
jects in ways that we currently can neither quantify
nor predict.

The reserves that we establish for health insur-
ance policy benefits and other contractual rights and
benefits are based upon assumptions and judgments
concerning a number of factors, including trends in
health care costs, expenses, general economic condi-
tions and other factors. To the extent the actual
claims experience is less favorable than estimated
based on our underlying assumptions, our incurred
losses could increase and future earnings could be
adversely affected.

The profitability of our value based agreements
and insurance products is dependent in part upon our
ability to contract on favorable terms with hospitals,
physicians and other health care providers. The fail-
ure to maintain or to secure cost-effective health care
provider contracts may result in a loss of beneficiaries
or higher medical costs, which could adversely affect
our business.

We cannot give any assurance that we will
achieve the cost savings required or contemplated by
these programs, which could have a material adverse
effect on our operating results.

The Company mitigated the impact of the EsRD
Pps and the other legislative initiatives referenced
above with two broad measures. First, it works with
medical directors and treating physicians to make
clinical protocol changes used in treating patients
consistent with the qip and good clinical practices,
and it negotiates pharmaceutical acquisition cost sav-
ings. In addition, the Company achieved greater effi-
ciencies and better patient outcomes by introducing
new initiatives to improve patient care upon initiation
of dialysis, increase the percentage of patients using
home therapies and achieve additional cost reduc-
tions in its clinics.

Composition of our customer base
In terms of global product business as well as dialysis
business outside the u.s. the market for Fresenius
Medical Care differs strongly across regions. While
customers of our products and services are very dif-
ferentiated in some countries, in other countries
there is a situation with comparatively few customers
or payors but large volumes of business each. In cer-
tain cases, a resulting dependency on the payment
behavior and decisions of these business partners can
adversely affect the Company's business, results of
operations and financial condition.

We counteract these risks by actively negotiating
long-term contracts with major customers, targeted
marketing activities, developing new product and pric-
ing models, and constantly improving our service and
quality. In addition, the fact that many of our products
and services are remunerated directly or indirectly by
government institutions reduces the risk of payment
default. Nonetheless, continuous monitoring of claims
maturities and overdue receivables takes place.


--- Page 48 ---

Reimbursement by private insurers
In the u.s. a portion of the dialysis treatments is re-
imbursed by private insurers and integrated care or-
ganizations; these reimbursements are in general
higher than the reimbursements of the public health
care systems. As a result, the payments we receive
from private payors contribute a substantial portion
of our profit. In 2017, approximately 42% of our con-
solidated Health care revenues were attributable to
private payors and hospitals in the North America
Segment. If these payors succeed in lowering reim-
bursement rates in the u.s., change the extent or con-
ditions of their networks or if the portion of reim-
bursements by private insurers in general drops, this
could result in a significant reduction in Company
revenue and operating profit. In addition, consolida-
tion among private insurers may have any adverse
impact on our ability to negotiate commercially rea-
sonable rates with such insurers.

We monitor the relationships with private health
insurance companies continuously and try to hedge
the business through long-term contracts to maintain
profitability.

A portion of our patients who are currently cov-
ered by private insurers may elect to transition to
government funded reimbursement programs that
reimburse us at lower rates for our services if efforts
to restrict or eliminate the charitable funding of pa-
tient insurance premiums are successful.

Health care reforms
A number of governments have been considering
proposals to modify their current health care systems
to improve quality of and access to health care and
to control costs. Policymakers in several countries are
also considering reforms that could change the metho-
dology used to reimburse providers of health care
services. Also standards and regulations compulsory
for providing dialysis service can be subject to exten-
sive changes.

In fiscal year 2017, the Company derived approx-
imately 34% of its worldwide revenue from Medicare
and Medicaid reimbursements in the u.s. Consequent-
ly, changes in legislation or reimbursement practices
regarding e.g. the End-Stage Renal Disease Prospec-
tive Payment System, the Physician Fee Schedule, the
Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule and the Ambulatory
Surgical Center Payment System could influence the
volume of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements for
services provided and the insurance coverage.

A decrease in reimbursement rates, covered
services or changes to standards, regulations or
state funding in countries in which the Group oper-
ates, especially significant changes in the u.s. Medi-
care and Medicaid programs could reduce the Com-
pany’s revenue and profitability and have a material
adverse effect on its business, financial condition
and results of operations.

The u.s. administration has publicly announced
its intention to pursue significant changes to exist-
ing health care insurance programs, especially pro-
grams in connection with the Affordable Care Act.
In addition, options to restructure the Medicare
program in the direction of a defined-contribution,
“premium support” model and to shift Medicaid
funding to a block grant or per capita arrangement,
with greater flexibility for the states, are also likely
to be considered.

The u.s. administration also announced its de-
cision to end subsidies, known as cost-sharing reduc-
tion (csr) payments, to health insurance companies
to help pay out-of-pocket costs of low-income Amer-
icans. Some commercial insurers have stated that
they will need much higher premiums and may with-
draw from the insurance exchanges created under
the Affordable Care Act if the subsidies were elimi-
nated. However, in February 2018, the u.s. adminis-
tration appears to have altered course and requested
$1.2BN to fund insurance exchanges, including csr
payments, as part of the administration’s 2019 budget.
A portion of this requested funding is expected to
also fund the dismantling of the insurance exchanges.
We cannot predict whether the inclusion of this fund-
ing in the budget for 2019 will come to pass. As a
result, significant increases in insurance premiums
and a reduction in the availability of insurance
through such exchanges could reduce the number of
our commercially insured patients and shift such pa-
tients to Medicare and Medicaid.

Changes of this nature could have significant
effects on our businesses, both positive and negative,
but the outcomes are impossible to predict.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2017

Risks relating to the
Company's business

Growth

The health care industry experiences continuing con-
solidation particularly among health care providers.
This development could adversely affect the Compa-
ny’s ability to find suitable acquisition targets and to
increase future growth and product sales. Also the
ability to make future acquisitions depends, in part,
on the availability of financial resources and the cur-
rent restrictions imposed by competition laws as well
as existing credit agreements. The integration of ac-
quired businesses may cause problems e. g. by assum-
ing unknown liabilities or non-compliant business
practices not disclosed by the seller or not uncovered
during due diligence. Furthermore the Company’s
business could be affected adversely by the failure to
receive or the loss of required licenses, certifications,
or other regulatory approvals for operation of dialysis
clinics or sale of equipment, products or services.

Competitors
The Company faces numerous competitors in both its
health care services and dialysis products business.
Technological innovation has historically been a sig-
nificant competitive factor in the dialysis products
business. The introduction of new products or ser-
vices by competitors could render one or more of the
Company's products or services less competitive or
even obsolete and thus materially adversely affect the
future pricing and sale of its products and services.
This also includes the launch by competitors of gener-
ic drugs or pharmaceuticals protected by patents,
which could affect the Company's sales and distribu-
tion of pharmaceuticals for which, to some extent,
the Company is obligated to make certain minimum
annual royalty payments.

To ensure our permanent competitiveness, we
work closely together with physicians and scientists.
Important technological and pharmaceutical innova-
tions are intended to be quickly identified and fur-
ther developed, if necessary also by adapting our
business strategy. Moreover we secure our competi-
tiveness by ongoing analyzes of our market environ-
ment as well as the regulatory framework. The mar-
ket activity, especially our competitors’ products and
newly launched dialysis-related products are thor-
oughly monitored. The cooperation between the
various technical, medical and academic institutions
within our company also ensures our competitive-
ness, which is finally further enhanced by our conse-
quent conduction of programs devoted to cost saving
and efficiency increase.

Research and development

The development of new products and therapies pro-
poses a risk that the desired development goal will
not be achieved or achieved significantly later than
planned. Costly and extensive preclinical and clinical
examinations are necessary until admission. All prod-
ucts, packaging, applications and technologies are
constantly and systematically monitored, tested and
improved. We address potential risks in the area of
research and development (R&D) by continually ana-
lyzing, evaluating and assessing whether the R&D proj-
ects fit into the overall strategy of Fresenius Medical
Care. As a vertically integrated company, we also
benefit from direct contact with our patients and
medical professionals. Due to this close proximity to
the market, we have the potential to gather import-
ant information to develop and offer products and
therapies that meet the needs of our customers.

Referral practices

The Company's dialysis services business is dependent
upon patients choosing the Company’s facilities as
the location for their treatments. Patients may select
a facility based, in whole or in part, on the recom-
mendation of their physician. If a significant number
of physicians, hospitals or other health care institu-
tions cease referring their patients to the Company's
facilities or stop purchasing or prescribing the Com-
pany’s dialysis products, this could result in loss of
revenue.

Patents

One of the typical patent risks faced by the Company
is inadequate protection in the form of patents for
technologies and products developed by the Compa-
ny. This means that competitors could copy the Com-
pany’s products without incurring comparable devel-
opment costs. In addition, the Company could
infringe the patent of a competitor and thus be liable
for damages; this could result in a ban on the Com-
pany further selling the affected product. An inade-
quate protection of the Company's patents could
have an adverse impact on the Company's financial
condition and results of operations.


--- Page 50 ---

Procurement
The Company's business is dependent on the reliable
supply of several raw materials for production and
service purposes. If the Company is unable to coun-
teract the risk of bottleneck situations at times of
limited availability of materials this could result in
delays in production and service and hence have an
adverse effect on the Company's results of opera-
tions. Similarly, price increases by suppliers could also
adversely affect the Company's results of operations.

Our purchasing strategy is aimed at developing
partnerships with strategic suppliers through long-
term contracts and at the same time ensuring that we
have at least two sources for all supply and price-criti-
cal primary products (dual sourcing, multiple sourc-
ing). To prevent loss of suppliers, we monitor our
supplier relationships on a regular basis. Suppliers
which are integral to our procurement functions are
also subject to performance- and risk-analyzes as well
as a continuous supply chain monitoring. Through
constant market analyzes, a demands-based design
of supplier-relationships and -contracts, as well as the
use of financial instruments, possible price increases
can be partially mitigated. We benefit from interna-
tional price advantages and are able to mitigate pro-
curement risks associated with currency fluctuations
or with a dependency on individual suppliers through
the intensive regional cooperation of our procure-
ment teams.

Personnel
The Company's continued growth in the health care
business will depend upon the ability to attract and
retain skilled employees, such as highly skilled nurses
and other medical personnel. Competition for those
employees is intense and the current nursing short-
age has increased the Company's personnel and re-
cruiting costs. Moreover, the Company considers that
future success in the provider business depends on
the ability to attract and retain qualified physicians to
serve as employees of or consultants to the Compa-
ny’s health care services businesses. The Company's
health care products business depends on the devel-
opment of new products, technologies and treatment
concepts to be competitive. Competition is also in-
tense for skilled engineers and other technical re-
search and development personnel. Additionally, in
recruiting, employing and retaining personnel we
have to observe various labor related laws and asso-
ciated practices.

If the Company is unable to recruit and retain
qualified personnel, this could have an adverse im-
pact on its ability to manage future growth and on
new or continued product development. Also chang-
es in or the disregard of labor related laws and asso-
ciated practices could have an adverse effect on our
profitability.

Corruption and fraud
The Company operates many facilities and engages
with other business associates to help it carry out its
health care activities. In such a decentralized system,
it is difficult to maintain the desired level of oversight
and control over the thousands of persons employed
by many affiliated companies and its business associ-
ates. Training, oversight and compliance programs
cannot assure protection from deliberate, reckless or
inadvertent acts of employees that violate the Com-
pany’s compliance policies or anti-corruption laws.
Such violations could disrupt the Company's business
and result in a material adverse effect on results of
operations or financial condition.

Beginning in 2012, the Company received cer-
tain communications alleging conduct in countries
outside the u.s. that might violate the FcPA or other
anti-bribery laws. Since that time, the Company’s Su-
pervisory Board, through its Audit and Corporate
Governance Committee, has conducted investiga-
tions with the assistance of independent counsel. In
a continuing dialogue, the Company voluntarily ad-
vised the u.s. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) and the u.s. Department of Justice (DOJ) about
these investigations, while the sec and DoJ (collective-
ly the “government” or “government agencies”) have
conducted their own investigations, in which the
Company has cooperated.

In the course of this dialogue, the Company has
identified and reported to the government, and has
taken remedial actions including employee disci-
plinary actions with respect to, conduct that might
result in the government agencies’ seeking monetary
penalties or other sanctions against the Company
under the FcPA or other anti-bribery laws and impact
adversely the Company's ability to conduct business
in certain jurisdictions. The Company has recorded in
prior periods a non-material accrual for certain ad-
verse impacts that were identified.

The Company has substantially concluded its
investigations and undertaken discussions toward a
possible settlement with the government agencies
that would avoid litigation over government de-
mands related to certain identified conduct. These
discussions are continuing and have not yet achieved
an agreement-in-principle; failure to reach agree-
ment and consequent litigation with either or both
government agencies remains possible. The discus-
sions have revolved around possible bribery and cor-
ruption questions principally related to certain con-
duct in the Company's products business in a number
of countries.

The Company has recorded a charge of €200M
in the accompanying financial statements. The
charge is based on ongoing settlement negotiations
that would avoid litigation between the Company
and the government agencies and represents an es-
timate from a range of potential outcomes estimated

RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES REPORT

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2017

from current discussions. The charge encompasses
government agencies claims for profit disgorgement,
as well as accruals for fines or penalties, certain legal
expenses and other related costs or asset impair-
ments.

The Company continues to implement en-
hancements to its anti-corruption compliance pro-
gram, including internal controls related to compli-
ance with international anti-bribery laws. The
Company continues to be fully committed to FcPA
and other anti-bribery law compliance.

Information systems

and business processes
As the Company continues to grow and introduces
more international operations, the processes within
the Company are increasingly complex. Accordingly,
it is more and more dependent on information and
communication technologies and -systems to struc-
ture its processes and harmonize them between dif-
ferent regions. An insufficient design of those systems
and business processes could lead to non-availability
of certain information, causing inefficient workflows,
deficient internal and external communication and
intransparencies regarding operations. A breakdown
of these systems could temporarily lead to standstill
of parts of our business and consequently cause
heavy damages.

Additionally, cyber-attacks or privacy and data
breaches could result in the misappropriation or com-
promise of sensitive information. We gather and han-
dle personal data of our patients in many regions of
the world and thus need to adhere to various data
protection and privacy regulations. Any loss, imper-
missible use, access or disclosure of this sensitive in-
formation or non-compliance with data protection
and privacy related laws, regulations and standards
could threat our position in competition, our reputa-
tion as well as our whole business.

Using its Information Security Management
System (isms), which is based on the internationally
recognized security standard Iso 27002, the security
guidelines and processes within the Company are
enhanced continuously. Business data is backed up
regularly and disaster recovery plans, which are reg-
ularly tested and improved, are in place. The Compa-
ny operates three data centers at geographically sep-
arate locations to maximize the availability and data
security of IT systems. A mirrored infrastructure that
creates a copy of critical systems is in use. In general,
we continue to enhance our internal information and
reporting systems to ensure that their structure meets
evolving needs.

Furthermore, among others, company guide-
lines relating to data protection and _ privacy,
which also regulate the assignment of access rights
and third-party collaboration, must be considered,
trainings for employees are conducted and

governance structures are continuously adapted.
Compliance is monitored with controls including
those relating to Section 404 of sox. Operational and
security audits are carried out every year both inter-
nally and by external auditors.

The existing IT security architecture with differ-
ent layers of security measures protects the systems
in our data centers. The access to sensitive or critical
data from outside of the secured data center net-
works is protected by the usage of secure protocols
and cryptographic measures. Besides that, annual
penetration tests for applications with critical data
(e.g. patient or personnel data) are conducted.

Other risks

Liquidity and financing
The liquidity risk is defined as the risk that a compa-
ny is potentially unable to meet its financial obliga-
tions. The Management Board of the Company man-
ages the liquidity of the Group by means of effective
working capital and cash management as well as an
anticipatory evaluation of refinancing alternatives.
The Management of the Company believes that ex-
isting credit facilities, cash flow from operating ac-
tivities and additional short-term borrowings are
sufficient to meet the Company's foreseeable de-
mand for liquidity.

At December 31, 2017 respectively December 31,
2016, the Group had financial debt of €7.45 BN respec-
tively €8.13 BN. The Company's credit agreements and
notes include covenants that that require maintaining
certain financial ratios or meeting other financial tests.
The covenants also restrict the Company's ability to
dispose of assets, incur debt, pay dividends and other
restricted payments, create liens or make investments
or acquisitions. The breach of any of the covenants
could result in a default and acceleration of payments
of the indebtedness, which would have an adverse
effect on the Company's business, financial condition
and results of operations. The Company considers
itself able to maintain the required financial ratios at
present and in the near future.

Currencies and interests
The Company actively manages foreign currency and
interest rate exposures that are part of its normal
business activities. Risk management procedures for
foreign currencies and interest rate exposures are
based on strategies defined and, if necessary, adapt-
ed in close cooperation with the Management Board,
including, for example, guidelines that cover all steps
and levels of the risk management process. They de-
fine responsibilities for the determination of risks, the
careful use of financial instruments for hedging pur-
poses and for accurate financial reporting. The use of
derivative instruments is restricted to micro hedges
which are used in order to hedge exposures that arise


--- Page 52 ---

in the ordinary course of business. The Company does
not enter into transactions for trading or other specu-
lative purposes. The Company enters into transac-
tions with banks, which generally have ratings in the
“a” Category or better, as approved by the Manage-
ment Board. The effectiveness of the hedging rela-
tionships of the hedging instruments and the hedged
items is tested on a quarterly basis.

The Company enters into derivatives, particular-
ly interest rate swaps and to a certain extent, interest
rate options to protect against the risk of rising inter-
est rates. These interest rate derivatives are designat-
ed as cash flow hedges and have been entered into
in order to effectively convert payments based on
variable interest rates into payments at a fixed inter-
est rate. The euro-denominated interest rate swaps
expire in 2019 and have an interest rate of 0.32%. As
of December 31, 2017 respectively December 31, 2016,
the notional amount of the euro-denominated inter-
est rate swaps in place was €228 M respectively €252 M.

Derivative foreign currency contracts are en-
tered into for the purpose of limiting the exchange
rate exposure from sales and purchases as well as
lendings and borrowings between the Company's
subsidiaries located in different countries and report-
ing in different currencies. A large portion of the
transaction exposures arise from sales of products
from the Company's subsidiaries in the euro region
to other international business units. The aggregate
notional amount of foreign currency hedge contracts
as of December 31, 2017 was €756M, primarily for
hedging euro exposure to the u.s. dollar and various
other currencies. Economic hedges, which are used
by the Company, are accounted for as recognized
hedges in the consolidated financial statements,
when necessary.

The estimation and quantification of transac-
tion risks from foreign currencies are determined ac-
cording to the statistical model Cash Flow at Risk
(CFaR). CFaR indicates the maximum amount of a
potential loss of the forecasted foreign exchange
cash flow of the next twelve months that occurs with
a probability of 95%. As of December 31, 2017, the
Company’s CFaR amounts to €50.8M ($60.9 M).

Further information on market, default and li-
quidity risks is included in note 23 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements.

Litigation and other exposures

Risks associated with investigations and litigations
are continuously identified, assessed and reported
within the Company. The Company is involved in var-
ious legal proceedings and investigations resulting
from its business operations. A negative outcome of
these legal proceedings or investigations leading to
legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on
the Company's financial condition and results of op-
erations.

External legal consulting support is always used
to defend the Company against risks associated with
litigations. If necessary, accounting measures like ac-
cruals are used.

For the matters in which the Company believes
a loss is both reasonably possible and assessable, an
estimate of the loss or range of loss exposure is pro-
vided in note 22 of the notes to the consolidated finan-
cial statements. For other proceedings, the Company
believes that the loss probability is remote and/or the
loss or range of possible losses cannot be reasonably
estimated at this time.

For details on ongoing proceedings and further
information on material legal risks to which the Com-
pany is exposed, reference is made to note 22 of the
notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Taxes
The Company is subject to ongoing tax audits in var-
ious jurisdictions. The Company could potentially re-
ceive notices of unfavorable adjustments and disal-
lowances in connection with certain of these audits.
If the Company is unsuccessful in contesting unfavor-
able determinations we could be required to make
additional tax payments, which could have a materi-
al adverse impact on our business, financial condition
and results of operations in the relevant reporting
period.

In general, tax-relevant issues are, as necessary,
coordinated with internal tax expert regarding com-
pliance with the according tax laws. If necessary,
statements and opinions by external consultants are
obtained to minimize tax risks.

International operations

The Company operates dialysis clinics in around 50

countries and sells a range of equipment, products

and services to customers in around 150 countries.

The Company's international operations are subject

to a number of risks, including the following:

> The Company could face difficulties in enforcing
and collecting accounts receivable under some
countries’ legal systems.

> The Company could be negatively impacted by
the ability of certain countries to service their
sovereign debt obligations.

> Local regulations could restrict the Company's
ability to obtain a direct ownership interest in
dialysis clinics or other operations.

> Some countries or economic unions may im-
pose charges or restrictions, such as local con-
tent requirements, which restrict the importa-
tion of our products.

> The withdrawal of individual states from feder-
ations or multinational agreements and the as-
sociated effects on tax, exchange rate, legal,
and regulatory conditions could make our ac-
tivities there more difficult or negatively affect
their results.

FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE 2017

Any one or more of these or other factors could in-
crease the Company’s costs, reduce revenues, or dis-
rupt operations, with possible material adverse ef-
fects on the Company's business, results of operations
and financial condition.

Developments of this nature are continuously
monitored and analyzed and response measures like
the extension of local production capacities, the
adaption of product designs, organizational changes
and various others are set in place based on case by
case decisions.

Unpredictable events
Fresenius Medical Care operates dialysis facilities or
manufacturing facilities in many regions of the world,
with diverse geographic, societal and economic con-
ditions. Unforeseeable events such as natural disas-
ters, terrorist attacks or political instability, could af-
fect our services and our ability to deliver in a limited
time and place.

Through forward-looking planning and preven-
tion programs, Fresenius Medical Care is trying to
limit possible effects of such events already in ad-
vance. In addition, to maintain operations in the
event of an onset and to reduce potential impact on
our patients and the organization, we have spare ca-
pacity and safety stock of certain resources as well as
emergency and recovery plans in place. Residual risks
are eventually covered when necessary and expedient
by taking out insurance.

Global economic conditions

and disruptions in financial markets
The Company is dependent on the conditions of the
financial markets and the global economy. In order to
pursue its business, the Company is reliant on capital,
as are its renal product customers and commercial
health care insurers. Limited or more expensive ac-
cess to capital in the financial markets could adverse-
ly affect the Company's business.

The global recovery from the financial crisis
continues. This development is accompanied by un-
expected interferences like emerging geopolitical
conflicts in several regions. Thus, the overall global
economic outlook remains uncertain and current eco-
nomic conditions could adversely affect the Compa-
ny’s business and profitability. Potential decline in
revenues may create additional pressures to contain
or reduce reimbursements for the Company's services
from public payors, including Medicare and Medicaid
in the u.s. and other government sponsored pro-
grams in the United States and other countries
around the world. Increasing job losses or changes in
the unemployment rate in the u.s. may result in a
smaller percentage of the Company's patients being
covered by an employer group health plan and a larg-
er percentage being covered by lower paying Medi-
care and Medicaid programs. To the extent that pay-
ors are negatively impacted by a decline in the
economy, the Company may experience further pres-
sure on commercial rates, a further slowdown in col-
lections and a reduction in the amounts it expects to
collect. Devaluation of currencies and worsening eco-
nomic conditions, including inflationary cost increas-
es in various markets in connection with deteriorating
country ratings also increase the risk of a goodwill
impairment, which could lead to a partial or a total
goodwill write off in the affected cash generating
units. If the global economic conditions continue or
worsen, the Company’s financial cost could increase,
its financial flexibility could be limited and its results
of operations could be adversely affected. The Com-
pany believes to be well positioned to continue to
grow its business while meeting its financial obliga-
tions.

Changes in the risk situation

Fresenius Medical Care operates in a constantly
changing environment. Accordingly, the risk situation
is also subject to constant change. In the past finan-
cial year, two new risk areas were identified, which
complete the overall picture of the risk situation:

Due to the increasingly volatile social and polit-
ical conditions in some regions of the world as well
as recent natural disasters in the u.s., the consider-
ation of risks from events of this kind (21) comple-
ments the overall picture of the risk situation.

The fundamental structure of the dialysis mar-
ket and continued consolidation in the health care
industry, as well as associated developments within
and outside the u.s., are leading to a focused consid-
eration of risks arising from the composition of our
customer base (4).

With regard to the classification of the risks in
terms of probability and potential impact, the follow-
ing significant changes occurred compared to the
previous year:

With regard to the one-year forecast period,
the risk regarding u.s. federal health care programs
(3) has decreased due to expanded experience.

With regard to the five-year period, there were
significant changes regarding several risks:

The risks of non-compliant behavior (14) have
increased to medium risks due to the potentially in-
creased impact.

Increased competition for skilled workers in
many regions where we offer our services and man-
ufacture our products leads to an increased medium
risk in terms of personnel (13).

Additionally launched projects in the field of
process design as well as data protection and data
security reduce the risk regarding information sys-
tems and business processes (15) to a low risk.

The risk in the area of research and develop-
ment (9) has increased to a medium risk due to in-
creasingly dynamic market demands and circum-
stances.

Due to improvements in quality management,
the risk regarding adherence to quality and regulato-
ry requirements (1&2) is now considered low in the
medium term.

OPPORTUNITIES
MANAGEMENT

OPPORTUNITIES MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM

As much of our business is organized regionally, we
can identify industry-specific trends and requirements
as well as the resultant opportunities in the different
regions at an early stage and gear our actions to
them. We also perform comprehensive quantitative
and qualitative analyses to enable us to capture busi-
ness opportunities. This involves systematically eval-
uating relevant market data, closely examining re-
search projects and taking general social trends into
consideration. Our analyses focus on general eco-
nomic, industry-specific, regional and local develop-
ments as well as regulatory changes. In addition,
close cooperation between our Strategy and Plan-
ning departments and the managers of other depart-
ments allows us to identify global opportunities as
early as possible.

OPPORTUNITIES

As a vertically integrated dialysis company, Fresenius
Medical Care can offer almost all of the products and
services that a patient with chronic kidney failure re-
quires for treatment. Our 3,752 dialysis clinics in
around 50 countries constitute the largest and most
international network of this kind in the world. As a
result, we possess valuable dialysis expertise that is
unique in the industry. Thanks to this wealth of expe-
rience, we know that high-quality is not only the key
to a better quality of life for patients, but can also
make a significant contribution to reducing the costs
of health care. Based on this understanding and our
business model, major opportunities arise that could
have a positive impact on the results of operations,
financial position and net assets of Fresenius Medical
Care as things stand today.

Industry-specific opportunities

Patient growth and

demographic development
The dialysis market is a growth market that is largely
unaffected by macroeconomic influences. According
to estimates, the number of people worldwide suf-
fering from chronic kidney failure and requiring dial-
ysis treatment is rising at a relatively constant rate of
around 6% annually. It is expected to reach more than
3.4M patients in 2018 and approximately 4.9m by
2025 — see chart 2.33 on page 72. Social trends contribute
to this rise in patient numbers. In Europe and the u.s.
in particular, they include the aging population and
the increasing incidence of diabetes and hyperten-
sion, two illnesses that frequently precede the onset

of end-stage renal disease. In developing and emerg-
ing countries, the growing population and gradually
improved access to dialysis as a result of increasing
wealth are key factors that further boost demand for
dialysis products and services. We want to continue
to make a significant contribution to meeting this
demand in the future.

Changes in legal and political conditions
To what extent private companies can offer dialysis
treatment and in what form depends on the health
care system of the country in which they operate or
wish to access and its legal framework. For Fresenius
Medical Care, opportunities to tap into new markets
or to expand its market share arise if a country opens
up to private dialysis providers. These decisions are
also increasingly influenced by the following factors:
> Health care systems are under pressure to de-
liver ever more comprehensive medical care
(longer life expectancy, increase in concomitant
diseases, fully-functioning health care provision
still being established).
> Dialysis is a complex life-sustaining procedure,
which places high demands on health care sys-
tems in terms of expertise and efficiency. There-
fore, public health care providers are increasingly
looking for solutions involving private providers.

One example is Germany, the seventh-largest market
worldwide in terms of the number of dialysis patients.
We lead the market here with our products. Dialysis
clinics in Germany are operated predominantly by

physicians in private practice, hospitals, and non-
profit organizations; however, for a number of years,
Fresenius Medical Care has also offered dialysis ser-
vices in outpatient medical care centers. At the end
of 2017, we were involved in 40 care centers (2016: 31).
As an experienced partner, we want to continue to
support our customers in setting up new structures
in the German health care system and take advantage
of the opportunity to strengthen our business in the
long term.

Public-private partnerships

In some countries, public-private partnerships (PPP)
are an attractive business model for Fresenius
Medical Care. These are contractually defined pro-
ject alliances between the public sector and private
companies in which both partners share the financ-
ing, tasks, risks and opportunities of a project. Our
extensive dialysis expertise gives us a competitive
edge here, as it enables us to flexibly offer various
levels of care for hospitals, health insurers, local or
national authorities. Depending on the contract, we
set up new dialysis clinics and install the equipment,
train medical personnel in quality, hygiene and nu-
trition, or manage the clinics ourselves on the terms
agreed. This enables the public sector to care for
more patients more effectively and less expensively.

Growing demand for

integrated health care
As a result of increasing cost pressure and the grow-
ing number of patients, there is now greater global
demand for a holistic (integrated) health care con-
cept for patients with chronic kidney failure. This in-
volves combining all health care services and thera-
pies associated with the treatment of a kidney patient
to create a holistic program tailored to the patient's
individual needs and the requirements of the health
insurer. Depending on the contract and the structure
of the health care system, dialysis can be supplement-
ed by medical tests, drugs for kidney patients and
vascular access management, for example. Compre-
hensive care from a single source is aimed at improv-
ing the way in which the different stages of treatment
are coordinated and controlled, minimizing compli-
cations and thereby avoiding additional stays in hos-
pital as far as possible. It increases the patient's qual-
ity of life and the quality of treatment, while reducing
the overall costs of the treatment.

Fresenius Medical Care is particularly well
placed to offer integrated, high-quality treatment
programs for chronically ill kidney patients for sever-
al reasons: As a manufacturer of market-leading di-
alysis products and an operator of the largest global
dialysis clinic network, we have long-standing expe-
rience in providing comprehensive care for dialysis
patients. Thanks to the high-quality and reliability of
our products and services, we enjoy an excellent rep-
utation in the industry. In addition, we use sophisti-
cated internal feedback instruments to measure and
compare the success of treatment at our clinics and
to rapidly identify any potential for improvement.

Beyond our core business with dialysis products
and the treatment of dialysis patients, we offer addi-
tional medical services that we combine under Care
Coordination. These include vascular care and medi-
cation management for patients with kidney disease,
as well as our laboratory and pharmacy business. This
provides us with significant opportunities for the fu-
ture. We plan to expand these services further in the
coming years.

Opportunities related to
our business operations

New products and technologies
If patient numbers grow as strongly as anticipated,
cost pressure continues to rise, and clinics reach full
capacity, home therapies are expected to take on a
more crucial role in dialysis. This scenario presents us
with opportunities for growth. Home dialysis as well
as associated technologies and products will there-
fore continue to be a key focal point of our R&D ac-
tivities. One major aim here is to give patients the
greatest possible independence and mobility with a
dialysis machine that is resource-efficient and can be

used flexibly. We will continue to add innovative
products and technologies to our range in the future
to capture growth opportunities and meet the de-
mand for integrated care as effectively as possible.

Internal organization and procedures
Fresenius Medical Care benefits from a number of
long-term opportunities in the way it organizes and
designs its business operations. For example, we use
the Lean Six Sigma management method to analyze
and better coordinate our production processes
worldwide with the aim of reducing both our defect
rates and manufacturing cycles. In addition, we are
systematically expanding environmental management
at our production sites and clinics to improve our op-
erating efficiency, for instance by saving resources.

Capital expenditure and acquisitions
We evaluate ideas for growth initiatives generated
from market analyses as part of our annual budget
planning, or more frequently if necessary. We man-
age the investments required for implementing pro-
jects using a detailed coordination and evaluation
process. The Management Board sets the investment
budget for the Group as well as the focus of invest-
ment. Before realizing investment projects, an inter-
nal committee examines the individual projects and
measures, taking into account their yield require-
ments and potential return on investment. Projects
are only undertaken if they help to increase the Com-
pany’s value.

We are investing in our future growth by ex-
panding our health care services business through
acquisitions and purchasing expertise and relevant
technologies in the area of R&D. Through close col-
laboration between our Strategy and Planning de-
partments and the managers responsible for our ac-
quisitions, we are able to identify suitable potential
purchases worldwide at an early stage.

Fresenius Medical Care's business model

Our business model itself also provides opportunities
for Fresenius Medical Care’s future growth. As a ver-
tically integrated dialysis company, we not only offer
almost all of the products and services that a patient
with chronic kidney failure requires for treatment, but
also use these on a daily basis in our own clinics. As
a result, we can incorporate the feedback from our
patients, physicians and nurses worldwide in devel-
oping and manufacturing new products as well as in
organizing our clinic management. This gives us a
crucial competitive edge.

ASSESSMENT OF THE
OVERALL RISK
POSITION AND THE
OPPORTUNITIES

BY THE MANAGEMENT

The implemented risk management system forms the
basis for the assessment of the overall risk position
of the Group. The overall risk position of Fresenius
Medical Care is determined by the individual risks de-
scribed before. Changes in the risk situation of the
Group compared to the previous reporting period
occurred as stated in the correspondent paragraph
on page 71. There are currently no risks identified that
could endanger the continued existence of Fresenius
Medical Care. As part of the enterprise-wide review
of the integrated management system, the effective-
ness of the risk management system is monitored
and where necessary improvements are made. The
Management Board will continue to expand our risk
management as well as the review of the related
management system to be able to identify, explore
and evaluate potential risks more quickly and then
initiate appropriate countermeasures. We believe that
we have made all necessary organizational steps to
recognize potential risks early and to respond appro-
priately to these.

We remain confident that our integrated global
business model and our earning power provide us
with a sound basis for our business development, al-
lowing us to capture potential arising for the Compa-
ny. In view of our leading position in the dialysis mar-
ket, our innovative strength, our committed staff, and
our structured processes for identifying risks early on
and managing opportunities, we firmly believe that
we can continue to make the most of any opportuni-
ties that arise for our business in a responsible manner.

TAKEOVER-RELATED
DISCLOSURES

Share capital held by the Company's shareholders
(excluding treasury shares held by the Company) at
December 31, 2017 totals approximately €306 mM, divid-
ed into 306,451,049 non-par bearer shares, each arith-
metically representing €1 of the share capital. The
total of non-par bearer shares include 41,769 shares
issued to Company employees in 2017 in conjunction
with a corporate agreement and which are subject to
a two-year holding period. On the basis of the autho-
rization granted by the Company's Annual General
Meeting on May 12, 2011 to conduct a share buy-back
program, the Company repurchased 7,548,951 shares
in 2013. The Company retired 6,549,000 of these repur-
chased shares on February 16, 2016 in order to de-
crease its share capital. On the basis of the authori-
zation granted by the Company’s Annual General
Meeting on May 12, 2016 to conduct a share buy-back
program, the Company repurchased 660,000 shares,
between December 11, 2017, and December 21, 2017.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company therefore holds
1,659,951 treasury shares. Treasury shares held corres-
pond to approximately €1.7M or 0.54% of the Com-
pany’s share capital. Voting rights may not be exer-
cised on treasury shares. The treasury shares were
acquired on the stock exchange via the XETRA trading
system in conjunction with a share buy-back program.
Including treasury shares, the Company share capital
therefore amounted to €308M at December 31, 2017,
divided into 308,111,000 shares. The acquired treasury

shares will only be used to reduce the Company's
share capital (by cancellation of the relevant shares)
or to service employee incentive plans.

The rights of the shareholders are governed by
the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the
Company's Articles of Association. This stipulates that
each share shall be entitled to one vote at the Com-
pany’s Annual General Meeting.

The General Partner, Fresenius Medical Care
Management AG, is responsible for managing and
representing the Company. Similarly, it does not par-
ticipate in the profit or loss or net assets of the Com-
pany. The General Partner's management authority
also encompasses exceptional management mea-
sures, which do not require approval by the share-
holders. Vis-a-vis the General Partner, the Company
is represented by its Supervisory Board.

The General Partner will cease to be General
Partner of the Company if and when all shares in the
General Partner entity are no longer held directly or
indirectly by one party, which at the same time must
hold, directly or indirectly by means of a controlled
company as defined by sec. 17 para. 1 AktG, more than
25% of the Company's share capital. This does not
apply if all the shares of the General Partner entity are
held directly or indirectly by the Company. Addition-
ally, the General Partner will cease to be the Compa-
ny’s General Partner if the shares in the General Part-
ner entity are acquired by another person
> who does not at the same time acquire shares

of the Company in the amount of more than

25% of the Company's capital or
> who has not, within three months after the ef-

fectiveness of such acquisition, submitted a
voluntary or mandatory takeover offer to the
Company’s shareholders according to the rules
of the German Securities Acquisition and Take-
over Act (WpUG); the fair consideration offered
to the shareholders must also reflect the con-
sideration which the purchaser pays for the
shares in the General Partner entity, if the
amount for such consideration is above the
amount of its equity capital.

The other grounds for withdrawal as provided by the
law remain unaffected with respect to the General
Partner.

As at December 31, 2017, Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA,
Bad Homburg v.d. Hohe, Germany holds 94,380,382
shares of the Company, corresponding to 30.63%
holding and hence in excess of 10% of the Company's
total share capital. After deduction of treasury shares
held by the Company in accordance with sec. 16
para. 2 HGB sentence 2 AktG, Fresenius se & Co. KGaA
holds 30.80% of the Company's voting rights.

The appointment and removal of members of
the Management Board of the General Partner entity
are governed by sec. 84 and sec. 85 AktG. Changes
in the Articles of Association of the company must
be made in accordance with sec. 278 para. 3 AktG,

sec. 179 AktG in conjunction with sec. 133 AktG. The
Articles of Association entitle the Company's Super-
visory Board, without resolution of the General Meet-
ing, to make amendments to the Articles of Associa-
tion which concern only its wording.

The General Partner is entitled, subject to ap-
proval by the Supervisory Board, to increase the Com-
pany’s share capital as follows in accordance with the
resolutions passed by the shareholders’ at the Gen-
eral Meeting:
> Authorization, in the period up to May 18, 2020

to increase, on one or more occasions, the

Company's share capital by up to a total of

€35M by issuing new bearer ordinary shares in

return for cash contributions (Authorized Cap-

ital 2015/1).
> Authorization, in the period up to May 18, 2020

to increase, on one or more occasions, the

Company's share capital by up to a total of

€25M by issuing new bearer ordinary shares in

return for cash and/or non-cash contributions

(Authorized Capital 2015/11).

In both cases, the General Partner is entitled, under

certain circumstances and with the approval of the

Supervisory Board, to decide on the exclusion of

shareholders’ pre-emption rights.
In addition to the above, the following condi-

tional capitals are in place:

> A conditional increase of up to €3.374M. This
conditional increase in capital will only be car-
ried out to the extent that convertible bonds
were issued in accordance with the Internation-
al Employee Participation Scheme in accordance
with the shareholders’ resolutions taken on
May 23, 2001 and May 16, 2013 and the holders
of such convertible bonds exercise their conver-
sion rights. With effect from December 2015, no
exercisable option or convertible bonds are out-
standing.

> A conditional increase of up to €3.513M. This
conditional share capital increase will only be
carried out to the extent that options were is-
sued in accordance with the Stock Option Plan
2006 based on the shareholders’ resolutions
taken on May 9, 2006 and May 15, 2007, the
holders of such options exercise their rights and
the Company does not issue any own (treasury)
shares to settle the options; in the case of op-
tions issued to members of the Management
Board of the General Partner entity, the Super-
visory Board of that entity shall be responsible.

> A conditional increase of up to €10.916M. This
conditional share capital increase will only be
carried out to the extent that options were is-
sued in accordance with the Stock Option Plan
2011 based on the shareholders’ resolutions tak-
en on May 12, 2011 and May 12, 2016, the holders
of such options exercise their rights and the
Company does not issue any own (treasury)

shares to settle the options; in the case of op-
tions issued to members of the Management
Board of the General Partner entity, the Super-
visory Board of that entity shall be responsible.

In accordance with the resolution taken at the Annu-
al General Meeting on May 12, 2016, the general part-
ner is authorized to acquire treasury shares up to
May 11, 2021 and up to a maximum of 10% of the
share capital in place at the date of the resolution. At
no stage shall the acquired shares together with oth-
er treasury shares held by the Company or attribut-
able to pursuant to sec. 71a ff. AktG exceed 10% of
the Company's share capital. The acquisition can be
made via the stock exchange or by means of a public
invitation to submit offers for sale. The authorization
may not be used for the purposes of trading in its
own shares. The general partner is authorized to use
the shares of the Company acquired on the basis of
this or an earlier authorization for all legally admissi-
ble purposes, in particular (1) to withdraw them from
circulation without any requirement for a further res-
olution to be taken at the Annual General Meeting,
(il) to sell them to third parties in return for contribu-
tions in kind, (111) rather than using conditional capital,
to issue use them to employees of the Company and
its affiliates (including to members of the executive
managements of affiliates) and to use them to service
rights or commitments to acquire shares of the Com-
pany and (iv) to service bonds with option or conver-
sion rights issued by the Company or by dependent
companies as defined by sec. 17 AktG.

A change of control resulting from a takeover
offer could, under certain circumstances, have an im-
pact on several of the Company's long-term financing
arrangements, in which market standard change of
control clauses are in place. These clauses give credi-
tors the right to call for early repayment of outstand-
ing amounts in the event of a change in control. In
most of these financing agreements — in particular in
case of the bonds which are placed in the capital
markets — the right to terminate only exists, however,
if the change of control involves the Company’s rat-
ing or the corresponding financing instrument being
downgraded.
