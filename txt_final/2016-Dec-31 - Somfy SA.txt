MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

TO THE COMBINED GENERAL MEETING OF 17 MAY 201717

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In accordance with legal and regulatory provisions in force, the Management Board has convened you here in order to inform you on
the management of your company and its subsidiaries and to submit for your approval the financial statements for the year ended

31 December 2016.

Somfy Group is the global leader in opening and closing automation for both residential and commercial buildings, and a key player in the

connected home.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR

GIGA

At the end of 2015, Somfy SA decided to sell the shares held in
Giga back to the Gouvéa family.

At 31 December 2015, the financial statements of the Giga entity
were treated in accordance with IFRS 5. Balance sheet items
were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale and income
statement and cash flow statement items were not restated. In
addition, a provision for writedown was recognised to cover the
estimated risk.

An agreement was signed on 30 May 2016, providing for the sale
of the shares for a token price and the disposal of all loans granted
by the Group to Giga of €4.6 million for €1.2 million. Given the
writedown recognised in 2015, the disposal had a €0.3 million
positive impact on net profit for the year to 31 December 2016.

ACQUISITION OF MYFOX

On 27 October 2016, Somfy SA acquired the entire share

capital of Myfox, the Toulouse-based specialist in the design,

development and marketing of connected home security solutions

(alarm systems, security cameras and related services), from the

company’s founding family and investors.

Myfox addresses a customer base of specialist superstores (Leroy

Merlin, Fnac, Castorama, etc.), professionals and individuals

(online shopping sites).

The transaction marks an important stage as the Somfy Group

takes its digital strategy to the next level and consolidates its

positioning as a key player in the connected home market.

The financial flows resulting from the acquisition are detailed as

follows:

— Acquisition on 27 October 2016 of all Myfox SAS shares for a
token price of €1,

— Concurrent increase of €8 million in the share capital of Myfox
SAS,

— Recognition of earnout totalling €20.1 million (payable in 2018
and 2021) calculated on performance parameters (sales, EBITDA
and net debt).

14

Myfox has been fully consolidated since the acquisition date
(October 2016) and contributed sales of €1.3 million and a current
operating loss of €1.1 million. Provisional goodwill is €24.1 million.
Purchase price allocation will take place in 2017.

ACQUISITION OF IHOME

On 2 December 2016, Somfy Group acquired 51% of the share
capital of iHome Systems for €1.9 million. This holding company is
based in Hong Kong and also owns three subsidiaries established
in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.

iHome Group is an integrator of residential automation solutions
for luxury condominiums and villas: lighting, curtains, access
controls, air conditioning, sound systems, home cinemas, etc.

The transaction includes mutual put and call options which will
allow the Group to acquire an additional stake of 29% in 2021 and
the balance of 20% in 2026. A debt relating to these put options
has been recognised for €1.9 million in Group reserves.

Entities of iHome Group have been fully consolidated since
the acquisition date (December 2016). Provisional goodwill is
€1.5 million. Purchase price allocation will take place in 2017.

OTHER CHANGES IN GROUP STRUCTURE

Apart from the transactions discussed above, the Group made no
major acquisition during the 2016 financial year.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The dispute between Spirel employees and Somfy SA is ongoing
before the Albertville District Court. The employees seek annul-
ment of the transfer of the Spirel securities, which took place in
2010, and to have Somfy SA ordered to pay them damages for the
alleged deliberate bankruptcy of Spirel and non-material damage
caused as a result of the anxiety, disappointment and vexation
they deem to have been victim of, for a total of approximately
€8.2 million. The submissions of Chappel Industries France and
Spirel have been tabled and hearings took place in February 2017.
04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

The Court’s deliberation is due to take place in April 2017.

During 2016, the liquidator of the company Spirel also sought to
have Somfy SA ordered to refund advances of €2.9 million paid by
the AGS (Guarantee Fund for the payment of salary claims) in the
event the disposal was declared null and void.

Somfy SA continues to dispute the arguments put forward by
counsel for the Spirel employees, believes it has complied with
its obligations and remains confident of its chances of receiving a
favourable ruling.

In addition, in the course of July 2015 the employees also brought
Spirel, Chappel Industries France et Somfy SA before the Albertville
Labour Court, disputing the grounds for their dismissal and claiming
damages of a substantially similar amount to that claimed before
the District Court. Due to the absence of submissions and docu-
ments provided by the plaintiffs indicating the grounds on which
the employees based their demands, the Labour Court ordered
the file to be removed in October 2016.

Therefore, the Group continues to qualify these risks as contin-
gent liabilities and no provision was recognised in relation to these
disputes at 31 December 2016.

On 5 January 2015, Somfy SA transferred its 46.1% equity invest-
ment in the share capital of CIAT Group to United Technologies
Corporation, realising a consolidated net capital gain of
€5.9 million, recognised under “Net profit from operations held
for sale or distribution”. A deferred settlement of €10.5 million
at 31 December 2016, relating to the disposal of the shares is
included in Somfy SA’s financial statements with payment spread
until 2019.

On 31 March 2016, United Technologies Corporation filed a claim
against the sellers of the CIAT shares under the liability guarantee
for a total of €22 million (Somfy’s share being €10 million).

The requests included in the claim are unfounded and insuffi-
ciently detailed and justified, leading the Group to send a letter
dated 2 May 2016 to UTC, requesting detailed documentation. To
date, no reply bas been received by the Group.

It remains confident that this dispute will be resolved favourably
and as such has qualified the risk as a contingent liability and no
provision was recognised at 31 December 2016.

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PARENT COMPANY DATA

Over the year ended 31 December 2016, Somfy SA generated sales

including €122.6 million in dividends paid by the subsidiaries in
respect of their net profit for the year to 31 December 2015.

scope effects. Sales increased by 10.2% on a like-for-like basis,
12.1% in the first half-year and 8.2% in the second.

The growth recorded over the second part of the year was all the
more significant as it reflected an acceleration over the last quarter
in spite of an increasingly unfavourable base effect as the months
went on.

Another positive development was that all activities and geographic
regions? posted growth for the second consecutive year.

The most noteworthy performances were recorded in America,
Central and Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific and Southern Europe.
They illustrate the vitality of territories such as Poland, the Czech
Republic, China, Turkey and the countries of the Levant, and they
also testify to the recovery of historical markets such as Italy, the
Iberian Peninsula and the United States.

Increases were lower yet nevertheless positive in Germany and
France, as well as in Northern Europe, despite the decline seen in
the United Kingdom.

RESULTS

The Group’s current operating result was €177.7 million for the
financial year, representing 15.7% of sales and growth of 7.3% in
real terms.

Growth was impacted by exchange rate fluctuations as well as
by higher structure costs, due to increased strategic investments
(research and development, digital transformation, sales forces
and brand).

Consolidated net profit totalled €143.4 million. Restated for excep-
tional items, which were particularly high the previous year due
to changes in scope and adjustments made to provisions”, growth
was 12.7%.

SEGMENT REPORTING AT 31 DECEMBER 2016

FINANCIAL POSITION

Cash flow was €181.7 million for the financial year and covered
the increase in working capital requirements, the rise in invest-
ments, the distribution of dividends and acquisitions over the
financial year’.

The financial position remained very healthy, with a net cash
surplus of €14.6 million at the end of December, compared with
€1.2 million at the start of the year.

The net financial debt corresponds to the difference between
financial assets and financial liabilities. Notably it takes into
account unlisted bonds receivable, issued by certain companies in
which shares are held or related entities, earnout on acquisitions,
liabilities relating to options granted to minority shareholders in
fully-consolidated companies and deferred settlements of a finan-
cial nature. Not included are securities in non-controlling equity
investments, deposits & guarantees and government grants.

Net financial debt is detailed in Note 7.2.3 to the consolidated
financial statements.

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

OUTLOOK

The 2017 financial year should see a slowdown in Sales growth,
given the high level of the comparison base and persisting
economic and political uncertainties in several countries, and by a
relative stability in current operating margin’, taking into account
the integration of newly-acquired companies and the decision to
ramp up the investment policy.

LIST OF EXISTING BRANCHES
(ARTICLE L. 232-1 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

The financial year will also be marked by the roll-out of the strategic
plan, Believe and ACT. The aim of this plan is to position the
Group as a key player in the connected home, with an increased
contribution to comfort, security and energy saving, and enabling
it to fully capitalise on the great potential of the market, driven by
digitalisation, the increasing motorisation of interior products and
improvements in the energy performance of buildings.

Somfy SA had no such branches at 31 December 2016.

VALUE OF INTERCOMPANY LOANS GRANTED

(ARTICLE L. 232-1 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

Somfy SA had not granted any intercompany loans at 31 December 2016.

on behalf of funds under its management, declared that on
1 November 2010 it had a holding of 595,775 shares representing
8.05% of the share capital of Somfy SA. Due to the lack of disclo-
sure regarding the attainment of upward or downward threshold
crossings, this company is still presumed to hold between 5% and
10% of Somfy SA’s share capital.

RECIPROCAL HOLDINGS
(Articles L. 233-29 and R. 233-19 of the Commercial Code)

cated to all fully paid shares that have been duly registered for at
least four years in the name of the same shareholder at the end of
the calendar year preceding that of each General Meeting.

profits or issue premiums, registered shares granted free of charge
to a shareholder in exchange for existing shares, which already
benefit from this right, will be entitled to the same double voting right.
All shares converted into bearer shares or whose ownership has
been transferred shall lose their entitlement to a double voting
right, except in instances provided for by law.”

INFORMATION ON THE BUYBACK OF OWN SHARES

(Article L. 225-211 of the Commercial Code)

The company has implemented several successive share buyback

programmes. The most recent buyback programme was launched

in 2016; it was authorised by the Combined General Meeting of

24 May 2016, and had the following objectives:

— To stimulate the secondary market or ensure the liquidity of the
Somfy share, by way of an investment services provider within a
liquidity contract that complies with the Ethics Charter of AMAFI
recognised by regulations;

— To retain the shares purchased and subsequently exchange
them or use them as payment within the framework of potential
acquisitions;

— To ensure the coverage of stock option plans and/or free share
allocation plans (or similar) granted to employees and/or corpo-
rate officers of the Group, as well as all other shares allocated
under a company or group savings scheme (or similar), in rela-
tion to employee profit-sharing and/or any other form of alloca-
tion to employees and/or corporate officers of the Group;

— To cover marketable securities giving right to the allocation of
company shares, in accordance with applicable regulations;

— To proceed with the possible cancellation of shares acquired, in
accordance with the authorisation granted or to be granted by
the Extraordinary General Meeting.

The company reserved the right to use options or derivative instru-

ments, in accordance with applicable regulations.

The maximum purchase price was set at €480 per share, with

the maximum amount of the share buyback programme set at

€97,977,600, taking account of the 535,880 treasury shares held at

31 December 2015.

During the financial year just ended, on the basis of the authorisa-

tion given by the General Meetings of 2015 and 2016, the company

bought back 16,684 shares at an average price of €346.26, sold

16,457 shares at an average price of €344.08 and transferred 3,400

shares priced for final vesting of free shares.

All of the 16,684 shares acquired were allocated to the liquidity
objective.

No shares were re-allocated for objectives other than those initially
specified.

The company held 532,707 of its own shares at 31 December 2016,
representing 7.20% of the share capital; the value of the purchase
price of one share amounted to €185.94 for a par value of €1 each,
representing a total nominal value of €532,707 (€616 for the liquidity
contract, €246,854 to be retained for future acquisition transactions
and €285,237 to cover share purchase option plans and/or free share
allocation plans).

Remuneration includes a fixed part and a variable part.

Variable remuneration is determined by the Supervisory Board
on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. It is
based on the achievement of objectives that take account of
quantitative financial and qualitative criteria. For the part based
on quantitative criteria (referred to as “financial” criteria), the
criteria used are profit growth, measured by the average growth
in Current Operating Result over two years; the growth in prof-
itability of capital used, measured by the average level of ROCE
(Return On Capital Employed) over two years; and lastly, business
development, measured by Sales growth and by its differential
with the Sales growth of a range of benchmarks consisting of
nine companies deemed to be comparable. For the part based
on qualitative criteria (referred to as “non-financial” criteria),
the criteria used concern the quality performance within the
company, the monitoring of the Quality Management System
(QMS), and the implementation of the Development Master Plan
(DMP). These non-financial criteria are weighted by a coefficient
representing the Supervisory Board’s assessment, upon proposal
by the Remuneration Committee, of the personal and managerial
involvement of the Management Board member concerned. For
confidentiality reasons the expected level of achievement of quan-
titative criteria, as well as the qualitative criteria, which are prede-
termined by the Supervisory Board, are not publicly disclosed.
Benefits in kind consist of the use of a company car.

The LTI bonus is intended to promote the collective development
of Somfy and to ensure the loyalty of employee beneficiaries.

22

It is based on the achievement of a level of COR (Current Operating
Result) for Somfy in 2014 and 2015 and subject to beneficiaries
being employed by the Group at 30 June 2016. Jean Guillaume
Despature is a beneficiary of this bonus in respect of his
employment contract, which predates his appointment to the
Management Board.

In respect of his employment contract, which predates his appoint-
ment to the Management Board, Jean Guillaume Despature is
also a beneficiary of the defined contribution pension plan of
the company DSG SA, which applies equally to senior executives
and employee managers. This is the second mandatory pillar for
companies based in the Swiss Confederation.

The principles and criteria used to determine, apportion and
allocate the various fixed, variable and exceptional items of remu-
neration comprising total remuneration and benefits attributable
to the Chairman of the Management Board are specified in the new
separate report prepared in accordance with Article L. 225-82-2 of
the Commercial Code (page 50).

Details of remuneration paid during the financial year just ended

the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. It is based
on the achievement of objectives that take account of quantitative
financial and qualitative criteria. For the part based on quantita-
tive criteria (referred to as “financial” criteria), the criteria used
are profit growth, measured by the average growth in Current
Operating Result over two years; the growth in profitability of
capital used, measured by the average level of ROCE (Return On
Capital Employed) over two years; and lastly, business develop-
ment, measured by Sales growth and by its differential with the
Sales growth of a range of benchmarks consisting of nine compa-
nies deemed to be comparable. For the part based on qualita-
tive criteria (referred to as “non-financial” criteria), the criteria
used concern the quality performance within the company, the

implementation of the Development Master Plan (DMP). These
non-financial criteria are weighted by a coefficient representing
the Supervisory Board’s assessment, upon proposal by the
Remuneration Committee, of the personal and managerial involve-
ment of the Management Board member concerned. For confiden-
tiality reasons the expected level of achievement of quantitative
criteria, as well as the qualitative criteria, which are predetermined
by the Supervisory Board, are not publicly disclosed.

The variable remuneration also includes the incentive bonus,
profit sharing and contributions to the Group savings scheme, as
described in the report of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
The LTI bonus is intended to promote the collective development
of Somfy and to ensure the loyalty of employee beneficiaries. It
is based on the achievement of a level of COR (Current Operating
Result) for Somfy in 2014 and 2015 and subject to beneficiaries
being employed by the Group at 30 June 2016. Pierre Ribeiro is a
beneficiary of this bonus in respect of his employment contract,
which predates his appointment to the Management Board.
Benefits in kind consist of the use of a company car.

In respect of his employment contract, which predates his
appointment to the Management Board, Pierre Ribeiro is also
a beneficiary of the defined contribution pension plan of the
company CMC SARL (Article 83), which applies equally to senior
executives and employee managers. The value of this life annuity
was estimated at €8,336 at 31 December 2016 for a pension at the
age of 65.

The company’s commitment is limited to the amount of contribu-
tions paid during the financial year, with the annual charge borne
by the company calculated at the rate of 6.25% of employer contri-
bution on the reference salary made up of tranches A and B set for
the French senior executive’s pension plan. Total charges borne by
the company for 2016 were €9,654.

The principles and criteria used to determine, apportion and
allocate the various fixed, variable and exceptional items of
remuneration comprising total remuneration and benefits attrib-
utable to the member of the Management Board are specified
in the new separate report prepared in accordance with Article
L. 225-82-2 of the Commercial Code (page 50).

Jean-Philippe Demaél’s remuneration includes a fixed part and a
variable part.

Variable remuneration is determined by the Supervisory Board on
the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. It is based
on the achievement of objectives that take account of quantitative
financial and qualitative criteria. For the part based on quantita-
tive criteria (referred to as “financial” criteria), the criteria used
are profit growth, measured by the average growth in Current

Operating Result over two years; the growth in profitability of
capital used, measured by the average level of ROCE (Return On
Capital Employed) over two years; and lastly, business develop-
ment, measured by Sales growth and by its differential with the
Sales growth of a range of benchmarks consisting of nine compa-
nies deemed to be comparable. For the part based on qualita-
tive criteria (referred to as “non-financial” criteria), the criteria
used concern the quality performance within the company, the
monitoring of the Quality Management System (QMS), and the
implementation of the Development Master Plan (DMP). These
non-financial criteria are weighted by a coefficient representing
the Supervisory Board’s assessment, upon proposal by the
Remuneration Committee, of the personal and managerial involve-
ment of the Management Board member concerned. For confiden-
tiality reasons the expected level of achievement of quantitative
criteria, as well as the qualitative criteria, which are predetermined
by the Supervisory Board, are not publicly disclosed.

The variable remuneration also includes the incentive bonus,
profit sharing and contributions to the Group savings scheme, as
described in the report of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
Benefits in kind consist of the use of a company car.

The company CMC SARL established a supplementary pension
plan in 2006. This plan applies to Directors and III-C position Senior
Executives, as well as Managers benefiting from an employment
contract, in accordance with the categories defined by the French
Convention Collective Nationale des Ingénieurs et Cadres de la
Métallurgie (collective bargaining agreement for engineers and
managers in the metalworking industry).

The plan grants a contingent right to a supplementary pension,
pursuant to the so-called “Article 39”, which is dependent on the
length of service of the beneficiary (a minimum of 15 years). The
right to a supplementary pension is acquired at a rate of 0.75% per
year of service and cannot exceed 15% of the potential beneficiary’s
reference salary. The reference salary is defined as the average of
the best three years after applying CNAV re-evaluation coefficients.
Based on estimates setting at 35% the future rate of replacement
provided by the compulsory pension plans when the affected
population reaches retirement age, this plan should enable the rate
to increase to 35 + 15 = 50% of the reference salary for beneficiaries
whose career within the Group lasted 20 years or more.
Commitments of the plan and corresponding assets have been
outsourced to an insurance company. Future commitments are
fully covered by plan assets under management, which were
measured at fair value.

Member of the Management Board concerned: Jean-Philippe
Demaél, potential beneficiary of this pension plan. Due to his
departure, he is no longer a potential beneficiary of the contract
granting a contingent right to an additional supplementary pension
(namely “Article 39”), and the company no longer has any commit-
ment in this respect.

In relation to his employment contract predating his appointment
to the Management Board, Jean-Philippe Demaél is also a benefi-
ciary of CMC SARL’s defined contribution pension plan (Article 83),
applicable to senior executives as well as employee managers.
The value of this life annuity was estimated at €8,615 at 31 December
2016 for a pension at the age of 65.

The company’s commitment is limited to the amount of contri-
butions paid during the financial year, with the annual charge
borne by the company calculated at the rate of 6.25% of employer
contribution on the reference salary made up of tranches A and B
set for the French senior executive’s pension plan. Total charges
borne by the company for the duration of the term of office on the
Management Board are €1,998.

Details of remuneration paid during the financial year just ended
are included in the summary table (page 25).

In the area of R&D, the year 2016 saw a continuation of the
previous year’s work, especially in terms of product launches. As
for connectivity, efforts for all the Group’s brands were stepped
up, in the form of new offerings or acquisitions. The Technical
Departments of the Home & Building Activity and BFT also
experienced changes, and the new Innovation Department set up
in late 2015 yielded its initial results.

In 2016, at the initiative of the Innovation and Corporate Marketing
Departments, Somfy Group created the mysomfylab.com platform
to host an open community (recruiting open to the general public
on the basis of the projects to be co-designed) to conduct “crowd-
storming” as well as a closed community (selective recruiting of
product users in our markets) for tests and studies involving expe-
rienced users.

The innovation of MySomfyLab is the possibility it offers of
conducting open or closed conversations online to explore the
next areas of opportunity and also to test innovative concepts in
direct contact with the market. It was launched in June 2016 and
three conversations were held at the end of the year.

The closed section of MySomfyLab can be used to easily test
all the components of the marketing mix, whether for a basic
development or a complete offering, and in a very responsive
and flexible way. Launched in France in 2016, it has already seen
significant activity.

The Innovation Department also structured the prospecting and
monitoring approach by creating an internal network of around
15 individuals, mainly from Somfy SAS, whose work includes these
two aspects (technological monitoring, competition monitoring,
standards monitoring, sustainable development, purchasing, intel-
ligence marketing, etc.).

The result of this work is shared with all employees by the Yammer
Group in “Open Café” sessions and also via a twice-yearly in-house
magazine, EXPLORE, which presents the Group’ main areas of
focus in terms of prospecting and monitoring.

The Home & Building Activity continued to be very active in 2016.
First, with a view to continually improving mastery of key know-how
in terms of development, Home & Building’s Technical Department
finished its recruiting and became completely operational. It
handles the transformation of innovations and new technological
bricks into components and sub-assemblies that can be industrial-
ised and integrated into new offerings and solutions. While contin-
uing to strengthen its mechanical and electronics engineering, it
also boosted its skills in systems engineering. High-level coordina-
tion has now been set up between our mechatronics architectures
coordinated by the Home & Building Activity and our digital archi-
tectures coordinated by the Connected Solutions Activity.
Another methodological development is the introduction of an
agile structure and a dedicated process in Home & Building, to be

26

able to respond even more effectively to the specific needs of our
key accounts. This move is part of our commitment to strength-
ening our partnerships with these customers, in particular in the
area of interior products. Whether it involves curtains or awnings,
co-development with these partners is a significant growth lever in
the US, the Middle East and Asia.

Launched in 2015 and recognised in 2016 with the innovation award
at the EquipBaie Trade show (France), the RS100 Smooth&Smart
Operator range is available for sale throughout the European
market. Other remarkable innovations include the solar offering for
rolling shutters and the new control centre for motorised openings
in residential and office buildings: the TouchBuco IB+, which offers
a simple touchscreen interface for managing automated functions
while enabling productivity gains both during its implementation
and later in its use in the buildings.

However, the main developments in R&D were in the Connected
Solutions Activity.

The Group continued to redeploy its connected home activi-
ties. After creating the Connected Solutions Activity in 2015, it
announced the formation of Somfy Protect, a division dedicated
to security, in late 2016.

This division encompasses all security-related developments
— videophones, cameras, detectors and alarms — within the
Connected Solutions Activity. The creation of this division got
underway in 2016 with the transfer of the Security Business Group,
which had previously been part of our Access Activity. At the end
of 2016, this move was strengthened by the acquisition of Myfox,
a French firm specialised in connected security.

The new Somfy Protect division will expand the Group’s connected
security offering. The Somfy Protect range includes many unique
technologies protected by a portfolio of international patents, in
particular IntellTAG™, the world’s first window/door sensor that is
composed of a single piece and triggers a preventive alarm upon
the first vibrations of a break-in attempt.

The creation of this Somfy Protect division demonstrates Somfy
Group’s commitment to boosting its expertise in the area of
security and is the natural continuation of the early 2016 consol-
idation of Opendoors SAS into the Connected Solutions Activity,
which allowed Somfy to expand its connected offering with a
motorised locking solution.

The development teams immediately set to work to put the new
Myfox offering on the market under the Somfy brand and to make
it compatible with the Somfy ecosystem. The result of these efforts,
Somfy One, won two CES Innovation Awards — in the Smart Home
and Embedded Technologies categories — at the 2017 International
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

Connected Solutions is also continuing to develop its TaHoma
platform for the connected home, as well as its Connexoon offer-
04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

ings, which are connected products specialised by application.
Finally, Somfy is also continuing its growth on the connected home
market in Asia with a partnership with iHome, an integrator of
connected solutions dedicated to automation in high-rise residen-
tial buildings in Southeast Asia.

This ambition is taking concrete form with the introduction of an
R&D team in the Connected Solutions Activity in Hong Kong with
two initial hires in 2016.

In 2016, BFT launched the first electromechanical operator
designed for suspended garage doors using MEMS technology,
which is to say equipped with gyroscopes and accelerometers. This
allows the automated product to have virtual switches, which gives
installers the opportunity to more quickly and easily complete
their installations. A patent application has been filed.

The U-Link protocol and its associated communication system,
launched in 2015, continue to be enhanced. The Universal Link
platform that ensures U-Link’s interoperability now has a Wi-Fi
interface. Moreover, lighting control is now possible, as is control
of previously installed wired BFT products.

Finally, BFT hired a Development Director with a view to optimising
coordination between the three R&D divisions based in Italy (Schio,
Correggio and Borgo Valsugana).

In 2016, the SIMU brand continued its investments in connectivity
by increasing its staff of electronic engineers by 30% and also by
improving its communication protocol dedicated to Industrial and
Commercial Shutters to better meet regulatory needs in this area
(CSTB certification).

In 2016, Somfy Group filed 41 new patent applications. The port-
folio is made up of 2,007 patents.

A SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT POLICY IN LINE
WITH SOMFY GROUP’S CORPORATE IDENTITY
AND THE STRATEGIC VISION IT PORTRAYS

Following the roll-out and sharing of the Group’s new identity in
2015, the year 2016 was a chance to reaffirm its corporate culture
and expand its identity framework to formulate a vision shared by
all Group employees: improve consumers’ living spaces by making
our innovations accessible to more people.

In 2016, the name Somfy Spirit was devised to designate the
Group’s personality in a document describing our corporate
culture. Although it has changed over time, this personality is
rooted in the history of the Group’s formation and depends upon
the women and men who bring it to life, with two specific areas
of focus:

— entrepreneurial spirit

— personal fulfilment

Somfy Spirit is first and foremost the Group’s identity — the things
that are specific to it and make it unique: its visions and values.
It also defines the basics of the growth model that has over the
years allowed the company to expand and constantly reinvent
itself. Finally, it establishes the management principles that unite
the teams on a daily basis.

In 1994, as Somfy accelerated its internationalisation, its managers
felt the need to document this identity in a Management Charter,
which the Group updated in 2005. Then, in 2016, as Somfy
accelerated its transformation towards a digitalisation of its
solutions, its managers wanted to carry out a collective project.
The result is Somfy Spirit Book, a reference document available to
employees that translates all the ways in which the Somfy Spirit is
expressed.

The world in which we live is rapidly changing. At a time when
home automation is becoming increasingly digitised, some major
challenges lie ahead for the Group. Somfy Spirit is the solid
foundation allowing the company to meet these challenges while
staying confident about its collective future.

To this end, the Group also relies on its own one-of-a-kind growth

27

model. For over 40 years now, it has allowed the Group to grow

and to take confident action together with all its stakeholders.

This growth model is based on:

— Independence, since Somfy remains free while mastering all the
basics of its business, from innovation to distribution;

— Continuity, since Somfy works to ensure the continuation of its
strategy and the stability of its teams;

— Foresight, since from the time of its founding, Somfy has been
making bold moves and taking advantage of developments and
opportunities ahead of its competitors;

-— a Global-Local Alliance, since Somfy Group is committed
to combining local impetus with the strength of the global
approach made available to each entity.

For Somfy, the men and women acting responsibly to achieve a

shared goal are the heart of the business. To this end, Somfy relies

upon a flexible organisation that continually adapts to strategic
challenges as well as developments in its markets.

Somfy uses three operating principles that allow it to make

effective decisions, ensure collaboration between the various

entities and implement its strategy in a volatile and complex world:

— co-construction, which promotes alignment and effectiveness
of implementation powered by the creativity and diversity of
each staff member;

— subsidiarity, which guarantees our agility and ability to delegate
decision-making for optimised performance;

— cross-functionality, which facilitates teamwork and de-partitioning
to achieve better results.

Somfy’s management principles guide its employees’ behaviour,

actions and decisions day in and day out. This is why it is essential

for the Group to:

— rally the teams around a shared goal and ambition;

— contribute to the personal development of each staff member,
encouraging autonomy and responsibility;

— take action to ensure customer satisfaction. The Group promotes
proximity and the keeping of commitments;

— encourage cooperation founded on teamwork and _ cross-
functional initiatives to achieve common goals in a spirit of
sharing and fellowship;

— set examples and embody its values, ensuring that it continues
to earn the trust employees, customers and partners place in it.
The values (Boldness, Respect, Openness and Proximity) and
Somfy Group’s mission, which are all embodied by our growth
model, put CSR goals at the heart of our value creation. They
support Group employees’ commitment and serve the long-term
interests of the Group and its stakeholders. This assists with the
gradual yet decisive implementation of Sustainable Development
drivers in the Group’s strategy and operations.
The main levers of the Group’s entities are monitoring the profes-
sional and personal development of all staff members, improving
their work environment, minimising the environmental impact of
all our operations, sites and products, and bearing their responsi-
bility by getting involved in society issues that are related to their
business areas.
These levers are gradually being strengthened with an ongoing
improvement approach measured by indicators and the imple-
mentation of dialogue with all stakeholders as well as regular,
transparent communications.
Somfy Group’s Sustainable Development policy is the declara-
tion of its corporate identity. It seeks to meet, even surpass the
expectations of its customers and stakeholders, to unite them
in a greater ambition; the achievement of the Group’s mission:
providing better living environments for all, not only in terms of
comfort but also energy saving, security and independence for the
people who live there.

GOVERNANCE

The Steering Committee for Sustainable Development brings
together the Sustainable Development Director, the Human
Resources Director and the Communications Director. Its mission
is to ensure the coherent implementation of the three lines of
Somfy’ Sustainable Development strategy: Planet, Employees and
Society.

For the past nine years, Somfy has had a Sustainable Development
Department. It reports to the Group’s Industrial Department.
Its missions are to guide the implementation of the Group’s
environmental commitments. The organisation as a whole and
the teams within the Group also contribute to the continuous
improvement of the Sustainable Development policy.

In 2016, in order to ensure efficiency and consistency with
its strategy, Somfy created an Organisation and Management
Department which the Group’s Human Resources, Communication
and Information Systems Departments report to. The task
of the Group Human Resources Department and the Group
Communications Department is to guide the implementation of
Somfy’s commitments relating to social and societal matters. In
this regard, the Group Communications Director is a member of
the Somfy Foundation Governing Board, the main driving force
of the Group’s citizenship policy, and whose main purpose is to
support projects that fight poor housing.

CLARIFICATION REGARDING SCOPE

The scope of analysis of the social data for the preparation of the
2016 CSR report increased. The report now covers 41 Somfy Group
companies, 14 additions in relation to the 2015 CSR scope; and
4,942 employees at 31 December 2016, representing 76.8% of
the Group’s total workforce — an increase of almost eight points
compared to the previous year (68.9% of the Group in 2015).
These 41 companies in the 2016 CSR scope are spread across five
continents, and 30 countries (South Africa, Germany, UK, Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, South Korea, Egypt, Spain, United
States, France, Greece, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Morocco, Norway,
Netherlands, Poland, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Russia,
Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunisia and Turkey).

WORKFORCE

Over the 2016 financial year, the workforce grew 6.5%, going from
4,640 to 4,942 employees.

The increase in workforce is representative of the Group’s interna-
tional development.

Central and Eastern Europe account for most of the expanded
scope with five new entities that together represent 34% of new
additions to the scope. It is also the geographic region that has
seen its workforce grow the most, proportionally, between 2015
and 2016 (up 26%), mainly due to the sharp increase of the work-
force at our Polish factory SOPEM, which grew by 40.2%, going
from 234 to 328 employees.

Once again this year, 35-44 year olds are the age group most
represented in the scope. However, the age groups which have
changed the most year-on-year are the under 25s and over 55s.
This proves that the Group is both preparing its future generations,
and surrounding itself with experienced people.

PAYROLL

Across the Group, employee expenses amounted to €333.8 million
at 31 December 2016, compared with €313.3 million at
31 December 2015.

Within the CSR scope, these totalled €276.6 million at 31 December
2016, representing almost 83% of the Group compared with €255.8
million at 31 December 2015 representing 81.7% of the Group.

It should be noted that employee expenses for the 2015 CSR scope,
published in last year’s report, represented 74% of the Group.

A RESPONSIBLE SOCIAL POLICY

The Group’s Social Responsibility policy is to support Somfy
Group’s transformation in its continued international expansion, in
creating new markets and increasing its innovation activity.

The human context in 2016 was impacted by three major events:
the change in governance, the strengthening of corporate culture
with Somfy Spirit, and the postponement in announcing the
Believe ! initiative in order for it to be redrafted and implemented
in amore targeted manner. During this transitional year, it seemed
necessary for the Group to maintain and put into effect initiatives
that were already in place under the Better living together banner.
The Somfy Spirit and the desire to strive towards ever more
personal development have thus been real sources of inspiration
in creating the roadmap in the field of Human Resources around
the following three priorities:

— Caring for people;

— Preparing future generations;

— Embodying Somfy attitudes.

255 years

CARING FOR PEOPLE

Financial results are far from being the only element that ensure
Somfy Group’s continuity. Employees’ commitment, motivation
and well-being are key criteria enabling the Group to be sustain-
ably productive and competitive. It is therefore essential for the
Group to understand its teams in order to better support and value
them.

The measures deployed help to provide both direction to the
collective project and consistency to maintain and strengthen
commitment within the teams. Each employee is a key player in
this development. A whole series of social measures are currently
in place so that everyone is involved in the ongoing changes: access
to information, development possibilities etc. They also include
a formalisation of the practices ensuring that everyone receives
balanced support and is listened to more.

The strategic issue of competitiveness calls for every employee
to feel recognised, individually involved and to share a desire for
collective success.

These aspects are essential for employees’ personal development.
Thus the Somfyscope, a survey carried out every two years with
Somfy Group employee*®, measures commitment rates across all
teams.

Somfyscope 2016

Commitment expresses employees’ engagement, participation
and motivation. It is a key factor in corporate success because it
has a direct impact both on company results and employee well-
being, at all levels of the organisation. The methodology used
in this study — component analysis — has helped identify the key
factors of Somfy employee commitment.

The Somfy commitment model is thus based on five indicators:

— commitment to Somfy: this includes trust in the organisation,
to what extent employees identify with Somfy Group, and the
perception they have of Somfy management;

— organisational effectiveness: this includes the level of flexibility,
employee perception of the quality of products and services
supplied, and cooperation;

— own work: this includes satisfaction with one’s position and
level of responsibility, energy, and working conditions;

— prospects and management: this includes each employee’s
prospects within the Group, and support from one’s immediate
superior;

— recognition: this includes compensation and benefits.
The results of these surveys are used to identify Somfy Group
strengths and areas for improvement, and to implement action
plans. The 2016 survey produced a record participation rate of
84% (89% when surveyed electronically), representing more than
4,000 employees. The Chairman of the Management Board, Jean
Guillaume Despature, sees a “sign of great interest for Somfy
and the hope of seeing a strengthening of the Somfy Spirit”. His
demand is that “Somfy place the fulfilment of its employees at the
centre of its priorities.’”°
The Group’s Director of Organisation and Management also
highlighted that the level of commitment measured by this third
survey reached 56.3% — up 5.4 points compared to the previous
survey. “In terms of strengths, we can note greater confidence in
top management and the Group’s future, as well as a strong sense
of achievement on a daily basis, together with a clear perception
of everyone’s contribution to Somfy’s success. There is also a real
pride in belonging to the Group.””°

Action plans implemented after Somfyscope 2014 led to an

increase in the level of satisfaction for priority levers. Some of

them, namely processes, cooperation and embodiment of values
remain key levers for improving the rate of commitment.

The results of the survey offered positive feedback regarding the
transformation processes taking place within Somfy. Managers will
be responsible for implementing and monitoring an action plan
with their teams and thereby helping to strengthen the commit-
ment of Somfy Group employees.

Work organisation

In all the companies within the scope, the average working week
complies with the applicable local legislation and varies between 35
and 45 hours of work per week. The most common working week
is 40 hours, covering more than 54.6% of the staff within the scope
of the study.

Organisation by shift schedule concerned the following produc-
tion sites in 2016: Somfy SAS, SITEM and SOPEM. None of the new
entities in the scope practise this type of organisation. Overall, this
organisation applied to approximately 28% of employees included in
the scope. Note that 4.9% of the total workforce is part-time, mainly
in Europe and to a lesser extent in the United States, Australia,
Russia, Singapore, Israel and Japan.

Collective working hours can vary depending on production plans
and business opportunities. This flexibility is essential in adapting
to market needs. One of the adjustment parameters at industrial
level is night time working, which takes place on an ad hoc basis in
the event of a production peak.

Social relations

Social dialogue refers to all the relationships and interactions
that exist within the company between Management, execu-
tive staff, staff representatives and employees. It is an important
component in regulating the collective organisation of work, and
it enables Somfy Group’s social frame of reference to progress
and employees to be informed about the Group’s position and its
areas of development and transformation. The company wishes to
enhance its quality and role.

All the companies in the CSR review scope comply with the local
laws and agreements connected with their activities.

Faced with the complexity in which the Group is developing and in
order to better connect the strategic challenges and the economic
constraints with employees’ aspirations and expectations, the
social dialogue drive has been particularly strengthened with
employees in France. Although not all companies in the CSR review
scope have union representatives, social dialogue is guaranteed or
implemented through regular meetings and/or communication
with staff representative bodies or with employees directly. Where
there are no trade union representatives, the management princi-
ples of Somfy Spirit thus serve as standards to implement dialogue
with employees and bring them together on a common project.
Generally, the companies in France, Italy, Germany, Tunisia and
Poland have union representation, as well as LianDa, in China.
The others, which are smaller in terms of workforce and subject

30

to fewer requirements in this field, encourage social dialogue via
direct meetings with employees.

Certain companies signed new agreements in 2016 or amend-
ments to agreements in place, primarily in the fields of social
dialogue (France), salaries and employee benefits (China, France,
Italy and Tunisia), work organisation and working time (France),
quality of working life (Italy), training (Italy), and health and safety
(Italy, China).

Somfy SAS, representing 30.3% of the 2016 workforce in the CSR
scope, signed six agreements for this purpose in partnership with
staff representative bodies in 2016.

For Somfy SAS, in the context of ongoing dialogue with trade
unions or staff representatives concerning health and safety at
work, 14 meetings of the Health, Safety and Working Conditions
Committee (HSWCC) were held in 2016 for three sites of the entity.
Several countries including Poland, France, Norway and Sweden
have taken action to improve the “Quality of Working Life”. These
improvements have taken the form, for example, of time and
financial assistance for sporting activities, a concierge service, or
childcare through child minding organisations in France.

Somfy SAS Working Time Agreement

Between late 2015 and 2016, the Social Affairs Department of
Somfy SAS worked closely with social partners to secure the
signing of a new Working Time Agreement on 26 July 2016. It
became effective on 1 January 2017.

This new organisation of working time at Somfy SAS is the result of
a joint effort between management and social partners. With this
new agreement, the company was keen to respond to both the
economic and human challenges that the Group faces today, and
to strengthen team supervision both in terms of working hours
and workload. The goal is to empower managers and employees
to promote a good work-life balance, and to set out clear and fair
management rules for all.

The spirit of this agreement thus aims to encourage flexibility
and fairness. In 2016, to complement the agreement’s presenta-
tion and assimilation by teams, communication kits were made
available, a connected hotline was set up, and Human Resources
Managers were on hand to assist with further information.

With this new agreement managers are now more than ever the
key players in the balanced approach between “Well-being” and
“Performance”.

Health and safety

The development of health and safety is one of the key pillars of
Somfy’s human project characterised by the desire to live better
together within the Group. Somfy’s corporate responsibility begins
with a guarantee to ensure everyone’s physical safety and discover
a quality of life within their working environment that encourages
commitment.

Most of the companies have an occupational health department
and internal safety functions, notably strengthened in France by
the support of company doctors and specialists in ergonomics.
Efforts have been made in many countries to reduce the exposure
to risks and to improve working conditions. The roll-out of a
solution to manage occupational risks began in France in 2016.
The Dutch subsidiary for example has started to gradually replace
its office furniture in order to improve the ergonomics of employee
workstations. Likewise, ergonomics is a subject at the heart of
SOPEM’s concerns in Poland, where working postures are regularly
analysed and even corrected for both production and adminis-
trative staff. Within Somfy SAS, a Safety Officer was appointed in
order to improve safety management with the intention of making
it a field of expertise.
04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

Work accidents frequency and severity rate indicators

In 2016, many companies within the CSR scope strengthened their
communication and awareness raising initiatives in the field of
occupational risks. Specific examples involve tangible initiatives
on our industrial sites (pedestrian walkways, evacuation signage,
safety induction booklets, skylight renovation, etc.) and more
broadly awareness concerning mobile employees in relation to the
issue of travel risks.

In accordance with the decisions taken as part of the preparation
of the 2015 report, we have decided to split the review of these
frequency”? and severity”? rates according to the industrial or
commercial activity of the companies. The changes observed in
2015 are due to corrections and the addition of new companies
into the CSR scope.

The target set in 2015 by the industrial organisation to reduce the
frequency rate has clearly been achieved. This indicator was also
used in the Somfy SAS incentive agreement.

Overall, in spite of the fact that the number of days of absence
caused by these accidents increased by almost 4%, the frequency
rate improved and the severity rate has remained stable. In fact,
the number of accidents has fallen by 7% year-on-year, and the
hours worked paid have increased by nearly 6%, which has a direct
impact on these indicators.

Staff at distribution subsidiaries are less vulnerable to the risk
of workplace accidents than employees at industrial sites. This
is reflected in the frequency and severity rates which are lower
at distribution subsidiaries (respectively 2.68 and 0.03) than at
industrial sites (5.74 and 0.15). At distribution subsidiary level, the
frequency rate of 2.68 can be explained by seven workplace acci-
dents for an average number of less than 12 days’ absence per
person.

Somfy SAS and SITEM account for 78% of accidents of the indus-
trial CSR scope. As a result, both these entities have intensified
their efforts with, amongst other things, the continuation of
Short Interval Management (SIM) that give rise to daily reviews
with production employees during which problems detected are
reported. The latter are immediately resolved insofar as possible,
and if needs be employees have five more senior levels whom they
can address. Between 2015 and 2016 their overall frequency rate
fell from 8.55 to 6.61; and the severity level from 0.18 to 0.16.
Work-related accidents and occupational diseases are always
investigated, and preventive action implemented, by dedicated
working groups or specially appointed employee representative
bodies, according to country (HSWCC in France for example).
The number of employees affected by a recognised occupational
disease has increased from eight to nine people throughout the
scope.”> Most recognition of occupational diseases is related to
Musculo-Skeletal Disorders (MSDs). Preventive measures have
also been continued: gestures and postures training, workstation
ergonomics, and production station rotation.

Initiatives related to Psycho-Social Risks (PSR) problems, and more
generally to quality of working life, launched in France in 2014,
have been maintained and strengthened: expanding and formal-
ising the monitoring network, training employees and managers in
stress management, organisation of rest and relaxation measures,
and Sustainable Development initiatives.

In 2016, absences due to common illness, occupational diseases, as
well as work- and commuting-related accidents resulted in 4.1%4
of absenteeism (3.8% in 2015); days of absence being taken into
consideration according to the calendar day protocol, i.e. including
Saturday and Sunday.

Equal treatment

Somfy Group pays particular attention to avoiding any form
of discrimination and to encouraging the equal treatment of
employees and applicants as far as possible. It is important to
highlight the diversity in both our activities and in the people who
are developing and supporting them.

In terms of professional equality, taking into account develop-
ments in legislation, the French companies have signed agreements
or drafted action plans committing them to setting improvement
targets in this field and implementing measures to achieve them.
Somfy signed an agreement in 2013, amended in September 2014
and which expired at the end of 2016.

A review of this agreement highlighted areas of progress to be
expanded on with all stakeholders. The levers that seem to have
been most effective in achieving goals are those related to the
improvement of working conditions and the relationship between
work and family life. New negotiations are scheduled in 2017.

In 2016, the female workforce within the CSR scope grew by 6.6%
(6.5% for male staff), and the ratio of male to female employees
changed slightly with 54% men and 46% women. In 2015, the
male/female ratio was 51/49; this change is due to the fact that
75% of employees newly integrated into the scope of study are
men.

Analysis of 2016 workforce
within the CSR scope

@ Men

@ Women

This variation between the Group and the CSR scope can be
explained by the presence in the 2016 scope of three major
production sites with overwhelmingly female staff (SOPEM, SITEM
and LianDa) with an overall proportion of 76.5% women.

In the area of disability, the majority of the Group’s companies
are subject to local regulations with which they comply. Some take
additional action, often with the support of specialist agencies,
to improve the working conditions of any employees affected by
specific health problems; their continued employment remaining
an ongoing priority. Several measures, such as adapting worksta-
tions or working hours, adapting premises, or support in terms of
recognition, restructuring or reclassification can be seen.

In the area of ethics, the majority of Somfy Group employees
have now been informed of the existence of the Ethics Charter,
which was launched in 2015, and have been made aware of its
contents and trained in ethical concepts by their managers. This
Charter is a tool for the promotion of dialogue between employees
so that ethics is an open matter understood by all. More details are
provided in the societal section of this report.

Somfy Group has a network of Human Resources Managers exten-
ding across the entire scope covered by this report. One of their
roles is to ensure the respect of Human Rights, particularly exami-
ning within their scope rights and concerns relating to racial discri-
mination, torture, enforced disappearances, disabled people and
the rights of women, children, migrants, minorities and indigenous
peoples.

PREPARING FUTURE GENERATIONS

The company continued its effort to ensure that the skills of Group
employees are matched with the organisation’s needs, to ensure
the employability of staff and prepare tomorrow’s generation of
managers.

Employment

In 2016, there were 762 recruitments, higher than the number of
departures (459), which included 32 redundancies. Moreover, the
rate of voluntary turnover’, exclusively involving resignations and
retirement, was 4.4% (vs 4.2% in 2015).

It should be noted that the company continued to focus on internal
mobility. As such, in France®, more than 39% of positions?’ were
filled via internal mobility.

Somfy SAS in France and SITEM in Tunisia account for no less than
48% of the workforce within the scope of the study in 2016. 41% of
employees who joined us in 2016 are based in France.

Below is an overview of the changes in workforce by geographical zone:

International Human Resources Information System: IHRIS

During 2016, the roll-out of IHRIS (International Human Resources
Information System) continued and at the end of the year covered
4,000 people, or 62% of the Group’s workforce, across 47 countries.
The companies added to the tool this year were: Somfy PTY Ltd,
Domis SA, BFT Italia SpA, Automatismes BFT France SAS, LianDa
and the Northern Europe region, i.e. an increase of 27% in terms of
coverage compared with 2015. This information system will help to
build and develop a shared HR culture and to provide management
with new decision-making aids.

Training

Investment in training focused on initiatives likely to help the Group
achieve its transformation objectives, in order to act in a more
agile, prompt and simple way both collectively and individually,
and to support cooperation and performance.

The number of training hours’ in 2016 for the entire CSR scope

was approximately 70,000.

In 2015 at Somfy SAS 8.2% of training was in-house. In 2016, 14.8%

of training courses were taught this way, and overall 2% of training

took place via e-learning.

The main training areas used in 2016 generally involved the

development or strengthening of:

— professional expertise development (products, digital marketing,
quality, HR skills amongst others) for 25 subsidiaries within the
CSR scope;

— Health & Safety for 15 subsidiaries within the CSR scope - Somfy
SAS has for example devoted 18% of its total number of training
hours to this topic;

— management skills for 12 subsidiaries within the CSR scope;

intercultural skills;

personal development;

office automation skills;

— project management.

The Somfy Academies

The “Management and Leadership” Academy, created in 2013, is
aimed at managers’ managers. This system, which alternates ten
days of training, mentoring and exchange of best practices, aims to
promote transformation and meet Somfy’s expectations in relation
to the attitude of management. This enables managers to better
manage complexity and to guide projects with their team more
efficiently. In 2016, approximately 40 new managers and executives

28. Published training hours refer to sessions lasting more than two hours.
NB: in 2016, part of the hours reported by Somfy SAS concerned planned hours
rather than effectively attended hours.

received this training. The members of this academy (130 to date)
were involved in defining the Group’s strategic directions for the
new 2016/2020 cycle to closely interweave our economic and
human project over the next five years.

The purpose of the “Quality Academy” established in 2014 is to
support the management line in the transformation of the Quality
culture. It enables awareness to be raised in relation to the overall
Quality strategies and the central role of the customer. It is aimed
at managers and business managers working on “We all have a
role to play in customer satisfaction” as part of the “Customer
First” programme. 110 managers from the departments of offering
development, customer relations, supply chain management,
product manufacturing and provision as well as quality have
benefited from this Academy since its inception.

A third Academy, “Business in Motion”, was created in 2015, and
primarily involves managers in the Business Areas of marketing &
communication, product development, and controlling. The
purpose of this Academy is to develop a common language, and
offers tools to evaluate, prioritise, build and launch new business
opportunities. The Academy was rolled out in France and Asia in
2016 covering about 140 managers.

EMBODYING SOMFY ATTITUDES

First of all, the Somfy Spirit described before Social Information, is
a powerful tool to highlight and explain the managerial approach
expected within Somfy Group.

It is also through the development of key HR business processes
—Annual Performance Management, People Review, Talent
Review, Grading — supported by dedicated solutions, that Somfy
Group continuously measures both individual and collective
performance to serve its corporate project. The aims of the entire
system are to guide and enhance the development of resources
to make them a lever of commitment and attractiveness both
internally and externally.

This is to ensure that Somfy DNA and values are well respected
and shared by all, so that personal performance benefits the
competitiveness of the entire Group.

The Somfy Foundation also helps to advocate the Group’s values
and to join forces with staff members in ten countries since 2016.
More details are provided in Societal Information.

Annual Performance Management

For Somfy, each employee contributes to the creation of value
by implementing the Group’s strategy, which is translated into
collective and individual goals. They do so by applying the Somfy
Spirit principles, and through skill development.

During their annual appraisal, each employee can have an open
discussion with their manager, away from everyday constraints.

MM SOMFY -

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

It is a unique opportunity to review the position, gauge strengths

and areas for improvement, assess the year’s activity, as well as

to set specific goals together with the means to achieve them and

their evaluation criteria. At Somfy Group the dialogue between

manager and employee concerning performance and personal

development is a particular point of focus.

Somfy has developed a new Annual Performance Management

(APM) tool which was rolled out this year to 862 employees of

the Group. The managerial principles of Somfy Spirit have been

detailed in a skills framework applicable to all managers. This skills

framework enables a diagnosis of the soft skills required for the

position by identifying the strengths and development priorities

of the employee.

This new tool covers 33 countries, 25 of which are in the 2016 CSR

scope (Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, China, Czech Republic,

France, Germany, Greece, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Morocco,

Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden,

Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey, United Kingdom and USA).

It thus makes it possible to:

— ensure employees adopt strategic goals, and to specify their
actual contribution to these goals;

— allow the manager to talk about the meaning of the employee’s
goals by putting overall challenges into perspective;

— set SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Ambitious, Realistic, and
Timed);

— ensure consistency between individual and collective goals;

— ensure proper application of Somfy Spirit operational and mana-
gerial principles.

People Review

The People Review uses as input data the strategic issues of each

scope, their translation in the target organisation, and elements of

the annual appraisal, namely:

— overall performance level;

— skills identified in the employee;

— employee’s development potential as identified by their line
manager.

The People Review is a special occasion for collective decision-

making, bringing together for the same scope the Human Resources

Manager and other managers involved in the organisation’s

challenges (organisation charts, vacant positions, risk of knowledge

loss, etc.) and employee development.

It allows the adoption of short and medium-term scenarios

covering the development of people and organisations, as well as

the action plans incorporating these decisions. It is a demanding

exercise that requires combining career development aspira-

tions, employee skills (both technical and behavioural), and the

company’s future requirements.

Talent Review

Once the People Reviews has been carried out locally at each
scope, a Talent Review is organised at Group level. Its input data is
the Group’s overall strategic issues, their translation into the target
organisation, and elements from the People Reviews.

A unique opportunity for collective decision-making, the
Talent Review brings together at Group level Human Resources
Management and Executive Committee members to discuss
the organisational challenges and preparation of high-potential
employees for a managerial role.

In 2016, succession planning was launched at Group level in order
to identify key positions and potential successors in the event of
a vacant position, and to build action plans aimed at preparing
high-potential employees for management positions in the
medium- and long-term.

Remuneration: Project to categorise management positions

Extensive streamlining work has been ongoing within the Group
since 2014 to identify the various positions. The aim of this Grading
(or classification) project is to assess the burden of responsibility
of each position within Somfy, by accurately describing each role
and the skills it requires. This work, carried out gradually, is neces-
sary to improve fairness, particularly in relation to supporting and
assessing different employees. This was supplemented by a more
transparent vision in relation to the remuneration and employee
benefits to which everyone may be entitled.

Until 2016, the Grading project has involved assessing bench-
mark positions for Somfy SAS and for the Asia-Pacific Business &
Marketing Area, analysing internal equity of remuneration within
Somfy’s gradings, comparing Somfy’s remuneration levels with
market practices, and communicating with managers. Its imple-
mentation provides managers with a common tool to monitor
their management teams (remuneration and benefits).

In conclusion, the 2016 Human Resources roadmap focused on
Better living together remains ambitious, and in 2017 will leave its
place to, amongst others, the driver of Better Together, which is more
involved and integrated into the new strategic and human project. As
with Let’s in its time, this project will provide direction and set targets.

ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION

The 2016 CSR scope covers, among others, seven of the eight
factories located around the world, representing 76.4% of the
Group’s industrial workforce.

NATURE OF ACTIVITIES, ASSOCIATED RISKS AND
MEASURES TAKEN

The activities of the sites are of tertiary, industrial and logistical
natures.

Industrial sites mainly perform product assembly operations from
plastic and metallic components and circuit boards sourced from
outside the sites. Assembly operations do not produce gas emis-
sions, liquid releases or substance discharges, with the exception
of packing waste and possible manufacturing scrap which are
subject to selective sorting and recovery.

There are no machine operations generating waste material.
There is no specific noise pollution generated by the industrial sites
affecting local residents. Indeed, operations are situated inside the
buildings and mainly consist of the assembly of small parts.

Given the type of activity, there are no risks relating to food wastage.
The different sites are subject to classification levels compliant
with local regulations in relation to pollution or nuisance risks that
these facilities are likely to create.

The French sites are subject to an authorisation scheme for storage
in covered warehouses and a registration scheme for compression
facilities and installation of accumulators for recharging fork-lift
trucks.

There are no facilities that correspond to the maximum level,
“Authorisation with encumbrances — (AS)3” commonly known as
“SEVESO”.

Conclusions on the nature of activities, associated risks

and measures

For these reasons, the risk of air, soil, water and noise pollution
is low or non-existent. This report does not therefore provide any
information on these subjects.

In relation to these risks of pollution or nuisance that Somfy
Group’s sites are likely to create and the preventive measures
introduced, the amount of provisions and guarantees for environ-
mental risks is nil.

Given this low level of environmental risk on these sites, there
are no specific resources deployed. The measures introduced are
managed by the Facilities Departments of the sites.
04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

In 2015, the priority given in previous years to eco-design was
confirmed by the launch of the Act for Green® label, which desig-
nates products that meet eco-design requirements.

This priority can be traced back to the results of a Bilan Carbone®

(carbon assessment) carried out in 2012”°. This carbon assessment

had established work on electricity consumption and the use of

raw materials as priorities.

In 2015, three products were launched on the market with this Act

for Green® label.

2016 saw the confirmation of this commitment with the certifica-

tion of three new products: Roll up 28 WT, Eolis 3D RTS and Situo

Variation.

Act for Green® is based on a framework taken into account by

Research & Development teams. It incorporates requirements that

are broken down according to several subject areas:

— Controlling greenhouse gas emissions through moderate elec-
tricity use and the choice of appropriate raw materials,

— Seeking to use recycled and recyclable raw materials in the
composition of products,

— Materials selected for their low impact on health and the
environment,

— Product durability,

— Anavailable statement of the environmental impacts in line with
the PEP ecopassport® programme in which Somfy participates.
This programme, developed by the electricity industry, defines
a standardised method for making environmental declarations
in accordance with international regulations (ISO 14025 &
ISO 14040s). The information contained in this PEP ecopassport®
has been independently verified by Bureau Veritas CODDE.

Specific initiatives regarding internal communication were carried

out, aimed at Research & Development and marketing teams in

particular, for the purpose of including these eco-design require-
ments in all stages of product creation and commercial launch.

A roadmap for the integration of projects in the Act for Green®

programme had been drafted for the next three years.

Requests, both customer and regulatory, in relation to under-

standing the substances used in our products have intensified.

Work has been undertaken with the development of procedures

and the completion of analyses to confirm the conformity of Somfy

products with the REACH and ROHS European Directives.

Somfy has a Sustainable Development Department. This

Department integrates the resources and skills necessary for the

completion of projects that come under the heading “Planet”.

The Sustainable Development Department rolls out its policy by

working with the teams concerned in Somfy Group’s various sites

and businesses.

In 2016, Somfy Group continued to implement measures to reduce

the environmental impact of its sites:

— At Somfy SAS:
¢ Actions stepped up in terms of mobility, particularly through
the Mobil’Arve programme in Haute-Savoie (France), aimed at
reducing the impact of commuter pollution in a zone covered
by an air pollution plan. A “Mobility Challenge” day aimed at
changing commuting practices saw the participation of more
than 30% of employees present;
¢ Car-pooling site in Haute-Savoie (France). 196 Somfy employees
use this private community to easily find a co-driver amongst
their colleagues (up 46 employees compared with 2015);
¢ The measures introduced under the partnership with Corabio
made it possible to achieve the target of serving 16% local and
organic products in Somfy’s company restaurant in Cluses (up
6% compared with 2015);

e Reuse of laptops: 236 products handled in 2016 including
138 computers. The update and removal of computer data
is performed by a company promoting the employment of

disabled people. These computers and various accessories are
then reused, thereby breathing new life into them. In 2016, 99%
of the equipment was reusable, with the remaining 1% sent for
recycling.

— The SOPEM factory in Poland has an environmental policy based
on the following areas:
¢ conserving natural resources,
¢ contributing to sustainable development,
© cooperating with partners for environmental protection,
¢ improving energy efficiency.

— In Italy, BFT has an ISO 14001 certified structure. Instructions
on the sorting and reduction of waste in manufacturing zones
have been implemented by internal “environment experts” and
employees responsible for waste management. This happens
through meetings and general communication with staff or
information campaigns. Measures have also been implemented
in relation to eco-design with priority accorded to reducing the
energy consumption of products, to packaging and recyclable oils.

Internal communication initiatives continued in 2016 in support of

corporate initiatives. They took the form of articles in the various

in-house magazines, both in digital and paper format (for example,
in the in-house magazine “Tam-Tam”), information meetings at the
sites or internal seminars.

Communication themes addressed mainly focused on the Act for

Green® programme.

Simu SAS carried out an energy audit that detected potential to
improve compressed air production in the factory.

The energy audit carried out by Somfy SAS confirmed approaches
already taken in previous years concerning modernisation of
thermal comfort and insulation systems, and the replacement
of fluorescent lighting by LEDs. The work is being carried out in
gradual instalments as workshops and offices are renovated.
SOPEM’s new production hall, built in 2016, has also been
equipped with a LED lighting system that saves 60% energy
compared to conventional lighting. In 2016, SITEM saw its first full
year of lighting using this technology.

At the WAY site in Italy 100% of electricity used now comes from
renewable production sources. The energy is purchased from
Metaenergia who guarantee that its origin is solar, wind, or
geothermal.

Raw materials

Somfy has incorporated requirements aimed at minimising the

depletion of raw materials in its Act for Green® framework:

— Use of packaging materials with a minimum of 50% recycled
fibres;

— Use of recycled paper in product instructions;

— Ensuring products can be repaired as much as possible;

— Ensuring durability of remote controls with products resistant to
cumulative shocks.

Regarding the collection and processing of end of life products,

in 2013, Somfy implemented measures for professional sector

products, which represented most of the volume put on the market.

In France, Somfy signed a contract with RECYLUM, an organisation

authorised to process professional WEEE. This is the result of an

industry approach in which Somfy Group was a stakeholder.

In 2016, Somfy continued in its efforts in this area through working

within the various professional bodies to improve the industry. In

order to anticipate certain regulatory and legislative developments

concerning the Eco-Design European Directive (ERP), Somfy has

invested in a project led by RECYLUM that aims to propose a

method for calculating the rate of recyclability of products.

Since late 2015, SITEM has set up a reusable metal packaging

system with its tube supplier, which saves an estimated 67 tonnes

of cardboard annually.

36

LAND USE

There are no mining operations on any Somfy Group’s sites.

Our plants have regular HOSHIN or 5S workshops in order to
optimise the footprint of the sites. A team of specialists, integrated
into the Group’s Industrial Department, is dedicated to leading
these projects at the Group’s plants.

CLIMATE CHANGE

Our industrial activities do not present any risks linked to climate
change, whether they relate to the growing scarcity of water, rising
sea levels or the rise in temperature.

Somfy uses the results of a carbon assessment®” to determine
significant greenhouse gas emission generated by the company’s
activity, in particular through use of the goods and services that
it produces.

This carbon assessment carried out on scopes 1, 2 and 3 and on
the Somfy SAS scope has helped prioritise the various causes of
greenhouse gas emissions. This assessment was carried out with
the help of Eco2 Initiative.

The items of product electrical consumption (use-usage) and raw
materials (inputs) both account for 85% of Somfy SAS’s green-
house gas emissions.

These two items relate to products manufactured and thus to
industrial site activity.

Since the nature of industrial site activity is identical and has not
changed since 2011, the Somfy SAS carbon assessment is repre-
sentative of all the Group’s industrial sites. The emissions of
various items are proportional to the activity of each industrial
site. The ranking of greenhouse gas emissions is therefore deemed
to be the same between 2011 and 2016, and at all sites.
Quantities manufactured by Somfy SAS accounted for 25% of all
quantities produced by the Group in 2011.

This led to the establishment of the Act For Green® programme
described in the “General Environmental Policy” section. As this
programme applies gradually to all products and markets, it leads
to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions across all production
sites.

However other items, such as transport or energy consumption,
are not neglected, with mobility programmes at Somfy SAS, or
energy consumption reduction initiatives at sites (see the Energy
section in this report).

CO, emissions from emissions related to electricity, gas and mineral
fuel production represented 6,373 tonnes of CO,** in 2016.

PROTECTION OF BIODIVERSITY

The SOPEM factory in Poland is located on the edge of protected
sites belonging to the Natura 2000 network:

— Puszcza Niepolomicka PLB 120002,

— Torfowisko Wielkie PLH120080.

Somfy SAS owns several sites in the heart of the French Alps,
near Mont Blanc. Somfy wants to act to protect the mountain’s
eco-systems and is involved in local initiatives such as the “Club
d’Entreprises pour la Montagne et son Développement Durable”
(CEM2D) (Club of businesses supporting the mountain and its
sustainable development). A charter was notably developed in 2013.

SOCIETAL INFORMATION

TERRITORIAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACT

Consideration of the local impact of the company’s activity in
relation to employment and regional development

Leader in its business sectors, Somfy Group achieved growth,
which in 2016 had a positive impact on both direct and indirect
employment across all the regions in which it operates, as
suggested by the 6% increase in the Group’s workforce. In 2016,
all of the Group’s operations and regions reported Sales growth for
the second consecutive year.

As was the case the previous year, the strong development of
the Eastern Europe region resulted in the recruitment of staff at
the SOPEM factory. This development of local employment was
accompanied by a transfer of Group knowledge and skills. In 2016,
Somfy Group continued to have a positive impact on employment
in France, where its activities have traditionally been located.

The Group prioritises the local recruitment of senior executives and
employees, as this offers advantages in terms of the understanding
of local issues and cultures which is essential in particular in the
residential sector. The recruitment of local executives in the
factories also enables management to be more discriminating and
better adapted culturally not only during social dialogue but also in
terms of performance improvement.

The desire to favour local recruitment within the Group is
equalled by the emphasis which is placed on our commonalities,
first and foremost the Somfy Spirit corporate culture that was
communicated to the entire Group during two connected events,
one of which was specifically designed with factory and logistics
staff in mind. The document, published in 17 languages, is now
given to all newcomers, along with the company’s strategy and its
Ethics Charter.

Moreover, the Group wants production sites to be autonomous in
their methods and their supply. The sites have autonomy in their
choice of suppliers from a panel jointly constructed and managed
by Group Purchasing. The aim is to maintain consistency in the
purchasing strategy whilst going as far as possible to ensure local
implementation in relation to sub-contracting and supply. This
openness is beneficial to the Group which in return benefits from
successful local initiatives which can then be rolled out elsewhere.
Group policy aimed at ensuring Research and Development (R&D)
centres are located close to production centres and the main
consumer-dense areas led in 2015 to the creation of two R&D
divisions - in China for curtain motorisation and in Poland for
motorisation of exterior venetian blinds. SOPEM’s R&D division
was inaugurated in 2016.

Consideration of the impact on neighbouring
and local populations

In order to promote regional development, Somfy Group
participates in and supports higher education establishments in
the Rhéne-Alpes region. In 2015, Somfy Group became a founder
member of the Université Savoie Mont Blanc (USMB) Foundation
alongside the Assemblée des Pays de Savoie (regional government)
and the Université Savoie Mont Blanc Business Club. This selection
forms part of the longstanding relationship between the University
and Somfy, which has continued since the creation in 1991 of
the Club des Entreprises, of which Somfy’s Paul Dreyfus was the
inaugural chairman. Somfy is working alongside the University
to bring the academic world closer to the business world. This
is the aim of the University-created Foundation. Thus, as part
of this Business Club, the University has links that help identify
opportunities for its students who are looking for professional
training contracts.

37

Moreover, since 2012, the Group has chaired the Board of the Ecole
Polytech Annecy Chambéry, the University’s engineering school. In
total, 38 graduates of the University have stated they have worked
for Somfy during or after their studies, 12 of whom hold a Master’s
degree. In 2016, Somfy provided financial support for the 5%
edition of PolyNightWork, an annual competition organised by the
Polytech schools, held in Annecy this year.

As preparing future generations is a priority area for Somfy Group’s
Human Resources, it was also in this context of openness and
local ties that in 2016 Somfy SAS welcomed over 300 pupils and
students from schools and universities in the region and further
afield, as well as more than 140 association members, sharing
Somfy’s working practices with them along with staff members’
enthusiasm for their profession.

Somfy Group is heavily involved in competitiveness centres and
technology clusters active in the Arve valley (Haute-Savoie), where
the Group’s historical sites are located. Somfy is particularly active
in the Competitiveness Division of Mont-Blanc Industries, where
it mixes with a number of leading and successful mechatronics
businesses such as Altran-NSI, NTN-SNR, Seb-Téfal, Staubli,
etc. Somfy is involved in Thésame, a technology network for
mechatronics businesses and MIND, a Public Interest Group and
innovative Franco-Swiss platform specialised in the mechatronics
field. Mechatronics is the synergetic and systematic combination
of mechanics, electronics and real time computing, and is at
the heart of Somfy’s expertise. These collaborations enable the
company to be committed to local industrial development whilst
continuing to benefit from the input of skills and innovations into
our design and industrialisation processes.

In 2014 in particular, Somfy Group launched the research and
development project COMETE (Cloud pour la maison intelligente
et l’efficacité énergétique / Cloud for the smart home and energy
efficiency), whose purpose is to develop home automation
systems aimed at improving the energy efficiency of buildings. The
project brings together nine partners, businesses and research
laboratories from the Rhéne-Alpes region. COMETE is financially
supported by the FUI (Fonds Unique Interministériel), the Rhéne-
Alpes Region, the Haute-Savoie and Isére departmental councils,
and the Communauté de Communes (federation of local councils)
of Grésivaudan. After three years of this project’s development,
Somfy Group believes that COMETE will lead to the creation of 40
local jobs.

In 2016, Somfy’s presence on the Executive Board of Mont-
Blanc Industries Competitiveness Division led the company’s
participation in a certain number of brainstorming sessions about
the development of the Division’s means of action within the
framework of the NOTRe law (New Territorial Organisation of the
French Republic).

On a different note, the Group has a role of director within
the Board of Directors of the Arve Mont Blanc Intercompany
Occupational Health Service, whose purpose is to promote and
encourage the prevention of occupation risks in the Vallée de
Arve, action which involves the health and safety risks for Group
employees being better taken into account.

Somfy Espafia SA has been a member of the Catalonia Energy
Efficiency Cluster (CEEC) since 2012. The CEEC is an association
where it is possible to establish links between members (over 100
members*’) and create new relationships, partnerships, and even
new business (lobbying). Several working groups exist within the
association; Somfy participates in four of them including one called
“Low-emission and net-zero-energy buildings (for professional
use)”. This working group was responsible for drafting the “Energy
rehabilitation of buildings” document??, which Somfy worked on
from September 2015 onwards, in partnership with the Catalonian
government and other companies, before it was published in
October 2016.

RELATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS

Conditions for dialogue with stakeholders

The Group annually reviews its communication plan in relation to
its stakeholders, to ensure they are kept regularly informed and to
facilitate as much as possible constructive discussions in relation
to the Group’s strategy and management with the stakeholders
identified as priorities: employees, shareholders, investors,
customers, users, suppliers and regional governments. We distin-
guish between customers, a term that refers to the professionals
or distributors who buy and sell, integrate, or install our products;
users, a term that refers to the end users of our products, whether
they are the customers of our customers, users of our solutions in
offices or communal facilities, or consumers buying our products
on our websites.

The social section of this report summarises all the developments
and improvements made as part of the dialogue with employees
and social partners.

Being responsive to professional customers is a strategic priority
for Somfy Group and it is structured within a programme called
“Customer First”. For each customer profile, Somfy Group has
developed dialogue-based activities — studies, surveys, training,
services — tailored to the expectations of these stakeholders.
Users are regularly consulted as part of the development of our
new offers. A forum moderated by Somfy gives them a voice in
France. Other users can reply to questions — this is the case for
80% of answers — as well as company employees. 120,000 ques-
tions are consulted each month by those using this forum, which
received almost 967,000 visits in 2016, representing 80,600 unique
visitors per month. This allows our hotline to be more efficient and
to answer calls more quickly and has led to productivity gains in
this telephone support service.

Involved in the development of the areas in which the Group is
located, Somfy Group has led dialogue in France with the various
levels of public decision-making to contribute to action in the
areas of education, employment, research and development, or
to support cultural and sporting projects for local people, by trying
where possible to replicate these events within the company
for the benefit of employees. These programmes include the
Mont-Blanc Photo Festival (Pays du Mont-Blanc), Salon du Livre
Esperluette (Cluses), Musiques en Stock (Cluses), Pleins Feux
Festival (Bonneville), MB Race (Pays du Mont-Blanc) and various
sports clubs (Cluses). This collaboration can take the form of
patronage or sponsorship, since the visibility of Somfy’s initiatives
by Group employees or local residents is one of the aims of this
commitment.

Acts of support, partnership or sponsorship

Action to support top young athletes

In 2014, Somfy created Somfy Ski Talents, a sponsorship programme
for top young skiers, which as well as financially supporting young
athletes, offers to help them, where applicable, to prepare for their
transition into, or in finding out about, the business world. Thus
in 2015, Jonas Devouassoux completed a placement at the R&D
centre. Lastly, we help young athletes to build their reputations by
passing on their news via our social networks.

A citizen’s policy involving employees

Somfy Group is committed to improving the living conditions of
all, and the company’s Foundation was established in 2004 to
support this worthwhile cause. The latter’s activity really took off

38

after 2011 when a dedicated team was set up, a larger budget was
allocated, and it refocused its actions on housing issues. Since then
it has pursued its civic action, helping people live together better,
and fighting against poor housing.

The Foundation is now a philanthropic organisation in its own
right, both in terms of financial and human contributions. Both
initiatives are implemented through the international programme
A House is A Home and the crowdfunding platform Les Petites
Pierres*.

In 2016, the Group gave the Foundation almost €300,000, and
strengthened the operational team by recruiting an additional staff
member.

Les Petites Pierres

The endowment fund Les Petites Pierres is an online crowdfunding
platform*. It enables anyone to donate to community projects in
the area of access to decent housing. In 2016, the platform enabled
47 new projects to be funded (i.e. 93 projects since its inception in
2013), for an amount of €173,000 topped up by the Group, which is
18% more than the previous year. The threshold of €1 million for the
benefit of non-profit organisations was thus crossed during the year.
In addition to project financing, non-profits also receive assistance
with digital skills learning, thereby helping them to independently
leverage their various communities and other partners.

A House is A Home

Because it is both important and socially responsible to make a
commitment in the countries where the company operates, the
Somfy Foundation is now working with ten non-profit organisa-
tions fighting against inadequate housing in ten different countries
(Brazil, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Lebanon, Poland, China, United
States, Australia, France). Poor housing is a problem experienced
worldwide. As an international company, Somfy wishes to make
its own contribution by ensuring decent housing is available to as
many people as possible.

The Somfy Foundation, through its socially-responsible commit-
ment, gives real substance to the values of responsibility, openness
and respect for the company. The A House is A Home programme,
started in January 2015, started working with new regions in 2016.
The same goals are at the heart of both the A House is A Home
and Les Petites Pierres programmes: steadily forging the bonds
of humanity that form the basis of a balanced society, developing
lasting relationships, and working hand-in-hand with community
partners identified as stakeholders and project leaders. This helps
promote the values of solidarity within the company.

Employee involvement

Personal philanthropy is at the service of the programmes A House
is A Home and Les Petites Pierres.

Established in France, for Somfy SAS, in 2016 this personal philan-
thropy saw the skills and energy of 165 employees donated to
non-profit organisations over the course of 62 days of solidarity.
They were 117 in 2015, an increase of 41%, demonstrating the
interest shown by employees in this programme.

In addition, internationalisation of the Foundation’s actions has
been made possible thanks to the very active involvement of
Somfy’s subsidiaries. The latter have taken both financial and
human commitments: they have organised their HR and legal
framework in order for their employees to be involved in solidarity
initiatives during working hours.

To cite just one example, a partnership between the NGO Habitat
for Humanity in Poland, Somfy’s Polish subsidiary, and the Somfy
Foundation helped a multigenerational family who were living in
substandard conditions near Krakow.

04 MANAGEMENT BOARD REPORT

Somfy Foundation is thus one of the very few (1%) of foundations
surveyed by Ernst & Young who carry out actions both in France
and abroad*.

SUB-CONTRACTING AND SUPPLIERS

Suppliers and sub-contracting are important for Somfy Group due
to the nature of its industrial activity which is essentially assembly.
Indeed, all the components that form part of the composition of
the products are purchased components.
In order to make progress in relation to responsible purchasing,
Somfy Group, in collaboration with other manufacturers, has
developed a maturity frame of reference in relation to collective
and responsible purchasing: this framework incorporates the
central issues of the standard, ISO 26000.
This work was carried out within the framework of PEAK, a business
Research and Training network aimed at developing collaborative
customer-supplier relationships.
Somfy Group has begun to introduce measures to make sure that
its suppliers and sub-contractors are socially and environmentally
responsible. Thus, Somfy has auditors who assess suppliers prior to
their admittance to the panel. These audits are conducted on the
basis of a questionnaire that includes questions on the following
topics:
— Existence of an environmental policy,
— Organisation to ensure that products conform to environmental
requirements,
— Existence of a health and safety policy and consideration of
ergonomic and safety aspects in the design of workstations.
These questions are rated, with the ratings forming part of the
final assessment score of the supplier. If significant variations are
discovered, relating for example to safety in the workplace, Somfy
Group may ask the supplier to take corrective action.
For every component developed by a supplier, Somfy Group
requests a written undertaking relating to the European Directives
REACH and ROHS.
In accordance with the regulations adopted by the US Securities
and Exchange Commission in 2012, Somfy Group implemented its
duty of diligence in respect of its supply chain, in order to ensure
that the supplies used in its products do not contain any “Conflict
Minerals”.

FAIR PRACTICES

The roll-out of the Ethics Charter was launched in September 2015
and continued, as planned, in 2016. The majority of Somfy Group
employees have now been informed of the existence of the Charter
and its contents, and have been made aware of and trained in its
ethical concepts by their managers.

“As it continues to grow, Somfy Group benefits from greater visi-
bility in many countries and on increasingly diversified markets.
This development is generating new challenges and imposing
new demands. Protecting the reputation of the Group therefore
requires us to reinforce our need for exemplary behaviour in our
day-to-day activities. Our leadership position on several of our
business sectors and our ambition for the future imply greater
responsibilities, which we readily accept. And the success of our
business will not last unless we clearly assert our requirements as
an ethical and responsible business.

In this context, Somfy Group has drawn up an Ethics Charter which
will become a point of reference in terms of individual and group
behaviour, and will guide our day-to-day activities. We want to
make this a Charter that brings people together, and share our
aspirations with the men and women who join our Group.”*°

corporate philanthropists, Ernst & Young, September 2016 survey based on
a panel of 632 foundations.

39

This Charter divides our principles into five areas:
— Compliance with legislation and regulations,
Upright behaviour,

Respect for people,

Integrity towards our customers and
our business and financial partners,
— Responsibility towards society and the environment.

It is a common and unifying document based on a single set of
principles applicable to all Somfy Group employees in each of its
constituting entities. This Charter is also a tool for the promotion
of dialogue between employees so that ethics is an open matter
understood by all.

To facilitate its circulation, it has been translated into 19 languages,
and 30 ethics contacts have been appointed within the Group’s
different companies. Supported by managers, they can be
consulted in the event of an ethical conflict or dilemma. An Ethics
Committee has been set up to lead the process in relation to all
the Group’s ethical issues and to handle any alerts that may be
reported via a dedicated and secure email address. A dedicated
e-learning platform and a deployment kit complement this
system; the package is accessible to the Group’s managers, who
are responsible for ensuring its roll-out and applying its principles
within their scope.

Somfy Group and its employees particularly seek to respect the
regulations of the countries in which it operates in relation to
organisation of work, whilst subscribing to the principles and
objectives of the fundamental conventions of the International
Labour Organisation (ILO) and by aiming to adopt the practices of
a responsible and management respectful of everyone.

This is reflected in a commitment to:

— Respect differences, improve diversity and reject discrimination;
Reject any kind of harassment, notably moral and sexual;
Ensure the health, safety and decent working conditions for the
company’s employees and partners;

— Seek to develop the skills and employability of staff;

— Seek the professional development of employees;

— Guarantee constructive social dialogue.

The Group’s Ethics Charter reaffirms the fact that the company
rejects all illegal child labour and the use of forced labour, seeks
to establish constructive social dialogue and rejects all forms of
discrimination and corruption, whether active or passive.

MEASURES PROMOTING CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

Ensuring the safety of the users of its products is a top priority for
Somfy Group. Alongside other leading companies in the electrical
industry and the building shutters sector, Somfy Group is heavily
involved in standardisation in order to ensure that the good
safety practices implemented in relation to product development
are maintained. This action operates on an international (IEC
standards), European (CENELEC and CEN standards) or local (UL
standard for the United States for example) scale. To show that
its products comply with safety standards, Somfy products are
accredited by independent bodies in its different territories (VDE,
NF, SASO, UL, etc.).

Somfy Group acquired a Quality Management System enabling
it to ensure that its products comply with the standards
and requirements in place within its markets. To control the
performance and safety of the installation of its products, Somfy
Group has developed a network of expert installers throughout the
areas in which the Group is located. These specialists benefit from
professional training to help ensure that the products are installed
under optimum safety conditions both for the installer and users.
Every product is accompanied by usage and safety instructions.
Somfy publishes online manuals on its websites. They are available
on 38 of our sites intended for users of our solutions (also on our
sites for professionals) and are translated into between 12 and
18 languages depending on the product listing. In addition, 32
YouTube channels around the world broadcast presentations on

products and their operating instructions, usage tips, and even
demonstrations on installation and programming.

The Quality Management System is the backbone of performance
for Somfy Group: it must enable each employee to become a
regular advocate of customer satisfaction. In order to respond
to Somfy’s development, customer expectations and those of all
stakeholders, the Group’s Quality Management System has been
revised. Based on the Group’s core values and principles, it aims
to implement an ongoing drive of continuous improvement at the
service of performance and customer satisfaction. It is intended
to be simple, used and useful, and able to meet high standards
as and when necessary. Independent of any organisations, it
clarifies cross-company operations and promotes cooperation.
This system is the common foundation that accommodates all. It is
incumbent upon teams to elaborate on it and make it work in their
own context.

Thanks to the outstanding work accomplished with a Quality
project that has gradually been deployed across the Group, one
of the tangible results directly affected consumers as customer
returns have seen a 25% decrease in the past two years.

METHODOLOGY NOTE
REPORTING PROTOCOL

Somfy Groups’ CSR reporting protocol is the reference guide for all
those involved in CSR reporting within the Group. It is drawn up
in French and English. Its purpose is to define all the Group’s CSR
indicators along with their method of calculation, and to describe
the procedures for their collection and for reporting in order to
promote the consistency and comparability of data. This document
is distributed to and applied at all levels of data preparation and
reporting. The reporting protocol is updated annually to take into
account Group developments.

The CSR reporting protocol also serves as a reference framework
for the external verification of data, in accordance with Article
L. 225-102-1 of the Commercial Code (“Grenelle 2” Law). It is
available on request from Head Office.

SELECTION OF INDICATORS

Somfy Group’s indicators were defined by the CSR officers for each
area in line with the Group’s CSR strategy and the resulting social,
environmental and societal objectives. They facilitate the moni-
toring of the CSR policy’s progress in each of the improvement
areas identified by the Group and the transparent communication
of the Group’s CSR performance in this report.

The indicators used comply with the Grenelle Il decree and are
based on the general principles of the GRI (Global Reporting
Initiative) guidelines.

COLLECTION, INTERNAL CONTROL AND CONSOLIDATION

The collection of CSR indicators is ensured by the CSR officers
within their respective fields of expertise. They rely on their
network of local experts who provide the data. The CSR officers
are also responsible for monitoring the consistency and plausibility
of the data prior to its consolidation in order to generate the Group
indicators included in the CSR section of the management report.

40

REPORTING PERIOD

The data collected covers the period from 1 January to 31 December

2016.

Depending on the indicators, it can relate to:

— An annual consolidation of the data from 1 January 2016 to
31 December 2016,

— The data measured at 31 December 2016.

Where historical information is available, data is reported on the

last two financial years.

REPORTING SCOPE

According to Article L. 225-102-1 of the Commercial Code,
are included within the reporting scope companies which are
controlled by the Group and fully consolidated within the financial
reporting scope. The concept of control means the power to govern
the financial and operational policies of an affiliated company so as
to benefit from its operations. Control is generally deemed to exist
where the Group holds more than half of the controlled company’s
voting rights.

For reasons of organisation and access to information, all Group
companies have not yet been included. The Group wants to use
perimeters that are more relevant depending on the topics covered.
Thus, certain companies are excluded from the social scope due
to the existence of very low workforces in certain organisations
(distribution subsidiaries spread out over vast geographic areas
such as South America), or the lack of Human Resources infor-
mation systems designed for collecting data easily. To overcome
this last difficulty, an international information system is currently
being deployed within the Group’s main companies, its aim in the
long run being to cover all Somfy regions and companies.

The distribution subsidiaries are excluded from the environmental
scope due to their low environmental impact in comparison with
the industrial sites.

In the short term, the Group plans to integrate all significant
companies that it fully owns. Only one company, Dooya, owned at
70% and comprising an industrial site, is not integrated. The CSR
scope workforce covers 76.8% of the Group’s total workforce in
2016.

Newly acquired companies are integrated into the reporting scope
following a probationary period necessary for the introduction of
reporting.

Companies which were sold during the financial year are not
included within the reporting scope.

METHODOLOGY LIMITATIONS

The methodologies used for the reporting of certain CSR indicators
may present limitations due to:

— Particularities of local legislation in the various countries in
which the Group is located,

Lack of availability of information on certain scopes,

Use of estimates in the absence of assessment tools,
Practicalities of collecting and processing data.

AUTHORISATION TO BE GRANTED TO THE
MANAGEMENT BOARD FOR THE BUYBACK BY THE
COMPANY OF ITS OWN SHARES PURSUANT TO
ARTICLE L. 225-209 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE
(resolution 12)
A share buyback plan for a period of 18 months will be submitted
for your approval. This plan would replace the current programme,
which would be terminated early. It would allow management to
purchase up to 10% of the shares of the company, if necessary
restated for any potential capital increase or decrease transactions
that may be carried out over the timeframe of the programme. The
objectives of this programme would be:

— To stimulate the secondary market or ensure the liquidity of the
Somfy share, by way of an investment services provider within a
liquidity contract that complies with the Ethics Charter of AMAFI
recognised by regulations, it being specified that within this
framework the number of shares considered for the calculation
of the limit specified above corresponds to the number of shares
purchased less the number of shares resold;

— To retain the shares purchased and subsequently exchange
them or use them as payment within the framework of potential
acquisitions;

— To ensure the coverage of stock option plans and/or free share
allocation plans (or similar) granted to employees and/or
corporate officers of the Group, as well as all other shares allo-
cated under a company or group savings scheme (or similar),
in relation to employee profit-sharing and/or any other form of
allocation to employees and/or corporate officers of the Group;

— To cover marketable securities giving right to the allocation of
company shares, in accordance with applicable regulations;

— To proceed with the possible cancellation of shares acquired,
subject to the authorisation granted by the General Meeting of
shareholders of 24 May 2016 in its eleventh resolution, sitting in
extraordinary session.

The company would reserve the right to use options or derivative

instruments, in accordance with applicable regulations.

We propose to set the maximum purchase price at €600 per share.

The maximum value of the transaction, taking account of the

532,707 treasury shares held at 31 December 2016, is therefore

set at €124,375,800.

DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO BE GRANTED TO
THE MANAGEMENT BOARD FOR THE PURPOSE

OF SPLITTING THE PAR VALUE OF SHARES
(resolution 13)

You will be asked to set the par value of the shares in the company
at €0.20 and, consequently, to split each share with a par value of
€1, by exchanging these shares at a transfer rate of five €0.20 shares
against one €1 share, it being specified that this division would take
effect on a date set by the Management Board.

It is specified that the double voting right, as provided for by the
provisions of Article 29 of the bylaws, is allocated upon the issue of
registered shares of €0.20 resulting from the division of registered
shares of €1 bearing this right, the stipulated period of four years not
being interrupted by the exchange.

The €0.20 shares would unconditionally replace the €1 shares which
would be cancelled, and this exchange will not result in a change in
the relationship between the company and its shareholders.

You will be asked to approve this delegation and authorise the
Management Board to carry out this exchange on a date following
the dividend payment date, determine the number of existing
shares, amend the bylaws accordingly and more generally, do all
that is necessary to implement these decisions no later than the end
of the General Meeting held in 2018 to approve the financial state-
ments for the previous financial year.

mine their remuneration. Management Board members are
appointed for a term of four years which will cease at the end of

INFORMATION ON PAYMENT TERMS
(ARTICLE L. 441-G-1 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

At 31 December 2016 as at 31 December 2015, there were no liabilities due but unpaid to Somfy SA suppliers.
Trade receivables specific to Somfy SA’s activity represent payment terms generally less than 45 days from the end of the month.

INFORMATION ON RISKS

(ARTICLE L. 225-100 OF THE COMMERCIAL CODE)

FINANCIAL RISKS

The main financial risks to which the Somfy Group is exposed are
foreign exchange rate, interest rate, and liquidity and investment risks.
According to IFRS, all derivative financial instruments are
measured at their fair value. Fair value is either the market value
for listed instruments, or a value provided by financial institutions
in accordance with traditional criteria (over-the-counter market).
The amounts covered exclusively relate to current or future trans-
actions within the framework of Somfy Group’s normal business
activities.

As part of the transposition of the MIF Directive that came into
force on 1 November 2007, Somfy SA and its French subsidiaries
opted for the “individual clients” category.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

Somfy Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily
related to its operational activities (intragroup sales of manufac-
tured products distributed by commercial subsidiaries outside the
Euro zone, these sales being denominated in local currencies and
purchases denominated in local currencies).

At comparable terms and conditions, the Group gives priority to
natural hedges (foreign currency purchases related to sales in the
same currency). The derivative financial instruments put into place
are forward foreign exchange contracts for the main currencies.
The management of foreign exchange risk is covered in Note 7.3 to
the consolidated financial statements.

INTEREST RATE RISK

Somfy Group is exposed to risks associated with the effect of fluc-
tuation in interest rates. Management of the interest rate relative
to Group debt is based on consolidated position and market condi-
tions. The primary objective of the rate risk management policy is
to control Group financing costs.

The management of the interest rate risk is covered in Note 7.3 to
the consolidated financial statements.

LIQUIDITY RISK

Somfy Group must have permanent access to the necessary finan-

cial resources to allow it to finance its day-to-day activities and

its investments. The Group’s liquidity risk primarily arises from

the obligation to repay its existing debt, the funding of its future

requirements and observance of its financial ratios.

The granting of credit facilities is subject to Somfy SA’s commit-

ments to its banking partners to comply with two types of financial

covenants based on:

— The Group’s financial structure (net financial debt/shareholder’s
equity) and,

— Its ability to repay (net financial debt/cash flow and net financial
debt/EBITDA).

The management of liquidity risk is covered in Note 7.3 to the

consolidated financial statements.

Credit facilities and compliance with covenants are detailed in

Note 7.2.2.6 to the consolidated financial statements.

46

INVESTMENT RISK

The Group’s exposure to investment risk is related to its cash
surplus deposited with banks.

The management of investment risk is covered in Note 7.3 to the
consolidated financial statements.

RAW MATERIAL RISKS

Somfy Group hedges against the volatility in the price of raw mate-
rials that are significantly used in the manufacturing of its products
by placing firm orders with its suppliers, depending on market
conditions.

SHARE RISKS

The Group is exposed to equity risk on treasury shares. Given the
share price, it was not necessary to record a provision for write-
down at 31 December 2016.

LEGAL RISKS

Somfy Group’s operations are not subject to specific regulations.
Its business does not require a specific legal or regulatory authori-
sation with the exception of the compulsory listing in the Register
of Companies and stock exchange regulations.

Somfy Group is involved in a number of disputes in respect of its
business. These should not have any significant negative impact on
the Group’s financial position.

To the Group’s knowledge, there were no exceptional events or
litigation likely to have a significant negative impact on the Group’s
or its subsidiaries’ operations, assets or results, other than those
mentioned in the highlights of the financial year.

INSURANCE — RISK COVERAGE

Somfy Group covers the main risks with the following insurance

policies:

— “Property damage”, covering buildings and their contents
(equipment, goods, IT equipment) up to the maximum amount
of damage likely to be incurred;

— “Resulting loss of profit”;

Risks insured by these two policies include, fire, explosions,

lightning, smoke, emissions, steam, impacts from airborne

objects, electrical risks, storms, snow, hail, water damage, frost,
machine breakage, IT equipment theft, natural disasters and other
non-designated events;

— “General civil liability relating to monetary consequences of
an insured entity’s liability following physical injury, property
damage or moral prejudice caused to a third party during or in
relation to its operations”;

— “Corporate officers’ civil liability”;

— “Transported goods”;

— In addition, credit insurance contracts, both in France and inter-
nationally, mitigate the consequences of customer default.
Approximately 75% of sales are covered by such contracts.

of Group sales. The management of credit risk is covered in Note 4.5 to the

consolidated financial statements.

CLIMATE RISK

Due to the nature of the products marketed (notably motors for
blinds), Somfy Group’s activity is partly connected to weather
conditions, in particular during the first half of the year, during
which sales of motors for blinds are concentrated.

INFORMATION ON NON-DEDUCTIBLE CHARGES
(ARTICLES 39-4 AND 223 IV OF THE GENERAL TAX CODE)

The financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2016 do not include any non-allowable charges with regard to the
income tax base, as defined by Articles 39-4 and 223 IV of the General Tax Code.

ALLOCATION OF NET PROFIT

The Management Board proposes to allocate the net profit of €119,374,767.93 for the year ended 31 December 2016, increased by
retained earnings of €3,054,202.50, to a total of €122,428,970.43, as follows:
— Allocation to shareholders of a gross dividend of €6.10 per share,
being €6.10 x 7,400,000 shares €45,140,000.00
— Transfer to optional reserve €77,288,970.43

€122,428,970.43
A gross dividend of €6.10 will be distributed for each share with a par value of €1, and this carries the right to a tax rebate granted to
individuals subject to income tax in France, in accordance with Article 158-3-2° of the General Tax Code.
Shares held by the company on the ex-dividend date are not entitled to dividends, with the corresponding amount of unpaid dividends
being transferred to retained earnings.
The dividend will be payable on 6 June 2016; the shares must be held on 2 June 2017 (ex-dividend date).

In accordance with legal provisions, it should be noted that the following dividends were paid during the last three financial years:
