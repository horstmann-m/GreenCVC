Profile

1.1 Profile

11.1

With operations in over one hundred
countries and endowed with a strong
entrepreneurial culture, Bouygues has
firm foundations on which to pursue its
development on markets with long-term
growth potential.

With 120,000 employees, the Bouygues group operates in three sectors
of activity: construction (Bouygues Construction, Bouygues Immobilier
and Colas), media (TF1) and telecoms (Bouygues Telecom). It is also the
leading shareholder in Alstom (transport).

11.11 Strategy

Bouygues is a diversified industrial group whose activities aim to bring
innovative solutions to as many people as possible, through infrastructure
via its construction businesses and through digital technologies elsewhere.

Bouygues draws on the skills and expertise of its people to add value to
the products and services it offers in each of its business segments. The
Group aims to strengthen its position as a global player in construction,
energy and transport infrastructure, maintain its leading position in the
French media industry and support the spread of digital technologies in
the telecoms sector for the benefit of customers and end-users alike.

11.1.2 Strengths

A stable ownership structure

Bouygues’ largest shareholders are its employees and SCDM, a holding
company controlled by Martin and Olivier Bouygues.

m= Nearly 60,000 employees own shares in the Group, confirming
Bouygues as the CAC 40 company with the highest level of employee
share ownership. Employees owned 21.4% of the capital and held
28.6% of the voting rights at 31 December 2015;

m= SCDM owned 20.4% of the capital and held 27.9% of the voting rights
at 31 December 2015.

The presence of stable and strongly committed shareholders enables
Bouygues to take a long-term approach to strategy.

A diversified industrial group

A strong culture

Project management expertise is a distinguishing feature of Bouygues’
culture, and its management approach based on empowerment is founded
on the values of respect, trust and fairness shared by its five subsidiaries.

A focus on stable long-term markets

Very substantial infrastructure and housing needs exist worldwide,
and there is increasing demand from customers for sustainable
construction (passive or positive-energy buildings, etc.) and sparing
use of resources. Bouygues has developed acknowledged expertise in
these areas, which distinguish the Group from its rivals, affording it a
competitive edge and enabling it to grow strongly on international markets
(Bouygues Construction and Colas generated 52% of their sales outside
France in 2015).

French telecoms and media markets will continue to expand, with future
growth being driven by rapid technological advances and changing uses.

A robust financial structure

Bouygues knows how to keep its capital expenditure under control while
generating free cash flow on a regular basis. It carries little debt and has
a very substantial cash surplus.

Drawing on these strengths, Bouygues has paid out a regular dividend to
shareholders. The average dividend yield was 4.6% in 2015.

Key dates in
the Group’s history

THE GROUP
Profile

11.4 Open Innovation

11.4.1 The Bouygues group’s
Open Innovation policy

towards start-ups

Complementing its R&D effort, Bouygues has decided to promote
Open Innovation focusing on partners outside the group. Building
relationships between the Group’s business segments and start-ups is a
key aspect of this policy.

Open Innovation hand-in-hand with start-ups enables the Group’s
businesses to draw on nimble and visionary enterprises in exchange for
commercial contacts so that they can:

™ use cutting-edge products and services to differentiate themselves
from competitors;

™ prepare for the future and test new and potentially disruptive business
models.

The policy also leverages innovation by providing substantial external
financial resources and spreading risk. Preference is given to start-ups in
the seed phase because that is where innovation is strongest and the most
influence can be brought to bear in order to guide products or strategies
and meet the start-up’s need for completed projects to show prospects.

Two conditions must be fulfilled for Group businesses to establish a robust
partnership with start-ups:

= the product or service in question must create value within the business
backing the start-up;

= the business must be confident that the start-up has a long-term future.

In order to meet the second condition, the Group has set up an investment
arm with the aim of safeguarding start-ups by providing equity and
expertise on how to run a business.

The following organisation was gradually put in place in 2015:

= business segments are entirely responsible for choosing the start-ups in
which they decide to invest and for creating their own investment funds;

m Bouygues Développement, attached to Bouygues SA, is the Group’s
advisory and management arm. It draws on the venture capital
experience gained with Bouygues Telecom Initiatives, created in 2008,
in order to coordinate, prepare and manage investments in the start-ups
chosen by the business segments.

Bouygues Construction

Bouygues Construction’s Open Innovation policy has three strands:

m the Matching Up platform to identify new start-ups and quickly start
trials;

= Minute Start-Up events in order to showcase successful prototypes;

= Construction Venture, Bouygues Construction’s investment fund,
which takes equity interests in start-ups to support and sustain their

12  BOUYGUES | 2015 Registration Document

development. A first investment was concluded with Bouygues Immobilier
in November, with the acquisition of a stake in Intent Technologies, a
company specialising in connected buildings.

Bouygues Immobilier

Bird (Bouygues Immobilier R&D) is Bouygues Immobilier’s venture
capital subsidiary. Awarded the Frenchtech label, it has a dual strategy:
to strengthen existing lines of business with innovative products and
services (MyCloud3D, Intent Technologies), and to keep pace with
emerging trends such as coworking (YAD Initiatives), smart parking
(BePark) and crowdfunding (Lymo). As well as establishing closer relations
with Open Innovation ecosystems in France, such as The Family in Paris
and Tuba in Lyon, and in other countries, Bird also finances the projects
of in-house entrepreneurs hosted in the internal coworking centre called
“La Ruche”.

Colas

Colas has created CIB Développement, an investment fund for start-ups.
Its first investment was in Anyces, a start-up developing a mobility
management solution. Colas is also a founding member of the Paris&Co
incubator dedicated to logistics and sustainable urban mobility.

TF

In 2015, TF1’s innovation unit set up a mechanism to support start-ups
at any stage of development, from the concept phase to both incubation
and fundraising.

TF1 has launched its own corporate incubator with Paris&Co and has
selected eight start-ups that operational staff will help to develop new
services and markets. TF1 has also entered into technology partnerships,
especially in “360-degree” and 4K coverage (4K is the new HD standard).

Bouygues Telecom

The key themes in 2015 were the internet of things, building customer
loyalty, the Android TV ecosystem, services that generate value added
from the very-high speed mobile network, and technical enablers.

BTI (Bouygues Telecom Initiatives) has been involved in three co-
developments:

= Talentroc: a collaborative knowledge-sharing platform that encourages
cooperation between the company’s employees. It will now be rolled
out company-wide;

= Abeeway: object geolocation services suited to the low-speed network
rolled out by Bouygues Telecom using the LoRa technology (see
opposite);

= Matriss: property asset optimisation services, via the reduction of
energy bills.
11.4.2 Innovations, new markets

and cooperation

Wattway

The Wattway solar road unveiled by Colas in Paris in October 2015 is the
outcome of a five-year cooperative R&D project at a joint laboratory with
CEA Tech at Ines (the French National Solar Technology Institute) based
at Chambéry in south-east France.

Operating in project mode and pooling their expertise, the highly motivated
team was able to draw on complementary contributions from partners
from two apparently very different worlds to design and test a solar panel
incorporated into the road surface.

Now that their respective senior managements have renewed the joint
laboratory agreement for another three years, the teams from CEA Tech
and Colas will be able to continue their work with the aim of giving
road surfaces new functions, combining smart road technology with
responsible development.

Nextdoor

Nextdoor is the new collaborative work space concept launched by
Bouygues Immobilier in Issy-les-Moulineaux, just south of Paris, in
June 2015. It was an immediate success, so the initiative will be repeated
in the coming months. The ingredients for success are founded on a good
sociological match with user expectations:

= a flexible and user-friendly working environment;

= an entrepreneurial mix in a community of tenants comprising start-ups,
SMEs and large firms, stimulating creativity;

™ an ecosystem of start-ups which both provide and use services for
the community.

Objenious, Bouygues Telecom’s subsidiary for the
Internet of Things

In the promising field of the internet of things, Bouygues Telecom has
chosen LoRa, a technology expected to become a global standard that is
currently being rolled out on a dedicated nationwide network. Objenious,
a Bouygues Telecom subsidiary created in 2015, will start offering services
in early 2016. It has already carried out several trials of uses ranging from
energy management and the allocation of heating costs to vehicle fleet
management.

Colas is very much involved in these matters at present and is working with
Objenious on smart solutions to make life easier for city dwellers. Issues
related to the sustainable city, such as smart homes, street lighting and
energy consumption management, are expected to very quickly arouse
interest in LoRa technology across all the Group’s business segments.

B’in Motion

In order to play a driving role in the use of BIM (Building Information
Management), a tool that fosters collaborative working between all those
involved in the construction process, Bouygues Construction has given
its BIM team the go-ahead to begin the second phase of their project.

THE GROUP
Profile

The team’s missions are to:

= step up the rollout of BIM in all phases of construction (design, studies,
works, operation), especially by training employees and partners;

= monitor developments in BIM software worldwide by maintaining close
relationships with major vendors and testing products from a variety
of SMEs and start-ups;

= taking part in the work of standardisation bodies in France and Europe.

Le Spot, a successful partnership between
Bouygues and Epitech 3. Le Spot Bouygues is an
open innovation space that Bouygues created on the
Epitech campus in 2014. The aim is to get students to
think about issues facing the Group in its various lines
of business and to develop operational prototypes using

innovative technologies. Since its inception, around
40 students have used Le Spot Bouygues to carry out
over a dozen projects, including the use of smart glasses
for authentication on worksites, different usage scenarios
in a smart stadium, a drone piloting assistance system
and the use of smart watches to interact with TF1.

11.4.3 Organisation of innovation

in the Group

Respecting the independence of each business segment, the Group’s
innovation organisation has the following characteristics:

= a large number of grassroots initiatives, sometimes on the same
subjects;

= aquick transition to the trial phase in order to get feedback from users
and dispel risks;

= business-specific strategic priorities underpinned by organisational
structures suited to the specific nature of each business segment.

The parent company has two support structures:
= e-lab, its in-house research and innovation unit;

= Bouygues Développement, to conduct financial assessments and
monitor equity interests in start-ups (See section 1.1.4.1).

e-lab

Through its knowledge and understanding of new technologies and its
network of partners, e-lab helps subsidiaries design innovative products
and services. These include, for Colas and Bouygues Construction,
improving site workers’ productivity by incorporating digital technology
into equipment such as hard-hats and clothing; for Bouygues TP, a
contactless payment system for the new bridge in Abidjan (Ivory Coast);
and for Bouygues Telecom, the rollout of a pilot network for the internet
of things in a French town.

(a) Epitech is a French IT university created in 1999 offering a five-year computer science course. TF1 became a partner in September 2015.

BOUYGUES | 2015 Registration Document 13
THE GROUP
Profile

Its second mission is to facilitate exchanges with elite universities and e-lab also coordinates innovation in the Group and fosters synergies
other industrial firms. The Ideas Lab in Grenoble is a prime example, between subsidiaries. It organises many exchanges between business
bringing together the CEA, Grenoble-Alpes University and major French segments within the Bouygues Innovation Network through seminars,
industrial firms such as Air Liquide, Engie, Leroy Merlin and Suez. Projects committees, conventions and field trips.

in 2015 concerned work on driverless vehicles (trials of uses, impact on

cities), connected operators and fuel poverty.

THE GROUP
2015 financial year

Sales

Sales generated by the Bouygues group
reached €32.4 billion in 2015, 2% lower than in
2014, and 5% lower on a like-for-like basis and
at constant exchange rates.

The construction businesses reported 2015
full-year sales (net of internal transactions) of
€26.0 billion, down 2% on 2014. Exchange
rates and (to a lesser extent) external growth
had a positive effect year-on-year. On a like-
for-like basis and at constant exchange rates,
sales were therefore down 6% year-on-year. As
expected, French sales reflected weakness in the
domestic market, falling by 8% to €13.7 billion.
International sales reached €12.3 billion, up
6% versus 2014 but down 4% on a like-for-like
basis and at constant exchange rates. These
figures are not a true reflection of the buoyant
state of the Group’s construction businesses
in international markets, given that numerous
recently-signed contracts are still at the start or
in their early stages.

Bouygues Construction reported sales of
€11,975 million, up 2% on 2014, but down 6%
on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange
rates. Sales at Bouygues Immobilier were

(a) Average Revenue Per User

SALES BY REGION

€$2,428M

€2,304 million, a year-on-year fall of 17%. As
expected, this reflects the sharp fall in residential
property reservations in 2012/2013, and a tough
comparative in commercial property. Finally,
sales at Colas amounted to €11,960 million, 4%
lower than in the previous year. Sales slipped by
8% in France, hit by a sharp contraction in the
roads market and by the discontinuation of the
base oils activity at the Dunkirk refinery (SRD).
However, international sales were 2% higher
than in 2014.

TF1 reported sales of €2,004 million, 11% lower
than in 2014. The main factor was the impact of
the deconsolidation of Eurosport. After stripping
out this impact, sales at TF1 fell only slightly
year-on-year.

Sales at Bouygues Telecom returned to
growth in 2015, rising by 2% year-on-year to
€4,505 million. Although sales from network
fell slightly over the full year (down 1% at
€3,825 million), they returned to growth in the
second half of 2015 thanks largely to repricing
of the mobile subscriber base and a stabilisation
of mobile ARPU?.

Current operating profit/(loss)

The Bouygues group posted current operating
profit growth of 6% in 2015, to €941 million.

Current operating profit for the construction
businesses was €831 million, while current
operating margin held steady year-on-year at
3.2% despite the fall in sales. Current operating
margin at Bouygues Construction was stable at
2.9%, but at Bouygues Immobilier it hit a low
point of 6.0% in 2015 (0.3 of a point lower than
in 2014), reflecting the drop in sales. At Colas,
a strong performance from the Roads business
internationally offset the effects of contraction
in the French roads market and losses at the
Dunkirk refinery (SRD). Colas reported a slight
increase in current operating margin to 2.9%,
0.2 of a point higher than in 2014.

TF1 posted current operating profit of
€158 million, an increase of €15 million relative to
2014, largely due to a reduction in programming
costs. Current operating margin reached 7.9%
in 2015, up 1.5 points year-on-year.

After undergoing an in-depth transformation,
Bouygues Telecom achieved its objective of
improving EBITDA in 2015. A good commercial
performance during the year in both mobile and
fixed broadband, combined with cost savings
derived from the transformation plan, helped
push EBITDA up €58 million year-on-year to
€752 million. There was also an improvement
at current operating level, with the loss reduced
from €65 million in 2014 to €11 million in 2015.

After €273 million of non-current charges
essentially related to network sharing with
Numericable-SFR, the discontinuation of the
Dunkirk-based subsidiary SRD, and adaptation
plans in all business segments, Group
operating profit for 2015 came to €668 million.
For information, the 2014 operating profit figure
included €245 million of non-current income.

Net profit attributable to the Group €emition

Net profit attributable to the Group
amounted to €403 million in 2015, compared
with €807 million in 2014. For information, the
2014 figure included a number of exceptional
items, in particular the net capital gains on
the disposals of the stakes in Cofiroute and

2014 2015

Net debt stood at €2,561 million as of
31 December 2015, versus €3,216 million a
year earlier. The 2015 year-end figure does not
include the net proceeds of €996 million from
the Alstom public share buy-back offer, which
were not received until January 2016.

Operating activities generated a net cash inflow
of €547 million in 2015, €168 million more than in
2014, thanks to improved profitability and tight
control over the working capital requirement.

Outlook for 2016

The cash outflow on dividends was €539 million
higher in 2015 than in 2014, reflecting the fact
that the dividend was cash only (as opposed to
2014, when 79.1% of the Group’s shareholders
opted to take their dividend in the form of
shares).

In addition, proceeds from exceptional disposals
during 2015 reduced net debt by €672 million,
most of which came from the finalisation of the
agreements between TF1 and Discovery (net
amount: €476 million).

Trends in net debt (or net surplus cash) at
business segment level were as follows:

= Net surplus cash held by Bouygues
Construction improved further, and stands
at the very high level of €3,272 million
(€372 million more than at the end of 2014),
thanks to very careful management of
working capital needs;

= Netsurplus cash held by Bouygues Immobilier
is €198 million lower year-on-year at €5 million,
reflecting (as expected) the lower level of
residential reservations in 2013 and 2014;

= Netsurplus cash held by Colas is €560 million,
down €122 million year-on-year following an
exceptional dividend payout of €372 million;

= TF1 holds net surplus cash of €701 million;
this represents a year-on-year increase of
€204 million, due mainly to the proceeds from
the sale of the stake in Eurosport.

= Net debt at Bouygues Telecom stands at
€890 million, €125 million higher than at
the end of 2014, mainly as a result of cash
outflows relating to the non-current charges
booked in 2014.

Net debt at “Holding company & other”
level stands at €6,209 million, a year-on-
year reduction of €524 million, reflecting the
redemption of a bond issue that matured in
July 2015.

Bouygues has a credit rating of Baa1/stable
outlook from Moody’s, and BBB/stable outlook
from Standard & Poor’s.

The Group has excellent liquidity (€8.9 billion at
31 December 2015, comprising €3.6 billion of
cash and cash equivalents and €5.3 billion of
undrawn credit facilities), and a very well-spread
out debt maturity schedule.

Thanks to the strategy of transforming its business segments, the Group
should continue to improve profitability in 2016.

The construction businesses will continue targeted growth in international
markets and broaden their portfolio of offers with innovative products and
services in both their existing markets and new market segments. Their
profitability is expected to improve starting in 2016.

TF1 will capitalise on the Newen acquisition to expand further into content
production. It will also step up its digital transformation and adapt the
business model of its channels.

Bouygues Telecom, within the context of its standalone strategy, has
confirmed its target of a return to long-term growth in sales and profits. It
has an EBITDA margin target of 25% for 2017 with a plan to save at least

22  BOUYGUES | 2015 Registration Document

€400 million in 2016 versus end-2013. Capital expenditure is expected to
reach €750-€800 million in 2016.

At the same time, Bouygues is continuing the discussions announced
on 5 January 2016 in view of a merger between Bouygues Telecom and
Orange that would bolster its long-term presence in the telecoms sector.
In all the discussions it pursues, Bouygues attaches great importance to
the interests of Bouygues Telecom’s employees and to the momentum of
sector investment, which must remain strong in the interests of customers.

The roll-out of network sharing with the Numericable-SFR group combined
with adaptation plans in the business segments are likely to result in
non-current charges of around €200 million which will affect the Group’s
operating profit in 2016.
13.2 Highlights

On 11 January, Colas acquires six jointly-owned or jointly-operated
companies in the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar. Specialised in

road construction, they operate with a number of major, high-profile partners
(Al Futtaim, Al Zawawi and Midmac) in each of the respective countries.

On 14 January, Colas announces the discontinuation of its sales and

of innovative and collaborative work spaces for businesses),
Bouygues Immobilier announces the opening of two new sites totalling
9,000 m’ to encourage “a new approach to working” in the Paris region’s
two biggest business districts - Coeur Défense (a major business
district in the western suburbs of Paris) and Issy-les-Moulineaux. With
1,200 collaborative workstations and 3,000 planned by the end of 2016,
Nextdoor confirms the pertinence of its model designed to encourage
the growth of companies and the well-being of those who work for them.

On 2 February Colas signs a contract to sell (subject to a number of
suspensory clauses) its 15.6% stake in Atlandes (the company holding
the concession to the A63 motorway) to the investment funds HICL and
DIF. The lifting of these suspensory clauses and the divestment should
take place at the start of 2017.

On 3 February La Poste Immo chooses Bouygues Batiment Ile-de-France,
a Bouygues Construction subsidiary, for the la Poste du Louvre contract.
This symbolic building belonging to the French post office, located in the
heart of the 1st arrondissement of Paris, is preparing for a major renovation
project which began at the beginning of 2016.

On 9 February, Logement Francilien, Entreprise Sociale pour |’Habitat
(ESH) of Groupe Logement Frangais, a key player in social housing, team
up with Bouygues Immobilier, a leading private property developer in
France, to prepare the radical transformation of “Les Indes” neighbourhood
in Sartrouville, to the north-west of Paris. For the first time a social landlord
and a property developer will be pooling their expertise to design a new
look for this neighbourhood, which is one of the priorities of France’s
urban planning policy.

On 10 February, the “Réinventer Paris” jury awards Linkcity, the property
development subsidiary of Bouygues Construction, and its partners the
contract to develop Triangle Eole-Evangile in the 19th arrondissement of
Paris. This symbolic site, which is the biggest in the “Réinventer Paris”

first “zero carbon” district.

On 8 March, Bouygues Construction announced the handover of the
biggest solar farm in South-east Asia, with a total output of 132 MWp,
on Negros Island in the Philippines. Work began in May 2015. More
than 425,000 panels were installed over a surface area of 170 hectares.

26  BOUYGUES | 2015 Registration Document

The power plant, which is connected to the national grid, will produce
190,000 MWh per year, equating to the annual average consumption of
170,000 Filipino households.

142 Media and Telecoms

On 2 February, Bouygues Telecom announced the creation of Objenious,
a subsidiary dedicated to the Internet of Things, in order to market
products and services to businesses. Objenious will exploit the LoRa

ultimately connect millions of objects. The entire network will have been
rolled out by the end of 2016.

On 12 February, Bouygues Telecom announces that it has boosted its

19 February 2016.

14.3. Bouygues SA

On January 5, Bouygues announces that preliminary discussions have
started with Orange to look at the possible options that would allow it to
secure its long-term presence in the telecoms sector.

In accordance with the agreements concluded with the French government
on 22 June 2014 in order to allow the sale of Alstom’s Energy business
to General Electric, Bouygues loaned the French government, at end-
January 2016, 43.8 million Alstom shares (representing 20% of Alstom’s
capital) for a duration of around 20 months.

14.4 Alstom

In January, Alstom announces the success of its public share buy-back
offer aimed at distributing to shareholders a part of the proceeds of the
sale of its Energy business to General Electric. More than 230 million
shares were tendered to the offer. After application of the reduction
mechanism, 91.5 million shares were repurchased by Alstom, representing
29.5% of its capital. The board of directors approved the cancellation of
the repurchased shares equating to around €3.2 billion, thus reducing
the number of shares to around 220 million and the company’s market
capitalisation to €5.4 billion at market close on 28 January 2016. Following
this public share buy-back offer, Bouygues owns 62.1 million shares
representing 28.3% of the capital of Alstom (see section on Bouygues SA
above).

On 12 February 2016, Alstom and Bouygues Travaux Publics announced
the signing of a contract with Light Rail Manila Corporation (LRMC) to
upgrade and extend line LRT-1 of the Manilla metro in the Philippines. The
contract amounts to nearly €450 million, with Alstom’s share standing at
around €160 million. The line’s extension should open for operation in 2020.

2.1.21 Profile

Growth strategy and opportunities

Being attentive to customers enables Bouygues Construction to develop
relationships of trust with them and to support them in their projects, within
the context of its sustainable development policy.

Bouygues Construction’s strategy is based on a number of priorities:

= being an end-to-end player in order to span the entire construction
industry value chain from financing through design-build to operation
and maintenance;

= incorporating sustainable construction into the entire project lifecycle,
taking account of all the technical, environmental and social issues;

= offering distinctive, high value-added products and services,
giving priority to innovation in all its forms. BIM (building information
modelling), for example, offers customers a 3D view of their future
project, providing effective decision support;

= consolidating its positions in France, which remains the company’s
largest market, while developing international operations by
strengthening synergies between business segments on target markets
that offer attractive growth prospects;

= strengthening its property development activities, drawing on its
specific network, Linkcity?, to offer optimum solutions for enhancing
the value of property assets;

= forging strategic partnerships with businesses which possess
complementary expertise in order to devise comprehensive solutions
in response to increasingly complex challenges;

= rolling out specific products and services for industrial customers
in order to better meet their needs for energy efficiency and guaranteed
performance;

= promoting cross-disciplinarity at all levels of the business, firstly by
strengthening synergies between Bouygues Construction entities by
pooling resources and skills.

Cross-disciplinarity also involves partnerships with suppliers and
subcontractors, and may involve taking equity interests in innovative
start-ups through the Construction Venture investment fund launched
in 2015.

Lastly, Bouygues Construction aims to capitalise on cooperation
between Bouygues group businesses to offer high value-added
products and services. Its partnership with Bouygues Immobilier on
eco-neighbourhoods is a perfect example.

To back up this strategy, Bouygues Construction can draw on:

= a commitment to ethical behaviour by managers and sales
teams with the aim of guaranteeing customers a high level of ethical
responsibility. Nearly 30,000 employees will again be made aware
of ethical issues in business relationships in 2016 through an online
training module called FairDeal;

= a commitment to employee health and safety with a single global
standard: the “zero accident” objective.

This aim is expressed in several initiatives, such as workforce training,
continuous improvement of construction methods, communication
campaigns, anti-addiction campaigns, road accident prevention, more
stringent on-site controls, etc.

Strengths and assets

Bouygues Construction has many strengths to draw on in all its business
activities.

= Differentiation through innovation at all levels of the company:

= technical innovation, especially with BIM, to industrialise processes
and operating methods while encouraging information-sharing in
order to make site work more efficient;

= commercial innovation in order to offer distinctive products and
services;

= managerial innovation, with continuous improvement of the
organisation of work and collaborative working in order to become
more responsive and more effective.

= A strong international presence: Bouygues Construction operates
worldwide on a long-term basis through well-established local
subsidiaries or on one-off, technically complex major projects. The two
approaches are complementary and give the company the necessary
flexibility to mobilise its resources quickly on high-potential markets.
Bouygues Construction generates over half its sales on international
markets;

= Long experience of managing complex projects: motivated people
with high-level technical skills enable Bouygues Construction to fully
meet the needs of public and private customers;

= The capacity to adapt to changing markets: the level of its order
book gives the company good medium-term visibility, enabling it to
adjust costs while focusing investment on the most buoyant markets;

= Apolicy of controlling operating and financial risks: strict application
of procedures at all levels of the company guarantees that the right
projects are selected and carried out smoothly;

= Robust financial performance: over the last ten years, Bouygues
Construction has demonstrated its capacity to generate sales growth
while preserving profitability, backed up by a healthy and robust
financial situation;

Market position

Given the organisational structure of its direct competitors, it is difficult to
make like-for-like comparisons between them and Bouygues Construction.

= In Europe: based on the 2014 ranking published by trade magazine
Le Moniteur in December 2015, the Bouygues group’s construction
activity is the third largest in Europe after the Spanish firm ACS
(Hochtief, Germany’s leading construction firm, has been a subsidiary
of ACS since 2011) and Vinci’s Contracting and Property Development
division, and ahead of the Swedish contractor Skanska and the French
contractor Eiffage.

= Inthe world: the Bouygues group’s construction businesses, comprising
its three construction subsidiaries, is placed seventh in the 2014 ENR

(a) Since 1 January 2016, the new brand name for Bouygues Construction’s property development subsidiaries.

32  BOUYGUES | 2015 Registration Document
ranking of international contractors published in August 2015, based
on the share of sales generated on international markets.

= In France: in a French building and civil works market worth about
€200 billion according to a Euroconstruct estimate in December 2015,
Bouygues Construction (excluding Bouygues Energies & Services) is
one of the top three French contractors ahead of Eiffage Construction
and behind Vinci Construction (2014 ranking published by Le Moniteur
in December 2015). The market also includes many small and medium-
sized firms. In energy and services, Bouygues Energies & Services
is in sixth place after Cofely (GDF Suez), Vinci Energies, Dalkia,
Spie and Eiffage Energie (2014 ranking published by Le Moniteur in
December 2015).

2.1.2.2 Business activity in 2015

Sustained commercial activity and a robust financial
structure

A HIGH LEVEL OF ORDER INTAKE: €11,971 MILLION

Order intake in 2015 amounted to a high €11,971 million. It included
17 contracts worth more than €100 million each, of which 13 were on
international markets.

Order intake in France amounted to €4,929 million. It included the
second phase of office buildings in the western corner of the Balard site
in Paris, phases 3 and 5 of the Nice tramway, the Sky 56 office building in
Lyon, renovation of the Longchamp racecourse, a teaching block on the
CentraleSupélec campus at Paris-Saclay, the renovation and extension of
a wastewater pretreatment plant in Clichy, north of Paris, the rehabilitation
of offices on the Boulevard de Grenelle in Paris and the construction of
property complexes in the Batignolles district of Paris.

Orders were 9% lower than in 2014 due to tough market conditions in
France. Another factor was the number of major projects in the 2014
order intake, such as the property development programme for the Stade
Vélodrome in Marseille, Lyon-Saint Exupéry airport and two buildings for
the Strasbourg teaching hospitals. However, the order intake for buildings
in the Paris region holds out good prospects for sales of new residential
buildings and projects under the ‘Grand Paris’ major infrastructure plan.

Order intake on international markets came to €7,042 million. Orders
included NorthConnex, a major motorway link in Australia, two sewage
tunnels in Qatar and projects to meet public and industrial needs for
renewable energies (a solar farm in the Philippines, biomass waste-to-
energy gasification plants in the United Kingdom). In Switzerland, business
activity remained strong in the housing segment, demonstrated by an
order for the L’Atelier complex in Geneva and several phases of Greencity,
an eco-neighbourhood in Zurich with “2000 Watts”® certification. In the
UK, there is still considerable demand for amenity buildings, such as a
cutting-edge cancer treatment and surgery centre commissioned by the
University College London Hospitals (UCLH) NHS Foundation Trust, and
the University of Cambridge exam board headquarters.

Buildings with environmental certification accounted for 72% of the order
intake, compared with 66% in 2014.

AN INCREASE IN THE ORDER BOOK GIVING LONG-TERM
VISIBILITY (€19.3 BILLION)

The order book at end-2015 stood at a high €19.3 billion, up 7% on end-
December 2014, with international markets accounting for 58%. Europe
(excluding France) and the Asia-Pacific zone are the two most important
international regions. Orders booked at end-2015 to be executed in 2016
amounted to €9.0 billion and orders to be executed beyond 2016 to
€10.3 billion, giving good visibility for future activity.

SALES GROWTH: €11,975 MILLION (+2%)

Sales rose by 2% in 2015 to €11,975 million, with building and civil works
accounting for 82% and energies and services for 18%.

Sales in France fell by 5% to €5,689 million, reflecting the slowdown on
the French construction market, and represented 48% of total sales.
Sales outside France rose sharply, up 9% at €6,286 million, driven by
vigorous activity at Bouygues Construction and favourable exchange rate
and scope effects (acquisition in Canada of Plan Group in August 2014
and of Gastier in July 2015).

Like-for-like and at constant exchange rates, sales fell by 6%.

ROBUST OPERATING RESULTS

Current operating profit came to €349 million, up €14 million versus 2014.
The current operating margin stood at 2.9%.

Financial income amounted to €26 million, down €10 million versus 2014.
Net profit attributable to the Group came to €276 million, up 9% versus
2014.

A STILL VERY SUBSTANTIAL NET CASH POSITION:

€3,272 MILLION

Although conditions in France remained tough, Bouygues Construction
improved its financial structure, with a net cash position of €3.3 billion
at end-2015.

Developments in Bouygues Construction’s markets
and activities

The world continues to have very substantial construction needs, especially
for urban rehabilitation and energy renovation, housing, transport, urban
infrastructure, energy infrastructure and amenities.

In industrialised countries, Bouygues Construction draws on its expertise
throughout the value chain to offer customers increasingly competitive
solutions for complex major projects. Emerging countries are more
dynamic due to factors such as high growth rates and sovereign wealth
funds, and Bouygues Construction can rapidly mobilise its resources on
these high-potential markets.

LEADING THE WAY IN SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION

Incorporating environmental factors into the design, construction,
operation and maintenance of structures, together with the use of
new renewable energies and energy renovation, are major challenges
worldwide.

(a) Energy consumption in Switzerland is currently 6,500 watts per capita (56,940 kWh per capita per year). This figure is to be reduced to 2,000 watts by 2100 (17,520 kWh per

capita and per year), more than three times less than the current level.

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
Construction businesses

Bouygues Construction designs and constructs smart grids and self-
sufficient buildings which use only renewable energy sources. It supports
industrial firms in the production of renewable energies and offers customers
innovative infrastructure such as connected eco-neighbourhoods,
biomass power plants and solar farms. Bouygues Construction has played
a pioneering role, carrying out the first renovations of modern commercial
buildings with HQE™ (High Environmental Quality) certification, of high-
rise office buildings such as Tour First in La Défense, of Haussmann-era
buildings with BBC-effinergie® low-energy certification and of buildings
with BEAM Plus?, BREEAM®® and LEED®* certification.

With its Réavenir initiative, Bouygues Construction also offers solutions
for reducing energy consumption in buildings while improving living
conditions for occupants. Réavenir is based on three commitments: to
respect the environment and residents, to engage in dialogue to ensure
active and participatory rehabilitation, and to guarantee performance.

The rapid spread of digital tools is another major development with an impact
on the construction industry. Since late 2014, Bouygues Construction has
supported digital transformation by rolling out BIM (Building Information
Modelling)‘ in all its entities. The technology will help the company become
more competitive and better manage increasingly complex projects.

Ethics and health and safety (especially the “zero accident” objective
on worksites) are inseparable from Bouygues Construction’s activity,
giving rise to awareness-raising and training initiatives in subsidiaries
(see chapter 3 of this document).

BUILDING AND CIVIL WORKS

In 2015, sales in the building and civil works segment rose to
€9,857 million, 2% lower than in 2014 (€10,049 million). Sales amounted to
€4,613 million in France and €5,244 on international markets (77 countries
at 30 September 2015).

France

Economic conditions in France remained generally tough. Capital
spending in the public and private sector continued to be affected by
pressure on government budgets and hesitation on the part of private and
industrial investors. The non-residential building and civil works segments
were particularly hard hit by the fall in public spending. However, political
measures to revive the housing market taken in late 2014 had a beneficial
effect and, according to a Euroconstruct forecast in December 2015,
hold out the prospect of a recovery in new housing construction in 2016.

The construction market in the Paris region is sustained by substantial
housing needs, the appeal of the capital and renovation projects to comply
with the requirements of recent environmental legislation (the Grenelle
Acts). Considerable potential for major infrastructure projects remains,
especially within the framework of the “Grand Paris” major infrastructure
programme.

In the rest of France, the building market remained under pressure, with
projects tending to become smaller. Gaining large-scale projects continues
to be a very long and very complex process.

2015 sales: €4,613 million (-6%)

In the Paris region, Bouygues Construction completed a number of major
amenity projects such as the Paris Philharmonic concert hall, renovation
of the AccorHotels Arena (formerly the Paris-Bercy sports complex) and

the French Ministry of Defence, a public-private partnership project. Work
is continuing on the Paris law courts complex and on the City of Music
in Boulogne-Billancourt.

Several commercial property projects were handed over, including the
Eole office building on the Evergreen campus in Montrouge, home to
Crédit Agricole’s new corporate headquarters, the Bouygues Immobilier-
designed Campus Sanofi Val de Biévre in Gentilly and the renovated
Tour Athéna in the La Défense business district of Paris. Commercial
activity in the segment was marked by a number of office rehabilitation
projects in Paris, in Rue des Archives, Rue Malakoff and Boulevard de
Grenelle.

The construction and rehabilitation of social and private-sector housing
held up well overall. In Paris, Bouygues Construction completed the
transformation of the former Laennec Hospital (6'" arrondissement of
Paris) into offices and flats and handed over Nouvelle Vague, a complex
including social housing and up-market apartments. The company started
construction work on several packages of the Batignolles complex in
Paris, comprising offices, social and private housing and shops.

Bouygues Construction once more reaped the reward of its expertise in
managing complex projects, taking an order from France Galop for the
renovation of the Longchamp racecourse. The project, designed by the
architect Dominique Perrault, includes deconstruction of the former stands
and the construction of a new 160-metre long grandstand.

Elsewhere in France, Bouygues Construction’s four regional building
subsidiaries were particularly active on the public-sector education and
culture markets, with projects including the renovation of the University of
Bordeaux campus, extension and rehabilitation of the fine arts museum
of Nantes and the handover in 2015 of five secondary schools in the
Loiret department of central France within the framework of public-private
partnerships.

In the healthcare sector, Bouygues Construction continued to build the
Belfort-Montbéliard hospital and two buildings for the Strasbourg teaching
hospitals. Work started on a new hospital at Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni in
French Guiana. In 2015, the company handed over the new hospital of
Orléans and a new cancer unit at Nimes teaching hospital.

In the private sector, Bouygues Construction took orders for the Sky 56
office building and handed over Tour Incity in the Lyon Part-Dieu business
district.

Work continued on major projects such as Lyon-Saint Exupéry airport
and the property development programme associated with the Stade
Vélodrome in Marseille.

In civil works, Bouygues Construction has regional branches all over
France that specialise in smaller-scale civil engineering projects and
earthworks. A specialist subsidiary carries out complex major projects
such as ongoing civil engineering works for the Flamanville EPR nuclear
power plant, the viaduct on the New coastal road on Reunion Island,
the Nimes-Montpellier railway bypass, the L2 Marseille bypass and the
second tunnel package of the Paris metro Line 14 extension project. New
public-sector orders during the year included phases 3 and 5 of the Nice
tramway and the renovation and extension of a wastewater pretreatment
plant in Clichy, north of Paris.

(a) BEAM Plus: Building Environmental Assessment Method (Hong Kong certification scheme)
(b) BREEAM®: Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (UK certification scheme)

(c) LEED®: Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (US certification scheme)

(d) Dynamic digital modelling software which enables users to design, virtually construct and visualise the project and involve stakeholders collaboratively before the structure

Europe

The construction market in Europe has been showing signs of recovery
since 2014, especially in Sweden, Ireland, the UK and some eastern
European countries (Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic).

In Western Europe, Bouygues Construction subsidiaries are particularly
active in the UK, where the market is worth approximately €200 billion,
and in Switzerland (approx. €55 billion). The UK construction market
is benefitting from the country’s return to growth. Local authorities are
concentrating their spending on improving the energy efficiency of their
housing stock. In Switzerland, although the construction sector slowed
slightly, a stable economy, stable employment and continuing low interest
rates mean that there are good opportunities to be grasped.

The new European investment plan, called the Juncker Plan, adopted on
24 June 2015, could have a beneficial effect on the construction market by
providing funding for sectors such as transport networks, energy transition
and energy efficiency.

2015 sales: €2,220 million (+5%)

Bouygues Construction’s activity in the UK was underpinned by urban
regeneration projects. The company continued work on the Canning Town
project in London and took orders for projects to renovate Addlestone
town centre in Surrey and the Gascoigne Estate in Barking, east London.
The Manhattan Loft Gardens project, the order for which was booked in
2015, will likewise play a key role in renewing and reinvigorating Stratford
in east London. The company also handed over Phase 2 of the University
of Hertfordshire campus.

Demand in Switzerland remained strong, especially on the housing
market. Bouygues Construction drew on its expertise in putting together
complex property development projects with stringent environmental
requirements: the company put the finishing touches to the Erlenmatt
eco-neighbourhood in Basel and continued work on Im Lenz in Lenzburg.
It took orders for L’Atelier, a property complex in Geneva, the Faubourg
1227 apartment complex at Carouge (Geneva), and several phases of
the Greencity eco-neighbourhood in Zurich. Bouygues Construction has
acknowledged expertise in multi-product projects that include offices,
shops, housing and leisure facilities, such as the Puls and Rex complexes
in Thun, handed over in 2015. The company also handed over offices for
the Swiss post office in Bern.

In Central Europe, Bouygues Construction has well-established positions
through local subsidiaries in Poland and the Czech Republic, which
continued to expand their building activities.

Elsewhere in Europe, Bouygues Construction is also involved on a one-off
basis in major infrastructure projects such as the new confinement shelter
for the damaged nuclear reactor at Chernobyl in Ukraine, which is being
built in partnership with Vinci, and Zagreb Airport in Croatia.

Asia - Pacific

Despite turbulence on Asian stock markets, construction markets in
the region are particularly dynamic, with continuing high growth rates.
Bouygues Construction benefits from its long-standing position in
Hong Kong, where it has been a player for 60 years, though local and
foreign competition is intensifying. Strong economic growth in Thailand
and Singapore is a stimulus for all sectors, especially construction. The
Australian economy, long buoyed by mining income, has found new
sources of growth in sectors such as agrifood and tourism. Attractive
possibilities also exist in some other emerging regions, though the risk
factor is high.

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
Construction businesses

2015 sales: €1,817 million (+7%)

Bouygues Construction has a strong local presence in the Asia-Pacific
region, especially in Hong Kong and Singapore. Civil works activity
continued unabated in Hong Kong. Several major projects are under
construction, including a section of the giant Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao
bridge, the dual two-lane sub-sea Tuen Mun-Chek/Lap Kok road tunnel,
two twin-tube tunnels for the six-kilometre extension of the Shatin to
Central Link metro line, and two 4.8-kilometre tunnels for linking the north-
east of Hong Kong to the Liantang boundary control point with mainland
China. The company delivered the XLR 820 and 821 rail tunnels on the
new Hong Kong to Guangzhou high-speed rail link.

Bouygues Construction is a recognised player on the Asian building
market, especially for high-rise structures. In Hong Kong, the company
handed over the Trade & Industry Tower in the Kai Tak district to the
government’s Architectural Services Department. In Singapore, work
continued on the Bishan and Buangkok condominium tower blocks.
In Bangkok, the company is building three residential tower blocks in
a highly desirable shopping district as well as the MahaNakhon tower
and the new Australian Embassy complex. In Macao, work continued
on a 39-storey, 6-star luxury hotel in the heart of the City of Dreams
entertainment complex.

In Myanmar, Bouygues Construction continued to establish its presence,
building the second phase of the Star City residential complex in
Yangon. In Australia, commercial activity was marked by the order for
the NorthConnex motorway link project in Sydney. The company also
handed over the North Strathfield rail underpass project in the same city.

Africa - Middle East

Economic growth remains fragile in North Africa, which has been
affected by social and geopolitical tensions and the resulting decline in
tourist revenue, compounded by the ongoing troubles of the euro zone
economies on which North African countries depend for much of their
trade. Growth has been strong in sub-Saharan Africa, driven amongst
other things by a massive influx of foreign capital. Oil-exporting Middle
Eastern countries are investing in major infrastructure projects, though
the falling oil price has started to cut their capital spending.

Overall, transport infrastructure needs and the exploitation of natural
resources make this a high-potential region for construction firms.

2015 sales: €773 million (-15%)

In Africa, Bouygues Construction’s building and civil engineering firms
work together on major infrastructure projects. In Egypt, after taking part in
the construction of Lines 1 and 2 of the Cairo metro, in 2015 the company
took an order for a new phase of Line 3. In Abidjan, Ivory Coast, it is
currently operating the Riviera Marcory bridge, one of the first concessions
in West Africa. Bouygues Construction is also building the Ridge Hospital
extension in Accra, Ghana. In Nigeria, it took an order to build the
corporate headquarters of Nigeria LNG, a company which produces
liquefied natural gas, and continued to build the Jabi Lake Mall in Abuja.

The company’s expertise in earthworks for opencast mining is illustrated
in its operation of gold mines at Kibali in the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Tongon in Ivory Coast and Gounkoto in Mali.

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
Construction businesses

Bouygues Construction is involved in roadbuilding projects in several
African countries in response to considerable demand. In Cameroon,
the company put the finishing touches to the Ngaoundéré-Garoua
road. In Burkina Faso, it carried out work to strengthen part of the
RN1 highway linking Ouagadougou to the western part of the country.
In Equatorial Guinea, it continued to build and develop the Bata seafront
road. In Chad, it continued work on the Sarh-Kyabé road in the south-east
of the country. In Gabon, it continued to upgrade the Ndjolé-Médoumane
highway.

In the Middle East, Bouygues Construction took an order to build two
sewage tunnels in Qatar as part of a strategic project to collect, pump
and treat wastewater in the south of Doha. It also continued work on the
Qatar Petroleum District in the same city, a vast complex that includes
nine high-rise office buildings.

Americas - Caribbean

The economic situation in the Americas is contrasted, differing very
considerably from one country to another. In the United States, growth
is mainly sustained by household consumption. Central and Latin America
remain very much dependent on economic conditions elsewhere. Canada
was affected by the falling oil price. Bouygues Construction subsidiaries
mostly operate in the United States, Canada and Cuba, with growth being
driven mainly by major amenity, infrastructure and hotel projects.

2015 sales: €434 million (-3%)

The Americas/Caribbean region is growing strongly. Bouygues
Construction has a long-term presence in Cuba, where it is a recognised
specialist in the construction of turnkey luxury hotel complexes. The
company continued construction work on up-market hotel complexes
on Laguna del Este on Cayo Santa Maria, on Cayo Coco and at Varadero.
It took orders for five hotels, including three 5-star hotels, at Havana, on
Cayo Santa Maria and, for the first time, on Cayo Cruz. The number of
tourists visiting the island has soared, opening up great prospects for the
Cuban hotel industry.

In the United States, Bouygues Construction continued work on the
Brickell City Centre development in Miami, a complex comprising offices,
shops, apartments and hotels.

In Canada, the company handed over a set of sporting facilities in
Ontario for the 2015 Pan American Games and continued work on Iqaluit
International Airport in the country’s Arctic north.

The company also has a presence in Latin America (particularly in
Mexico, Brazil and Peru) via its construction and specialised civil works
subsidiaries.

ENERGIES AND SERVICES

Bouygues Energies & Services contributed €2,118 million to
Bouygues Construction’s consolidated sales, 26% more than in 2014
(€1,677 million). Bouygues Energies & Services has three business lines:
network infrastructure, facilities management, and electrical and HVAC
engineering.

Environmental issues, demographic growth, spreading urbanisation and
increasingly scarce raw materials mean that building energy performance
is a central concern. Fast-growing telecommunications needs have also
increased demand for network infrastructure. These two key trends on
the energy and services markets offer Bouygues Construction sources of
growth, both in the countries where it has most of its operations (France,

36  BOUYGUES | 2015 Registration Document

the UK, Switzerland and Canada) and in emerging countries, especially
in Asia and Africa.

In France, many large firms operate on the market and competition is
fierce. Short-term economic uncertainties remain due to pressure on
central and local government budgets, affecting network infrastructure
works in particular, and to the difficulty of raising private finance, especially
for commercial property projects and public-private partnerships.

France

2015 sales: €1,076 million (+1%)

Bouygues Energies & Services, through its network infrastructure
subsidiary, helps local authorities to implement their digital development
policies. In the context of a public service mission, it rolls out and manages
digital infrastructure, operating in 26 French departments, managing
1,200,000 FTTH (fibre-to-the-home) connections and providing broadband
services to 6,500 municipalities serving 7 million people and 2,500 very-
high-speed broadband zones. In particular, it continued to roll out and
manage very-high-speed broadband networks in three departments, the
Oise (north of Paris), Eure-et-Loir (western France) and Vaucluse (southern
France), and started to roll out a network in the Aisne department in
north-eastern France.

Bouygues Energies & Services continued the street lighting contracts
begun in 2011, especially the major energy performance contract with
the City of Paris that aims to achieve a 30% reduction in the city’s energy
consumption by 2020 in comparison with the level in 2004. It continued a
20-year street lighting contract in Valenciennes (northern France) begun
in 2012 and took an order to renovate street lighting in Drancy, north-
east of Paris.

In electrical and HVAC engineering, Bouygues Energies & Services
continued work on a thermal power plant in the French part of the
Caribbean island of Saint-Martin and provided mechanical and electrical
equipment for the L2 Marseille bypass. It also took an order for electrical
and HVAC engineering packages for the Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni hospital
in French Guiana.

In partnership with Bouygues Construction’s building subsidiaries,
Bouygues Energies & Services’ FM subsidiary is involved in a number of
PPP contracts. It started maintenance contracts involving the new French
Defence Ministry, several highway maintenance centres, five secondary
schools in the Loiret department of central France and the University
of Burgundy. It will also operate the Paris law courts complex and the
University of Bordeaux.

International

2015 sales: €1,042 million (+71%)

Bouygues Energies & Services is continuing to expand in its three
main lines of business (FM, energy and digital networks, and electrical,
HVAC and mechanical engineering) in Europe (especially the UK and
Switzerland), Africa (Gabon and Congo) and North America (Canada).

On international markets, Bouygues Energies & Services is an expert
in major turnkey power grid infrastructure projects. It started work on a
solar farm in the Philippines and continued to operate and maintain three
photovoltaic solar power plants in Thailand. Construction work began
on a thermal power station in Gibraltar. In the UK, the company took
orders for the construction of two biomass waste-to-energy gasification
plants, at Hoddesdon, north of London, and in Belfast (Northern Ireland).
It continued a number of FM contracts in Europe, including Crédit Suisse
offices in Switzerland and King’s College, London in the UK.

In Africa, Bouygues Energies & Services is involved in power transport
and distribution, mainly in lvory Coast, Congo and Gabon.

In Canada, Bouygues Energies & Services provides FM for Surrey Hospital
and the RCMP headquarters. It is expanding on the electrical engineering
market via its Plan Group subsidiary, which in 2015 delivered electrical
engineering and building automation packages for the Humber River

2.1.2.3

Despite a still-challenging economic environment in France,
Bouygues Construction enjoys good visibility, backed up by:

= orders at 31 December 2015 to be executed in 2016 worth €9.0 billion;

= sustained international activity, especially in places less affected
by the economic crisis, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada,
Switzerland, the UK and Australia, which are highly rated by the NGO
Transparency International;

= a long-term order book (beyond five years) worth €2.9 billion at
31 December 2015;

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
Construction businesses

Regional Hospital north of Toronto. In July 2015, Bouygues Energies &
Services took a majority stake in Gastier, a Canadian company specialising
in electrical and mechanical engineering.

FM contracts, both in France and elsewhere, guarantee Bouygues Energies
& Services recurring long-term income.

Bouygues Construction’s outlook for 2016

= a sound financial structure, with a net cash position of €3.3 billion;

= a lead in sustainable construction, to which the company devotes
much of its R&D budget.

In 2016, tight control over the execution of major projects, a selective
approach to orders, satisfaction of customers’ expectations and
synergies between entities will continue to be central priorities for
Bouygues Construction, together with preserving the health and safety
of employees and project partners. Bouygues Construction will also take
initiatives to promote ethical behaviour in all its subsidiaries.

2.1.3.1 Profile

Growth strategy

Drawing on its expertise in green property development,
Bouygues Immobilier is consolidating its position as an urban developer/
operator, basing its future growth on the following three strategic priorities.

INNOVATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Implementing a pioneering sustainable development strategy,
Bouygues Immobilier confirmed its leadership in this area in 2015.

= Energy savings: green property development is a strategic element of
Bouygues Immobilier’s innovation policy. In the commercial segment,
around 15 Green Office® positive-energy projects are under way,
notably in Lyon and Bordeaux, home to the future headquarters of the
Caisse d’Epargne Aquitaine Poitou-Charentes bank. In the residential
segment, after Vert Eden in Aix-en-Provence, L’Avance in Montreuil,
east of Paris, and Green Home in Nanterre, west of Paris, in 2015
Bouygues Immobilier continued work on L’Odyssée at Anglet in south-
west France, a 130-unit residential complex, one of whose positive-
energy buildings will be the first in France to be certified by Cerqual
under its experimental Bepos-Effinergie 2013 pilot scheme.

In 2015 Bouygues Immobilier also developed Passivhaus very low-
energy homes at Carquefou, a suburb of Nantes in western France,
starting works on the Tempo and Parc de Flore programmes in the
Fleuriaye district, and in the Les Lodges operation at Chanteloup-en-
Brie, east of Paris.

= Rehabilitation which respects existing property assets:
Bouygues Immobilier continued the green rehabilitation of commercial
buildings under the Rehagreen®? initiative with the Sanofi Campus Val
de Biévre project in Gentilly, inaugurated in June 2015 and awarded
the COP21 “Climate Solutions” award at a ceremony at Le Bourget in
December 2015, Lemnys-Peri XV (AG2R La Mondiale), Scor in Paris,
and La Frangaise REM in Montrouge, south of Paris.

At neighbourhood level, Bouygues Immobilier offers local authorities
UrbanEra®, an innovative service package for the design and
development of mixed-use sustainable neighbourhoods combining
residential properties, offices and shops. Within the UrbanEra® framework
Bouygues Immobilier inaugurated Hikari, the first positive-energy property
development in France, in September 2015. The 12,500-m’ complex
comprises 36 apartments as well as offices and ground-floor shops and
services. In November 2015, Bouygues Immobilier was appointed lead
firm of the consortium (including Cirmad®, a Bouygues Construction
subsidiary) chosen to build a 200,000-m’ mixed-use eco-neighbourhood
comprising apartments, offices, shops and services, designated “XXL”,
in the heart of the Littorale mixed-use development zone in Marseille.

TECHNICAL AND ARCHITECTURAL QUALITY: A KEY PRIORITY

Using cutting-edge materials and technologies to improve the technical
quality of its buildings is an ongoing concern for Bouygues Immobilier. A
comprehensive quality management system incorporating ISO 9001 and
NF® Habitat certification coupled with a training programme for technical
staff ensure that the company can rapidly adapt to changing markets and
optimise the cost of works.

Bouygues Immobilier also teams up with leading names in contemporary
architecture. Wilmotte & Associés designed the future SMA headquarters
in Paris and Green Office® Rueil in Rueil-Malmaison, architects Anthony
Béchu and Tom Sheehan designed the Tour D? tower in La Défense
and Christian de Portzamparc, winner of the Pritzker prize in 1994, is
responsible for Colas’ future headquarters in Issy-les-Moulineaux.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

Customer satisfaction is at the heart of Bouygues Immobilier’s concerns.
In response to that priority, a new version of the residential property
sales website went online in November, offering prospective customers
an immersive experience through an enhanced search engine and a 3D
viewing feature.

In June 2015, Bouygues Immobilier started to market Flexom, a home
customisation package designed to suit all lifestyles and evolve in line with
occupants’ needs. With Flexom, Bouygues Immobilier became the first
property developer to offer connected homes to customers nationwide
(for more information see section 2.1.3.2)

Assets and opportunities

Its position and product range give Bouygues Immobilier a definite edge
in an unfavourable market environment.

= Extensive geographical coverage: 35 branches in France keep the
company close to customers and strengthen ties with local stakeholders;

= International expansion: Bouygues Immobilier already has operations

Market position

With a market share of 11%*, Bouygues Immobilier is France’s leading
residential property developer on a par with Nexity, and ahead of its other
main rivals, such as Icade, Cogedim and Kaufman & Broad. A benchmark
player in the commercial property segment, Bouygues Immobilier
differentiates itself from its main competitors (Icade, Nexity, Sogeprom
and BNP Immobilier) by proposing products which keep pace with new
working practices (Nextdoor) and are at the cutting edge of environmental
innovation (Green Office® and Rehagreen®»). At neighbourhood level,
Bouygues Immobilier has confirmed its leading position in sustainable
urban development with its UrbanEra® initiative.

2.1.3.2 Business activity in 2015

In a market that picked up significantly, Bouygues Immobilier took 12,195
residential property reservations in 2015, 4% more than in 2014, worth
€1,963 million, up 4% on 2014. In the commercial property segment, in
a stable market, reservations came to €487 million.

Total reservations (residential and commercial) were worth €2,450 million,
down 2% on 2014.

The order book stood at €2.6 billion at end-December 2015, up 9% year-
on-year.

Consolidated sales in 2015 amounted to €2,304 million, down 17% on
the previous year. The decline was expected, since it reflects lower levels
of residential property reservations between 2012 and 2014. Residential
property sales amounted to €1,989 million, down 6% on 2014. Commercial
property sales fell slightly, down 52% on 2014 to €315 million.

Current operating profit amounted to €138 million, representing 6.0% of
sales compared with 6.3% in 2014, and continued to reflect pressure on
the prices of residential programmes.

As a result of the figures above, net profit attributable to the Group
amounted to €77 million, lower than in 2014, as expected.

The number of completed but unsold units at end-2015 remained small,
representing about one week of marketing.

Shareholders’ equity at end-December 2015 stood at €479 million.

Bouygues Immobilier had net cash of €5 million at 31 December 2015,
showing tight control over its working capital requirement.

Developments in Bouygues Immobilier’s markets
and activities

RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY

A rise in reservations in a sharply recovering market

After declining in 2014, the French residential property market recovered
in 2015, with 102,538 housing units sold compared with 86,952 in 2014.

(a) Source: ECLN (new housing survey) - Data from developers (February 2016).

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
Construction businesses

There were various factors behind this recovery:

= attractive government measures to stimulate investment in buy-to-
let properties. The Pinel incentive offers tax reductions of up to 21%
for a 12-year rental period and offers the possibility of renting to an
ascendant or descendant;

= continuing very low mortgage interest rates.

In this favourable environment, Bouygues Immobilier saw an overall
increase in reservations in France that was lower than the pace of market
growth, mainly due to completion of the block sales contract to build
housing for EDF employees concluded with SNI in 2012. In contrast, unit
sales were up 13% at 7,222 units, in line with the market.

In 2015, 11,800 residential properties were handed over, which was 3%
more than the 11,492 handed over in 2014.

Creating value for customers

In a recovering market, Bouygues Immobilier consolidated its mainly
entry- to mid-level positioning in order to meet most buyers’ needs
for affordable housing. Because of the variety of its customer profiles,
Bouygues Immobilier is diversifying its property offering by marketing
several types of multi-unit housing (for first-time buyers or buy-to-let
investors, at below market prices, as well as intermediate housing),
single-family houses and serviced residences for senior citizens and
students. A dozen new projects for residences were launched following
the conclusion of a strategic partnership with Les Jardins d’Arcadie in
November 2014, including Les Jardins de Saint-Nicolas, a residence with
97 apartments and 700 m’ of communal space, work on which began in
Nancy in July 2015.

A significant effort to optimise design costs and purchasing, begun in
2013, started to bear fruit in 2015. The project enables the company to
price its products competitively and protect profitability while improving
the quality of residential properties.

Innovation in housing for the benefit of customers

In 2015, Bouygues Immobilier launched Flexom, a package that combines
customisation, innovation and home automation to provide a pleasant
living environment and optimal comfort. Adaptable to all lifestyles and to
occupants’ changing uses, Flexom offers a single technical platform plus
packs of options which customers can access on reservation or when
they choose their interior design and layout. Four thematic packs (Facilité,
Tranquillité, Famille, Senior) designed to meet residents’ expectations
include innovative services such as programmable remote control of roller
blinds, lighting and heating, a burglar alarm, a digital door lock and a water
and gas leak detector. All the residential properties offered for sale by
Bouygues Immobilier will be equipped with Flexom by the end of 2016.

Bouygues Immobilier continued its environmental policy in 2015, offering
positive- or passive-energy programmes. At Carquefou, north of Nantes,
a ceremony was held in September for the laying of the foundation stone
of Tempo and Le Parc de Flore, two residences designed by Magnum, a
local architecture and planning firm. By meeting requirements relating to
construction methods, sustainable materials, optimum use of natural light
and healthy ventilation, all the units are aiming for Passivhaus certification.

(b) A Bouygues Immobilier service which consists in identifying and implementing a rehabilitation scenario which combines the owner’s property enhancement objectives and
the requirements of the commercial property market while respecting the architectural heritage of the property assets concerned.

Solar panels on the 6,000 m? of roof will generate enough power to meet
80% of the neighbourhood’s electricity needs.

Strengthened customer support

After introducing online customer profiles in 2013 and innovative digital
sales tools in 2014 (Oculus and Google Cardboard glasses), in 2015
Bouygues Immobilier concluded a nationwide partnership agreement
with home loan broker La Centrale de Financement. Since March 2015,
customers reserving a Bouygues Immobilier property have been able
to consult the company to find the best conditions for a mortgage. In a
context where service and the best financial terms are key factors, the
partnership makes it easier for customers to buy a property and get a
foot on the housing ladder.

Bouygues Immobilier is going further in digitising its customer support
at all stages of the project lifecycle. Before reservation, since end-
November 2015 the bouygues-immobilier.com website has offered
potential customers a new, customisable and more modern look and
feel. Bouygues Immobilier also invites customers to play an active part in
some programmes. In Tourcoing, for example, the company has teamed
up with the crowdsourcing website Ouiville to enable customers to choose
the name of their residence, the type of vegetation to be planted and the
layout and landscaping of grounds.

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY

Green property: a winning strategy

Despite unfavourable economic conditions, take-up rates in the
commercial property market in the Paris region stabilised in 2015 after
declining for several years, with rents stabilising at a low level. In contrast,
investment remained stable at a high level.

In these conditions, Bouygues Immobilier sold 101,628 m? of office and
retail space in France in 2015, worth a total of €487 million.

Bouygues Immobilier’s commercial property strategy in 2015 focused on
the following three priorities:

Rollout of the Green Office’ and Rehagreen’ concepts

In March 2015, Bouygues Immobilier inaugurated Green Office® Rueil,
home to the headquarters of Unilever France, Ingérop and Amex Voyages
France. The complex, with total floor area of 35,000 m? on six storeys
and three underground levels, will produce more energy than it consumes
through a geothermal system and 4,000 m? of rooftop solar panels,
enough to offset the energy consumption of 130 households? a year.
Green Office® Rueil is also the first office building in France to obtain
NF HQE™ Batiments Tertiaires-Neuf/Label HPE certification at the
Bepos-Effinergie level for the construction phase. Other Green Office®
highlights in 2015 included the laying of the foundation stone of the
headquarters of the Caisse d’Epargne Aquitaine Poitou-Charentes bank
in Bordeaux and the sale unlet to Macifimo of Green Office® Link in Lyon.

Under the Rehagreen® initiative to enhance the value of existing property
assets, in June 2015 Bouygues Immobilier inaugurated the Campus
Sanofi Val de Biévre in Gentilly. Comprising three 3- to 6-storey terraced
buildings with total floor area of 51,000 m?, Campus Sanofi Val de
Biévre accommodates 3,000 employees and is connected to Gentilly’s
geothermal network. It incorporates a photovoltaic power plant, thermal

solar panels and a rainwater recovery system used to water the garden and
the plants on the terraces. Designed by architects Valode & Pistre, it has
been awarded HQE™ (High Environmental Quality) Passeport Exceptionnel
certification and is aiming for BREEAM® Very Good certification. It also won
the 2015 Grand Prix Simi award in the “New buildings of over 5,000 m2”
category at Simi - the annual French commercial property trade fair.

Successful turnkey projects

The outcome of ongoing dialogue with users, the turnkey strategy aims to
design projects tailored to specific customers. Major achievements in 2015
included the sale to Predica of PSA Peugeot Citroén’s future headquarters
at Rueil-Malmaison and the laying of the foundation stone of SMA’s future
headquarters in Paris. Designed by Wilmotte & Associés, the 35,000-m?
building will accommodate SMA’s headquarters staff and feature a 400-
seat multi-purpose auditorium, a fitness room, a 350-space car park and
a number of canteens. The project, which also includes a 149-room hotel,
is aiming for HQE™ (High Environmental Quality) Passeport Exceptionnel,
BREEAM®? International New Construction (Very Good) and LEED®* for
New Construction (Gold) certification.

Launch of Nextdoor: a low-carbon response to new ways

of working

In response to the increase in working on the move and transport-related
constraints, in March 2015 Bouygues Immobilier launched Nextdoor.
New-generation methods have been used to design these economical,
flexible and collaborative work spaces; optimised and comfortable, they
encourage networking, creativity and performance. They enable small
firms and start-ups to grow their business while creating a useful network,
and large firms to offer their employees a different and stimulating working
environment closer to home. The first Nextdoor site (2,600 m?), designed
by Yad Initiative, opened at Issy-les-Moulineaux in June 2015 and boasted
an occupancy rate of nearly 100% at the end of the year.

SUSTAINABLE URBAN DEVELOPMENT

Aware of the many demographic, environmental, economic and social
challenges facing local authorities in relation to urban development,
Bouygues Immobilier stepped up its strategy in 2015 by creating a specific
UrbanEra® division that sets practical and measurable targets, adapted to
local circumstances, for the development of sustainable neighbourhoods.
This innovative approach is based on six priority areas of action: energy
and utilities, urban services and mobility, water and waste, biodiversity
and nature in the city, buildings and comfort of use, and consultation. A
number of UrbanEra® projects, such as Hikari in Lyon, were successfully
completed in 2015.

Fort d’lssy: off to a good start

Two years after handing over the Fort d’lssy eco-neighbourhood, the
municipality of Issy-les-Moulineaux and Bouygues Immobilier carried
out a survey? to measure the satisfaction of residents, retailers and local
people. 95% of residents said they were proud to live in Fort d’lssy, 8 out
of 9 retailers were happy with their level of business and 81% of local
people said they often came to Fort d’lssy.

Hikari: inauguration of the first positive-energy mixed-use
development in France

Comprising three mixed-use buildings including apartments, offices and
shops, Hikari (which means “light” in Japanese) was designed by the

architect Kengo Kuma and is the outcome of an exemplary public-private
partnership involving the Lyon metropolitan authority, Japan’s Nedo
(department of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development
Organisation), Bouygues Immobilier/SCL Pitance, Toshiba and many other
French and Japanese partners. Each year, the 12,800-m’ development will
produce more energy than it consumes, thanks to bioclimatic architecture,
an on-site plant-oil cogeneration plant and photovoltaic power plant, and
pooled energy management. Hikari was singled out for a Climate Solutions
award at the COP21 climate conference in Paris in December 2015 in the
“Adaptation” category.

XXL: the eco-neighbourhood of the future

In November 2015, the consortium comprising Bouygues Immobilier
and Cirmad*, a Bouygues Construction subsidiary, won the call for
expressions of interest to build an eco-neighbourhood in the Littorale
mixed development zone north of Marseille. Comprising 2,800 apartments,
60,000 m’ of office space and 10,000 m’ of retail space, the 200,000-m’
eco-neighbourhood, provisionally called “XXL”, will be a real incubator
of social and economic innovation.

Industrial demonstrators for the sustainable city:

two innovative mixed-use projects

Within the framework of the Institut de la Ville Durable (\Institute for
Sustainable Cities), the French Ministries of Ecology, Sustainable
Development and Energy, and Housing, Territorial Equality and Rural
Affairs have launched a call for projects under the title “Industrial
Demonstrators for the Sustainable City”. The initiative represents an
opportunity for Bouygues Immobilier to showcase its cross-cutting and
collaborative approach to urban planning.

Teaming up with Bouygues Construction in the UrbanEra?® initiative,
Bouygues Immobilier was chosen for two demonstrators. One, in Lyon,
is for an innovative mixed-use project of over 100,000 m’ with the Lyon
Confluence development authority and the Lyon metropolitan authority
in a consortium with over 70 public- and private-sector partners. In
the second, located in Champs-sur-Marne, to the east of Paris,
Bouygues Immobilier and Bouygues Construction will together develop

2.1.3.3

In a residential property market which has improved significantly,
Bouygues Immobilier intends to consolidate its position as an urban
developer/operator in 2016 and to pursue growth in France and elsewhere.
The company will draw on the drivers that have underpinned its success to
date: innovation and sustainable development, technical and architectural
quality, and listening to and supporting customers.

= Residential: innovation will be used to benefit customers by offering
them a more personalised, connected, modular and sustainable living
environment. The company will continue to strive to provide affordable,
high-quality homes by diversifying the range of properties and products
(intermediate housing, managed residences, etc.) and optimising
design.

= Commercial: 2016 will be the year of Nextdoor, with the scheduled
opening of four or five new sites in France. Bouygues Immobilier aims to

a 100,000-m’ complex around the Noisy-Champs RER railway station, with
a consortium of industrial firms including Embix, Idex, RATP, Capgemini
and GE Grid Solutions. Amongst other things, the partners aim to develop
anew model for energy management within a housing complex in order
to reduce the carbon footprint.

INTERNATIONAL

In 2015, for the first time, Bouygues Immobilier took more than 1,000
reservations outside France. Business was particularly strong in two
countries.

Poland

Bouygues Immobilier consolidated its activity in Warsaw and opened a
new branch in Wroclaw.

Morocco

In 2015, Bouygues Immobilier started work on the first two phases (out
of three) of Les Faubourgs d’Anfa in Casablanca, comprising 13,498 m*
of office space and 450 apartments. The site, developed by Auda, a
Moroccan subsidiary of Caisse des Dépéts et Consignations, will host
Casablanca’s future financial centre.

OPEN INNOVATION: MAKING THE COMPANY MORE AGILE

In 2015, Bouygues Immobilier created a specific subsidiary to invest
in start-ups specialising in property development. Wholly-owned by
Bouygues Immobilier, Bird (Bouygues Immobilier R&D) takes minority
stakes (10-15%) in innovative companies involved in strategic activities
for Bouygues Immobilier in the residential, commercial and retail property,
planning and urban services segments.

Through a non-exclusive partnership, Bird will help such firms to grow
while retaining their operational and commercial independence. Several
investments had been made in various start-ups at 31 December
2015, including REALIZ3D (3D modelling), Lymo (the leader in property
crowdfunding in France) and BePark (operator of car parks using
innovative smart technology).

Bouygues Immobilier’s outlook for 2016

test a new model for large firms, incorporating the Nextdoor approach
into the design of corporate headquarters.

= Urban planning: the innovative UrbanEra® concept, which has already
proved a success in Bordeaux (Ginko), Lyon Confluence (Hikari)
and Nanterre (Coeur de Quartier), is Bouygues Immobilier’s driver of
growth in the development of sustainable neighbourhoods in France
and abroad, offering residents an urban model and services that are
innovative and eco-friendly.

= International: the company will continue its strategic expansion on
international markets from its existing subsidiaries in Poland, Belgium
and Morocco. A move into a new country should take place in 2016.

Bouygues Immobilier will implement these strategies while maintaining
its current robust financial structure.

2.1.41 Profile

With 800 profit centres and 2,000 materials production units in over
50 countries around the world, Colas is a leader in transport infrastructure
construction and maintenance and spans the full range of production
and recycling activities associated with most of its lines of business. The
group completes more than 80,000 projects each year and much of its
core business is of a recurrent nature.

With nearly 57,000 employees, Colas reported sales of €12 billion in
2015, of which France accounted for 51%, Europe (excl. France) for 18%,
North America for 22% and other countries for 9%.

Colas operates in all areas of transport infrastructure construction and
maintenance through two main operating divisions: roads, its core
business, and complementary specialised activities.

Activities

ROADS (81% OF SALES)

The roads business comprises two activities: road infrastructure
construction and maintenance, and the production and sale of construction
materials.

Road infrastructure construction and maintenance

(66% of sales)

Each year, Colas completes around 60,000 projects worldwide involving
the construction and/or maintenance of roads and motorways, airport
runways, ports, industrial, logistics and commercial hubs, urban roads
and amenities, reserved-lane public transport (bus lanes and tramways),
recreational facilities and environmental projects. Alongside the highly
seasonal roads activity (though the seasonal influence is more marked
in some countries than others), Colas has a civil engineering activity
spanning both small and large projects, and a marginal building activity
in some regions.

Colas’ business covers many small-scale contracts as well as major
projects that may involve complex contractual structures such as
concessions, PPP (public-private partnership), PFI (private finance
initiative) or MAC/ASC (Managing Agent Contractor/Asset Support
Contract). In that context, Colas sometimes takes interests, generally
minority shareholdings, in companies that hold motorway, urban road or
urban public transport concessions.

Production and sale of construction materials (15% of sales)

Upstream of roadbuilding, Colas produces and recycles construction
materials through an extensive international network of 714 quarries
and gravel pits, 129 emulsion and binder plants, 553 asphalt plants,
197 ready-mix concrete plants and two bitumen production plants (of which
the Dunkirk site that will be discontinued or sold at the start of 2016).
In 2015, Colas produced 95 million tonnes of aggregates, 1.8 million tonnes

(a) This figure corresponds to the bitumen output of the Kemaman plant in Malaysia.

of emulsions and binders, 39 million tonnes of asphalt mix, 2.4 million m?
of ready-mix concrete and one million tonnes of bitumen?. The world’s
leading producer of emulsions and asphalt mixes, Colas can also count on
authorised reserves? of 2.6 billion tonnes of aggregates (31 years’ output),
plus additional potential reserves° of 2.1 billion tonnes.

SPECIALISED ACTIVITIES (19% OF SALES)
Colas has five specialised activities:

Railways (8% of sales)

The railways activity (Colas Rail) comprises the design and engineering
of complex, large-scale projects and the construction, renewal and
maintenance of rail networks (conventional and high-speed lines, trams
and metro systems), covering both installations and infrastructure,
including track laying and maintenance, electrification, safety and
signalling systems, specific works, the manufacture of sleepers and a
rail freight business. Colas Rail operates in France and abroad, mostly
in the UK, but also in other countries in Europe, Asia, North Africa and
South America.

Waterproofing (5% of sales)

Waterproofing (Smac) comprises the production and sale of waterproofing
membranes, both in France and on international markets, and, mainly
in France, the waterproofing of buildings, engineering structures and
car parks, the cladding and roofing of buildings, where Smac has
acknowledged expertise in projects requiring high-level technical skills,
and asphalt-based road- and groundworks.

Road safety and signalling (3% of sales)

The road safety and signalling business is operated through Aximum,
mainly in France, and consists in the manufacture, installation and
maintenance of road safety equipment (safety barriers and traffic control
equipment), road marking (production of road paint and road marking
work), road signs, signals, traffic management and access control
equipment (traffic lights and equipment for toll, parking lot and access
control barriers).

Networks (2% of sales)

The networks business (Spac), which mainly operates in France,
encompasses the installation and maintenance of large- and small-
diameter pipes and pipelines for conveying fluids (oil, gas and water),
including the turnkey construction of gas compression stations, and for
dry networks (electricity, heating and telecommunications).

Production and sales of refined products in France

(1% of sales)

The production of base oils by the Société de la Raffinerie de Dunkerque
(SRD) production unit was definitively discontinued in April 2015, and the
bitumen production and sales activity will either be discontinued or sold
at the beginning of 2016.

(b) Authorised reserves correspond to the annual tonnages authorised by the government multiplied by the number of years remaining before the operating licence expires, for
all the sites under the group’s control. An upper limit is set on this figure according to the economically viable quantities (in number of tonnes) within the scope of the licence.

(c) Potential reserves correspond to existing tonnages not already counted as authorised reserves on sites under the group’s control for which there is a reasonable likelihood
of obtaining a licence. The figure is limited to 50 years’ output on the assumption that a licence will be granted or an existing licence renewed.

Growth strategies and opportunities

Colas’ strategy of profitable growth and responsible development is based
on the following priorities:

= strengthening and extending a durable network of profit centres
around the world, mainly by external growth, in order to establish and
consolidate leading positions on local markets and take advantage
of a degree of geographical diversification that helps to spread risk;

controlling supplies of the materials and resources it needs for its
activities, through optimised industrial integration designed to increase
security and quality of supply, generate more value-added and improve
competitiveness;

continuing to develop existing specialised activities, which often
enhance the range of products and services offered to customers, help
to develop synergies and gain a foothold in new regions and markets,
and enable the company to position itself on growing markets, such
as railways;

offering extended and innovative services by continuing to develop
complex projects (PPPs, concessions, network management) that
integrate all the company’s technical, financial and legal skills, as well
as building major projects that are complementary to its traditional
core business;

innovating, especially by designing new products and developing
new technologies, through a research and development policy which
seeks to keep pace with customers’ expectations in areas such as
quality, comfort, safety, protection of the environment and cost, and
to design the road of the future;

= favouring profitability over volume, with the objective of constantly
improving margins across all businesses.

Strengths and assets
Colas’ main strengths are:

= positions on long-term growth markets, given the substantial needs
for transport infrastructure worldwide, underpinned by structural
factors such as population growth, urbanisation, increased global
trade, lack of infrastructure in emerging countries, renewal of existing
infrastructure in developed countries, mobility and environmental
challenges. Colas’ core business mix includes a substantial proportion
of upkeep and maintenance activities that meet recurring needs and
generate a large number of projects, helping to spread risk;

vertical integration upstream of the production chain and a policy of
controlling the supplies of materials required by its activities (aggregates,
binders, asphalt mixes, ready-mix concrete and bitumen) that contribute
to the group’s operating performance;

a network of 800 profit centres and 2,000 materials production
units in over 50 countries around the world, some of them dating back
over a hundred years. The density of this network is an advantage in

Construction businesses

businesses where maintaining a local presence and keeping close to
customers are key success factors;

= a decentralised organisation with strong local roots that is flexible,
responsive and adapted to market needs. Having a limited number of
levels of management means that decisions can be taken at the most
appropriate and effective level. Its organisational structure enables the
group to react flexibly in operational terms and to adapt to changing
market conditions;

= human capital that creates collective intelligence, with values
and a passion shaped by a long common history shared by nearly
57,000 employees;

= an innovation policy, especially in technical areas, supported by a
2,000-strong international network comprising a Campus for Science
and Techniques (CST), which is the road industry’s leading private R&D
centre, some 50 laboratories and 100 engineering consultancies. 2015
was marked by the launch of Wattway, the world’s first photovoltaic road
surface, in partnership with Ines (France’s National Solar Technology
Institute);

= acknowledged technical, legal and financial skills in the execution
of complex projects. Capable of offering end-to-end services
wherever it operates, including the design, construction, engineering
and maintenance of major transport infrastructure projects, Colas
has achieved a number of major commercial successes and is able
to grasp the opportunities associated with complex types of project
(concessions, PPP, PFI, MAC/ASC, etc.) that offer an optimised
response to customers’ needs;

= a capacity to expand through both external and organic growth;

= a robust financial structure and a capacity to generate cash flow
which, as well as being advantages in tendering for certain projects,
enable the Colas group to pursue further growth by continuing to invest
in targeted assets.

Market position

Colas is the leader on the roads market in mainland France ahead of
Eurovia (Vinci) and Eiffage Infrastructures. It is also in competition with
large regional firms (Ramery, Charrier, Pigeon, NGE) and an extensive
network of small and medium-sized regional and local firms. Cement
makers are competitors on the markets for aggregates and ready-mix
concrete. In North America, Colas competes with local, regional and
national firms as well as subsidiaries of multinationals. Colas has prime
positions in the roadbuilding sector in most of the other countries where
it operates, its main competitors being national firms or subsidiaries of
large international firms.

In its specialised activities, Colas’ main competitors in France are Soprema
in the waterproofing sector, and ETF (Eurovia), TSO (NGE), TGS (Alstom),
and Eiffage Rail in the railways sector.

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
Construction businesses

2.1.4.2 Business activity in 2015

Colas group’s sales in 2015 amounted to €11,960 million, down 4% on
the previous year, in a still-morose French market and a wider context of
weak economic growth, or even recession in some regions where Colas
has operations. Sales fell 8% in France but rose 2% on international
markets. Like-for-like and at constant exchange rates, sales were down
4% on 2014.

Sales in the roads activity fell 2% as growth on international and French
overseas markets was not sufficient to entirely offset the decline in
mainland France. Sales in specialised activities (excluding the production
and sale of refined products) increased 4%, driven by a further rise in the
railways activity.

Current operating profit amounted to €344 million, compared with
€332 million in 2014, and the current operating margin stood at 2.9%,
compared with 2.7% in 2014. Good performances by the railways activity
and nearly all roads subsidiaries on international and French overseas
markets, especially in North America, Europe, Asia and French overseas
departments, offset a substantial loss on the production and sale of
refined products (€77 million) and a controlled decline in the contribution
to operating profit of the roads activity in mainland France.

Stripping out the impact of the production and sale of refined products,
the current operating margin would be 3.6%.

Non-current charges of €95 million before tax were booked during the
period, mainly to take account of the consequences of the decision to
discontinue the production and sale of refined oil products.

The contribution of joint ventures and associates was no longer boosted
by the €385-million capital gain on the sale of the stake in Cofiroute in
early 2014. The contribution amounted to €78 million in 2015, substantially
more than in 2014 (excluding the capital gain on the sale of the stake
in Cofiroute), thanks to an excellent performance by Tasco, the Thai
subsidiary in which Colas has a 32% stake, which had an exceptionally
good year.

Net profit attributable to the Group amounted to €234 million, compared
with €604 million in 2014, a figure which included a €385-million capital
gain on the sale of the stake in Cofiroute.

Net capital expenditure amounted to €311 million in 2015, compared with
€456 million in 2014, a year in which substantial investments were made.

Colas continued to examine opportunities for acquisitions in 2015, but
external growth during the year was modest. Only a small number of
acquisitions were made, with a view to strengthening existing operations.
The net cost of acquisitions amounted to €10 million, compared with
€42 million in 2014 (excluding the sale of the stake in Cofiroute).

The financial structure remained robust, with a high level of shareholders’
equity (€2.7 billion) and a net cash position of €560 million at the end of

48 BOUYGUES | 2015 Registration Document

the year, compared with €682 million at end-December 2014, a figure
boosted by the proceeds of the sale of the stake in Cofiroute.

Roads (2015 sales: €9,717 million)

Sales were 2% lower than in 2014 (6% lower like-for-like and at constant
exchange rates).

ROADS MAINLAND FRANCE (2015 SALES: €3,982 MILLION)

Sales in 2015 fell by 11% in comparison with 2014, when they were
already 13% down on the previous year. Although the decline needs to
be weighted for the impact of the falling price of oil products, especially
bitumen, which can be estimated at 4%, the roads market contracted
again in 2015 as central government grants to local authorities continued
to diminish. This was compounded by the usual slowdown at election
time (elections were held for departmental councils in March and regional
councils in December), and by the uncertainties generated by local
government reform. The decline in activity hit all regions and turned out
to be greater than expected. After falling for several years, the roads
activity has returned to the same level as ten years ago. However, roads
subsidiaries were able to cushion some of the impact of the fall on their
operating profit by taking extensive measures to adjust to the changed
situation.

Colas was involved in two ongoing large-scale projects: construction of
the Nimes-Montpellier high-speed railway bypass and the L2 Marseille
bypass. The PPP Vichy bypass project was handed over at the end of
December 2015. It benefits from a 15-year maintenance contract. Work
on the Troissereux bypass in the Oise department north-west of Paris,
which is also PPP, continued under good conditions.

ROADS EUROPE (2015 SALES: €1,674 MILLION)

Sales were close to the level in 2014 (up 1% but down 3.5% like-for-like
and at constant exchange rates).

Sales in Northern Europe were very similar to the level in 2014 (up 1%).
They were stable in the UK, sustained by multi-annual road and motorway
maintenance contracts and the Transport for London contract, and in
Ireland. Sales picked up in Denmark but fell back in Switzerland and
Belgium.

Sales in Central Europe remained at the same level as in 2014, after
strong growth driven by work on major motorway projects awarded in late
2013, helped by a mild winter, which meant that activity could continue
until mid-December. In Hungary, work on sections of the M85 and M86
motorways neared completion and the Budapest tramway extension was
handed over, but work on the M4 motorway was halted at the customer’s
request because European funding had been withheld. In Slovakia, the
major R2 expressway project neared completion. In the Czech Republic,
two sections of the D1 motorway were handed over. Sales were stable in
Poland but Croatia and Slovenia were still in recession.
ROADS NORTH AMERICA (2015 SALES: €2,666 MILLION)

Sales rose 8% on 2014 but fell 3% like-for-like and at constant exchange
rates.

In the United States, sales rose 13%. The roads market was boosted
by the many infrastructure funding initiatives taken by certain states.
Initiatives to refocus on core businesses were concluded and almost all
the large-scale civil engineering projects that had run into difficulties had
been completed by the end of December 2015. Although the order book
was smaller, some major road and highway resurfacing contracts were
gained in the latter part of the year.

In Canada, sales remained stable (up 1%), sustained by activity in Ontario,
British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan and by favourable weather
throughout the country. The subsidiary in Quebec benefited from a two-
year effort to transform and reorganise the company and from the Iqaluit
International Airport PPP project in Nunavut.

ROADS “REST OF THE WORLD” (2015 SALES: €1,395 MILLION)

A3% rise in sales versus 2014 (1% like-for-like and at constant exchange
rates) reflected contrasting situations:

= Sales rose in French overseas departments. Activity fell back overall in
the Caribbean-French Guiana zone because of cuts in local government
funding. On Reunion Island, work on the New coastal road partly
offset a decline in traditional building and civil works activity. Activity
on Mayotte fell due to the lack of any large-scale projects;

= Sales in Morocco rose even though there were no major projects. An
overall increase in sales in West and Central Africa masked differences
from one country to another. Sales rose in Ivory Coast, work started
on the Tchetti-Savalou and Logozouhé-Glazoué roads in Benin, work
continued on the second northern exit road from Brazzaville in Congo,
but sales in Gabon declined as a result of the falling oil price. Sales
in Southern Africa, driven by the manufacture and sale of emulsions,
fell back in a shrinking market. Sales also fell in Madagascar, where
there has been a lack of new work to take up the slack from completed
projects, and in Mauritius in the absence of major contracts;

Sales rose in Asia/Australia/New Caledonia. In Asia, activity
focuses on the production, distribution and sale of bitumen products
via a network comprising a bitumen production plant in Malaysia,
25 emulsion plants and 21 bitumen depots. Sales increased in this
region, driven by sustained demand: they rose sharply in Thailand,
increased in Vietnam and remained stable in India. The Indonesian
roadworks subsidiary Wasco was sold. In Australia, Colas consolidated
its businesses (roadworks and the sale of bitumen and emulsions) in
2015. The subsidiary in New Caledonia had a good year.

(a) Public-private partnership

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
Construction businesses

Specialised activities (2015 sales: €2,227 million)

Sales by specialised activities, excluding the production and sale of
refined products in France, amounted to €2,107 million, up 4%, with
trends differing from one activity to another:

= Sales in the Railways business rose 12% to €1,007 million, evenly
balanced between activities in mainland France and on international
markets (up 8% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates). In France,
the track renewal and maintenance activity held up well and rail works
started on the Nimes-Montpellier high-speed railway bypass, but there
were no new tramway projects in 2015. In the UK, where sales rose
again, a major contract was gained to upgrade the Wessex railway
network. Work on the Kelana Jaya light railway extension in Kuala
Lumpur (Malaysia) and construction of Line 2 of the Los Teques metro
in Venezuela and Lines 3 and 6 of the Santiago metro in Chile continued
in good conditions. Two contracts were gained for the extension of
Line 3 of the Cairo metro in Egypt.

m Sales were stable in:

Networks, with sales of €196 million, virtually the same as in 2014,
and a good level of activity in gas and oil transport (laying of pipelines)
and energy distribution (thermal energy and power lines);

Waterproofing, with sales of €594 million, down 2% on 2014, ina
still-tough building market in mainland France;

Road safety and signalling, with sales of €310 million, comparable
to 2014, in a tough market.

= The Production and sales of refined products activity generated sales
of €120 million versus €428 million in 2014. SRD halted the production
of base oils in April 2015. The bitumen production activity will be halted
or sold in early 2016.

Projects

Over 80,000 projects were completed or begun in 50 or so countries in
2015. The following examples illustrate the range and diversity of Colas’
operations and projects.

MAINLAND FRANCE

= Construction of the Nimes-Montpellier high-speed railway bypass, a

2.1.4.3 Colas’ outlook for 2016

The order book at end-December 2015 stood at €7 billion, a high level
albeit 2% lower than a year previously. The composition of the order
book reflects the trends seen over the last two years, since orders on
international and French overseas markets were 4% higher at €4.3 billion
while orders in mainland France were 11% lower at €2.7 billion.

In 2016, after falling sharply for two years, sales in the roads activity in
mainland France could again fall slightly and bottom out. A plan has been
launched to transform the organisation and operating methods with the
aim of improving operating profitability over a two-year period in a context
of long-term lower volumes of business. The international roads activity
and the railway activity should experience a good level of activity. Several
infrastructure spending plans should produce their initial positive effects
(UK, Canada and the US). The other Specialised activities (Networks,
Waterproofing, Signalling) could post stable activity.

Other than that, two major events will have an impact on the group’s
consolidation scope:

= at the beginning of 2016, Colas will sell its bitumen storage, transport
and sales subsidiaries in Vietnam, Singapore and Indonesia to its Thai

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
Construction businesses

subsidiary Tasco, in which it has a 32% stake, in order to boost overall
synergies. The effect will be to reduce Colas’ consolidated sales by
around €150 million, since only Tasco’s profits are consolidated as
“Share of profits of joint ventures and associates”.

m= the production and sale of refined products activity has been
discontinued. No sales are projected in 2016 (sales were €120 million
in 2015). This discontinuation will help to reduce the losses from this
activity significantly. Only the fixed costs of the Dunkirk unit (SRD) will
continue to be booked until the redundancy plan has been adopted.
Provisions or write-offs were booked at end-December 2015 to take
account of the other consequences of discontinuing the activity.

On the basis of these projections and available information, and excluding
external growth, sales in 2016 will probably be lower than in 2015, with
a target of a continued improvement in operating profitability. Colas
also intends to continue focusing on its strategic priorities, especially
the expansion of its international operations and growth in the railways
business, and has the necessary financial resources to fund such growth,
whether organic or through acquisitions.

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
TF, the leading private television group in France

2.21 Profile

TF1 is the leading private media group in freeview television in France. It
produces four complementary freeview TV channels — TF1, TMC, NT1 and
HD1 - that together claimed an average 27.7%? audience share in 2015.

The group as a whole is strengthening this leadership position by
continuously adapting to new content consumption behaviour. TF1 has
developed a powerful digital version of its television offering. It proposes
exclusive digital content and VOD offers to reach all viewer segments
across all platforms.

The group also produces pay-TV theme channels responding to the
specific expectations of TV viewers: LCI®, TV Breizh, Histoire, Ushuaia TV
and Serieclub.

Through this unique offering, TF1’s advertising sales teams bring
advertisers the possibility of combining the strong ratings of its television
channels with the advantages of personal digital media. They also sell
advertising space for metronews.fr, Les Indés Radios, a diverse range of
TV channels outside the TF1 group, and a number of websites.

The TF1 group produces and distributes content related to its own
broadcasting. The group has acquired a 70% stake in Newen, a major
audiovisual production and distribution company in France (see 2.2.1.3),
with a view to stepping up the roll-out of production and distribution
internationally.

The TF1 group has also created a broad range of complementary activities
in home shopping, licences, board games, music production and live
shows.

As a media group, TF1 is mindful of its responsibilities and committed
to high-quality dialogue with all its stakeholders, the aim being to ensure
transparency and continue improving the group’s practices.

2.2.1) Development strategy

and opportunities

With the advertising market failing to pick up in 2015, the group pursued
its strategy and the transformation of its business model:

Maintaining its leadership in freeview broadcasting

The group’s number-one strategic objective is to maintain its leadership
position in freeview television by continuing to enhance the competitive
positions of all its channels on all platforms. With the commitments
concerning TMC and NT1 taken with the French competition authority
having come to an end in 2015, the group is now able to take better
advantage of the complementary editorial and commercial fit of its four
freeview channels.

Seizing growth opportunities in order to develop

The TF1 group has identified two growth drivers that will serve to
strengthen its core business:

= Content production and distribution, by boosting the group’s
presence in the audiovisual rights market. In January 2016 the group
completed the acquisition® of a 70% stake in Newen, a leading player
in the sector in France, to step up the roll-out of production and
distribution internationally;

= Digital media, with a view to rolling out its expertise across a broader
scope of activities by keeping pace with changes in the sector, both
in consumption habits (second screens, non-linear content) and in
advertising sales and audience monetisation approaches.

In parallel to the implementation of this strategy, the TF1 group is
continuously monitoring trends in its cost base.

2.2.1.2 Strengths and assets

The global offering of the TF1 group gives it robust assets:

= a unique position in the French audiovisual sector through its four
complementary freeview channels, including TF1, a leading brand in
France;

= synergies between television and digital media extend the reach of
the brands broadcast on group channels;

= unique exposure opportunities for advertisers in their relationship
with TV viewers and web users over all platforms;

= recognised expertise in the production, distribution and editorial
treatment of audiovisual content;

= expertise in content, production and distribution in France and
abroad;

= a strong capacity to adapt and innovate;

= high-potential partnerships, notably with the main private European
broadcasters in the European Media Alliance ?;

= arobust financial structure that gives the group the means to finance
its growth and profitability ambitions.

2.2.1.3 Market position

Freeview TV

Ina French DTT market comprising 25 channels, the TF1 group proposes
in addition to the leading channel, TF1, a multi-channel offering with TMC,
NT1 and HD1. It competes with state-owned channels and private groups,

(a) Source: Médiamat by Médiamétrie, consolidated ratings at 31 December 2015. Audience: individuals aged 4 and over.
(b) Following the decision of the CSA (French broadcasting authority) in December 2015, LCI will join TF1’s freeview line-up in 2016.

(c) Following the obtaining of the regulatory approvals.

(d) An initiative of ProSiebenSat, this is a media network comprised of several leading European broadcasters whose aim is to boost geographic reach and investment opportunities

in the digital sphere.

54  BOUYGUES | 2015 Registration Document
including Métropole Télévision (M6, W9, 6Ter) and Canal+ group (Canal+,
D8, D17).

The group remains the most powerful private player, with an audience
share of 27.7% * at 31 December 2015 compared with 13.6% for its main
private-sector rival.

In the advertising market, the TF1 group also competes against the press,
radio, web, billboard and cinema media. Advertising spend is highest in
television. TF1 Publicité, the TF1 group’s advertising sales agency, has
extended its business activities to include the press, radio and web.

Furthermore, the TF1 group is confronted with the arrival of global web
players in the broadcasting sector. It is appealing to the authorities to
introduce fair competition rules.

Digital
The TF1 group has rolled out its MYTF1 digital brand across all media:
catch-up TV (IPTV) is used by an average 9 million unique visitors® a

month. On average, in 2015, the TF1 group ranked fifth in terms of the time
spent watching the on-line videos that it makes available to the public.

2.2.2 Business activity in 2015

In 2015, TF1 strengthened its position in freeview television, and obtained
LCl’s migration to free-to-air, despite a difficult economic and competitive
environment. It continued its digital transformation and positioned itself in
the production and distribution of audiovisual content with the acquisition
of Newen.

2.2.2.1 Changing behaviour in a still

fragmented sector

Television continues to appeal to advertisers, remaining by far the number-
one media in France in terms of advertising spend in 2015°. But the lack
of momentum in the French economy prevented a substantial increase
in value in the television advertising market, with net advertising spend
rising slightly in 2015°.

Competition remained fierce in the television market. Boosted by their
increased geographical coverage, the growing power of the six new HD
DTT channels launched in December 2012 weighed on the audience share
of some incumbent channels. The TF1 group confirmed its position as
the leading private television group in France in 2015. Its audience share
remains unrivalled, totalling 27.7% with individuals aged 4 and over?.
The TF1 TV channel continues to rank as the undisputed leader through
its powerful and event-driven programming, while the TF1 group’s DTT
channels made significant progress. LCI, the TF1 group’s rolling news
channel, will further extend the freeview offering in the first few months
of 2016.

(b) Médiamétrie/NetRatings (2015 average over IPTV).
(c) Kantar Media.

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
TF, the leading private television group in France

Furthermore, MYTF1VOD is the VOD platform with the widest distribution
in France.

The TF1 group boasts strong presence on social media, the aim being to
develop a unique relationship with its TV viewers.

Production and distribution

In 2015 the group also strengthened its position in the audiovisual content
production and distribution market by acquiring a 70% stake in Newen.
This acquisition was completed in January 2016. Newen delivered over
1,300 hours of programming in 2015, making it the number-one producer
of drama and the number-three producer of light entertainment shows
in France.

Pay-TV

In pay-TV, the TF1 group markets the theme channels Ushuaia TV, Histoire,
TV Breizh and Serieclub to operators.

To diversify its revenues, the TF1 group has established strong positions
in other markets, including broadcasting rights, home shopping, video
and music.

In other developments, technological advances and the resulting new uses
are accelerating the growth of non-linear TV content consumption, which
is increasingly multi-screen. That being so, the TF1 group continued to
develop its digital presence in 2015. The new version of its MYTF1 site
now groups the offering of the four freeview channels, rounded out by
XTRA, a 100% digital content channel. TF1 also shored up its position
in content by acquiring a 70% stake in the French production company
Newen in January 2016 following approval from the regulatory authorities.

By rolling out its strategy, TF1 strengthened its positions in its markets in
2015 and opened up new avenues of development for the coming years.

2.2.2.2 Key figures in 2015

Consolidated sales hold up well in 2015
(excluding non-recurring impacts)

The TF1 group posted consolidated sales of €2,004 million in 2015, down
€239 million on 2014. The decrease stemmed largely from scope effects
(with the deconsolidation of Eurosport France on 31 March 2015 and the
contribution of Eurosport International on 1 June 2014 following the sale
of the controlling interest to Discovery Communications on 30 May 2014,
together with the sale of OneCast and the discontinuation of the Stylia
channel in late 2014) and from a difference in the amount of sports rights
sales, with no impact on profitability.

BOUYGUES | 2015 Registration Document 55
BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
TF, the leading private television group in France

Excluding these effects, TF1 sales decreased slightly, by 0.5%.

Advertising sales for the TF1 group’s four channels were down slightly by
0.5% to €1,470 million. In an increasingly fragmented sector and in the
absence of a substantial recovery in the television advertising market, the
TF1 group harnessed its multi-channel strategy to offset the fall in sales
from its long-standing TF1 TV channel through an increase in sales from
the DTT channels.

It was a mixed year for TF1’s other advertising businesses. The
discontinuation of the print version of the Metronews freesheet weighed
on sales, while TF1’s positions in the digital sector considerably increased
advertising sales from new media, and advertising sales to third parties
were robust, with a rise in sales.

Sales of TF1’s content business rose slightly in 2015, by 0.5%, excluding
the impact of the sales of sports rights, which totalled €30 million in 2014
(2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™) compared with €13 million in 2015 (Rugby
World Cup).

The consumer services activity grew once again in 2015, with a 2.1%
increase in sales. TF1 Entreprises posted a record year with a 7.8% rise
in sales thanks to the success of its Board Games department, which is
responsible for Chrono Bomb - the best seller in France in 2015 — and
the Harry Potter exhibition, which drew 470,000 visitors. The downturn
in TF1 Vidéo’s physical video market (DVD, Blu-ray) has still to be offset
by the digital video market, but the subsidiary succeeded in increasing
sales through a new activity of “all-rights” licensing and distribution for
some titles. Téleshopping recorded a decrease in the number of orders
and a 4.2%-fall in sales.

The sharp contraction in sales from the group’s pay-TV offer can be
attributed to the deconsolidation of Eurosport International on 30 May 2014
and of Eurosport France on 31 March 2015, and to the discontinuation of
the Stylia channel in late 2014.

The €8-million fall in sales of “Holding company and other” resulted from
the divestment of OneCast in fourth-quarter 2014.

In 2015, 97.0% of TF1 group sales were generated in France, 2.6% in
Europe (excluding France) and 0.4% in the rest of the world.

Improvement in current operating profit

After leading a major savings drive between 2008 and 2014, the TF1 group
continued to play close attention to trends in its cost base.

Programming costs for the four freeview channels fell €38 million year-
on-year, from €994 million in 2014 to €956 million in 2015 as a result of
tight cost control and no Football World Cup.

Excluding the cost of sports events, and excluding the effects of replaced
programmes, the cost of programmes rose slightly, by €3 million, amid
an intense competitive environment in terms of programming. The DTT
channels increased their investments in programmes through the enhanced
circulation of rights between the channels, thereby strengthening their
position in a fragmented sector.

Other current operating expenses (including depreciation and
impairments) fell €91 million to €890 million. The decrease resulted

56  BOUYGUES | 2015 Registration Document

from the aforementioned scope effects (Eurosport France, OneCast and
Stylia), from the difference in the costs of rights sold (after write-backs
on provisions) for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ and the 2015 Rugby
World Cup, and from the adaptation of the Metronews cost base.

TF1’s current operating profit totalled €158 million, €15 million higher
than the figure of €143 million in 2014 (of which €26 million from
Eurosport International). All the sub-sectors made a positive contribution
to current operating profit. Operating margin increased by 1.5 points to
7.9%, compared with 6.4% in 2014.

The TF1 group initiated a project to transform its news operations in 2015,
leading notably to the discontinuation of the print version of the Metronews
freesheet in July 2015. The resulting adaptation costs amounted to
€17 million in 2015, with operating profit coming out at €141 million.

The group was in a net surplus cash position for the period. The share of
companies accounted for by the equity method decreased by €9 million
owing to the fall in the share of the net profit of the Eurosport group,
49%-owned by TF1 until 1 October 2015. Income tax expense declined
by €26 million.

In 2014, the TF1 group booked a capital gain from the sale of Eurosport
to Discovery Communications on 30 May 2014 for €300 million and from
the net profit of Eurosport International for the months of January to May.
Consequently, net profit fell €316 million year on year to €103 million.

Positive net cash position

At 31 December 2015, shareholders’ equity attributable to the TF1 group
came to €1,742 million, for total assets of €3,214 million. The group’s net
cash position stood at €701 million at 31 December 2015.

2.2.2.3 Business review in 2015

The benchmark television offering in France

TF1 remained the leading private-sector television group in France in
2015. It did so despite fierce competition in the freeview television market,
marked in particular by increasing viewer fragmentation and competition
from new, broader digital offers.

The combined audience share of the TF1 group’s four freeview channels
came out at 27.7% of individuals aged 4 and over, down 1 point year on
year. The group held up more strongly with the target of women aged
under 50 who are purchasing decision-makers, scoring a market share
of 32.0%, down 0.7 points.

The TF1 TV channel confirmed its leadership in 2015 through events-
driven programming that continued to appeal to a very wide range of
viewers. The channel claimed 98 of the top 100 audience ratings in 2015.
French drama, a genre that TF1 has successfully renewed, took 32 of the
top 100 spots. The channel also set the ratings record of the year with
the broadcast of the 2015 Rugby World Cup quarterfinal match between
New Zealand and France, which drew 12.2 million people according
to Médiamétrie. The channel achieved a 21.4% audience share with
individuals aged 4 and over.
The TF1 group’s DTT channels posted an excellent year. They led the DTT
sector in terms of women viewers and they grew their audience share by
12% to 8.6%. TMC’s audience share held steady at 3.6% and those of
NT1 and HD1 increased by 0.5 points each to 3.2% and 1.8% respectively.

The TF1 group’s freeview television offer will be strengthened in 2016 by
the arrival of the LCI rolling news channel, with the French broadcasting
authority (CSA) having approved the channel's migration to freeview DTT
on 17 December 2015.

Resolutely digital television

In 2015, the TF1 group strengthened its leading multi-screen offer
spanning the web, mobiles, tablets and connected TVs. Grouping the
four channels as part of a unique offer, MYTF1, has broadened the content
line-up, which is now rounded out by a 100% digital offer, XTRA.

Some 1.3 billion free videos were watched on TF1 group sites in 2015, up
20% on 2014. TF1 is the undisputed leader in catch-up TV (IPTV), reaching
the mark of 9.8 million unique viewers in October 2015.

TF1 also took a range of initiatives in 2015, in particular launching
TFOU MAX, the group’s first SVOD offer for 3-12 year-olds, and e-cinema
films on MYTF1VOD.

Strong success for other activities

Commercial activity for the consumer services business enjoyed positive
momentum in 2015. TF1 Entreprises scored commercial successes across
all of its sectors. The Harry Potter exhibition set a world record on visitor

2.2.3. Outlook for 2016

Given the poor visibility for 2016 and the absence of any lasting
improvement in the French economy, the net television advertising market
is likely to remain flat.

The TF1 group will continue to keep tight control over the cost of
programmes for its five freeview channels (including LCI), with the overall
cost for 2016 expected to be in the region of €980 million excluding major
sporting events.

numbers and Chrono Bomb was the top-selling board game in France
in 2015. While Téléshopping had a difficult year owing to a decrease in
orders, TF1 Vidéo continued to develop despite the still-difficult market.
The TF1 group’s pay-TV offer increased its profitability by renegotiating
its distribution contracts.

A committed and responsible media group

The TF1 group’s social responsibility policy and the quality, exhaustiveness
and transparency of its reporting in that area are aimed at strengthening
dialogue with stakeholders. These efforts are also aimed at promoting
trust and buy-in so as to reinforce group actions over the long term,
drive competitiveness and lend impetus to the global performance of
the group as a whole.

In 2015, the TF1 group rallied around COP21, bringing viewers broad
coverage of the event in TF1 and LCI news bulletins and special
programming on Ushuaia TV and organising conferences for its
stakeholders.

In early 2016, the TF1 group won an award from RobecoSAM as the
world’s second most efficient media-sector company on CSR.

In 2016, the group estimates that the amount of non-current expenses
could be in the region of €50 million in its news operations (launch of LCI
as a freeview channel) and in production (integration of Newen Studios).

During 2016, the TF1 group will continue to evolve the business model
of its channels, accelerate digital transformation across all its business
areas, and implement the migration of the LCI news channel to freeview.
The acquisition of Newen Studios will boost the group’s efforts to explore
new opportunities for development in production and content.

Bouygues Telecom, an operator at the hub of its customers’ digital lives

2.31 Profile

Since it was founded, Bouygues Telecom has kept pace with the needs
of its customers and innovated to enhance their digital experience by
offering solutions adapted to the many new ways people use mobile and
fixed services.

After inventing the mobile call plan in 1996, Bouygues Telecom launched
the first unlimited call plans with Neo in 2006. In 2011, Bouygues Telecom
introduced B&YOU, the market’s first SIM-only/Web-only service with no
minimum term. Bouygues Telecom upgraded its infrastructure in 2011 and
launched the first nationwide 4G network in France in 2013 to prepare for
the explosion in mobile data demand and ensure a high-quality customer
experience — a decisive factor in consumer choice. In November 2014
Bouygues Telecom radically streamlined its range of mobile plans and
now offers its customers automatic upgrades as soon as a new service
becomes available.

In order to become a convergent operator, Bouygues Telecom acquired
its own fixed network in 2008. In 2009, Bouygues Telecom invented the
market’s first quadruple-play offer (fixed and mobile telephony, internet and
television), branded “Tout-en-un ideo”, and in 2010 launched Bbox Fibre,
its first very-high-speed offering on the Numericable-SFR cable network.
In 2014, Bouygues Telecom introduced ground-breaking pricing, launching
a triple-play broadband offer for €19.99 per month to accelerate its growth
in the fixed market. In 2015, Bouygues Telecom launched the Bbox Miami,
the first TV box in partnership with Google, which combines the wealth
of traditional TV content with the world of the web thanks to its Android
operating system. 2015 also saw the release of a very-high-speed offering
on Bouygues Telecom’s own Fibre-to-the-Home (FTTH) network.

Bouygues Telecom is also a founding member of the LoRa (Long Range)
Alliance, which was formed to promote this technology and standardise
it around the world for the Internet of Things. Bouygues Telecom is rolling
out a LoRa network that will cover most of France by the first half of 2016.
The network is being trialled by a host of companies in areas such as
logistics and energy monitoring.

2.3.11 Market position

In a French mobile market? that totalled 80 million customers at end-2015,
Bouygues Telecom was in third position with 11.9 million customers,
behind Orange and Numericable-SFR, but ahead of Free Mobile and the
MVNOs?. Bouygues Telecom had a 14.9% share of the mobile market at
end-2015, 0.5 points higher than at end-2014.

In a French fixed broadband market? with 26.9 million customers at end-
2015, Bouygues Telecom ranked fourth with 2.8 million customers, behind
Orange, Iliad and Numericable-SFR. Bouygues Telecom had 10.4% of
the French fixed broadband market at end-2015, 1 point more than at
end-2014, and a 9.5% share of the very-high-speed market at end-2015.

Bouygues Telecom only operates in mainland France.

2.3.1.2 Development strategy

and opportunities

Bouygues Telecom has positioned itself as the dependable operator that
helps people to take full advantage of digital technologies, with a three-
pronged strategy:

Creating value by developing mobile data uses

Bouygues Telecom’s excellent nationwide 4G network provides the
company with a lasting competitive edge that sets it apart in a fiercely
competitive market. On the back of a 4G network that covers 75% of the
French population, Bouygues Telecom continues to roll out new base
stations and is targeting 4G coverage of 82% at end-2016 and 99% in
2018, essentially via the network-sharing agreement with Numericable-
SFR. Together with the rollout of new base stations, Bouygues Telecom
has increased the density of its mobile network by aggregating two and
three frequency bands to offer its customers speeds of up to nearly
300 Mbit/s. Bouygues Telecom can accommodate customers’ growing
mobile data usage due to its wide range of frequency bands, which
account for 25% of the spectrum available in France.

Bouygues Telecom’s high-quality network and enhanced products and
services enable the company to attract customers who are potentially
high mobile data consumers and support them as they develop their
uses. Growing numbers of customers are purchasing mobile data top-ups,
meaning that value is now beginning to be unlocked from this increased
data usage.

Pursuing growth in the fixed business by widening
access to broadband and very-high-speed services
to as many people as possible

In a bid to accelerate growth in the fixed market, Bouygues Telecom has
been marketing high-quality broadband offers at very competitive prices
since 2014. In 2015, Bouygues Telecom launched an attractively priced
FTTH offer to establish a presence in this market. In order to increase
the number of households eligible for these ground-breaking low rates,
Bouygues Telecom has stepped up the development of its directly-owned
fixed infrastructure.

Developing Business and Corporate as well as
Internet of Things‘ services

The business segment is a key avenue of growth for Bouygues Telecom.
The Bouygues Telecom Entreprises customer base has risen considerably
since the launch of the 4G network and the expansion of innovative fixed
broadband products and services.

Bouygues Telecom also aims to support the development of the Internet
of Things (loT) by deploying a Long Range (LoRa) network, which will
cover 50% of France by the first half of 2016 and be completed by the
end of the year, and by creating a subsidiary called Objenious to market
services to businesses.

(a) Most recent data published by Arcep (French telecommunications regulator). Scope: “Mainland France” for the mobile market. “Mainland France and French overseas
departments” for fixed broadband (including very-high-speed). Very-high-speed subscriptions are those with a peak download speed of 30 Mbit/s or more (Arcep definition).

2.3.1.3 Strengths and assets

Bouygues Telecom boasts an array of strengths and assets:

A customer base of 14.7 million

Bouygues Telecom had 11.9 million mobile customers at end-2015 and
2.8 million on the fixed broadband and very-high-speed market.

High-performance mobile and fixed networks
acclaimed for their quality

With over 15,000 sites, Bouygues Telecom offers its customers coverage
with its directly-owned network that reaches:

m= 99% of the French population in 2G;
m= 97% of the French population in 3G+;
m= 75% of the French population in 4G.

Consumer perception surveys of mobile networks such as nPerf and
4Gmark regularly rank Bouygues Telecom in first place in France for
download speeds and the overall user experience?.

In broadband, Bouygues Telecom is able to market its offers to all telephone
lines eligible for broadband, which include 16.1 million households
via its own directly-owned network. In the very-high-speed segment,
Bouygues Telecom stepped up the rollout of its FTTH network, covering
1.5 million connections marketed at end-2015. Under an agreement with
Numericable-SFR, Bouygues Telecom can potentially reach 7 to 8 million
households eligible for FTTLA (Fibre To The Last Amplifier).

Access to a wide frequency spectrum

At end-2015, Bouygues Telecom had access to frequencies in a number
of different bands (700, 800, 900, 1800, 2100 and 2600 MHz).

Bouygues Telecom has invested around €2 billion in accessing regulated
frequencies, thereby gaining a long-term competitive advantage to keep
pace with the explosion in its customers’ mobile data consumption. Thanks
to this wide range of frequency bands and the technology underpinning
its network infrastructure, Bouygues Telecom has been able to aggregate

its various frequency bands to offer even faster speeds and improved
quality of service.

Unique positioning

Building on its “#NosClientsDabord” (“Customer First”) strategy,
Bouygues Telecom is the only operator in the market to boast a positioning
which favours existing customers by rewarding their loyalty through a
range of initiatives, including automatic upgrades to mobile plans for
all subscribers, promotional offers for customers and the creation of a
“Customer Committee”.

Attractive mobile and fixed services

Bouygues Telecom simplified its range of mobile plans in 2014, offering
seven plans either with or without a phone. All customers enjoy automatic
upgrades to their plans as soon as a new service becomes available, with
no obligation to sign up to a new contract and at no extra cost.

Bouygues Telecom offers a competitive line of fixed services while
continuing to deliver superior quality. Released in 2015, Bouygues
Telecom’s fixed broadband package is the lowest-priced service in the
market.

All-new distribution and support network
for an enhanced customer experience

Bouygues Telecom provides all its customers with daily support through
an excellent customer relations service that includes 4,500 customer and
sales advisers, 544 Club Bouygues Telecom stores, a website, social
media and on-line assistants.

In 2015 Bouygues Telecom rolled out an omni-channel digital platform
called Salesforce, the global leader in customer relationship management
products, and introduced a new store concept to streamline the purchasing
process and improve the customer experience

Strong capability to adapt

To meet the challenges of market upheaval and improve its competitiveness
in a market with four operators, Bouygues Telecom has adapted swiftly
to the new landscape and transformed its business model for increased
agility.

2.3.2 Business activity in 2015

Bouygues Telecom successfully continued its aggressive strategy
in the mobile and fixed segments in 2015 while pursuing its in-depth
transformation. These efforts flowed through to solid commercial
performance and improved financial results.

2.3.2.1 Business review

The French mobile? and fixed broadband® market

The French telecommunications market has experienced sweeping
change for a number of years, impacted by several underlying trends.
These trends were confirmed by events in 2015, especially:

= Increased competitive pressure in both the mobile and fixed segments,
coupled with a surge in promotional offers;

= Growing appeal of very-high-speed fixed and mobile services as
customers increasingly access video and content on demand at home
and on the move. This usage has been boosted by new types of content
such as Netflix and the growth of 4G and FTTH, together with the
inclusion of new services in mobile plans (larger data allowances, cloud
computing, roaming’, etc.);

m= Customer handset purchase behaviour changed as SIM-only sales
rose sharply and new ways of financing handset purchases emerged
(pre-owned phone market, consumer loans, etc.);

= Sales at third-party distribution channels declined as web-only sales
gathered pace.

The French mobile phone market totalled 69.5 million SIM cards, excluding
machine-to-machine? SIM cards, and continued to expand in 2015,
increasing by 0.7% compared with 2014. Growth was driven by the 4.2%
rise in the number of plan customers. The prepaid market contracted by
a further 14.2% in 2015 compared with 2014.

Machine-to-machine SIM cards numbered 10.5 million, a sharp increase
of 27.8% compared with 2014.

Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) accounted for 9.2% of the total
mainland France subscriber base (including MtoM) versus 9.4% in 2014.

The number of fixed broadband and very-high-speed subscriptions
reached 26.9 million at end-2015, representing net growth of 894,000
subscriptions year-on-year (up 3.4%), driven by the marked increase in
very-high-speed subscriptions®, which rose by 43.8%.

Bouygues Telecom’s commercial results
in the mobile market

Bouygues Telecom’s mobile business regained momentum in 2015 and its
customer base continued to rapidly transition to 4G. Bouygues Telecom’s
high-quality 4G network, enhanced products and services and new
positioning have enabled the company to attract customers who are

potentially heavy mobile data users and at the same time reduce churn
rates among existing customers.

MOBILE SERVICES

Bouygues Telecom enhanced its mobile products and services in 2015 in
a bid to help customers to develop their usage and boost loyalty. In early
2015, all customers on Sensation 3GB plans and above were offered a
choice of four bonus services — Spotify Premium, Gameloft, CanalPlay
Start and unlimited B.TV (television on mobile handsets and on tablets).
Bouygues Telecom’s entire mobile customer base also enjoyed several
weekends of unlimited free mobile internet so they could enjoy the full
range of the company’s 4G services.

In October 2013, Bouygues Telecom was the first operator to roll out a
nationwide 4G network. The company boosted 4G coverage in 2015 to
offer 4G+ services at faster speeds. This was achieved by aggregating
three frequency bands to deliver unparalleled mobile internet speeds of
up to nearly 300 Mbit/s. Boosted 4G services are available in Chartres
and Lyon and will be extended to Paris and surrounding areas in 2016 as
well as cities with populations of more than 400,000.

FREQUENCIES

Bouygues Telecom is also consolidating its lead in mobile internet services
for the years ahead by accessing a wider frequency spectrum. Following
the French government’s auction of frequencies in the 700 MHz band in
late 2015, Bouygues Telecom was awarded a block of 5 MHz.

COMMERCIAL PERFORMANCE

Mobile customers

Bouygues Telecom’s mobile customer base grew by 769,000 customers in
2015 to 11.9 million customers, compared with a loss of 23,000 customers
in 2014. Bouygues Telecom gained 504,000 more mobile plan customers
excluding MtoM in the full-year 2015, compared with an increase of
177,000 customers in fourth quarter.

4G proves a success

At end-2015, Bouygues Telecom had 5.1 million active 4G customers’,
representing 51% of its mobile customer base excluding MtoM.

Since the launch of 4G, Bouygues Telecom’s customers have developed
new mobile internet use patterns. Mobile customers (excluding MtoM)
consumed an average of 1.4GB of data per month in the fourth quarter
of 2015, compared with 0.9GB in the year-earlier period, and active
4G customers consumed an average of 2.5GB of data per month.
Bouygues Telecom’s customers are the biggest consumers of mobile
data in France. Bouygues Telecom carries 26% ? of all mobile internet
traffic (8G and 4G) in France, equivalent to nearly double its share of the
mobile market.

In addition, nearly 30% of 4G customers on 3GB plans use their entire
monthly data allowance and growing numbers of them buy top-ups

around 500,000 at end-2015.

MVNOs

There were 2.6 million active MVNO customers® on the Bouygues Telecom
network at end-2015, 400,000 more than at end-2014. The increase was
mainly due to the agreements concluded between Bouygues Telecom and
Lebara Mobile and Lycamobile, MVNOs that target individuals looking for
attractively-priced international calling.

Bouygues Telecom’s commercial results in the fixed
broadband market

Bouygues Telecom continued to grow in the fixed broadband market in
2015 by offering high-quality services at attractive prices.

FIXED BROADBAND SERVICES

Launched in 2014, the Bbox triple-play broadband offer priced at
€19.99 per month continued to prove hugely popular. It includes all the
basic services — phone, internet and television — at a very attractive price.

In another technological breakthrough, Bouygues Telecom rolled out
Bbox Miami in early 2015 to meet customers’ growing appetite for video
and content on demand. Combining the very best of TV and the web with
a single Android interface (Google’s mobile operating system), Bbox Miami
was designed with an ecosystem of partners (IfeelSmart, iWedia, Marvell,
Spidéo and Google) to offer the best customer TV viewing experience.
This TV box is competitively priced at €25.99 per month and is compatible
with FTTH technology. It provides speeds of up to 1 Gb/s and enables
subscribers to surf the net, download at ultra-fast speeds, watch TV in
high definition and enjoy a multitude of services at optimal quality, all at
the same time.

FASTER ROLLOUT OF THE DIRECTLY-OWNED NETWORK

Bouygues Telecom stepped up the rollout of its directly-owned fixed
infrastructure - ADSL and FTTH — in order to provide services to as many
households as possible at highly competitive prices and increase its share
of the broadband and very-high-speed market.

m= Bouygues Telecom’s directly-owned ADSL network covered 16.1 million
households at end-December 2015 via more than 1,500 central offices,
compared to 700 at end-2014.

= Inthe very-high-speed market, the company concluded co-investment
agreements with Orange and Numericable-SFR concerning the rollout
of optical fibre in Very Dense and Less Dense areas, reaching a total
of 6.5 million connections. At end-2015, Bouygues Telecom’s directly-
owned unbundled FTTH network covered 1.5 million connections,
allowing customers to access speeds of up to 1Gb/s. In 2013,
Bouygues Telecom started to include VDSL2 in its fixed broadband
offers at no extra cost, delivering theoretical download speeds of up
to 100 Mbit/s. VDSL2 enables Bouygues Telecom to further expand its
very-high-speed coverage in France.

To offer very-high-speed services to as many customers as possible,
Bouygues Telecom also has access to the Numericable-SFR network,
covering a potential 7-8 million households and offering speeds of up
to 200 Mbit/s.

COMMERCIAL PERFORMANCE

For the past two years, Bouygues Telecom has consistently performed
well in the fixed broadband market, posting average net quarterly growth
of 97,000 customers. Bouygues Telecom accounted for 40.3% of total
net growth of the French fixed broadband market in 2015, attracting
360,000 new customers.

Bouygues Telecom had 2.8 million fixed broadband customers at
end-December 2015, including 406,000 very-high-speed customers,
representing 14.6% of its base. Bouygues Telecom’s FTTH customers
numbered 39,000, reflecting the market launch of the FTTH offer in mid-
2015.

Development of new growth opportunities

INTERNET OF THINGS

Bouygues Telecom is a founding member of the LoRa Alliance, which
includes more than 140 members from around the world. Already being
deployed by market leaders in many countries, Long Range (LoRa)
technology is globally recognised as the most advanced technology for
Internet of Things applications. Bouygues Telecom currently deploys
a LoRa network that will cover most of France by the end of 2016.
Objenious, a Bouygues Telecom subsidiary, will soon market a catalogue
of products and services aimed at businesses for a variety of uses such as
the geolocation of things, predictive maintenance and energy monitoring.

BUSINESS AND CORPORATE SERVICES

Bouygues Telecom’s business and corporate activity has developed
into a particularly dynamic growth driver since the launch of 4G.
Combining a high-quality network with innovative products and services,
Bouygues Telecom Entreprises has been growing strongly for more than
two years. In 2015, Bouygues Telecom Entreprises saw its mobile business
customer base increase by 19% and its fixed business customer base
grow by 23%.

In June 2015, Bouygues Telecom Entreprises was the first operator
to offer its fixed services via 4G. The 4G Access Router solution lets
businesses quickly access a very-high-speed internet connection with
quality comparable to a Fibre-to-the-Office (FTTO) solution. The 4G
Access Router also provides very-high-speed access to a company’s
Virtual Private Network (VPN) and serves as a back-up for fixed fibre
or DSL connections. As part of its digital transformation, the Société
Générale bank has equipped more than 3,000 of its branches with
Bouygues Telecom Entreprises 4G Access Routers, giving it the benefits
of secure very-high-speed access and fast installation.

As part of Bouygues Telecom’s strategic partnership with Telefonica since
2012, Telefonica Global Solutions France was created in 2015 to serve the
market for multinational companies. The new joint venture integrates the
sales and marketing teams of the two operators in order to provide best-
in-breed telecommunications services to multinationals. It will leverage

France can access comprehensive, personalised phone solutions (mobile,
fixed, mobile internet, collaboration tools and enhanced digital services).

Bouygues Telecom had two million business and corporate customers
for its fixed and mobile services at end-2015.

2.3.2.2 Financial review

Bouygues Telecom improved its financial results in 2015 by delivering
robust commercial performance and transforming its business model. For
the first year since 2010, Bouygues Telecom’s total sales and EBITDA?
were both up on the previous year’s figures.

Bouygues Telecom’s ongoing transformation

Bouygues Telecom embarked on an in-depth transformation plan in
2012 to adjust the company’s cost structure to declining value in the
market and return the company to a more agile business model in order
to meet customer needs even more effectively. Actions to speed up
Bouygues Telecom’s transformation in 2015 included:

= reducing the workforce by 1,362 employees in the company’s support
functions. This was finalised in early 2015 through a voluntary
redundancy scheme;

= migrating the entire mobile customer base to new plans (seven plans
remain in the range), simplifying business operations and improving
customer service;

= setting up an omni-channel digital platform with Salesforce, the global
leader in customer relationship management products, to streamline
the purchasing process and unify information, regardless of the chosen
point of contact;

= launch of a programme to modernise the network of stores for a more
welcoming customer experience and a streamlined purchasing process,
which should be completed in 2017;

= opening the first shared network zones. Numericable-SFR and
Bouygues Telecom are sharing a portion of their mobile access network
infrastructure across an area covering 57% of the population (excluding
Very Dense areas).

This will enable both operators to provide their respective customers with
better coverage outside and inside buildings, as well as better quality of
service while generating significant savings;

= rolling out a new logo and a new tagline — “We Love Technology” — to
underscore Bouygues Telecom’s renewal.

As a result of Bouygues Telecom’s major efforts to streamline, improve
and simplify the company, the cost reduction plan unveiled in early 2014,
which was expected to generate €300 million in cost savings in 2016
compared with end-2013 (operating and marketing costs excluding taxes
and fees), should now deliver at least €400 million in cost savings in 2016.

Financial results

Bouygues Telecom reported sales of €4,505 million in 2015, 2% higher
than in 2014.

Sales from network amounted to €3,825 million in 2015, down 1% versus
2014, due to the impact of the end of repricing the customer base in the
first half of 2015. Sales from network returned to growth in the second
half of 2015, buoyed by an increase in the number of customers and
stabilisation of mobile Average Revenue Per User? (ARPU), which stands
at €22.8.

Fixed broadband ARPU* amounted to €28.10 per customer per month in
the fourth quarter of 2015, down 5% on the year-earlier period. This
decline was linked to the growing popularity among the customer base
of the new Bbox broadband range priced at €19.99 per month.

As expected, EBITDA stood at €752 million in 2015, €58 million higher
than in 2014. This increase was due to efforts to radically streamline the
company, savings partly achieved out of the €400 million in cost savings
expected in 2016 compared with 2013 and the emergence of a more agile,
efficient business model.

The current operating loss amounted to €11 million, an improvement of
€54 million compared with 2014.

The operating loss stood at €134 million, compared with a loss of
€62 million in 2014, after factoring in non-current charges of €123 million,
essentially related to the rollout of network sharing with Numericable-SFR.

The year ended with a consolidated net loss attributable to the group of
€65 million, compared with a consolidated net loss of €45 million in 2014.

Consolidated capital expenditure amounted to €1,289 million in 2015. This
was up €605 million on 2014 due to the acquisition of a block of 700 MHz
frequencies in 2015 for €467 million. Stripping out these frequencies,
capital expenditure was €822 million, up €138 million versus 2014. The
main items were the rollout of the 4G network, continued expansion of the
3G network, the rollout of the fixed ADSL and FTTH network, and home
gateways for new customers.

Free cash flow excluding frequencies was (€125) million down €263 million
versus 2014. This expected decline was due to a tough comparison base
resulting from the exceptional items of 2014. Total net debt stood at
€890 million at end-2015, compared with €765 million at end-2014.

(a) EBITDA = current operating profit + net depreciation and amortisation expense + net provisions and impairment losses - reversals of unutilised provisions and impairment

losses.

2.3.3 Outlook for 2016

Bouygues Telecom’s aggressive strategy and the in-depth transformation
of its business model delivered, as expected, the first positive results in
2015. The company achieved a good commercial performance in the
mobile and fixed broadband segments, and it started to see the first signs
of monetisation of mobile data. Furthermore, both sales and EBITDA
increased in 2015.

In these conditions, Bouygues Telecom confirms its target of a return to
long-term growth in sales and profits.

(a) The EBITDA margin is calculated on sales from network.

It aims to gain an additional 1 million mobile customers and 1 million fixed
broadband customers by end-2017 compared to 2014 and is targeting
an EBITDA margin? of 25% for end-2017 and of 35% in the longer term.

In 2016, the plan to save at least €400 million (versus end-2013) should
have a full effect and capital expenditure should be between €750 and
€800 million.

2.4.2 Management

2.41 Internal control - Risk
management - Compliance

From its inception, the Bouygues group has made risk management one of the cornerstones of its
corporate culture because its founder had a highly innovative vision of the construction business,
the Group's first activity.

Today Bouygues SA, the Group’s parent company, regards internal control, risk management
and compliance as being among its core missions. Many actions have been taken in each of the
five business segments over a number of years, on the parent company’s initiative and under its
supervision. They are organised around three strands: an Internal Control Reference Manual, self-
assessment of the implementation of the core principles of this reference manual, and identification
and monitoring of major risks.

In accordance with the Group’s Code of Ethics, compliance is one of the key objectives of these three
policies. In close cooperation with its business segments, Bouygues SA has drawn up compliance
programmes relating to: competition, anti-corruption, financial information and securities trading,
and conflicts of interest. The programmes were approved by the Board of Directors in January 2014
and have been widely distributed around the Group.

A description of the Group’s internal control and risk management system is given in the Report by
the Chairman of the Board of Directors in chapter 5, section 5.2.2, of this document.

Bouygues SA pays particular attention to management of the Group, taking steps to encourage exchanges and share experience between support
structures and business segments, motivate staff and develop team spirit within the Group. The main actions in this sphere in 2015 are described in
chapter 3 “Human resources, environmental and social information” of this document.

2.4.4 Theshareholding in Alstom

Alstom completed the sale of its Energy activities to General Electric on
2 November 2015.

At their meeting on 18 December 2015, Alstom’s shareholders approved
the distribution of about €3.2 billion to shareholders through a public
share buy-back offer on a maximum of 91.5 million shares at a unit price
of €35, the repurchased shares then being cancelled.

On 28 January 2016, Alstom announced the results of its public share
buy-back offer. Within the scope of this operation, Alstom repurchased
28.46 million Alstom shares held by Bouygues at a price of €35 per share,
for a total amount of €996 million. After the repurchase, the Bouygues
group therefore held 62.1 million shares representing 28.3% of Alstom’s
capital, compared with 29.2% at 31 December 2015.

On a proposal from Bouygues, Alstom’s shareholders’ meeting on
18 December 2015 also approved the appointment of Mr. Olivier Bourges,
Group General Counsel, PSA, as a director recommended by the French
government.

On 22 June 2014, Bouygues concluded an agreement with the French
government giving the latter an option to acquire up to 20% of Alstom’s
capital from Bouygues under certain conditions. On 4 February 2016, under
the terms of this agreement, Bouygues loaned the French government
20% of Alstom’s capital and voting rights.

Further information is given in sections 2.5 and 6.1.3.2 of this document.

European institutions. Bouygues Europe works for both Bouygues SA and
its subsidiaries, advising them and representing them in the European
institutions as well as monitoring legislation and regulation on issues
of key importance to Group companies. In order to guide its action,
Bouygues Europe has set up an advisory committee comprising a

2.4.8.2 Bouygues Asia

Bouygues Asia KK, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bouygues SA set

technological advances, organising field trips and identifying partners
that could collaborate with either Bouygues SA or its business segments.

68 BOUYGUES | 2015 Registration Document

There are no significant flows of funds between the Group’s business
segments. Cash management is centralised within financial subsidiaries
wholly owned by the Bouygues SA parent company. This arrangement
ensures optimum management of financial expenses, since the surplus
cash generated by certain subsidiaries can be used in addition to or in
place of confirmed lines of credit granted by credit institutions to others.
When investing surplus cash, Bouygues has always avoided speculative
instruments such as securitisation vehicles and high-yield mutual funds.

Bouygues Asia’s activity is consistent with the Bouygues group’s
determination to identify new trends, promote innovation within the Group
and support Group companies by creating and growing partnerships in
Asia. The activities of Bouygues Asia cover a very wide geographical
area that includes Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan. Bouygues Asia
also offers its assistance and services to customers outside the Group,
in particular French SME’s wishing to set up or develop further in Asia.

2.4.8.4 Bouygues Développement

In January 2015, Bouygues acquired the entire share capital of
BTI Développement, an Open Innovation company owned by
Bouygues Telecom, and renamed it Bouygues Développement. Serving

Trains

Alstom’s range of trains spans the entire market from very high-speed
trains to urban transport.

When it comes to improving the capacity, operating frequency and safety
of their fleets while protecting the environment, operators can rely on
Alstom’s innovative and economically efficient urban solutions. From
Citadis tramways, Citadis Dualis tram-trains and Metropolis metros
to X’Trapolis suburban trains, Alstom works daily to meet the mobility
challenge.

One of Alstom’s priorities is to help make rail competitive in comparison
with air or road transport. Alstom supports regional mobility with its
Coradia range and its passenger locomotives. It is redrawing the high-
speed and very high-speed map with Coradia Liner V200 and its Avelia
range, based on three flagship products: Pendolino, Euroduplex and AGV.
Alstom also supports the freight market with its Prima locomotives and
those developed with its partners TMH in Russia and KTZ in Kazakhstan.

Systems

Alstom brings together all its cross-cutting know-how as a rail manufacturer
to manage urban rail systems in their entirety, including trains, signalling,
infrastructure and services.

INFRASTRUCTURE

Alstom offers a comprehensive range of sustainable solutions for
tracklaying, electrification and the supply of electromechanical equipment
for installation in stations and depots.

Alstom designs and installs innovative solutions for automated tracklaying
with Appitrack, energy efficiency with Hesop, a reversible power-supply
substation, and non-catenary power supply with solutions such as APS
(ground-level power supply) and SRS, its latest ground-based static
charging system.

INTEGRATED SYSTEMS

Operators often seek comprehensive solutions to their needs in order
to tackle complex projects or better focus on their core business. That
is what Alstom offers its customers, whether on the urban transport or
mainline market, ensuring optimised costs, faster delivery times and an
optimal level of performance for all equipment.

For example Attractis, Alstom’s latest integrated tramway system for
fast-growing cities, has recently confirmed its number one position in
this segment.

Signalling

Alstom supports infrastructure operators and managers with the means
to carry passengers and goods safely and seamlessly, thus optimising the
efficiency of urban or mainline networks. It provides them with control and
information systems and with onboard and trackside equipment. As well
as traveller information and comfort, they guarantee operating efficiency
and safety. Alstom also develops passenger safety solutions and network
management control centres.

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
Alstom

Following the recent acquisition of General Electric’s signalling solutions,
Alstom has strengthened its position on the mining and freight markets,
especially in the United States.

Services

Alstom accompanies its customers, whether public or private rail
operators, fleet administrators or maintenance specialists, by offering
a range of customised services (maintenance, modernisation, parts and
repairs, support services) for their trains, infrastructure and rail control
systems.

The goal is to ensure safe, global management optimised throughout
service life.

2.5.1.3 An ambitious strategy for 2020

The railway market, driven by increasing urbanisation, is growing steadily.
In a context of globalisation and consolidation, Alstom is pursuing a
strategy in line with its ambition to become its customers’ preferred partner
for transport solutions by 2020. This strategy is based on five priorities:

= Customer-focused organisation: present in sixty countries, Alstom
has adapted its organisation to strengthen its international coverage
and better respond to the needs of customers at local level. This
approach is based on seven regions? responsible for overall project
execution, and a dedicated signalling organisation. They draw ona
network of local industrial sites, joint ventures and strategic partnerships
around the globe. They are supported by a head office that manages
overall strategy, product policy, innovation and implementation of joint
processes. Alstom’s signalling business reinforces its position with a
large network of skill centres;

= Complete range of solutions: Alstom draws on an array of expertise
spanning all rail transport segments to offer customers comprehensive
solutions. These range from bundling options to integrated solutions,
ensuring optimised costs, faster delivery times and an optimal level of
performance for all equipment;

= Value creation through innovation: because it ensures customers
more effective solutions and reduced cost of ownership, innovation is
a source of competitiveness and differentiation for Alstom as well as a
catalyst for new contracts and markets. It spans technical innovation,
via the introduction of a number of R&D programmes, as well as new
financing solutions and services to continually enhance added value
for customers.

Alstom is fully focused on a forward-looking approach to understand
and anticipate the expectations of operators and passengers, who are
central to its innovation strategy.

= Operational and environmental excellence: to improve customer
satisfaction, Alstom executes its projects with a focus on ensuring the
highest standards in quality, costs and lead times. This operational
excellence goes hand in hand with a commitment to environmental
performance in response to high market demand with regard to
products (energy savings), manufacturing processes (eco-design and
green materials) and lifecycle management (recycling);

2.5.2 Business activity

2.5.2) Methodology

In the context of the project between Alstom and General Electric and in
compliance with IFRS 5, the Thermal Power, Renewable Power and Grid
activities and some corporate costs have been classified as discontinued
operations. Those activities are therefore not included in order intake,
sales, income from operations and EBIT.

2.5.2.2 Commercial activity

FY 2014/15 results

Between 1 April 2014 and 31 March 2015, Alstom booked a record
€10 billion of orders, up by more than 60% on the previous year. The
book-to-bill ratio, at 1.6, was above 1 for the fifth year in a row and
was notably boosted by a €4 billion contract in South Africa. Sales, at
€6.2 billion, were up 8% (7% on a like-for-like basis) over the previous year
and income from operations amounted to €318 million, up 19%. Alstom
group reported a net loss from continued and discontinued operations of
€719 million, affected by a number of exceptional items, in particular the
agreement with the US Department of Justice and some asset write-offs
in Russia. As expected, free cash flow from continued operations (before
tax and financial cash-out) was positive for the full year and Alstom group
free cash flow was substantially positive over the second half of the year,
offsetting a large part of the first-half cash outflow, yielding a full-year
figure of negative €429 million.

H1 2015/16 results

Between 1 April and 30 September 2015, Alstom booked a strong
€3.9 billion of orders corresponding to a book-to-bill of 1.2. Over the
same period, sales were up 8% (4% like-for-like and at constant exchange
rates), amounting to €3.3 billion. Operating income (after corporate costs)
increased to €167 million, 10% above the €152 million recorded in the
first half of the previous year.

Net income from continued operations (group share) reached €18 million
and free cash flow from continued operations (before tax and financial
cash-out) was around zero.

and at constant exchange rates) compared to the first nine months of
2014/15. The book-to-bill remained strong at 1.3.

At €28.7 billion on 31 December 2015, the order book represented over
four years of sales.
