Fiscal 2014 Activity Report

3.1 Fiscal 2014 Activity Report

> 3.1.1 FISCAL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS

Sodexo's development model is based primarily on organic
growth, achieved by leveraging the considerable potential
offered by the worldwide outsourcing market.

Its Quality of Life Service offer is an important source
of competitive differentiation. Sodexo is also the only
company in the world to offer its clients On-site Services,
Benefits and Rewards Services and Personal and Home
Services, and as such is uniquely positioned to improve
the quality of life.

During the Board meeting, Sodexo's Chief Executive Officer
Michel Landel observed that quality of life has become
widely recognized as an agent of progress for people and
a performance driver for companies and organizations.
Bu placing people and the well-being of everyone it serves
at the center of its organization, Sodexo has evolved
from being a service provider to a creator of well-being
experiences built on its deep understanding of consumers’
and clients’ needs.

During Fiscal 2014, Sodexo continued to invest in
executing its long-term strategy to become the world’s
leading provider of Quality of Life Services. These
investments primarily concerned three key drivers of
sustainable growth for the Group:

e human resources development, through team training,
strengthened employee engagement, opportunities for
managers to obtain international experience and an
assertive diversity policy;

e continuous improvements in technical expertise, with
facilities management services now accounting for
28% of consolidated revenues. Sodexo offers over 100
different services to companies, universities, hospitals,
retirement homes and prisons, and to private
individuals. In Fiscal 2014, facilities management
revenues rose sharply in several geographic markets,
particularly the United Kingdom, continental Europe
and Asia, as well as in the Corporate segment in North
America, with growth rates ranging from 5% to 17%;

e expansion in high potential markets, particularly in
emerging countries. These markets currently represent
nearly 20% of the Group’s On-site Services revenue,
while the Benefits and Rewards Services activity has
issue volume of more than 7 billion euro in Latin
America, compared to 5 billion euro ten years ago (in
Fiscal 2004).

Financial performance for Fiscal 2014 was once again

very robust and fully in line with the targets set at the

beginning of the year:

e consolidated revenues totaled 18 billion euro;

e organic growth was 2.3%;

e reported operating profit was 939 million euro, after
including 27 million euro in exceptional costs for the

program to improve operational efficiency and reduce
costs.

Excluding these exceptional costs, operating profit
was 966 million euro, up 10.7% from Fiscal 2013
excluding currency effects;

e reported Group net profit was 490 million euro, up
by more than 20% excluding currency effects and
by 11.6% after taking into account the significant
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
observed in Fiscal 2014;

e net cash provided by operating activities totaled
825 million euro versus 618 million euro in Fiscal 2013,
demonstrating once again Sodexo’s ability to generate
Jarge amounts of cash year after year.

Michel Landel mentioned to his fellow Board members
that the Group had achieved these performances in a
complicated macro-economic environment and despite
considerably slower global economic growth, thanks to
the hard work of Sodexo’s 419,000 employees

In 2005, the Group set the target of achieving 7% average
annual growth in revenues and 11% average annual
growth in operating profit over the next ten years. Between
Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2014, revenues grew by an average
of nearly 6% per year and operating profit by an average
of around 10% excluding currency effects.

Michel Landel explained to the Board that like other
international groups that present their consolidated
financial statements in euro, in Fiscal 2014 all of Sodexo's
income statement items were severely affected by negative
currency effects resulting from changes in average
exchange rates between Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2014
He also noted that, unlike exporting companies, Sodexo
is not exposed to any operational risks as a result of
exchange rate fluctuations, because each subsidiary bills
its revenues and incurs its expenses in the same currency

The Group’s financial ratios also improved during
Fiscal 2014, reflecting the quality of Sodexo’s strategic
choices and the robustness of its financial model
Attesting to the Group's financial strength, in the middle
of the year Standard & Poor's raised its rating to A-. Prior
to that, between 1998, when Standard & Poor's rated the
Group for the first time, and February 2014, Sodexo had
always been rated BBB+.

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Fiscal 2014 Activity Report

During Fiscal 2014, Sodexo also successfully carried
out two major debt issues on the international financial
markets, using the proceeds to refinance more than two-
thirds of the Group's structural long-term debt at lower
interest rates

e in the spring of 2014, the Group borrowed 1.1 billion
U.S. dollars through a private placement with U.S
investors (U.S. Private Placement) structured in five
tranches with maturities of 5, 7, 10, 12, and 15 years;

e then in the summer of 2014, Sodexo completed
a 1.1 billion euro bond issuance structured in two
tranches: a 600 million euro tranche maturing in
7.5 years and another tranche for 500 million euro
maturing in 12 years.

Both issues were significantly oversubscribed by investors.
They enabled the Group to extend the maturity of its debt,
better align the respective foreign currency exposures of
its borrowings and operating activities, and obtain more
attractive interest rates.

All of these factors should contribute to a continuous rise
in Group net profit and earnings per share over the next
two fiscal years.

3.1.1.1 ONGOING DEVELOPMENT

The Sodexo teams’ marketing successes with many clients
contributed to the development rate (contract wins) in
both On-site Services and Benefits and Rewards Services

In On-site Services, Sodexo's integrated service offer and
innovations won over the following clients:

e inthe Corporate segment, several new clients chose
the service offer developed by Sodexo to improve
their employees’ quality of life in the workplace. They
included EnBW, in Germany, for its 200 buildings at
53 sites; Deloitte for the ten buildings comprising
its Paris headquarters and its 17 regional offices in
France; TetraPak for its second largest plant in India,
and Telefonica SA in Chile for energy management
services and maintenance of its network of telephone
masts, at 436 sites in eight cities.

Fiscal 2014 Activity Report

The Group’s international network also allows
it to partner with a growing number of major
multinational groups. These include Alcatel-Lucent,
which chose Sodexo as its worldwide Quality of Life
services provider at 250 sites in 43 countries. Sodexo
also ensures the well-being of Carlsberg’s teams at
30 sites in ten European countries, and manages a
wide range of integrated services for Rexam at 27 sites
in 15 European countries

Energy management has become a priority for a
growing number of clients. Sodexo supports their
efforts with an energy efficiency service offer that
helps them to reduce costs while also protecting the
environment;

in Health Care and Seniors, Sodexo strengthened its
global expertise by winning major contracts in Europe,
including with Imperial College Healthcare in the United
Kingdom for its four London hospitals, and the Monza
hospital in Italy for its new leukemia research and
treatment center.

This expertise also led to the renewal and extension of
Jarge existing contracts, notably in the United States
For example, Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare, a major
Wisconsin-based network of hospitals, physicians and
home health service providers, extended its partnership
with Sodexo to include maintenance and repair
services for over 22,000 types of specialized medical
appliances, while the Presbyterian Home for Central
New York, a nursing home for the elderly, awarded
Sodexo a facilities management contract in addition
to the existing foodservices contract.

University Hospitals, one of the largest health care
networks in the United States, signed a new five-year
contract with Sodexo covering environmental, food,
nutrition and facilities management services

Sodexo's global expertise in the health care market is
a key selling point for clients in emerging countries
who want to offer their patients a quality of care and
an environment aligned with the highest international
standards. This is shown by the contracts won
in Fiscal 2014 with Jaypee Hospital in Noida and
Wockhardt Hospital in Mumbai (India), The Medical
City in Manila (Philippines), Mater Dei Hospital in
Belo Horizonte (Brazil) and Jishuitan Hospital's new
Huilongguan center in Beijing (China);

e inthe Education segment, new clients chose Sodexo
to help them create a healthy, safe and welcoming
environment responding to the aspirations of their
students and employees. In the United States, Chicago
Public Schools (CPS) chose Sodexo to manage energy
infrastructure and costs at the city’s 680 schools, while
in Thailand, the Panyapiwat Institute of Management
awarded the Group a contract to provide a full range of
integrated facilities management services

University College London (UCL) was won over by the
innovative, diversified and responsible foodservices
offer proposed by Sodexo for its 25,000 students and
9,000 faculty members and staff. Sodexo’s bespoke
foodservices offers also won over Jackson State
University in Mississippi (United States), the Juvdskyla
University of Applied Sciences (Finland), the public
schools in Asniéres-sur-Seine (France), the Canadian
International School in Singapore, the Indian School
of Business (ISB) in Hyderabad (India), the University
of the Andes in Bogota (Colombia) and the Hong Kong
YMCA’s Christian College (Hong Kong);

e in Remote Sites, Australia’s largest oil and gas
producer, Woodside Energy, chose Sodexo to provide
a wide range of services including management of the
756 houses and 2,000 rooms in the camp, foodservices
for the plant, cleaning of employees’ work wear,
administrative services, technical maintenance of all
buildings other than the plant, industrial cleaning and
grounds keeping services. In the Philippines, Sodexo
provides integrated facilities management services
for the offshore and onshore sites operated by Shell
Philippines Exploration B.V. (SPEX) for the Malampaya
project, a public-private partnership between the
Philippine government and SPEX that supplies 30%
of the Philippine’s electricity needs.

In Benefits and Rewards Services, 40% of whose clients

are also served by the other Group activities, Fiscal 2014

saw a certain number of developments and innovations
For example:

e in Brazil: Sodexo expanded its offer and innovated
by proposing and deploying Vale Cultura, a solution
that provides easier access to cultural activities to the
17,000 Banco Santander employees working in the
bank's branches;

e in China, after obtaining a license from the People’s
Bank of China (PBOC) authorizing it to expand its

prepaid card offer, Sodexo launched the Tung Pass
gift card in July 2014. The card is accepted by a wide
network of affiliated merchants, including shopping
malls, fashion boutiques, home accessories stores,
supermarkets and fashionable restaurants;

e in Israel, the Group strengthened its expertise in
mobile technologies, particularly personalized digital
loyalty programs, by acquiring a stake in Keeprz;

e in Peru, Romania and the United Kingdom, Sodexo
won over mobile telephone operators to its Quality
of Life Services, in the form of employee benefits and
incentive programs for other targets.

3.1.1.2 CREATING A COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGE THROUGH
OUR PEOPLE

The world’s 18" largest private sector employer with
419,000 employees in 80 countries, Sodexo is a
community of men and women whose engagement is
key to client and consumer satisfaction and, therefore,
a genuine competitive advantage. That is why the Group
implemented several major initiatives in Fiscal 2014
in pursuit of its two overriding goals: maintain a high
quality, diverse and appropriately sized workforce to meet
the expectations of all clients and be among the global
companies most appreciated by its employees. With
95% of staff in daily contact with clients and consumers,
Sodexo is convinced that client and consumer satisfaction
depends on its teams’ skills and talent.

In April 2014, Sodexo conducted a new international
employee engagement survey among 130,000 employees
in 60 countries. The engagement rate, which measures
employees’ satisfaction and commitment, is a key
performance indicator.

The results of this latest survey show that significant
advances have been made:

e the employee engagement rate improved for the
third time running. At 59%, it was up two points on
Fiscal 2012 and 11 points from six years ago. The
participation rate was stable, at 68%, attesting to the
survey's credibility among employees;

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Fiscal 2014 Activity Report

e the main take-aways from the survey are that
Sodexo offers a stable, sustainable and fulfilling work
environment, with 86% of respondents stating
that they would rather work for Sodexo than for
a competitor. 80% of respondents are aware of the
career development opportunities available to them
and 88% consider that their working environment is
appropriate for the tupes of tasks they are asked to
perform

Sodexo was the first international group to participate
in the Best Emplouer certification program launched by
Aon Hewitt in 2014. This innovative program compares
organizations and identifies those that are marked by
effective leadership, a strong performance culture,
a compelling employer brand and high employee
engagement. The methodology used is based on Aon
Hewitt’s more than 20 years’ experience in the area of
employee engagement. Seventeen Sodexo countries,
representative of the Group's three activities, have already
obtained Best Employer certification

During the year, Sodexo also continued to invest in staff
training. As part of its commitment to offering employees
opportunities to acquire new skills and move up the career
ladder, Sodexo provided 5.1 million hours of training
during Fiscal 2014, an increase of 7% compared with
the prior year.

In addition, the Sodexo Academies offer Group employees
a wide range of training courses and development
opportunities. They include, for example, over 500 training
modules for employees working in facilities management
in the United States.

3.1.1.3 A GLOBAL EXPERT IN QUALITY
OF LIFE SERVICES

The Sodexo Quality of Life Institute conducts research
to deepen the Group's understanding of how quality
of life can drive individual and collective progress. The
Institute works with external stakeholders to identify the
Quality of Life levers that influence an organization's
performance in environments as diverse as businesses,
health care facilities, campuses, schools, remote sites and
correctional facilities

expert, in March 2014 Sodexo launched the Quality of Life
Observer, the first internet site to monitor and interpret
the components that contribute to quality of life. It
provides decision makers and opinion leaders with a global
panorama on quality of life, a decisive factor in individual
and collective performance, through shared experiences,
expert interviews, forums, analyses of university studies
and surveys. This unique production is enhanced through
media monitoring and is open to external contributions

currencies are as follows:

During Fiscal 2014, the Brazilian real declined 12.4%
against the euro. The U.S. dollar lost 3.9% and the UK
pound sterling gained 1.6%.

Continuing the method used since 2010 to translate
amounts in Venezuelan bolivars into euro and present
performance for the year, the consolidated financial
statements were prepared using an average exchange
rate of 51.06 bolivars = 1 U.S. dollar (equivalent to
67.34 bolivars = 1 euro). This rate is the one used for the
most recent transactions carried out by Sodexo (notably in
June 2014) on the new SICAD II foreign exchange platform

set up by the Venezuelan government in March 2014
This new rate used to translate income statement items
represented an 80% decline in the bolivar against the
euro in Fiscal 2014.

The effects of this decline (including on the consolidated
statement of financial position which is translated at the
closing exchange rate for the year) are presented in the
table below. The effect on profit attributable to equity
holders of the parent is just 2 million euro, which is not

Reflecting the application of this foreign currency exchange
rate, Group operations in Venezuela represented just 0.1%
of consolidated revenues and around 1% of consolidated
operating profit in Fiscal 2014.

3.1.2.2 REVENUE GROWTH

Sodexo’s consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2014 declined
by 2.1% to 18 billion euro. Organic growth was 2.3%.

Organic growth for the On-site Services activity was
1.8%. In a sluggish global economy, this increase reflects
stronger demand for Sodexo's integrated Quality of Life
Services offers in most regions. These well-configured
offers, which include a significant facilities management
component, helped to offset the decline in foodservices
volumes, particularly in Europe, that resulted from client
downsizing plans.

Organic growth in Benefits and Rewards Services
revenues was 13%. The significant acceleration compared
with Fiscal 2013 reflected the sustained growth dynamic
in Latin America and healthy expansion in Asia, led by
India and China

3.1.2.3, GROWTH IN OPERATING
PROFIT BEFORE EXCEPTIONAL
EXPENSES

Group operating profit before exceptional expenses was
966 million euro, an increase of 10.7% excluding currency
effects and 0.2% at current currency exchange rates over
the prior year.

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Fiscal 2014 Activity Report

The overall growth in operating profit included some
outstanding gains:

e 20.5% in On-site Services activity in the Rest of the
World region;

e 17.7% in On-site Services activity in Continental
Europe; and

e nearly 12% in Benefits and Rewards Services activity

At the same time, however, due to the significant start-
up costs incurred for large contracts, On-site Services
operating profit in North America and the United Kingdom
and \reland was more or less stable compared with the
prior year.

At the beginning of Fiscal 2013, Group senior
management launched a program to improve operational
efficiency and reduce costs. The objective of the program
was to reduce on-site operating costs and achieve
sustained administrative cost savings, with annual
savings increasingly affecting operating profit starting in
Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2015. In line with this time-scale,
Sodexo benefited from the initial positive effects of the
plan in Fiscal 2014, with cost savings of 100 million euro.

Consolidated operating margin therefore improved by
0.5 point, rising from 5.2% in Fiscal 2013 to 5.7% in
Fiscal 2014, excluding currency effects. Including currency
effects, consolidated operating margin was 5.4% at
current currency exchange rates

3.1.2.4 REPORTED OPERATING PROFIT

Reported operating profit amounted to 939 million euro,
an increase of 13.8% at current currency exchange rates
and 25.9% excluding currency effects

Sodexo - Registration Document Fiscal 2014 139

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Fiscal 2014 Activity Report

Exceptional expenses related to the program to improve
operational efficiency and reduce costs amounted to
27 million euro in Fiscal 2014. They included

e exceptional expenses which reduced gross margin
12 million euro related to asset impairments and the
cost of terminating certain under-performing contracts
or activities;

e exceptional expenses recorded in overheads: 15 million
euro related in particular to various cost-reduction
measures taken

The total costs incurred under the program to improve
operational efficiency and reduce costs during the
18-month period from September 2012 to February 2014
amounted to 166 million euro. The program is expected
to generate annual savings in the same amount in
Fiscal 2015, representing a 100% payback.

As part of the plan, Sodexo decided to terminate under-
performing contracts and activities representing annual
revenues of around 450 million euro.

Information related to operating profit in the remainder
of this section excludes these exceptional expenses.

3.1.2.5 NET FINANCING COSTS

Net financing costs increased to 173 million euro in
Fiscal 2014 from 136 million euro in Fiscal 2013

Net borrowing costs decreased by 11 million euro
compared with Fiscal 2013, following the refinancing
operations carried out since the beginning of Fiscal 2014
and the gradual reduction in borrowings.

The interest cost on defined benefit plan obligations
increased slightly. In addition, year-on-year comparisons
were unfavorably affected by the prior year proceeds from
the sale of financial investments, particularly equity
interests in project companies set up in connection with
Public-Private Partnership (PPP) contracts in the United
Kingdom, which reduced net financing costs by 28 million
euro in Fiscal 2013.

3.1.2.6 INCOME TAX EXPENSE

Income tax expense amounted to 265 million euro,
representing an effective tax rate of 34.8% as compared
to the prior year rate of 34.3%.

3.1.2.7 GROUP NET PROFIT
AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

Group net profit was 490 million euro compared to
439 million euro in the prior year, an increase of 11.6%
or 20.3% excluding currency effects.

Earnings per share was 3.23 euro compared to 2.91 euro
for the prior year, an increase of 11% or 19.6% excluding
currency effects.

The costs incurred in connection with the program to
improve operational efficiency and reduce costs had an
after-tax negative impact on Group net profit of 18 million
euro in Fiscal 2014 compared to 91 million euro in
Fiscal 2013.

3.1.2.8 PROPOSED DIVIDEND

At the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting to be held on
January 19, 2015, the Board of Directors will recommend
paying a dividend of 1.80 euro per share for Fiscal 2014,
an increase of 11.1% over the prior year. This proposal
is in line with Sodexo’s policy of allowing shareholders to
benefit from the increase in Group net profit; it also reflects
the Board’s great confidence in the Group's future and
takes into consideration Sodexo’s solid cash-generating
financial model. The proposed dividend represents a
payout ratio of 56% of Group net profit (54% of Group net
profit before exceptional expenses related to the program
to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs).

Shares held in registered form for more than four years
as of August 31, 2014 and still held when the dividend
becomes payable in February 2015, will qualify for a 10%
dividend premium, provided that they do not represent
over 0.5% of the capital per shareholder.

On-site Services revenues totaled 17.3 billion euro, a
decline of 2%. Organic growth was 1.8%.

Facilities management services now account for 28%
of consolidated revenues. As has been the case for the
last three fiscal years, revenues from these services
are continuing to grow more rapidly than foodservices
revenues (almost three times faster in Fiscal 2014),
providing renewed confirmation of the relevance of the

Group's strategic positioning

Fiscal 2014 organic growth in revenues on the same basis

of comparison was as follows by client segment

e 2.2% in Corporate, reflecting three contrasting trends

on the one hand, sustained demand in North
America, Europe and in emerging countries for
multi-services contracts with a significant technical
maintenance component,

on the other hand

- declining foodservices volumes in several
countries, particularly in Europe. Clients

continued to seek additional cost savings and
to downsize their workforces, while the effects
of reductions in consumer spending were felt,
particularly in France, the Netherlands, Italy
and Spain,

- asharp 4.5% decline in Remote Sites activity, in
particular in the mining sector, both worldwide
and more specifically in Africa, the Middle East,
Australia and Latin America
Excluding Remote Sites, Corporate segment
organic growth was around 4%;

e 1.1% in Health Care and Seniors, reflecting moderate
growth in On-site Services activity in both North
America and Europe. In addition, Sodexo decided not
to pursue the expansion of a new multi-site integrated
services contract in North America;

e 1.4% in Education, with a modest increase in the
number of consumers (universities and schools) in
North America, and solid growth in emerging countries
that benefit from Sodexo’s expertise in this segment.

The On-site Services activity’s key growth indicators
were as follows:

e a 93.4% client retention rate. This represented a
sharp improvement compared to the prior year, and
was in spite of Sodexo’s decision to terminate certain
under-performing contracts and the completion of
certain Remote Site projects. The rate was particularly
high in the United Kingdom and Ireland (at close to
97%) and it also improved in Continental Europe and
Latin America, as well as for the Remote Sites activity;

e 2.5% growth on existing sites, compared to 2.1% for
the prior year. The increase was mainly attributable
to improvements by Sodexo teams in reflecting the
effects of inflation in pricing both in Europe and in
Latin America, which offset continued decreases in
volumes in foodservices in Europe and the slowdown in
economic growth in certain emerging countries;

e a 7.1% business development rate (new contract
wins). The overall decline compared to 7.8% in

Fiscal 2013 masked improvements in Continental
Europe and China, as well as for the Remote Sites
activity, thanks to the many new integrated services
contracts sold during the year. The amount of new
contracts won during the fiscal year was 1.3 billion
euro in annual revenues

OPERATING PROFIT

On-site Services operating profit, excluding exceptional
expenses related to the program to improve operational
efficiency and reduce costs, amounted to 795 million euro
as compared to 764 million euro in Fiscal 2013.

The 8% increase at constant exchange rates was
generated primarily in Continental Europe and the Rest of
the World region and was partly due to the initial effects of
the program to improve operational efficiency and reduce
costs. On-site Services operating margin was 4.6% in
Fiscal 2014 compared to 4.3% in Fiscal 2013

On-site Services revenues in North America were 6.8 billion
euro. Organic growth for the year of 3.7% significantly
exceeded the 0.6% recorded in Fiscal 2013

At 8.9%, organic growth in the Corporate segment was
at its highest level since 2007, reflecting the success of
facilities management services offers for such clients as
Unilever, OneMain Financial/Citi Financial and The Boeing
Company, as well as the development of several major
Remote Sites in Canada, such as Suncor Fort Hills and
La Romaine 3

Sodexo won many new contracts during the fiscal year,
notably with Bloomberg and Dow Jones & Company

In Health Care and Seniors, the 1.1% revenue growth
was due to modest growth on sites, slower-than-expected
ramp-up of major contracts won in 2013 and the sale of
certain under-performing laundry activities. In addition,
following a change in the client's strategy, in the last
quarter of Fiscal 2014 Sodexo decided not to pursue the
ramp-up of the expanded contract for the ManorCare
national retirement home network and to revert to the
original contract scope consisting of services provided for
many years in the Northeastern United States.

Contract wins during the year included Covenant Care

(California) and Wheaton Franciscan Hospital (Wisconsin)
in the United States.

Organic growth in Education was 2.8%. The growth
dynamic was maintained thanks to a high client retention
rate and improved growth in On-site Services revenues in
the Schools and Universities segments linked to increases
in student spending and in the number of meals served

New contracts signed during the year included Chicago
Public Schools, Jackson State University (Mississippi) and
William Rainer Harper College (Illinois)

Continental Europe

Operating profit

On-site Services operating profit in North America totaled
358 million euro, an increase of 0.5% over the prior year
excluding currency effects.

Many productivity improvement initiatives were launched
as part of a structured program, leading in particular to
further advances in menu standardization and improved
management of overheads. However, these gains were
partially masked by the significant start-up costs incurred
notably for the ManorCare contract, and by a one-off
increase in provisions for impairment of certain trade
receivables

Operating margin was 5.3% compared to 5.5% in
Fiscal 2013.

In Continental Europe, revenues totaled 5.7 billion euro,
with organic growth representing a negative 0.2%

Performances were mixed, depending on the country
Sodexo continued to expand in Central Europe and
improved its performance in Germany and Belgium, but
experienced a further decline in foodservices volumes,
particularly in France and the Netherlands. In addition,
growth in Russia slowed considerably in the second half
of the fiscal year, as a result of the geopolitical situation

In Corporate, organic growth was 1.1%, reflecting the
continued success of integrated service offers with a
significant facilities management component, which were
sold to many clients throughout Europe. These services
enabled Sodexo to maintain its growth momentum and
to offset the decline in foodservices volumes that was due,
in particular, to client downsizing plans. Recent contract
wins included Carlsberg (for 35 sites in 10 countries, with
a wide range of services including cleaning, reception,
grounds keeping, foodservices, and technical maintenance

of buildings and fire protection systems), and Johnson &
Johnson in Germany.

In Health Care and Seniors, organic revenue growth in
Continental Europe was a negative 1.2%, reflecting weak
growth in On-site Services revenues due in particular to
shorter patient stays and erosion of the client retention
rate in Northern Europe over the twelve months of
Fiscal 2014. Recent contract wins included the Regional
Hospital in Saint Omer and the Clinique Générale in
Annecy, in France, and the Istituto Fisioterapici Ospitalieri
(IFO) in Italy.

In Education, the 3.6% decline in revenues was due to
Sodexo's decision to terminate or not to renew certain
under-performing contracts, notably in Southern
Europe, and to reductions in school budgets in several
countries. Sodexo’s teams nevertheless signed several
major contracts, for example with the public schools in
Asnieéres-sur-Seine in France and Taideyliopiston Sibelius
Akatemia in Finland

Operating profit

Operating profit from On-site Services in Continental
Europe rose by 33 million euro (or nearly 18% excluding
currency effects) to 231 million euro, and operating
margin improved significantly, to 4.1% from 3.5% in
Fiscal 2013. This performance was above all attributable
to effective management of overheads. It also reflected

the positive effects of several initiatives conducted as
part of the program to improve operational efficiency in
several European countries. In France, the crédit d'imp6ot
pour la compétitivité et l'emploi (CICE) recognized in
operating profit helped to offset the increase in payroll
taxes observed in recent years

In the Rest of the World (Latin America, Africa, Middle
East, Asia, Australia and Remote Sites), Sodexo reaffirmed
its leadership in high potential emerging markets
Revenues for the fiscal year amounted to 3.3 billion euro.
Unfavorable exchange rates reduced reported revenues by
369 million euro.

Excluding currency effects, revenues in the Rest of the
World region were stable, edging up 0.4%.

e Remote Site revenues (which accounted for 44% of
the total for the region) declined by more than 7%,
due to client delays in investing in new projects,
implementation of cost reduction programs by
mining sector clients and the large number of
projects completed over the past eighteen months
Sales momentum by Sodexo's teams in the energy
and infrastructure markets should drive a return to
growth in Fiscal 2015;

e Excluding Remote Sites, organic growth in the Rest of
the World region was 6.9%, with some regions such
as India and Southeast Asia recording double-digit
increases

Organic growth in the Corporate segment declined by
1.3% excluding currency effects. Services to companies
in the manufacturing and services sectors (excluding
Remote Sites) continued to grow at a satisfactory rate,

with revenues up 5.6% in emerging countries with strong
medium-term potential.

Sodexo's strong sales dynamic led to major contract
wins, such as BHP Billiton Cerro Matoso, and Unusis in
Colombia, Heineken in Brazil, Enel in Chile, Groote Eylandt
Gemco (BHP Billiton) and Woodside Energy in Australia,
Goodyear Tyres and Tetra Pak India in India, the Knesset
in Israel, Mondelez International in Peru and Shanghai
Mitsubishi Electric Ltd in China

In Health Care and Seniors, organic revenue growth of
17.1% reflected solid business development performance,
particularly in Brazil and Asia, with new contracts such
as Mater Dei Hospital (Belo Horizonte) in Brazil, Clinica
Universitaria Boliviariana in Colombia, American Sino
Medical Shanghai and the Beijing Jishuitan Hospital in
China. The sustained, steady pace of business growth is
the result of Sodexo’s globally-recognized expertise in the
Health Care and Seniors market.

In Education, Sodexo is also continuing to expand in
emerging markets, contributing its expertise and deep
familiarity with the various market segments to many
clients, especially in Southeast Asia and India. Organic
growth was 17.4%. Contract wins by Sodexo’s teams
included Panyapiwat Institute of Management in Thailand,
Fundacao Getulio Vargas in Brazil and Universidad Santo
Tomas in Chile.

Benefits and Rewards Services issue volume (face value
multiplied by the number of vouchers and cards issued)
totaled approximately 15.5 billion euro in Fiscal 2014 and
revenues from the activity amounted to 751 million euro.

Very strong underlying performances by the operating
teams, in terms of both growth and margins, were masked
by significant unfavorable currency effects, particularly
for Latin American currencies (see explanation at the
beginning of this section).

In Latin America, organic growth was very strong in
Fiscal 2014, with issue volume increasing by over 17% and
revenues by nearly 21%, in both cases excluding currency
effects. These impressive gains reflected the sustained
sales dynamic in Brazil, Chile and Venezuela, supported
by innovations closely aligned with client needs. Around
two-thirds of growth was due to market penetration and
cross-selling, while the other third resulted from inflation
in these countries

In Europe and Asia, organic growth in issue volume and
revenues was 4.1% and 2.5% respectively, reflecting
contract wins for Quality of Life Services, particularly in
the United Kingdom with Money Boost, in Turkey with the
offer for Ferrero, and in Central Europe. Organic growth
was also led by faster development in Asia, particularly
in India and China

Recent contract wins included Santander in Brazil with
22,000 beneficiaries of the Pass Cultura, Johnson

Controls in Romania, the Konak District, part of the Izmir
municipality in Turkey, the General Directorate of Customs
in the Czech Republic, Alcatel Lucent in Mexico, Fundacion
Escolar Del Estado Lara in Venezuela, Abbott Laboratories
in Mexico and Petrobras in Brazil

Operating profit

Benefits and Rewards Services operating profit increased
by nearly 12% (excluding currency effects) to 268 million
euro in Fiscal 2014, representing 25% of the Group's
consolidated operating profit.

The solid growth reflected the leverage provided by issue
volume growth and the cost efficiencies generated by tight
management of operating expenses. Sodexo’s Benefits
and Rewards Services solutions are now 63% digital,
following a gradual shift that has taken place over the past
ten years in the various countries. Sodexo is constantly
adapting to changes in payment media, while continuing
to invest to improve its client service performance and
better anticipate their future needs.

For Fiscal 2014, Benefits and Rewards Services operating
margin was 35.7% at current currency exchange rates
and 37.9% excluding currency effects, compared to
38.5% in the prior year. Margins were negatively affected
in Fiscal 2014 by the sharp decline in Latin American
currencies (Venezuelan bolivar and Brazilian real).

Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to
825 million euro, representing 200 million euro more than
in Fiscal 2013. Two factors explain the increase:

e the 119 million euro rise in operating profit of
consolidated companies, due notably to a low basis of
comparison in Fiscal 2013 when operating profit was
weakened by exceptional charges related to the cost
of implementing the program to improve operating
efficiency and reduce costs;

e asharp improvement in working capital requirement,
due mainly to an improvement in the timing of client
payments.

The net cash provided by operating activities was used
to finance:

e net capital expenditure and client investments of
287 million euro, representing 1.6% of revenues; and

e acquisitions for a total of 50 million euro, mainly
Créche Attitude in France (increase in control to

Small gains in the U.S. dollar and, above all, the UK pound
sterling, had a positive impact on several items in the
consolidated statement of financial position at August 31,
2014, such as goodwill. However, the increase in cash
and cash equivalents and non-current liabilities was
primarily due to the refinancing operations carried out
during the year.

Borrowings at August 31, 2014 amounted to 3,816 million
euro, a higher level than that as of August 31, 2013
(2,519 million euro). During the year, Sodexo carried out
two major debt refinancing operations:

e aprivate placement with U.S. investors in March 2014
for 1.1 billion U.S. dollars, structured in five tranches
with maturities ranging from 5 to 15 years and an
average interest rate of 3.8%; and

e a 1.1 billion euro bond issuance in June 2014,
comprising a 7.5-year tranche and a 12-year tranche,
at an average interest rate of 2.1%

These two operations enabled Sodexo to refinance
borrowings maturing in 2014 and 2015 at lower interest
rates, significantly extend the average maturity of its debt
and gradually reduce its average annual borrowing cost

Borrowings now mainly comprise two tranches of a
euro-denominated bond issue for 500 million euro
and 600 million euro respectively, an 880 million euro
bond issue maturing in January 2015 and three private
placements with U.S. investors for a total of 1,591 million
euro. The remaining balance includes various bank loans
and facilities, capital leases and derivative financial
instruments

Fiscal 2014 Activity Report

As of August 31, 2014, the average interest rate on
borrowings was 4.3%.

Cash and cash equivalents net of bank overdrafts
totaled 2,687 million euro at August 31, 2014. Cash
investments by the Benefits and Rewards Services
activity in instruments with maturities of over three
months increased to 343 million euro. Restricted cash
in the Benefits and Rewards Services activity totaled
415 million euro.

As of August 31, 2014, the operating cash position (which
includes Benefits and Rewards Services cash investments
and restricted cash) was 3,445 million euro, including
1,582 million euro for Benefits and Rewards Services.

Net debt at August 31, 2014 was 371 million euro,
representing 12% of consolidated equity compared to

as of the same date represented 5.4 years of operating
cash flow (4.1 years after including the reimbursement

Fiscal 2014 Activity Report

3.1.4 OUTLOOK

At the November 10, 2014 Board of Directors meeting,
Chief Executive Officer Michel Landel highlighted the
effectiveness of the Group’s long-term strategy, based
on a unique range of integrated Quality of Life Services,
an unparalleled global network in its activities, and
undisputed leadership in emerging countries

Michel Landel summarized three priorities for the Group
going forward in the coming years

e demonstrate the value of Sodexo’s offer in a rapidly
changing world, thanks to unique and differentiated
Quality of Life Services offerings in its three activities,
by showing how these services improve the daily life
of its customers and the performance of its clients;

e deliver the best of Sodexo across its international
network spanning 80 countries, using the Group's
deep-seated understanding of clients’ businesses, in
each client segment and sub-segment, and its unique
knowledge of the needs of the 75 million consumers
that it serves daily;

e strengthen Sodexo’s competitiveness, efficiency and
profitability, while continuing to deploy new standards
and adopt the best available processes.

In the context of a global economy shaped currently

by low inflation and an uncertain macro-economic and

political environment in certain emerging countries in the
short-term, Fiscal 2015 commences with three favorable
trends for Sodexo:

e |ncreasing demand for integrated services confirming
the relevance of the Group's offer;

e Continued sustained momentum and double-digit
growth in the Benefits and Rewards Services activity
in Latin America and Asia;

e A strong development rate (new contract wins) in
Remote Sites that should lead to a return to growth
in this activity in the first half of the fiscal year.

However, ramp-up of some of the more comprehensive
integrated service contracts is proving to take longer than
in the past.

Nonetheless, Michel Landel reaffirmed his confidence in
the Group's ability to achieve further operating leverage
and profitability improvement during Fiscal 2015,
thanks to the structured action plans implemented at
all levels of the organization to achieve the Fiscal 2015
objective; a program to improve operational efficiency
that is already delivering results; and, finally, the full
engagement of all Sodexo teams around initiatives to
improve competitiveness

Accordingly, for Fiscal 2015 Sodexo is targeting:

e organic growth in revenues of around 3%;

e an increase in operating profit of around 10%
excluding currency effects, representing an overall
improvement in operating margin of 0.8% over a two
year period excluding currency effects, in alignment
with the objectives set in November 2013.

In the medium-term, Sodexo is convinced that it can
capture an even greater share of its markets’ considerable
potential that is almost 50 times its current revenues and
also achieve lasting improvement in profitability

Further, Michel Landel noted that his Group Executive
Committee has been given the task of defining,
over the coming fiscal year, the necessary steps to
progressively move from an organization by country to an
organization by global client segment. This organizational
transformation will make it easier for Sodexo to give its
international and local clients the benefit of its expertise
and consumer insights in each of its markets.

He explained that by accelerating investment in
nontangible assets, in particular, by developing the
Group's human resources and strengthening technical
and innovation capabilities throughout the world, Sodexo
is continuing to focus its teams on the sustained drive to
improve competitiveness

Hence, the Group’s medium-term ambition (over the next
three to five years) is to achieve

e an annual average revenue growth rate (excluding
currency effects) of between 4% and 7%;

e an annual average growth in operating profit
(excluding currency effects) of between 8% and
10%; and

e@ an average annual cash conversion ratio of around
100%, allowing the Group to comfortably self-finance
its development.

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Fiscal 2014 Activity Report

Lastly, Michel Landel reaffirmed his strong confidence in
Sodexo’s future and reiterated its core strengths:

e the Group’s independence;

e a largely untapped potential market estimated at
nearly 50 times Sodexo’s current revenue;

e@ aunique range of Quality of Life Services particularly
well aligned with evolving client demand;

e an unparalleled global network in our services
spanning 80 countries;

e unchallenged leadership in emerging countries;

e a robust financial model that allows Sodexo to
self-finance its development;

e astrong culture and engaged teams.

In conclusion, Michel Landel added: “| would like to take
this opportunity to thank our clients for their loyalty, our
shareholders for their confidence and the Group’s 419,000
employees for their efforts in Fiscal 2014 and for their
daily commitment to improving the quality of life of our
clients and consumers”

> 1. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS

As explained in note 4.15 “Borrowings’ on March 4,
2014 the Group borrowed 1.1 billion U.S. dollars through
a private placement with U.S. investors (U.S. Private
Placement) structured in five tranches with maturities
of 5, 7, 10, 12, and 15 years. This borrowing was used
to refinance the Group’s 500 million euro bond issue
that matured on March 28, 2014. On June 24, 2014,
Sodexo SA completed a bond issuance structured in two
tranches: 600 million euro maturing in 7.5 years and
another tranche for 500 million euro maturing in 12 years,
for the purpose of refinancing the 880 million euro bond
issue maturing on January 30, 2015. The transactions
have significantly extended the maturity of the Group's
borrowings and will gradually reduce their cost.

> 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION OF
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2.1.1 Basis of preparation of financial
information for Fiscal 2014

Pursuant to European Regulation 1606/2002 of July 19,
2002, the consolidated financial statements of the
Sodexo Group have been prepared in accordance with
international financial reporting standards (IFRS) as issued
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
and approved by the European Union as of the period end.
Acomprehensive list of accounting standards adopted by
the European Union is available for consultation on the
European Commission website at http://ec.europa.eu/
internal_market/accounting/ias/index_en.htm

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

As explained in note 2.3.3.2 “Financial statements
denominated in foreign currencies; for the translation of the
financial statements of subsidiaries operating in Venezuela,
Sodexo uses a specific exchange rate corresponding to the
rate obtained for the most recent transactions in bolivars.
On March 24, 2014, the Venezuelan government created a
new foreign exchange platform called SICAD II (Alternative
Currencies Exchange System). On June 12, 2014,
Sodexo carried out its first transaction on this platform,
at an exchange rate of 52.10 bolivars = 1 U.S. dollar
(corresponding to 70.72 bolivars = 1 euro). To maintain
consistency with the translation method used since Fiscal
2010, the financial statements of subsidiaries operating
in Venezuela have been translated at the rate obtained for
the most recent transactions. This rate was 1 U.S. dollar =
51.06 bolivars (corresponding to 1 euro = 67.34 bolivars)
at August 31, 2014

Information for the comparative year presented has been
prepared using the same principles.

The IFRS application dates as approved by the European
Union are the same as those for the IFRS standards
published by the IASB during the past three years, except
for IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12, which are applicable
in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1,
2013 according to the IASB and in accounting periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2014 in the European
Union. The Group early-adopted these standards as
from September 1, 2013 (see note 2.1.3). Any difference
between the two sets of standards arising out of delays
in approval by the European Union had no impact on the
consolidated financial statements.

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

2.1.2 New accounting standards
and interpretations required
to be applied

The new standards, interpretations or amendments whose
application was mandatory for the Group effective for the
fiscal year beginning September 1, 2013 had no material
impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In particular, retrospective application of the revised IAS 19
“Employee Benefits, which notably requires the expected
return on defined benefit plan assets to be measured using
the discount rate applied to determine the defined benefit
obligation under these plans and the recognition as an
expense of certain costs related to the administrative
management of certain defined benefit plan funds, would
not have a material impact on the Fiscal 2013 income
statement. As a result, comparative information for Fiscal
2013 has not been restated to reflect the application of
this revised standard. Unrecognized past service costs in
the amount of 4 million euro were recognized by adjusting
shareholders’ equity as of August 31, 2012, net of tax.

Adoption of IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement; which was
applicable by the Group as from September 1, 2013,
had no material impact on the consolidated financial
statements.

2.1.3 Accounting standards
and interpretations issued
but not yet applicable

The Group elected to early adopt IFRS 10 “Consolidated
Financial Statements’ IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements”
and IFRS 12 “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ as
well as the amendments to IAS 27 “Separate Financial
Statements” and IAS 28 “Investments in Associates
and Joint Ventures”. Application of these standards and
amendments had no material impact on the consolidated
financial statements

The Group has not elected to early adopt any other
standards, interpretations or amendments not required
to be applied in Fiscal 2014.

The Group has not applied any IFRSs that had not yet been
approved by the European Union as of August 31, 2014

2.2 USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements requires the
management of Sodexo and its subsidiaries to make
estimates and assumptions which affect the amounts

reported for assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
as of the date of preparation of the financial statements,
and for revenues and expenses for the period

These estimates and evaluations are updated continuously
based on past experience and on various other factors
considered reasonable in view of current circumstances,
and are the basis for the assessments of the carrying
amount of assets and liabilities.

Actual results may differ substantially from these
estimates if assumptions or circumstances change.

Significant items subject to such estimates and
assumptions include the following

© impairment of current and non-current assets
(notes 4.10 to 4.12);

e fair value of derivative financial instruments
(note 4.16);

e provisions and litigation (notes 4.18 and 4.28);

e valuation of post-employment defined benefit plan
assets and liabilities (note 4.17);

e recognition of deferred tax assets (note 4.20);
e share-based payment (note 4.22);

e valuation of goodwill and intangible assets acquired
as part of a business combination, as well as their
estimated useful lives (note 4.23).

2.3. PRINCIPLES AND METHODS
OF CONSOLIDATION

2.3.1 Intragroup transactions

Intragroup transactions and balances, and unrealized
losses and gains between Group companies, are
eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the
same way as unrealized gains, unless they represent an
impairment loss.

2.3.2 Consolidation methods

A subsidiary is an entity directly or indirectly controlled
by Sodexo SA. The Group controls a subsidiary when it
is exposed, or has rights to obtain variable benefits from
its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability
to influence those benefits through its power over the
subsidiary. In determining whether control exists, voting
rights granted by equity instruments are taken into
account only when they give the Group substantive rights
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in

160 Sodexo - Registration Document Fiscal 2014


--- Page 30 ---

the consolidated financial statements from the date on
which control is obtained to the date on which control
ceases to be exercised.

Associates are companies in which Sodexo SA directly
or indirectly exercises significant influence over financial
and operating policy without exercising exclusive or joint
control. Joint ventures are joint arrangements in which
Sodexo SA directly or indirectly exercises joint control
and has rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
Associates and joint ventures are consolidated by the
equity method. Sodexo has a number of equity interests in
project companies established in connection with Public-
Private Partnership (PPP) contracts. These contracts
enable governments to call upon the private sector for the
design, construction, financing and management of public
infrastructure (hospitals, schools, barracks, prisons), with
detailed performance criteria. An analysis is performed
for each of these equity interests, in order to determine
whether they qualify as associates or joint ventures

Sodexo only makes equity and subordinated debt
investments in such projects when it acts as a service
provider to the project company

Further information on the main entities consolidated as
of August 31, 2014 is provided in note 6.

2.3.3 Foreign currency translation

The exchange rates used are derived from rates quoted on
the Paris Bourse and other major international financial
markets.

2.3.3.1 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the period end are translated using the
closing rate. The resulting translation differences are
reported in financial income or expense.

Non-monetary foreign-currency assets and liabilities
reported at historical cost are translated using the
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities reported at fair value are
translated using the exchange rate at the date when the
fair value was determined

Transactions for the period are translated at the exchange
rate at the transaction date.

Translation differences on monetary items that are
in substance part of a net investment in a foreign
operation consolidated by Sodexo are reported in other

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

comprehensive income until the disposal or liquidation
of the investment.

2.3.3.2 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DENOMINATED

IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Countries with stable currencies
The separate financial statements of each consolidated
entity are presented on the basis of the primary economic
environment (functional currency) in which the entity
operates

For consolidation purposes, all foreign-currency assets
and liabilities of consolidated entities are translated into
the reporting currency of the Sodexo Group (the euro) at
the closing exchange rate, and all income statement items
are translated at the average exchange rate for the period
The resulting translation differences are recognized in
other comprehensive income under “Currency translation
differences”. At the time of the transition to IFRS, the
cumulative translation adjustments recognized as of
September 1, 2004 were reclassified to consolidated
reserves.

Statutory monetary adjustments are maintained in the
financial statements of subsidiaries in countries that were
previously hyperinflationary (Argentina, Chile, Colombia,
Mexico and Turkey). The residual translation differences
between the monetary adjustment and the use of closing
exchange rates are reported in shareholders’ equity

Countries with hyperinflationary economies

For these countries, the difference between profit or loss
for the period translated at the average rate and profit
or loss for the period translated at the closing rate is
recognized in financial income or expense

Subsidiaries operating in Venezuela

At the end of calendar 2009, Venezuela joined the list of
countries considered hyperinflationary according to the
criteria in IAS 29. Consequently, with effect from the fiscal
year ended August 31, 2010, for the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements the Group has applied
the specific accounting requirements of this standard to
the transactions of its subsidiaries operating in Venezuela
that use the local currency as their functional currency

Effective from Fiscal 2010, the Group no longer uses
the official exchange rate published by the Venezuelan
government, and the financial statements of subsidiaries
operating in Venezuela are now translated at the actual
rate obtained for the most recent currency transactions
Accordingly, based on the rates obtained for a transaction

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

carried out in June 2014 on the SICAD II platform and other
transactions carried out in August 2014, the exchange
rates used are 1 U.S. dollar = 51.06 bolivars (1 euro =
67.34 bolivars) for the year ended August 31, 2014, and
1 U.S. dollar = 10.20 bolivars (1 euro = 13.50 bolivars)
for the year ended August 31, 2013

2.4 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
AND GOODWILL

The purchase method is used to account for acquisitions of
subsidiaries by the Group. Fair value of the consideration
corresponds to the fair value of assets acquired, equity
instruments issued by the purchaser and liabilities
assumed as of the date of the acquisition. Costs directly
related to the acquisition are expensed as incurred in the
income statement.

On initial consolidation of a subsidiary or equity interest,
the Group measures all identifiable elements acquired at
fair value at the acquisition date, in the currency of the
acquired entity.

Changes to the measurement of identifiable assets
and liabilities resulting from specialist evaluations or
additional analysis may be recognized as adjustments
to goodwill if they are identified within one year of the date
of acquisition and result from facts and circumstances
existing at the acquisition date. Once this one year period
has elapsed, the effect of any adjustments is recognized
directly in the income statement (unless it is the correction
of an error), including recognition of deferred tax assets
which are recognized in the income statement as a tax
benefit if more than one year after the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates and joint
ventures is included in the value of the equity method
investment.

2.4.1 Goodwill

2.4.1.1 ACQUISITIONS MADE

SINCE SEPTEMBER 1, 2009

Any residual difference between the fair value of the
consideration transferred (for example the amount paid),
increased by the amount of the non-controlling interest
in the acquired company (measured either at fair value
or its share in the fair value of the identifiable net assets
acquired) and the fair value as of the date of acquisition
of the acquired assets or liabilities assumed, is recognized
as goodwill in the statement of financial position

The Group measures non-controlling interests on a case-
by-case basis for each business combination either at fair
value or based on their percentage interest in the fair value
of identifiable net assets acquired

2.4.1.2 ACQUISITIONS MADE

BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 1, 2004

AND AUGUST 31, 2009
Any excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Group's
interest in the fair value at the acquisition date of the
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
has been recognized as goodwill in the statement of
financial position. Costs incurred and directly related to
the acquisition were included in the acquisition cost and
therefore in goodwill.

Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment
tests immediately if there are indicators of impairment,
and at least once per year. Impairment test procedures
are described in note 2.8. Goodwill impairment losses
recognized in the income statement are irreversible

2.4.2 Bargain purchases

When the fair value of the net assets acquired and the
liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date is greater
than acquisition cost, increased by the amount of any
non-controlling interest, the excess - representing negative
goodwill - is immediately recognized in the income
statement in the period of acquisition, after reviewing
the procedures for the identification and measurement
of the different components included in the calculation.

2.4.3 Transactions in non-controlling
interests

Changes in non-controlling interests, in the absence of
either assumption or loss of control, are recognized in
shareholders’ equity. In particular, when additional shares
in an entity already controlled by the Group are acquired,
the difference between the acquisition cost of the shares
and the share of net assets acquired is recognized in
equity attributable to equity holders of the parent. The
consolidated value of the assets and liabilities of the
subsidiary (including goodwill) remains unchanged

Prior to September 1, 2009, goodwill was recognized as
of the date of acquisition of non-controlling interests,
representing the excess of the cost of acquisition of the
shares over their carrying value as of the transaction date.

Sodexo - Registration Document Fiscal 2014


--- Page 32 ---

2.4.4 Adjustments and/or earn-outs

Since September 1, 2009, earn-outs related to business
combinations are recognized at their fair value as of
the date of acquisition even if they are considered to
be not probable. After the date of acquisition, changes
in estimates of the fair value of price adjustments
are adjusted to goodwill only if they occur within the
time period allowed (a maximum of one year as of the
date of acquisition) and if they result from facts and
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. In all
other cases, the change is recognized in profit and loss
except when the consideration transferred consists of an
equity instrument.

2.4.5 Step acquisitions

In a step acquisition, the fair value of the Group's previous
interest in the acquired entity is measured at the date that
control is obtained and is recognized in profit and loss. In
determining the amount of goodwill recognized, the fair
value of the consideration transferred (for example the
price paid) is increased by the fair value of the interest
previously held by the Group.

2.5 INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Separately acquired intangible assets are initially
measured at cost. Intangible assets acquired in connection
with a business combination and which can be reliably
measured, are controlled by the Group and are separable
or arise from a legal or contractual right, are recognized at
fair value separately from goodwill. Subsequent to initial
recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost less
accumulated amortization and impairment losses.

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Intangible assets other than certain trademarks having an
indefinite useful life are considered to have finite useful
lives, and are amortized by the straight-line method over
their expected useful lives

Integrated management software 3-7 years
Other software 3-5 years
Patents and licenses 2-10 years
Client relationships 3-20 years
Other intangible assets 3-20 years

Acquired trademarks with a finite useful life are generally
amortized over a period of less than ten years. Trademarks
that the Group considers as having an indefinite useful
life (notably based on criteria relating to their durability
and name recognition) are not amortized.

In view of the legal characteristics of French commercial
leases, lease rights are considered as having an indefinite
useful life and are not amortized

The cost of licenses and software recognized in the
statement of financial position comprises the costs
incurred in acquiring the software and bringing it into
use, and is amortized over the estimated useful life of
the asset.

Subsequent expenditures on intangible assets are
capitalized only if they increase the expected future
economic benefits associated with the asset to which
they relate. Other expenditures are expensed as incurred

2.6 PROPERTY, PLANT
AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, except
for land, which is measured at cost less accumulated
impairment losses. Cost includes expenditures directly
incurred to acquire the asset, and in some cases may
also include estimated unavoidable future dismantling,
removal and site remediation costs

Subsequent expenditures are included in the carrying
amount of the asset, or recognized as a separate
component, if it is probable that the future economic
benefits of the expenditures will flow to Sodexo and
the cost can be measured reliably. All other repair and
maintenance costs are recognized as expenses during the
period in which they are incurred, except costs incurred to
improve productivity or extend the useful life of an asset,
which are capitalized.

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated
over their expected useful lives using the component-
based approach, taking account of their residual value.
The straight-line method of depreciation is regarded as
the method that most closely reflects the expected pattern
of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied
in items of property, plant and equipment.

The useful lives generally used by the Group are

Buildings 20-30 years
General fixtures and fittings 3-10 years
Plant and machinery 3-8 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Boats and pontoons

(depending on the component) 5-15 years

The residual values and useful lives of items of property,
plant and equipment are reviewed and, if necessary,
adjusted at each period end

The carrying amounts of items of property, plant and
equipment are tested for impairment if there is an
indication that an item has become impaired

2.7 LEASES

Finance leases, under which substantially all the risks and
rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are transferred
to Sodexo, are accounted for as follows:

e at inception of the lease term, the leased asset is
recognized as an asset at the lower of fair value or
the present value of the minimum lease payments;

e the corresponding liability is recognized in borrowings;

e lease payments are apportioned between the finance
charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest
on the remaining balance of the liability.

An asset held under a finance lease is depreciated over its
estimated useful life, or if there is no reasonable certainty
that the lessee will obtain ownership by the end of the
lease term, over the shorter of the lease term and its
useful life.

Leases under which the lessor retains substantially all
the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset
are treated as operating leases. Payments made under
Operating leases are expensed as an operating item on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

2.8 IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS

2.8.1 Impairment of assets with finite
useful lives

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with
finite useful lives are tested for impairment if there is an
objective indication of impairment. Impairment losses are
recognized in the income statement, and may be reversed
subsequently.

2.8.2 Impairment of assets
with indefinite useful lives

Goodwill and other intangible assets considered to
have an indefinite useful life (such as trademarks) are
tested for impairment whenever there is an indication of
impairment, and at least annually, in the last quarter of
the fiscal year. The results of the impairment tests are
then confirmed using data as of August 31

2.8.2.1 CASH GENERATING UNITS

Assets that do not generate cash inflows that are largely
independent of those from other assets, and hence
cannot be tested for impairment individually, are grouped
together in Cash Generating Units (CGUs).

Impairment tests are performed at the level of the CGU
or group of CGUs corresponding to the lowest level at
which goodwill is monitored by the Group. This level
generally corresponds to one of the Group’s two main
operating segments, with the On-site Services activity
further segmented into geographic regions. Goodwill is not
tested for impairment at a higher level than the operating
segment (see note 3).

The assets allocated to each CGU or group of CGUs
comprise:

e goodwill, which is allocated when the CGU or group of
CGUs is likely to benefit from the business combination;

e other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment,
client investments and net working capital

2.8.2.2 INDICATIONS OF IMPAIRMENT

The main indicators that a CGU may be impaired are a
significant decrease in the CGU’s revenues and operating
profit or material changes in market trends.

164 Sodexo - Registration Document Fiscal 2014


--- Page 34 ---

2.8.2.3 METHODS USED TO DETERMINE

THE RECOVERABLE AMOUNT
An impairment loss is recognized in the income statement
when the carrying amount of an asset or CGU is greater
than its recoverable amount.

Recoverable amount is the greater of.

e fair value less costs to sell, 7.e. the amount obtainable
from the sale of an asset (net of selling costs) in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date; and

e value in use, which is the present value of the future

cash flows expected to be derived from continuing use
and ultimate disposal of the asset or CGU

The value in use of a CGU or group of CGUs is estimated
using after-tax cash flow projections generally based
on one- to three-year business plans prepared by
management and extrapolated to future years.

Management both at Group and subsidiary levels prepares
operating profit forecasts on the basis of past performance
and expected market trends. The growth rate used beyond
the initial period of the business plan reflects the growth
rate for the business sector and region involved.

Expected future cash flows are discounted at the average
cost of capital calculated for the Group. For certain CGUs
or groups of CGUs a premium is added to the average
cost of capital in order to reflect the greater risk factors
affecting certain countries

The growth and discount rates used for impairment tests
during the period are provided in note 4.10.

2.8.2.4 RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT LOSSES

An impairment loss recognized with respect to a CGU
is allocated initially to reducing the carrying amount of
any goodwill allocated to that CGU, and then to reducing
the carrying amount of the other assets of the CGU in
proportion to the carrying amount of each asset.

2.8.3 Reversal of impairment losses

Impairment losses recognized with respect to goodwill
cannot be reversed.

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Impairment losses recognized with respect to any other
asset may only be reversed if there is an indication
that the impairment loss is lower or no longer exists
The amount reversed is based on new estimates of the
recoverable amount.

The increased carrying amount of an asset resulting
from the reversal of an impairment loss cannot exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined
for that asset had no impairment loss been recognized

2.9 CLIENT INVESTMENTS

Some client contracts provide for a financial contribution
by Sodexo. For example, the Group may participate in
financing the purchase of equipment or fixtures on the
client site that are necessary to fulfill service obligations,
or it may make a financial contribution that will be
recovered over the life of the contract. These assets are
generally amortized over a period of less than 10 years,
but may be amortized over a longer period depending on
the contract duration. The amortization is recognized
as a reduction to revenues over the life of the contract.

In the cash flow statement, changes in the value of these
investments are presented as a component of investing
cash flows.

2.10 INVENTORIES

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net
realizable value. Cost is determined by the FIFO (First In
First Out) method.

2.11 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES

Trade and other receivables are initially recognized at
fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortized
cost less impairment losses recognized in the income
statement

Impairment is recognized when there is objective evidence
of the Group's inability to recover the full amount due
under the initial contract terms. The impairment
recognized represents the difference between the carrying
amount of the asset and the discounted future cash flow,
estimated using the initial effective interest rate. The
resulting impairment loss is recognized in the income
statement

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

2.12 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Financial assets and liabilities are recognized in the
statement of financial position on the transaction date,
which is the date when Sodexo becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

The fair values of financial assets and derivative
instruments are generally determined on the basis of
quoted market prices or of valuations carried out by the
depositary bank

2.12.1 Financial assets

Financial assets are measured and recognized in three
main categories

e available-for-sale financial assets include equity
investments in non-consolidated entities, marketable
securities with maturities greater than three months,
and restricted cash. They are measured at fair
value, with changes in fair value recognized in other
comprehensive income. When an available-for-sale
financial asset is sold or impaired, the cumulative fair
value adjustment recognized in other comprehensive
income is transferred to the income statement. For
securities listed on an active market, fair value is
considered to equal market value. If no active market
exists, fair value is generally determined based on
appropriate financial criteria for the specific security
If the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset
cannot be reliably measured, it is recognized at cost;

e loans and receivables include financial and security
deposits, and loans to non-consolidated equity
investees. These financial assets are recognized in
the statement of financial position at fair value and
subsequently at amortized cost, which is equivalent
to acquisition cost as no significant transaction costs
are incurred in acquiring such assets. They are tested
for impairment if there is an indication that they may
be impaired, and an impairment loss is recognized if
the carrying amount of the asset is greater than its
estimated recoverable amount;

e financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
include other financial assets held for trading and
acquired for the purpose of resale in the near term
Subsequent changes in the fair value of these assets
are recognized in financial income or expense in the
income statement.

2.12.2 Derivative financial instruments

Sodexo’s policy is to finance the majority of acquisition
costs insofar as possible in the currency of the acquired
entity, generally at fixed rates of interest.

Most of the Group's variable-rate borrowings are converted
to fixed-rate using interest rate swaps. In most cases
where borrowings are made in a currency other than that
of the acquired entity, currency swaps are contracted.

These derivative financial instruments are initially
recognized at fair value in the statement of financial
position. Subsequent changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments are recognized in the income statement,
except in the case of instruments that qualify as Cash
Flow Hedges.

For Cash Flow Hedges, the necessary documentation is
prepared at inception and updated at each period end
Gains or losses arising on the effective portion of the
hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income,
and are not recognized in the income statement until
the underlying asset or liability is realized. Gains or
losses arising on the ineffective portion of the hedge are
recognized in the income statement.

The fair value of these derivative instruments is generally
determined based on valuations provided by the bank
counter-parties

2.12.3 Commitments to purchase
non-controlling interests

As required by IAS 32, Sodexo recognizes commitments
to purchase non-controlling interests as a liability
within borrowings in the consolidated statement of
financial position. In the absence of any IFRS standard
or interpretation regarding the treatment of the related
debit entry, Sodexo has elected to offset the amount
involved against the relevant non-controlling interests in
shareholders’ equity until they are eliminated in full, and
to treat any surplus as goodwill

Firm commitments to purchase non-controlling interests,
which were all entered into prior to September 1, 2009,
are therefore accounted for as follows under IFRS:

e theliability arising from the commitment is recognized
in other borrowings at the present value of the purchase
commitment;

166 Sodexo - Registration Document Fiscal 2014


--- Page 36 ---

e the expected goodwill is recognized as an asset in the
consolidated statement of financial position;

e the change in value arising from the unwinding of the
discounting of the liability is recognized in the income
statement as a financial expense.

Subsequent price adjustments are recognized as
adjustments to the amount of goodwill for acquisitions
made prior to September 1, 2009.

2.12.4 Bank borrowings and bond issues

All borrowings, including bank credit facilities and
overdrafts, are initially recognized at the fair value of the
amount received less directly attributable transaction
costs.

Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are measured
at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The
effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated
future cash payments or receipts through the expected life
of a financial liability to the net carrying amount of that
liability. The calculation includes the effects of transaction
costs, and of differences between the issue proceeds (net
of transaction costs) and reimbursement value.

2.13 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents comprise current bank account
balances, cash on hand and short-term cash investments
in money-market instruments which either have an initial
maturity of less than three months at the moment of
purchase or may be withdrawn at any time at a known
cash value with no material risk of loss in value.

2.14 BORROWING COSTS

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of a qualifying non-current
asset are included in the cost of that asset. Borrowing
costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of a qualifying non-current
asset are recognized as an expense using the effective
interest method

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

2.15 SODEXO TREASURY SHARES

Sodexo shares held by Sodexo SA itself and/or by other
Group companies are shown as a reduction in consolidated
shareholders’ equity at their acquisition cost.

Gains and losses on acquisitions and disposals of
treasury shares are recognized directly in consolidated
shareholders’ equity and do not affect profit or loss for
the period

2.16 PROVISIONS

A provision is recognized if the Group has a legal or
constructive obligation at the period end and it is probable
that settlement of the obligation will require an outflow of
resources and the amount of the liability can be reliably
measured

Provisions primarily cover commercial, employee-related
and tax-related risks and litigation (other than those
related to income tax) arising in the course of operating
activities, and are measured using assumptions that take
account of the most likely outcomes.

Where the effect of the time value of money is material,
the amount of the provision is determined by discounting
the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value
of money and any risks specific to the liability

Loss-making contracts

A provision for onerous contracts is established where
the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under
a contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be
received under it.

2.17 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

2.17.1 Short-term benefits

Group employees receive short-term benefits such as
vacation pay, sick pay, bonuses and other benefits (other
than termination benefits), payable within 12 months of
the related service period.

These benefits are reported as current liabilities.

Sodexo - Registration Document Fiscal 2014 167


--- Page 37 ---

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

2.17.2 Post-employment benefits

Sodexo measures and recognizes post-employment
benefits as follows:

e contributions to defined-contribution plans are
recognized as an expense; and

e defined benefit plans are measured using actuarial
valuations.

Sodexo uses the projected unit credit method as the
actuarial method for measuring its post-employment
benefit obligations, on the basis of the national or
company-wide collective agreements effective within
each entity

Factors used in calculating the obligation include length
of service, life expectancy, salary inflation, staff turnover,
and macro-economic assumptions specific to countries in
which Sodexo operates (such as inflation rate and discount
rate).

Remeasurements of the net obligation under defined
benefit plans, including actuarial gains and losses,
differences between the return on plan assets and the
corresponding interest income recognized in the income
statement, and any changes in the effect of the asset
ceiling, are recognized in other comprehensive income
and have no impact on profit for the period

Plan amendments and the establishment of new
defined benefit plans result in past service costs that are
recognized immediately in the income statement.

The accounting treatment applied to defined benefit plans
is as follows

e the obligation, net of plan assets, is recognized as a
non-current liability in the consolidated statement of
financial position if the obligation exceeds the plan
assets;

e if the value of plan assets exceeds the obligation
under the plan, the net amount is recognized as a
non-current asset. Plan surpluses are recognized as
assets only if they represent future economic benefits
that will be available to Sodexo. Where the calculation
of the net obligation results in an asset for Sodexo,
the amount recognized for this asset may not exceed

the present value of all future refunds and reductions
in future contributions under the plan;

e the expense recognized in the income statement
comprises:

* current service cost, past service cost, if any, and
the effect of plan settlements, all of which are
recorded in operating income,

e the interest expense (income) on the net defined
benefit obligation (asset), calculated by multiplying
the obligation (asset) by the discount rate used
to measure the defined benefit obligation at the
beginning of the period

Sodexo contributes to multi-employer plans, primarily in
Sweden and the United States. These plans are accounted
for as defined contribution plans, as the information
provided by the plan administrators is insufficient for
them to be accounted for as defined benefit plans

2.17.3 Other long-term employee
benefits

Other long-term employee benefits are measured in
accordance with IAS 19. The expected cost of such benefits
is recognized as a non-current liability over the employee's
period of service. Actuarial gains and losses and past
service costs arising from plan amendments and the
establishment of new plans are recognized immediately
in the income statement

2.18 VOUCHERS PAYABLE

Vouchers payable are recognized as a current liability at
fair value, which is the face value of vouchers in circulation
or returned to Sodexo but not yet reimbursed to affiliates

2.19 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

Some Group employees receive compensation in the form
of share-based payment, for which payment is made in
equity instruments.

The services compensated by these plans are recognized
as an expense, with the offset recognized in shareholders’
equity, over the vesting period. The amount of expense

1 68 Sodexo - Registration Document Fiscal 2014


--- Page 38 ---

recognized in each period is determined by reference to
the fair value of the equity instruments granted, as of
the grant date

Each year, Sodexo reassesses the number of potentially
exercisable stock options that are expected to vest as
well as the number of shares that will likely be delivered
to beneficiaries of free shares based on the applicable
vesting conditions. The impact of any change in estimates
is recognized in the income statement, with the offset
recognized in shareholders’ equity

The features of the Group's share-based payment plans
are set out in note 4.22.

2.20 DEFERRED TAXES

Deferred taxes are recognized on temporary differences
between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and
its tax base, using the tax rate that is expected to apply
in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is
settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that are enacted
or substantially enacted at the period end

Deferred taxes are not recognized on the following items

e initial recognition of goodwill;

¢ initial recognition of an asset in a transaction that is
not a business combination and that affects neither
accounting profit nor taxable profit; and

e temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries
that are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable
future.

Taxes on items recognized directly in shareholders’
equity or in other comprehensive income are recognized
in shareholders’ equity or in other comprehensive income
and not in the income statement

Residual deferred tax assets on temporary differences
and tax loss carry-forwards (after offset of deferred
tax liabilities) are only recognized if their recovery is
considered probable.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a
legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and
liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable
entity and tax authority

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

2.21 TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES

Trade and other payables are measured at fair value on
initial recognition, and subsequently at amortized cost.

2.22 INCOME STATEMENT

2.22.1 Income statement by function
Sodexo presents its income statement by function
Operating profit comprises the following components

e gross profit;

e sales department costs;

e general and administrative costs; and

© other operating income and expense.

Other operating income and expenses include amortization
and impairment losses on client relationships and
trademarks, impairment losses on goodwill, and gains
and losses on disposals of property, plant and equipment,
intangible assets and consolidated subsidiaries

The Group’s share of the profits of companies consolidated
by the equity method is included in “Operating profit after
share of profit of companies consolidated by the equity
method that directly contribute to the Group’s business”
or below this line in “Profit for the period before tax”
depending on the nature of each of these companies’
activities

2.22.2 Revenues

Revenues reported by Sodexo relate to the sale of
services in connection with the ordinary activities of fully
consolidated companies as follows

e On-site Services: revenues include all revenues
stipulated in the contract, taking into account whether
Sodexo acts as principal (the vast majority of cases)
or agent;

e Benefits and Rewards Services: revenues include
commissions received from clients and affiliates,
financial income from the investment of cash
generated by the activity, and profits from vouchers
and cards not reimbursed

Sodexo - Registration Document Fiscal 2014

--- Page 39 ---

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Revenues are measured at the fair value of the
consideration received or to be received, net of discounts
and rebates as well as value added tax (VAT) and other
taxes, Revenues are recognized when it is probable that
future economic benefits will flow to Sodexo and these
benefits can be measured reliably. No income is recognized
if there is significant uncertainty about recoverability of
the costs incurred or to be incurred in meeting the service
obligation

Foodservices and other On-site Services revenues are
recognized when the service is rendered

Commissions received from clients in the Benefits and
Rewards Services activity are recognized when the
vouchers are issued and sent to the client or the cards
are credited. Commissions received from affiliates are
recognized when the vouchers are reimbursed or the
cards are used. Profits from unreimbursed vouchers and
cards are recognized based on their expiration date and
the deadline for presentation for reimbursement by the
affiliate.

2.22.3 Income tax expense

In connection with the introduction of the contribution
économique territoriale (CET - “Local Economic
Contribution”) under the 2010 Finance Bill in France,
which applies to French subsidiaries, Sodexo has elected
to recognize in income tax expense the portion of the
CET related to the cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des
entreprises (tax on corporate value added).

Tax credits that do not affect taxable profit and are
always refunded by the French government if they have
not been deducted from corporate income tax (including
the Competitiveness and Employment Tax Credit (CICE)
introduced in France under the third amended 2012
Finance Bill) are recognized as subsidies and therefore
reduce the expenses to which they relate

2.22.4 Program to improve operational
efficiency and reduce costs

In early Fiscal 2013, the Group launched a program to
improve its operational efficiency and reduce costs over
a period of around 18 months, in order to strengthen its

competitiveness. The expenses incurred in connection
with this program are presented under various operating
expense captions in the income statement depending
on the functions concerned. In the Group's segment
information they are presented in the “Unallocated”
column. They mainly relate to net contract termination
costs (including impairments of assets dedicated to the
contracts and any losses and provisions related to loss-
making contracts) and reorganization costs.

2.23 EARNINGS PER SHARE

Earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit for the
period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding during the period, net of treasury shares

In the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the
denominator is increased by the number of potentially
dilutive shares, and the numerator is adjusted for all
dividends and interest recognized in the period and any
other change in income or expenses that would result from
conversion of the potentially dilutive shares.

Potential ordinary shares are treated as dilutive if and only
if their conversion to shares would decrease earnings per
share or increase loss per share

A reconciliation between the weighted average number of
ordinary shares for the period and the weighted average
number of shares for the period adjusted for the effects
of potentially dilutive ordinary shares is presented in
note 4.4.

2.24 CASH FLOW STATEMENT

The cash flow statement analyzes changes in net cash and
cash equivalents, defined as cash and cash equivalents
less current bank overdrafts and credit bank balances
payable on demand that form an integral component of
treasury management

3. OPERATING SEGMENTS

The Group's activities are monitored by the chief operating
decision maker as follows: On-site Services and Benefits
and Rewards Services. The On-site Services activity is
further segmented by geographic region

Operating segments with similar economic characteristics,
including similar long-term average operating margins,
are aggregated in a single operating segment.

The On-site Services - Rest of the World segment
aggregates activities of three operating segments: On-site
Services - Latin America, On-site Services - Africa, Middle
East, Asia and Australia and On-site Services - China

These three operating segments aggregate countries and
regions located in emerging economies and therefore have
certain shared economic characteristics. In addition, none

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

The main assumptions used rely on the macro-economic
outlook for the geographic regions in which the CGUs or
groups of CGUs defined by Sodexo operate. They are
as follows (any impairment loss is recognized in other
operating expense):

Fiscal 2013
Discount Discount Long-term
rate rate? growth rate?)
8.2% 8.5%
to 11.2% 2% to 11% 2%
8.2% 2.5% 8.5% 2.5%
8.2% 2.3% 8.5% 2.419%
10.9% 4% 11% 4496 3
9.2% 3.3% 9.5% 3.3%
10.2% 3.6% 10.5% 3.6%

(1) The discount rate defined by the Group has been increased for certain regions in order to incorporate more significant risk factors affecting

certain countries.

(2) The long-term growth rate serves to extrapolate the terminal value based on data in the management plans.

Sensitivity analysis

Sodexo has analyzed the sensitivity of impairment test
results to different long-term growth rates and discount
rates.

The results of this sensitivity analusis indicated no
probable scenario where a change in the discount rate
or long-term growth rate would result in the recoverable
amount of a CGU or group of CGUs becoming less than
its carrying amount. In fact, the results of the impairment
testing demonstrate that even an increase of 200 basis
points in the discount rate or a reduction of 200 basis
points in the long-term growth rate would not result in

an impairment of the assets tested for any of the CGUs
or groups of CGUs tested.

The Group also performed a sensitivity analysis on the
operational assumptions used in order to determine
whether a 5% decrease in projected net cash flows
over the time period of the business plans prepared
by management and in terminal value would result in
the recognition of an impairment loss in the Group's
consolidated financial statements at August 31, 2014
The results of this analysis indicated no risk of impairment
for any of the CGUs or groups of CGUs

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN NON-CONSOLIDATED
COMPANIES

The Group holds an 18.50% interest in Bellon SA, the
parent company of Sodexo SA, carried at a value of
32.4 million euro. This available-for-sale financial asset is
an investment in a company that does not have a quoted
market price on an active market, and whose value cannot
be reliably measured. In addition, this investment is not
a liquid instrument. Consequently, it is carried at cost.
Any eventual decrease in the value of the Bellon SA shares
would be recognized as an impairment.

RESTRICTED CASH

Restricted cash of 415 million euro included in “Restricted
cash and financial assets related to the Benefits and
Rewards Services activity” primarily includes funds set
aside to comply with regulations governing the issuance
of service vouchers in France (258 million euro), India
(59 million euro) and Romania (36 million euro) and
Belgium (27 million euro). The funds remain the property
of Sodexo but are subject to restrictions on their use. They
may not be used for any purpose other than to reimburse
affiliates and must be kept separate from the Group's
unrestricted cash. Restricted cash is invested in interest-
bearing instruments.

4.14 STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Sodexo takes a long term view in managing its capital
structure, with the objective of ensuring the Group's
liquidity, optimizing its financial structure and allowing
shareholders to benefit from its strong cash flows.

Contributing to decisions made may be objectives for
earnings per share or estimated future cash flows, or
balancing various components of the consolidated
statement of financial position in order to meet the
net debt criteria defined by Group management and
communicated to the marketplace, notably a net debt to
equity ratio of less than 75%. Net financial debt is defined
as the difference between financial debt and total cash,

which is further defined as cash and cash equivalents plus
restricted cash and financial assets of the Benefits and
Rewards Services activity less bank overdrafts.

The Group holds 5,298,649 Sodexo shares (versus
5,620,453 as of August 31, 2013) with a carrying amount
of 318 million euro (309 million euro as of August 31,
2013) to cover its obligations under stock option and free
share plans for Group employees. These treasury shares
are deducted from shareholders’ equity at cost.

During the fiscal year, the Group purchased 74 million euro
of Sodexo SA shares in preparation for the future exercise

and depreciation) for the past 12 months;

e net assets adjusted for cumulative foreign exchange
translation gains or losses since August 31, 2007
must be not less than 1.3 billion euro.

If the covenants are not met, the lenders may, with a

qualified majority, require early reimbursement of these

borrowings.

4.17.1 Post-employment benefits

4.17.1.1 DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

Under a defined contribution plan, periodic contributions
are made to an external entity that is responsible for the
administrative and financial management of the plan
Under such a plan, the emplouer is relieved of any future
obligation (the external entity is responsible for paying
benefits to employees as they become due and the
employer is not required to make additional payments
related to prior or current years if the entity does not
have sufficient funds).

Contributions to defined contribution plans recognized in
operating expenses were 346 million euro for Fiscal 2014,
compared to 361 million euro for Fiscal 2013.

Contributions made by the Group are expensed in the
period to which they relate.

4.17.1.2 DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS

The characteristics of Sodexo’s principal defined benefit
plans are described below:

e in France, the obligation primarily represents lump-
sum benefits payable on retirement if the employee
is still with the Company at retirement age. These
obligations are covered by specific provisions in the
consolidated statement of financial position;

e inthe United Kingdom, Sodexo's obligation relates to a
complementary retirement plan funded by externally
held assets, and calculated on the basis of:

e for managers working in the private sector, a
percentage of final base salary,

e for managers working on public sector contracts,
benefits comparable to those offered in the public
sector,

e this plan was closed to new employees effective
July 1, 2003 and the level of contributions was
increased in order to cover the shortfall in the fund

Following the introduction of new regulations in the United
Kingdom, in October 2011 the Group elected to calculate
future indexation adjustments to the benefits payable by
Sodexo UK to certain members of its pension plan based
on the consumer price index (CPI) instead of the retail price
index (RPI) applied previously

The United Kingdom plan is regularly evaluated by the
plan’s actuary in compliance with UK law. A formal
actuarial evaluation by the plan’s actuary is required
to be conducted every three years, and any shortfall
identified at that time must be addressed through mutual
agreement between the plan’s trustees and Sodexo UK.
Following a consultation process with the members of the
pension plan carried out with a view to freezing benefit
accruals for certain members, an agreement was signed in
October 2012 between the plan’s trustees and Sodexo UK
whereby from November 1, 2012 the plan would remain
open only to employees who transferred to Sodexo UK
from the public sector, as Sodexo UK has a legal obligation
to pay them certain benefits. Sodexo UK also agreed to pay
annual contributions of 10 million pounds over the five
years from January 1, 2013 as part of the 12-year plan
to address the funding shortfall. Over the same period, it
is expected that the regular contributions made by Sodexo
UK will decrease given that only public sector members
will be able to obtain new benefits under the terms of the
agreement. Lastly, in October 2012, Sodexo SA issued a
parent company guarantee to the Trustee in order to cover
Sodexo UK's obligations in connection with the plan. This
guarantee is for up to 100 million pounds sterling for a
duration of 12 years.

In Continental Europe other than France, the main defined
benefit plans are as follows:

e in the Netherlands, certain employees are entitled
to complementary retirement or early retirement
benefits;

e in ltaly, there is a legal obligation to pay a lump-sum
retirement benefit (“TFR”). Until August 31, 2006, fully
vested employee rights were valued and discounted
as specified by law, and fully recognized as a liability

At the end of December 2006, the Italian parliament

approved a reform of the TFR system, implemented

into a defined contribution plan. For the period from
January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007, staff employed
as of December 31, 2006 were required to choose between
various defined-contribution plans, in connection with the
employee rights acquired on or after January 1, 2007. The
prior obligations remain on the consolidated statement

Actuarial losses arising from changes in financial assumptions amounted to 80 million euro, of which 52 million euro
related to plans in the United Kingdom and 16 million euro for plans in the Netherlands, the two countries that account
for most of the benefit obligation. These actuarial losses were mainly due to reductions in the discount rates applied.

The following assumptions were used for actuarial valuations for the principal countries as of August 31, 2014 and 2013:

Discount rate" 2% - 3% 2% 4% 1.25% - 1.50%
Salary inflation rate” 2.5% - 3% 2% 2.1% - 3.6% N/A

Net liability (in millions of euro) 75 50 60 29
Average term of the plans (in years) 10 22 22 6

(1) Discount rates in each country have been adapted to reflect the term of the plans. For the euro zone, the Group uses the iBoxx indices for
AA-rated corporate bonds. For the United Kingdom, the Group uses a discount rate based on a yield curve for high quality corporate bonds
drawn up by an external actuary.

(2) The salary inflation rate disclosed includes general inflation.

(3) Retail price index (RPI): 3.10%, consumer price index (CPI): 2.1%.

shares to Group employees free of consideration. Some of
these share grants are subject to performance conditions.
Options to purchase existing shares were also granted by
the Board of Directors to Group employees under various
stock option plans set up in prior years

4.22.1 Stock option plans
PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF STOCK OPTION PLANS

Rules governing stock option plans are as follows:

e stock options are generally granted at the same time
of the year and their exercise price has no discount;

e contractual life of options: 6-7 years;

e vesting of options is conditional on employment by
the Group and, for plans after 2007, on attainment of
average annual growth in Group net profit (excluding
currency effects) of at least 6% over a period of three
years. However, this performance condition applies
only to a portion (varying between O and 50%) of
the stock options granted to each beneficiary, with
the exception of the Chief Executive Officer, whose
entire grant is conditional on performance, with the
remaining options vesting in equal tranches over a
period of four years

ESTIMATION OF FAIR VALUE AT DATE OF GRANT

The fair value of options granted and settled by delivery
of equity instruments is estimated at the date of grant
using a binomial model, which takes into consideration

the terms and conditions of grant and assumptions about
exercise behavior.

The table below shows the data used in the valuation model for each plan measured under IFRS 2.

The expected life of the options is incorporated into
the binomial model based on option holders’ behavior
expected over the contractual life of the options and based
on historical data, and is not necessarily indicative of
future exercises.

The expected volatility is based on the assumption that
volatility calculated using regression analysis of daily
returns over the five- or six-year period (the expected
life of the options) prior to the date of grant, excluding
the share price fluctuations of September 2002, is an
indicator of future trends.

For plans granted as from 2008, the expected volatility
is based on a weighted average of the historical volatility
of the shares observed over periods corresponding to
the expected life of the options granted and the implicit
volatility expected in the marketplace.

The risk-free interest rate is the rate on Government
bonds (with reference to Iboxx rates in the euro zone) for
a maturity similar to the life of the options

4.22.2 Free share plans

PRINCIPLE FEATURES OF FREE SHARE PLANS
Rules governing free share plans are as follows:

e the shares will vest only if the beneficiary is still
working for the Group on the vesting date. In addition,
a performance condition applies to a certain proportion
of the grant (ranging from 0 to 50% depending on the
managers concerned, except for the Chief Executive
Officer who receives only performance shares);

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AT DATE OF GRANT

The fair value of free shares is estimated at the date
of grant based on the share price at that date after
deductions for dividends on the shares that will not be
paid to beneficiaries during the vesting period and a lock-
up discount for beneficiaries resident in France for tax
purposes. The lock-up discount is determined based on the

e for beneficiaries resident in France, the vesting period
is two years for shares not subject to any performance
condition and three years for performance shares,
subject in both cases to the beneficiary still working for
the Group on the vesting date. For beneficiaries resident
outside France, the vesting period is four years;

e free shares awarded to beneficiaries resident in France
for tax purposes are also subject to a two-year lock-up
period as from the vesting date.

of selling the shares forward for delivery at the end of the

120 million euro, compared to 136 million euro for

Performance bonds given to clients
Other commitments

TOTAL

Financial guarantees to third parties mainly comprise
bank subordinated debt commitments under Public-
Private Partnership (PPP) contracts (see note 2.3.2.)
totaling 10 million euro.

The performance bonds given to clients relate to around
twenty sub-contracting contracts where the Group
considers that it may be exposed to indemnity payments
if it is unable to fulfill the service obligation. These bonds
are subject to regular review by the management of the
business unit and a provision is recorded as soon as
payment under a bond becomes probable. For all other
contracts with a performance bond, Sodexo considers that
it would be capable of deploying the additional resources
needed to avoid paying compensation under the bond.

The 12-year leases signed on October 19, 2006
in connection with the relocation of the corporate
headquarters to Issy-les-Moulineaux in 2008 increased
operating lease commitments for office premises by
29 million euro. The leases and lease renewals signed
by Sodexo France and Sodexo, Inc. for their office
premises represent operating lease commitments of
24 million euro and 51 million euro respectively

The Group also has performance obligations to clients,
but regards these as having the essential features of a
performance guarantee rather than an insurance contract
designed to compensate the client in the event of non-
fulfillment of the service obligation (compensation is
generally due only where Sodexo is unable to provide
alternative or additional resources to fulfill the obligation
to the client).

In practice, given its size and geographical reach, Sodexo
considers itself capable of providing the additional
resources needed to avoid paying compensation to clients
protected by such clauses.

At this time, no provision has been recorded in the
consolidated statement of financial position with respect
to these guarantees.

The “Other commitments” line mainly includes the 12-
year guarantee for a maximum of 100 million pounds
sterling given by Sodexo SA in October 2012 to the
Trustee of the UK pension plan in order to cover Sodexo
UK’s obligations in connection with the plan

The Group also has commitments to provide training
hours to its employees in France, known as Individual
Training Rights. In the absence of guidance from
regulatory authorities on the accounting treatment
for these rights, the Group has opted to present these
rights as acommitment. Based on available information,
the number of hours to be provided to employees of
French subsidiaries is estimated to be approximately
2,806,000 hours.

Services subsidiary in the United Kingdom announced
that it had signed an agreement for the acquisition of
Motivcom plc. The acquisition should be completed before
the end of 2014

5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICY

5.1 EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK

Because Sodexo has operations in 80 countries, all
components of the financial statements are influenced
by foreign currency translation effects, and in particular
by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar. However, exchange rate
fluctuations do not generate any operational risk, because
each of the Group's subsidiaries invoices its revenues and
incurs its expenses in the same currency

Sodexo SA uses derivative instruments to manage the
Group’s exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange
rate risk.

5.1.1 Analysis of sensitivity to interest rates

(in millions of euro)

The policies approved by the Board of Directors, the
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer are
designed to prevent speculative positions. Further, under
these policies

e substantially all borrowings must be at fixed rates
of interest, or converted to fixed-rate using hedging
instruments;

e inthe context of financing policy, foreign exchange risk
on loans to subsidiaries must be hedged;

e the maturity of hedging instruments must not exceed
the maturity of the borrowings they hedge

As of August 31, 2014 and 2013, a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates would have had no material impact on
net profit before tax or on shareholders’ equity as substantially all liabilities at those dates were at a fixed rate of interest.

5.2 EXPOSURE TO LIQUIDITY RISK

The nature of the Group's borrowings and bond issuances
as of August 31, 2014 is described in detail in note 4.15
of the consolidated financial statements.

As of August 31, 2014, more than 94% of the Group's
consolidated borrowings was borrowed on capital markets
and bank financing was less than 6% of the Group's
financing needs. As of August 31, 2013 more than 90%
of the Group’s consolidated borrowings was borrowed
on capital markets and bank financing was less than
10% of the Group's financing needs. The reimbursement
maturity dates of the main borrowings range between
Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2029. The Group has a confirmed
multi-currency line of credit for 600 million euro plus
800 million U.S. dollars which expires in July 2018
This line of credit had been utilized in the amount of
215 million euro as of August 31, 2014 (250 million euro
as of August 31, 2013).

5.3. EXPOSURE TO

COUNTERPARTY RISK

Exposure to counterparty risk is limited to the carrying
value of financial assets

Group policy is to manage and spread counterparty risk.
For derivative financial instruments, each transaction
with a bank is required to be based on a master contract
modeled on the standard contract issued by the French

Bankers’ Association (AFB) or the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA).

Counterparty risk relating to customer accounts receivable
is immaterial. Due to the Group's geographic and segment
spread, there is no concentration of risk on past due
individual receivables for which no provision has been
recorded. Moreover, the Group has not observed any
significant change in impacts relating to customer default
during the year.

The main counterparty risk is bank-related. The Group has
limited its exposure to counterparty risk by diversifying
its investments and limiting the concentration of risk held
by each of its counterparties. Transactions are conducted
with highly creditworthy counterparties taking into
consideration country risk. The Group has instituted a
regular reporting of the risk spread between counterparties
and of their quality

To reduce this risk further, in Fiscal 2011 the Group
implemented an international cash pooling mechanism
between its main subsidiaries, reducing the amount of
liquidity held by third parties by concentrating it in the
Group's financial holding companies

The maximum counterparty is approximately 12% (14%
as of August 31, 2013) of the Group’s operating cash
(including restricted cash and financial assets of the
Benefits and Rewards Services activity) with a banking
group whose rating is Al.

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Statutory Auditors’ Report on the consolidated financial statements

3.4 Statutory Auditors’ Report on
the consolidated financial statements

This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors’ Report on the consolidated financial statements issued
in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English-speaking users.

The Statutory Auditors’ Report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified
or not. This information is presented below the audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes an
explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters.
These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account balances, transactions, or disclosures.

This report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the Group's Management
Report.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing
standards applicable in France.

SODEXO
255, quai de la Bataille-de-Stalingrad
92866 Issy-les-Moulineaux Cedex 9

For the year ended August 31, 2014
To the shareholders,

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your General Meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended
August 31, 2014, on

e the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Sodexo;
e the justification of our assessments;
e the specific verification required by law.

These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

| - OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of
selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the
financial position of the Group as at August 31, 2014 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Statutory Auditors’ Report on the consolidated financial statements

Il - JUSTIFICATION OF OUR ASSESSMENTS

In accordance with the requirements of article L.823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we bring to
your attention the following matters:

e the Company has tested goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life for impairment, and has assessed
whether assets with a finite useful life presented an indication of impairment, in accordance with the methods set out
in notes 2.8 and 4.10 to the consolidated financial statements

We have reviewed the methods used for the aforementioned tests, as well as the methodology applied to assess value
in use based on the present value of future cash flows, after tax. We have also reviewed the related documentation
which was prepared, the consistency of the data which was used and in particular the assumptions used in the
preparation of the business plans;

e the provisions for pension and other post-employment benefits as described in notes 2.17 and 4.17 to the consolidated
financial statements have chiefly been assessed by independent actuaries. We have reviewed the data and assumptions
used by these actuaries as well as their conclusions, and have verified that note 4.17 provides appropriate information

The aforementioned items are based on estimates and underlying assumptions which are uncertain by nature. As stated

in note 2.2 to the consolidated financial statements, actual results may differ materially from such estimates in different

conditions

These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and
therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.

Ill - SPECIFIC VERIFICATION

As required by law we have also verified, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the information
presented in the Group's Management Report.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements

Investments in progress as of August 31, 2014:

e post-balance sheet acquisitions of equity interests: as
of the date of this document, Sodexo has completed
no significant acquisition of equity interests since the
closing date;

e other firm commitments of acquisition of equity
interests: on September 12, 2014, the Group made
a firm commitment through its Benefits and Rewards
Services subsidiary in the United Kingdom to acquire
all of the shares of Motivcom plc for 41 million pounds
sterling

Because of the nature of the Group’s activities, investments
represent less than 2% of revenues and mainly relate

3.5.5 RISK FACTORS

3.5.5.1 RISKS RELATED TO
THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES

Commercial Risks related to On-site
Services

On-site Services contracts fall into two main categories
profit and loss and fee-based. The two categories are
differentiated by the level of commercial risk assumed
by the service provider.

In a profit and loss contract, the service provider is paid
for the service provided and bears the risks related to the
costs of providing the service. Profit and loss contracts
usually include periodic indexation clauses which allow for
price increases (such as labor or food costs) to be passed
on to clients, taking into account changes in economic
conditions. The absence of such contractual clauses could
have significant effect on the profitability of the related
contract

to investments on the Group's 32,700 sites, which are
used to support operating activities and are financed by
operating cash. None of these investments is individually
significant.

No significant acquisitions were made in Fiscal 2014

A detailed description of changes in investments is
provided in notes 3.1, 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 in the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Post-balance sheet acquisitions of equity interests are
described in note 4.29 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements

In a fee-based contract, the client bears all of the costs
incurred in providing the service, either directly or by
reimbursing the service provider, and regardless of the
patronage on site. The service provider is paid a fixed or
variable management fee. Sodexo’s purchasing expertise
ensures a stable supply of quality products at competitive
prices pursuant to agreements negotiated with suppliers
In certain specific cases, Sodexo is required to remit to
clients negotiated amounts received from suppliers

In practice, Sodexo’s contracts often combine features of
both of these contract types.

Client retention risk

Sodexo’s business depends on retaining and renewing
contracts with existing clients, and bidding successfully
for new contracts. This generally depends on various factors
including the quality, cost and suitability of its services,
and its ability to deliver competitive services that are

Sodexo - Registration Document Fiscal 2014 221


--- Page 91 ---

ISOLIDATED INFORMATION

Supplemental information

differentiated from those of the competitors. In Fiscal 2014,
the client retention rate for On-site Services was 93.4%

Competition risk

At the international level, Sodexo has relatively few
competitors

However, in every country where it operates, Sodexo faces
significant competition from international, national, and
sometimes local operators. In addition, some existing or
potential clients may opt to self-operate their On-site
Services rather than outsource them

The international, national and sometimes local operators
competing against Sodexo in On-site Services may be
companies offering a single tupe of service (such as
foodservices, cleaning or technical maintenance) or a
range of services. They may come from the foodservices
sector or other facilities management sectors or offer
other specialized technical services or even be companies
specializing in property management services which sub-
contract the services to various third parties.

In the 34 countries where Sodexo offers Benefits and
Rewards Services, it may be faced with competition from
asingle global competitor or from several regional or local
companies.

Dependency risk

Although business depends on Sodexo’s ability to
renew existing contracts and win new ones on favorable
economic terms, no single client represents more than
2% of total Group revenues

In addition, no industrial supplier represents more than
3% of the total volume of the Group’s purchases. However,
the Group’s ability to organize its supply systems,
including purchasing and logistics, significantly affects
its performance.

Sodexo's activities are not dependent on any patent or
licensed brand name of which Sodexo is not the legal
owner.

Food, services and workplace safety risk

Every day, Sodexo serves a vast number of consumers
worldwide, and it is committed to the safety of the food
and services provided.

In addition, workplace accidents may occur in foodservices
and in facilities management services.

In order to protect against shortcomings in this area,
Sodexo has implemented control procedures designed
to ensure strict compliance with applicable regulations,
sector standards and client requirements. Global food and
workplace safety policies are rolled out in all countries in
which the Group operates and include appropriate training
requirements for all employees.

However, if there were to be a significant incident at one
or more of the Group's sites, there could be impacts on
its activities, its profits and its reputation.

Risks related to food cost inflation
and access to food commodities

Sodexo could be exposed to fluctuations in food prices and
difficulties in the supply of certain products. The price of
food and its availability in the marketplace may vary in
different regions of the world.

Sodexo’s contracts include certain clauses allowing for
increases in prices or menu changes, but given the delays
in implementing such measures, a temporary reduction
in margins cannot be ruled out. Although most contracts
include a minimum annual increase in the pricing of
products and services provided by the Group, Sodexo could
be affected during inflationary periods if the contracted
increase rate is lower than the actual inflation rate.

Risks related to facilities management

Although facilities management services have long
been a part of the business, Sodexo’s strategy is to
accelerate the development of these services, resulting
in a larger contribution to revenue. These services require
skilled personnel, particularly in the areas of building
maintenance, electrical engineering, plumbing, heating
systems and air conditioning. Consequently, the Group

222 Sodexo - Registration Document Fiscal 2014


--- Page 92 ---

faces certain operational risks and has a need for qualified
human resources. The Group’s capacity to grow in this
highly specialized environment depends on its knowledge
of these markets and its ability to find, attract, recruit and
train suitable employees.

Risks related to acquisitions

Sodexo has acquired and may in the future acquire
businesses. These acquisitions will enhance earnings
only if Sodexo can successfully integrate the acquired
businesses into its management organization, purchasing
operations, distribution network and information
systems. The Group's ability to integrate acquired
businesses may be adversely affected by factors that
include failure to retain management and sales personnel,
the size of the acquired business and the allocation of
limited management resources among various integration
efforts. In addition, the benefits of synergies expected at
the time of selecting acquisition candidates may fall short
of those originally anticipated. Difficulties in integrating
acquired businesses, as well as liabilities or adverse
operating issues relating to acquired businesses, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition

As explained in note 4.10 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements, the Group performs annual
impairment tests on assets, including intangible assets
and goodwill recognized on business combinations. If the
carrying amount of these assets were to be less than
their recoverable amount, an impairment loss would be
recognized with an adverse effect on the Group's operating
results and financial condition

3.5.5.2 HUMAN RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT RISKS

Service quality is largely dependent on the ability to
attract, develop, motivate and retain the best talent,
and to provide a sufficient level of training in order to
raise standards continuously. For this reason, Sodexo
has developed training policies at every level of the
organization, with a particular focus on prevention and
safety.

The diversity of backgrounds, cultures and skills among
its people represents both a challenge and a major

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Supplemental information

opportunity. Sodexo is committed to capitalizing on this
diversity to gain a competitive edge and become a genuine
worldwide player, so that its people - at every level - reflect
the diversity of the Group’s clients and consumers

Sodexo senior management is currently working on
transforming the organizational structure of the On-
site Services activity. This reorganization is intended to
permit improved alignment with the needs of our clients
and consumers, to accelerate growth and to enhance
efficiency. The design and subsequent progressive
implementation of such a reorganization will require an
important investment of management time and attention
Any significant diversion of management resources could
be disruptive and impact the Group's ongoing business
and operating results. Accordingly, Sodexo’s Group
Executive Committee and Board of Directors have put in
place governance to closely monitor and mitigate this risk.

As far as it is aware Sodexo is not exposed to any specific
Jabor-related risk other than those arising in the ordinary
course of business for an international group of its size.

3.5.5.3 ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS

Sodexo is aware of the potential environmental impact of
its activities, even though it operates on its clients’ sites
Rather than underestimate its importance, the Group
makes every effort to manage and limit environmental
risk.

The environmental impact of its activities arises mainly
from

e consumption of water and energy in foodservices
facilities, food preparation and cleaning;

e production of waste from food preparation and
cleaning (packaging, organic matter, waste fats and
oils, and waste water from cleaning);

e climate change leading to exceptional weather incidents
having an impact on the cost of commodities

As part of its role as a corporate citizen, Sodexo launched
The Better Tomorrow Plan in 2009. This continuous
improvement plan identifies 18 commitments of which
eight focus on the environment.

ISOLIDATED INFORMATION

Supplemental information

3.5.5.4 RISKS ASSOCIATED
WITH TECHNOLOGY

The Group is increasingly dependent on information
technology infrastructure and applications in its
activities. The main risks are related to the availability of
information technology services, data security and data
privacy. Any failure in infrastructure, application or data
communication or breakdown in security, as well as any
loss in data, whether accidental or intentional, as well as
the use of data by third parties, could inhibit the Group’s
ability to serve its clients, delay decision-making, and in
general have a negative effect on the Group’s activities.

3.5.5.5 REGULATORY RISK

The nature of Sodexo’s business and its worldwide
presence mean that it is subject to a wide variety of
Jaws and regulations including labor law, antitrust law,
corporate law, anti-corruption law, and health, safety and
environmental law.

Sodexo has the legal structures in place at the appropriate
Tevels to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations.

Certain services in the Benefits and Rewards Services
activity benefit from favorable tax treatment in certain
countries. These tax incentives may be adjusted to varying
degrees by the governments concerned. A change in the
related laws or regulations could have a direct impact
on Sodexo’s business, either by creating opportunities
or by posing a threat to existing services. As such, if tax
incentives were to be reduced or abolished, this could
lead to a significant reduction in issue volume for some
of the services concerned. However, Sodexo offers more
than 250 different services in 34 countries and therefore
considers that this risk is largely dispersed.

3.5.5.6 LIQUIDITY, INTEREST RATE,
FOREIGN EXCHANGE
AND COUNTER-PARTY RISK

Sodexo has access to a wide variety of bank funding
sources in addition to raising funds directly from investors

on the commercial paper and bond markets. Because
it has operations in 80 countries, all components of
the financial statements are inevitably influenced by
foreign currency translation effects, and in particular by
fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, the British pound Sterling,
the Swedish crown, the Brazilian real, and the Venezuelan
Bolivar Fuerte. However, exchange rate fluctuations do not
generate operational risk, because each subsidiary bills its
revenues and incurs its expenses in the same currency

Sodexo uses derivative instruments to manage its
exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.

Additional information about these risks is provided
in notes 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 to the consolidated financial
statements.

3.5.5.7 ECONOMIC DOWNTURN RISK

Adverse economic conditions could affect the Group's
operations and earnings. The weight of national debt
and continued unemployment could lead to significant
pressures on economic activity both in the public and
private sectors, leading to a decline in demand for the
services Sodexo offers its clients - in particular in the
Corporate segment - and thus have a negative impact
on operations

Nonetheless, Sodexo’s clients are predominantly (around
two-thirds of annual revenues) in less cyclical sectors such
as Education, Healthcare, Justice and Defense

The Remote sites activity is dependent on the petroleum
and mining industries. Lastly, unfavorable economic
conditions could result in a lengthening of payment times
or impair the solvency of Sodexo’s clients. Conversely,
the economic situation could lead clients to increase
outsourcing in order to achieve cost savings.

3.5.5.8 LITIGATION RISK

Refer to note 4.28 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements for information on these risks.

3.5.6 RISK COVERAGE

3.5.6.1 INSURANCE COVER

Sodexo’s general policy is to transfer non-retained risks,
especially intensity risks'”, to the insurance market.
Insurance programs are contracted with reputable
insurers.

The main insurance programs are as follows

e Jiability insurance, which covers against personal
injury, property damage or consequential loss caused
to third parties. This category notably includes
operational, product, after-delivery and professional
liability insurance. The amounts insured depend on
the nature of Sodexo's activities, the country where
it operates, and the extent of cover available in the
insurance market;

e property insurance, which mainly covers the risk of fire
and explosion, water damage, natural disasters, and
(in some countries) acts of terrorism. As a general rule,
the sum insured is equal to the value of the insured
property; however, some insurance contracts cap the
amount paid out under the policy;

e workers’ compensation. In countries with no
government-provided coverage (primarily the
United States, Canada and Australia), Sodexo has
contracted workers’ compensation programs

The cover provided under these programs complies with
the relevant legal requirements in each country

CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION

Supplemental information

3.5.6.2 DEDUCTIBLES

Retained or self-insured risks correspond to the deductibles
specified in the insurance programs contracted by
Sodexo. They consist for the most part of frequency
risks (i.e. risks that recur regularly) but from time to time
may also include intensity risks (i.e. risks representing
substantial amounts). In some countries, these retained
risks correspond to deductibles under employer's liability,
workers compensation, third-party automobile and
property insurance

In North America, deductibles range from 5,000 U.S
dollars to 5,000,000 U.S. dollars per occurrence and
some of the corresponding self-insured risks have been
managed by a captive insurance company since June 1,
2006. Outside North America, deductibles generally range
from 7,500 euro to 2,000,000 euro per occurrence.

3.5.6.3 PLACING OF RISK AND
TOTAL COST

On the occasion of its most recent policy renewals, Sodexo
maintained the scope and level of its coverage, as regards
in particular, general liability insurance and professional
liability insurance, especially for risks associated with
facilities management activities.

The total cost of the main insurance programs and
self-insured risks (excluding workers’ compensation) of
fully-consolidated Group companies is approximately
45 million euro, representing less than 0.25% of
consolidated revenue
