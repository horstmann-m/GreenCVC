Revenues

Net revenues for the year 2018 of PartnerRe were 4,694 million, a decrease of €322 million compared to the year
2017 (€5,016 million), principally due to a net increase in realized and unrealized investment losses (€642 million),
partially offset by an increase in net premiums earned (€220 million).

Net revenues for the year 2018 of FCA (excluding Magneti Marelli) were €110,412 million with higher shipments,
positive pricing and favorable mix, principally in NAFTA.

Net revenues for 2018 of Ferrari increased to €3,420 million (€3,417 million in 2017), thanks to the combination of a
€79 million increase in cars and spare parts, a €12 million increase in sponsorship, commercial and brand and a
€1 million increase in other net revenues, partially offset by a €89 million decrease in engines sales.

Revenues for the year 2018 of CNH industrial Group were €25,179 million, an increase of €452 million compared to
the year 2017. This increase was primarily due to an improvement in net revenues of Industrial Activities.

Net Profit (loss

Net loss of PartnerRe was driven by Catastrophic losses related to Typhoons Jebi and Trami, Hurricanes and
Michael, and California wildfires and net realized and unrealized investment losses on fixed maturities and short-
terms investments, partially offset by net foreign exchange gains.

In 2018 FCA net profit was €3,632 million, of which €8,330 million from continuing operations (€3,291 million in
2017). The increase in the net profit from continuing operations (+€22 million) was mainly driven by lower tax and
net financial expenses, improved NAFTA and LATAM operating performance, net of lower results in APAC,
Maserati and EMEA. Net profit from continuing operations was also affected by a provision of €748 million
recognized for costs and related to final settlements reached on civil, environmental and consumer claims related
to U.S. diesel emissions matters.

Net profit of CNH Industrial in 2018 amounted €1,185 million compared to €422 million in 2017 and included a gain
of €446 million related to the modification of a healthcare plan in the U.S.

transactions with Group companies, dispose of certain assets or merge with or into other companies and use
assets as security for other transactions. Further, certain bond issues and bank borrowings provide for compliance

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (APM)

To facilitate understanding of the economic and financial performance of EXOR and of the Group, the Management
of EXOR has identified a number of Alternative Performance Measures (APM) which are used to identify
operational trends and to make investment and resource allocation decisions. To ensure that the APM are correctly
interpreted it is emphasized that these measures are not indicative of the future performance of the Group. The
APM are not part of international reporting standards (IFRS) and are unaudited. They should not be taken as
replacements of the measures required under the reference financial reporting standards.

The APM should be read together with the consolidated financial information prepared using the shortened
consolidation criterion. APM used by EXOR, since they are not based on the reference financial reporting
standards, may not be consistent with those used by other companies or groups and therefore may not be
comparable. The APM used by EXOR have been computed consistently in terms of definition and presentation in
all the reporting periods for which financial information is presented in this Report.

It should also be noted that the principal subsidiaries and affiliates make use of non-GAAP financial measures to
illustrate their performance to the market. Such indicators are commonly used by analysts and investors in the
sectors to which the subsidiaries belong to evaluate business performance. A description of the manner in which
such indicators are computed is provided by the individual subsidiary companies and these are included in the
section Review of performance of the Operating Subsidiaries in the Board Report, as extracted from their
respective published documents. Such information is prepared autonomously by the companies and is not
homogeneous.

Set out below are the main APM'’s identified by EXOR:

= Net Asset Value
= Net Financial position
= Share of the profit (loss) of investments accounted for using the equity method.

Net Asset Value (NAV)

Net Asset Value (NAV) corresponds to the total value of assets net of the Gross Debt of the Holdings System as
defined below. In determining the total value of assets at 31 December 2018, listed equity investments and other
securities are valued at official market trading prices, unlisted equity investments are valued at fair value,
determined annually by independent experts, and unlisted other investments (funds and similar instruments) are
valued by reference to the most recent available fair value. Bonds held to maturity are valued at amortized cost.
Treasury stock includes shares held in treasury before the Share Buyback Program launched on
14 November 2018. Treasury shares are valued at the official stock exchange price, except for the part designated
to service stock option plans (measured at the option exercise price under the plan if this is less than the stock
exchange price).

The sum of the aforesaid values constitutes the total value of assets (Gross Asset Value). Gross Debt corresponds
to the total amount of the financial debt of the Holdings System.

Items included in the calculation of Gross Asset Value and Gross Debt which are denominated in foreign
currencies are converted at the official exchange rates at the corresponding reporting date.

At 31 December 2018, EXOR’s NAV is $19,740 million (€17,238 million) compared to $22,972 million
(€19,155 million) at 31 December 2017.

At 31 December 2018 EXOR’s NAV per share amounts to $82.33 or €71.89 compared to $95.32 (€79.48) at
31 December 2017), a decrease of $13/share or -13.6%.

Net financial position of the Holdings System

The net financial position of the Holdings System, determined by applying the shortened consolidation criterion,
provides the best presentation of the financial resources and commitments directly attributable to and managed by
EXOR.

Using the shortened consolidation criterion adopted by EXOR rather than the line-by-line method of consolidation
required by law and under IFRS, the data derived from the financial statements or accounting data prepared in
accordance with IFRS by EXOR and by the subsidiaries constituting the Holdings System - Exor Nederland N.V.
(the Netherlands), EXOR S.A. (Luxembourg), Exor Investments Limited (United Kingdom), Exor Investment (UK)
LLP (United Kingdom), Ancom USA Inc. (USA), Exor SN LLC (USA) - are consolidated in the financial statements
of the parent company EXOR using the line-by-line method while the data derived from the financial statements or
accounting data prepared in accordance with IFRS of the operating subsidiaries and associates (PartnerRe,
Ferrari, CNH Industrial, Juventus Football Club, The Economist Group and Welltec) are included in the
consolidated financial statements of the parent company EXOR using the equity method. The financial community
is familiar with this information which facilitates analysis of the financial position and results of EXOR.

Nevertheless, such data do not fully represent, nor should be treated as the consolidated financial position of the
EXOR Group prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In fact, the
shortened consolidation method is not contemplated in the reference accounting standards on the presentation of
consolidated financial statements and may not be consistent with the method adopted by other groups and,
therefore, such data may not be comparable with the data reported by such groups. The consolidated data
prepared in shortened form are not audited by the independent auditors.

REVIEW OF THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
OF THE EXOR GROUP — SHORTENED

This section presents EXOR Group results using the “shortened” method of consolidation.

The Holding system companies are consolidated line-by-line and the operating subsidiaries and
associates are consolidated using the equity method.

While such data is not contemplated in the reference accounting standards, EXOR believes that
this information facilitates the analysis of the financial position and the results of EXOR.

REVIEW OF THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF THE EXOR GROUP - SHORTENED

As described above in the APM section, EXOR applies a shortened consolidation criterion to facilitate the analysis
of the financial position and results of EXOR.

Using the shortened consolidation criterion rather than the line-by-line method of consolidation required by law and
under IFRS, the data derived from the financial statements or accounting data prepared in accordance with IFRS
by EXOR and by the subsidiaries constituting the Holdings System are consolidated in the financial statements of
the parent company EXOR using the line-by-line method, while the data derived from the financial statements or
accounting data prepared in accordance with IFRS of the operating subsidiaries (PartnerRe, FCA, Ferrari, CNH
Industrial, Juventus Football Club) and associates (The Economist Group and Welltec) are included in the
consolidated financial statements of the parent company EXOR using the equity method.

The following table shows the shortened consolidation area:

EXOR closed the year 2018 with a consolidated profit of €1,347 million; the year 2017 ended with a consolidated
profit of €1,392 million. The decrease of €45 million is attributable to the lower net financial income of €78 million
and other negative changes of €32 million, partially offset by the decrease in impairments (€65 million).

The consolidated net financial position of the Holdings System at 31 December 2018 is a negative €3,255 million
and reflects a negative change of €91 million compared to the negative financial position of €3,164 million at
31 December 2017. Additional details are provided in Note 8.

At 31 December 2018 the consolidated equity attributable to owners of the parent amounts to €12,210 million with
a net increase of €1,405 million compared to €10,805 million at 31 December 2017. Additional details are provided
in Note 9.

Following the retrospective adoption on 1 January 2018 of IFRS 9 — Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 —Revenue
from Contracts with Customers EXOR recognized the accumulated transitional effects in retained earnings on the
date of initial application.

EXOR has not restated consolidated shortened data as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, but has
quantified the effects attributable to FCA and CNH Industrial on the statement of financial position. The adoption of
the standards generated a net reduction in EXOR’s equity and in investments accounted for using the equity
method of €33 million at 1 January 2018. Additional details are provided in Note 6.

The positive change in EXOR’s investment in PartnerRe is mainly due to the positive translation exchange
differences (€201 million) and remeasurement of defined benefit plans reserve (€21 million), partially offset by
EXOR’s share of the loss for the year (€105 million) and the payment of dividends (€41 million).

The positive change in EXOR’s investment in FCA (€1,077 million) is mainly attributable to EXOR’s share of
the profit (€1,046 million) and the positive remeasurement of defined benefit plans reserve (€70 million).

The positive change in EXOR’s investment in Ferrari (€136 million) is primarily due to the EXOR’s positive
share of the profit (€186 million), partially offset by the payment of dividends (€31 million) and the buy- back of
treasury stock (€24 million).

The positive change in EXOR’s investment in CNH Industrial (€268 million) can be ascribed primarily to
EXOR’s share of the profit (€314 million) and the positive remeasurement of defined benefit plans reserve
(€34 million), partially offset by the payment of dividends (€51 million), the negative translation exchange
differences (€24 million) and the buy-back of treasury stock (€36 million).

Investments measured at fair value

The investments measured at fair value amount to €65 million (€48 million at 31 December 2017) and include
principally investments in equity instruments. The positive change (€7 million) is mainly due to new
investments (€18 million) partially offset by the negative fair value adjustment (€7 million) and the disposal of
minor investments (4 million).

Net financial position of the Holdings System

The net financial position of the Holdings System at 31 December 2018 is a negative €3,255 million and

Financial assets include principally financial instrument accounted for at FVTPL and debt securities listed on

an active market measured at amortized cost.

Financial receivables include the receivable arising from the divestment of Banca Leonardo (€8 million),

completed in April 2018.

Cash and cash equivalents include short-term deposits, money market instruments and bonds. Investments
are spread over an appropriate number of counterparties chosen according to their creditworthiness and their

reliability since the primary objective is to hold investments which can readily be converted into cash.

Originally €250 million; the amount was increased by another €200 million in 10 May 2016. The issue price corresponds to the weighted average of the
prices calculated on the entire amount of €450 million.

EXOR intends to repay the bonds in cash at maturity using available liquid resources and undrawn credit lines.

EXOR may from time to time buy back bonds on the market also for purposes of their cancellation. Such
buybacks, if made, depend upon market conditions, EXOR’s financial situation and other factors which could
affect such decisions.

The bank debt decrease of €685 million is mainly attributable to the repayment of credit lines, of which
€254 million in foreign currency ($300 million, related to the acquisition of PartnerRe).

At 31 December 2018 the amount of commercial paper outstanding is €230 million compares to a maximum

amount of €500 million established by the EXOR Euro-Commercial Paper Program on 15 May 2018.

Other financial liabilities (€26 million) mainly consist of the measurement of cash flow hedge derivative

instruments.

Data presented and commented below are derived from PartnerRe’s consolidated financial information for the year
ended 31 December 2018 prepared in accordance with US GAAP.

(a) The Company uses a combined ratio to measure results for the Non-life P&C and Specialty segments. The combined ratio is the sum of the technical and
other expense ratios.

(b) The Company uses allocated underwriting result as a measure of underwriting performance for its Life and Health segment. This metric is defined as net
premiums earned, other income or loss and allocated net investment income less life policy benefits, acquisition costs and other expenses.

(c) Net income/loss attributable to PartnerRe common shareholders is defined as net income/loss attributable to PartnerRe less preferred dividends.

(d) Net income ROE is calculated as net income return on average common shareholders’ equity.

(e) Effective 1 July 2018 the executive management responsibility and reporting for U.S. Health business was reallocated from the Life and Health segment to the
P&C segment as part of an internal organizational change, comparatives have been updated accordingly.

Underwriting result

Net premiums written for the full year 2018 increased to $5.8 billion compared to $5.1 billion in 2017. The increase
was primarily due to an increase in Non-Life net premiums written, driven by a 15% increase in the Property and
Casualty (P&C) segment and 5% increase in the Specialty segment, as well as a 25% increase in the Life & Health
segment. The increase in Life & Health was primarily driven by organic growth and the inclusion of the Aurigen
Capital Ltd (Aurigen) life premiums for a full year in 2018 compared to three quarters in 2017, following the
acquisition on 2 April 2017.

The Non-life combined ratio of 101.9% for the full year 2018 (102.3% in 2017) was driven by Catastrophic losses of
$386 million related to Typhoons Jebi and Trami, Hurricanes Florence and Michael, and California wildfires. These
events contributed 9.0 points on the combined ratio in 2018, compared to 14.1 points on the combined ratio in 2017
from losses related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria (HIM), and California wildfires of $569 million, net of
retrocession and reinstatement premiums.

The Non-life underwriting loss also reflects improvement in attritional losses on the current accident year compared
to 2017 and $29 million of other income related to a gain on a commutation transaction of a reserve and
reinsurance agreement with Colisee Re during the fourth quarter of 2018. The Non-life combined ratio continued to
benefit from net favorable prior year development of $249 million (5.8 points) in 2018 compared to $448 million
(11.1 points) for 2017, with both the P&C and Specialty segments experiencing net favorable development.

The Life and Health allocated underwriting result was a gain of $86 million for the full year 2018 compared to a gain
of $68 million in 2017, driven by increased profitability and organic growth, including in the acquired Aurigen
operation, partially offset by $7 million higher expenses to support the Company’s plan to grow the business.

Net investment return for 2018 was $37 million, or 0.1%, which included net investment income of $416 million and
interest in earnings of equity method investments of $11 million, partially offset by net realized and unrealized
investment losses of $390 million. This compares to a net investment return of $720 million, or 4.2%, for 2017,
which included net investment income of $402 million, net realized and unrealized investment gains of $232 million,
and interest in earnings of equity method investments of $86 million.

Investments

Net realized and unrealized investment losses of $390 million for the full year 2018 were driven by increases in
U.S. risk-free rates and the widening of U.S. and European investment grade corporate spreads. This compares to
net realized and unrealized investment gains of $232 million for 2017 which were driven by compression in
corporate bond spreads and strong performance in public and private equities, partially offset by the impact of
increases in U.S. risk-free rates.

As of 31 December 2018, reinvestment rates were 3.2% compared to the Company’s fixed income investment
portfolio yield of 2.9% for the fourth quarter of 2018.

Other Income Statement items

Other expenses of $306 million (expense ratio of 5.5%) for the full year 2018 were down $42 million, or 12%,
compared to $348 million (expense ratio of 6.9%) for 2017. These decreases were primarily due to lower recurring
personnel costs driven by a decrease in full-time equivalent employees as a result of efficiency actions undertaken
by the Company, in addition to lower reorganization costs, consulting and facilities costs, partially offset by higher
expenses primarily in the Life and Health segment to support the Company's plans to grow the business. The full
year 2017 also included $4 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Aurigen.

Review of Net income (loss)

Net loss attributable to common shareholder was $132 million for 2018 which was driven by losses related to
Typhoons Jebi and Trami, Hurricanes Florence and Michael, and California wildfires of $386 million and net
realized and unrealized investment losses on fixed maturities and short-term investments of $376 million, partially
offset by net foreign exchange gains of $119 million. This compared to net income of $218 million for 2017, which
included losses related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and California wildfires of $569 million, net realized
and unrealized investment gains on fixed maturities and short-term investments of $153 million and net foreign
exchange losses of $108 million.

Preferred shares, aggregate liquidation value 704 704 0
Common shareholders’ equity 5,812 6,041 (229)
Total Capital 7,929 8,193 (264)

Total capital of $7.9 billion at 31 December 2018, down 3.2% compared to 31 December 2017, primarily due to the
net loss for 2018, dividends on preferred and common shares, the impact of the foreign currency translation
adjustment and a decrease in Euro debt from foreign exchange movements.

Debt decreased by $36 million primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange on the Company’s Euro
denominated debt.

Common shareholder's equity (or book value) of $5.8 billion and tangible book value of $5.2 billion at
31 December 2018 both decreased by 3.8% compared to 31 December 2017, primarily due to the net loss for
2018, dividends on common shares and the foreign currency translation adjustment. Book value, excluding
dividends on common shares for 2018, was $5.9 billion at 31 December 2018, down 3.0% compared to
31 December 2017. Dividends declared and paid by PartnerRe to EXOR Nederland N.V. were $48 million for the
full year 2018.

Total investments and cash and cash equivalents were $16.3 billion at 31 December 2018, down 1.6% compared
to 31 December 2017. The funds held—directly managed account of $0.4 billion and related guaranteed reserves of
$0.4 billion as of 31 December 2017 were settled upon commutation of the related business in the fourth quarter of
2018.

Cash and cash equivalents and fixed maturities and short-term investments, which are government issued or
investment grade fixed income securities, were $13.5 billion at 31 December 2018, representing 83% of the cash
and cash equivalents and total investments.

The average credit rating and expected average duration of the fixed income portfolio at 31 December 2018 was A
and 3.9 years, respectively, while the average duration of the Company’s liabilities was 4.8 years.

Reconciliation of reported US GAAP financial information to IFRS financial information used for line-by-line
consolidation purposes

The differences between the US GAAP net loss ($132 million) and the IFRS net loss ($124 million) are immaterial
and related only to the economic effects of the application of the acquisition method by EXOR to account for the
acquisition.

2019 Outlook

Excluding the impacts of any significant catastrophe and other large losses and/or increases in interest rates or
credit spreads, PartnerRe expects to continue to generate positive underwriting and investing returns. PartnerRe,
and some of its peers within the reinsurance industry, do not provide earnings guidance given its reinsurance
results are largely exposed to low frequency and high severity risk events. Some of these risk events are seasonal,
such that results for certain periods may include unusually low loss experience, while results for other periods may
include modest or significant catastrophe losses. In addition, PartnerRe’s investment results are exposed to
changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and capital markets in general, which result from fluctuations in general
economic and financial market conditions. As a result, PartnerRe’s profitability in any one period or year is not
necessarily predictive or indicative of future profitability or performance.

NAFTA

Higher Net revenues primarily due to positive effects from volumes and net pricing, partially offset by negative
foreign currency translation effects. Adjusted EBIT increase due to positive net pricing, favorable mix and higher
volumes, partially offset by increased product content and launch costs related to new vehicles.

LATAM

Net revenues up slightly primarily due to higher shipments, mix and net pricing, partially offset by negative foreign
exchange translation effects and weakening Argentine peso. Adjusted EBIT increase mainly as a result of higher
volumes, favorable mix and positive net pricing, partially offset by negative foreign exchange effects and higher
industrial and advertising costs related to new vehicles.

APAC

Net revenues decrease due to unfavorable mix, pricing actions and foreign currency translation effects. Decrease
in Adjusted EBIT primarily due to lower net revenues and lower results from China JV, as well as the benefit of the
Tianjin port explosions final insurance recovery of €93 million included in prior year results

EMEA

Net revenues flat, with favorable mix offset by lower volumes and negative net pricing. Adjusted EBIT decrease
primarily due to negative net pricing, lower volumes and impacts from the transition to WLTP car type approval
particularly in the second half of the year, as well as higher advertising to support Jeep brand growth, partially
offset by industrial cost savings.

Maserati

Net revenues decrease primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable market mix. Adjusted EBIT decrease
primarily due to lower volumes, increased depreciation and amortization unfavorable FX, partially offset by lower
marketing expense.

Net industrial cash (debt)

(2) Refer to specific section below.

Shipments

Shipments totaled 9,251 units in the year 2018 with an increase of 853 units (+10.2%) compared to the prior year.
This achievement was driven by a 19.6% increase in sales of the 12-cylinder models (V12), while the 8-cylinder
models (V8) grew by 7.3%. The V12 performance was mainly led by the 812 Superfast, partially offset by lower
sales of La Ferrari Aperta that finished its limited series run. V8 performance was led by the ramp up of the Ferrari
Portofino as well as the newly launched special series 488 Pista.

Net revenues
Net revenues for 2018 increased by a few million to €3,420 million (+0.1% at current currency and +3.2% at
constant currency compared to the prior year.

Revenues in Cars and spare parts were €2.535 million (+3.2% at current currency or +6.9% at constant currency
compared to prior year), supported by higher volumes led by the 812 Superfast, as well as the ramp up of the
Ferrari Portofino and the 488 Pista. Additionally, pricing and personalization programs positively contributed along
with deliveries of the Ferrari J50 and first deliveries of the FXX K EVO, which was partially offset by lower sales of
LaFerrari Aperta.

The erosion in Engines revenues (€284 million, -23.8% at current currency and constant currency) reflected lower
shipments to Maserati.

Sponsorship, commercial and brand revenues (€506 million, +2.4% at current currency or 5.3% at constant
currency) were up thanks to stronger revenues from sponsorship as well as a higher 2017 championship ranking
compared to 2016, partially offset by lower sales generated by other brand related activities.

EBIT

EBIT for 2018 was €826 million, an increase of €51 million, (+6.6%), from €775 million for 2017; the increase in
EBIT was primarily attributable to the combined effects of positive volume impact (€118 million): a positive
contribution from other supporting activities of €26 million, a decrease in research and development costs of
€14 million and in selling, general and administrative costs of €2 million, partially offset by a negative product mix of
€17 million and negative foreign currency exchange impact of €92 million (including foreign currency hedging
instruments) primarily driven by fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar, the Pound Sterling and the Japanese Yen compared
to the Euro).

The positive volume impact of €118 million was attributable to an increase in total shipments, driven by the 812
Superfast, the Ferrari Portofino and the 488 Pista. The negative product mix of €17 million was primarily
attributable to the combined impact of lower sales of LaFerrari Aperta and the strong performance of the Ferrari
Portofino, partially offset by the 812 Superfast, as well as pricing increases and deliveries of the strictly limited-
edition Ferrari J50 and the FXX K EVO. The positive contribution from other supporting activities of €26 million was
primarily attributable to sponsorship activities, a higher 2017 championship ranking compared to 2016 and a
favorable ruling on a prior year’s legal dispute, partially offset by a lower contribution from other brand related
activities and engines supplied to Maserati.

Net industrial debt

Revenues

Revenues in the year 2018 were $29.736 million, an increase of 7.6% (up 8.5% on a constant currency basis)
compared to 2017, primarily due to an improvement in net revenues in each segment of Industrial Activities which
were $27,927 million in 2018, an increase of 8.4% (up 9.1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior
year.

Net revenues for Agricultural Equipment were $11,786 million in 2018, a 10.3% increase (up 13.5% on a constant
currency basis) compared to 2017. The increase was driven by a sustained price realization performance, coupled
with a stabilization of end-user demand in most of our markets, including emerging evidence of a replacement
cycle in the row crop sector in North America. For 2018, worldwide agricultural equipment industry unit sales
increased 3%. In North America, industry volumes in the over 140 h.p. tractor market sector were up 5% and
combines were up 10%. Industry volumes for under 140 h.p. tractors were up 6%. EMEA markets were down 8%
for tractors and up 4% for combines. LATAM tractor industry volumes decreased 1% and combine industry
volumes increased 10%. APAC markets increased 3% for tractors and 2% for combines.

Net revenues for Construction Equipment were $3,021 million in 2018, a 19.4% increase (up 20.2% on a constant
currency basis) compared to 2017, primarily due to increased end-user demand in all regions and favorable net
price realization. In 2018, Construction Equipment’s worldwide heavy industry volumes were up 20% and light
industry volumes were up 17% compared to 2017. Overall industry volumes increased in all regions.

Commercial Vehicles net revenues were $10,933 million in 2018, an increase of 3.5% compared to 2017 (up 2.4%
on a constant currency basis), as a result of positive pricing and a favorable product mix.

Powertrain net revenues were $4,557 million in 2018, an increase of 4.3% (up 2.8% on a constant currency basis)
compared to 2017, due to higher sales volume in engine applications. Sales to external customers accounted for
50% of total net revenues (48% in 2017).

Financial Services reported net revenues of $1,996 million in 2018, a 1.6% decrease (up 1.7% on a constant
currency basis) compared to 2017, primarily due to a lower average portfolio balance in North America.

our regions. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 2.6 p.p. to 9.3%. The Company continues to invest in its product
development program for precision farming and compliance with Stage V emissions requirements.

Adjusted EBIT of Construction Equipment was $69 million in 2018, a $120 million increase compared to 2017.
Adjusted EBIT margin increased 4.3 p.p. to 2.3%. The increase was due to higher sales volume, favorable mix and
positive net price realization, more than offsetting raw material cost increases, mainly in North America.

Adjusted EBIT of Commercial Vehicles was $285 million in 2018, a 57.5% increase compared to 2017, mainly due
to a favorable product mix in light duty trucks and buses, and to the focus on sales of alternative propulsion
solutions in heavy duty trucks. Positive price realization in trucks and manufacturing efficiencies also contributed to
the improved results. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 0.9 p.p. to 2.6%.

Adjusted EBIT of Powertrain was $385 million in 2018, a $23 million increase compared to $362 million in 2017.
The improvement was mainly due to a favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by
higher product development spending. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 0.1 p.p. to 8.4% compared to 2017.

Net industrial debt

Net industrial debt at 31 December 2018 was $640 million compared to $1,023 million at 31 December 2017. The
decrease was primarily due to a significant cash generation from operating activities of $0.6 billion and to positive
foreign exchange translation impacts on euro denominated debt, partially offset by dividend payments and by
purchase of treasury shares.

and 31 December 2017, respectively.

2019 Outlook (US GAAP)"

The performance achieved in 2018 confirms CNH Industrial on track with a profitable growth trajectory, despite a
softer macroeconomic and business environment in the second part of the year, caused by escalating trade
tensions and related tariffs across global markets, other economic and political uncertainties (including those
concerning the outcome of the Brexit negotiations), and a general expectation of a slowdown in global economic
growth. In addition, the emerging megatrends in the industries where CNH Industrial competes, such as
digitalization, automation, and electrification, entail a re-assessment of the go to market approach and of the capital
investment requirements in new technologies for new products and customer solutions. Subject to this evolving
scenario, CNH Industrial is defining 2019 guidance as follows:

- Net sales of Industrial Activities at approximately $28 billion

- Adjusted diluted EPS” up between 5% and 10% to previous year at a range of $0.84 to $0.88 per share

- Net industrial debt at the end of 2019 between $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion, with investments in research and
development expected to increase over 5% and in capital expenditures by over 25% compared to 2018, with a
growing portion of this spend to support development on key megatrends (digitalization, electrification,
automation and servitization) and engine regulatory capital investments.

(1) 2019 guidance does not include any impacts deriving from the gain resulting from the modification of the healthcare plan in the U.S. previously mentioned and
anticipated on April 16, 2018, as this gain has been considered non-recurring and therefore treated as an adjusting item for the purpose of the adjusted
diluted EPS calculation. In addition, 2019 guidance does not include any impacts deriving from possible further repurchases of Company's shares under the
plan authorized by the AGM on 13 April 2018.

(2) Outlook is not provided on diluted EPS, the most comparable GAAP financial measure of this non-GAAP financial measure, as the income or expense
excluded from the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS and instead included in the calculation of diluted EPS are, by definition, not predictable and uncertain

JUDENTUS

(63.77% of share capital)

The results for the first half of the financial year 2018/2019 of Juventus Football Club S.p.A. are as follow:

| Half
€million 2018/2019 2017/2018 Change
Revenues 330 291 39
Operating costs (227) (179) (48)
Operating income 17 51 (34)
Profit for the period 7 43 (36)
€million 31/12/2018 31/12/2017 Change
Shareholders' equity 80 137 (57)
Net financial debt 384 280 104

For a correct interpretation of the data it should be noted that the financial year of Juventus does not coincide with the calendar year but runs the period 1 July —
30 June, which corresponds to the football season. The accounting data under examination thus represents the first half of operations for the financial year
2018/2019.

Interim data prepared only for EXOR consolidated reporting purpose and cannot be construed as representing the basis for a Juventus full-year projection.

Profit performance is characterized by the highly seasonal nature typical of the sector, determined mainly by the calendar of football events and the two phases of
the players’ Transfer Campaign.

The financial position and cash flows of the company are also affected by the seasonal nature of the income components; in addition, some revenue items are
collected in a period different from the period to which they refer.

The first half of the 2018/2019 financial year closed with a profit of €7 million, posting a negative change of
€36 million compared to the profit of €43 million registered in the same period of the prior year.

The negative change was mainly due to lower revenues from players’ registration rights, down €18 million,
increased costs for players and staff for €38 million, higher amortization and depreciation on players’ rights for
€25 million, increased costs for the acquisition of materials intended for sale for €6 million, increased other
expenses for €3 million, increased costs for external services for €3 million and increased in other costs for
3 million. These changes were partially offset by increased operating revenues, €57 million, and lower expenses
from players' registration rights, down €& million. Other negative changes of €1 million concerned principally
increased provisions.

2019 Outlook
The 2018/2019 financial year of Juventus, currently forecast to end in a loss, will be as usual strongly influenced by
the performance of sports results and in particular the UEFA Champions League.

2019 Outlook
EXOR N.V. does not prepare budgets or business plans nor does it publish forecast data or data on the basis of
which it is possible to calculate forecast data.

Certain EXOR operating subsidiaries (FCA, Ferrari and CNH Industrial) publish forecast data on their performance.
Other operating subsidiaries (PartnerRe and Juventus Football Club) publish information on the foreseeable
outlook. Additional information is provided under “Review of performance of the Operating Subsidiaries” in the
Board Report.

The forecast data and information of the aforementioned operating companies are drawn up autonomously and
communicated by the respective companies and are not homogeneous. Quantitative forecast disclosures prepared
by these operating companies and the type of information provided, as well as the underlying assumptions and
calculation methods vary according to the accounting principles applicable to each subsidiary and the conventional
application practices in the respective sector of reference.

EXOR N.V. in fact, is a holding company without a specific business of reference, head of a diversified and non-
integrated group that operates in different segments and does not exercise direction and coordination activities
over its subsidiaries, which operate in a completely independent manner.

EXOR N.V. deems that the forecast data and information of the subsidiaries are not significant or suitable for the
purposes of providing indications about the prospective economic trend of EXOR N.V.’s operations nor represent a
forecast or estimate of the company’s results and that therefore in assessing EXOR N.V.’s future prospects it is not
possible to rely on the data and prospective information published by the aforesaid operating subsidiaries.

MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE

Introduction

EXOR N.V. (“EXOR?” or the “Company”) is a public limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap), incorporated
under the laws of the Netherlands and its shares are listed in Italy on the Mercato Telematico Azionario organized
and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (the “MTA”). The Company's legal and tax residence is the Netherlands.

Capital Structure
Structure of share capital

Share class Number of shares Listing market Rights and obligations

Ordinary shares' 241,000,000 MTA/Borsa Italiana

Treasury shares per 31 December 2018 held by the Company: 6,709,893.

Economic and administrative rights

Each EXOR ordinary share entitles its holder to one vote at general meetings of shareholders — ordinary and
extraordinary — as well as to the economic and administrative rights according to the applicable provisions of law
and of the Company’s articles of association (the “Articles of Association”).

Issuance of shares

Shares may be issued pursuant to a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders. This competence concerns
all non-issued shares of the Company’s authorized capital, except insofar as the competence to issue shares is
vested in the board of directors (the “Board of Directors”) by a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders to
this extent.

Shares may be issued pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, if and insofar as the Board of Directors is
designated to do so by the general meeting of shareholders. Such designation can be made each time for a
maximum period of five years and can be extended each time for a maximum period of five years. A designation
must determine the number of shares of each class concerned which may be issued pursuant to a resolution of the
Board of Directors.

A resolution of the general meeting of shareholders to designate the Board of Directors as a body of the Company
authorized to issue shares can only be withdrawn upon proposal of the Board of Directors.

By means of the resolution adopted by the general meeting on 24 November 2016, the Board of Directors has
been designated as the competent body to issue ordinary shares and to grant rights to subscribe for shares for a
term of five (5) years with effect from 11 December 2016. The Board of Directors has been authorized to increase
the share capital with such number of shares for a nominal value up to five million Euro (Euro 5,000,000.00) and to
issue convertible bonds for an aggregate issue price up to one billion Euro (Euro 1,000,000,000.00), and to issue
the underlying ordinary shares (or granting of rights to subscribe for such underlying ordinary shares) pursuant to
the applicable conversion ratio.

Payment for shares shall be made in cash unless another form of consideration has been agreed. Payment in a
currency other than Euro may only be made with the consent of the Company.

Upon the issuance of ordinary shares, each holder of ordinary shares will have pre-emptive rights in proportion to
the aggregate nominal value of his ordinary shares. A shareholder will not have pre-emptive rights in respect of
ordinary shares issued against a non-cash contribution. Nor will the shareholder have pre-emptive rights in respect
of ordinary shares issued to employees of the Company or of a group company (groepsmaatschappi)).

Prior to each individual issuance of ordinary shares, pre-emptive rights may be restricted or excluded by a
resolution of the general meeting of shareholders. However, with respect to an issue of ordinary shares pursuant to
a resolution of the Board of Directors, the pre-emptive rights can be restricted or excluded pursuant to a resolution
of the Board of Directors if and insofar as the Board of Directors is designated to do so by the general meeting of
shareholders.

By means of the resolution adopted by the general meeting on 24 November 2016, the Board of Directors has
been authorized to limit or exclude pre-emptive rights of shareholders when issuing ordinary shares or granting
rights to subscribe for ordinary shares for a term of five (5) years with effect from 11 December 2016.

' The ordinary shares are registered shares, freely transferable and issued in electronic form. Shares are managed through the centralized clearing system
organized by Monte Titoli

BOARD REPORT



--- Page 42 ---

Holders of Special Voting Shares have no pre-emptive rights on the issuance of shares of any class and with
respect to the issuance of Special Voting Shares no pre-emptive rights exist.

The general meeting of shareholders or the Board of Directors, as the case may be, shall decide — when passing
the resolution to issue shares or rights to subscribe for shares — in which manner the shares shall be issued and, to
the extent that rights of pre-emption apply, within what period those rights may be exercised.

Special Voting Structure

In order to foster the development and continued involvement of a core and stable base of long-term shareholders
in a manner that reinforces the group’s stability, as well as providing EXOR with enhanced flexibility when pursuing
strategic investment opportunities in the future, the Articles of Association provide for a special-voting structure (the
“Special Voting Structure”). The purpose of the Special Voting Structure is to reward long-term ownership of EXOR
ordinary shares by granting long-term EXOR shareholders with special voting shares to which multiple voting rights
are attached additional to the right granted by each EXOR ordinary share held.

More precisely, according to the Special Voting Structure:

(i) after 5 years of uninterrupted ownership of EXOR ordinary shares held in the Loyalty Register (as defined
below), each EXOR shareholder will be entitled to 5 voting rights for each EXOR ordinary share and, to this
purpose, will receive — and EXOR will issue — one special voting share, to which 4 voting rights are
attached, and with a nominal value of Euro 0.04 (“Special Voting Share-A”), additional to each EXOR
ordinary share owned (to which 1 voting right is attached); and

(ii) after 10 years of uninterrupted ownership of EXOR ordinary shares held in the Loyalty Register (as defined
below), each EXOR shareholder will be entitled to 10 votes for each EXOR ordinary share and, to this
purpose, each Special Voting Share-A held will be converted into one special voting share B, to which 9
voting rights are attached, and with a nominal value of Euro 0.09 (“Special Voting Share-B”), additional to
each EXOR ordinary share owned (to which 1 voting right is attached).

Special Voting Shares-A and Special Voting Shares-B, which are collectively referred to as “Special Voting
Shares”, will not be tradable and will have only minimal economic entitlements.

Application for Special Voting Shares — Loyalty Register

A shareholder may at any time opt to become eligible for Special Voting Shares by requesting the agent (the
“Agent’) referred to Article 3.3 of the Terms and Conditions for Special Voting Shares (the “SVS Terms”), acting on
behalf of the Company, to register one or more ordinary shares in the loyalty register (the “Loyalty Register”)
maintained by the Company pursuant to the SVS Terms. Such request will need to be made by the relevant
shareholder via its intermediary, by submitting (i) a duly completed form (the “Election Form”) and (ii) an
intermediary confirmation statement attesting the uninterrupted holding of EXOR ordinary shares, pursuant to the
SVS Terms.

Together with the Election Form, the relevant shareholder must submit a duly signed power of attorney, irrevocably
instructing and authorizing the Agent to act on his behalf and to represent him in connection with the issuance,
allocation, acquisition, conversion, sale, repurchase and transfer of Special Voting Shares in accordance with and
pursuant to the SVS Terms (the “Power of Attorney”).

Upon receipt of the Election Form, the intermediary’s confirmation and the Power of Attorney, the Agent will
examine the same and use its reasonable efforts to inform the relevant shareholder, through his intermediary, as to
whether the request is accepted or rejected (and, if rejected, the reasons why) within ten business days of receipt
of the above-mentioned documents. The Agent may reject a request for reasons of incompleteness or
incorrectness of the Election Form, the Power of Attorney or the broker’s confirmation or in case of serious doubts
with respect to the validity or authenticity of such documents. If the Agent requires further information from the
relevant shareholder in order to process the request, then such shareholder shall provide all necessary information
and assistance required by the Agent in connection therewith.

EXOR ordinary shares for which a shareholder has issued a request for registration in the Loyalty Register — as
well as ordinary shares already registered — are referred to as “Electing Ordinary Shares”.

BOARD REPORT

--- Page 43 ---

Allocation of Special Voting Shares

For the sake of clarity, as of the effective date of the Merger (i.e. 11 December 2016) no Special Voting Shares
were issued by EXOR. As a consequence, assuming that a request for registration of EXOR ordinary shares in the
Loyalty Register was made at the effective date of the Merger, the requesting shareholder will be entitled to receive
Special Voting Shares-A only after 5 years from the abovementioned registration in the Loyalty Register.

As per the date on which an EXOR ordinary share has been registered in the Loyalty Register in the name of one
and the same shareholder or its Loyalty Transferee (as defined under the SVS Terms) for an uninterrupted period
of five years (the “SVS A Qualification Date”), such Electing Ordinary Share will become a “Qualifying Ordinary
Share A” and the holder thereof will be entitled to acquire one Special Voting Share A in respect of each of such
Qualifying Ordinary Share A.

As per the date on which an EXOR ordinary share has been registered in the Loyalty Register in the name of one
and the same shareholder or its Loyalty Transferee for an uninterrupted period of ten years (the “SVS B
Qualification Date”), such Electing Ordinary Share — which, in the meantime, will have become a Qualifying
Ordinary Share A — will become a “Qualifying Ordinary Share B”. Qualifying Ordinary Shares A and Qualifying
Ordinary Shares B are collectively referred to as “Qualifying Ordinary Shares”.

On the SVS B Qualification Date, the Agent will, on behalf of the Company, issue a conversion statement pursuant
to which the Special Voting Shares A corresponding to the number of Qualifying Ordinary Shares B will
automatically convert into an equal number of Special Voting Shares B.

Transfer of Electing Ordinary Shares, Qualifying Ordinary Shares and Special Voting Shares; removal from the
Loyalty Register

According to the SVS Terms and during the time in which Electing Ordinary Shares or Qualifying Ordinary Shares
are held in the Loyalty Register, these cannot be sold, disposed of or transferred unless to a Loyalty Transferee.

No shareholder shall, directly or indirectly, (a) sell, dispose of or transfer any Special Voting Share or otherwise
grant any right or interest therein, unless the shareholder is obliged to transfer Special Voting Shares to a Loyalty
Transferee, or (b) create or permit to exist any pledge, lien, fixed or floating charge or other encumbrance over any
Special Voting Share or any interest in any Special Voting Share.

As described above, anyone holding Electing Ordinary Shares or Qualifying Ordinary Shares may request at any
time that all or part of their Electing Ordinary Shares or Qualifying Ordinary Shares be removed from the Loyalty
Register and be transferred to the ordinary trading system, so as to enable the shareholder to freely dispose of
their EXOR shares as indicated below. Starting from the time the abovementioned request is made, it shall be
considered that the person holding Qualifying Ordinary Shares has waived the attribution of the voting rights
associated with the Special Voting Shares issued and attributed in relation to the Qualifying Ordinary Shares.

Each of the abovementioned requests shall result in a compulsory transfer by effect of which the Special Voting
Shares shall be offered and transferred to EXOR without any consideration (om nief) under the Articles of
Association and the SVS Terms. EXOR may keep the Special Voting Shares as treasury shares, but shall not be
entitled to exercise the related voting rights. Alternatively, EXOR may withdraw and cancel the Special Voting
Shares and by this effect the nominal value of those shares shall be allocated to the special capital reserve of
EXOR. Therefore, the voting rights embodied in Special Voting Shares shall cease to apply with reference to the
related Qualifying Ordinary Shares removed from the Loyalty Register.

Each shareholder holding Qualifying Ordinary Shares shall promptly notify EXOR about the occurrence of an event
of Change of Control (as defined under the SVS Terms) which concerns the same. A shareholder’s Change of
Control causes the related Qualifying Ordinary Shares to be removed from the Loyalty Register. The voting rights
attaching to Special Voting Shares and assigned in relation to the corresponding Qualifying Ordinary Shares shall
be suspended with immediate effect as a result of any event of Change of Control, directly or indirectly, related to
each holder of Qualifying Ordinary Shares held in the Loyalty Register.

Other characteristics of Special Voting Shares

Issuance of Special Voting Shares does not require qualified shareholders to correspond their nominal value to
EXOR. Pursuant to Article 13.4 of the Articles of Association, EXOR maintains a separate reserve (the “Special
Capital Reserve”) to pay-up Special Voting Shares. The Board of Directors is authorized to credit or debit the
Special Capital Reserve at the expense or in favour of the Company’s general share premium reserve. If the Board
of Directors so decides, Special Voting Shares can be issued at the expense of the Special Capital Reserve in lieu
of an actual payment for the shares concerned.

46

BOARD REPORT


--- Page 44 ---

However, the holder of Special Voting Shares issued at the expense of the Special Capital Reserve may at any
time substitute the charge of the Special Capital Reserve by making an actual payment to the Company in respect
of the shares concerned (in accordance with payment instructions provided by the Board of Directors on request) in
an amount equal to the nominal value of such Special Voting Shares (such shares being defined as “Special Voting
Shares paid-up in cash’).
As anticipated, Special Voting Shares have minimal economic entitlement. Under Dutch law, in fact, Special Voting
Shares cannot be excluded — as a whole — from the assignment of economic rights. Consequently, in accordance
with Article 28.2 of the Articles of Association, holders of Special Voting Shares paid-up in cash will be entitled to
the payment of an annual dividend equal to one per cent (1%) of the amount actually paid for such shares in
accordance with the above, provided, however, that profits realized with respect to the financial year concerned are
not fully appropriated to increase and/or form reserves. Actual payments made during the financial year to which
the dividend relates will not be counted.
In case of liquidation of the Company, out of the balance remaining after payment of its debts, the following
payments will be proceeded:
- firstly, the amounts actually paid-in on Special Voting Shares in accordance with Article 13.5 of the Articles of
Association will be transferred to those holders of Special Voting Shares whose Special Voting Shares have so
been actually paid for; and
- secondly, the balance remaining will be transferred to the holders of ordinary shares in proportion to the
aggregate number of the ordinary shares held by each of them.

Pursuant to Article 11 of the SVS Terms, in the event of a breach of any of the obligations of a shareholder, that
shareholder must pay to the Company an amount for each Special Voting Share affected by the relevant breach
(the “Compensation Amount”), which amount is the average closing price of an ordinary share on the MTA
calculated on the basis of the period of twenty (20) trading days prior to the day of the breach or, if such day is not
a business day, the preceding business day, such without prejudice to the Company’s right to request specific
performance.

Pursuant to Article 12 of the SVS Terms, the SVS Terms may be amended pursuant to a resolution by the Board of
Directors, provided, however, that any material, not merely technical amendment will be subject to the approval of
the general meeting of shareholders of EXOR, unless such amendment is required to ensure compliance with
applicable laws or listing regulations.

Repurchase of Shares

The Board of Directors has been authorized, by the annual general meeting of shareholders held on 29 May 2018,
to repurchase, for a term of 18 months, its own fully paid-up ordinary shares up to the maximum number of ordinary
shares that can be repurchased under Dutch law, and further within the limits of Dutch law and the Company’s
Articles of Association, through a purchase on the stock exchange or otherwise. For shares held by the Company
or its subsidiaries no voting rights may be exercised and no payments will be made on shares held by the
Company or its subsidiaries. Subject to meeting certain conditions, EXOR ordinary shares can be registered in the
Loyalty Register to become eligible for Special Voting Shares.

On 14 November 2018 the Company announced a share buyback program (the “Program”) will involve the
repurchase from time to time of up to €300 million of ordinary shares and is intended to optimize the Company’s
capital structure. This amount represents approximately 50% of the extraordinary dividend that is expected to be
paid by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (“FCA”) to the Company following the disposal of Magneti Marelli.

The Program will be conducted in the framework of the resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders (“AGM”) held on 29 May 2018, which authorized the repurchase of up to a maximum amount of
500 million of ordinary shares during the 18 month period following the date of the AGM and up to a maximum
number of shares not to exceed the limits set by law. The repurchase price per share, excluding expenses, will not
exceed by more than 10% the official reference price recorded on the Italian Stock Exchange (MTA) on the day
before each transaction is made.

The Program will expire on 29 November 2019, or until such authority is extended or renewed before such date.

Decisions regarding the actual transactions including but not limited to the timing, number and value of ordinary
shares repurchased, will be at the sole discretion of the Company. The Company is not obliged to carry out the
Program and, if implemented, the Program may be suspended, discontinued or modified at any time, for any
reason and without previous notice, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

--- Page 45 ---

The repurchases will be carried out in compliance with applicable rules and regulations, including the Market Abuse
Regulation 596/2014 and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052.

Details of the transactions carried out will be disclosed to the market within the terms and conditions required by
the current and applicable regulations.

At 15 March 2019, the Company holds 8,414,646 ordinary shares in treasury (3.49% of issued capital).

Restrictions on the transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of EXOR ordinary shares, no limitations on ownership and no clauses
requiring acceptance on the part of the Company or of other shareholders upon a transfer of shares.

The above shall not apply to transfers of Special Voting Shares, or Electing Ordinary Shares or Qualifying Ordinary
Shares: for such provisions, reference is made to the section above.

Restrictions on voting rights
There are no restrictions on voting rights.

Shareholders
Significant shareholdings

Based on the regulatory filings with the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financiéle
Markten, the “AFM”) the following entities own as of 31 December 2018, directly or indirectly, more than 3% of the
share capital carrying voting rights:

Shareholder % of issued capital
Giovanni Agnelli B.V. 52.99%

Harris Associates LP 7.36 Y

Southeastern Asset Management, Inc. 3.01%

In total five shareholders, under which Giovanni Agnelli B.V., are registered, for a total amount of 128,944,325
shares, in the Loyalty Register to participate in the Special Voting Structure, as explained above.

Giovanni Agnelli B.V. is the largest shareholder of EXOR through its 52.99% shareholding interest in EXOR’s
issued capital. Giovanni Agnelli B.V. is a Dutch private company with limited liability which shares are held by
descendants of Giovanni Agnelli, founder of Fiat. The main business objective is to preserve unity and continuity of
its controlling equity interest in EXOR.

Consequently, Giovanni Agnelli B.V. could strongly influence all matters submitted to a vote of EXOR’s
shareholders, including approval of annual dividends, election and removal of directors and approval of
extraordinary business transactions.

Employee shareholdings: system for the exercise of voting rights

A specific mechanism for the exercise of voting rights applicable to employees’ shareholdings does not exist. In
particular the voting rights on shares deriving from the vesting of shares or from the exercise of option rights under
stock option plans or incentive plans — for information on which reference should be made to Section
“Remuneration of Directors” — are not subject to any form of restriction and are directly exercisable by the
beneficiaries.

Shareholder agreements

EXOR is not aware of shareholder agreements concerning either the exercise of the rights attached to the
Company’s shares or the transfer of the shares.

RISK MANAGEMENT, RISKS AND CONTROL SYSTEM

To assess the risk inherent to the Company's activities and to the effectiveness of the internal control system
EXOR has in place an internal control and risk management system based on the model provided by the COSO
Framework (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission Report — Enterprise Risk
Management model) and the principles of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (hereafter also the “System”).
The system consists of a set of policies, procedures, rules and organizational structures which purpose is to
provide an adequate process for the identification, measurement, management and monitoring of the principal risks
in order to ensure the reliability, accuracy and timeliness of financial information, the safeguarding of the
Company’s assets, the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes and the Company's compliance with
laws and regulations. An effective internal control and risk management system contributes to the conduct of the
business in a manner consistent with its pre-established objectives and facilitates well-informed decision-making.
The System is integrated within the organization and governance structure adopted by EXOR and is developed
giving adequate consideration to the reference models and the best practices available nationally and
internationally.

The responsibility for the institution and maintenance of an effective System which is coherent with EXOR’s
business, process objectives and for the corresponding risk management method employed with a pre-established
containment plan is entrusted to the Board of Directors.

In particular EXOR’s System operates at three levels of internal control:

- First Level: operating areas identification, evaluation and monitoring of applicable risks in the single processes
and the establishment of specific actions managing such risks. At this level are located the structures
responsible for the individual risks, for their identification, measurement and management, as well as for the
performance of the necessary checks.

- Second Level: departments responsible for risk control which define methodologies and tools for managing
tisks and monitoring of such risks.

- Third Level: provides an independent and objective assurance of the adequacy and effective operation of the
first and second level of control and in general of the overall mode of managing risks. This activity is carried
out by the Internal Audit function whose activities are concluded independently.

The System is subject to verification and updating annually in order to ensure its constant suitability as an
instrument of control over the business’s principal areas of risk.

The Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of the Company’s System.

Internal control and external control over financial reporting

The System over financial reporting is set in a broader framework of the internal control and risk management and
has the purpose of ensuring the reliability, accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the Group’s financial
information.

The System of internal controls over financial reporting is focused on the procedures and organizational structures
which ensure the reliability, accuracy, completeness and timeliness of financial reporting.

The System of internal control over financial reporting aims to ensure the adequate and effective application of the
administrative and accounting procedures designed to provide a true and fair representation and reliable
information on the business activities in the financial reports (annual consolidated and company only financial
statements and shortened half yearly consolidated financial statements) prepared by the Company.

The approach adopted by the Company for the evaluation, monitoring and continuous updating of the System over
financial reporting, is based on a ‘top-down, risk-based’ process consistent with the COSO Framework. This
enables focus on areas of higher risk and/or materiality, where there is risk of significant errors, including those
attributable to fraud, in the elements of the financial statements and related documents.

The principal characteristics of the System over financial reporting are based on the following components and
phases:

- Identification and assessment of administrative and accounting risks.

- Identification of the controls responding to the risks identified.

- Verification of the effective application of the controls and evaluation of any problems detected.

BOARD REPORT

51


--- Page 49 ---

The EXOR System over financial reporting has been developed taking into consideration existing law, the
regulations, best practices as well as the guidelines provided by the competent bodies and is composed of the
following administrative and accounting procedures:

- Code of Conduct — which illustrates the ethical principles and values of the Company and must be observed
by Company personnel involved, for any reasons, in the implementation of the System over financial reporting;

- System of delegated powers and proxies — which identifies the powers to represent the Company by individual
managers;

- Risk Management process — which identifies roles, responsibilities and methodologies in performing the risk
management activity and in the preparation, diffusion and checking of financial reports disclosed to the market;

- Administrative and accounting procedures — which establish the responsibilities and rules for the process
controls to be applied;

- Financial reporting instructions and closing timetables — which are used to communicate operational
instructions for the preparation of the reporting package;

- The process of internal attestation by the corporate bodies of the significant subsidiaries as regards the data
and the related internal control system under their responsibility reported to the Parent company.

Internal control covering the preparation and processing of financial information
Overview of the organizational structure and management of accounting and financial information

The consolidated financial statements of the EXOR group are prepared in accordance with IFRS standards and
interpretations as adopted in the European Union at the balance sheet date.

As parent company, EXOR N.V., under the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer defines and oversees the
preparation of reported accounting and financial information of EXOR N.V. and the process related to the financial
information being requested to the operating subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Chief Financial Officer of EXOR N.V.
ensures that the processes for preparing accounting and financial information produce reliable information and
give, in a timely manner, a fair view of the Company’s financial position and results. He obtains and reviews all
information that he deems useful, such as closing options, critical accounting positions and judgments, changes in
accounting method and results of audits performed by the external auditors.

For consolidation purposes, the Chief Financial Officers of operating subsidiaries are responsible for preparing the
reporting packages of such companies in accordance with group instructions. These financial statements are
prepared under the control of their respective Board of Directors and are responsibility of company management of
each subsidiary. Each reporting package is accompanied with a representation letter in which management of the
subsidiary takes the responsibility of the information provided in the consolidation process.

Members of the EXOR N.V. Audit Committee examine the annual and interim financial statements of EXOR N.V.
and monitor the process for preparing accounting and financial information. Their conclusions are based notably on
information produced by the Chief Financial Officer and his team, exchanges with the team during Audit Committee
meetings and the findings of internal audits. The Chairman of the Audit Committee reports on the committee’s work
to the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors of EXOR N.V. approves EXOR N.V. consolidated financial statements (interim and annual)
and separate (company) financial statements.

Processes for the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information for the consolidated financial
statements

The process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are organized and coordinated under the
responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer.

The consolidated financial statements are produced using a consolidation software configured to automate a
certain number of consistency checks on the data in the reporting packages.

Detailed consolidation instructions are sent before each interim and annual closing to the attention of the finance
departments of the various consolidated subsidiaries.

The closing schedule for accounts and the related instructions are prepared sufficiently in advance to enable the
financial teams of the subsidiaries to organize their procedures and anticipate closing constraints.

Risk Management

EXOR has adopted its own Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) system to identify and analyze the main risks
associated with the Company’s activities and achievement of its objectives.

The EXOR ERM system is based on the above mentioned COSO ERM Framework, which defines risk
management as a “process effected by the Board of Directors, management and other personnel, applied in setting
strategy across the organization and designed to identify potential events that may affect the business, in order to
manage the risk within the risk appetite and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the
business objectives”. The COSO Framework is based on five areas: the control environment, risk assessment,
control activities, information and communication, and monitoring and supervision.

The Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of the Company's internal control and ERM system. The Audit
Committee, together with executive management, every other year performs a thorough exercise for the
identification of the main risks and their ranking. In 2017 a detailed risk assessment and update of the risk profile
was performed and in 2018 a re-assessment of the relevant risks and risk appetite has been performed.

The ERM system is integrated within the Company’s organization and corporate governance, supporting the
efficiency and effectiveness of business processes, the reliability of financial information and compliance with laws
and regulations. An effective ERM system contributes to the conduct of the business in a manner consistent with its
objectives and facilitates well-informed decision-making.

In this context, the Board of Directors is responsible for the identification of the risks to which EXOR and the
“Holdings System” are exposed to in relation to the business objectives and Company characteristics, and for
performing an assessment of the possible risk scenarios mitigation, considering the effectiveness of the control
process currently in place.

The EXOR ERM system is subject to verification and updating over time in order to ensure its constant suitability
as an instrument of control over the business’s principal areas of risk.

An assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of key controls is carried out through tests performed by
the Internal Audit Function, using sampling techniques recognized as best practices internationally.

The assessment of the controls may require the definition of compensating controls and plans for remediation and
improvement. The results of monitoring are subject to periodic review by management and are communicated to
the Audit Committee (which in return reports to the Board of Directors). No significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses have been reported by the Internal Audits performed.

Risk Appetite

EXOR set its risk appetite within risk taking and risk acceptance parameters which are driven by applicable laws,
the Code of Conduct, core principles and values, corporate policies and directives.

EXOR operates within a moderate overall risk range, inherent to its activities and strategy. In this context, EXOR’s
highest risk appetite relates to the strategic and operational objectives related to a positive Net Asset Value (NAV)
per share / MSCI ratio in the long term and maintaining an adequate credit rating and cash flow to enable continuity
of investment activities, while ensuring in any case the compliance with the criteria that direct EXOR investment
choices.

EXOR’s lowest risk appetite relates to the objectives of protecting the Group reputation, compliance with the rules
and regulations and of accuracy and reliability of the financial reporting. Meeting applicable legal and regulatory
obligations will take priority over other business objectives.

The EXOR risk management and internal control system comprises a structured process aimed at addressing

individual risk categories, with a defined risk appetite applied to each category as detailed below:

EXOR has established the appetite for principal risks, identifying its overall risk capacity and appetite position.
Risk metrics for each principal risk have been identified in order to put in place monitoring activity and corrective
mitigation actions, if needed.

Key Risks and Key trends

As a part of the 2018 risk assessment process, management re-assessed the risks identified in 2017 as significant.
Based on the potential business impact and likelihood of occurrence, as well as existing and/or planned
countermeasures (mitigating actions) the risks have been reviewed and updated where needed. The risk impact
could result in a material direct or indirect adverse effect on its business, operations, financial condition and
performance, reputation and/or other interests. The results of this assessment were presented to the Audit
Committee on 6 September 2018 and to the Board of Directors on 13 November 2018.

EXOR expects that the implemented (internal and external) controls will mitigate the risks up to the level of the risk
appetite.

The sequence in which these risks and mitigating actions are presented does not reflect any order of importance,
ity. For further information regarding the risks EXOR faces, refer to the section Risk Factors

likelihood or material
below.

Dividend risk (Cash
Flow) /
underperformance of
subsidiaries

(Financial risks)

Risk of holding shares in companies that do
not generate a cash flow of dividends
sufficient to manage operating costs and net
financial expenses of EXOR.

The risk of underperformance of the
subsidiaries has been combined with the
dividend risk, as underperformance and
divided are related to each other/connected.

Careful management of cash in / cash out and
investment portfolio diversification. EXOR
maintains an adequate cash flow management
by performing cash flow analysis, adjusting
and monitoring the flows on a regular basis.

The Company risk management approach
mixes a wide variety of investments within the
portfolio thus mitigating unsystematic risk
events in the collection of dividends from the
investments.

Portfolio composition

(Strategic/operational
risk)

Risk that investment decisions do not allow
EXOR to (i) obtain a return on investments
that will increase the Net Asset Value (NAV)
per share, surpassing the MSCI World Index
in USD; and (ii) define an adequate portfolio
mix in terms of diversification of the
investments, resulting in difficulties in
optimizing the Group's future performance.

The Company risk management approach
mixes a wide variety of investments within the
portfolio. The Company portfolio consists of
different kinds of investments, consequently
characterized by an overall lower risk level.

Company investment procedures ensure
adequate evaluation also in relation to portfolio
composition.

Stock market
performance

(Strategic risk)

Risk that fluctuations in the stock market can
affect the value of investments.

Asset allocation. The Company risk
management approach mixes a wide variety of
investments within the portfolio. The Company
portfolio is composed of diversified and
different kind of investment, consequently
characterized by an overall lower risk level.

The diversification by sector and geographic
for example mitigates unsystematic risk events
in the portfolio, so the positive performance of
some investments neutralizes the negative
performance of others.

Loss of key
personnel

(Operational risk)

The risk of losing key resources (in EXOR or
subsidiary companies) or having inadequate
succession planning.

Attract, retain and motivate directors as well as
employees and other individuals having
business relationships with EXOR to reward
such persons for their loyalty and commitment
to the long-term value creation.

Succession plans and management of

Risk Factors

The following risks and uncertainties are deemed material and, in the judgement of the Board of Directors, relevant
to the expectation of the Company's continuity for the period of twelve months after the preparation of the Report of
Operations.

RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS, STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS

Risks relating to international markets and exposure to changes in local conditions and trade policies, as
well as economic, geopolitical or other events

The earnings and financial position of EXOR and its subsidiaries are affected by the performance of financial
markets and macroeconomic variables over which EXOR exercises little or no control.

EXOR is subject to risks inherent in operating globally, including those related to:

- exposure to local economic and political conditions;

- import and/or export restrictions

- multiple tax regimes, including regulations relating to transfer pricing and withholding and other taxes on
remittances and other payments to or from subsidiaries;

- foreign investment and/or trade restrictions or requirements, foreign exchange controls and restrictions on the
repatriation of funds; and

- the introduction of more stringent laws and regulations.

Unfavorable developments in any one or a combination of these areas (which may vary from country to country)
could have a material adverse effect on EXOR’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

With the increasing interconnectedness of global economic and financial systems, a financial crisis, natural
disaster, geopolitical crisis, or other significant event in one area of the world can have an immediate and
devastating impact on markets around the world.

For instance, in June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European
Union in a national referendum. The referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship
between the United Kingdom and the European Union. It remains unclear when a withdrawal agreement, or any
alternative agreement will be finalized and ratified.

Additionally, in recent years, certain member countries of the European Union have implemented austerity
measures to avoid defaulting on debt repayments. If a country within the euro area were to default on its debt or
withdraw from the euro currency, or, in a more extreme circumstance, the euro currency were to be dissolved
entirely, the impact on markets around the world, and on EXOR’s global business, could be immediate and
significant.

New or revised agreements between the United States and its trading partners may also impact business and
potential changes in tax laws that could adversely affect U.S. operations. These developments have introduced an
elevated level of economic and policy uncertainty and could have a have a material adverse effect on business,
financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to slow economic growth or recession, other economic circumstances, such as increases in energy
prices, fuel prices and fluctuations in prices of raw materials or contractions in infrastructure spending, could have
negative consequences for the industries in which EXOR operates.

It is not possible to provide an indication of the future effects of the aforementioned factors and variables which
may have an adverse impact on the demand for products and services, the earnings, business prospects and
financial position of EXOR and its subsidiaries and affiliates.

Risks relating to the business, operations and profitability of EXOR

The composition of EXOR’s investment portfolio may vary substantially from time to time. Maintaining long-term
ownership in investments and a flow of investments and divestments in new investment activities involves
commercial risk, such as having a high exposure to a certain industry or an individual holding, changed market
conditions for finding attractive investment candidates or barriers that arise and prevent exit from a holding at the
chosen time.

56

BOARD REPORT


--- Page 54 ---

EXOR does not have operations or significant assets other than the capital stock of its subsidiaries and other
intercompany balances. EXOR has cash outflows in the form of other expenses, payments on its indebtedness and
dividends to its shareholders. EXOR relies primarily on cash dividends and payments from its subsidiaries to meet
its cash outflows. In particular, EXOR does not have a significant operating business of its own and, accordingly,
EXOR financial condition depends upon the results of its investment activities, including the receipt of funds by
other members of the Group. EXOR expects future dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries to
be the principal source of funds to repay its indebtedness and to pay expenses and dividends. The ability of
EXOR's subsidiaries to make such payments (in the form of dividends and intercompany payments) depends on
their economic performance and financial condition and may also be limited by contractual or regulatory
constraints. No assurance can be given that EXOR will receive adequate funding to maintain its financial condition.
The financial results of the EXOR Group and of EXOR are no indicators of the future profitability of EXOR. For the
2018 financial statements, the Group’s assessment is that no material uncertainties (as defined in paragraph 25 of
IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements) exist about its ability to continue as a going concern.

There can be no assurance concerning the profitability of EXOR in future periods.

Risks associated with the distribution of dividends

The distribution of dividends by EXOR and the amount of such dividends depend on the Company’s future profits
which in turn depend on the dividends distributed by EXOR’s subsidiaries and affiliates and on the gains realized
on divestments of these companies, events which by their nature are neither periodic nor recurrent. Accordingly,
EXOR’s results in different financial years may not be regular and/or comparable. Where investments have been
made having recourse to debt financing, part of the resources arising from the divestment will, as a priority, be
applied in repayment of such debt and only the remaining part may be used for the distribution of dividends.

It will be recalled that under the merger agreement relating to the PartnerRe acquisition, there is a restriction on
payment of dividends on common shares declared with respect to any fiscal quarter to an amount not exceeding
67% of the net income during such fiscal quarter until 31 December 2020. As explained in the paragraph of
PartnerRe’s Risk factors, the dividends distribution from PartnerRe depends also on the company’s capital
requirements including the regulatory requirements.

Further, EXOR does not have a policy for the payment of dividends (for example a minimum distribution per share
in absolute terms or as a percentage-dividend payout) and has not made any specific undertaking in this respect.

Risks relating to the EXOR’s credit rating

EXOR’s corporate credit rating from S&P is currently “BBB+” for long-term debt and “A-2” for short-term debt with a
stable outlook.

EXOR’s ability to access capital markets and the cost of borrowing in those markets is highly dependent on its
credit ratings. The rating agencies may review their ratings for possible downgrades and any downgrades would
increase the Issuer’s cost of capital, potentially limiting its access to sources of financing, and could negatively
affect its businesses.

Risks associated with market conditions

EXOR holds investments in both publicly listed companies and unlisted companies. The value of the investments in
listed companies is based on their market prices, whereas for investments in unlisted companies one of the
methods used to value the shareholdings is based on multiples of comparable listed companies. Therefore,
changes in prices and market conditions can negatively impact the value of EXOR’s business operations. A
substantial weakening of equity and/or bond markets or changes in interest rates and/or currency exchange rates
could impact negatively on the value of EXOR’s businesses.

Further, the operating costs which EXOR incurs cannot be reduced with the same speed as a fall or unabated
decline in financial markets and, in the case of inadequately efficient cost management, this could negatively
impact the financial results of EXOR.

Risks associated with the sectors and markets in which EXOR’s subsidiaries operate

Through its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates, EXOR is present mainly in the reinsurance business
(PartnerRe), automobile business (FCA), agricultural and construction equipment business (CNH Industrial),
Ferrari brand, publishing (The Economist Group) and professional football (Juventus Football Club). As a result,
EXOR is exposed to the risks typical of the sectors and markets in which such subsidiaries and affiliates operate.
Therefore, the performance of the main subsidiaries has a very significant impact on the earnings, financial position
and cash flows of EXOR.

The paragraph Risk Factors from main subsidiaries highlights the most significant risk factors related to FCA,
PartnerRe, CNH Industrial and Ferrari.

BOARD REPORT

57


--- Page 55 ---

Exposure to financial counterparty risk

EXOR is exposed to financial institution counterparty risk and will continue to be exposed to the risk of loss if
counterparty financial institutions fail or are otherwise unable to meet their obligations. Financial services
institutions are inter-related as a result of trading, counterparty and other relationships. The Company has
exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in
the financial industry, including financial intermediaries, brokers and dealers, commercial banks and investment
banks for its own account. Defaults by, or even the perceived questioning of the creditworthiness of, one or more
financial services institutions or the financial services industry, generally, has led and may continue to lead to
market-wide liquidity problems and could also lead to losses or defaults. The exact nature of the risks faced by
EXOR is difficult to predict and guard against in view of the severity of the global financial crisis and the fact that
many of the related risks to the business are totally, or in part, outside of the control of the Company.

Risks associated with the consolidated indebtedness of the EXOR Group

The overall amount of the consolidated indebtedness of the EXOR Group could have a significant negative impact
on the business and the financial performance of EXOR and of the EXOR Group. A deterioration in market
conditions, which the companies of the Group were not able to tackle rapidly, could have negative effects on
revenues and cash flows of Group companies; such a situation could result in higher financial charges with a
consequent negative impact on the profitability of such Group companies and as a consequence on the flow of
dividends and other payments to EXOR. The deterioration of the economic and financial position of the Group
companies could, also, have negative effects on the possibility of accessing sources of additional funding for the
achievement of the business objectives of EXOR and of the Group companies, for capital expenditure, working
capital and the repayment of debt as well as on the cost of the latter; such circumstances could render the Group
more vulnerable. Further, if EXOR and the other companies in the Group should fail to generate the financial
resources necessary to repay debt within the terms agreed, they would be compelled to seek other financial
resources or to refinance or renegotiate existing debt on more onerous terms and conditions, with the consequent
limitation of available funds and the increase of the related costs. Any difficulty in obtaining financing could have a
significant impact on the Group, its business prospects and its profits. It should be noted that EXOR has not given
any guarantees regarding the indebtedness of its operating subsidiaries and affiliates.

Risks associated with acquisitions and disposals

No assurance can be given that the present investments or those in the future, if completed, will not impact
negatively on EXOR’s results and financial position in the short and/or the medium term and on its ratings and will
not encounter obstacles of an administrative, legal, technical, industrial, operational, regulatory or financial policy
nature or other difficulties, such that they may not assure the achievement of the results, objectives or benefits
expected. EXOR is also exposed to the risk that the disposal of its investments may be effected on terms and
conditions which are unsatisfactory with consequent negative impacts on its financial position and on its own
prospects.

EXOR is a diversified holding company and in the normal course of its business assesses new investment
opportunities as well as opportunities to disinvest, such activity being its core business. In assessing new
investment opportunities, EXOR intends to keep its indebtedness at a level consistent with the objective of
maintaining an investment grade rating, that is to say a "BBB” or higher. Any delay in completing, or the failure to
complete, an acquisition, disposal, merger, joint venture or similar operation, could prejudice the full achievement
or delay fully achieving, the results and the benefits expected for EXOR, and could have significant negative
repercussions on its business prospects and on its results and/or its financial situation.

Risks associated with the investment portfolio and the concentration of investments

EXOR is a diversified holding company and, consequently, the results of its major investments and the financial
resources distributed by the subsidiaries and affiliates (as dividends or otherwise) have a significant influence on its
results. The failure to achieve the objectives or the revision of the objectives by the subsidiaries and affiliates due
to, among other things, deterioration of economic and financial conditions and of the general conditions of the
market, may have a significant negative effect on the economic results and financial position and on the business
activities, strategies and prospects of the EXOR Group and of EXOR, as well as on the performance of the EXOR
shares on the stock market. No assurance can be given with regard to the fact that EXOR will receive constant
flows of dividends from the subsidiaries and affiliates which depend on the economic and financial performance
and the investment and dividend policies of such companies.

EXOR holds a limited number of investments and, consequently, the economic and financial performance of EXOR
and of the EXOR Group may be materially influenced by the negative performance or indeed the negative
economic and financial results even of one of the investments made.

58

BOARD REPORT


--- Page 56 ---

EXOR’s investment portfolio is monitored and analyzed constantly both through use of corporate governance rights
(e.g. board representation) and through constant dialogue with the management of the subsidiaries and affiliates
without affecting their independence as the managers of the companies.

EXOR does not have a specific policy on investment and disposal. Investment decisions taken by EXOR are
formulated on the basis of in-depth assessments and of expertise developed in the specific sectors, as well as on
the basis of the potential contribution of the individual investment to the geographical and sector diversification of
the portfolio and of the capacity to generate future cash flows.

The maintenance of long term investments and the decisions to invest and divest entail business risks, such as a
high exposure to specific industries or to a particular investment, changes in market conditions and the presence of
obstacles which impede the disposal of its investments.

Risks associated with the loss of key management figures

The success of EXOR and of the EXOR Group has depended, and will continue to depend, partly upon the ability
to attract and retain management personnel and its abilities to manage efficiently EXOR and the EXOR Group. If
the EXOR Group should lose the contribution of key executives, this could have a significant negative effect on the
business prospects as well as the financial results and/or financial position.

Furthermore, if one or more managers should resign from service with EXOR or with EXOR’s investee companies
and should it not be possible to adequately replace them in a timely manner with persons of equal skill and
experience, the competitive capacity of such companies could diminish with potentially negative effects on the
business and on the ability to replicate the results achieved in the past.

Risks associated with the presentation of consolidated data in shortened form (Shortened Consolidation)
The Shortened Consolidation data is prepared by EXOR on the basis of a “shortened” method of consolidation in
which the data derived from the IFRS financial statements of EXOR and of the subsidiaries of the Holdings System:
Exor Nederland N.V. (the Netherlands); EXOR S.A. (Luxemburg); Ancom USA Inc. (USA); Exor SN LLC (USA);
Exor Investments Limited (United Kingdom); Exor Investment (UK) LLP (United Kingdom) are included in the
financial statements of the parent company EXOR using the line-by-line method, while the data derived from the
financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS of the operating subsidiaries and affiliates (PartnerRe, FCA,
CNH Industrial, Ferrari, Juventus Football Club, The Economist Group and Welltec) are included in the financial
statements of the parent company EXOR using the equity method.

While the data and information prepared using the shortened consolidation method are recognized by the financial
community, by financial counterparties and by the ratings agencies, and EXOR believes that these data and
information facilitate analysis of the financial position and results of EXOR, such data do not fully represent, nor
should be treated as the consolidated financial position of the EXOR Group prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In fact the shortened consolidation method is not contemplated
in the reference accounting standards on the presentation of consolidated financial statements and may not be
consistent with the method adopted by other groups and, therefore, such data may not be comparable with the
data reported by such groups.

The consolidated data prepared in shortened form are not audited by the independent auditors.

Risks associated with tax assessments of the Italian tax authorities relating to periods prior to the date
when the merger became legally effective

It should be noted that the merged company, EXOR S.p.A. was taxable for IRES and IRAP purposes up until the
legally effective date of the Merger.

For Italian tax purposes the Merger qualifies as an intra-community cross-border merger as defined by the Italian
tax regulations (TUIR) which implemented E.U. Council Directive 1990/434 dated 23 July 1990 on the common
system of taxation to be applied to mergers, de-mergers, transfers of assets and share exchanges involving
companies of differing Member States (consolidated in E.U. Council Directive 2009/133 dated 12 October 2009,
the “Merger Directive’).

The Italian tax regulations provide for the fiscal neutrality of the intra-community merger with respect to assets and
liabilities which remain connected with a permanent organization in Italy, providing, conversely, that elements
which do not remain connected with a permanent organization in Italy are deemed to be realized at fair value.
Considering that EXOR N.V. has not maintained a permanent organization in Italy after the Merger, all the
components of EXOR S.p.A. (including investments in companies, financial liabilities and tax-suspended reserves)
have been treated as having been realized at fair value, resulting in the crystallization of taxable surpluses (“EXIT
gains”) in the financial position at the 10 December 2016 merger date.

EXOR believes that the related taxation which was declared and paid in June 2017 is correctly determined,
however any related disputes and Italian tax authority decisions could have a negative effect, also for a significant
amount, on the results of future financial years.

Risks and uncertainties associated with the development and interpretation of tax regulations

The economic and financial activities of EXOR and of its principal subsidiaries and associates make it subject to a
variety of taxes and duties. EXOR and those subsidiaries and affiliates are, therefore, exposed to the risk that the
level of taxation to which they are subjected may rise in the future. Any such increase in the level of taxation, or the
introduction of new taxes, to which EXOR and its principal subsidiaries and affiliates may be subjected, could have
negative effects on the economic results and financial position of EXOR.

Additionally, EXOR and its principal investee companies are also exposed to risk from the interpretative complexity
of tax regulations and may from time to time be subjected to inspections by the tax authorities.

RISKS RELATED TO THE COMMON SHARES

Risks connected with share price performance in relation to the activities of EXOR

EXOR’s results will depend on the performance of the investments which it makes. These investments, considering
the type of activity performed, are characterized by high levels of uncertainty, problems with forecasting and a priori
assessments that are not always objective. There is no guarantee that EXOR will be able to transmit to the market
the correct interpretation of the risk-opportunity relationship of the investments made and of their progressive
performance, with resulting possible negative impact on the performance of the market price of EXOR common
shares.

The loyalty voting structure could have a negative effect on the liquidity of the common shares and reduce
the common share price

The introduction of the Special Voting Structure could reduce the liquidity of EXOR common shares adversely
affecting the trading price in the market. The Special Voting Structure is intended to reward long-term shareholding
and provide an incentive for a stable shareholder base, giving shareholders the opportunity to decide to receive
special voting shares after a certain uninterrupted period of ownership of common shares.

The Special Voting Shares cannot be traded and must be transferred to EXOR for no consideration (om niet)
immediately prior to cancellation of the common shares from the EXOR special register.

The Special Voting Structure may reduce liquidity in EXOR common shares and adversely affect their trading price.
No Special Voting Shares had been issued at the Merger date and none are outstanding at 31 December 2018.

The Special Voting Structure may make it more difficult for shareholders to acquire a controlling interest,
change the management or the strategy of the Group or exercise influence over it, resulting in a reduction
in the market price of the common shares

The provisions of the Articles of Association which establish the Special Voting Structure, allowing qualifying
shareholders to exercise up to 5 or 10 voting rights for each EXOR common share held, may make it more difficult
to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of EXOR and prevent or discourage any initiatives seeking to change
EXOR’s management, even if a change of control were considered favorably by shareholders holding the majority
of the EXOR common shares.
The Special Voting Structure may prevent or discourage initiatives of shareholders seeking to change the
ownership structure or the strategy of EXOR or to exercise their influence and also may prevent or discourage
initiatives of shareholders seeking to bring about changes in the company’s management.

Shareholders who hold a significant quantity of EXOR common shares for the uninterrupted periods prescribed in
the Articles of Association and who request special voting shares could be in a position to exercise a significant
quota of voting rights at meetings of shareholders and to have substantial influence over EXOR.

Based on the most recent information available Giovanni Agnelli B.V. holds 52.99% of the issued capital of EXOR,
such that its control is not at present contestable.

It should be recalled, however, that the Special Voting Structure will commence to have its effect only when five
years have passed from the date of adoption of the new Articles of Association following the merger’s becoming
effective, assuming that the holders of EXOR common shares satisfy the conditions for requesting Special Voting
Shares. In fact, as of the date of the merger becoming effective no Special Voting Shares had been issued.

Risks related to the tax treatment of Special Voting Shares

No statutory, judicial or administrative authority directly discusses how the receipt, ownership, or disposition of
Special Voting Shares should be treated for Italian or Dutch tax purposes and as a result the tax consequences in
the Netherlands are uncertain. The fair market value of the EXOR Special Voting Shares, which may be relevant to
the tax consequences, is a factual determination and is not governed by any guidance that directly addresses such
a situation. Considering that the EXOR Special Voting Shares are not transferable (other than, in very limited
circumstances, together with the associated EXOR common shares) and that a shareholder’s rights to receive
amounts in respect of the Special Voting Shares are extremely limited, EXOR believes and intends to take the
position that the fair market value of each Special Voting Share is minimal. However, the relevant tax authorities
could assert that the value of the Special Voting Shares as determined by EXOR is incorrect. The tax treatment of
the Special Voting Shares and the consequences of acquiring them, therefore, are not entirely clear and
established.
