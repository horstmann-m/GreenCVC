In accordance with legal and regulatory provisions in force, the Management Board has convened you here in order to inform you on the
management of your company and its subsidiaries and to submit for your approval the financial statements for the year ended

31 December 2018.

Somfy is the global leader in automated opening and closing systems for both residential and commercial buildings, and a key player in the

connected home.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR

», E’ /E KKz [*% WK%/d/KE E
KE*K>/ d/KE Dd,K t/d,/E d,

Somfy has held a 70% interest in }}°, the Chinese leader in
tubular motors since 2010 and has a call option on the remaining
30%, exercisable from 2035. Governance alongside the minority
shareholder in the company was implemented upon acquisition,
with Somfy having majority representation on the Dooya Board of
Directors.

Since then, Dooya has grown at a sustained rate while remaining
highly profitable. Its sales increased from €35 million in 2010 to
€163 million in 2017 and its current operating margin fluctuated
between 6 and 7% over the period, except last year, as a result of
higher raw material prices and_ significant industrial and
commercial investments.

Under the influence of Somfy, the company has focused on the
Chinese domestic market, where it now holds a leading position,
but has consequently been less active than its main local
competitors in international markets in which it has significant
potential due to its positioning.

For this reason, the Group wished to clarify its brand policy and

has decided to:

— focus on Somfy and related brands (Simu, BFT, Asa, etc.),
spearheads of the connected building market, in order to
stimulate their innovation capacity and consolidate their
positioning and performance in the various market segments;

— manage Dooya as an independent entity, in partnership with the
minority shareholder to enable it to develop separately,
particularly at international level, and adapt as effectively as
possible to its own competitive environment.

In this way, the Group intends to revitalise and consolidate the

foundation of its main brand, Somfy, while securing Dooya’s

MMM 620)< M S118S/ ),1$1&,$/ 5(3257

position and thus preserve the value of its investment in the

ZK ¢oMpany.

At the end of June 2018, new rules of governance have been
adopted for this purpose without involving any changes to the
capital structure but consolidating the minority shareholder’s role
with joint control over the company. Pursuant to IFRS 10 and 11,
these changes resulted in Dooya being excluded from full
consolidation and its consolidation under the equity accounting
method at its fair value as determined by an independent expert.
Dooya is deemed to be a Cash Generating Unit of material
significance within the Group by virtue of its size and standing on
both the Chinese and export markets. It is also the only Group
entity operating under the Dooya brand. For this reason and given
the change in governance detailed above, it meets the IFRS 5
criteria for classification as “Discontinued Operations”. The Group
has replaced the term “Discontinued Operations” with the term
“Operations treated in accordance with IFRS 5” throughout this
annual financial report, terminology that is more appropriate to
the transaction.

Pursuant to IFRS 5, the 2017 consolidated income statement and
cash flow statement have been restated to enable periods to be
compared.

The impacts of the change in consolidation method are detailed in
note 2.4 to the consolidated financial statements.

held a 61% interest, and which — given the governance established
— was recognised ] the equity method at an amount of BRL

taken control of Neocontrol, in which it now holds 100% of the
capital, and now fully consolidates the company.

amount of the earnouts and their maturity. They resulted in a

€9.7 million goodwill impairment was recorded. The two impacts

The dispute between “ ] employees and “}u(° “Ns still
ongoing before the Chambéry Court of Appeal. The employees
seek annulment of the transfer of the Spirel securities, which took
place in 2010, and to have Somfy SA ordered to pay them damages
for the alleged deliberate bankruptcy of Spirel and non-material
damage caused as a result of the anxiety, disappointment and
vexation they deem to have been victim of, for a total of
approximately €8.2 million. In April 2017, the Court ruled in favour
of Somfy SA, dismissing the employees’ claims. However, the
plaintiffs immediately appealed this decision. Proceedings are still
underway and a resolution is expected during 2019.

>> K W dln Bddition, during 2016 the liquidator of the company Spirel also

sought to have Somfy SA ordered to refund advances of €2.9
million paid by the AGS (Guarantee Fund for the Payment of Salary
Claims) in the event the disposal was declared null and void.

Initial proceedings before the Labour Court — involving the
employees contesting the grounds for their dismissal and claiming
damages of a substantially similar amount to that sought before
the Court of Appeals — were dismissed in November 2016. The
employees applied to the Albertville Labour Court once again in
early July 2017 and these applications were also rejected in 2018.
These factors do not alter the Group’s risk evaluation. Therefore, it
continues to qualify these risks as contingent liabilities and no
provision was recognised in relation to these disputes at
31 December 2018.

On S5January 2015, *}u(’ “transferred its 46.1% direct and
indirect equity investment in the share capital of CIAT Group to

Fec ofogies<CBrporation filed a claim against the sellers of the
CIAT shares under the liability guarantee for a total of €28.6 million
(Somfy’s share being €13.2 million). The Group considers these
requests to be unfounded, and insufficiently detailed and justified.
In mid-November 2017, UTC brought an action against the sellers
before the Paris Commercial Court for the liability guarantee.
Proceedings before the Commercial Court and the Court of
Appeals are ongoing.

As the process and documentation provided by UTC currently
stand, the Group continues to contest the entirety of UTC’s
demands and remains confident regarding the outcome of this
dispute. It has qualified the risk as a contingent liability and no
provision was recognised at 31 December 2018.

At 31 December 2018, Somfy SA’s financial statements include a
receivable for deferred settlement in relation to the sale of the
CIAT shares for the sum of €9.7 million with payment spread until
2019. In early July 2017, Somfy SA and the other sellers brought an
action against UTC before the Paris Commercial Court seeking the
fulfilment of the acquisition contract and the settlement of the
deferred payments falling due. These proceedings are still ongoing.
Somfy SA remains confident regarding the settlement of these
sums and therefore no writedown in relation to these receivables
was recognised at 31 December 2018.

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

W ZEd KDW Ez d

Over the year ended 31 December 2018, Somfy SA generated sales
of €3.4 million. Net financial income amounted to €101.4 million,
including €105.6 million in dividends paid by the subsidiaries in
respect of their net profit for the year to 31 December 2017.

Group sales were €1,126.7 million over the year just ended, an
increase of 3.4% after the restatement resulting from the change
in the consolidation method of Dooya and 5.2% on a like-for-like
basis.

This performance was achieved after strong growth in the previous
financial year. It reflects both the strong performance of historical
markets, such as Benelux, France, the United Kingdom and
Scandinavia, and the momentum of new markets, such as India,
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Russia.

The sales of the now _ equity-accounted Dooya totalled
€178.0 million, an increase of 9.4% in real terms and 12.0% on a
like-for-like basis.

The current operating result for the financial year stood at €177.8
million, up 1.8% based on a like-for-like consolidation method,
equating to 15.8% of sales in spite of adverse foreign exchange
effects costing €10.6 million. It would have totalled €189.1 million,
up 8.2% and equating to 16.5% of sales ona like-for-like basis.

This 50-basis point increase in the current operating margin on a
like-for-like basis was the result of business growth and an
improvement in the gross profit margin driven by healthy sales
prices, and higher raw materials costs offset by productivity gains.
At the same time, overheads increased due to continued
investment in research and development and participation in
major industry events (the CES trade show in Las Vegas and R+T in
Stuttgart).

Net profit fell 11.0% to €140.4 million. It takes into account a
significant negative balance of non-recurring operating expenses
and income, primarily due to costs associated with the termination
of a project in China, and an automatic increase in the income tax
charge given the tax reliefs of €22.3 million recorded over the
previous financial year.

OUTLOOK

The home motors and automation market remains structurally buoyant as a result of growing consumer demand for comfort and security,
and growing public awareness of energy and environmental challenges. A short-term slowdown cannot however be ruled out, on account

of economic uncertainties and geopolitical risks throughout the world.

The investment effort will be maintained, and even intensified should the context allow it, to enable the Group to consolidate its base and
its leadership. It will specifically focus on product innovation, streamlining information systems, with the rollout of an ERP over the course

of the year, and digitalising organisations and processes.

The policy of developing partnerships with complementary players and the opening up of new ecosystems and protocols (ZigBee network)
will also be pursued. This will form part of the commitment to offering “integrated” solutions based on proprietary protocols, while
simultaneously continuing to digitalise the historical activities, and will help position the Group as an industry standard for the connected

home.

The company has implemented several successive share buyback
programmes. The most recent buyback programme was launched
in 2018; it was authorised by the Combined General Meeting of
16 May 2018 in its 11" resolution, sitting in ordinary session, and
had the following objectives:

— to stimulate the secondary market or ensure the liquidity of the
Somfy share, by way of an investment services provider within a
liquidity contract that complies with the Ethics Charter of AMAFI
recognised by regulations, it being specified that within this
framework the number of shares considered for the calculation
of the limit specified above corresponds to the number of shares
purchased less the number of shares resold;

— to retain the shares purchased and subsequently exchange them
or use them as payment within the framework of potential
acquisitions;

— to ensure the coverage of stock option plans and/or free share
allocation plans (or similar) granted to employees and/or
corporate officers of the Group, as well as all other shares
allocated under a company or group savings scheme (or similar),
in relation to employee profit sharing and/or any other form of
allocation to employees and/or corporate officers of the Group;

— to cover marketable securities giving right to the allocation of
company shares, in accordance with applicable regulations;

— to proceed with the possible cancellation of shares acquired, in
accordance with the authorisation granted or to be granted by
the Extraordinary General Meeting.

Such share purchases could be effected by all means, including by

means of acquiring blocks of shares and at any times considered

appropriate by the Management Board.

The company reserved the right to use options or derivative

instruments, in accordance with applicable regulations.

The maximum purchase price was set at €130 per share, with the

maximum amount of the share buyback programme set at

€135,334,290, taking account of the 2,658,967 treasury shares

held at 31 December 2017.

j sDuring the financial year just ended, on the basis of the
authorisation given by the General Meetings of 2017 and 2018, the
company bought back 152,896 shares at an average price of
€79.60, sold 146,505 shares at an average price of €81.77 and
transferred 8,525 shares at an average price of €24.03 for final
vesting of performance shares granted free of charge on
21 February 2014.

All of the 152,896 shares acquired were allocated to the liquidity
objective.

2018, representing 7.18% of the share capital; the value of the

purchase price of one share amounted to €37.36 for a par value of

Midway through the Believe & ACT! strategic plan, R&D initiatives
have yielded results and have made real progress in all the areas of
growth identified in the plan, as well as in our core business. These
initiatives continue to focus on methods and equipment to
promote innovation.

In 2018, our R&D initiatives to connect our entire core business
and gain recognition as an industry standard for automation and
the connectivity of opening and closing systems in homes and
buildings were recognised at two trade shows of significance to the
Group: in January at the CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in Las
Vegas, and in March at R+T, the trade fair for our industry
(Shutters, Blinds, Doors & Gates), which takes place every three
years in Stuttgart.

CES 2018 proved a success for Somfy. When it set up its display at
the CES in Las Vegas, Somfy had a clear ambition — to position itself
as a key player in the Smart Home and Internet-of-Things (loT).
Mission accomplished. Somfy’s 180 m? booth, at the heart of the
Smart Home space, attracted crowds of visitors, including the
French Secretary of State for Digital Affairs, Mounir Majhoubi.
American customers discovered our new Zigbee bi-directional
(open protocol) motors and Somfy’s vision for the Smart Home in
three areas: Home Protect, Home Climate and Home Ambiance.
French specialist superstores (Boulanger, Leroy Merlin, etc.) were
particularly interested in the Home Protect security range. This
showcased the Group’s latest connected innovations: a connected
outdoor camera, a connected thermostat (launched in 2017) and a
connected door lock. The trade fair gave us the opportunity to talk
to people about our expansion strategy, So Open, launched in
2017, and to mention Somfy’s expansion into four areas: protocols,
ecosystems, the TaHoma gateway and our APIs (Application
Programming Interfaces). These allow third parties to interact with
Somfy applications and create new solutions using their own
applications. Partners we were delighted to welcome at our booth
included Schneider, Legrand, Google and Alliance Zigbee, etc.
Somfy enjoyed very good media coverage particularly in highly
influential American and French media, such as CNET, Digital
Trends, O1net and Les Numériques, amongst many others.

The R+T 2018 trade fair was attended by more than 60,000 visitors
from more than 125 countries. It is the leading trade fair for
market innovation, acting as a barometer of the activity in our
business lines and offering an ideal forum for exchange for the
Somfy brand and its customers, whom we welcomed at an 840 m?
stand with five separate areas for sales presentations: Home
Ambiance, an immersive display of our new product range in
connected interior blinds and curtains; Home Protect: security
innovations including an openwork rolling shutter motor, our new
outdoor camera and the Home Keeper professional alarm; Home
Climate: devices for energy efficiency and air quality with a new
connected thermostat, window-opening motor and a new
building-management system, animeo Connect; Home Access: new
access management equipment (motorised garage doors and
gates, connected door locks, connected video door phone, etc.);
and, finally, Somfy With You: our brand services ecosystem. The
Group’s other brands were also represented at R+T 2018 with their
own stands and innovations.

Another achievement of 2018 involving all R&D teams and
departments was the introduction of a professional network to
promote the Group’s technological expertise. The “Somfy Tech
Program”, launched in June 2018, aims to strengthen the internal
network of technological capabilities. This initiative allows us to
identify technological fields that are strategic for Somfy, identify
the necessary resources for these fields and identify relevant
expert employees. This offers a new way of promoting the
competences of these employees and increasing their visibility
within the company. It also gives us time to nurture and expand
their expertise with a view to maintaining, and even increasing, the
technical expertise of other employees working in R&D through
expert support and training. On 14 June, 16 employees were
promoted to the rank of Expert. This programme will enable us to
safeguard those strategic areas in which we face competitive
challenges. The selection of these areas and programme
co-ordination is entrusted to an Expert Committee which identifies
relevant experts for each area.

The other major R&D-related achievement affecting all areas of
the Group is the rollout of a centralised database to manage the
technical specifications of our products: MDM or Master Data
Management, launched in June 2018. One of its objectives is to
increase the reliability of the launch process. In the medium term,
the MDM will be closely coupled with the future ERP (Enterprise
Resource Planning) solution selected by Somfy, with a view to
eliminating multiple data entries and corrections. MDM
foreshadows the rollout of a unified product information
management (PIM) solution, scheduled for delivery in 2019 to feed
our business systems.

The Innovation Department supports the operational teams,
helping them formulate their vision for the future and identify
drivers for innovation. It also supports them on their first project
resulting from this new vision. The Innovation team organises
workshops for groups of employees, using a method primarily
focused on consumers and their usage patterns.

Since 2016, the Innovation Department has organised My Somfy
Lab, a collaborative creation platform, based on a prospective
network within the company. It has a quarterly publication,
“Explore”. It hosts a group on Yammer, the company’s social
network, and Open Cafés to disseminate good practices and
research findings.

In April 2018, the Innovation Department, in partnership with the
development teams, inaugurated a 75 m? FabLab (Fabrication
Laboratory) called the “Yeti Lab” at the Cluses R&D Centre. This
laboratory allows teams to produce a prototype of their project
using its equipment (3D printer, laser cutting, etc.) and methods.
Its aim? To be able to move quickly from an idea to a prototype, to
turn the idea into a physical object with a view to assessing its
feasibility, potential uses, etc. It promotes collaborative work over
short timescales aiming to generate momentum for the project.
The FabLab also offers workshops and training and is targeted at
all employees.
04

At the end of the year, the Innovation Department also launched a
new initiative, IDEAS CONTEST, allowing employees all over the
world to participate in our innovation programmes and put
forward their own ideas; and, if successful, potentially see them
come to fruition as prototypes developed in the FabLab. This
initiative seeks to strengthen the company’s flow of ideas and
innovation and supports the patent process through PPI (Patent a
Product Idea) sheets.

Somfy consistently invests in intellectual property and particularly
in patents. At the end of 2018, its portfolio contained 2,153
patents or patent applications. In 2018, 40 new inventions were
registered with the INPI (France’s National Industrial Property
Institute), a figure in line with previous years. Somfy routinely and
consistently protects its innovations, making it one of the leading
French patent applicants.

The Group also supports its brands and increasingly seeks to
prosecute companies which try to use names which are similar or
identical to its own. It takes this action systematically, against
brands, domain names or commercial websites.

The Intellectual Property and _ Technological Innovation
Department is co-founder of the Somfy Tech Program initiative.

Cross-company collaboration on methodological issues concerning
software development, to guarantee the interoperability of
different solutions and anticipate data flow between both
embedded and cloud-based products and services, is still a key
driver for the continued improvement of our teams. Notably, the
Technical Department is continuing to work to introduce standards
development within the Group to improve agility and continued
service improvement, with a further rollout of the Engineering
System that was first deployed in 2017 on the Modules principle.
This is essential for an understanding of complex systems, from
modelling to maintenance, for purposes of software design and
also for mechanical systems.

The Technical Department has continued to develop and deliver a
complete portfolio of technological building blocks with two main
objectives: next stage connectivity and energy-efficient electrical
motors.

The Technical Department acted as project manager in the
introduction of the Somfy Tech Program initiative.

In 2018, operations grew with staffing levels remaining stable at
around 45 engineers and technicians in mechanical design,
electronics development and project management. Synergies with
the development teams, based in Cluses, are now fully operational.
The number of new projects rose from 22 in 2017 to 33 in 2018.
Teams in Cluses and Nanxun launched new ranges of wirefree
motorisation for interior blinds. These new tubular motors
dedicated to residential markets clearly outstrip those of our
competitors in terms of performance and autonomy. Our range of
motorised curtains has also been overhauled in order to better
address the needs of the global market and more specifically Asia
and the Middle East. The new “ultra-quiet” Glydea generation of
motors has been on the market since September 2018. The new
Movelite range of motors, designed as an entry-level product, has
been available since December 2018. Development of connected

facilitating multi-brand approaches amongst the Group’s customer
base. In the field of home automation, WAY collaborated with
Overkiz to produce a home box using ASA brand RTW protocol
which allows ASA radio motors to be remote-controlled in
applications for rolling shutters, awnings and screens. Finally, WAY
launched a new motor designed to open windows, produced in
three different models to meet different market needs in terms of
power and technical specifications.

The Connected Solutions business has upgraded its organisation to
affirm its positioning in the security and residential access control
market in Europe. Since 1 October, the new Security Business
Group (BG) has brought together teams from Cluses and Rumilly,
from Somfy and its subsidiary Domis, and those of Labeége
(Toulouse), from the acquisition in 2016 of Myfox. The aim is to
acquire the resources they need to consolidate and develop the
positions they have achieved in a highly competitive sector, and
thus ensure the long-term success of this fast-growing business.
Security, which complements Somfy’s core business, is set to be a
valuable addition to the Group’s historical product ranges. It is also
set to accelerate the use of short channels and allow us to win new
customers. Among other advantages, the Security BG uses a
collaborative R&D approach of the design thinking type, where the
product design and the constant improvement of these products
through upgrades are grounded in an iterative process, based on
feedback from sales teams, customers, consumers, journalists, etc.
This user-centred approach is made possible by Agile project
management — a product development method from the digital
world that the BG has tailored to its own industrial environment.
This overall approach also applies to production and procurement.
The Rumilly manufacturing facility, managed within the BG and
dedicated to Connected Solutions, was certified as an “Industry
Showcase of the Future” by the Future Industry Alliance in
November. It helps to bring connected objects designed and
manufactured in a 4.0 connected factory to connected consumers.
The first product to date to have emerged from this combined
approach is the Home Keeper alarm, launched in October. Through
connectivity, it combines a professional-typed product, with an
Installer application for easy installation and maintenance on the
one hand, and on the other hand the Somfy Protect application's
same quality of user experience and security services.

The new V300 video-phone, designed both for installers and
private individuals, was released in the summer of 2018. This
video-phone, a core product, benefits from plug & play design (it is
easy both to install and use). It thus addresses a real need to
secure access, not only for French consumers but also for those in
Southern and Eastern Europe.

The highly anticipated Outdoor Camera, our new CES
award-winning outdoor camera, was released in October: it is the
most dissuasive on the market, allowing, thanks to the integrated
110 dB siren and the triggering of the lighting system, to prevent a
burglary attempt before it takes place.

Furthermore, within the Connected Solutions Activity, Overkiz, the
Group subsidiary which manages the TaHoma infrastructure and
also works for other customers providing bespoke solutions, has
joined forces with the Smart Home BG to drive forward the
customisation of our connected range for customers and, in
particular, to design for them environments which combine
Somfy-connected products with those of other brands. This
project, Sokiz, has allowed Somfy to move from a
customer/supplier relationship to a position as expert in connected
devices serving customers, while supporting the development of
Somfy's motors and equipment sales. With this project, the Group
offers a flexible range of products whose size is unique to the
marketplace. It has considerable potential as it is targeted at
real-estate developers, service providers, telecommunications
companies, energy providers and major players in the building
industry. This project has been launched at a time of strong growth
in demand for connected homes, not only in France but also in
Europe and beyond, particularly in Asia where the concept of
condominiums (serviced apartments) entirely justifies the
installation of connected equipment.

In May 2018, our Connected Solutions Activity opened “So Open
with Somfy”, a dedicated European platform which provides
companies and developers with free access to our APIs (Application
Programming Interfaces). Somfy connected products are now open
to any developer who wishes to include our solutions in their
applications. The provision of our APIs is being rolled out gradually:
automation for rolling shutters, thermostats, etc.

Launch, in June, of TaHoma DIN Rail, Somfy’s latest home
automation box designed for new housing. It enjoyed an early
success in Poland with Polish real-estate developer Echo: more
than 4,500 apartments, including around 100 in 2019, are to be
equipped with the Somfy ecosystem (connected thermostat, Izimo
lighting micro-modules, etc.) connected with TaHoma DIN Rail.
This new modular box which offers Zwave, RTS and io, EnOcean,
Wi-Fi (and Zigbee in the course of 2019) protocoles is built into the
electrical panel and can be installed very easily by electricians
through a dedicated application that can be accessed without prior
internet connection. This success parallels that of the first
partnership in Europe in the area of collective housing with French
market leader Nexity.

Twenty-three motors were launched in 2018 for the interior solar
protections, an unprecedented volume of development in this
segment. Similar numbers have been planned for 2019.
In the residential segment, we have focused on reliable, quiet,
connectable and autonomous solutions using embedded batteries.
This broad range is designed to meet the different uses and
technical standards found throughout the world.
Other developments seek to build a medium-term competitive
advantage. That is the case of two current pilot projects. The first,
Huna, is a blind solution focusing on the simplification of user
experience from purchase to maintenance. The second, Mornin’+,
allows manual curtains to be motorised without having to change
the installed device.

In 2018, Somfy invested in the development of a new
communication platform for the control of interior and exterior
blinds in commercial buildings, preparing for the widespread use of
the Internet in IPv6 format. The R&D teams have successfully met
the challenge of developing a new communication protocol,
operating on two different media: Ethernet and RS485 (with
several patents at stake). This new platform, which has been
tested on two buildings at our Cluses site, the R&D Center and the
LightHouse, will be launched on the market in 2019 and will be
open, scalable and remotely accessible, it will enable all Somfy
digital motors (wired - SDN- and radio - io- technology) to be
controlled, providing numerous benefits for occupants, owners
and technical building managers.

Launch of the Bioclimatic Pergola, a tiny “ecosystem” which
includes control of lighting, heating, and the pergola’s roof and
walls. It strengthens Somfy’s position in a rapidly changing market.
In Europe today, consumers want fully automated pergolas that
are user friendly. That is why, over the last six months, Somfy has
launched several product lines based on a control unit and the
io-homecontrol protocol. Outside of Europe, Somfy is also
adapting to the American market. With its leading position in the
external screen market, Somfy has a major advantage in this
market. Since late 2017, Somfy has been marketing a new motor in
the United States, the Maestria RTS, designed for a zipscreen
(external screen sealed with a type of zip). Its strength is obstacle
detection. Zip Screen is completely suitable for the walls of this
type of pergola.

As regards the Access Activity, Somfy brand’s major release is the
new Smart-io platform, a solution fully connected in native mode
and designed to control standard motorised garage doors and
gates. This range uses Set&Go and Serv-e-go (tools which allow
installers to connect to their customers’ products and easily adjust
settings and carry out maintenance) enabling installers to program
the product in 90 seconds and also to offer a remote maintenance
service and remote diagnostics. Furthermore, Smart-io gives end
users access to a comprehensive ecosystem to improve and enrich
their connected experience with video-phones, exterior cameras
and lighting. Different uses include, for example: welcome home;
secure your home in a single click; check your home; unexpected
delivery.

BFT launched three new ranges in 2018. The Botticelli range of
motors for garage doors was upgraded. It now has new
specifications to simplify installation and operation |] a built-in

control unit with self-learning of opening and closing forces. The
Virgo gate operator can now be remote controlled from a
smartphone J] a U-Link solution. A new directional (180°)
Compacta photoelectric cell was also released. In addition, the
U-Control solution and associated B-EBA Wi-Fi card (used, for
example, in the Virgo gate operator), already on the market, was
identified as the best innovation in its “low current” category out
of 29 selected innovations and was an award winner in the
Innovation Trophies section at the 2018 Sidec trade fair.

O&O, another BFT subsidiary, has developed its range of traffic
applications with its new Maxima Ultra 36 barrier, the first of a
new range specifically designed for traffic, parking and toll-charge
applications, and more resilient retractable and static bollards —
the Ranch E bollard and the B10mm Pillar.

the emphasis on local dynamic, while drawing on the Group’s
global strength.

Somfy’s organisation is not set in stone. It is flexible and adapts to
the Group’s strategic challenges and the development of its
markets. The Group is organised around human-scale operational
units (geographical business units, activities business units, brands,
industrial sites, etc.). They are grouped into management entities
(Business & Marketing Areas, Activities, etc.). These operational
units and management entities rely on cross-company functions.

as many levers as possible to put forward and implement their
strategy, to allow them the freedom to give their best and
promote excellence within their scope. They develop know-how
and specific skills which are used for value creation.

They are founded on the basic principle of subsidiarity. Powers are
delegated to the operational units enabling them to take decisions
that affect them. Transparency, performance and cooperation are
expected in return.

Cross-company functions ensure the smooth operation of the

Group. As part of their mission, they ensure:

— compliance with the principles of
governance;

— that processes are managed and continuous improvement is
driven forward;

— that business lines are developed and upskilled.

They act as genuine partners to the management entities and

operational units, develop on-field knowledge and are key players

in creating value through their expertise. They have the resources

and skills needed by the business lines for which they are

responsible. They apply the subsidiarity principle. The Group can

decide, for reasons of expertise or economies of scale, to pool

resources.

This diversity has two consequences. The first is that our markets are globalised on account of the size of the main players in this market and
yet very local as they depend on the uses of a particular building and construction methods. The second is the relative overlapping of different
categories of products and the option for the Group to combine its brands and product lines in order to develop the capacity to propose
solutions to customers that include offers from all of its business lines.

For that reason, geography is used by the Group to assess its performance. It provides a better account of the dynamics that underpin our
markets: the dynamism of the construction and renovation market, the momentum of distribution channels, and changes in occupant uses.

A description of the activity performance by geographical area can be found on page 16 of this report.

The resolutely human strategic driver “Better Together” puts
societal responsibility drivers at the heart of value creation with,
amongst other things, the #CSR booster (Corporate Social
Responsibility). “Better Together” contributes to employee
commitment and serves the long-term interests of the Group and
its stakeholders. This helps the implementation of Sustainable
Development drivers in the Group’s strategy and operations.

In relation to the “Better Together” driver, the main levers of the
Group’s entities are to ensure the professional and personal
development of all employees, improve their working environment
and minimise the environmental impact of all activities, sites and
products, and to accept their civic responsibility by becoming
involved in social issues that are consistent with their lines of
business.

These levers are progressively strengthened through an approach
based on continuous improvement measured by indicators, the
introduction of a dialogue with all stakeholders, and regular and
transparent communication.

The Steering Committee for Sustainable Development brings
together the Sustainable Development Director, the Group Human
Resources Director, the Group Communications Director, the
Director of the Foundation”, the Group Purchasing Director, and
the Director of Internal Audit and Chair of the Ethics Committee.
Its mission is to ensure the coherent implementation of the four
pillars of Somfy’s Sustainable Development strategy: Planet,
People, Society, Customers and the pillar common to all: Ethics.
Somfy has a Sustainable Development Department which, since
2017, has been attached to the Strategic Marketing Department.
Its missions are to guide the implementation of the Group’s
environmental commitments. The organisation as a whole and the
teams within the Group also contribute to the continuous
improvement of the Sustainable Development policy.

Social commitment to sustainable development and increasing attention paid to increasingly high expectations on the part of stakeholders
is not merely an option for businesses but a necessity. For Somfy, it is above all a priority and a lever which allows it to fulfil more
comprehensively its vision of the aspiration of everyone and their families to enjoy a healthy, eco-friendly way of living. It also allows it to
build on its model of profitable and sustainable growth. This commitment allows it to improve its non-financial performance by adding
meaning to changes it implements, by promoting employee engagement and focusing their energy on common goals, and by enhancing the
value of its brands and the quality of its relationship with its customers and consumers and, more generally, with all its stakeholders. The
challenges raised by corporate responsibility to all stakeholders include both risks and opportunities. The most important of these are listed
in the table below, which refers to different sections of the Non-Financial Performance Statement where policies implemented to address

these challenges are listed. These risks were identified within the framework of the Sustainable Development Steering Committee, on the
basis of the ISO 9004 standard, Managing for the Sustained Success of an Organisation — A Quality Management Approach. A materiality
matrix is currently being developed to complement this approach.

Human capital is an important element of our business model. The ability to attract the right skills and required expertise and to retain and
develop talent and skills within the company is a strategic priority for the Group. The professional development of employees is critical to
their engagement, which in turn drives innovation and performance and is therefore a key growth driver. The Group’s appeal and our
employees’ engagement are linked to the professional development we offer and also to the respect they are given through the health and
safety, and more generally the working conditions we provide. In 2018, Somfy’s biennial commitment survey had a 1] ]}v

X_ ,&high score that demonstrates the deep commitment of employees.
These priorities appear in the Believe & ACT! strategic roadmap in the “Better Together” driver, and more specifically in the implementation
of the #EmployeeJourney booster.
This booster relates to the quality of HR processes at all stages in the working lives of Somfy employees: the way we attract applicants, the
way that the company supports its employees by taking care of safety, working conditions and working environment, how it improves skills
and allows employees to reach their full potential and how it develops people at work. After describing the stages of this process and
identifying key milestones and associated HR processes which take account of the challenges mentioned above, the #EmployeeJourney
roadmap was validated and included by Group entities in the implementation of our strategy.

Information was collected for 2018 and 2017, which enabled data and their variations to be compared on a constant group structure basis
throughout the analysis. As such, 2017 data has been restated (in comparison with the 2017 published data) to incorporate the change in

the consolidation method of the Dooya legal entity.

At 31 December 2018, total Group workforce excluding temporary workers was 5,677 people, compared with 5,725 in 2017 (restated for

the Dooya entity), a decrease of 0.84%, and was analysed as follows:

Group sustainability depends on its capacity to recruit the new
skills it needs and to develop its employees on a daily basis to
respond to new business and organisational models arising from
the digital transformation of companies.

It is also important for employees who so wish to be able to
transfer to other lines of business or positions which are consistent
with their career plans and the needs of the company. The same
applies to Somfy’s ability to retain recognised skills and to the
employability of its employees. For these purposes, processes
shared throughout the Group are rolled out.

The company continued its effort to ensure that the skills of Group
employees are matched with the organisation’s needs, to attract
new skills, ensure the employability of staff and prepare
tomorrow’s generation of managers.

Over the 2018 financial year, the workforce grew 0.23%, going from 5,170 to 5,182 employees.

87% of the increase in the workforce is shared between France, Germany and Eastern and Central Europe, mainly in the Somfy distribution
subsidiary in the Czech Republic, Overkiz in France and the Somfy distribution subsidiary in Germany.

91% of the decrease in the workforce relates to the Asia-Pacific region, mainly at Lian Da (China).

management targeting their operational teams and_ using
dedicated communications channels such as flyers. Consequently,
frequency rates improved significantly both at industrial sites and

Work related accidents and occupational diseases are monitored,

to country (HSWCC in France for example).

In the case of Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs), steps were taken
at the Somfy Activités SA legal entity: manual handling and
ergonomics training, workstation ergonomics, job rotation in

Somfy is an industrial company whose products are installed in
buildings. The analysis of environmental challenges therefore
focused on two aspects: the effects of industrial activities and
challenges related to global warming from a dual perspective: the
reduction of associated risk by reducing the carbon footprint of its
activities and the opportunity that this offers Somfy in terms of
developing its market.

Industrial sites mainly perform product assembly operations from
plastic and metallic components and circuit boards sourced from
outside the sites. Assembly operations do not product gas
emissions, liquid releases or substance discharges, with the
exception of packing waste and possible manufacturing scrap
which are subject to selective sorting and recovery.

There are no machine operations generating waste material.

There are no heat or heat treatment processes likely to consume
considerable amounts of energy. Energy consumption linked to the
production process only accounts for 30% of all energy consumed
at industrial sites.

Water consumption at the sites is limited to the toilet facilities. At
Somfy’s various industrial sites, there are no manufacturing
processes likely to exhaust local water resources or that depend on
a limited water supply.

There is no specific noise pollution generated by the industrial sites
affecting local residents. Indeed, operations are situated inside
buildings and mainly consist of the assembly of small parts.

There are no mining operations on any Somfy’s sites.

The different sites are subject to classification levels compliant
with local regulations in relation to pollution or nuisance risks that
these facilities are likely to create.

The French sites are subject to an authorisation scheme for storage
in covered warehouses and a registration scheme for compression
and accumulators for recharging fork-lift trucks installations.

There are no facilities that correspond to the maximum level,
“Authorisation with encumbrances - (AS)3” commonly known as
“SEVESO”.

}v o J}v Jv Z vy }¢ J] ] U }

For these reasons, the risk of air, soil, water and noise pollution is
low or non-existent. Nor is there any identifiable risk attributable
to the management of production waste or water consumption.
Nevertheless, the consumption of water and energy and

report does not therefore provide any information on these
subjects.

In relation to these risks of pollution or nuisance that Somfy
Group’s sites are likely to create and the preventive measures
introduced, the amount of provisions and guarantees for
environmental risks is nil.

Given this low level of environmental risk on these sites, there are
no specific resources deployed. The measures introduced are
managed by the Facilities Departments of the sites.

Worldwide, buildings account for approximately 40% of
greenhouse gas generation. By promoting the smart control of
opening and closing systems in homes and buildings, Somfy helps
to redudé their energy consumption, by acting on light levels and
by reducing needs for heating and air conditioning. Thus, Somfy
solutions improve the energy efficiency of the buildings in which
they are installed. Somfy is therefore particularly aware of the
challenge of global warming and it addresses this through
continuously improving the energy efficiency of its products and
through the contribution they can make to the reduction of the
energy consumption of buildings. Global warming therefore offers
a growth opportunity to Somfy. This opportunity is addressed in
particular in its Believe & ACT! strategy through the “Bolder on the
Interior markets” strategic driver and its aspect on the
development of project business offers for office and vertical
residential buildings. It is also addressed in the “Better Together”
strategic driver and its CSR aspect as specified below.

As global warming is a risk acknowledged by all and one that
affects everyone, Somfy is also committed to reducing its carbon
footprint whenever it makes sense to do so.

WK>/ /EdZK h “WwW Zd K& d, AZ KK*d Z
As part of the CSR booster which contributes to the “Better
Together” strategic driver, Somfy has introduced a global policy
which offers a sustainable approach to the environmental
dimension of its actions. This approach, “We Act for Green”,
recognises the contribution made by our solutions to reducing the
energy consumption of buildings as a growth driver for the
company. It also recognises the need to have a coherent plan of
action for our carbon footprint in respect of all our products and
processes if we are to be consistent with our core purpose: “A
better way of living accessible to all”.

Consideration of sustainable development challenges is clearly in

line with our corporate purpose: “Inspiring a better way of living
accgss)ble to all”. But it also relates to addressing the potential risk

for Somfy of communicating about climate change challenges and
making them a driver of growth for the Group without ensuring
consistency between a product promising an environmental
benefit and our behaviour in relation to environmental challenges

in the manufacturing and distribution cycles of these products.

That is why energy efficiency and climate change are Somfy’s main
environmental priorities.

The “We Act for Green” programme was launched in 2018. It

reflects the environmental policy that Somfy has adopted as a

consequence of the risks and opportunities mentioned above.

“We Act for Green” rests on three pillars:

1- “Green Buildings’: Somfy products and solutions enable
buildings to reduce their energy consumption;

2- “Green products”: Somfy products and solutions are
eco-designed in accordance with our “Act for Green®”
framework;

3- “Green teams”: Somfy products are developed, manufactured

and distributed by teams who introduce environmentally

friendly practices to their workplaces.
In order to implement this policy, Somfy has set up a Sustainable

Solar protection systems motorised and automated by the
solutions offered by Somfy help to reduce the energy consumption
of buildings. This is achieved both by reducing the winter heat loss
of buildings and by protecting them from the heat in summer,

E KZ’ E/* dth&réby improving comfort in the summer and helping to reduce

the installed air conditioning capacity.

Somfy is a member of the Active House Alliance, which promotes
healthier, more comfortable buildings that do not have a negative
impact on the climate”),

In this context, animeo Connect, our range of controls for fully
connected solar protection, was awarded the “Solar Impulse
Efficient Solution” label”) by the Solar Impulse Foundation. This
solution considerably enhances opportunities for energy

Products are awarded an Act for Green® label when they meet
eco-design requirements.

Act for Green® can be traced back to the results of a Carbon
Assessment® carried out in 2012". This Carbon Assessment® had
established work on electricity consumption and the use of raw
materials as priorities.

This eco-design approach, launched in 2015, was continued in
2018 with the certification of new products:

Act for Green® is based on a framework taken into account by

Research & Development teams. It incorporates requirements that

are broken down according to several subject areas:

— controlling greenhouse gas emissions through moderate
electricity use and the choice of appropriate raw materials;

— seeking to use recycled and recyclable raw materials in the
composition of products;

— materials selected for their low impact on health and the
environment;

— product durability;

— a statement of the environmental impacts in line with the PEP
ecopassport® programme in which Somfy participates. This
programme, developed by the electricity industry, defines a
standardised method for making environmental declarations in
accordance with international regulations (ISO 14025 & ISO
14040s). The information contained in this PEP ecopassport®
has been independently verified by Bureau Veritas CODDE.

A roadmap for the integration of projects in the Act for Green®

programme had been drafted in collaboration with development

Requests, both customer and regulatory, in relation to
understanding the substances used in our products have
continued. Somfy is monitoring the progress and implementation
of these regulations by taking part in the FIEEC’s'? “GT Substances”

In Europe, end-of-life products are collected and processed under
the WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) Directive.
These collection and processing are organised by environmental
organisations with which Somfy has contracts in different countries

Somfy employees, inspired to do something for the environment
as much on account of their own personal values as those of the
Group, have stepped up their good practices.

Through these actions, Somfy encourages the development,
replication and sharing of these good practices and, in 2018,
inaugurated an international network of eco-ambassadors. These
eco-ambassadors are responsible for deploying environmentally
friendly practices within their working groups.

Although Somfy solutions help lower the overall carbon impact of
buildings, the Group is also committed to reducing the impact of
its activities on global warming. Somfy relies on the results of a
Carbon Assessment® to identify the significant sources of
greenhouse gases emitted as a result of company operations, in
particular due to the use of the goods and services it manufactures
This Carbon Assessment® carried out across scopes 1, 2 and 3 and
within the scope of Somfy SAS, now Somfy Activités SA, helped to
rank the different causes of greenhouse gas emissions by order of
importance. This assessment was carried out with the support of
the Eco2 Initiative.

The electricity consuming items of products (consumption/usage)
and raw materials (inputs) between them accounted for 85% of
greenhouse gas emissions by Somfy SAS in 2011. These two items
relate to products manufactured and thus to the activity of the
industrial sites. Given that the nature of the activity of the
industrial sites and the types of products manufactured are
identical and have not changed since 2011, this Somfy SAS Carbon
Assessment® is representative of all the Group’s industrial sites.
The emissions of the different items are proportional to the
activity of each industrial site. The ranking by order of importance
of greenhouse gas emissions is therefore deemed to be the same
between 2011 and 2018 and across all sites.

Quantities manufactured by Somfy SAS accounted for 25% of all
quantities manufactured by the Group in 2011.

This led to the establishment of the Act for Green® programme,
described in the “General Environmental Policy” chapter. As this
programme is being applied progressively to all products and
markets, it is leading to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
across all production sites.

However, other items, such as transport or energy consumption,
have not been neglected, with mobility programmes at Somfy SAS,
now Somfy Activités SA, and initiatives to reduce energy
consumption at the sites.

In 2018, Somfy continued to implement measures to reduce the
environmental impact of its sites:
— at Somfy Activités SA (France):

At the start of 2017, the Arve Valley, a region covered by an

Atmospheric Protection Plan, and in which most of Somfy’s

French sites are located, was hit by an exceptional air pollution

incident. Somfy thus focused on measures to help reduce this

pollution by seeking to influence the means of transport used
for commuting to and from work.

This led to the introduction of the following actions:

e Somfy is a founding member of G.R.E.EN (Groupement pour
la Responsabilité Environnementale des Entreprises — French
association for corporate environmental responsibility). This
organisation brings together companies and _ local
government authorities from the Haute-Savoie and Pays du
Mont-Blanc region to promote initiatives that encourage the
sustainable development of companies in the Arve Valley and

E. zthg Haute-Savoie département.

E Within the context of G.R.E.EN, the first project implemented
was a car-sharing application specifically aimed at home to
work travel. This KLAXIT application (formerly WAYs up)
completes Mov’ici, the official platform for commuting to
and from work organised by the Auvergne-Rhéne-Alpes
region which is also available to our employees;

@ continuation of a mileage allowance for cycling. One hundred
people declared 53,241 km and 13 people have donated this
money to the Somfy Foundation;

e the introduction of charging points for electric vehicles which
started in 2017 is continuing on our sites. Nine employees
have registered to use the two charging points for their own
vehicles (cars or bicycles), three other service and company
cars also use them;

e@ gradual introduction of hybrid vehicles and petrol as a
replacement for diesel in the company vehicle fleet. Seven
out of ten self-service company cars now run on petrol;

e a “Mobility Challenge” day aimed at changing commuting
practices was held again in 2018 with 30% of employees
present taking part, and more than 5,782 km travelled that
was not driven solo;

@ communication: in order to raise awareness of eco-mobility
among employees, an internal site has been created, bringing
together all the relevant information on air pollution, related
in-house initiatives, the various sustainable forms of
transport and testimonials.

Affirmative action in favour of organic food at the company

Reuse of IT hardware: 508 products handled in 2018 including
281 computers. The update and removal of computer data is
performed by a company promoting the employment of
disabled people. These computers and various accessories are
then reused, thereby breathing new life into them. In 2018, 59%
of the equipment was reusable, with the remaining 41% sent for
recycling.

Following on from the energy audits conducted in 2015 on our
sites in the Arve Valley in France, work was carried out to reduce
the energy consumption of the buildings in 2018. It mainly
sought to improve insulation, introduce solar protection
systems, modernise heating and compressed-air production
systems and introduce automated LED lighting systems
throughout the sites;

— similarly, the Simu site in Gray in France replaced an old boiler
by three separate condensing boilers allowing it to better
regulate gas consumption to meet the individual needs of the
administrative buildings;

— initiatives were introduced at the Lian Da site in China in the
areas of waste sorting and energy and water savings. All
production workers have received training on waste sorting. A
storage facility was built to house hazardous waste;

— the SOPEM factory in Poland has an environmental policy based
on the following areas:
© conserving natural resources,
© contributing to sustainable development,
© cooperating with partners for environmental protection,

e@ improving energy efficiency.
SOPEM introduced a waste sorting training course for 500
employees;

— in Italy, BFT has an ISO 14001 certified structure. In 2017, BFT
prioritised its actions to reduce the standby power consumption
of its products and to reduce the use of non-recyclable
packaging. Emphasis was also placed on managing hazardous
waste such as oil and electronic components. This was
undertaken through in-house meetings and _— general
communications with staff;

— in 2018, the SITEM plant in Tunisia engaged an environmental
health and safety officer.

Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the use of raw materials
that form part of the composition of the products are also taken
into account:

— analyses of the lifecycles of products conducted on the control
points highlight that it is the microprocessor that generates the
largest portion of emissions, accounting for over 25%. By way of
example, the Act for Green® criteria recommend the use of
QFN type microprocessors which, in comparison with the
QFP” versions prohibited by Act for Green® generate a five-fold
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions;

— research has also been conducted into the use of recycled
plastics. However, the plastic materials used in Electrical and
Electronic Equipment (EEE) must meet very high specifications
and standards in relation to fire testing and dielectric properties
(notably CEI 335-1, UL 746 C). These materials are not currently
available on the recycled plastics market. Somfy is supporting
the economy-focused work of the FIEEC”) to make progress in
this field.

Somfy is committed to improving the living conditions of all, and
the company’s foundation was established in 2004 to support this
worthwhile cause. Since then, it has pursued its civic action to
combat poor housing and to help people live together better.

The Somfy Foundation is a lever that enables Somfy to respond to
the high expectations of external and internal stakeholders that
there should be consistency between what the company says
about improving living environments and its day-to-day actions.
The reality and relevance of this policy can be tracked using a
single indicator: Z vu }(C jo] Joffered ‘by Group
employees to further the work of the Foundation. This indicator is
clear evidence of the number of subscribers and the fit between
corporate social responsibility and employee expectations. It also
sends a message to other stakeholders that there is strong
commitment on the part of the employees, above and beyond any
financial investment made by the Group to assume this
responsibility. In 2018, « Jo] ] ‘weré donated to the
Foundation by employees.

The Foundation is now a philanthropic organisation in its own
right, both in terms of financial and human contributions. Both
initiatives are implemented through the international programme
A House is A Home and the crowdfunding programme Les Petites
Pierres.

In 2018, Somfy gave the Foundation’s initiatives €350,000, and
provided an operational team of six people.

The same goals lie at the heart of both the A House is A Home and
Les Petites Pierres programmes: steadily forging the bonds of
humanity that form the basis of a balanced society, developing
lasting relationships, and working hand-in-hand with community
partners identified as stakeholders and project leaders. This helps
promote the values of solidarity within the company.

The endowment fund Les Petites Pierres is a digital crowdfunding
platform initiated by the Somfy Foundation. It enables anyone to
donate to community projects in the area of access to decent

housing, with every donation by an individual being matched (] X X

doubled) by the Somfy Foundation and other partner companies.
In 2017, faced with the strong development potential of the
crowdfunding approach and ever-increasing challenges in the fight
against poor housing, the Somfy Foundation decided to open the
Les Petites Pierres endowment fund to allow contributions from
other sponsors willing to support and develop the platform’s
activities to be included. This enabled Les Petites Pierres, in a spirit
of co-construction, to welcome on Board the Schneider Electric
Foundation and the BTP Plus Foundation. For 2018, the Somfy
Foundation granted funding of €152,218 to Les Petites Pierres
endowment fund, including an employer donation of €145,000. In
the 2018 financial year, 65 non-profit projects were financially
supported by Les Petites Pierres endowment fund of a total of
€751,194 awarded to non-profit organisations. In the course of the
2018 financial year, the symbolic milestones of €2 million
collected, 11,000 donations and 200 projects financed on Les
Petites Pierres platform since it was created were reached.

In addition to project funding, non-profit organisations receive
assistance with digital skills learning, thereby helping them to

leverage their various communities and other partners
independently.

It is important to promote citizen engagement in those countries in
which the Group has a presence and consequently the Somfy
Foundation operates internationally. A House is A Home was
launched in January 2015. Through this programme, Somfy
subsidiaries work alongside the Somfy Foundation. In consultation
with the Foundation, subsidiaries identify projects which promote
decent living conditions for the most underprivileged, and provide
financial support, often topped up by skill-based patronage from
their workers. In 2018, seven projects received financial support in
collaboration with Somfy subsidiaries.

Through its  socially-responsible commitment, the Somfy
Foundation gives real substance to the values of responsibility,
openness and respect of the company. The A House is A Home
programme was consolidated in 2017 with the introduction of
human philanthropy in certain subsidiaries in addition to the
financial support provided.

In order to promote regional development, the Group helps to
support higher education and research in the
Auvergne-Rhéne-Alpes region, in part thanks to its role as a
founding member of the Université Savoie Mont Blanc (USMB)
Foundation alongside the Assemblée des Pays de Savoie (regional
government) and the Université Savoie Mont Blanc Club des
Entreprises (Business Club). This selection forms part of the
longstanding relationship between the University and Somfy,
which has continued since the creation in 1991 of the Club des
Entreprises. Somfy is working alongside the University to bring the
academic world closer to the business world. As such, as part of
this Business Club, the University has links to help identify
opportunities for its students who are seeking professional training
contracts. This helps them forge strong links with local training and
generates a talent pool for the company. This can be seen in
particular in Somfy’s presence at “work-placement job dating”
events and on work placement events organised by the Business
Club. It can also be seen in its presence on the Boards of Directors
of training organisations and particularly on the Board of the

located. These associations, boosted by the economic action of the
Auvergne-Rhéne-Alpes region, have more wide-ranging and
deeper effects thereby laying the ground for national or European
initiatives with selected partners in the future. These
collaborations enable the company to be committed to enhancing
the attractiveness of the local area whilst continuing to benefit
from the input of skills and innovations into its design and
industrialisation processes. The ecosystems that it includes also
enable interaction and sharing between all Somfy’s regional

The Group annually reviews its communication plan in relation to
its stakeholders, to ensure they are kept regularly informed and to
facilitate as much as possible constructive discussions in relation to
the Group’s strategy and management with the stakeholders
identified as priorities: employees, shareholders, investors,
customers, users, suppliers and regional governments.

In 2017, the first edition of Investor Day took place in Paris in front
of an audience of economic journalists and financial analysts,
during which the Group’s strategy was presented by the Group
CEO and other members of the Executive Committee.

We distinguish between customers, a term that refers to the
professionals or distributors who buy and sell, integrate, or install
our products; and users, a term that refers to the end users of our
products, whether they are the customers of our customers, users
of our solutions in offices or communal facilities, or consumers
buying our products on our websites. Being responsive to
professional customers is a strategic priority for the Group and it is
structured within a programme called “Customer First”. For each
customer profile, the Group has developed dialogue-based
activities — studies, surveys, training, services — tailored to the
expectations of these stakeholders. Our quality survey helped to
achieve a Net Promoter Score of 57 out of 100, which is a good
result. The survey also enabled us to identify areas requiring
improvement.

Users are regularly consulted as part of the development of our
new offers. A forum moderated by Somfy gives them a voice in
France. Other users can thus answer questions, and so can
company employees. To date, more than 40,000 questions were
therefore asked | this means and the number of visitors reached
190,000 per month. This total number of 58,000 participants since
the launch of the forum in 2013 enables our hotline to be more
efficient and to answer calls more quickly and has led to
productivity gains in this telephone support service. Somfy’s
consumer information websites were used by 10,338,882 unique
visitors in 2018.

Involved in the development of the areas in which the Group is
located, Somfy has led dialogue in France with the various levels of
public decision-making to contribute to action in the areas of
education, employment, research and development, or to support
cultural and sporting projects for local people, by trying where
possible to replicate these events within the company for the
benefit of employees. These cultural and sporting programmes
include meetings at the Pays du Mont-Blanc (Pays du Mont-Blanc),
Plein Feux Festival (Bonneville), MB Race (Pays du Mont-Blanc),
and various sports clubs (Cluses). This collaboration can take the
form of patronage or sponsorship, since the visibility of Somfy’s
initiatives by Group employees or local residents is one of the aims
of this commitment.

Suppliers and sub-contracting are important for the Group due to
the nature of its industrial activity which is essentially assembly.
Indeed, all the components that form part of the composition of
the products are purchased components. In this respect, the Group
has redefined its procurement policy with a particular focus on
corporate social and environmental responsibility. This policy is
reflected in the new contractual framework with a view to
deploying our own CSR commitments in the upstream supply
chain: in employment, the environment, fair practices and
combating corruption, conflict minerals and hazardous substances.
To respect its commitments, the Group has launched a supplier
risk-management approach covering the following topics:
geopolitical risks and corruption, combating modern slavery,
environmental impacts of supplier processes and has mapped the
risks at between 1-low risk to 4-high risk.
The Group seeks to introduce suitable due diligence and control
for potentially risky procurements. The indicator will therefore be
the amount of procurement classified as high risk. It also
undertakes to select suppliers on the basis of criteria that are both
clear and shared from the consultation phase onwards. In 2018,
the use of a Sourcing Committee to select suppliers was therefore
extended. For every component developed by a supplier, the
Group requests a written undertaking relating to the European
Directives REACH and ROHS. /v U 19 }( Z }

Ethics is a cross-company driver of the CSR booster contributing to

The Group therefore wants to maintain the requirement for
exemplary behaviour on a day-to-day basis. As such, the Ethics
Charter is intended to serve as a point of reference in terms of
individual and collective behaviour and will guide our day-to-day
activities enabling us to embody our values. It is a common and
unifying document, which guides us in our decision-making; a tool
for the promotion of dialogue between employees so that ethics is
an open matter understood by all.

Somfy and its employees particularly seek to respect the
regulations of the countries in which it operates in relation to
organisation of work, whilst subscribing to the principles and
objectives of the fundamental conventions of the International
Labour Organisation (ILO) and by aiming to adopt the practices of a
responsible and management respectful of everyone. A role of the
network of HR Officers is to ensure the respect of Human Rights,
particularly examining within their scope rights and concerns
relating to racial discrimination, torture, enforced disappearances,
disabled people and the rights of women, children, migrants,
minorities and indigenous peoples.

This is reflected in a commitment to:

— respect differences, improve diversity and reject discrimination;

— reject any kind of harassment, notably mental and sexual;

— ensure the health, safety and decent working conditions for the
company’s employees and partners;

— seek to develop the skills and employability of staff and their
professional development;

— reject any kind of illegal child labour and the use of forced
labour;

— guarantee constructive social dialogue;

— reject any kind of corruption, whether active or passive.

In addition to this Ethics Charter and following the enactment of
the law on transparency, the fight against corruption and the
modernisation of the economy”), Somfy has chosen to adopt the
Middlenext Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct. This Code of
Conduct is designed to guide business behaviour. The Group has
decided to supplement it with several appendices in order to
provide practical advice, examples and links to other procedures.
In addition to these documents, e-learning materials are currently
being rolled out and face-to-face training has also been introduced
for those employees expected to be the most exposed. /v

The Non-Financial Performance Statement was drafted using the
reporting protocol introduced for the RSE 2018 reporting in
accordance with Article L. 225-102-1 of the Commercial Code (the
“Grenelle 2” decree).

Z WKZd/E’ WZKdkK K>

The Groups’ CSR reporting protocol is the reference guide for all
those involved in CSR reporting within the Group. It is drawn up in
French and English. Its purpose is to define all the Group’s CSR
indicators along with their method of calculation, and to describe
the procedures for their collection and for reporting in order to
promote the consistency and comparability of data. This document
is distributed to and applied at all levels of data reporting. The
reporting protocol is updated annually to take into account Group
developments.
The CSR reporting protocol also serves as a reference framework
for the external verification of data, in accordance with
Article L.225-102-1 of the Commercial Code. It is available on
request from Head Office.
‘> d/KE K& /E/ dKZ%*
The Group’s indicators were defined by the CSR officers for each
area in line with the Group’s CSR strategy and the resulting social,
environmental and societal objectives. They address the main
challenges (risks and opportunities) inherent in the Group’s activity
and_ illustrate, through clear communication, the Group’s
non-financial performance and the policies it has introduced to
address these challenges, while at the same time supporting the
CSR approach in each of the progress drivers identified by the
Group.

The data collected covers the period from 1 January to

31 December 2018.

Depending on the indicators, it can relate to:

— an annual consolidation of the data from 1 January 2018 to
31 December 2018;

— the data measured at 31 December 2018.

Where historical information is available, data is reported on the

Pursuant to Article L.225-102-1 of the Commercial Code,
companies which are controlled by the Group and_ fully
consolidated within the financial reporting scope are included
within the reporting scope. The concept of control means the
power to govern the financial and operational policies of an
affiliated company so as to benefit from its operations. Control is
generally deemed to exist where the Group holds more than half
of the controlled company’s voting rights.

For reasons of organisation and access to information, not all
Group companies have yet been included. The Group wants to use
perimeters that are more relevant depending on the topics
covered. As such, certain companies are excluded from the social
scope due to the existence of very low workforces in certain
organisations (distribution subsidiaries spread out over vast
geographic areas such as South America), or the lack of Human
Resources information systems designed for collecting data easily.
However, the Group integrates all significant companies that it
fully owns.

Newly acquired companies are integrated into the reporting scope
following a probationary period necessary for the introduction of
reporting. Companies which were sold during the financial year are
not included within the reporting scope.

Following changes in control and governance at the Chinese
subsidiary Dooya, which has left the full consolidation scope and is
now consolidated using the equity method, Dooya is no longer part
of the CSR scope.

&/E E/ > Z/*<*

The main financial risks to which the Group is exposed are foreign
exchange, interest rate, liquidity, investment and raw material
risks.

According to IFRS, all derivative financial instruments are
measured at their fair value. Fair value is either the market value
for listed instruments, or a value provided by financial institutions
in accordance with traditional criteria (over-the-counter market).
The amounts covered exclusively relate to current or future
transactions within the framework of the Group’s normal business
activities.

As part of the transposition of the MIF Directive that came into
force on 1 November 2007, Somfy SA and its French subsidiaries
opted for the “individual clients” category.

&KZ/’E y, E’ Z/*<

The Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily related
to its operational activities (intragroup sales of manufactured
products distributed by commercial subsidiaries outside the Euro
zone, these sales being denominated in local currencies and
purchases denominated in local currencies).

At comparable terms and conditions, the Group gives priority to
natural hedges (foreign currency purchases related to sales in the
same currency). The derivative financial instruments put into place
are forward foreign exchange contracts for the main currencies.
The management of foreign exchange risk is covered in note 7.3 to
the consolidated financial statements.

/Ed Z%d Zd Z/*<

The Group is exposed to interest rate risks. Management of the
interest rate relative to Group debt is based on consolidated
position and market conditions. The primary objective of the rate
risk management policy is to control Group financing costs.

The management of the interest rate risk is covered in note 7.3 to
the consolidated financial statements.

>/Yh/ /dz Z/*<

The Group must have permanent access to the necessary financial

resources to allow it to finance its day-to-day activities and its

investments. The Group’s liquidity risk primarily arises from the

obligation to repay its existing debt, the funding of its future

requirements and observance of its financial ratios.

The granting of credit facilities is subject to Somfy SA’s

commitments to its banking partners to comply with two types of

financial covenants based on:

— the Group’s financial structure (net financial debt/shareholder’s
equity); and

— its ability to repay (net financial debt/EBITDA).

The management of liquidity risk is covered in note 7.3 to the

consolidated financial statements.

Credit facilities and compliance with covenants are detailed in note

7.2.2.6 to the consolidated financial statements.

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is related to its cash surplus
deposited with banks.

The management of credit risk is covered in note 7.3 to the

The Group is exposed to fluctuations in the price of the raw
materials used in the manufacture of its products (copper and zinc
in particular).

To maintain its profitability, the Group must be able to cover for or
offset this risk or pass it on to its customers. It has, however,
introduced procedures designed to limit its exposure to risks
associated with changes in the prices of raw materials.

The management of raw material risks is covered in note 7.3 to the
consolidated financial statements.

The Group is exposed to equity risk on treasury shares. Given the

The Group’s operations are not subject to specific regulations. Its
activities do not require specific legal or regulatory authorisation.
The Group is involved in a number of disputes in respect of its
business. These should not have any significant negative impact on
the Group’s financial position.
To the Group’s knowledge, there were no exceptional events or

The Group covers the main risks with the following insurance

policies:

— “Property damage”, covering buildings and their contents in all

locations (equipment, goods, IT equipment) as well as resulting
monetary and operational losses.
The events insured are,as_ uJ] v]u, fire, explosions, lightning,
smoke, emissions, steam, impacts from airborne objects, vehicle
collisions electrical risks, storms, hurricanes, cyclones, snow,
hail, water damage, frost, machine breakage, computer risks,
malicious acts, acts of vandalism, riots, popular movements and
IT equipment theft, natural disasters, except where local
circumstances make this impossible;

— “General civil liability relating to monetary consequences of an
insured entity’s liability following physical injury, property
damage or moral prejudice caused to a third party during or in
relation to its operations”;

— “Corporate officers’ civil liability”;

— “Transported goods”.

In addition, credit insurance contracts, both in France and

internationally, mitigate the consequences of customer default.

Approximately 85% of sales are covered by such contracts.

The majority of operations occur in safe areas such as Europe and

The regions most exposed to current economic, geopolitical and
monetary uncertainties are China, Latin America and the Middle

Due to the nature of the products marketed (notably motors for

conditions, in particular during the first half of the year, during
which sales of motors for blinds are concentrated.

As part of its industrial activities, the Group is exposed to a certain
number of risks attributable to climate conditions (storms,

The preparation of the budget is part of an annual strategic
process involving all the Activities, Business Areas and Business
Units, as well as all the Divisions, which define their own key
objectives, in line with the strategic guidelines set by General
Management.
The overall budget is prepared as part of an iterative process
involving all Group players. It is the result of the consolidation of
local budgets.
After approval by the General Management of the Group, every
manager becomes responsible for meeting his/her own budget.
The measurement of the achievement of objectives set out in the
budgets is carried out through a system of matrix reporting on a
monthly and quarterly basis, which enables results to be produced
on several axes (Business Area, Business Unit and Activity). It
comprises the standard financial data: operating accounts and
balance sheet indicators, and non-financial performance indicators.
Reporting is complemented by strategic reports and quarterly
updates of forecast sales and profit for the current year. These
measurements enable a follow-up of the achievement of
objectives and provide corrective actions on a matrix basis and at
all levels of responsibility (consolidation, Business Areas, Business
Units, Activities, Legal Companies, Departments and Services).
In addition, three three-year plans, in line with Group strategy and
revised annually, are overseen by Management. They include:
— a PSMP (Products and Solutions Master Plan) which relates to
the development of the range of products and solutions;
— an industrial and logistics master plan for production facilities;
— amaster plan for information systems.

The Group has defined a unique and common framework for the
recording of accounting and financial information.

It resulted in the definition and implementation within all
subsidiaries of a Group chart of accounts, as well as the definition
and implementation of the main management procedures
(inventories, non-current assets, trade receivables, etc.), which are
formalised in the Group Procedure Manual relayed through and
updated on the Group’s intranet.

The proper application of the chart of accounts, procedures and
reporting reliability is monitored by visits to subsidiaries, planned
within the context of year-end and half-year closing. It is also
verified during the budget preparation and monthly reporting
processes.

The Group team responsible for the development and control of
financial statements comprises:

— the consolidation team;

— the central financial control team.

This team relies on financial controllers, based in each Business
Area, reporting to the Group in its ten geographical areas.

In addition, each of the Activities benefits from at least one
dedicated financial controller.

The Group endeavours to lead this network J] international
meetings and on-going training of accountants and _ financial
controllers.

Particular care is taken with risk analysis, through a review of asset
provisions and provisions for liabilities and charges, as well as
off-balance sheet commitments.

At each year-end, inventories are verified either through a
complete physical stock-take or by a rolling physical stocktaking
procedure.

04

Trade receivables are the subject of credit risk analyses with
respect to the measurement of provisions. In addition, the
company hedges the majority of its risk by entering into customer
credit insurance contracts, both in France and abroad.

Intragroup purchases, sales and balance sheet items are confirmed
monthly.

Inventory amounts originating from the Group are determined in
all entities in order to eliminate internal profit margins on
inventories.

A pre-closing meeting is organised each half-year with the Legal
Department to identify all liabilities and possible or stated
litigation and to calculate, with reference to the progress of cases,
corresponding provisions for liabilities and charges.

The review of various contracts, deposits, sureties and guarantees
also serves to identify off-balance sheet commitments.

The consolidation packages, including: balance sheet, income
statement, cash flow tables and related data, are then sent to the
Consolidation Department according to a predefined planning
schedule.

&/E E/ > ddD Ed%*

KEdZK>

The Consolidation Department, after verifying the completeness of
financial information, the proper application of closing procedures
and restatements, performing the intragroup account
reconciliations and verifying the net equity justification, performs
financial statement consolidation using dedicated software.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with IFRS. In addition, accounting options selected are presented
to and approved by the Audit Committee.

Following their approval by the Supervisory Board, the half-year
and full-year financial statements are presented to the financial
community under the auspices of the SFAF (French financial
analyst society) and published in a report posted on the financial
issuer’s website (www.somfyfinance.com) as well as] a primary
information provider (www.lesechos-comfi.fr).

The other regulated information referred to in Article 221-1 of the
AMF’s general regulations is also available on both these sites.

is presented to the Audit Committee.

For the companies that have an ERP (BaaN or Accpac) installed,
standard parameters are included (comprising a chart of accounts,
analytical follow-up and procedures).

A new ERP for the Group is being selected.

Completion of the budget, monthly reporting, margin analysis by

The Group Treasury Department reports to the Group Chief
Financial Officer.

The Group Treasury Department is responsible for carrying out
transactions in cash management, financing and managing risks of
a financial or banking nature, and providing technical support to

subsidiaries’ cross-company functions, in connection with the

Group’s operations.

It has a duty to warn the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Treasury

Committee or the Management Board of developments in the

relevant markets and the fair assessment of risks.

A Treasury Committee meeting is held each month, chaired by the

Group’s Treasurer, to review:

— deposits;

— funding;

— the Group’s net debt;

— off-balance sheet banking commitments;

— foreign exchange positions;

— amacroeconomic review of the market;

— the Group’s cash and debt positions (current and forecast);

— miscellaneous items: ongoing acquisitions, follow up of late
payments, guaranties/securities, Group loans;

— miscellaneous projects (cash pooling, optimisation of cash
management systems...);

— the Group’s net financial income/(expense) (twice annually).

This Committee comprises the following members:

— the Group CFO;

— the Group Treasurer;

— members of the Group Treasury Department.

Members of the Management Board are ~r}(( ]mémbers and

have a standing invitation to Committee meetings.

The role of the Treasury Committee is twofold:

— strategic: to define the overall policy in terms of Group Cash
Management, financing, and interest rate, exchange rate and
investment risk management. They also include the follow-up of
Group subsidiaries’ equity balance sheet items;

— operational: to guarantee the regular monitoring of Group Cash
Management’s actions. These are detailed in a monthly trend
chart.

The rules and procedures relating to the Group’s Cash

Management have been formalised in the Cash Management

Charter, which covers the following:

— ethics;

— liquidity/exchange rate/interest rate risk;

— deposit of excess cash;

— counterparty risk;

— governance.

This Charter was subject to a quality review in the second half of

2017.

In addition, a Group Treasury Charter has been in place since

1 November 2013. It defines best practices and list in a single

document the guidelines that ensure the secure, economical and

efficient management of financing and deposit operations, and
more generally of cash management and bank relations within the

Group.

This Group Treasury Charter is applicable to all subsidiaries

controlled directly or indirectly by Somfy SA and specifies their

roles and responsibilities regarding the management of their
financing, deposits, banking flows and more broadly speaking their
cash management transactions.

The two international multi-currency cash pooling projects were

finalised with HSBC in 2016 for APAC and BNP Paribas for North

America and Europe. The Eurozone cash pooling project was

finalised at the end of 2017.

representatives responsible for leading internal control at local
level.

MMM 620)< M $1188/_—_—+), 181 &,$/ 5(3257 T

The internal control function coordinates management actions,

ensuring the following:

— compliance with laws and regulations;

— the application of the instructions and guidelines set by the
Management Board;

— the smooth running of the Group’s processes and operations,
notably those that help safeguard its assets and prevent fraud;

— the reliability of reporting (both financial and non-financial).

Members of the Internal Control Committee meet every month to

discuss the latest audit reports issued and other matters, such as

year-end visits or training programmes to be provided to financial

controllers, or ongoing projects.

In order to fulfil its coordinating and monitoring role, in 2017 the

Department implemented a dedicated GRC (Governance Risk

Compliance) tool, specifically:

— to initiate a self-assessment campaign for subsidiaries each year,
including a framework of key controls;

— to monitor all the tasks of Internal Audit, as well as the related
recommendations and the corresponding action plans;

— to assess the Group’s risks, at several levels (BU, BA/BG,
BMA/Activities), to consolidate the results at Group level and to
link them with action plans.

The use of all these resources is closely monitored by the Audit

Committee, which is regularly informed of the progress achieved

and the results obtained.

A quarterly reporting process has also been established for the

benefit of the Group Executive Committee and the managers of all

subsidiaries in relation to the progress of action plans and the
resolution of weaknesses that have been identified.

Certain improvements are directly addressed by entities at a local

level, while others are looked into centrally by the Internal Control

Department and/or in collaboration with other cross-Group

functions.

Lastly, the Internal Control Department is also responsible for the

centralised monitoring of risks and the update of risk mapping, in

collaboration with the Internal Audit Department specifically in
relation to the methodology.

A share buyback plan for a period of 18 months will be submitted
for your approval. This plan would replace the current programme,
which would be terminated early. It would allow management to
purchase up to 10% of the shares of the company, if necessary
restated for any potential capital increase or decrease transactions
that may be carried out over the timeframe of the programme.

The objectives of this programme would be:

— to stimulate the secondary market or ensure the liquidity of the
Somfy share, by way of an investment services provider within a
liquidity contract that complies with practices recognised by
regulations, it being specified that within this framework the
number of shares considered for the calculation of the limit
specified above corresponds to the number of shares purchased
less the number of shares resold;

— to retain the shares purchased and subsequently exchange them
or use them as payment within the framework of potential
acquisitions;

— to ensure the coverage of stock option plans and/or free share
allocation plans (or similar) granted to employees and/or
corporate officers of the Group, as well as all other shares
allocated under a company or group savings scheme (or similar),
in relation to employee profit-sharing and/or any other form of
allocation to employees and/or corporate officers of the Group;

— to cover marketable securities giving right to the allocation of
company shares, in accordance with applicable regulations;

— to proceed with the possible cancellation of shares acquired,
subject to the authorisation granted by the General Meeting of
shareholders of 16 May 2018 in its 12 resolution, sitting in
extraordinary session.

We propose to set the maximum purchase price at €130 per share.

set at €135,611,710.

You will be asked to grant the Management Board an authorisation

to allocate, in one or more instalments, in accordance with Articles

L.225-197-1 and L. 225-197-2 of the Commercial Code, existing
d ordinary shares of the company, for the benefit of:

related to it within the meaning of Article L.225-197-2 of the
C9 mergiql Code;
— and/or corporate officers meeting the conditions set forth by
Article L. 225-197-1 of the Commercial Code.
The total number of free shares thus allocated may not exceed
1.5% of the share capital at the date of the Meeting, it being
specified that from this limit would be deducted the total number
of shares to which the options that may be awarded by the
Management Board under the authorisation granted by the Annual
General Meeting of shareholders of 16 May 2018 in its 13"
extraordinary resolution may give rise.
The allocation of shares to beneficiaries would be definitive at the
end of a vesting period whose duration, which may not be less
than one year, would be set by the Management Board.
Beneficiaries should, where applicable, retain these shares for a
minimum period, set by the Management Board, at least equal to
that required to ensure that the cumulative duration of the
vesting, and where necessary the retention, periods may not be
less than two years.
The Management Board shall have the necessary powers, with the
option of subdelegating within legal limits, to set the other
conditions and procedures pursuant to which the shares are
allocated and, where applicable, do anything, within the context of
applicable legislation that the implementation of this authorisation
requires.
We propose setting the duration of this authorisation at 38 months
from the date of this Meeting.
This new authorisation would terminate in advance the existing
authorisation with the same purpose.

Your Management Board asks you to approve the above
resolutions submitted to your vote.
