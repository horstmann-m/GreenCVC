GROUP PRINCIPLES

Business Model, Targets and
Strategies

adesso is a fast growing IT services company which
has set its sights on becoming one of the leading con-
sulting and technology groups for industry-specific
business processes in Central Europe. With a high
level of expertise in the areas it caters to, adesso oper-
ates at the interface between business processes and
IT, implementing software projects at the highest
technical level By developing its own software solu-
tions, adesso increases its market penetration, carv-
ing outa prominent position in IT topics of the future
such as mobilisation or enterprise content manage-
ment. adesso pursues the internationalisation of its
own product sales as a strategic goal. Enterprise devel-
opment is complemented by a well-defined acquisi-
tion strategy.

Fuelled by past growth and growth in the making,
a focused business model and an insistence on out-
performing industry average margins, the company’s
value is continually being enhanced. adesso puts sig-
nificant resources in targeted business development,
the expansion of sales capacities, recruiting and mar-
keting. These investments, coupled with extensive
industry and consulting expertise, enable growth
rates which exceed the industry average by far. adesso
is a leading technology company in the field of soft-
ware development which invests more than average
in the training and development of its workforce and
in the ongoing development of its own model for the
software development process.

The Executive Board is committed to a strategy of
striving for the right balance of growth, solid finances
and profitability.

For 2014, the Executive Board set sales growth tar-
gets well above the market average of 6 % to 9 % of
between EUR 144 million and EUR 148 million,
higher operating earnings, measured as EBITDA, of
between EUR 8.5 million and EUR 9.0 million, and
an increase in the EBITDA margin to more than 6.0 %.
All targets were met and exceeded.

The Supervisory Board appointed a new member
to the Executive Board on 1 April 2015 in order to
maintain the pace of growth while continuing the
strategy of intensively involving the Executive Board
in business operations.

Employees and Structure

Founded in 1997, adesso had a total of 1,377
employees (FTE) in Germany, Austria, Switzerland,
England, Turkey, and the USA at the end of 2014.
While the adesso Group employs 141 (previous
year: 115) staff outside of Germany, 882 (previous
year: 768) employees are deployed in Germany and
work for the parent company, adesso AG, which
represents the largest operating unit in addition
to the holding company. adesso AG’s largest loca-
tion is Dortmund, which is also the city in which
the company was founded and where its corporate
headquarters are located. To stay close to its custom-
ers and keep travel costs as low as possible, adesso
maintains eight other offices in all of Germany’s
major economic regions. Worldwide locations are
Boston, Istanbul, London, Vienna and Zurich. The
newest location in Jena with a focus on e-commerce
business models was opened in 2014.

In addition to adesso AG, the largest operating unit
and parent company, the Group also includes major-
ity-owned companies, consolidated subsidiaries of
subsidiaries, a joint venture company and a minor-
ity interest as of the reporting date. adesso has two
different segments: IT Services and IT Solutions.
While the IT Services segment offers customised,
project-oriented services in the areas of consulting
and software development, the IT Solutions busi-
nesses market their own solutions in the shape of
home-grown products or standard software prod-
ucts. The company is publicly traded and listed
on nearly all German stock exchanges (ISIN code:
DE000A0Z23Q5, WKN [national security identi-
fication number]: AOZ23Q).

Management System

adesso AG spearheads adesso Group and defines the
strategy and operational targets of all group compa-
nies. It controls the legally independent group com-
panies by implementing a target system, an ongoing
reporting process and by occupying positions in the
supervisory bodies. Operational control is ensured
by a reporting system which has been implemented
group-wide. In the process, each group company
prepares full monthly financial statements based on
national legal regulations. Key performance indica-
tors featured in the reports are sales, EBITDA, pre-tax
earnings (EBT), EBT margin, number and proportion
of employees not operating at full capacity, headcount
and net liquidity. The most important performance
indicators are subject to continuous comparisons
with plan and actual data. All indicators are carried
forward and subject to an internal group benchmark.
An updated rolling forecast will be created for the
full year in order to detect possible deviations for
each group company early on. Fixed reporting chan-
nels and cycles have been defined and there is also a
fixed appointment schedule for management meet-
ings. There are no fundamental differences between
key performance indicators in the reporting systems
for each segment.

Research and Development

The bulk of adesso’s turnover is generated through its
sales in IT services. With few exceptions, adesso solu-
tions represent the core of project solutions which
are then tailored to customer requirements in client-
specific projects. Research expenses in IT Solutions
segmentare negligible in relation to group expenses.
None of the group companies has its own dedicated
research department.

ECONOMIC REPORT

Macroeconomic Climate and
Industry-specific Conditions

Macroeconomic Climate

Economic growth in Germany accelerated in 2014
for the first time since 2010. After very moderate
growth of 0.1 % in gross domestic product during the
previous year, 1.6 % growth was achieved in 2014.
Developments varied during the year even though
the German economy proved stable overall on aver-
age. After economic output actually decreased in the
second quarter and only moderate positive growth
was achieved in the third quarter, the German fed-
eral government scaled back its economic forecast for
the entire year significantly in the autumn by 0.6 per-
centage points to 1.2 %. Uncertainty has increased in
Germany as well in view of geopolitical crises, and the
economic expectations were affected by the moder-
ate development of the world economy with increas-
ingly uncertain sales opportunities. A recovery
commenced in the final months of the year, driven
by high employment levels and strong consump-
tion. The weaker euro boosted exports and lower oil
prices caused real incomes to rise. Incoming orders,
sales and industrial production increased in the final
quarter.

Accordingly, the German economy was able to per-
form well ina challenging global economic environ-
ment in 2014. As in previous years, high employ-
ment levels and private consumption proved
themselves as stabilising factors. Investments in
equipment and buildings along with foreign trade
provided additional impulses. The German federal
government expects the economic recovery started
in the final quarter of 2014 to initially continue in
2015. Its annual projection for 2015 calls for 1.5%
GDP growth during the year.

Solid GDP growth of 1.8 % was achieved in Switzer-
Jand during 2014 as well. On the other hand, the eco-
nomic recovery failed to meet expectations in Austria
with GDP growth between 0.3 % and 0.4 % in 2014.

Industry-specific Conditions

According to investigations carried out by the BIT-
KOM industry association, the German IT prod-
ucts and services market expanded by 4.3 % to
EUR 77.8 billion in 2014. Momentum increased
again for the first time since 2010, and in fact nearly
doubled compared to the previous year. In relation to
overall economic development, the IT market devel-
oped almost three times as fast. After losing some
momentum in the previous year, the software seg-
ment grew by 0.6 percentage points to 5.6 % and
reached a market volume of EUR 19.1 billion in 2014.
adesso’s sales in its key IT Services segment grew by
1.0 percentage points over the previous year to 2.7 %.
The market volume of this segment now amounts to
EUR 36.3 billion. Industry-specific conditions there-
fore continued to be positive for adesso’s business
performance.

Business Performance

There were no individual events that could be seen
as having significantly affected the business perfor-
mance in the reporting period.

Overall Statement on Business Performance by
the Management

The adesso Group was able to improve sales and oper-
ating earnings by 16 % and 26 % year on year respec-
tively, achieving its 2014 targets in those key figures.
The goal to increase the EBITDA margin to more than
6.0 % was also reached with 6.2 %. Requirements for
further market penetration were met in the USA. An
important milestone in setting up the future business
area adesso insurance solutions was reached with
the recruitment of a pilot customer for the develop-
ment of additional industry products in health and
property insurance. Pre-tax earnings increased from
EUR 4.6 million to EUR 7.3 million. On this basis,
the Executive Board has proposed to increase the divi-
dend by 19 % to EUR 0.25 per share.

Growth in Sales

In financial year 2014, adesso increased its sales
from EUR 135.3 million to EUR 156.9 million,
which amounted to sales growth of 16 %. All of this
growth was organic by expanding the existing busi-
ness activities and growing the service and prod-
uct portfolio, without acquisitions. With market
growth of 2.7 % for the industry, adesso once again
had significantly higher organic growth than the
market as it did in previous years, and was therefore
able to gain market share.

During the year, sales revenues increased from
EUR 74.6 million in the first six months to anew
high of EUR 82.4 million in the second half of the
year. The increase is due to the higher number of
potential working days, a further increase in the
number of employees and higher licence sales. Even
though much higher sales were generated in 2014
by developing alternative business models, such
as settlement by the number of transactions or the
number of claims processed, the total remains below
EUR 1 million.

In the IT Services segment, the adesso subsidiary
in Germany was able to significantly increase sales

by 16 %. Switzerland generated 16 % year-on-year
growth after a challenging previous year and Austria
posted growth of 12 %. A major project was stopped
in Austria at the beginning of 2014, but this short-
fall was more than compensated by new orders. This
established the basis for the improvement in results
that was achieved. “Expert Resourcing” developed
successfully as well with 72 % sales growth to a total
of EUR 10.2 million. Most of the sales with external
experts are generated in the context of adesso Group
projects. External resources are used here for capac-
ity reasons or to obtain highly specialised knowl-
edge. An additional contribution to sales growth
in the IT Services segment was made by the busi-
ness activities in Turkey as well as Smart Hosting &
Cloud Services.

In the IT Solutions segment, licence and main-
tenance sales in the Content Solutions business
area for the high-end content management sys-
tem FirstSpirit were increased by 20 %. Here, the
investments in our international presence paid off
in the form of significant sales in the USA, Swit-
zerland and Benelux. Sales once again increased
disproportionately in the Mobile Solutions busi-
ness area, by 28 % to EUR 6.7 million. Mobilising
web content and business processes is one of the
fastest-growing areas in IT. In this field, adesso is
a leading company for enterprise mobility in Ger-

many. Our own in|MOTION technology along
with proven expertise in the development of
mobile applications and integration with knowl-
edge about core business processes among adesso
customers make a contribution here. Growing
sales are being generated in this area with mobile
strategy consulting services for companies, espe-
cially related to the digital transformation of many
business models.

The IT Services segment achieved a growth rate of
18 %, and the IT Solutions segment 24 %. Intergroup
sales between the segments increased by 38 %.

Sales were increased with many of the top 10 cus-
tomers and the share of total sales remained nearly
constant at 40 %. With a 16 % increase in total
sales revenues, adesso successfully continued to
strengthen its position as a strategic IT partner—also
among the top 10 customers.

The biggest sales increase was achieved in the core
public administration sector. Significant sales
growth was also generated in healthcare. Sales
increased again in the energy industry for the first
time since completing the restructuring. Business
with banks and insurance companies, which are
core industries for adesso, nearly reached the very
high level of the previous year. “Cross Industries”

outside the core industries generated 31 % higher
sales for a total of EUR 56 million. The increase is
due to, among other things, several major projects
in the e-commerce environment, higher licence
sales with the cross-industry product FirstSpirit
and more intensive business activities in the Auto-
motive & Transportation sector. This is being
transferred to a separate line of business in 2015
according to the adesso growth strategy, which will
further promote the growing business with lead-
ing automobile manufacturers and suppliers. Sales
with customers outside of Germany increased
by 12 % in 2014 to EUR 24.7 million. This was
achieved mainly outside the DACH region in the
USA, the Netherlands and Turkey.

Earnings

Operating earnings (EBITDA) increased by 26 %
in 2014 and the EBITDA margin was improved
from 5.7 % to 6.2 %. The targets were therefore
exceeded. Organic sales growth of 16 % was the
most important driver for this major improvement
in results. A higher gross margin per employee
was also realised through improved daily rates.
The profit margin from external resources and the
maintenance and licence sales that were gener-
ated, which have a major influence on earnings,
increased as well. Capacity utilisation remained
virtually unchanged year on year.

At sales growth of 16 %, the average number of
employees (FTE) grew by only 12 %, or 142 employ-
ees, to 1,298 in 2014. With a much higher material
usage ratio of 12.1 % (previous year: 10.2 %), gross
profit per employee nevertheless increased by 1 % to
EUR 106 thousand (previous year: EUR 105 thou-
sand). At EUR 2.1 million, other operating income
fell by EUR 0.1 million year on year.

The cost of materials at EUR 19.0 million (previ-
ous year: EUR 13.8 million), mainly for the pro-
ject integration of subcontractors, increased sig-
nificantly faster at 38 % compared to sales. This
development is not so much the expression of a
controlled strategy. Rather it is the result of some
special customer situations and the more restric-
tive policy of many enterprises in regard to the
direct employment of freelancers in their own
projects. Gross profit grew more slowly than sales,
by 14 % to EUR 137.9 million (previous year:
EUR 121.5 million), asa result. Personnel costs also
increased by 13 % to EUR 98.9 million. There was
a minor increase in the average personnel costs per
employee to EUR 76 thousand. The year-on-year
change in personnel costs therefore had a neutral
effect on the operating margin.

Other operating expenses increased 12 % to
EUR 31.6 million (previous year: EUR 28.1 mil-

lion), mainly due to the greater number of employ-
ees. Costs such as travel, vehicle and training
expenses tended to increase proportionately with
each employee. There was a major increase in occu-
pancy and related costs in 2014 due to moving into
the new corporate headquarters in Dortmund. This
became necessary in order to bring the staff, which
had been distributed across three buildings because
of growth, back to one central location and to pro-
vide space for further growth. The overall increase
in other operating expenses was, however, less than
the growth in sales, so that these cost types resulted
in a margin increase in 2014.

Total operating earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
increased by 26 %, or EUR 2.0 million, in 2014 to
EUR 9.8 million (previous year: EUR 7.8 million).
The target corridor for 2014 of EUR 8.5 million to
EUR 9.0 million was therefore exceeded. The oper-
ating EBITDA margin is 6.2 % compared to 5.7 % in
the previous year.

Income increased significantly in the second half of
the year. After EBITDA of EUR 3.3 million and an
EBITDA margin of 4.4 % in the first half of 2014,
the results in the second half of the year increased
to EUR 6.5 million and 7.9 %, respectively. The
increase during the year is largely due to the higher

number of potential working days, improved earn-
ings in Austria and higher licence sales.

Both segments contributed to the increase in earn-
ings. Higher earnings in the IT Services segment
were mainly due to the divisions Arithnea (e-com-
merce), adesso Austria and the business with exter-
nal specialised precision services. In the IT Solu-
tions segment, the adesso mobile solutions division
generated 125 % growth in profits and e-Spirit
improved earnings among other things thanks to
progress in developing the international presence.

Depreciation and amortisation fell by EUR 0.5 mil-
lion to EUR 2.4 million in the reporting period. This
figure includes scheduled amortisation of intangible
assets such as customer lists and order backlog from
mergers in the amount of EUR 0.4 million (previous
year: EUR 0.8 million). It also includes depreciation
on property, plant and equipment, which increased

significantly by EUR 0.5 million to EUR 1.8 million
due to moving into the new building in Dortmund.
Goodwill impairment losses of EUR 0.2 million
on the gadiv business unit were also recognised in
2014. Extraordinary depreciation and amortisation
of EUR 0.8 million on the business unit in Austria
was recognised in the previous year.

Income from financing and investing activi-
ties amounted to EUR -83 thousand, after
EUR -217 thousand in the previous year. Interest
expenses fell due to the decrease in the average port-
folio of interest-bearing liabilities from the regular
repayment of loans. Earnings before taxes (EBT)
increased significantly due to higher operating earn-
ings, the decrease in depreciation and amortisation,
and the higher income from financing and invest-
ing activities, by 58 % to EUR 7.3 million (previous
year: EUR 4.6 million). Income tax expenses were

EUR 3.3 million (previous year: EUR 1.6 million).
No deferred tax assets were recognised on current
losses of subsidiaries in the amount of EUR 2.1 mil-
lion, so that the arithmetical tax rate came in at
45 % (previous year: 35 %). Overall, this resulted
in positive consolidated earnings of EUR 4.0 mil-
lion in 2014 compared to EUR 3.0 million in the
previous year. The proportion of consolidated
earnings allocated to minority interests increased
from EUR 0.2 million in the previous year to

The order volume continued to increase in paral-
lel to sales growth. Demand remained consistently
dynamic in the course of the year. A general slump
in demand was not observed in any region, segment

Financial Position

Financial Management Principles and Objectives
adesso pursues a balanced financial policy. The
objective of financial management is to assure
short-term liquidity, including a margin of safety,
as well as to secure and acquire financial assets to
fund medium-and long-term investment pro-
jects. In principle, the company does not enter into
investment transactions with speculative elements.
There are no variable interest rates on investments.
The maximum investment term is six months, with
investments on a daily basis being the most com-
mon in view of interest rates tending towards zero
for low-risk investments in order to remain flexible
in response to investment opportunities that arise.
Central cash management based on daily account
clearing has not been set up. Bank borrowing is
centralised with the parent company. The account
balances and financial position of all companies
are transparent to the Group’s Executive Board,
and constitute a standard element of the monthly
reporting system. All interest — bearing liabilities are
denominated in euros. Factoring or other methods
of selling receivables are not used.

Kapitalstruktur

Financing is needed primarily for the receivables
portfolio and services that have not been settled
in the amount of EUR 34.7 million (previous year:
EUR 29.0 million). Working capital (trade accounts
receivable plus receivables PoC less trade accounts
payable less liabilities PoC) was EUR 23.6 million as
of 31 December 2014 (previous year: EUR 21.7 mil-
lion). The need for advance financing of business
operations therefore increased by 9 % year on year,
whereas sales rose by 16 %. However, there were no
significant changes in customer payment patterns or
in receivables management. Two loans for acquisi-
tions totalling EUR 2.2 million were taken out in
2014 to finance furnishings for the newly occupied
corporate headquarters in Dortmund. The portfo-
lio of interest-bearing financial liabilities increased
as a result, from EUR 5.4 million in the previous
year to EUR 5.7 million on the reporting date. The
remaining terms of the loans on the reporting date
range from six months to seven years. Interest is
fixed over the entire term. A fixed interest rate was
secured for a variable interest-bearing loan by means
of an interest rate swap. This loan was fully repaid
by 31 December 2014. All interest — bearing liabili-
ties are denominated in euros. Credit balances are
largely available in the short term and bear interest
at fixed rates. Net liquidity (liquidity less interest-
bearing liabilities) is EUR 18.0 million (previous
year: EUR 16.3 million).

Investments, Acquisitions and Divestments

The adesso business model requires relatively low
investments in property, plant and equipment. The
property, plant and equipment of EUR 4.9 million
(previous year: EUR 2.0 million) largely consist of
hardware such as laptops and servers as well as office
furnishings. This significant increase is due to the
investments in the new corporate headquarters.
There are no significant subsequent obligations from
property, plant and equipment investment projects
as of 31 December 2014, and no investment back-
log to report. There were no company acquisitions
in the reporting period. adesso founded a company
together with a customer in 2014, with adesso hold-
ing 24 % of the shares and a stake of EUR 120 thou-
sand of paid-up share capital.

Liquidity

Cash and cash equivalents total EUR 23.7 million
on the reporting date (previous year: EUR 21.6 mil-
lion). They are partly offset by interest-bearing
liabilities, mainly from acquisition loans, in
the amount of EUR 5.7 million (previous year:
EUR 5.4 million). Asa result, net liquidity (liquid-
ity less interest-bearing liabilities) increased by
EUR 1.7 million to EUR 18.0 million (previous
year: EUR 16.3 million).

Cash flow from operating activities rose notice-
ably from EUR 7.6 million in the previous year to
EUR 9.2 million. This increase is largely due the
EUR 2.7 million growth in earnings before taxes.
Following the release of EUR 2.0 million in the pre-
vious year resulting from the change to net operating
assets, an additional EUR 0.2 million was tied up in
2014 due to the disproportionate increase in trade
accounts receivable compared to sales. Cash flows
from investment activities were EUR -5.4 mil-
lion (previous year: EUR -1.2 million). This pro-
nounced increase resulted from expenditures for
acquiring new office and technical equipment for
the new corporate headquarters in Dortmund.
Cash flows from financing activities were only
EUR -1.7 million compared to EUR -6.0 million
in the previous year. This was the result of taking
out EUR 2.2 million in new loans and the reduced
repayment of financial liabilities in the amount
of EUR 2.6 million (previous year: EUR 4.3 mil-
lion, of which EUR 1.1 million was a subsequent
purchase price payment to the sellers of Arithnea
GmbH). Dividends of EUR 1.5 million (previous
year: EUR 1.6 million) were paid out, of which
EUR 1.2 million went to adesso AG’s shareholders
(previous year: EUR 1.0 million). Accordingly, cash
and cash equivalents changed by EUR 2.1 million,
compared to EUR 0.4 million in the previous year.

As in the previous year, lines of credit with several
banks of EUR 1.7 million could be utilised. There was
no availment of credit lines on the reporting date.

Variable salary components are paid from cash and
cash equivalents and are paid out in the first few
months of 2015. This is typical for the business.
Overall, the liquidity of the adesso Group is ade-
quate to carry on current business operations, for the
planned redemption of liabilities and to compensate
for ordinary fluctuations in capacity utilisation.

Annual Report 2014

Net Assets

Analysis of the Asset Structure

Total assets on the reporting date increased year on
year by 12 %, or EUR 8.9 million, to EUR 84.0 mil-
lion. On the assets side, trade accounts receivable
increased by EUR S.1 million, which was mainly
due to sales growth, while property, plant, and
equipment increased by EUR 3.0 million because
of the investments in the new corporate headquar-
ters. Overall, current assets therefore grew faster
than non-current assets. On the liabilities side,
the current liabilities, in particular trade accounts
payable, increased by EUR 5.5 million in parallel to
developments on the assets side. Equity increased
as well, amounting to EUR 38.7 million compared
to EUR 36.0 million in the previous year. The
equity ratio fell to 46.1 % compared to 48.0 % in
the previous year.

Financial and Non-financial Performance Indicators
The key financial performance indicators used for
internal control of the Group are sales growth,
EBITDA and the EBITDA margin. Targets and
actual values for the reporting period as well as the
medium-and long-term target corridor are provided
in the table.

adesso does not use any group-wide non-financial
performance indicators for the internal control of
the group. Since adesso AG is of paramount impor-
tance to the group, generating around two-thirds of
the adesso Group’s business, reporting on the finan-
cial and non-financial performance indicators used
for the internal control of adesso AG follows.

The development of earnings generated by adesso
AG depends ona number of performance indicators.
In addition to the growth rate which is achieved,
these are in particular:

Employee Capacity Utilisation (Proportion of
Employees Working on Customer Projects)

The proportion of employees working on billable
customer projects has a direct influence on earn-
ings. The greatest possible constant and high uti-
lisation is the goal, without severely limiting flex-
ibility in staffing new projects. Since the end and
beginning of projects cannot always be optimally
scheduled in sequence, some basic non-utilisation
of capacity is unavoidable. Utilisation is measured
biweekly according to the number of employees

in operations and is reported as the proportion of
employees that are not assigned to a project.

Capacity utilisation was improved in 2014 com-
pared to the previous year. The value is within the
target corridor.

Booking Intensity (Average of Billed Hours per
Project Day)

The number of billable customer hours as the basis
for sales and earnings is subject to fluctuations,
which do not depend on the order situation, such
as the number of potential working days, holidays
taken, illness and capacity utilisation. When these
effects are neutralised in the analysis of billable
customer hours, it is possible to determine the
average billable customer hours per project day
for an employee assigned to a project, provided
that structures remain unchanged. The book-
ing intensity determined this way measures the
development of quantitative value creation per
employee in the project. Since additional or fewer
hours worked per project day leave costs virtually
unchanged, a change in the booking intensity has a
direct impact on earnings. The booking intensity is
also influenced by the intensity of pursuing inter-
nal projects for company development, business
development or pre-sales. It is specified as a per-
centage of an eight-hour workday.

The booking intensity fell in 2014 compared to the
previous year. It is only just within the target corridor.

Average Daily Rates

The change in the average daily rates, both in pro-
jects billed on a time and materials basis and in
fixed-price projects on a calculation basis, is a
key earnings driver. In particular compared to the
change in labour cost per employee as the leading
cost item, it has a significant impact on the operat-
ing earnings margin. Accordingly, the daily rates are
a fixed internal control element. Their development
is tracked on an individual customer basis and they
are purposefully examined for improvement poten-
tial. The change in the average daily rate is reported
as a percentage compared to the previous period. In
2014 the increase in the daily rate for projects billed
ona time and materials basis was satisfactory.

adesso Group

Annual Report 2014

The number of project days in fixed-price projects
that exceed the budget has a direct impact on earn-
ings, since those days are not available for other
potential working time. Even if they can only be
used in combination with projects completed
below budget for an overall image of the impact that
fixed-price projects have on earnings, the change in
budget overruns serves as a signal for progress or
setbacks related to fixed-price projects. The evalu-
ation is based on days and not on euros, so this is a
qualitative view.

Together with the arithmetical daily rates used in
project calculations, the under- and over-budget
ratio is used to derive the calculated daily rate on
fixed-projects during post-calculation. In 2014,
the calculated daily rate for fixed-price projects was
increased even though budget overruns went up.

adesso AG also examines employee aspects as non-
financial performance indicators. As a fast-growing
premium IT service provider, adesso depends on
the ability to attract many of the best graduates and
experienced experts as new employees, to pursue
their internal further development as extensively
as possible and to retain them over the long term.
Here the following two performance indicators are
of particular relevance.

Recruiting Performance Figures and Turnover

Recruiting examines the number of applications
received, initial interviews conducted and new
hires. The turnover ratio is based on employee res-
ignations of permanent staff. In 2014, the number
of applications received and the initial interviews
were increased significantly above the sales growth
rate. The number of new hires on the other hand fell
so that this target was not met. While the turnover
ratio increased, itremained within the target corridor.

Group management also examines the development
of licence and maintenance sales from the FirstSpirit
product as an internal performance indicator, since
licence sales in a short-term quarterly and financial
year view have a major direct impact on earnings, and
because maintenance sales form the basis for growing
the developmentand marketing cost base of the prod-
uct. Licence and maintenance sales were increased in
2014 and the targets were exceeded.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

No further events of material importance to adesso
AG occurred after the reporting date on 31 Decem-
ber 2014.

FORECAST, OPPORTUNI-
TIES AND RISK REPORTS

Forecast Report

Group Orientation over the Next Two Financial
Years

adesso’s vision of becoming one of Central Europe’s
leading IT consulting firms for industry-specific
business processes will be pursued with vigour. The
strategic guidelines for growth through industry seg-
mentation, portfolio expansion in IT Services, inter-
nationalisation and the expansion of the company’s
solution portfolio in the IT Solutions business area
will continue to determine what action adesso takes
over the next two years. The same acquisition policy
will be pursued. Irrespective of the acquisition pol-
icy, organic growth will continue to be spurred on in
all industries and regions. Sales generated abroad are
to be increased, in particular, through further inter-
nationalisation of sales of the FirstSpirit product
and the adesso subsidiary being established in Tur-
key. The planned bundling of solutions for insur-
ance products, as part of the development of adesso
insurance solutions, should help adesso to position
itself increasingly as a product partner, in addition
to its strong positioning as a sought-after IT service
partner. As the company aims to maintain its high
pace of growth and innovation, there will be a nega-
tive impact on the operating EBITDA margin in the
next two years. However, a reduction of that margin
should be avoided.

Future Macroeconomic Situation

After three years of decreased economic growth
in Germany, in 2014 there was a significant 1.6 %
year-on-year increase in gross domestic product.
Since the summer of 2014, which was negatively
affected by crises, the German federal government
believes there are indications that the current recov-
ery may solidify. The recovery is expected to con-
tinue in 2015, even though growth is not expected

to accelerate over the year as a whole. In its annual

Annual Report 2014

economic forecast, the German federal government
predicted an average year-on-year GDP increase of
1.5 %. Positive impetus in the domestic economy
will result from increases in income and ongoing
job creation, as well as the minimum wage and the
extension of pension benefits. The international
economic environment continues to be seen as dif-
ficult as a result of geopolitical tensions and contin-
uing weak growth in the eurozone. Low oil prices
will drive growth. The low value of the euro means
moderate increases in exports are expected.

Based on information provided by an expert group
commissioned by the Swiss government, the Swiss
State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, SECO, is
expecting moderately increased growth of 2.1%
in 2015 and of 2.4 % in 2016, following growth of
1.8 % in 2014. The forecast is based on the assump-
tion that the recovery in the eurozone will continue
and signals increasing uncertainty regarding eco-
nomic development based on the most recent indi-
cators of sentiment.

On the basis of forecasts published by the Austrian
Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) and the
Institute for Advanced Studies (IHS), the Austrian
Federal Ministry of Economics, Family and Youth
is anticipating growth in Austrian GDP of between
0.5 % and 0.8 % in 2015 and between 1.1 % and
1.6 % in 2016.

Asaresult, 2015 will continue to offer a favourable
macroeconomic climate for adesso, although, taking
into account actual development in previous years,
it also continues to pose risks. The key assump-
tion underlying the German federal government’s
projections is that the financial sector will remain
stable and that there will be no negative develop-
ments in the eurozone or global economy, which
would create renewed uncertainty among market
participants. However, due to measures taken and
the trend towards stabilisation of the financial sec-
tor and the eurozone thus far, it is not yet expected
that the positive trend in terms of further economic
growth in adesso-relevant sectors will take a turn for
the worse in 2015 and 2016.

Future Industry Situation

According to industry association BITKOM, the IT
market in Germany will continue to develop far more
positively than the economy asa whole in 2015, with

market volume increasing to EUR 79.7 billion. The
expected growth rate of 2.4 % in 2015 is almost 1
percentage point higher than that of gross domestic
product overall, although the sector will be signifi-
cantly less dynamic than in 2014. Within the infor-
mation technology sector, BITKOM expects the
software segment to achieve the highest growth, at
an almost unchanged rate of 5.5 %. The IT services
segment, which is particularly relevant to adesso,
is expected to grow by a further 3.0 %. According to
BITKOM’s forecasts, the growth of the IT market in
2015 will be exclusively driven by the IT services and
software segments, which are relevant to adesso and
which will compensate for the slight decrease in the
third market segment, hardware. adesso’s internal
forecasts predict growth of 3 % in the markets rel-
evant to the company in the DACH region.

Anticipated Sales and Earnings Situation

The report on risks and opportunities is a pivotal part
of management’s considerations of the further devel-
opment of adesso and of the forecast report. Potential
acquisitions are not included in the forecast calcula-
tions. Based on anticipated economic growth of 3 %
in relevant segments of the IT market as well as on
internal calculations, adesso’s managements expect-
ing the following in 2015:

> An increase in sales revenues of between 6 %and 9 %
to between EUR 166 million and EUR 171 million
is expected (2014: sales revenues of EUR 157 mil-
lion were achieved, target: EUR 144 million to
EUR 148 million).

> An operating result, EBITDA, in the range between
EUR 9.8 million and EUR 10.5 million is expected
(2014: an operating result of EUR 9.8 million was
achieved, target: EUR 8.5 million to EUR 9.0 mil-
lion), a planned increase of 7 %.

> The operating EBITDA margin is again expected to
beat least 6.0 % (2014: an operating EBITDA mar-
gin of 6.2 % was achieved, target: at least 6.0 %).

This growth, which is significantly above the
industry average, is expected to predominantly
originate from the IT Services business area. The
12 % expansion of the headcount in the adesso
subsidiary in Germany in 2014 has also led to ris-
ing expectations for 2015 in terms of sales. Turkey
is also expected to register growth. In view of the

Q croup MANAGEMENT REPORT

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT — SERVICE

Risk Reports

sustained high demand for consultancy services
and development in the enterprise mobility seg-
ment, adesso mobile solutions is also expected to
continue its above-average growth

The planned increase in the operating result is pri-
marily based on growth targets and the expected
improvement in results in Austria and Turkey. A
large increase in operating results will be offset
by investment in the regional expansion of Group
companies Arithnea (e-commerce) and adesso
mobile solutions, and an increase in the cost base
in the USA relating to the envisaged even broader
positioning of FirstSpirit, as well as the dispropor-
tionate increase in fixed costs at adesso AG resulting
from the forward-looking construction of its new
corporate headquarters in Dortmund.

A higher contribution to earnings is expected in the
second half of the year because it has 131 potential
working days, which is nine days, or 7 %, more than
the first half of the year. Based on previous years,
this makes an enormous difference. Moreover, expe-
rience has shown that licence sales are higher in the
second half of the year.

For 2016, we are anticipating further sales growth as
well as further positive development of the operat-
ing result.

Expected Financial Position

adesso’s liquid asset base is solid and will be sufficient
to cover financial obligations in 2015 should the fore-
cast business development come to fruition. adesso’s
balance sheet structure allows it to assume additional
liabilities for investment projects to ensure that there
are no shortfalls in terms of financing. adesso contin-
ues to strive fora positive net cash position. Only in
the event of the potential acquisition ofan unusually
large or profitable company of extremely high stra-
tegic value for adesso, would there be any deviation
from this strategy.

Based on this, the Executive Board is continuing to
pursue its dividend policy, which envisages a well-
balanced combination of investments in growth,
financial stability and the participation of sharehold-
ers in the company’s profit. If the profit targets can be
achieved to a large extent, the Executive Board will
strive to further increase the dividend. The dividend
proposed for 2015 will reflect actual developments.

Opportunities and Risk Report

Risk management is a pivotal component ofall deci-
sions and business processes. adesso takes a broad
view of risk, defined as the risk of not achieving
financial and operating targets as planned and, in the
strictest sense, factors endangering the existence of
the company. In order to safeguard the success of the
company over the long term, it is therefore essential
that adesso identifies and analyses risks efficiently
and combats or mitigates them by implementing suf-
ficient control measures. adesso’s active risk manage-
ment therefore also opens up opportunities for the
company.

Risk Management System

adesso possesses a system of processes and data
analysis structures to monitor risks posed to the
company. An exclusive risk management software
system is not used. Instead, adesso uses an inte-
grated system developed by Corporate Planning
AG for financial and operational planning as well
as operational controlling. All plan and actual data
from all business areas is stored in a central data-
base for the purposes of reporting. Current figures
are recorded directly from the company’s finan-
cial accounting. Key performance indicators such
as sales per employee, available liquidity, resources
not fully utilised and incoming orders and the order
backlog are registered. All companies included in
the scope of consolidation are part of the reporting
system.

Fixed reporting channels have been established for
other risks, such as those arising from the absence
of contracts, high levels of receivables from cus-
tomers or projects that are threatening to go over
budget. Certain reporting thresholds apply, which,
if breached, result in the issue being included on the
agenda of Executive Board meetings. Similar risks
posed to companies in adesso Group are identi-
fied through close cooperation with the respective
responsible Executive Board member of adesso AG.
adesso does not have a central risk manager. Risk
reporting and assessment is documented in a risk
manual. The risk manual is submitted to the Super-
visory Board so that the risk management system
can be acknowledged and reviewed.

Recognising opportunities and new areas of busi-
ness are just as important for the development of

53


--- Page 17 ---

54

adesso Group

Annual Report 2014

adesso. Working groups consisting of the Executive
Board, Business Development, the management of
companies in adesso Group and heads of business
areas, meet on a regular basis to analyse new busi-
ness opportunities and develop new business mod-
els, industries, solutions or regions. The progress
made in implementing these measures is presented
at regular intervals.

Within the scope of a risk inventory, the following
risks were assessed as relevant to the business and
subsequently assessed in view of their probability
of occurrence and amount of loss. In principal, only
risks that would have negative implications for the
asset, financial or profit situation are listed here.

Moreover, adesso is potentially exposed to further
risks which may not be known or be considered as
major risks at the current time. The risk factor is cal-
culated from the probability of occurrence and the
amount of loss, which determines how relevant the
tisk is. The following risks were identified as of the
reporting date and as of the preparation of the man-
agement report as having a risk factor worthy of
inclusion in this report:

Primary Risk Carrier

Project Risks

In the event of the budgeted time frame and costs
being exceeded, fixed-price projects can lead to
project-related losses. Budget deviations are iden-
tified and analysed constantly during every fixed-
price project. There is also an escalation mecha-
nism that extends to the Executive Board. As of
the reporting date, there were no cases where a
customer refused to accept delivery (previous
year: one case). No customers claimed back pay-
ments totalling more than a hundred thousand
euros (previous year: one customer/several hun-
dred thousand euros). Several projects presented
for customer approval have not yet been formally
accepted by the customer. However, no customer
has refused approval, and those delays are not
unusual in normal business practice. The backlog
of fixed-price projects that have yet to be invoiced
in full rose year on year. However, project risk is
lower than previously estimated because the legal
claims in the previous year regarding payments
totalling several hundred thousand euros have
been successfully defeated and the fixed-price pro-
ject that began in Austria in the previous year and

that was subject to significant losses has been com-
pleted. In the previous year, a customer in Austria
also threatened damage claims of EUR 1.3 million
for allegedly high subsequent costs relating to the
software supplied as part of a project. Those claims
have not been pursued in court and adesso can-
not see any grounds for the claims. There was no
further communication with the former customer
regarding the claim in 2014.

adesso uses an Excel-based project controlling
and reporting system. Depending on the project
structure, sub-projects are defined and mapped on
adesso’s web-based project and schedule manage-
ment system. Expenses are distributed across the
sub-projects and milestones are defined. Over the
course of the project, actual time and expenses are
compared with planning figures, the expenses are
calculated and compliance with the defined sched-
ule is documented. Additional monthly or weekly
assessments of work still to be completed are used
to calculate the level of completion of the project
under-way. By comparing the level of completion
and the remaining expenses, any potential budget
deviations can be identified at an early stage. Pro-
jects that are likely to exceed the budget are given
“overspend” status and are then added to the
agenda of subsequent Executive Board meetings.
Aside from acknowledging the risk, the Executive
Board meeting also discusses potential strategies to
improve the situation by analysing the reasons for
the overspending. However, the share of projects
with fixed budgets in the form of service contracts
in terms of overall adesso sales is low at under
20 %. In spite of this, the negative effects of budget
overspends in fixed-price projects over the past
few years have risen. In order to counteract this
trend, adesso AG has established a Project Manage-
ment Office (PMO) where experts supervise par-
ticularly large-scale or challenging projects using
standardised tools and mechanisms alongside the
regular project management team. These tools and
processes were further developed in 2014 and are
now used routinely. Expenses arising from budget
overspends for new fixed-price projects tended to
be lower compared to the previous year.

Risks from a Shortfall in Planned Sales

In the event of a high gross margin and a large pro-
portion of fixed costs, low sales can be directly
reflected in adesso’s results. Sales improved

year on year in 2014, thereby clearly exceeding
planned sales, as was also the case in the previous
year. General expectations in terms of economic
development in 2015 are cautiously optimistic
and foresee stable growth. Demand appears to be
at a solid level, as in previous planning periods,
despite the fact that the crisis in Ukraine and the
Greek sovereign debt crisis could lead to abrupt
changes in the overall economic climate. Those
factors are considered less of a risk than in the pre-
vious year, partly because of the rate of adesso’s
organic growth. In IT Services, capacity utilisa-
tion is expected to be average in 2015. However,
a decline in order intake or the termination of
important ongoing customer orders could result
in idle periods with corresponding implications
for the profit and financial situation within a short
period of time. Given that the IT Services business
area in particular generates business over specific
periods of time, such idle periods are difficult to
compensate for. As this risk factor is highly rele-
vant to the company, adesso monitors the follow-
ing values on a monthly and sometimes biweekly
basis in order to identify trends at an early stage
and take corresponding action: Order backlog,
order intake, number of hours invoiced and capac-
ity utilisation rates, number of employees not
working at full capacity.

The IT Solutions segment pursues a product strat-
egy. In this segment, even standard solutions
developed by adesso are sold and implemented
through licensing with maintenance contracts.
While the established base of maintenance con-
tracts represents a relatively stable basis for sales,
the achievement of targets and the results of
product companies are reliant on order intake
and much more volatile than the service busi-
ness, given the low number of new licences sold.
Sales revenues from maintenance activities do
not cover total ongoing costs at any of the adesso
Group companies. Asa result, the product com-
panies’ licence sales and related sales pipelines
are monitored in detail in terms of structure and
development over time. Plan deviation risk will
increase slightly in IT Solutions in 2015 because
expected licence sales from the FirstSpirit product
in the USA is significantly higher than in the pre-
vious year. As the cost base in the USA increased
in 2014, and further increases in marketing costs
have been budgeted for 2015, below-plan perfor-

mance in this area could have a significant impact
on the performance situation of adesso Group.

In each business area, there are detailed plans in
which actual figures and previous year’s figures
are compared on a monthly basis. A revised fore-
cast continues to be produced to detail emerging
plan deviations at an early stage. The correspond-
ing reports form the foundations for monthly
meetings on business development and business
prospects. This applies to all companies of adesso
Group.

Financial Risks

The risks posed by the financial situation and
liquidity have decreased. Cash and cash equiva-
lents and the net cash position increased year on
year, even though a new loan of EUR 2.2 million
was taken out in 2014 to finance investment in the
new corporate headquarters in Dortmund. That
loan, and acquisition loans taken out in previous
years, must be repaid regardless of the economic
performance of the company. However, liquid
assets far exceed loan liabilities meaning that the
complete repayment of loans using cash reserves
remains a possibility.

Currency risks remain low for adesso, but are
again increasing compared to the previous year
due to growing sales revenue outside the euro-
zone and the pronounced weakness of the euro.
Only a small proportion of sales are conducted in
a currency other than the euro. These transactions
mainly concern adesso Schweiz AG and e-Spirit
Schweiz AG, which conduct business in Swiss
francs, adesso Turkey, which operates in Turkish
lira, e-Spirit UK Ltd., which conducts business in
British pounds and e-Sprit Inc., which operates in
US dollars. These companies process the majority
of their business in the respective national cur-
rency. No currency hedging transactions were car-
ried out.

adesso AG’s loss carry-forwards for trade tax and
corporation tax purposes as of 31 December 2006
continued to be utilised in relation to BOV AG in
consideration of minimum taxation following the
fusion of adesso AG (old). However, the possibility
cannot be ruled out that financial administration at
adesso AG will not recognise the restructuring of
business operations of BOV AG in accordance with

55

adesso Group

Annual Report 2014

Section 8 (4) Kérperschaftssteuergesetz (KStG
— German Corporation Tax Act) at all or to the
full extent. Failure to do so would mean that the
commercial and corporate tax loss carry-forwards
of adesso AG would be eliminated in whole or in
part. Tax expenses in adesso AG’s 2014 annual
report would increase by EUR 1,872 thousand
without the utilisation of loss carry-forwards and,
since the loss carry-forwards have been utilised,
by a total of EUR 8,624 thousand. In the event
that fiscal authorities do not recognise this tax
benefit, this amount would have to be reported
in the income statement and paid out less interest
on arrears of EUR 1,043 thousand (calculated as
of 31 December 2014). In addition, the deferred
tax assets on loss carry-forwards previously offset
against deferred tax liabilities of EUR 2,827 thou-
sand would have to be recognised as a liability,
which would have substantial negative implica-
tions for adesso AG’s net assets, financial position
and results of operations. Fiscal authorities have
ordered a company audit for the period from 2009
to 2013 and began preparing the audit in February
2015. The results cannot be predicted at this time.

Loss carry-forwards existing for trade tax and cor-
poration tax purposes as of the acquisition of evu.
it GmbH (April 2010, under the name precision
services GmbH as of the reporting date) have been
utilised. However, the possibility cannot be ruled
out that evu.it’s financial administration will not
recognise the restructuring of business operations
in accordance with Section 8c (1) Sentences 6 to 9
German Corporation Tax Act (KStG) at all or to the
full extent. Non-recognition would mean that the
companies’ loss carry-forwards existing for trade
tax and corporation tax purposes as of the acquisi-
tion would expire either in part or in full. Without
the utilisation of loss carry-forwards tax expenses
in precision services GmbH’s 2014 annual report
would increase by EUR 216 thousand and by a
total of EUR 275 thousand since the utilisation of
the loss carry-forwards.

Financial risk can arise from the payment terms of
service agreements for completed projects with
significant volumes. In addition to prepayments
and instalments, payments are often linked to the
completion of the project. In the case of delayed
completion, significant liquidity shortfalls can
arise. The resulting risks can be predicted in the

scope of project controlling, but not prevented.
In some cases project completion bonds must be
deposited and are paid out if a project fails. In the
case of major projects, service agreements can lead
to large receivables. For example, if a customer
has not paid two monthly invoices and the third
month of service is already being provided. The
level of unpaid receivables and their development
are included in monthly reporting at the indi-
vidual company level. The CFO includes major
receivables on the part of adesso AG in the agenda
of Executive Board meetings, where individual
strategies for collection are determined. There are
currently several major projects (previous year:
one) that could have a significant negative effect
on adesso’s liquidity. Projects relating to adesso
solutions for the insurance industry, in particular,
involve flows of liquidity that are largely inde-
pendent of the provision of services. For this rea-
son, the possible losses for this risk factor have
been increased. There were no notable risks from
financial instruments.

Personnel Risks

adesso is an IT company without any notable fixed
assets. The company’s most important assets are
its employees. Asa result, adesso constantly moni-
tors and assesses a number of key performance
indicators such as headcount, number of unpro-
ductive employees, number of employees on sick
leave, employee, costs/sales per employee and
capacity utilisation. The top-level management is
always informed about every dismissal and new
recruit. The Executive Board regularly analyses
trends and discussed measures in its meetings.
This allows any potential loss of knowledge and
expertise to be identified promptly. In the prod-
uct segments, essential knowledge is concen-
trated around a small group of key developers.
These developers are a particular focus of human
resources activities.

The search for suitable, experienced employ-
ees remains characterised by a demand surplus
from companies. However, the situation has not
deteriorated compared to the previous year. By
contrast, the resulting entry-level salary expecta-
tions expressed by new recruits, as well as existing
employees’ expectations regarding pay rises, can-
not always be compensated through a correspond-
ing adjustment of market prices, meaning that the

operating margin can be negatively impacted as a
result. adesso reinforces its position as a premium
IT service provider through extraordinarily tal-
ented employees with a vast amount of experience
in their fields. Competitors in this area continue to
increase their headcounts — not simply IT service
providers, but also between user companies and
the IT industry. A small number of employees are
responsible for adesso’s outstanding position in
its core industries. The simultaneous departure of
more than one of these employees would expose
the company to medium-term risks in terms of
its further development. Such risks are combated
through active recruiting, strategies to intensify
employee loyalty and excellent career prospects in
a prospering company.

Employee turnover remained at a stable level in
line with the average for the industry in 2014,
with a slight increase at adesso AG. The risk of
insufficient availability of experienced employees
was again assessed as having increased. The cost of
recruitment has risen further. The risk from high
employee turnover and salaries increasing dispro-
portionately to market prices was assessed as con-
stant. As a result, personnel risk remains one of the
Group’s highly weighted main risks.

Other Relevant Risks

Risks from Business Activities in other Legal
Systems

adesso Group continues to expand internationally
and enter new legal systems. This involves risks
relating to lacking knowledge of legal affairs and
business practices. In 2012, e-Spirit AG estab-
lished a company based in the USA, e-Spirit Inc.
with offices in Boston, and expanded the number
of employees and its sales activities in 2013 and
2014. In the USA, the risk of product manufac-
turers taking legal action is greater than it is in
Germany. The German management team has
little experience in dealing with American cus-
tomers. e-Spirit Inc. has an insurance policy with
the maximum amount of liability that it could be
granted. In terms of both the legal structure of the
company as well as internal cost allocation, it has
been ensured that the potential for any problems
to spread across to e-Spirit AG is as low as pos-
sible. The company established adesso Turkey in
Istanbul, which has begun operations. The num-
ber of employees in Turkey increased significantly

in 2014. Despite the expected growth of business
in the USA and Turkey, this risk remains at an
unchanged high level compared to the previous
year and continues to be assessed as an other rel-
evant risk, as the company has gathered one year’s
experience with regard to the new legal systems.

Risks from the Customer Structure

As sales from individual customers or customer
groups increase, so does the risk posed by such cus-
tomer relationships from potential project termi-
nations or normal project expiry. In 2014, the larg-
est customer accounted for 8 % (previous year: 8 %)
of total sales. A total of 38 % of overall sales were
generated by adesso’s ten largest customers (previ-
ous year: 10 %). Risks from the customer structure
have been decreasing due to adesso’s growth and the
share of sales generated by the top ten customers has
decreased. The expected reduction in sales to the
top ten customers of approximately EUR 5 million
occurred and was well compensated by other busi-
ness. The risk is estimated to be lower than the pre-
vious year and remains an other relevant risk at this
level. However, the abrupt loss of one of the top three
customers or several of the Group’s ten largest cus-
tomers would have the potential to negatively impact
the earnings and financial situation of the company
substantially, at least in the short term. The relation-
ship to each of these top customers is managed by a
member of the Executive Board or by the manage-
ment of the respective subsidiary in order to recognise
potential risks promptly and take appropriate action.

Each quarter, the top ten customers are listed by sales
and each customer’s share of overall sales is calcu-
lated. This avoids concentration on a small number
of customer relationships and therefore allows a clus-
ter risk to be recognised promptly.

Declining or Insufficiently Increasing Daily Rates

A significant proportion of sales is generated by ser-
vice agreements and the charging of hours or days of
service provided to the customer. With rising sala-
ries and prices as the basis for other costs, increases in
nominal hourly and daily rates are essential in order
to maintain the earnings margin and, ultimately, the
existence of the company. However, one must differ-
entiate between a change in the daily rate fora certain
activity for a certain customer and a change in average
daily rates resulting from a different combination of
orders or changes in the customer structure.

587

adesso Group

Annual Report 2014

Atadesso AG, volumes and daily rates are recorded
for all service agreements and analysed in terms of
their development. The volume-weighted aver-
age daily rate of the contract is thus calculated ona
monthly, quarterly and annual basis and reflected
in the historical development. This does not
include orders based on framework agreements or
public tenders, which implies that the figures are
suitable for general statements only. The daily rate
for the orders thus recorded increased by 4 % in
2014 compared to 2013, leading to a subsequent
rise in the risk of realised average daily rates in the
context of overall increases in costs.

The realised daily rates are also periodically
recorded at adesso AG at customer level and ana-
lysed by the Executive Board in terms of necessary
adjustments. Any identified need for action will be
implemented by sales employees wherever possi-
ble, which has anchored the relevant elements in
its target-based system. Realised increases of daily
rates are recorded for each customer and a price
history is maintained. Among existing customers,
the company was able to increase the daily rates
moderately by 2 % to 3 % in 2014, with new cus-
tomers tending to pay significantly more than the
average daily rate. However, it was not possible to
increase the prices paid by several major custom-
ers, and it was necessary to accept a price reduc-
tion in the case of one major customer. The risk
of insufficiently rising daily rates compared to sal-
ary increases and prices on the cost side therefore
remains, but has not increased compared to the
previous year.

Risks from the Development of New Products and
Solutions

Since 2012, adesso Group has significantly
increased its investment in the development of
new products and solutions and therefore shifted
the risk profile of its heavily service-oriented
business model towards its product business. The
volume of investment was substantial in relation
to the consolidated income statement and, as a
result, was included as one of the main risks in
2012. Development of dynamic.suite, the com-
pany’s single most important development, was
stopped in mid-2012; investments made thus far
have been lost. While this underscores the rel-
evance of this risk, it has declined due to a reduc-
tion in investment in 2013 and has been reas-

signed to the other relevant risk category. With
adesso insurance solutions, adesso is pursuing
its strategy of becoming one of the most impor-
tant providers of software solutions to the insur-
ance industry, in addition to its service business.
With this aim in mind, the company is carrying
out major development projects for customers in
the health and property insurance segments. The
available life insurance system is being marketed
broadly. All these products involve increasing risk
from service and maintenance obligations. In the
development phase, there is also increased risk
from higher-than-planned development costs, for
which adesso is partially responsible. That has sig-
nificantly increased the associated risk, compared
to the previous year. However, those risks are off-
set by considerable growth in income from licences
and maintenance.

Risks from Regulatory Law

As a listed company on the regulated market,
adesso AG is subject to a number of additional
legal requirements and obligations, such as the
Aktiengesetz (AktG — German Stock Corpora-
tion Act), the Wertpapierhandelsgesetz (WpHG
— German Securities Trading Act) and the Wertpa-
piertibernahmegesetz (WpUG — German Securi-
ties Acquisition and Takeover Act). adesso follows
corresponding developments in case law, obtains
assessments from experience solicitors and famil-
iarises its entire workforce with the fulfilment of
the legal obligations of a listed company. adesso
follows corresponding developments in case law,
obtains assessments from experience solicitors
and familiarises its entire workforce with the ful-
filment of the legal obligations of a listed company.

The risk of up to EUR 3 million from a review
by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority
(BaFin — Bundesanstalt fiir Finanzdienstleistung-
saufsicht) regarding suspicion of the late publica-
tion of insider Information reported in the previ-
ous year no longer exists. In two of the three cases
under review, BaFin imposed a lower monetary
fine, and in the third case no fine was imposed.
Provisions for the sums paid were included in the
financial statements for the previous year.

Although the latent risk remains unchanged,
the settlement of the dispute with BaFin led toa
reduction in the risk factor compared to the pre-

vious year. The organisation has been further sen-
sitised with regard to ad hoc transparency obliga-
tions.

Overall Statement Concerning the Group’s Risk
Situation

The overall risk profile of adesso decreased slightly
by 1 % to 505 points year-on-year. The modified
assessment of income planning and general liquid-
ity risks had a positive effect, as did lower customer
cluster risk and reduced project risk. The increase
in the assessed probability of occurrence of risks
from the new development of products and solu-
tions by adesso insurance solutions, in particular,
had a negative effect. Liquidity risks from major pro-
jects, loss carry-forwards and employee risks were
assessed as a more significant risk factor. None of
the identified risks can be considered at the current
point in time as risks that endanger the existence of
the company as a going concern. However, the risks
detailed above could have a negative impact on the
asset, financial and earnings situation as well as on
business performance.

Opportunities

adesso has introduced a series of measures to iden-
tify, assess and monitor opportunities for positive
group development. Alongside sales information sys-
tems, these measures are focused on organisational
units for portfolio development within the indus-
try, on the assessment of new technological devel-
opments and on the evaluation of the suitability of
other industries. With the group further increasing
in size, the systematic networking ofall units within
adesso Group is leading to ever-increasing synergy
effects, particularly in sales, and an integrated service
approach for major customers.

In 2015, there will be a wide range of further
opportunities to expand business activities and
increase profits. The PSLife system for life insur-
ance is in a phase of intensive marketing and has
already led to the acquisition of a new major cus-
tomer. The acquisition of a major contract for the
development of further products for the health
and property insurance segments by adesso insur-
ance solutions means that adesso is on the way to
becoming an important provider of insurance solu-
tions in Germany. Once complete, these systems
will offer significant potential from projects for
their implementation at additional customers. In

2015, adesso also established the Automotive and
Transportation line of business. Existing business
with well-known customers in this area is being
consolidated and developed into an independent
adesso portfolio in a targeted manner. Automotive
manufacturers are investing significantly higher
amounts in digitisation, in vehicles, in customer
communications and for internal processes. The
rapid development of the Automotive and Trans-
portation area of business offers additional oppor-
tunities for growth.

The intensification of product internationalisation
strategies in the UK and the USA since 2013 will lead
to additional business prospects in subsequent years
in terms of sales and profits. adesso also projects an
increase in sales in Turkey.

INTERNAL CONTROL
SYSTEM AND RISK MAN-
AGEMENT SYSTEM FOR
THE CONSOLIDATED
ACCOUNTING PROCESS

In the accounting process, there is a risk that the
financial reports based on the accounts could con-
tain misrepresentations of facts that could have
a significant influence on decisions made by the
intended recipients of the reports. These can
include the misallocation of resources and non-per-
formance of certain measures by the management
in terms of the internal operational management
of the company and its subsidiaries, as well as mis-
interpretation on the part of report recipients, and
particularly existing and potential shareholders.
The processes and systems established at adesso
are geared toward identifying potential sources of
errors in the accounting process and thus limiting
the resulting risks. They are intended to ensure
that the annual report and consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with legal
requirements. The report is standardised and iden-
tical in form for both the management report of the
annual financial statement as well as for the group
management report of adesso AG.

adesso Group

Annual Report 2014

At adesso, no control and risk management system
was defined and documented especially for the pur-
poses of the accounting process. There is no internal
auditing structure or risk committee. No external
advisors or auditors were engaged to review the effi-
ciency of the controls in place as part of the consoli-
dated accounting process. The structure of the inter-
nal control mechanisms and risk management system.
is the result of how the accounting and reporting pro-
cesses are organised. The majority of the accounting
is carried out decentrally by each of the companies
within adesso Group. As the parent company, adesso
AG performs accounting services for some adesso
Group companies together with centralised admin-
istrative processes such as payroll accounting. These
companies’ accounts are primarily kept on the same
accounting system as clients. The fact that the same
people are responsible for this process throughout the
group and that the adesso AG CFO has ongoing, direct
access to the reporting and accounting processes pro-
vides an outstanding basis for the standardised, cor-
rect representation of facts. Almost all companies use
astandardised consolidated accounting system, mini-
mising the number of discrepancies from the standard
style of accounting. The detailed coverage of group
accounts means that it is simple to coordinate internal
group performance processes. The respective man-
agement teams are responsible for individual financial
statements. Each financial statement that forms part
of the consolidated financial statement is reviewed
by the group auditor in terms of its plausibility and
compliance with group standards, irrespective ofany
audits per-formed by the local auditor or tax consult-
ant. For this purpose, the auditor of the consolidated
financial statements visits the respective local auditor
and inspects the documentation of key group com-
panies.

All individual financial statements are submitted to
a centralised consolidation system in adesso AG’s
Finance department and consolidated into the con-
solidated financial statement in accordance with the
IFRS reconciliation statement. The software solu-
tion specially procured for this purpose was audited
and certified in accordance with the “Erteilung und
Verwendung von Softwarebescheinigungen” audit-
ing standards (“Issuance and Use of Software Certifi-
cates”) published by the Institut der Wirtschaftpriifer
in Deutschland e.V. (IDW PS 880). All IFRS recon-
ciliation and consolidation processes are fully docu-
mented and traceable.

The core elements of the control and risk manage-
ment system when it comes to accounting is the
monthly, standardised reporting of full monthly
financial statements on the basis of the consolidated
accounts system, the comparison of actual data with
plan data and the update to the full-year forecast. A
member of the adesso AG Executive Board is directly
responsible for every company in adesso Group.
These Executive Board members discuss monthly
financial statements with the respective company
management and are thus able to identify abnormal
developments and discrepancies. The monthly finan-
cial statements of all companies are analysed monthly
by the adesso AG Executive Board. For the quarterly
financial statements, each company must prepare an.
extensive IFRS package containing information for
consolidation and details of the notes. This allows
the Finance department of adesso AG to carry outa
further audit of all information intended for exter-
nal reporting during the financial year. The auditor
of the consolidated financial statement is referred to
for selected issues.

REMUNERATION
REPORT

Principles of the Remuneration System

Atadesso, variable remuneration systems are in place
throughout the group fora variety of functions. Man-
agement remuneration is primarily geared toward the
success of the company and industry standards. The
adesso AG Executive Board receives performance-
related remuneration depending on the medium and
long-term achievement of sales and operating result
targets at both an adesso AG level and a group level.
Part of the Executive Board’s variable remuneration is
share-based in the form of stock options and virtual
stock options, and phantom shares granted to some
members. The Executive Board participated in the
company-wide stock option scheme open to many
employees and which expired at the end of 2013. This
was replaced by a model of virtual stock options for
the Executive Board. The members of the Supervi-
sory Board are reimbursed for their expenses and also
receive annual remuneration.

Executive Board Remuneration

Basic remuneration is paid as a monthly salary and
is performance related. An increase in salary of 1 %
p.a. was contractually agreed with members of the
Executive Board. Negotiations for salary adjust-
ments are conducted when inflation exceeds 3 %.
All members of the Executive Board also receive
payments in kind and other remuneration, includ-
ing the use of a company car, the reimbursement of
travel expenses, coverage of direct insurance premi-
ums, a personal pension and reimbursement of half
the documented premiums for voluntary health and
nursing care insurance.

Variable, Performance-based Remuneration

The variable remuneration model for members of
the Executive Board was developed further. The
additional model is based directly on the relevant
metrics EBITDA and earnings per share (EPS),
which are reported to adesso AG shareholders in
the IFRS consolidated financial statements accord-
ing. Variable remuneration increases with rising
EBITDA and EPS. From a watershed, the increase
is limited to EUR 60 thousand for the EBITDA
value and EUR 90 thousand for the EPS value.
One of two different variants, which are differen-
tiated by the rate of increase and watershed, can be

selected each year. Once a member of the Execu-
tive Board has chosen the EBITDA/EPS model,
they may not switch back to the existing model.
Two members of the Executive Board chose the
new model for 2014.

The existing model is based on the total plan
value of individual transactions according to local
accounting regulations. It is made up of three ele-
ments: Profit sharing, “variable remuneration
component 1” and “variable remuneration com-
ponent 2”. Profit sharing is based exclusively on
net income for the year before income taxes and
amortisation of goodwill for adesso Group accord-
ing to the respective national laws, without tak-
ing into account variable remuneration and profit
sharing for members of the Executive Board. The
sum of earnings generated by Group companies
that is relevant for Executive Board targets is used,
adjusted for items that do not conform with tar-
gets where applicable. Profit sharing is calculated
ona linear basis at 0 % to 25 % of basic remunera-
tion, depending on profitability, and is subject to
minimum earnings on the part of adesso Group.
The “variable remuneration component 1” is paid
out depending on the degree to which the annual
sales and profit targets are met. If the profit target
is not reached or the sales target is not achieved
to at least 80 %, no variable remuneration is paid.
If both targets are achieved to at least 80 %, vari-
able remuneration is determined according to
the following rules. For each percentage point
above the minimum target achievement of 80 %,
in reference to profit defined as net income for
the year before income taxes and amortisation of
goodwill for the adesso Group according to the
respective national laws, and without taking into
account variable remuneration and profit sharing
for members of the Executive Board, each member
of the Executive Board receives EUR 750 as the
variable remuneration component 1 limited to a
maximum target achievement of 130 % or a maxi-
mum amount of EUR 37,500. The sum of earnings
generated by group companies relevant for Execu-
tive Board targets, adjusted for items that do not
conform with targets where applicable, is used to
calculate profit sharing. The “variable remunera-
tion component 2” is paid out depending on the
degree to which targets are achieved within the
past four years and the current year. This takes
into account the objective of including a medium

to long-term component in Executive Board remu-
neration. “Variable remuneration component 2” is
calculated as the average of “variable remuneration
component 1” for the year under review and the
second-lowest of the past four years. In combina-
tion with variable remuneration for the respective
year, profit sharing is not permitted to exceed one-
fifth of the total profit for adesso.

Long-term Remuneration

A phantom share programme for certain members
of the Executive Board and employees at the first
management level of adesso AG was approved by
the Supervisory Board in financial year 2009. It was
intended to help bind managers to the company in
the long term. The phantom shares participate in
dividends just like actual shares but the payments
are included in salaries. After being with the com-
pany for a term of five to eight years, the holders
of phantom shares have a right to receive the value
represented at the time by the number of phantom
shares and the underlying share price. Payment is
included in salaries. The members of the Execu-
tive Board obtained additional rights from these
phantom shares in 2014. In case a board member
leaves the Executive Board, the following has been
established with regard to the phantom share pro-
gramme: If a board member leaves before the end
of three years from the start of the programme (for
one board member, three years and eight months)
due to termination of contract, the board mem-
ber only has to return the shares in exchange for
compensation in case of a change of control. This
is the case if shareholders Rainer Rudolf and Prof.
Dr. Volker Gruhn (or companies through which
they hold their shares) hold less than 35 % of the
company’s share capital through the sum of their
shares. If a board member leaves after at least three
years (for one board member, three years and eight
months) due to the termination of their contract
or if the company fails to make a contract renewal
offer at terms and conditions at least equivalent to
those of the current contract, the board member has
to return the shares. Compensation is 75 % of the
applicable value. If a board member leaves after at
least eight years (for one board member, six years
and eight months), the shares have to be returned
in exchange for compensation.

The share option programme of adesso AG duly
expired on 31 December 2013. In view of the

Annual Report 2014

granted stock options, the Executive Board will
receive virtual stock options from the financial year
2014. The aim of the virtual stock options is that
they are financially equal to option rights when
post-tax income is used for subscribing the virtual
stock options in order to buy adesso AG shares
on the market. The same conditions apply to vir-
tual stock options as for stock options granted by
the programme expiring on 31 December 2013.
The number of virtual stock options issued to the
Executive Board depends on the variable perfor-
mance-based remuneration component, which
means it is also performance-based. The virtual
stock options only result in cash value compensa-
tion if the exercise criteria are met after the end of
the minimum holding period. 140 virtual stock
options are granted for each EUR 1,000 paid as the
performance-based variable remuneration compo-
nent 1 fora year. The virtual stock options remain
valid even ifa board member leaves before exercising
the virtual stock options.

Former members of the Executive Board do not
receive any remuneration, nor were any pension com-
mitments made. No loans or advances were granted
to members of the Executive Board.

Supervisory Board Remuneration

According to Section 11 of the bylaws, the members
of the Supervisory Board are reimbursed for their
expenses and also receive annual remuneration. This
consists of a fixed component of EUR 5S thousand
plus variable remuneration at a rate of 0.275 %o of
the company’s balance sheet profit, reduced by 4 % of
contributions to share capital. The chairman receives
one anda half times this remuneration. Supervisory
Board members who have not held their position for
a full financial year receive remuneration according to
their term in office. The chairperson of the Supervi-
sory Board receives additional remuneration under a
consulting and brokerage agreement.

adesso AG has neither granted loans or advances to
members of the Supervisory Board nor issued bonds
or guarantees on their behalf. There are no family
ties between members of the Supervisory Board,
nor between members of the Supervisory Board
and the Executive Board. There are no service agree-
ments between the Supervisory Board members and
adesso or its subsidiaries that call for remuneration
upon termination.

For further information regarding Supervisory
Board and Executive Board remuneration, including
detailed tables regarding individual remuneration of
Supervisory Board and Executive Board members,
