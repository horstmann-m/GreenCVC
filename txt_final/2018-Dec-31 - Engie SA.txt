1.1 Profile, organization and strategy of the Group

1.1.1 General presentation

The ENGIE group is a global reference group in low-carbon energy and
services. To respond to the climate emergency, its ambition is to
become the world leader in the zero carbon transition of its customers,
in particular businesses and local authorities. We rely on our key
businesses (renewable, gas, services) to offer competitive turnkey
solutions “as a service".

Decarbonization and digitization are continuing, while decentralization is
accelerating: local authorities and companies must now respond to
climate change and the zero-carbon imperative. It is a complex
challenge requiring cost-efficient, proactive investment to improve
stakeholder quality of life, driving new demands on energy industry
players to enable these transitions. The development of client solutions,
low carbon generation and infrastructure, together with a bold plan for
asset rotation (see Section 1.1.5 “Transformation plan”) has transformed
the Group and positioned it as a pioneer of zero carbon integrated
solutions.

The ENGIE head office is located at 1, place Samuel de Champlain,
92400 Courbevoie, France. The telephone number is
+33 (0) 1 44 22.00 00. ENGIE is listed in the Nanterre Trade and
Companies Register under reference number 542 107 651. Its NAF
(French business sector) code is 35232.

ENGIE is a public limited liability company (société anonyme) with a
Board of Directors and is subject to the laws and regulations governing
public limited companies and any specific laws governing the Company,
and to its by-laws.

Listed in Paris and Brussels, ENGIE is represented in the major stock
indices (see Section 5.1.1.1 “Share capital and voting rights”)

1.1.2 History and evolution of the Company

The Company is the result of the merger-absorption of SUEZ by Gaz de
France, following the decisions of the Combined General Shareholders’
Meetings of Gaz de France and SUEZ of July 16, 2008. The merger
took effect on July 22, 2008.

Initially incorporated in 1946 as an EPIC (French public industrial and
commercial enterprise), it became a limited liability company with a
99-year term under Law 2004-803 of August 9, 2004, on the public
service of electricity and gas and electricity and gas companies
(amending Law 46-628 of April 8, 1946) the provisions of which were
aimed at organizing the change in the Company's legal status.

On July 7, 2005, the Company publicly floated its shares on the stock
market. The Company's shares, under its former name, Gaz de France,
were first listed on July 7, 2005.

Law 2004-803 of August 9, 2004, as amended by Law 2006-1537 of
December 7, 2006, governing the energy sector and Decree 2007-1784
of December 19, 2007, authorized the transfer of the Company from the
public to the private sector. On July 22, 2008, the Company absorbed
SUEZ in a merger which entailed transferring the majority of the
Company's share capital to the private sector. The new Company took
the name “GDF SUEZ”.

SUEZ itself was the result of the merger in 1997 of Compagnie de Suez
and Lyonnaise des Eaux. At the time, Compagnie de Suez — which had
built and operated the Suez Canal until its nationalization by the
Egyptian government in 1956 - was a holding company with diversified
investments in Belgium and France, particularly in the finance and
energy sectors. Lyonnaise des Eaux was a diversified company
specializing in the management and treatment of water, waste,
construction, communications and plant and equipment management.
SUEZ became an international industrial and services group whose

objective was to meet essential requirements in electricity, gas, energy
and industry services, water and waste management.

The deregulation of European energy markets in the early 1990s
accelerated the international development of both Gaz de France and
SUEZ, which progressively expanded their activities beyond their
respective traditional markets, both in Europe and internationally.

On February 3, 2011, the Company completed a merger with
International Power. In 2012, it reaffirmed its strategy to become a
leading player on the global energy market, finalizing the purchase of
shares held by the minority shareholders of International Power on
dune 29, 2012.

The SUEZ Environnement Company shareholders’ agreement expired
on July 22, 2013, and was not renewed. The cooperation and shared
functions agreement and the financing agreement between the
Company and SUEZ Environnement Company have also come to an
end. The Company now uses the equity method to consolidate SUEZ
Environnement Company's activities in its financial statements, rather
than full consolidation.

The Company intends to maintain its role as a long-term strategic
partner of SUEZ (formerly SUEZ Environnement Company) and as its
majority shareholder. The guiding principles of the industrial and
commercial agreements between the Company and SUEZ
Environnement Company were confirmed in January 2013, and formed
the basis of a framework agreement between the two companies,
similar to an agreement that would have been concluded with a third
party outside the Group. These principles relate to reciprocal preference,
under market conditions, in purchasing/sales, continuing cooperation in
certain industrial activities, development of potential joint commercial
offerings and cooperation in sustainable development, innovation and
research and development.

In early March 2016, the two companies signed an agreement providing
for the contribution by ENGIE to SUEZ (formerly SUEZ Environnement
Company) of all of the share capital of SUEZ IP, which owns all
intellectual property rights related to the SUEZ brand. The main terms.
and conditions of this transaction as set out in the contribution
agreement are detailed in Section 4.1.7 “Statutory Auditors’ special
report on regulated agreements and commitments.

Presentation of the Group
1.1 Profile, organization and strategy of the Group

On July 29, 2015, the Extraordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting
approved a change in the Company name, and adopted “ENGIE” as its
new legal name.

The name of the share listed on the stock market was also changed to
ENGIE, and its ISIN code changed to “ENGI”, with effect from July 31, 2015.

1.1.3. Organization

In response to the challenge of the global energy revolution and in order
to get closer to its customers, on January 1, 2016, ENGIE put in place a
simplified structure based on a regional and decentralized approach.
The Group now comprises 23 operating entities (Business Units, or
BUs)", five Métiers and a range of support functions and operational
functions (see the Group organizational chart on the next page).

Most of the BUs are constituted to manage operations for a country or
group of countries, depending on the density of the activities carried out
in the geographical areas concerned. They bring together the Group’s
activities to meet the expectations of their customers and stakeholders.
in a given area.

= The following were therefore created:

= 11 geographical BUs, in Europe and worldwide (Africa; North
America; Latin America; Asia Pacific; Benelux; Brazil; China;
North, South and Eastern Europe; Middle East, South and Central
Asia, and Turkey; UK and Generation Europe) responsible for the
central management of all Group activities within their region;

= France has a special structure, given its size and the presence of
regulated entities. It has eight BUs, four that specialize in gas
infrastructure (transmission, distribution, terminals and storage)
and four related to the BtoB, BtoC, networks and renewable
energy businesses;

— lastly, in addition to the operational entities, there are four global
BUs with worldwide scope: Hydrogen; Global Energy
Management; Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT); and Tractebel.

Each of these BUs is represented on the Group Executive Committee by
an Executive Vice President, who oversees it.

Five Métiers have been created in addition to this geographical
structure: gas value chain; centralized generation; decentralized
solutions for cities and territories; solutions for businesses; and solutions
for residentials and professionals.

The support functions and the operational functions complete the
organization. They aim to reinforce the action of the Métiers to develop
synergies within the Group and support the BUs.

= The support functions are as follows: General Secretariat; Finance
Department; Group Human Resources Department; Group Strategy
Department; Group Brand and Communication Department; Group
Digital and IT Department; Corporate Social Responsibility
Department; Group Real Estate Department; Risk Management
Department; Transformation Department; Integration Department;
and Functional Departments reporting to the Chief Executive Officer
(Internal Audit Department and France Institutions and Territories
Department).

= The operational functions are as follows: Strategic Sourcing & Supply
Department; ENGIE Research; ENGIE Fab; Integration Management
Office; Business Development Oversight Department; Industrial
Projects Oversight & Support Department; and Nuclear Development
Department.

The Métiers, the support functions and the operational functions are
grouped within the scope of Corporate.

In addition, the Global Business Support entity groups together the
Group's Shared Service Centers in France and Belgium. It covers seven
functional areas: general procurement and IT, finance, human resources,
real estate and logistics, information systems, and internal consulting
and legal.

The Company operates its own business. At the end of 2018, the
number of subsidiaries directly or indirectly controlled by the Company
was 2,800. In addition to the lists provided in Section 6.2.2
“Consolidated financial statements - Note 2 Main subsidiaries at
December 31, 2018” and Section 6.4.2 “Parent company financial
statements — Note 4.4 Subsidiaries and affiliates”, a list of subsidiaries
can be found on the Group's website (www.engie.com, “Investors”
section).

The presentation of the Company's activities and the strategic economic
assets of its main subsidiaries as well as their geographical location are
presented in Section 1.3 “Description of the Group's activities”.

(1) There is also a twenty-fourth BU comprising the holding and corporate activities, including the entities responsible for the Group's centralized financing

and the contribution of the associate company SUEZ.

1.1.4 Strategic priorities

Transformations faced by markets in which the Group is expanding are
becoming more and more concrete as the second wave of energy
transition is emerging:

= Decarbonization and digitization are continuing;

@ A second wave in the energy transition is emerging: local authorities
and companies must now respond to climate change and the
zero-carbon imperative. Especially, the world’s top 500 global
companies which, far more than in the past, seek global strategy and
implementation planning to address their sustainability and zero
carbon requirements;

= Customer transition roadmaps increasingly require a sophisticated
integration of strategy, design, engineering, energy-efficient asset
construction, digital platforms, operations management, financing
syndication and outcome assurance.

Over the past three years, the ENGIE Group has undergone a deep
transformation, by focusing its development on three core activities: gas,
renewable energies and energy efficiency, while firmly positioning itself in
innovative activities (green mobility and smart grids in particular). This
transformation has allowed ENGIE to return to organic growth and
establish itself as a leader in the competitive energy transition.

ENGIE’s ambition is to be the world leader in the growing market for
integrated zero-carbon solutions.

During the Capital Markets Day which took place on the 28" of February
2019, the Group presented its ambitions strategic orientations for the
2019-2021 period which articulate around 3 priorities:

= to be the world leader in the growing market for integrated
zero-carbon solutions targeting local authorities and companies:
ENGIE's unique capability to integrate all these solution elements “as
a service” (strategy, design, etc.) to its customers affords the Group a
distinctive leadership position in the industry. Especially among
Fortune 500 companies, ENGIE is seizing industry leadership with
comprehensive 360° programs that cater to these companies with an
approach that is strategically focused, cost-efficient and subject to
robust performance management;

= to adopt an aligned approach to higher value activity across
business lines:

= in Clients Solutions, accelerating growth across a broadening
array of services including on-site co-generation, heating and
cooling networks, public lighting, rooftop solar and EV charging
stations. In a concrete way these solutions will integrate the
financing of the equipments of the companies and the Cities
and Territories

= in Networks, the Group will continue to generate attractive
returns and substantial cash flow. In France, the next regulatory
return review will be effective in 2020, and ENGIE will continue
to invest in the sustainability of its gas networks, adapting to
future green gas requirements. ENGIE will also actively seek
attractive opportunities to invest in the growth and energy
transition management of networks in dynamic developing
markets;

in Renewables, ENGIE is further scaling its design of complex,
multi-source, profiled power purchase agreements (PPAs) and
24/7 green energy flows which are now widely sought. Over
the longer term, ENGIE will play a leading role in next
generation renewable platforms including offshore wind and
green gas. ENGIE targets 50% of new renewable projects
dedicated to specific customers by 2021, to be a leading
corporate PPA supplier, and to be the world leader in 24/7

Presentation of the Group
1.1 Profile, organization and strategy of the Group

green PPAs. The Group plans to add 9 GW of renewables
capacity to its portfolio by 2021;

= in its other generation businesses, ENGIE will continue to
optimize operations, reducing its CO, footprint. ENGIE will
further narrow its thermal capacity, reducing coal generation
and selectively honing gas-fired capacity to customer
requirements, including combined technologies such as
desalination and co-generation. ENGIE’s Belgian nuclear
operations continue to stabilize, with operational availability
anticipated to rise as previously announced;

= in Supply, ENGIE is continuing to increase its consumer and
business contract base, driven by innovative offers and
improving service quality. The profitability of this growing
customer base is forecast to be offset by industry margin
pressure in the consumer segment, and in this context
ENGIE's strategic ambitions in this segment remain limited to
our current country footprint.

= to leverage key digital technology and financing syndication
capabilities:

= the Group has deployed global digital platforms that strengthen
our competitiveness, and will continue to scale up software
content in ENGIE's solutions to differentiate us as the leading
energy software provider;
= with an industry-leading flow of customer projects, a strong
infrastructure investor relationship network and systematic,
proprietary structuring capabilities, ENGIE designs financing
syndication as an integrated part of our solutions, optimizing
customers’ cost of capital and ENGIE's ability to accelerate its
growth with lower individual project capital intensity. This model
has been utilized over time in ENGIE’s thermal and renewables
portfolios, and will now be implemented across our Client
Solutions and other innovation project pipelines.
The Group adopts selective offer and investment criteria: prioritization
of 20 countries, 30 urban areas but also simplifies financial reporting.

ENGIE applies rigorous strategic and financial investment criteria, and
has a clear perspective on attractive investment characteristics.
Complex, innovative, integrated, longer-term, outcome-based customer
programs are preferred to simple, commoditized, standard
fee-for-service business. Investment will be differentiated over distinct
time horizons, with consistent hurdles of 200 bps over ENGIE's WACC,
and 400 bps over cost of equity.

In a move to sharpen geographic focus and capital allocation, 20
countries and 30 major developing market urban areas have been
identified as ENGIE's top investment-led growth priorities, with an
objective to build scale, top-3 positions and higher density of operations.
ENGIE will also exit approximately 20 countries over the next three years
in a move to enhance focus and economic returns.

In addition, ENGIE's financial reporting will be simplified, with fewer
geographic segments and strategic visibility into the progress of each
Global Business Line and our energy Supply operations.

ENGIE expects to invest approximately €11-12 billion in growth over
the 2019-2021 period.

ENGIE intends to invest approximately €4 billion annually in growth
capital expenditures and smaller bolt-on acquisitions over the
2019-2021 period, while €6 billion of asset disposals are expected over
the period. This €11-12 billion program is anticipated to be led by €4-5
billion for Client Solutions. €2.3-2.8 billion will be allocated to
Renewables growth to fuel the c. 9GW of incremental capacity, while

1.1 Profile, organization and strategy of the Group

€3.0-3.3 billion of additional capital will be invested in our Networks
business line.

ENGIE will drive continuing internal cost reduction and improved
profitability.

A further 2019-2021 performance program has been launched,
consisting of cost reduction initiatives (spanning procurement,
digitalization and shared service centers) and revenue and margin
enhancement opportunities stemming from optimization of ENGIE’s
assets and customer offers. The aggregate operating profit impact of
the program is currently targeted at €800 million, with delivery weighted
slightly towards 2020 and 2021.

ENGIE’s indicative profit growth expectations point to sustained
acceleration.

Based upon key assumptions, an ENGIE Group EBITDA CAGR of
3.5-6% is expected over the 2018-2021 period. ENGIE Group CO! is
expected to accelerate to a CAGR of 6.5-8.5% over the same period,
predicated on indicative business line COI growth expectations of:

= Client Solutions: 11-14% CAGR, driven by revenue acceleration and
more profitable asset-based Solutions;

= Networks: (4%) — (1%) CAGR, given a regulatory review of French
infrastructure returns in 2020 and growth expectations in other
markets;

= Renewables: 8-11% CAGR, driven by commissioning of 9GW of
additional capacity by 2021 and increasing complexity and profitability
of our customer activities;

= Thermal: (6%) — (3%) excluding the impact of the disposal of Glow,
given continuing generation portfolio optimization, with disposals
focused on contracted coal plants and selected merchant assets;

= Nuclear: expectation of a stemming of losses and COI neutrality by
2021;

= Supply: expectations of approximately flat COI over the period.

ENGIE's financial objective is to offer its shareholders attractive returns
while maintaining a solid financial structure and robust cash flow
generation (see 6.1.1.1.3 “2019 financial targets”).

Group net debt: the Group forecasts financial net debt of approximately
€20 billion at the end of 2021 (ratio to EBITDA of <2.5x) and economic:
net debt in the range of €35-37 billion (ratio to EBITDA of <4.0x) at that
time, and ENGIE reaffirms its current commitment to the retention of its
‘A’ debt rating. These debt forecasts assume no change in the existing
Belgian nuclear provision legal and regulatory framework.

To become more agile and adapt to the changes in its environment, the
Group began implementing an ambitious human resources action plan
in 2014.

This involves creating conditions that enable it to deliver its strategy
while making individual and collective concerns a central part of its
transformation. The action plan was implemented in three strategic
areas:

= culture and leadership: centralized responsibility, innovation and
performance;

= the adaptation of skills and Métiers to customer and digital solutions;
= agile organization, project mode and continuous improvement.

Within ENGIE, environmental and societal responsibility plays an integral
part in the business strategy, through the development of:

= sustainable business, which involves identifying environmental and
societal issues and transforming them into opportunities for the
Group's businesses;

= the management of ESG risks, which involves managing the risks
associated with the Group's activities and facilities that relate to the
environment, local and international acceptability, health and safety,
human resources management, ethics and governance.

ENGIE has formalized its commitments, primarily through the publication
of its environmental and societal responsibility policy in 2014. In early
May 2016, ENGIE announced its commitment to six new non-financial
targets for 2020 (see 1.2.2. “CSR indicators”)

Against this background of transformation, ethics and the safety of
people are core elements of any Group's activity.

1.1.5 Transformation plan

In February 2016, ENGIE announced an ambitious three-year
transformation plan to accelerate its shift in strategy, adapt its portfolio
of activities to its long-term vision and deploy its development priorities.
At the end of 2018, this plan is now complete.

The first pillar of the transformation plan involved redesigning and
streamlining the portfolio, based on:

= a portfolio rotation program (€15 billion net debt impact targeted over
2016-2018). The Group has already recorded sales of €14 billion to
which 2.6 billion can be added early 2019 following the sale of Engie's
stake in Glow, Thailand, for a total of €16.5 billion in disposals ;

= an investment program (€15 billion growth CAPEX over 2016-2018,
including €1 billion CAPEX on innovation and digital). AT the end of
2018, €16.1 billion have been recorded (€14.3 billion net of disposals
under the DBpSO activity in the renewable).

The second pillar entailed investment in technological innovation,
business models and digital transformation, to prepare for the future.

ENGIE's operational efficiency and competitiveness were central to the
third pillar of the transformation plan. The new performance program,

1.1.6 Highlights of 2018

Renewables and Thermal contracted power activities

In France, the Group confirmed its N°1 position in solar and wind power
by winning 230 MW in the latest governmental call for tenders and by
acquiring a portfolio of 1.8 GW of projects (acquisition of LANGA, 1.3
GW; acquisition of SAMEOLE, 500 MW). In addition, FEIH company
(jointly owned by ENGIE and Crédit Agricole Assurances), reached 1.5
GW of solar and wind installed power capacity by the beginning of
2019.

In the United States, ENGIE acquired Infinity Renewables and hence
became a leader in the development of wind farms. The company has.
already developed 1.6 GW of capacity and has a portfolio of 8 GW of
projects at various stages of development. In India, the Group opened
the Mirzapur solar farm and reached 1 GW of renewable capacities
(solar and wind, installed or in construction) by winning a new 200 MW.
wind project. In Spain, the Group is developing, together with partners,
9 wind farms for a total capacity of 300 MW. In Senegal, ENGIE has.
been attributed the development of 2 solar parks for a total capacity of
60 MW.

ENGIE has mobilized its expertise to provide customers with complex
renewable solutions, either through specific technology or tailor-made
solutions. In offshore wind power in France, two ENGIE projects (Le
Tréport and Yeu-Noirmoutier islands) were confirmed in July 2018 by
the President of the Republic; the first authorizations were obtained in
October for the Yeu and Noirmoutier islands project and on February
26", 2019 for the Dieppe — le Tréport wind offshore project.

In early 2019, ENGIE commissioned the Kathu thermodynamic solar
power plant, one of South Africa's largest renewable energy projects.

Presentation of the Group
1.1 Profile, organization and strategy of the Group

Lean 2018, was launched in January 2016 to bring about long-term
improvements in the Group's performance. It initially aimed to achieve
recurring cost savings with a net aggregate impact on EBITDA of
€1 billion by 2018. This objective was raised to €1.3 billion in savings,
which was reached at the end of 2018, with in particular €304 million of
gains in 2018. To achieve their objectives, adapted to their situations
BUs have used three main families of levers: operations, support
functions and purchasing.

During the Capital Markets Day of February 28, 2019, the Group
announced a new performance plan, Lean 2021, covering the period
2019-2021. The overall expected impact of the Lean 2021 program is
currently set at € 800 million, with a slightly weighted result around 2020
and 2021

The fourth pillar involved transforming ENGIE internally to make the
Group more agile and connected, to attract future talent and to create
an environment that fosters career development.

This thermodynamic concentrated solar power plant (CSP) has a
capacity of 100 MW and allows, via a molten salt storage system, to
store 4.5 hours of autonomy.

The Group announced it will develop small-scale solar power plants,
partnering with SUEZ to install photovoltaic solar parks on each of its
waste storage and recycling facilities in France for a total estimated
capacity of 1 GW, and partnering with GreenYellow to address areas
such as roofs and parking lots. In addition, in Norway, ENGIE has.
signed the financial agreements for a 208 MW wind farm project whose
energy will be sold to the aluminum manufacturer Hydro under the terms
of a 25-year contract.

In Mexico and in Chile, the Group developed its BtoB green electricity
offer and signed a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with steel
producer Gerdau. The electricity thus delivered will come from new
supply contracts backed by a 130 MW photovoltaic power plant.

Finally, ENGIE is completing the sale of its entire stake in Glow in
Asia-Pacific, and thus will cease its coal-fired power plant operations in
the region

Infrastructure activities

In France, in Dunkirk, the Group inaugurated the first pilot to inject green
hydrogen to the gas distribution network (GRHYD project), and
announced that it will mobilize EUR 800 million over the next five years
to develop green gases.

In Brazil, the Group signed the concession contract for the Gralha Azul
electric transmission line.

with Arval to launch in Europe a new green electric mobility offer in
which ENGIE will install and maintain charging points. In early 2019, in
Chile, the Group signed a contract to supply an initial phase of 100
electric buses to the city of Santiago.

In the Campus & Universities market, ENGIE won a major contract in the
UK for the renovation and management of buildings at the University of
Kingston in London. Besides, in the US, to serve the Longwood Medical
Campus in Boston, the Group acquired a micro-grid for electricity, heat
and cooling

In order to provide solutions adapted to the needs of retail consumers,
ENGIE has enriched its solar self-consumption offer in France with a
modular solution of batteries that can be combined with photovoltaic
panels, and launched its 1 euro efficient gas boiler offer dedicated to
under privileged households. Besides, the Group also invested in
HomeBiogas, an Israeli start-up that has developed a digester that
allows individuals, in various countries, to transform their organic waste

into green cooking gas and liquid fertilizer. Finally, with the acquisition of
Vol-V Biomasse, ENGIE becomes the leading biomethane producer in
France.

1.1.7. Competitive positioning

Electricity production and marketing and gas marketing are business
sectors that are largely open to competition in Europe. However, they
are still regulated differently according to the country, particularly with
regard to residential energy prices. Activities that constitute natural
monopolies — such as the transmission and distribution of electricity and,
to a large extent, of gas - are more tightly controlled by national
regulators and European rules.

Elsewhere in the world, with few exceptions, private companies often
operate under long-term contracts issued on a tender basis.

ENGIE is a European and world leader in the areas of electricity and
natural gas:

@ ENGIE is one of the top gas sellers and importers in Europe;

= The Group is the leading gas infrastructure operator in Europe with a
portfolio that includes a transmission network, distribution networks,
and LNG storage and terminals;

= In renewable electricity, ENGIE is a key player in international tenders,
particularly in Latin America and the Middle East, with strong positions
in Brazil, Peru, Mexico and Chile. The Group is one of the leading
power producers in Europe;

= Via some 21 million contracts, ENGIE provides gas and electricity to
end customers worldwide, nearly half of which are located outside
France.

Presentation of the Group
1.1 Profile, organization and strategy of the Group

This global and European leadership is fortified by the Group's deep
French-Belgian roots:

@ In France, ENGIE is the historic leader of gas marketing and the
second-largest producer and supplier of electricity. In renewable
energy, ENGIE is the second-largest hydropower operator in France
and the number one wind and solar energy company in the country;

In Belgium, ENGIE, through its subsidiary Electrabel, is the leading
producer and supplier of electricity and supplier of natural gas.

The Group is also one of the European leaders in BtoB energy services
in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Italy. ENGIE also
holds strong positions in Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom in
heat networks and facility management. It is supported by its
development bases in Central Europe, Asia, North America, Latin
America, the Middle East, and Africa. The Group is the European leader
in energy efficiency services, number two in installation and ninth in
integrated services. Worldwide, ENGIE ranks third for heating networks
(in TWh) and first for cooling networks.

In terms of new activities, ENGIE has taken a leadership position in each
of the new distributed generation segments (first in microgrids and
isolated microgrids) and in solar units for industrial and commercial
customers.

In green mobility, ENGIE ranks second in the world in terms of the
number of electric vehicle charging points installed, and seventh for
charging points for natural gas vehicles.

(1) These competitive positions are established on the basis of specialist work within the Group, carried out using available information published by
stakeholders or entities providing external analysis (Bloomberg and Global Data).

1.2.2 CSR indicators

The Group's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is based on
quantified, time-specific targets and an overall assessment organized
around different monitoring methods (indicators, reporting, performance
reviews and CSR rating indices).

The Board of Directors’ Ethics, Environment and Sustainable
Development Committee (“EESDC") defines the scope of the policies
undertaken, the outlooks and the action plans in the area of Corporate
Social Responsibility. The Executive Committee makes key decisions in
this area (see Section 4 “Corporate governance’). The role of the CSR.
Executive Committee is to prepare annual action plans, monitor their
implementation, gather feedback from the various entities and
encourage exchange regarding major strategies.

ASR report is submitted every year to the Executive Committee for
approval and future direction, then to the EESDC to provide a progress
report on the policy's implementation and the achievement of Group
CSR objectives.

Presentation of the Group
1.2 Key figures

In response to changes in the energy sector and to the gradual
integration of environmental and societal aspects into stakeholder
requirements, ENGIE set itself six new CSR goals in 2016 to be
achieved by 2020:

= an 85% satisfaction rate among its BtoC customers;

= a 25% share of renewable energy in the Group's electricity production
capacity portfolio;

= a 20% reduction in the CO, emissions ratio for energy production
compared to 2012;

= 100% of the Group's industrial activities to be covered by an
appropriate stakeholder dialogue and consultation mechanism, based
on regular meetings with the relevant NGOs and non-profits, and on the
development of long-term partnerships related to the Group's activities;

= 25% of Group's workforce to be made up of women;

= and an internal workplace accident frequency rate of below 3.

The 2016-2018 results for the CSR indicators are presented in the following table:

Theme Indicators 2020 objective  2016results 2017 results 2018 results

Customer satisfaction Satisfaction rate of BtoC customers > 85% 81% 83% 81%

(1) Consolidated at 100%

(2) Scope 1 specific CO; eq. emissions of entities controlled and operated by the Group (environmental reporting)

(3) kg COz eq./MWh.
(4) Scope 2015

The Group achieved a global satisfaction rate among its BtoC
customers of 81% in the 13 main countries in which the Group has a
commercial presence with private or professional customers. The slight
decrease compared to 2017 is due to a methodological change in
customer inquiries that are practiced more and more by email than by
telephone.

Regarding environmental targets, in 2018 ENGIE posted a 0.6%
increase year-over-year in its installed renewable energy capacity mix
and a 10.6% decrease in its specific CO, emissions (see Section 3.5.4.1
“Climate change"). The Group's goal of reducing specific CO, emissions
by 20% is reached two years in advance due to the current exit of
carbon assets. Installed coal-fired generation capacity amounted to 7.2
GW at the end of 2018, down 7.9 GW compared with the end of 2015
and representing no more than 6.9% of the Group's installed capacity
(at 100%).

The roll-out of the mechanism for structured dialogue with stakeholders
continued in 2018, leading to a percentage of the Group's industrial
activities that comply with the standards related to this dialogue to 53%,
in progress by comparison with 2017.

ENGIE posted in 2018 a 21.1% rate of gender diversity in its workforce,
down slightly compared to 2017, and an 3.4 employee accident
frequency rate, up slightly over 2017 (see Section 3.4.6 “Health and
safety policy”). The Group's sales and acquisitions related to its desire to
accelerate its business transformation have had a significant impact on
these two indicators.

With regard to its investment plans, the Group uses a number of criteria,
including ethics, CO, emissions, social impact, human resources,
environmental management of ecosystems, cooperation with
stakeholders, local procurement, and health and safety. The Group also
takes into account an internal carbon price when deciding on new
projects.

The Group's social reporting (see Section 3.4), environmental reporting
(see Section 3.5), and societal reporting (see Section 3.6) are used to
publish a set of indicators that are verified by an independent third party
(see Section 3.8)

In terms of ESG ratings, ENGIE’s CSR performance was again
recognized by ESG agency RobecoSAM, which confirmed the Group's
membership of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) World and
Europe in 2018. The 2018 assessment positions the Group as industry
leader in its sector (Multi and Water Utilities) with a rating of 82 out of
100.

1.3 Description of the Group's activities

= EV Chong (25% owned by ENGIE via investment closed mid of 2018)
has developed 2 main businesses: 1) Services to Electrical Vehicles
charging stations, including development, installation and O&M; and
2) a “battery as services” offer for captive EV fleets;

= SFES, a JV (40% ENGIE, 60% Chongqing Gas Group) which
operates and develops DHC projects in Chongqing area;

= YUECHI, a single project JV (49% ENGIE, 51% Sichuan Energy
Investment Company - SCEI) which develops and operates a steam
power cogeneration project in Sichuan Province;

= ETS, a service-oriented JV (50% ENGIE, 50% SCE), based in
Chengdu city - Sichuan Province, which provides O&M (Yuechi) and
technical energy advisory services.

On top of the above activities, ENGIE, through Tractebel, owns 49% of
an engineering JV called BUGET (61% Beiran Enterprise Company),
based in Beijing.

On May 31, 2018, China's national policy makers jointly released a
policy document with immediate execution on the same day. The policy
restricts new solar installations that require national subsidy (mostly
ground mounted projects) and reduces the subsidy of new distributed
PV projects by 0.05 RMB/kWh.

Even if the policy came out without any warning, the impact is limited on
ENGIE China's overall strategy since UNISUN has started a strategy
shift towards distributed wind

This new regulation obviously slows down the development of new solar
photovoltaic projects, and has caused a drop in the price of solar
panels.

1.3.7. Infrastructures Europe

The Infrastructures Europe reportable segment groups together the
activities of four BUs: GRTgaz, GRDF, Elengy, and Storengy. These BUs
develop, operate and maintain - primarily in France and Germany —
natural gas transmission, storage, and distribution networks and
facilities, along with LNG terminals. They also sell access rights to these
infrastructures to third parties.

The GRTgaz, GRDF, Elengy and Storengy operating segments, which
comprise the gas infrastructure businesses in Europe (distribution,
transport, storage, and LNG terminals), have been grouped together
within the Infrastructures Europe reportable segment as they are all
regulated businesses (or businesses likely to be regulated) with similar
risk profiles and margins.

1.3.7.1.1 Role & Strategy

GRTgaz is an independent subsidiary of ENGIE. In addition to GRTgaz
employees who own 0.35% of the capital of their company, GRTgaz
shareholders are ENGIE and Société d'Infrastructures Gaziéres (SIG), a
consortium composed of CNP Assurances, CDC Infrastructures and
Caisse des Dépéts. ENGIE and the SIG respectively own 75% and 25%
of the remaining share of the capital.

GRTgaz develops, operates and maintains the main gas transmission
network in France, manages the natural gas flows that flow through it,
and markets network access services to gas suppliers. It manages gas
transmission operations in Germany through its GRTgaz Deutschland
subsidiary. In 2017, GRTgaz acquired ENGIE subsidiary Elengy, which
operates LNG terminals in France.

GRTgaz's strategy is to ensure the company's development in the long
term both in France and internationally. GRTgaz is intent on:

= being a leader in gas infrastructure in Europe, in particular by
contributing to better integration of the European markets;

= being a driving force in the energy transition, particularly by promoting
new uses of natural gas (industry/mobility), developing renewable
natural gas by injecting biomethane into the transmission network,
and conducting research on monetizing surplus renewable energy
(power-to-gas);

= continuing to expand internationally in countries where natural gas
consumption is growing fast, in close collaboration with other
Group entities.

1.3.7.1.2 Description of activities

In France, it owns and operates more than 32,000 km of buried pipeline
and 26 compression stations to take gas from suppliers to consumers.
(distributors or manufacturers directly connected to the transmission
network). GRTgaz has a public service mandate to guarantee the
continuous supply of gas to consumers. It also sells transmission
services to network users. GRTgaz plays an active role in the energy
transition, investing in innovative solutions to adapt its network
accordingly and combine competitiveness and security of supply with
environmental protection.

GRTgaz's business is conducted within a general framework designed
to guarantee the independence of the grid manager.

natural gas transmission pipelines are subject to a specific and
non-transferable authorization issued by the competent administrative
body. Pursuant to its ruling of December 15, 2016, the French Energy
Regulation Commission (CRE) defined the methodology and set the
tariffs for the use of transmission networks in France known as “ATRT 6,”
which entered into force in April 2017 for a period of around four years. A
revision clause at the end of two years allows an adjustment of the
blueprint for net operating expenses under certain conditions.

The new tariff set by the CRE provides GRTgaz with all the resources.
needed to respond to the challenges of energy transition and takes
account of the changes in the gas market. The CRE is also
strengthening the GRTgaz performance incentives and the incentive
scheme for the creation of more selective interconnection capacity.

This new framework was supposed to result in a 0.4% reduction in the
average unit tariff over the ATRT6 period, as a result of various factors:

first, the erosion of the subscriptions anticipated over the period and
the commissioning of significant investment projects;

= and second, a drop in energy prices, a decrease in the weighted
average cost of capital from 6.5% to 5.25% (real before taxes), and
efficiency targets set for GRTgaz.

Within this framework, and in application of the methodology, the tariff
update led to an increase of 3.0% in the average tariff on April 1, 2018
(CRE ruling of February 7, 2018) related primarily to the creation of the
single market place in France.

1.3.7.2 GRDF

1.3.7.2.1 Role & Strategy

In France, GRDF, independent subsidiary of ENGIE, develops, operates
and maintains the distribution networks, delivers gas for suppliers and
consumers, and connects biomethane producers to the network. GRDF
is tasked with giving all natural gas suppliers equal access to its network.

Its strategy is revised every four years. In 2018, GRDF developed its
activities according to the three objectives stated in its enterprise
project, covering the period from 2015 to 2018:

= strive for operational excellence in the performance of its business
lines to be recognized as a committed professional;

28 ENGIE 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT


--- Page 24 ---

= make natural gas an energy of the future by demonstrating its
relevance in the energy mix;

= build a responsible, more open and collaborative business model with
all the business lines.

1.3.7.2.2 Description of activities

The distribution activity has specific features related to its classification as
a local utility. Each municipality where natural gas supply is available grants
a concession to an authorized distributor to operate the natural gas utility
in its territory. Concessions are entered into or renewed based on
standard specifications established jointly by the French national federation
of concession-granting and state-controlled municipalities (FNCCR) and
GRDF. Concession-granting bodies exercise control to ensure the proper
execution of the obligations resulting from these specifications.

Distribution structures belong to the municipalities even when they are
built and financed by the concession operator, who has an exclusive right
to use them. The Energy Code recognizes the entitlement of exclusive
concession rights to historical concession operators, i.e, GRDF and
22 local distribution companies (ELD), to exclusive service areas. As
holders of a “distribution monopoly,” they are the sole operators with
whom municipalities may renew the concession. The grounds for
terminating a concession contract early are strictly controlled (listed
exhaustively) as is the date the concession can be terminated (cannot be
in the first half of the contracted term). Termination also requires two.
years’ notice and the concession-granting authority must pay
compensation to the concession operator for early termination.

Apart from the exclusive service areas of GRDF and the local distribution
companies, the Energy Code allows all municipalities not supplied with
natural gas to entrust their public gas distribution to the authorized
operator of their choice.

In addition to the special case of public service delegations recently
acquired after a competitive bidding process, GRDF’s activity is
remunerated by a tariff set by the CRE. Following the CRE's decision of
March 10, 2016, the new GRDF natural gas distribution tariff, “ATRD5,”
entered into force on July 1, 2016 for a period of four years. It applies to
the GRDF exclusive service area. The structure of this tariff is consistent
with the previous tariff. The CRE took into account all major projects that
GRDF will take on during the period, allowing the company to continue
its industrial safety and development initiatives while at the same time
requiring it to increase its productivity.

This new tariff framework led to an increase of 2.76% effective July 1,
2016. The transmission rate remains stable, as the decrease in the rate
by -2.05% on July 1, 2017 was followed by an increase of 2.01% on
July 1, 2018. The rate hike on July 1, 2018 primarily covers the increase
in unpaid charges repaid to the gas suppliers and the expenses related
to the pilot phase of the gas changeover project (conversion from B gas
to H gas for the customers in northern France).

The year 2018 was also the year of the implementation of the CRE's
decisions on the remuneration of natural gas suppliers for the customer
management services they perform on behalf of the distributor.

The Energy Code assigns a joint service, primarily responsible for
construction, worksite project management, network operations and
maintenance, and metering operations. GRDF and Enedis (formerly
ERDF) are linked by an agreement defining their relationship within the
Joint Department, the services it provides, and the distribution of the
resulting costs. This agreement, signed for an indefinite period, may be

terminated at any time, subject to 18 months’ notice, during which
period the parties undertake to renegotiate this agreement.

1.3.7.3 Elengy
1.3.7.3.1 Role & Strategy

LNG terminals are port facilities that allow liquefied natural gas (LNG) to
be received and regasified. New services have been developed since
2012, such the reloading of LNG tankers, transshipment between
vessels, and LNG tank truck loading.

Elengy is the second-largest European LNG terminal operator (source:
GIIGNL), with three LNG terminals in France. The facilities operated by
Elengy had a total regasification capacity of 21.25 billion m® (Gm‘) of gas
per annum as of December 31, 2018.

Elengy’s strategy is defined around on the following key points:

= optimize operation methods for each of the three sites in order to get
best value from them regardless of their utilization rate;

= imagine and offer, in its terminals or other infrastructures, new storage
and transfer services for imported or renewable LNG, particularly with
a view to its use as an onshore or maritime fuel;

@ find growth opportunities internationally by highlighting the asset
management and operations expertise developed over the past
50 years.

In 2017, GRTgaz, ENGIE's independent subsidiary, acquired Elengy.

1.3.7.3.2 Description of activities

Fos Tonkin Terminal: Brought into service in 1972, Fos Tonkin is
located on the Mediterranean coast and receives LNG primarily from
Algeria. Its regasification capacity stands at 3 billion Gm® of gas per
year. Its jetty can accommodate vessels carrying up to 75,000 m? of
LNG and its tank has a total capacity of 80,000 m*.

= Montoir-de-Bretagne Terminal: Montoir-de-Bretagne, which was
brought into service in 1980, is located on the Atlantic coast and
receives LNG from various sources. It has a regasification capacity of
10 Gm*® of gas per year, two docks that can accept tankers
transporting up to 260,000 m* of LNG (Qmax) and three storage
tanks with a total capacity of 360,000 m® of LNG. The work
completed in 2017 allowed the start-up of a new, sustainable
transshipment activity.

Fos Cavaou Terminal: the Fos Cavaou terminal was brought into
commercial service in 2010. It has a regasification capacity of
8.25 billion Gm? of gas per year, a jetty that can accommodate
Qmax-size tankers, and three tanks with a total capacity of 330,000 m*
of LNG. The terminal is owned by a dedicated subsidiary, Fosmax
LNG, in which Elengy has a 72.5% stake and Total Gaz Electricité
Holding France SAS has a 27.5% stake. It is operated by Elengy.

= Access to LNG terminals (principles and tariffs): the LNG terminals
are accessible to all LNG suppliers. The tariffs for access to
regasification are regulated. The current tariffs were set by the CRE
ruling of January 18, 2017 and have been in force since April 1, 2017.

They are significantly lower than the previous tariffs: 6.5% for Montoir,
18.2% for Fos Tonkin, and 18.6% for Fos Cavaou. These decreases are
mainly due to the lower return on assets, reduced operating expenses,
and higher productivity, all of which benefit the LNG terminal users.

ENGIE 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 29

Presentation of the Group
1.3 Description of the Group's activities

The current tariffs apply to a basic service, i.e., the main offer of the LNG
terminal operators, which can be supplemented by subscription to an
option that guarantees uniform supply for 20 to 40 days.

The LNG tanker transshipment and loading services are not regulated.

1.3.7.4 Storengy
1.3.7.4.1 Role & Strategy

With Storengy and its subsidiaries, the Group is the leader in
underground gas storage in Europe, with net storage capacity of
12.2 billion m®. Against a backdrop of long-term adverse market
conditions and major shakeups in the energy sector, Storengy adapts to
handle the risks weighing on its core business and develop new
ambitions made possible by the energy transition.

Its strategy is to:

provide high-performance, innovative solutions to its customers by
optimizing its operations in its traditional markets and by promoting
regulatory frameworks adapted to the business of storage
infrastructure manager;

= be a driving force in the energy transition, leveraging its sites to best
serve its territories;

= develop business in growth markets: production and storage of
renewable gas, solutions designed to compensate for the intermittent
nature of the production of electrical renewables and geothermal
power, and by creating value for its core expertise (drilling,
geosciences, surface processes, risk management, etc.)

1.3.7.4.2 Description of activities

In France, as of December 31, 2018, the subsidiary Storengy SA was
operating in France:

= 14 underground storage facilities (13 of them wholly owned). Nine of
these storage facilities are in aquifers (total useful storage volume of
9 billion m’), four are in salt caverns (total useful storage volume of
1 billion m’), and one is in a depleted field (useful storage volume of
80 million m*); three of these sites are in reduced operation according

to precise regulatory procedures (corresponding to a total useful
volume of 880 million m*);

= 36 compressors with a total power of 186 MW, to withdraw and inject
natural gas;

= surface facilities to process the gas withdrawn, before injection into
the transmission network.

Underground storage facilities fall under the Mining Code and are operated
pursuant to a concession granted by the French government following a
public inquiry and competitive tenders. In light of the 2018 campaign, the
French regulatory system governing the storage business was completely
reformed. The system lays out the following major principles:

=the Multi-Year Energy Schedule defines the scope of the
infrastructures that are essential to the safety of supply in the region.
This scope is the regulated infrastructures;

= every year, a decree establishes the minimum subscription and fill
level for storage facilities;

= the French Energy Regulation Commission (CRE) defines the
authorized revenue of the storage operators;

= storage capacity are marketed via public auctions combined with a
compensation system to allow reaching the authorized revenue
defined by the CRE.

Following consultations initiated by the public authorities with the various
actors (storage operators, natural gas suppliers in France) the CRE, in its
resolution of February 22, 2018, set the parameters of the regulation.
These parameters have been applied since January 1, 2018.

In Germany, Storengy Deutschland GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Storengy, holds and operates six storage sites for a working capacity of
nearly 1.7 billion m® (three salt sites and three depleted sites).

In the United Kingdom, Storengy UK Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Storengy, is dedicated to the construction and marketing of storage
capacity in saline cavities at Stublach, in Cheshire. The planned storage
capacity at the site is 400 million m® of useful volume, divided into
20 cavities. Half of the capacity (10 cavities) was in operation and being
sold in 2017. In 2018, Storengy UK placed five new cavities under gas.

around risk management and access to the energy markets in
Europe, Asia Pacific and America;

= services to manage and create value for renewable assets:
development of market solutions to accelerate the energy transition,
decentralized production aggregator (wind/solar) and_ flexibility
services (DSM).

The entry into force of the Vigilance Act 2018 led the GEM BU to
analyze all its different supply chains and suppliers.

Since May 2018, the GEM BU has also fully adopted the new General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the new European Union legal
framework that governs the collection and processing of data.

1.3.9 Other

The “Other” reportable segment includes the activities of the Europe
Generation BU, which includes the Group's thermal power generation
activities in Europe, the Tractebel BU (engineering companies
specializing in the energy, hydropower, and infrastructure sectors), the
GTT BU (specializing in the design of cryogenic membrane confinement
systems for maritime transport and onshore and offshore storage of
LNG), the contribution of the Hydrogen BU, the “Entreprises et
Collectivités” activities of ENGIE SA, and the Group's holding and
corporate activities, which include the entities that centralize the Group’s
financing requirements, and the contribution of the equity associate
SUEZ.

On January 1, 2018, the French government introduced a new mode of
access to storage capacities via an auction process. This new
mechanism, which was introduced by the Act of December 30, 2017
ending hydrocarbon exploration and production, led to the regulation of
the natural gas storage activity in France, replacing the negotiated

access that prevailed until that date, and now allows all market players.
to subscribe to storage capacity at market value.

On May 18, 2018, the Council of State (Conseil a’Etat) ruled that the
regulated natural gas sale tariffs are incompatible with EU law, which
means the French government will have to progressively eliminate the
regulated natural gas tariffs and the regulated electricity tariffs for the
sites of large companies in order to make them compatible with the law
of the European Union.

On November 1, 2018, the merger of France's two balancing areas,
PEG Nord (northern Gas Exchange Point) and TRS (Trading Region
South), resulted in a single balancing region (Trading Region France) for
the French natural gas market, like the electricity market. This progress
in the implementation of the European electricity network codes is
intended to harmonize the operating rules of the forward, day-ahead,
intraday and balancing markets.

the electricity markets: stronger regional coordination, increased
availability of the trans-border transport capacity market, and increased
demand in the markets

The entry into force of the Vigilance Act in 2018 led the GEM BU to
analyze all its different supply chains and suppliers.

Since May 2018, the GEM BU has also fully adopted the new General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the new European Union legal
framework that governs the collection and processing of data.

On January 3, 2018, the entry into force of the new European Markets in
Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID ||) helped to increase transparency
and the protection of customers in terms of the financial products from
which they benefit.

1.3.9.1 Generation Europe 1.3.9.1.2 Description of activities

1.3.9.1.1 Role & Strategy

The market environment of BU Generation Europe is impacted by a
transition towards a less carbon intensive economy. This is
characterized by an ever-increasing share of renewable energy sources
(RES) combined with a stable or even decreasing demand for power,
which has led to over-capacity and an intensified competition on its
mature markets.

However, the rise of intermittent RES triggers more generation volatility
and thus both issues of security of supply for the industry and grid
stability for the Transmission System Operators (TSO). For that, natural
gas power plants play a key role in today's energy markets, by offering
the needed flexibility. To allow the power plants to remain operational
and, produce power at times of low power generation from renewable
energy sources, governments are also gradually adopting various
mechanisms which remunerate power generators to ensure back-up
capacity (Capacity Reserve Mechanism, strategic reserve...).

In this context, BU Generation Europe wants to play that role of perfect
complement to renewables and to help large industrial customers to
face the challenges of the energy transition. BU Generation Europe offer
power energy competitively on mature European commodity markets by
bringing to market the most economically priced energy, by :

= operating and developing selectively low CO, emitting gas generation
activities;

= developing battery storage, especially in combination with CCGTs,
and where possible extend pump-storage;

= offering solutions for large industrials, for the (new) challenges they
face in the energy transition;

= supporting the development of a sustainable value chain around
green hydrogen.

The BU has also continued to remodel its portfolio of activities, this
contributing to the ENGIE transformation plan.

BU Generation Europe is managing a portfolio of thermal generation
assets with an installed capacity of 20.3 GW in 8 European countries
(Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and
Greece). The installed capacity split by technology is the following: gas
(15.6 GW), coal (2.9 GW), hydropower and pump storage (1.3 GW),
biomass & others (0.5 GW).

Next to its power generation business, BU Generation Europe offers
services to large industrial customers around energy and O&M solutions,
to help them face the challenges in the energy transition, based on our
strengths, proximity and our strong references.

1.3.9.2 Tractebel

1.5 Innovation, research and technologies policy

1.5.1 Innovation

In order to be a leader of the energy transition in Europe, the Group
relies on innovation to meet its customers’ new requirements.

ENGIE Fab is the starting point for innovation, nurturing new business
from idea to implementation. ENGIE Fab is organized around three
segments: Innovation & Sourcing, ENGIE New Ventures, and ENGIE
New Business Factory.

The Innovation and Sourcing segment aims to position the Group at the
cutting edge of developments in mature energy markets and to
stimulate the convergence of energy services and _ information
technology. It fosters the development of new models for growth and
the exercise of the Group’s business lines. A number of tools and
processes have been deployed to foster entrepreneurial creativity and
ensure that innovation promotes the Group's long-term commercial
development. The innov@ENGIE collaborative platform, designed for
ENGIE employees, aims to foster innovation within the Group and
promote collaborative innovation among employees. On December 31,
2018, innov@ENGIE had over 22,500 members and nearly 800
innovation ideas had been proposed.

The platform builds on existing approaches, particularly the Innovation
Awards, an annual in-house competition that recognizes innovative
projects put forward by the Group's employees. The 2018 edition of the
Innovation Awards received 530 submissions from 36 countries.

To strengthen its links with the innovation ecosystem of its host regions,
the Group partners with major innovation-themed events. In 2018,
ENGIE participated in the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las

Vegas and in the Viva Technology trade show in Paris. In May 2018,
ENGIE’s “Innovation Week” saw the organization of around 130 events,
bringing together thousands of participants, including Group employees,
customers, startups and entrepreneurs from 25 countries.

Since 2014, ENGIE has launched more than 90 calls for projects aimed
at startups. More than 2,650 proposals were received in response to the
technological or commercial needs of the Group's operating entities.

The investment fund ENGIE New Ventures has been helping innovative
startups since 2014, in order to create opportunities for ENGIE. With
€166 million in funds, it aims to acquire (minority) stakes in startups
under development that have a connection to the Group’s activities,
offering them both financial and operational assistance. It also invests in
other funds (e.g. in the Paris Fonds Vert fund in 2018).

At December 31, 2018, the ENGIE New Ventures portfolio had 18 direct
investments. The most recent of these include investments in Unabiz
(Singapore - loT applications and objects), HomeBiogas (Israel — biogas
production from organic household waste), and Redaptive (USA -
energy efficiency).

ENGIE New Business Factory was created in mid-2018 with the aim of
incubating and accelerating new businesses every year, in order to
produce solutions with the potential to become major new income
streams for ENGIE (“scalutions”, or scalable solutions). Three initial ideas
have been identified and are under development: DERMS (energy
management systems), TEO (blockchain solution for the authentication
of renewable energy), and A2E (renewable cooking gas).

1.5.2 Research & Technologies

In a time of energy transition, research and technological development
activities lay the groundwork for the Group's future by strengthening its
ability to identify, evaluate and test new technologies and business
models to validate safe and efficient solutions that will be integrated into
the offerings of tomorrow. R&D also helps the continuous improvement
of operational performance.

These activities, which rely on partnerships with globally recognized
organizations (e.g., laboratories, universities, manufacturers and
startups), help to integrate the Group within a powerful R&D and
innovation ecosystem. This raises its profile in the industry and boosts its
growth in the markets.

In 2018, Group expenditures on
development amounted to €182 million.

Risk factors and control
2.1 Risk management process

The material risks to which the Group is exposed, based on its own
assessment, are described below. Other, less significant risks or risks
unknown to date could also affect the Group. If these risks were to

materialize, they could have a negative impact on the Group's
operations, financial position and earnings, image and outlook, and/or
on the ENGIE share price.

2.1 Risk management process

2.1.1 Enterprise risk management policy

The Group has adopted an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) policy,
the principles of which are consistent with professional standards
(including ISO 31000 and the Federation of European Risk Management
Associations). The policy sets out ENGIE's ambition to “manage its risks
in order to ensure its performance”.

The Group's Enterprise Risk Management Policy applies to the Group's
businesses and controlled entities, while observing the rules of
governance that apply to each entity.

This policy promotes risk-taking at a reasonable level from a legal
perspective, acceptable to generally held opinion and economically
viable. It stipulates that all managers are risk managers. Generally, the
Management Committees of the Group's entities are the main bodies
that determine the actions to be taken to manage risks, except when a
specific risk committee is created, such as for market risk.

To achieve this aim, the Group has appointed the Risk Management
Director as Chief Risk Officer. His objective is to ensure the effectiveness
of the risk management system. He coordinates the designated Chief
Risk Officers of each of the BUs and Corporate Functions. These Chief

Risk Officers assess the BU’s or Function's overall risk exposure and
ensure that risk mitigation plans are implemented

Risk analysis and coordination of action plans are performed in
collaboration with all the Group's functional lines.

Each year, the Group's ERM process begins with a risk review by the
Executive Committee. An ERM campaign is then launched across the
Group, setting out guidelines for risk management throughout the year.
It highlights priority risks, each of which is coordinated by an Executive
Committee member and will be monitored specifically by one of the
Board's standing committees (see Section 4.1.1.2.3 “Standing
committees"). It results in a new Group risk review that is presented to
the Executive Committee, then to the Audit Committee. After examining
the review, the Audit Committee gives its opinion on the effectiveness of
the risk management system to the Board of Directors.

Knowledge of risks resulting from feedback from operating entities and
functional departments is supplemented by interviews with directors, an
analysis of publications by external analysts and a review of major
events.

2.1.2 Crisis management

ENGIE may have to face crisis situations. The Group has defined a crisis
management policy, which sets out the general principles and the roles
of the various participants, and has set up a dedicated organization.

The Group is thus equipped with a warning, analysis and
decision-making system to manage crises at the relevant organizational
level.

The effectiveness of the system is regularly assessed by means of
internal controls and appropriate exercises.

2.1.3 Risk and insurance coverage

ENGIE's Insurance Department is responsible for preparing, establishing
and managing insurance programs in the areas of Group asset
protection (against property damage and loss of earnings), personal
protection, third-party claims (civil liability) and automobile insurance,
and for prevention.

For each of these areas:

the amounts insured depend on the financial risks resulting from
potential claim scenarios and coverage conditions offered by the market
(available capacities and tariff conditions);

financing is optimized: low or moderate hazard risks are covered by
self-insurance plans, through deductibles and retentions or through the
use of the Group's reinsurance company whose commitments on a
cumulative basis represent a maximum estimated loss of approximately
0.14% of the Group's 2018 revenues.

42

However, the Group could, in certain cases, be required to pay out
sizable compensation not covered by the current insurance program or
could incur very high costs that its insurance policies do not reimburse
or reimburse inadequately. Although the Group has excellent insurance
coverage, specifically with regard to civil liability and environmental risks,
it could be liable beyond the maximum insured amount or for events not
covered (primarily due to the common insurance exclusions).

2.1.3.1 — Civil liability

A civil liability program for corporate officers and managers covers the
representatives of ENGIE, its subsidiaries and Group representatives
within its equity holdings.

A general civil liability program (including for environmental damage) has
been taken out for all the entities for a total amount of €800 million. This
program predominantly provides first-euro coverage or coverage for

ENGIE 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT.


--- Page 38 ---

amounts in excess of the underlying coverage taken out by some
entities (usually up to USD 50 million).

2.1.3.2 Nuclear civil liability

As an operator of nuclear power plants in Doel and Tihange (Belgium),
Electrabel's civil liability is governed by the Paris and Brussels
Conventions, which aim to ensure that victims receive compensation
and to encourage solidarity among signatory countries, and by the
Belgian Law of July 22, 1985, (amended by the Laws of June 29, 2014
and December 7, 2016) and a Royal Decree dated December 2, 2018.

This liability falls exclusively on the operator of the facility where the
nuclear accident occurs. In return for this strictly objective liability, the
amount of the compensation is capped per accident and limited in time
to a period of 10 years. This period was increased to 30 years by the
amended Law of June 29, 2014, and reduced again to 10 years by the
Law of December 7, 2016. The signatory countries to the conventions
also created a mechanism that provides additional compensation
beyond the maximum amount.

The nuclear civil liability insurance program taken out by Electrabel
complies with the Belgian national law requiring the operator to provide
financial guarantees or to take out civil liability insurance up to
€1.2 billion. Insufficient capacity in the insurance markets, however,
resulted in a shortfall of up to €891 million. This only affected the liability
extended by the Law of June 29, 2014, and only for nuclear accidents.

Risk factors and control
2.2 Risks related to the external environment

that allegedly occurred between January 1, 2016, and December 24,
2016, when the Law of December 7, 2016 came into force.

2.1.3.3 Property damage

The Group's entities have property insurance covering the facilities that
they own, lease or manage on behalf of third parties, with the exception
of gas transmission and distribution network pipelines and heat
networks in France. The main programs provide cover based either on
replacement value or on contractual limits per loss event. In the latter
case, the limits are set on the basis of major scenarios estimated in
accordance with insurance market rules and available offers (cost and
capacity).

Insurance covering business interruption and additional operating costs
is taken out based on each risk analysis and in consideration of existing
assistance plans.

Construction projects are covered by “Erection All Risks” programs
taken out by the owner or operator, project manager or prime
contractor.

2.1.3.4 Employee protection programs

The operating entities develop programs covering employees against
the risk of accidents and for medical expenses, in accordance with
legislation in effect and pursuant to company agreements.

2.2 Risks related to the external environment

The Group is sensitive to the structural and economic risk factors that
affect the energy sector. These risks are all analyzed and assessed as
part of strategic planning processes that allow the Group to anticipate
certain changes in the external environment and prepare for them. The

Group's research and innovation policy also helps to deal with strategic
developments (see Section 1.5.1 “Innovation” and 1.5.2 “Research &
Technologies”).

2.2.1 Economic and competitive environment

The Group's activity is impacted by the level of energy demand and
commodity prices, as well as by far-reaching changes in the energy
sector (e.g. the decentralization and decarbonization of generation,
renewable energy, new technologies, digitization, new competitor
profiles, etc. (see Sections 1.1.4 and 1.1.7).

After several years in decline, European commodities prices have begun
to climb again. Their regular fluctuations have created uncertainty
regarding some of the Group's assets.

The weak growth in natural gas demand could result in overcapacity in
the gas infrastructure.

With regard to service-related activities, competition remains strong and
weighs on margins.

In its different businesses, the Group competes with players with
increasingly diverse profiles, both in terms of size- with major
international players and local emerging players— and sectors. The
decentralization of systems due to energy transition has lowered the
entry barriers to some activities (photovoltaic power, services), allowing
smaller players to compete with the Group.

The emergence of digital and smart energy technologies has impacted
the gas and electricity value chain, as well as services in general, with
new competitors from the information technology and equipment
manufacturer sectors. More generally, competition is intensifying on
energy markets, with key players (oil companies, etc.) becoming more
and more active throughout the entire value chain.

Risk factors and control
2.2 Risks related to the external environment

In response to these uncertainties and changes:

= In the short term, the Group is rationalizing its generation fleet,
managing market risk (see Section 2.5.1 “Commodities market risk”),
adapting its asset portfolio and keeping an active watch on the
changes taking shape; the Group has also started to significantly
reduce its merchant exposure;

= In the medium term, the Group is getting ready to offer a new energy
market model and is campaigning for a higher CO, price on the
European market. It is also taking action in Europe and France to
propose a change to the gas market through the development of
biogas and, in Belgium, to create the conditions required to operate
nuclear power plants under favorable economic conditions. It is also
transforming its business model (see Sections 1.1.4 and 1.1.5).

2.2.2 Regulatory and political environment

The legal and regulatory landscape for the Group's businesses is
changing, both in terms of environmental and social issues and energy
sector regulation.

2.2.2.1. Environmental and social legislation

The Group's businesses are subject to a host of laws and regulations
that address environmental protection issues, promote energy systems
with zero or low greenhouse gas emissions, reduce energy
consumption, protect health and the biosphere, and impose safety
standards. The legislative bills and regulatory texts mentioned below, or
others yet to come, could impact the Group's strategy and results:

Internationally:

Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the world’s first universal
climate change agreement, at the COP21 in December 2015, the
COP22, COP23 and COP24 began to draw up the road map for the
signatory States. Although much work remains to be done to finalize the
arrangements to implement the agreement by 2020, the 1.5°C report
produced by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)
demonstrates that there can no longer be any doubt as to the need to
accelerate national CO, emissions policies. The Group is actively
preparing for this.

In Europe:

= Europe's 2030 climate and energy policy (the “Energy Union")
promotes energy efficiency, CO, emission reductions, and an
increase in the percentage of renewable energies in the energy mix;

= Changes in European and national regulations on CO, allowances
and prices have affected the CO, market in Europe and have
consequences for the relative competitiveness of natural gas and coal
power generation. On the European front, the 2018 agreement on the
post-2020 reform of the EU Emissions Trading System resulted in
higher CO, prices, which remain volatile;

In France:

= As part of the French law on the energy transition for green growth,
the Programmation Pluriannuelle de |’Energie (PPE, or Multi-Year
Energy Program), published in October 2016, reaffirmed its two
priorities of decreasing the CO, footprint and developing renewable
energy sources. The Group continues to pay close attention to
measures aimed at achieving these objectives, particularly support
mechanisms for renewable energy, competitive tendering for
hydropower concessions, and measures to combat fuel poverty. The
SNBC (Stratégie Nationale Bas-Carbone or National Low-Carbon
Strategy) and its implementation in the form of a PPE is expected to
be updated by the public authorities in 2019. Decisions made
regarding the energy mix could materially influence market share in
natural gas;

= The fourth obligation period under France's energy saving certificates
scheme (Certificats d'Economie d’Energie or CEE), which runs from
January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020, will significantly increase
ENGIE’s obligations compared to the previous period. The scarcity of
CEEs, lower flat rates and more stringent requirements resulted in an
increase in CEE prices in 2018. This is expected to continue and
could impact the Group's margins;

= The future thermal regulation, depending on how it addresses the CO,
footprint of new buildings, could give a boost to electric heating, to
the detriment of gas;

= The law on restoring biodiversity, nature and landscapes in France
has introduced the principle of “Avoid, Reduce, Offset” to the
environmental code. This principle has also been applied to the
regulations of other countries. It also introduces the principle of
environmental prejudice. The biodiversity plan, published on July 4,
2018, has supported the implementation of this law and accelerated
the implementation of the National Biodiversity Strategy (2020
objective). These laws have tightened environmental constraints on
projects in France but are effectively a driver of innovation for the
implementation of solutions that preserve nature.

The increasing implementation of “soft law” across the world requires
the Group to analyze its activities through an additional lens, and to
better incorporate the input and expectations of stakeholders.

The Group is shifting its strategy and rationalizing its generation fleet and
its project portfolio so that it can take advantage of opportunities, and is
working to limit all of these risks, principally as part of a proactive
environmental and social policy (see Section 3.5 “Environmental
information”). In 2015, the Group decided not to launch any new
developments in coal. In January 2018, it sold its stake in the Loy Yang
B coal-fired power plant in Australia, and is in the process of selling its
stake in Glow in Thailand and the coal assets it owns in Germany and
the Netherlands, thus reducing risks related to coal activities.

2.2.2.2 Sector regulations

In Europe and in some other regions including the United States, Asia
Pacific, Mexico and Brazil, public authorities intervene in the energy
sector through regulation and the extension of regulatory powers in the
area of competition. These measures can take the form of increased
taxation on energy company profits, the withdrawal of funds established
for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants, changes to the rules
governing the markets and the security of supply, interventions by
regulators in the deregulated sector to encourage the development of
competition, and the move towards the remunicipalization of certain
utilities.

Some regulatory changes may alter the risk profile of the Group and
impact its earnings and its business model:

In Europe:

= The Juncker Commission launched the Clean Energy Package, a
wide-ranging series of laws implementing its “Energy Union” project,
as well as the Clean Mobility Package for sustainable mobility. Some
developments are positive, because they introduce greater visibility,
such as the formalization of an energy and climate framework for
2030 based on targets for the development of renewables and energy
efficiency, a stronger carbon market, and the redesign of the
electricity market model (see below, Section 2.2.2.1). Others could
have more negative effects on the Group's businesses, for example
the trend towards electrification, particularly in building and transport.
In the final phase of negotiations on the architecture of the new
electricity market, the Group is paying particular attention to the
framework that will enable coordinated development of national
capacity markets in a legally secure environment, to the future rules
on ownership of electricity storage assets, and to the impact of future
European standards on changes in regulated electricity tariffs. It is
also focused on ensuring that gas solutions (LNG, NGV and
hydrogen) are included in the range of alternative fuels promoted by
the Clean Mobility Package;

= The implementation of common rules for the European internal
electricity and gas markets (including the electricity and gas network
codes) is intended to complete the creation of a real internal energy
market. These changes, which are necessary but will not be enough
to adapt the market to the energy transition, could facilitate the
emergence of price signals enabling the various sources of flexibility
(production, demand, storage) to be valued in the market;

= The guidelines for state aids for energy and the environment,
published in 2014, have impacted the Group's activities, in particular
support mechanisms for renewable energy sources (to gradually
integrate them into the market) and energy efficiency, infrastructure
financing, environmental tax exemptions and exemptions from the
costs linked to the financing of renewables (preferential rates for
manufacturers) and capacity payment mechanisms.

In France:

= A portion of the Group's sales are made in the context of regulated
tariffs. French laws and rules and European regulations, and decisions
by regulators (in particular, the French Energy Regulation Commission
(CRE) with regard to decisions on tariffs for access to certain
infrastructures) may affect the Group's revenue, profits or profitability,
in the event of the partial pass-through of supply, infrastructure and
commercial costs to natural gas selling prices or the partial

Risk factors and control
2.2 Risks related to the external environment

pass-through of costs from gas infrastructure access tariffs or the
sales of electricity generated from renewable energy.

= The regulation of underground natural gas storage facilities that came
into force on January 1, 2018, has ensured greater stability in the
associated revenues. However, the scope of the regulated assets has
yet to be defined as part of the annual revision of the PPE.

= The opening up of the electricity market to suppliers other than the
traditional operator, aside from the opening obtained for very large
customers, is still limited and could be jeopardized by the emergence
of price cuts arising from regulated tariffs that remain and compete
with commercial offerings.

= The decision by the French Council of State (Conseil d’Etat) on
July 19, 2017, which paves the way for the removal of regulated tariffs
for gas sale to individuals without removing as well the regulated
tariffs for electricity sale , may negatively affect the Group's market
share in France. The decision by the French Council of State on May
18, 2018, heralds the end of regulated tariffs for electricity sale to
some professional customers. The government has undertaken to
legislate on gas and electricity tariffs via the PACTE law, which was.
submitted to the National Assembly in October 2018 and is
scheduled for submission to the Senate in early 2019.

In Belgium:

= The government has been working on drawing up an “energy pact”
with the aim of defining the key strategic objectives of the future
energy and sustainable development policy adopted at the end of
March 2018. It still aims to do away with nuclear power by 2025, as
long as certain criteria are met: security of supply, climate change
targets, competitive prices for manufacturers and nuclear safety. A
monitoring committee will be set up to assess compliance with these
criteria. Following the pact, the Group could be subject in the medium
term to new regulations, such as those defining the power generation
mix to be achieved by 2050, and/or new obligations imposed on gas
and electricity suppliers in order to achieve the goals of the energy
pact. The pact will also provide opportunities for the Group,
particularly in the services area.

= The bill on the implementation of a capacity remuneration mechanism
(CRM), which objective is to ensure security of supply, i.e. sufficient
power production capacity to allow for the phase-out of nuclear
power by 2025, is expected to be put to a vote before the next
federal elections in May 2019.

= The decision to extend the operating life of the nuclear power unit
Tihange 1 to 50 years took effect on October 1, 2015, with a program
of associated works that will continue until early 2020 (see Notes 10
and 14 of Section 6.2.2 “Notes to consolidated financial statements’).
The Belgian government's decision to extend the date of shutdown of
the Doel 1 and 2 nuclear power units after 50 years, which was
confirmed by parliamentary vote at the end of June 2015, was
approved by the Belgian Federal Agency for Nuclear Control (FANC)
as part of its fourth ten-year review, on the basis of a committed
modernization program that will be in place early 2020. Legal
proceedings brought by environmental organizations before the
Constitutional Court against the Belgian state regarding the lack of
any environmental impact analysis or public consultation in
connection with the adoption of the law passed in June 2015 are still
ongoing, and there is a risk that this law may be annulled (See Note
28 of Section 6.2.2 “Notes to consolidated financial statements”).

ENGIE 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 45

Risk factors and control
2.2 Risks related to the external environment

= Compliance with the seismic standards recommended by the
European Nuclear Security Regulators Association could be
transposed into Belgian law and lead to additional investment, hurting
Electrabel's bottom line.

= The operation of nuclear power plants is regulated in part by
radioactive waste authorizations. The Group therefore reduces its
radioactive liquid and gaseous effluent waste as much as possible,
while controlling the volume of low and medium level radioactive
waste. In Belgium, all nuclear waste management is the responsibility
of ONDRAF, the Belgian National Agency for Radioactive Waste and
Enriched Fissile Material. ONDRAF proposes, as a national policy, that
high level radioactive waste and/or long-lived waste be stored in deep
geological repositories and not in long-term storage facilities. This
proposal has yet to be approved by the Belgian government.

= Spent nuclear fuel is currently stored at generation sites. At present
there are two possible scenarios for its management: either a portion
of spent fuel is reprocessed and the rest is discharged directly into
deep geological repositories; or all of the spent fuel is discharged into
deep geological repositories. It is up to Synatom to propose a solution
that is likely to be approved by the Belgian government.

= Costs associated with the management of spent fuel and the
dismantling of plant and equipment are included in the costs of
nuclear power production and are the subject of provisions. The
assumptions and sensitivities regarding the assessment of these
amounts are detailed in Note 20.2 of Section6.2.2 “Notes to
Consolidated financial statements”.

In the rest of the world:

= Price control mechanisms also exist in countries other than France,
specifically Belgium, Italy, Romania, Brazil and Mexico, for energy
generation, distribution and sales, which may potentially impact the
Group's results.

= In Brazil, the Group is exposed to changes in the regulation of
electricity markets, such as subsidy reductions;

= Changes in energy market regulations in the United States could
impact the Group's activities and development in this region;

= In Mexico and the Asia-Pacific region, deregulation of the energy
markets or tariff changes could jeopardize the maintenance or
renewal of certain power sales agreements or affect their profitability,
leading to greater uncertainty over results.

Through its presence in the EU and Member State institutions, the
Group tries to anticipate any legislation likely to affect it, and formulates
proposals for decision-makers. The Group also partially diversifies
regulatory and legislative risks by conducting its business in a number of
different countries. However, some regulatory developments offer new
opportunities for the Group's activities.

2.2.2.3. Social responsibility

In order to carry out its activities, the Group must hold various permits
and authorizations. Dealing with the regulatory authorities concerned to
obtain or renew these can involve long and costly procedures. The
Group may face opposition from the local population or associations
during the installation or operation of certain equipment, or in relation to
protests against energy prices.

The Group therefore carries out broad consultation processes prior to
the start of its projects, forges partnerships with civil society and ensures
that its activities have a positive economic impact, in line with
community expectations (see Section 3.6 “Societal information”).

France's law of March 27, 2017 on the duty of vigilance of parent and
ordering companies extends the scope of the Group's legal
responsibilities and thus the list of potential areas that could be subject
to non-compliance, which could impact the Group's reputation (see
Section 4.3 “Vigilance plan”).

2.2.2.4 Country risk

The Group is present, operates or procures natural gas and a variety of
industrial components in a large number of countries. The Group is,
therefore, exposed to a variety of risks, including changes in regulation,
sovereign default, convertibility, expropriation, corruption, acts of war or
terrorism, and the extra-territorial effects of some legislation. Moreover,
in the event of a dispute with national governments or other local public
entities, the Group might be unable to defend its rights in certain
countries due to a lack of independence of local courts.

The diversity of the Group’s locations mitigates country risk to some
extent. Attention thresholds by country or group of countries enable the
Group's exposure to be monitored. The Group also manages these
risks within partnerships or contractual negotiations adapted to each
location. It chooses its locations by applying a formal investment
procedure that appraises risk. The inclusion of international arbitration
clauses in major contracts is applied as widely as possible.

The Group's decentralized organization means that the Business Units
are responsible for their own income statements and investments. Each
Business Unit is overseen by a Group Executive Vice President who is a
member of the Executive Committee. This organization enables the
Group to closely manage political and regulatory changes in each
country in which it operates, while ensuring that country risk is taken into
account at the appropriate level.

= In the United States, the CAATSA (Countering America’s Adversaries
Through Sanctions Act) of August 2, 2017 allows (on a discretionary
basis) the US President to impose secondary sanctions on any entity
that participates, in particular through investment, in the construction
and/or maintenance of Russian gas export pipelines (Section 2.3.2).
On October 31, 2017, the State Department published public
guidance on the way in which it intends to implement the Act in
practice. In this guidance, the State Department indicated that
projects that had been initiated before August 2, 2017 would not be
subject to potential sanctions under this Section 2.3.2. It is specified
that “projects initiated before August 2 2017" must be understood as
any project contracted before said date, which is the case for project
Nord Stream Il. On these grounds, ENGIE's contractual financing
commitments, signed before August 2 2017, have been fulfilled.
However, if the Nord Stream II project were to become subject to
sanctions, these could impact the project contractors (but alternative
solutions exist), ENGIE's future investments (to which a “drawstop"
would then be applied, like other European companies, in order to
avoid sanctions, and Gazprom would have to continue to fund the
project alone) or investments already made, obliging ENGIE to
withdraw from its financing agreements. This last scenario seems
unlikely. The Group is mobilizing all its resources to reduce this risk.

= In Europe, an orderly Brexit is expected to have a limited impact on
the Group's activities. Uncertainties about the ability of the UK
government and the European authorities to reach a political
agreement and the possibility of a “no-deal" Brexit are being
monitored in order to identify the legal issues that could affect the
Group's activities in the United Kingdom and those of entities with
links to the UK BU. The consequences of a “no deal” Brexit on gas
and electricity trading, the functioning of the European carbon market,
the continuity of contracts and the HR process, in particular, will have

2.2.3. Impact of climate

Information presented in this section and in Section 3.5.4.1 “Climate
change" reflects the financial risks associated with the effects of climate
change and the measures taken by the company to mitigate them by
implementing a low carbon strategy in all the components of its activity.

In the short term, climate phenomena (e.g., temperature variation,
flooding, wind, drought) affect energy generation and demand. They
have a direct effect on the Group's results.

To adapt its offering to fluctuations in annual demand, ENGIE optimizes
its portfolio of assets, its gas resources (by modulating its supplies and
managing its underground storage), and its power generation fleet.

In the longer term, climate change could have a bigger impact on the
Group's activities, for example through changes in regional or seasonal
energy demand, the obligation to reduce CO, equivalent emissions,
conflicts over water use, and the preservation of natural carbon sinks,
etc.

To manage this risk, ENGIE acts on different levels:

= the Group is firmly committed to combating climate change by
investing in low-carbon technologies, reducing its greenhouse gas
emissions and adapting its operations accordingly. The Group

agreement is reached or not between the UK and the European
Union

The UK's withdrawal from the Euratom treaty is not likely to have a
significant effect on ENGIE, as the Group has withdrawn from the
NuGen project, Group subsidiaries with activities in the UK nuclear
sector are based in the UK with UK staff, and measures have already
been taken by Synatom in relation to nuclear fuel.

promotes international carbon pricing in order to accelerate the
transition to a low-carbon society, while guaranteeing a level playing
field for all players;

= the Group has set 2020 targets for greenhouse gas emissions and
renewable energy (see Section 3.5 “Environmental information") The
expansion of its renewable energy fleet and the development of
service offerings are the main drivers of ENGIE’s energy transition
strategy. For the longer term, ENGIE made the decision at the end of
2017 to pursue a trajectory compatible with the goal of limiting the
global temperature increase to 2°C, by reducing its direct emissions
by 85% by 2050 and developing the substitution of natural gas by
renewable gas;

= The Group is gradually developing adaptation plans to prepare for an
increase in extreme weather events (see Section 3.5 “Environmental
information");

Since anticipating the implementation of Article 173 of the French
Energy Transition Law regarding greater transparency on climate
risks, the Group has followed the work of the TCFD (Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures) and is now reviewing the
implementation of its recommendations.

2.2.4 Reputational risk

The energy sector is the subject of various public debates due to the
profound changes that it is undergoing.

The Group is exposed to reputational risk, both directly and indirectly,
especially when the Group’s values, ethics, operational excellence or
legitimacy as an operator are called into question.

As a vital part of the Group's intangible corporate assets, the “ENGIE”
brand (registered in more than 100 countries) is constantly monitored to
protect it against any fraudulent use that could harm the Group's image.

Through its policies, organization, procedures and governance, the
Group endeavors to prevent operational risks (see Sections 2.3

“Operational risks" and Section 2.4 “Industrial risks") and smear
campaigns that could affect its reputation.

The Group relies on an external monitoring agency to record disputes,
including those on social networks, where its name is mentioned, in
order to identify and deal with any problems at source.

The Group takes its environmental and societal responsibilities seriously;
It decided to close the Hazelwood coal-fired power plant in Australia at
the end of March 2017 and manages its nuclear activities without
compromise in terms of safety.

Risk factors and control
2.3 Operational risks

2.3 Operational risks

2.3.1 Purchases and sales

2.3.1.1 Purchase and sale of natural gas

The Group has established a procurement portfolio composed, in part,
of long-term contracts, including some with a take-or-pay clause which,
under certain conditions, stipulates that minimum quantities will be taken
during a period.

In case of major gas supply interruption (for example, due to the
interruption of Russian deliveries or an interruption to transit in Ukraine)
or difficulty in renewing certain contracts under favorable economic:
conditions, the replacement cost for gas, including transportation, could
be higher and affect the Group's margins. To mitigate this risk, the
Group has a number of tools for flexibility and modulation (flexibility in
long-term contracts, storage and regasification capacity, and
purchasing in the marketplaces) as well as a diversified portfolio.

Prices of long-term purchase contracts may be decorrelated from selling
prices or prices in the gas markets (mainly due to transmission costs).
This spread might have a significant impact on the Group's results.
Long-term contracts include price adjustment clauses, so that the
economic balance between producer and buyer can be adjusted. The
Group's buy/sell margin may therefore change according to price
adjustments in gas contracts and the state of the gas market in general.

Negotiations in recent years have led to the integration of market indices
in long-term contracts and/or to the reduction of the difference between
contract prices and market prices. They have also led to increased
frequency of price revisions.

2.3.1.2 Purchase and sale of electricity

The Group is an electricity producer with a major presence in Europe
and Brazil, where the profitability of its assets is linked mainly to prices in
electricity markets. The economic climate or decisions by some states
regarding the electricity sector may lead to volatility in electricity prices,
which may have an impact on Group earnings.

The Group may also have to buy power to supply its customers, for
example to cover any temporary non-availability of its facilities. These
purchases are optimized but could generate extra supply costs.

The Group monitors changes in its risk exposure and makes decisions
accordingly (see Section 2.5.1 “Commodities market risk”).

2.3.1.3. Operational risks related
to the purchase and sale of energy

In its portfolio optimization activities for physical assets (power plants),
long-term contracts and customers, as well as in managing the
associated financial positions, the Group is exposed to operational risks
such as fraud, execution error, and process and system failure. If they
were to materialize, these risks would likely result in both economic and
reputational consequences for the Company. Operations are monitored

via appropriate processes, and risks are taken into account as part of
the Group's internal control program, known as “INCOME”. In addition,
a specific system for increased monitoring of operational risks has been
set up in some of the Group's entities, with the aim of recording
incidents, analyzing their primary causes and establishing appropriate
mitigation plans.

2.3.1.4 Purchase risks and supply chain risks
(excluding energy)

The main task of ENGIE's Purchasing function is to offer operational
managers a panel of competitive, distinctive suppliers and to negotiate
with them and monitor contracts. This relationship with suppliers
enables ENGIE's business to be developed while maintaining
compliance with the Group's commitments and managing the risks of
the entire supply chain.

The management of purchasing risk replicates the structure of the
purchasing function:

= Risks relating to the Group's key suppliers (called “preferential”
suppliers) are managed cross-functionally in the Group's Strategic
Sourcing & Supply Department by the Category Manager in charge of
his or her category. He or she carries out a full analysis of all the
different supply chain risks (technical, industrial, financial, ethical,
health and safety, environmental, human rights, etc.). Suppliers are
classified and selected according to their exposure to these risks
weighted for country risk. Contracts with these suppliers include
specific clauses according to the risk criteria encountered, which may
result in penalty systems in the event of non-fulfillment. Lastly, the
performance delivered by suppliers is measured periodically as part of
business reviews, and the associated improvement plans are
reviewed by the Category Manager.

= Risks related to the major suppliers of each BU are managed by the
Chief Procurement Officers (CPOs) of each BU, who adapt their
mitigation plans according to the specific requirements of their BU
(activities, local legislation, etc.). This management of the BU’s
purchasing risk is incorporated into its ERM system.

= More generally, the Purchasing chain's main risks, which are
managed at the Group level, are:
= Operational or contractual breaches by our suppliers,
= The loss of sensitive Group data entrusted to our suppliers,
= Failure to comply with the commitments of a socially
responsible company (SRC), particularly in the areas of health

and safety, human rights and the environment (all of which are
part of the duty of vigilance prevention plan),

= Late payment by ENGIE of supplier invoices.

Lastly, in industrial projects, risk management covers the purchasing
chain, suppliers and subcontractors.

2.3.2 Management of assets and development

2.3.2.1. Optimization of the asset

and investment portfolio

For the purposes of external expansion, especially by means of
acquisitions, the Group may issue equity securities or have recourse to
borrowing. Acquisitions present risks related to integration difficulties
and failure to achieve expected benefits and synergies. Risks related to
the valuation of assets or liabilities or non-achievement of expected
results could arise at the end of the acquisition process, resulting in
provisions for asset impairment. The Group also sells assets for which it
may be obliged to provide certain liability guarantees (see Note 17.1.5 to
the financial parent company statements).

The processes implemented by the Group for analyzing, auditing
(especially during due diligence) and structuring risks during a planned
acquisition are designed to provide a more accurate assessment of the
uncertainties that arise in such cases and to propose mechanisms to
protect against the risks identified. The resulting risk allocation depends.
‘on the quality of the information transmitted to the Group and is limited
by the legal and regulatory framework applicable under local corporate
law, and the outcome of the negotiation process.

With regard to integration, the Group has set up a dedicated team to
develop a suitable methodology and to support BUs through the
process.

2.3.2.2 Risks related to development
and major projects

The Group bases its growth on various industrial construction projects,
such as gas or electricity infrastructure for production or transportation,
of which it is the owner. These projects include some major projects,
such as thermal power plants (Fadhili in Saudi Arabia, Safi in Morocco,
Pampa Sul in Brazil, IEM Red Dragon in Chile), off-shore wind farms
(Tréport and Noirmoutiers in France, Moray in the United Kingdom) and
gas infrastructures (Stublach gas storage in the United Kingdom, in
particular) and a majority of medium-to-small projects (renewable energy
[KATHU solar park in Africa and wind projects, particularly in Brazil and
Egypt] and local heating or cooling networks). The profitability of these
assets depends greatly on cost control and construction deadlines, the
operational performance of the industrial asset, external phenomena
(e.g. natural disasters and strike actions), regulatory and fiscal changes.
and changes in the competitive environment and energy markets over
the medium and long term, which could reduce the profitability of certain
assets and result in lost revenues or asset impairment.

The Group is also responsible for the facility design and construction
phases of some projects. Although these projects are always subject to
in-depth studies and the Group has acknowledged expertise,
construction deadlines may not always be met, resulting in penalties,
construction costs may be higher than anticipated, the facilities’
performance may not comply with the specifications or subsequent
accidents may trigger the Group's civil, professional or criminal liability.
This could have a negative impact on the Group's image, financial
position, or earnings.

The Group has strengthened the operational monitoring and oversight of
projects and has put in place a program to monitor the portfolio of
large-scale projects at Group level, in order to provide the warnings
needed to launch corrective actions. A policy governing supervision of
project construction and joint project management methods have
reinforced existing mechanisms within the entities executing industrial
projects. In addition, training focused on project risk management has.
been developed for all project managers and developers.

Furthermore, the implementation of contract management measures
enables part of these risks to be mitigated, including by compensation
mechanisms. Insurance underwriting allows for insured losses to be
indemnified and also improves prevention.

2.3.2.3. Risks relating to partnerships and
minority investments

Partnerships and acquisitions of equity stakes are one of the ways in
which the Group can share the economic and financial risks inherent to
some projects, by limiting its capital employed and allowing it to adapt
more appropriately to the specific context of local markets (see Note 4
to Section 6.2.2 “Notes to consolidated financial statements"). The
Group strives as much as possible to protect its interests as a partner,
including through the signing of shareholders' agreements, possible
representation in governance (board of directors, management
positions) and reporting.

However, changes to the project, the economic situation, the partner's
or the Group's strategy, and even the local political environment may, in
some cases, lead to changes in the control or governance of a
partnership or to disinvestment.

To address these situations, the Group may establish contractual
provisions to resolve impasses within partnerships (deadlock
resolutions), exit clauses and, in the event of disputes with the partner(s),
litigation resolution clauses.

2.3.3 Legal risks

The Group manages its activities carefully, including their legal aspects.
In order to limit the legal risks inherent in any commercial activity, the
Group monitors the legal and regulatory framework, its operating
activities, partnerships, acquisitions and contracts concluded with third
parties, in particular through the presence of legal departments, both at
the parent company level and in each BU.

(1) This term refers to investigations or audits underway

However, the Group may find itself having to deal with disputes,
investigations and/or legal proceedings. The most significant of these
are described in Note 28 of Section 6.2.2 “Notes to consolidated
financial statements”. To the Company's knowledge, no other
administrative, legal or arbitration proceedings (including proceedings
that have been postponed or threatened") exists that is likely to have, or
has had, material impact on the financial position or profitability of the
Group in the past 12 months.

2.3.4 Ethical risks

The main risks identified are: corruption, violations of human rights, non
compliance to competition and/or embargo rules, fraud and breaches of
personal data. Any breach of the ethical principles of the Group could
constitute a legal and reputational risk (see Note 28 of Section 6.2.2
“Notes to consolidated financial statements").

In order to prevent as far as possible these risks from materializing,
ethical compliance policies and procedures are deployed throughout the
entire Group and they are applicable in all our controlled entities. The
Ethics, Compliance and Privacy Department promotes _ their
implementation within the Group, relying on the management line and
the Ethics & Compliance Officers and Data Protection Managers
networks. Those policies and procedures are instrumental in the

2.3.5 Risks related to human resources

In the context of its ambitious transformation plan (new businesses,
digitization, etc.) the Group could encounter difficulties in ensuring that it
has the right skills to support its development and to unite employees
around its business plan.

The skill risk relates as much to quality (adaptation of skills to new
activities) as to skills volumes (shortage in the labor market).

The transformation plan could also undermine employee engagement,
resulting in individual or collective attitudes that are not aligned with the
behaviors required for the transformation or to at-risk situations
regarding occupational well-being.

2.3.5.1 Workforce competencies

Developing the employability of its workforce is one of the Group's main
HR priorities.

Pursuing the commitments made in the European Social Agreement,
which it signed on April 8, 2016, ENGIE is providing HR support for the
transformation in three key ways: anticipating the skills needed and
managing changes in the Group's jobs (ENGIE Skills prospective
approach), stimulating the internal labor market (ENGIE Mobility) and
training (ENGIE Schools, in particular) (see Section 3.4.1 “Human
resources development and mobility policies”).

compliance to new Sapin II laws and Duty of Vigilance as well as to the
European Regulation n°2016/679 on the protection of personal data.

Ethical risks are analyzed annually and action plans are implemented if
necessary. Moreover, risks relating to corruption and human rights are
specifically assessed as part of the Group's risk analysis process (see
Section 4.2 “Ethics, Compliance and Privacy”)

In addition, the policy on the analysis of ethical risks relating to
investment projects and major contracts and the human rights
guidelines applicable to the whole Group require the entities to analyze
corruption risks and human rights risks for every new project.

2.3.5.2 Employee commitment

Given the scale and speed of the Group's transformation, it needs to
support managers and employees to give meaning to the changes and
promote buy-in.

In October 2018, for the third consecutive year, the Group carried out its
“ENGIE & Me” engagement survey to measure employee buy-in and
adapt its action plan.

Via its “ENGIE Leadership Way” program, ENGIE promotes managerial
behavior that fosters innovation and employee development (see
Section 3.4.1.4 “Targeted development policies"). In addition, the Group.
provides a “co-leader” training program for its 30,000 managers. ENGIE
is also particularly attentive to the prevention of psychosocial risks.

By communicating regularly about innovation, new business models,
and other topics related to the transformation, the Group aims to
strengthen internal support and encourage dialogue with employees.

2.3.5.3. Occupational well-being

The steps taken since 2016 to adapt the Corporate headquarters’
organization, to push forward ways of working and more generally to
anchor the Group's transformation are accompanied by different
measures aiming at preventing, detecting and remedying at-risk
situations, regarding occupational well-being, inherent to this type of
transformation.

2.3.6 Risks related to health and safety and protection of Group assets

2.3.6.1 Health and safety at work

The Group is committed to eradicating fatal accidents and reducing
workplace accidents and occupational illnesses. The Group health and
safety policy was agreed with the union federations at European level
and subsequently worldwide. An action plan was defined for the period
2016-2020, which was strengthened in 2017 with a specific action
program called “No Life at Risk", the aim of which is to develop the
safety culture and the commitment and vigilance of all individuals in
order to protect their lives and those of others, involving everybody
working on behalf of the Group. (see Section 3.4.6 “Health and safety
policy”). In 2018, the focus was put on the health and safety of
subcontractors.

2.3.6.2 Employee safety

The international scope of the Group means that some employees and
other parties such as subcontractors may be exposed to health and
safety risks, the threat of which warrants a specific organization
incorporating a “country watch". Wherever it operates, the Group
continually assesses the risks related to terrorism, armed conflict,
political or social unrest, organized or ordinary crime and, more
generally, the occurrence of “unconventional” situations.

Geographic areas are subject to classification, which correspond to
specific prevention and protection measures. To accomplish this
mission, the Group relies on State services as well as specialized
providers. If a specific situation occurs, the crisis management system
may be triggered, in order to deploy the necessary assistance measures.
to ensure the safety of all people concerned.

2.3.6.3. Protection of tangible and intangible
corporate assets

tangible assets, may be exposed to malicious acts. Information, whether
digital, physical or even communicated verbally, constitutes the Group’s.
intangible assets and may also be exposed to malicious acts.

Risk factors and control
2.3 Operational risks

To fight against this type of risk, the Group implements a policy for the
protection of tangible and intangible assets, covering technical (including
IT), legal, managerial and organizational areas. Sensitive sites where
tangible corporate assets are located are subject to protective measures.
tailored to the local situation and revised according to the current threat
status.

The Group continually acts to protect its intangible assets in order to
deal with any reported incidents and to prevent any internal or external
action aimed at capturing and using sensitive information. An
Information Security Committee brings together members from all the
relevant functional departments under the authority of the Executive
Vice-President in charge of Digital and Information Systems to
coordinate and manage the Group's security policies. It reports to the
Executive Committee.

2.3.7 Risks related to information systems

The Group is continually exposed to new threats from the introduction of
new technologies, particularly the multiplication of connected objects,
the development of industrial control systems, the spread of mobility
tools, and the development of new uses (e.g. social networking). Cyber
attacks target both the company and its customers and partners. More
generally, IT system failure could result in information losses or leaks,
delays and/or extra costs that could be detrimental to the Group’s
activities or its reputation.

In response, the Group continually adjusts its prevention, detection and
protection measures for all of its information systems and critical data.
The Group therefore has a Global Security Operation Center (GSOC) in
place that is operated worldwide with the assistance of Thales,
strengthened controls for access to its cloud platforms, data encryption

devices and cyber-insurance cover. To comply with the new regulations
(European Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of personal data,
European Directive 2016/1148 on the security of networks and
information systems), assessments are organized for the sites or
applications concerned (Data Privacy Impact Assessments) and some
Group entities have taken steps to obtain ISO 27001 certification of the
security of their information systems. Large-scale attacks are managed
by the Incident Management Committee (IMC), which reports to the
Group Security Department. In connection with its internal control policy
and security policy, these organizational, functional, technical and legal
security measures are subject to continuous controls that include testing
(intrusion tests, social engineering tests, phishing tests, cyber crisis
management tests, etc.) and campaigns to raise awareness.

Risk factors and control
2.4 Industrial risks

2.4 Industrial risks

The areas of activity in which the Group operates entail major industrial
risks capable of causing harm to individuals and property, and exposing
it to claims for civil, criminal and environmental liability. These risks may
concern facilities that belong to the Group or are managed by the Group.
‘on behalf of third parties (manufacturers or local authorities), or facilities

where the Group's employees work. The industrial safety of the facilities
that the Group operates is one of its major concerns. The handling of
these risks is subject to in-depth monitoring and specific targeted
investments, and audits of the facilities in question are performed
regularly.

2.4.1

The Group operates and builds systems for gas transmission,
distribution and storage, regasification and gas liquefaction facilities,
bio-methanization plants, power plants, and hydro facilities, and
provides services in an industrial environment. Some of these facilities
are Classified as “upper tier” Seveso sites.

Risks can stem, for example, from operating incidents or design flaws or
from external events beyond the Group's control (including third-party
actions and natural disasters). Industrial accidents can cause injuries,
loss of life or major property and/or environmental damage, as well as
activity interruptions and operating losses.

The Group carries out its industrial activities in compliance with a
framework of safety regulations, including the “Seveso Ill” European
directive. These industrial risks are controlled by implementing a safety
management system at these sites based on the principle of continuous
improvement, which is intended to reduce the level of residual risk by
responding to the highest risks as a priority. Moreover, industrial safety

Industrial facilities and Seveso sites

is part of the Group’s internal control program. The Group conducts
periodic audit and control missions to ensure that these measures are
effectively implemented.

A specific action plan for protecting industrial control systems linked to
industrial processes has been implemented and is updated according to
changes in threat. It aims to prevent the risk of activity interruption or
accidents due to cyber-attacks.

For the greatest part, these risks are covered by insurance policies. In
the event of a major claim, these policies could prove insufficient (see
Section 2.1.3 “Risk and insurance coverage”)

A Group Industrial Safety Committee meets twice a year, and more
often if there is a specific issue that needs to be addressed, mainly to
encourage the inter-BU and inter-Métier exchange of information on
risks and accidents and the sharing of best practices in the Group's
various activities.

2.4.2 Pollution of the surrounding environment

Facilities that the Group owns or manages on behalf of third parties may
entail risks of damage to the natural environment (air, water, soil, habitat
and biodiversity), and may pose health risks to consumers, neighboring
residents, employees and subcontractors. These health and
environmental risks are governed by strict national and international
regulations. Non-compliance with or violation of these environmental
standards could have a significant negative impact on the Group's
image, its business, financial situation, earnings and outlook, and trigger

its liability as a legal entity. Any amounts set aside, insured or
guaranteed may be insufficient. Complaints and convictions relating to
the environment are detailed in Section 3.5.4.9, “Active prevention of
environmental risks”.

Health and environmental risks are regularly monitored by the Group, by
external auditors and by government authorities, both for operational
sites and closed facilities, such as former gas plants.

2.4.3 Risks of nuclear activities

The Group has established governance principles for the operation,
maintenance and decommissioning of nuclear power plants based on its
experience as an operator and service provider. It is also active in
employee recruitment, training and retention, both for facilities in
operation and nuclear services entities, and is involved in developing
new services.

In Belgium, Electrabel, a Group subsidiary, owns and operates seven
pressurized water reactors at two nuclear power stations at Doel and

Tihange. Since the commissioning of the first reactor in 1974, these
sites have not experienced any major nuclear safety incidents that could
have resulted in danger to employees, subcontractors, the general
population or the environment. However, they could present civil liability
risks for Electrabel, specifically in the event of a nuclear accident or the
discharging of large quantities of radioactive material into the
environment.

(1) Directive 96/82/EC (Seveso Il), amended and superseded by Directive 2012/18/EU ("Seveso Il).

All individuals working at Group nuclear power plants have the
appropriate qualifications and are aware of their personal responsibility
with regard to nuclear safety, in particular control room operators.
During operations, compliance with safety and security rules and
conditions at the facilities are subject to inspection by the Belgian
Federal Agency for Nuclear Control (FANC), assisted by Bel-V, its
technical support subsidiary. Independent checks are also carried out
by Electrabel’s nuclear safety department, which reports directly to its
Chief Executive Officer, independently of the line management of the
nuclear power sites. In addition, both nuclear sites have OHSAS 18001,
ISO 14001 and EMAS certification.

Electrabel takes into account feedback from accidents or incidents, in
order to continue to improve the safety and security of its facilities (the
most severe natural disasters, risks of cyber attack and sabotage). The
terrorist risk is addressed with the competent authorities of the Belgian
State.

In order to strengthen the safety culture at Doel and Tihange, Electrabel,
in agreement with the FANC, has set up the CORE (COmmon
REsponsibility) plan, which concerns the central functions and the two
nuclear sites. The plan was closed in October 2018 with the agreement
of the FANG, as the actions undertaken had become an integral part of
the management system and monitoring in the context of inspections
relating to the management system.

In 2015, hydrogen-induced flaws, created during the vessel
manufacturing process, were detected in the vessel walls of the Doel 3
and Tihange 2 reactors. The recommissioning of the reactors was
authorized at the end of November 2015 by the FANC and confirmed
during inspections in 2016 and 2017.

In October 2017, during a planned shutdown, the concrete ceiling of the
Doel 3 reactor bunker was found to have degraded. The same kind of
degradation was discovered in reactors with a similar bunker design:
Tihange 3, Doel 4 and Tihange 2. Stripping of the damaged areas

showed anomalies at Tinange 2 and 3 in the positioning of the concrete
frames of the bunker, which had been present since the building was
constructed. These buildings house second-level emergency systems
such as emergency pumps and diesel generators. The building has to
be able to withstand external events, so that these emergency systems.
are guaranteed to operate at all times. The extent of the degradation
and the anomalies identified during inspection calls into question the
ability of these buildings to withstand an external accident such as a
falling aircraft. Electrabel decided to adapt the review program for its
nuclear power plants in order to inspect and repair the degraded areas.

In April 2018, Electrabel found a minor leak in the emergency water
cooling circuit of the Doel 1 reactor. The reactor was stopped after this
event, and the maintenance review of the Doel 1 reactor was brought
forward so that the repair could be carried out. Electrabel decided to
inspect the second pipe in the same water cooling circuit of Doel 1, as
well as the pipes of Doel 2, as it has the same reactor cooling system.

The risk of one or more nuclear units not being available for technical or
safety reasons is one of Electrabel's major risks, and could have an
impact on its performance objectives.

Following the discovery in 2013 of a gel-like substance on the surface of
barrels of medium level radioactive waste (originating in the Doel plant
and stored at Belgoprocess), waste conditioning processes at the Doel
and Tihange sites were subject to additional checks by ONDRAF, the
Belgian National Agency for Radioactive Waste and Enriched Fissile
Material. As a result, the accreditations for a number of processes were
either not renewed or were withdrawn. Several performance tests have
been established to meet all the ONDRAF requirements and regain the
accreditations. At this time, the accreditations have been regained,
except for two categories at Doel and one at Tihange. The situation
regarding the storage capacity and availability of waste treatment
facilities remains complex. Temporary solutions have had to be
developed to increase storage capacity at the two generation sites.

2.4.4 Exploration & production of hydrocarbons

After the sale of its hydrocarbon exploration and production business to Neptune in early 2018, ENGIE is now only a minority co-shareholder in the

Touat project in Algeria, as Neptune is the operator.

2.5 Financial risks

2.5.1 Commodities market risk

The Group is chiefly exposed to two kinds of commodity market risk:
price risk directly related to fluctuating market prices, and volume risk
(weather risk and/or risk depending on economic activity). The Group is
exposed to these risks, particularly with regard to gas, electricity, coal,
oil and oil-based products, other fuels, CO, and other green or white
products related to the energy transition (Guarantees of Origin, energy
savings certificates and the Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (CRM)
(note 18.2 of Section 6.2.2 “Notes to consolidated financial statements).

With the exception of trading activities, market risks are assessed by
means of their impact on EBITDA. Accordingly, the main risk indicators
for managing the energy portfolios include sensitivity to unit price
changes, EBITDA at Risk, portfolio hedging ratios and stress tests
based on predefined unfavorable scenarios. For trading activities, and in
accordance with market standards, risk indicators include sensitivities,
Value at Risk (VaR) and stress tests (see Note 18.1 of Section 6.2.2
“Notes to consolidated financial statements").

2.5.2 Counterparty risk

Due to its financial and operational activities, the Group is exposed to
the risk of its counterparties default (customers, suppliers, partners,
intermediaries, and banks).

The impact of this may be felt in terms of payment (non-payment for
services or deliveries made), delivery (non-delivery of supplies or services
that have been paid for) or assets (loss of financial investments).

Following the introduction of the new IFRS 9 standard, the Group has
defined a Group-level methodology to assess counterparty risk, which is

The Group has implemented a specific governance process to manage
market and counterparty risks based on (i) the general principle of
separation of risk management and risk control, (ii) a Group-level Energy
Market Risks Committee that is responsible for validating risk policies
and monitoring consolidated exposure, (iii) following the market and
counterparty risk mandates, and (iv) a specific risk control function
coordinated by the Finance Department.

Part of its electricity generation activity outside Europe is secured by
long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) in which variations in
operating expenses, in particular for fuels, are transferred as
“pass-throughs” into electricity sale prices. This substantially limits
exposure to fuel price fluctuation risks, even if the transfer is not perfect
in some contracts.

The Group also uses derivatives to offer hedging instruments to its
clients and to hedge its own positions.

described in note 18.2 of Section 6.2.2 “Notes to consolidated financial
statements”.

These risks are managed via framework agreements that use standard
mechanisms such as third-party guarantees, netting agreements and
margin calls, or dedicated hedging instruments. Operational activities
may also involve prepayments or suitable recovery procedures
(especially for retail customers).

2.5.3 Foreign exchange risk

The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk, which is defined as the
impact on the balance sheet and income statement of exchange rate
fluctuations, in the performance of its operational and financial activities.
This risk is broken down into (i) a transactional risk related to current
operations, (ii) a specific transactional risk related to investment,
merger-acquisition or disposal projects, (iii) a translational risk related to
the value of assets outside the Eurozone, and (iv) a risk related to the
consolidation of the subsidiaries’ accounts in euros where the functional
currency is not the euro. The three main exposures to translational and
consolidation risks correspond, in order of importance, to assets
in US dollars, Brazilian real and British pounds.

For an analysis of foreign exchange risk sensitivity, see Note 18.1.3.2 of
Section 6.2.2 “Notes to consolidated financial statements”.

As part of the Group’s foreign exchange risk policy, recurring
transactional risk is subject to systematic hedging as soon as this risk is
material and almost certain to arise. During the examination of
investment projects, the specific transactional risk is subject to a
case-by-case hedging strategy. Finally, translational risk is covered by
partial hedging strategies subject to a reasonable hedging cost and
sufficient market liquidity in relation to the risk of currency depreciation.

2.5.4 Interest rate risk

The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations. The Group's
objective is to control its borrowing costs by limiting the impact of
interest rate changes on its income statement. To do this, the Group
seeks to achieve a balance between fixed, floating and protected
floating (“capped floating”) rates. This distribution may change within the
limits set by management according to the market situation.

The breakdown of the outstanding financial debt by type of interest rate
and the analysis of sensitivity to interest rate risk are presented,

2.5.5 Liquidity risk

Liquidity is based on the regular renewal of various financing tools
available to the Group such as credit lines, bond financing or other
financing tools, to ensure their availability and their adequacy in relation
to financing requirements. These credit facilities are pre-agreed and
appropriate for the scale of its operations and for the timing of
contractual debt repayments. Note 18.3 of Section6.3 “Notes to
consolidated financial statements” explains the distribution of the various.
forms of financing used.

2.5.6 Impairment risk

Assumptions and estimates are made to calculate the recoverable value
of goodwill and tangible and intangible fixed assets. They particularly
refer to market outlook and changes in the regulatory framework, which
are used for the measurement of cash flows, which sensitivity varies
depending on the activity, and the determination of the discount rate.

Risk factors and control
2.5 Financial risks

respectively, in Note 18.1.4.1 and Note 18.1.4.2 of Section 6.3 “Notes
to consolidated financial statements”

In order to manage the interest rate structure for its net debt, the Group
uses hedging instruments, particularly interest rate swaps and options.
Managed centrally, rate positions are reviewed periodically and when
any new financing is raised. This management is subject to a risk
mandate: any substantial change in the rate structure requires prior
approval from the Finance Department.

ENGIE pools the majority of the cash flow requirements and surpluses of
the Group’s majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as most of their
medium- and long-term external financing requirements. Financing
vehicles (long-term and short-term) provide centralization, as do the
Group's dedicated cash-pooling vehicles in France, Belgium and
Luxembourg.

Any changes to these assumptions could have a significant effect on the
amount of the recoverable value and could lead to changes in the
impairment to be recognized (see Note 14 of Section 6.3 “Notes to
consolidated financial statements”).

2.5.7 Equity risk

As of December 31, 2018, the Group holds a number of
non-consolidated interests in listed companies (see Note 17.1.1.1 of
Section 6.3 “Notes to consolidated financial statements”), the value of
which fluctuates according to the position of the relevant companies
and/or trends in the world stock markets.

In addition, the Group holds interests in listed companies consolidated
using the equity method, including SUEZ (see Note 4 in Section 6.3
“Notes to consolidated financial statements”), for which a significant or
extended fall in the share price below the value on the balance sheet is
an indication of impairment.

2.5.8 Tax risk

Given their tightening budget constraints and pressure from the media,
national governments are increasingly introducing anti-abuse measures,
both general and special, with a broad and subjective scope, and are
giving their supervisory authorities increased powers of investigation.
This has created a climate of tax insecurity that may have an impact on
the Group's results. Similarly, the European Commission's interventions.
in both state aid (especially the querying of prior agreements issued by
authorities that were designed to confirm the complex tax treatment of
certain transactions and consequently give companies legal security)
and draft directives in the area of combating tax avoidance (see ATAD1
and 2") and the European harmonization project (see CCCTB ) have
created uncertainty and may impact the Group’s results over various

(1) ATAD: Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive
(2) CCTB: Common Consolidaded Tax Base

time periods (see Note 28 of Section6.2 “Notes to consolidated
financial statements").

The ENGIE group has established a tax policy that has been published
on its website since 2015, along with the corporation tax amounts
incurred each year in the main jurisdictions where it operates. This policy
mainly states that the Group undertakes to respect with honesty and
integrity the tax laws and regulations that apply to it and to pay its fair
share of taxes in the countries where it operates. To this end, internal
procedures, including regular control mechanisms, have been put in
place to ensure its proper application in the countries concerned. These
procedures cover both corporate tax practices and the choice of
location of Group structures. Furthermore, tax practices within the

Group comply with its Code of Ethics and its environmental, social and
societal principles. The Group therefore considers that it is compliant

2.5.9 Pension funding risk

A significant portion of the Group pensions commitments and the assets
associated with these plans are concentrated in France and in Belgium.
Other defined-benefit pension plans are mainly located in Europe and
Brazil

In recent years, the Group has terminated a number of defined-benefit
plans and replaced them with defined-contribution plans. The
defined-benefit plans still in operation include, in France, the special
Electricity and Gas Industry (EGI) plan, which is a statutory plan.

Note 21 of Section 6.2.2 “Notes to consolidated financial statements”
details the items measured and recognized.

The calculation of commitments is estimated via actuarial methods using
methodologies, assumptions and models to assess liabilities or
determine asset allocations and associated risks that could have a
significant impact on hedging levels and financing requirements.

In France, commitments within the scope of the EGI are estimated using
actuarial assumptions and rules governing, respectively, benefits paid
out by statutory plans and amounts that remain the Group's

Commercial Code relating to combating tax fraud.

responsibility. These assumptions and rules may be subject to changes
that increase the Group's commitments and therefore require an
increase in the relative relevant provisions.

Substantial commitments exist in the form of other post-employment
benefits and other long-term employee benefits, in addition to pension
liabilities. These mainly comprise energy-related benefits provided to
retired employees within the scope of the EGI.

Hedging levels and financing requirements for the Group's pension
plans vary according to the performance of financial markets and asset
allocations, as well as interest and inflation rates and changes in the
applicable legal and regulatory framework.

For some plans outside the scope of the EGI, ENGIE may be required to
fully or partly finance any difference between the market value of these
assets and the hedging levels projected for these plans, or any
insufficiency in the return on the assets in respect of the guaranteed
minimum average rates.

Risk factors and control
2.6 Internal corporate control procedures

2.6 Internal corporate control procedures

2.6.1

Internal control standard

ENGIE's internal control is based on the COSO II model of the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and the AMF reference framework. It is based on five components:
control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and
communication, and monitoring activities.

Internal control objectives

ENGIE’s internal control aims to provide reasonable assurance that the
following objectives are being met:

= compliance with laws and regulations;
reliability of accounting and financial information;

= effectiveness and efficiency of operations.

Internal control definitions and objectives

Internal control is constantly being adapted to changes in the Group's
organization and businesses and contributes to the rolling out of its
strategy.

Internal control limits

Internal control cannot provide absolute assurance, particularly due to
possible dysfunctions relating to error or human failure and arbitrage
between the costs relating to the potential occurrence of a risk and the
cost of the measures designed to prevent it.

INCOME program

On the basis of financial materiality and an analysis of risks, each year
ENGIE updates the scope of the most significant controlled entities that
are subject to centralized monitoring through the INCOME program (181
entities in 2018).

2.6.2

2.6.2.1. Organization of internal control

The organization of internal control complies with the principles of the
Group's organization, particularly decentralization, autonomy and the
accountability of managers. In the context of the authorities delegated
by the Chief Executive Officer, each manager of a BU or entity is
responsible for implementing and overseeing an internal control system
that conforms to the applicable regulatory framework and any specific
features thereof. The Internal Control Department reports to the Finance
Department and is in charge of leading and coordinating the system at
Group level. It proposes and updates a framework, a methodology and
an information system that centralizes all the data relating to the rolling
out and assessment of the system's effectiveness.

2.6.2.2 Elements of the general compliance
framework

Ethics and compliance

In line with its values and its undertakings, ENGIE aims to act in
compliance with the laws and regulations in force in the countries where
it operates in all circumstances. To this end, the Group has established
an ethics policy that guides its strategic decisions, management and
professional practices. It also has the necessary tools to measure
compliance with this undertaking (see Section 4.2 “Ethics, compliance
and privacy”).

Recruitment, training and skills management

The quality, commitment and skills of its employees are necessary
conditions for the management of the Group's operations. Recruitment,
training and skills management policies are key elements of the internal
control system, ensuring the required level of competence in all areas,
particularly those in which specific expertise is needed, in accordance
with the Group's values (see Section 3.4 “Social information”).

Internal control organization and stakeholders

Information systems

The digital and IS strategy, and the IT solutions policies and standards,
are defined by the Group Digital and IT Department. The security of
information systems of the sectors and central functions of the Group is
the responsibility of the corresponding functional departments, in
accordance with these policies and standards. Similarly, the BUs are
responsible for the security of their information systems under the
control of the Group Digital and IT Department and, for the industrial
control systems (ICSs), under the control of the Global Care
Department, in cooperation with the Group Digital and IT Department,
which coordinates the technical actions to secure these ICSs for sites
classed as critical and sensitive.

Important subjects for internal control, such as the segregation of duties
and the management of access rights, are taken into account during the
design stage of new information systems and regularly reviewed
thereafter.

The IT managers of the BUs are, among other things, in charge of the
information system recovery plans, while the information systems
security officer of the BU is responsible for cybersecurity.

Internal policies and standards

All the decisions, standards and procedures issued by corporate
defining the Group's methods of operation are available on its intranet.
The Finance Department provides all the procedures and rules intended
to ensure the reliability of the accounting and financial information
applicable to the Group's entities. The Internal Control Department
provides all the Group’s employees with the following procedures and
best practices:

= methodological guides for entities relating to the definition,
assessment and coordination of an internal control system adapted to
the nature of their activities;

2.6 Internal corporate control procedures

= internal control frawork (48 sets in 2018) covering business, support
and global processes (e.g.: sales, procurement, payroll, information
systems, accounting, tax, investment , cash management and
personal data protection). Each framework details the intrinsic risks
and the key controls designed to manage them;

= best practice on subjects such as the segregation of duties, the role
of directors, data protection, etc.

These guidelines can be tailored as needed to the BUs and entities.

2.6.2.3. The system's stakeholders

The stakeholders and their respective roles are presented according to a
“three lines of defense” management model, overseen by ENGIE's
governance bodies.

The Group’s governance bodies

The Board of Directors ensures the proper functioning of internal control
within the Group. The Executive Committee defines the organization and
responsibilities of managers and ensures compliance with the
delegations of authorities. An annual review of internal control is
submitted to the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee.

First line of management

The operational managers, who are responsible for the internal control
of the processes of their entities, constitute a key element of the system.
They ensure that control activities are effectively implemented, analyze
the results, correct any deficiencies and endeavor to improve the
efficiency of their system.

The Management Committees of the BUs and entities are responsible
for establishing and overseeing the internal control covering the scope of
their activities. They play a vital role in the quality of the control
environment: promoting Group values, defining the organization,
assessing results, communicating, etc.

Second line of management

This line of management is organized into sectors, overseen by the
Group's functional departments.

The Finance Department carries out internal accounting and financial
control (see the relevant section below). Within this department, the
Insurance division is involved in risk identification, loss prevention, and
the definition and implementation of hedging strategies.

The General Secretariat helps to make the Group's operations and the
decisions of its managers legally secure, particularly in the following
areas: commitments, litigation, arbitration, studies and actions to protect
the criminal liability of the Group and its managers, embargo, company
law, financial and stock market regulation, intellectual property law,
competition law and regulation and financial law.

Within the General Secretariat, the Ethics, Compliance and Privacy
Department is responsible for drafting ENGIE’s ethics and compliance
rules, as well as ensuring that such rules are actually applied in
accordance with the laws and regulations in force.

The Corporate Societal Relations Department is responsible for
compliance with environmental laws and regulations throughout ENGIE.
It assesses the environmental maturity of the Group's various
businesses and is in charge of regulatory environmental reporting.

The Internal Control Department coordinates the implementation of the
internal control policy approved by the Executive Board. It coordinates a
network of representatives who are in charge, under the responsibility of
the managers of the entities, of guiding internal control, and organizes
training and information sessions. It monitors and anticipates external
regulatory developments as well as changes to the Group, in order
adapt the relevant procedures.

Third line of management: the Internal Audit
Department

Reporting to the Chief Executive Officer, the Audit Department operates
throughout the Group in accordance with an annual plan based on risk
analysis and interviews with the operational managers. This plan may be
expanded at the request of the Executive Committee so that it covers
priority subjects for the Group (subjects related to ethics, personal data
protection, etc.). Submitted for approval to the Audit Committee, this
plan is designed to cover all of the entities and enables the quality of the
business control and management environment to be checked.

Internal Audit also assesses the internal control covering operational and
financial processes and the reliability of the self-assessment of controls
carried out under the INCOME program.

Internal Audit presents its conclusions to the managers of the BUs and
entities and regularly reports on its key observations and on the
progress of the associated action plans to the Executive Committee and
the Audit Committee. It regularly meets with the Statutory Auditors to
share internal control analyses.

2.6.3

2.6.3.1 Organization and stakeholders

The Group Accounting Department is in charge of financial reporting,
preparing the parent company financial statements of ENGIE and the
financial vehicles managed by Corporate, producing the consolidated
financial statements, and liaising with the accounting departments of the
AMF. It establishes the Group's accounting principles and oversees their
implementation to ensure compliance with the accounting standards. It
monitors the evolution of standards and their impact on the Group's
financial statements and adapts the principles accordingly. Within the
Group Accounting Department, the Group Consolidations Department
and the Accounting Standards Department optimize the handling and
resolution of complex technical problems. These departments

and maintains the Group's management control toolkit and oversees the
rolling out of these toolkits to the various entities. It guides the
Management Control sector in defining and implementing processes
and tools.

The IT Solutions Department Finance Sector is a centralized activity at
the corporate level that is responsible for the |S strategy of the Finance
Function and for the determination and coordination of the IT solutions
policies, rules and standards applicable to the sector. Applications and

infrastructure are distributed to the BUs and Métiers in accordance with
the policies defined by corporate. The IT Solutions Department Finance
Sector oversees the implementation of the Group's IS security policy
within the sector and monitors and plans IS spending and investments.

The consolidated reporting entities all use the SAP software package
“Business Objects Financial Consolidation” for the consolidation of the
Group's financial statements and management reporting. This
application is jointly managed by the Accounting IT Center of Expertise
(which handles administrative tasks and system configuration and
provides operating assistance to users) and the Information Systems.
Department, which is in charge of specific underlying infrastructures.

The Group Tax Department is responsible for defining and rolling out
the Group's tax policy. It coordinates the validation of tax returns and
transfer pricing documentation and ensures that tax data are uniformly
reported. As it has a central administrative role, the Group Tax
Department is hierarchically responsible for all tax activities. Generally
speaking, it is closely supported by the Finance Departments of the
BUs, which assume responsibility for tax in terms of compliance and
transparency.

The Investor Relations Department is in charge of relations with the
analysts that cover the Group and, more broadly, with institutional
investors. With regard to management information, the Management
Control sector of corporate is the Investor Relations Department's only
source of information. All other information arising from the legal
reporting process, that is classed as regulated information pursuant to
AMF rules, is provided by the Group Accounting Department. Lastly, the
department oversees and coordinates the process of market
communication (quarterly, half-yearly and annual financial information
and information on major transactions) in collaboration with the General
Secretariat.

The Finance Departement also uses the current “Missions and operating
principles of financial communication" procedure, which sets out
management principles for the Group's financial communication and
clearly defines its activities in areas concerning analyst and investor
relations and market intelligence.

Through the functional lines, all of these corporate departments oversee
internal control within their respective areas via the Finance Departments.
of the BUs, which are specifically responsible for:

= producing the separate financial statements of the legal entities and
accounting bodies that comprise them and converting them
according to IFRS. corporate is responsible for consolidating these
converted data;

= implementing internal control procedures at all the operating
subsidiaries, as well as decentralized management control (see the
section entitled “Setting objectives and coordination” below).

Risk factors and control
2.6 Internal corporate control procedures

2.6.3.2 Consolidation process

The Group Accounting Department is in charge of producing the
consolidated financial statements, supported by the BU consolidation,
Enterprise Performance Management and the management control
teams. It manually updates the accounting principles and closing
instructions disseminated before each phase of consolidation.

Each of these entities carries out controls in its own area of responsibility
to ensure that Group accounting standards and policies have been
circulated and applied correctly. This principle of subsidiarity allows
second-tier controls to be applied to the prepared information, at the
following levels:

= at the BU level for information passed on to this level by the reporting
entities;

= at the corporate level for information passed on to this level by the
BUs

The CEO and CFO of each BU attest to the quality and
comprehensiveness of the financial information provided to the Group
by means of a representation letter.

Discussions with the Statutory Auditors enhance the quality of financial
information with respect to the standards, particularly in the case of
complex situations that are open to interpretation

2.6.3.3 Setting objectives and coordination

Every year, each of the Group's BUs produces a medium-term business
plan (MTBP), a budget and budget re-estimates. The Enterprise
Performance Management Department, which reports to the Finance
Department, prepares instructions for this purpose for each BU,
including details such as macroeconomic hypotheses, financial and
non-financial indicators, the timetable and the segmentation of the
scope of activity. Each BU is responsible for sending these instructions
to the subsidiaries and reporting entities within its scope after tailoring
them to the specific characteristics of its business activity.

The BU Committee, which is chaired by the Executive Board and brings
together the corporate departments and the operational and financial
departments of each BU, approves for each BU the objectives set for
the following year, the corresponding budget and the outlook beyond
the current year derived from the budget process and the MTBP, to be
used as the basis for the impairment testing of goodwill and long-term
assets. The Group's consolidated budget and MTBP are presented to
Audit Committee and the Strategy, Investment and Technology
Committee before being submitted to the Board of Directors.

The BU Committees enable regular dialogue between the BUs and the
Group based on analyses of real current data, forecasts and past data.

2.6 Internal corporate control procedures

2.6.4 Formalization and coordination of internal control

Within the scope of the INCOME program, oversight of the internal
control system takes place at several levels:

= the operational managers oversee the correct implementation of the
control activities of their processes, assess the results and rectify any
weaknesses detected;

= a formalized annual process of self-assessment of key controls,
carried out with the support of the individuals responsible for internal
control within the entities, taking into account the entities’ control
processes and general control environment;

= Internal Audit reviews the quality of the self-assessments and the
pertinence of the action plans.

Outside the scope of the INCOME program, internal control toolkits and
a specific questionnaire are provided to the entities. These enable
sensitive areas to be covered, such as the separation of tasks and the
protection of assets.

The Group also implements a system of commitment involving the
managers of the BUs and the main functional departments concerning
the establishment, oversight and effectiveness of an internal control
system covering their respective areas of responsibility.

Each year, meetings take place between the Internal Control
Department and the Statutory Auditors in order to share analyses of the
quality of the existing systems and to identify, where necessary, action
plans to rectify any weaknesses detected.

2.6.5 Recent actions to strengthen the system

The most significant actions are as follows:

= the progress of the Common Finance project for integration of the
information systems of the BUs and the subsidiaries;

= the design and roll-out, with the Group Ethics and Compliance
Department, of a set of internal control toolkits focused on personal
data protection;

= the strengthening of internal control relating to the vigilance plan (see
Section 4.3 “Vigilance plan”);

@ the in-depth analysis of incidents reported to the Group Ethics and
Compliance Department in order to make the prevention system
more efficient.
