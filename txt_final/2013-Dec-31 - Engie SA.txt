Information on the share capital and shareholding

5.2 SHAREHOLDING

5.2.4 Golden share

Under the terms of Act No. 2004-803 of August 9, 2004 as amended
by Act No. 2006-1537 of December 7, 2006, the State must at all
times hold more than one third of the Company's capital.

Pursuant to Article 24.1 of Act No. 2004-803 of August 9, 2004 and
Decree No. 2007-1790 of December 20, 2007, the share capital of
GDF SUEZ includes a golden share (resulting from the conversion of
one ordinary share) which is held by the French State, and is aimed at
protecting France's critical interests in the energy sector and ensuring
the continuity and safeguarding of energy supplies. In application of the
Act of December 7, 2006 set out above, the golden share is granted
to the French State indefinitely and entitles it to veto decisions made
by GDF SUEZ, or its French subsidiaries, which directly or indirectly
seek to sell in any form whatsoever, transfer operations, assign as
collateral or guarantee or change the intended use of certain assets
covered by the Decree, if it considers they could harm French energy
interests as regards the continuity and safeguarding of supplies.

Under the terms of Article 2 of Decree No. 2007-1790 of December 20,
2007, and its Appendix, the assets covered by the French State's
right of veto pursuant to the golden share are:

> natural gas transmission pipelines located in France;
> assets related to the distribution of natural gas in France;
» underground natural gas storage located in France;

> liquefied natural gas facilities located in France.

5.2.5 Dividend distribution policy

In accordance with Decree No. 93-1296 of December 13, 1993
applied pursuant to Article 10 of Act No. 86-912 (as amended)
relating to privatizations and concerning certain rights attached to the
golden share, and to Decree No. 2007-1790 of December 20, 2007,
all decisions of this nature must be reported to the Minister of the
Economy.

The decisions mentioned above are deemed to be authorized if the
Minister of the Economy does not veto them within one month of
the date of their disclosure, as recorded by a receipt issued by the
administration. This period may be extended for a period of 15 days
by order of the Minister of the Economy. Before the expiration of the
aforementioned one-month period, the Minister of the Economy may
waive the right to veto. If there is a veto, the Minister of the Economy
will communicate the reasons of his or her decision to the company
in question. The decision of the Minister of the Economy may be
appealed.

Pursuant to Decree 93-1296 of December 13, 1993, any transaction
executed in violation of Decree 2007-1790 of December 20, 2007 is
automatically null and void.

As of the date of this Reference Document, to GDF SUEZ's
knowledge, there is no agreement relating to an option on any entity
that is a member of the GDF SUEZ Group or any agreement which, if
implemented, could lead to a change in its control.

GDF SUEZ seeks to pursue a dynamic and attractive dividend
distribution policy. The Group's objectives described in Section 6.1.1.9
“Outlook” do not, however, constitute a commitment by the
Company, and future dividends will be assessed on a year-by-year
basis depending on the Company's performance, financial position
and any other factor considered relevant by the Board of Directors
when preparing its proposals to the General Shareholders’ Meetings.

6.1 MANAGEMENT REPORT

6.1 MANAGEMENT REPORT

6.1.1 Management report

Data included in the income statement, statement of financial position
and statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013
are based on pro forma figures"), calculated as if SUEZ Environnement
had been accounted for under the equity method as of January 1,
2012. The basis used to prepare this pro forma data is disclosed in
Section 6.1.1.7. to this report.

In a persistently tough economic and regulatory environment — mainly
in Europe - the GDF SUEZ Group delivered 2013 operating results
in line with guidance while at the same time carrying out significant
impairments of its assets (property, plant and equipment, goodwill
and other intangible assets), thereby acknowledging in its financial
statements the structural changes that are impacting two of its
European businesses in particular: thermal power generation and
underground natural gas storage.

Revenues were down slightly by 0.8% on a reported basis to
€81.3 billion compared with 2012 (organic growth of 3.0%). The
negative impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and currency
effects were partially compensated by higher gas and electricity sales
in France due to broadly cold climatic conditions and the upturn in
LNG sales as part of arbitrage transactions in early 2013.

EBITDA, which amounted to €13.4 billion for the year, was down
8.1% on a reported basis (organic decrease of 2.7%). This decrease
in reported EBITDA was attributable to negative currency effects,
the loss of earnings from entities sold as part of the Group's asset
portfolio optimization program, lower electricity prices, the end of free
carbon allowances and a decline in production in the Exploration -
Production business. These adverse impacts were partially offset by
the positive impact of the commissioning of new assets, cold climatic
conditions in France, strong operating performances and the results
of the Group's performance action plan.

Current operating income declined by 13.8% on a reported basis
(negative organic growth of 7.8%) to €7.2 billion, reflecting the drop in

6.1.1.1. Revenues and earnings trends

EBITDA and higher net additions to provisions, partially offset by lower
depreciation and amortization charges.

On a pro forma basis, net income/(loss) Group share totaled
-€9.7 billion in 2013, down €11.3 billion year on year. In 2013, net
income/(loss) Group share was mainly impacted by the impairment of
the Group's assets in the consolidated financial statements.

Net recurring income Group share which amounted to €3.4 billion
was down 10.1% year on year. The decline in current operation
income was partially offset by lower recurring financial expenses
due to a more active debt management. Moreover the tax charge
decreased despite a higher effective recurring tax rate.

Cash generated from operations before income tax and working
capital requirements, which amounted to €13.3 billion, was
€1.3 billion lower than for the year ended December 31, 2012, due
mainly to the drop in EBITDA.

Net debt, which stood at €29.8 billion at end-December 2013,
was €6.8 billion lower than one year earlier and mainly reflected the
following items: (i) cash flow from operations (CFFO) of €10.4 billion
less gross investments for the period of €7.5 billion; (ii) dividends of
€3.5 billion paid to GDF SUEZ SA shareholders; (iii) the proceeds from
the issue of hybrid notes by GDF SUEZ in early July 2013 (€1.7 billion);
(iv) the impact of disposals carried out as part of the asset portfolio
optimization program, including the sale of SPP (Slovakia) and 50% of
the Portuguese energy businesses; and (v) the classification of certain
French wind farms and the Group's stake in the Jirau dam as assets
held for sale.

Financial statements

Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013
amounted to €81.3 billion, down 0.8% compared with 2012. On
an organic basis (excluding the impact of changes in the scope of
consolidation and exchange rates), revenues moved up by 3.0%.

Changes in the scope of consolidation had a negative €2.1 billion
impact, mainly corresponding to disposals (sale by Energy Europe
of SPP in Slovakia and by Energy International of Maestrale in Italy
and Germany, and the disposal of the US thermal power plant of Red
Hills and Astoria Energy, Phase |) and the change to equity method
accounting following the loss of control of Senoko (Singapore), Al Hidd
(Bahrain) and Sohar Power Company SAOG (Oman).

EBITDA TRENDS

6.1 MANAGEMENT REPORT

Exchange rates had a negative €0.9 billion impact on Group revenues
due to the appreciation of the euro against the other major currencies.

Organic revenue performance varied across the Group's business
lines: Global Gas & LNG and Infrastructures reported strong growth
for the period, while revenues were up slightly at Energy Europe and
Energy International and stable at Energy Services.

EBITDA declined by 8.1% to €13.4 billion over the period. Excluding
the impact of changes in exchange rates and in the scope of
consolidation, the decrease in EBITDA came out at 2.7%.

Pro forma, in millions of euros

&
s
x
&

Changes in the scope of consolidation had a negative €479 million
impact, in line with the impact on revenues. Additions to the scope of
consolidation were few in number and not material.

Changes in exchange rates had a negative €335 million impact due to
the appreciation of the euro against the other major currencies (mainly
the Brazilian real, US dollar and Norwegian krone).

On an organic basis, EBITDA was down 2.7% or €367 million.
Notwithstanding the impact of the Group's performance plan across
the business lines, this decline reflected the following trends:

» EBITDA for Energy International amounted to €3,871 million and
was up 4.2% on an organic basis due to the positive contribution of
newly-commissioned facilities, notably in Brazil, Peru and Thailand,
higher prices in Australia and a good performance by the LNG
business in the US. However, this was partially offset by lower
figures reported in Chile, difficult market conditions in the UK and
unfavorable climatic conditions in the US;

v

EBITDA for Energy Europe came in at €3,415 million, down 14.8%
on an organic basis, due to the fall in electricity market prices and
the end of free carbon allocations. These adverse impacts were
only partially offset by cold climatic conditions in 2013 and the
benefit of the gas price “catch-up” adjustments in France;

%,
D4
a

s
a

» EBITDA for Global Gas & LNG dropped €188 million or 8.2% on
an organic basis to €2,124 million, chiefly as a result of the fall
in production of the Exploration - Production business, due to
production outages at the Snavhit and Njord fields in the first and
second halves of 2013, respectively;

» EBITDA for Infrastructures climbed 10.5% on an organic basis to
€3,370 million, boosted by particularly favorable climatic conditions
in 2013 and the annual review of infrastructure access tariffs, and
despite lower storage capacity sales in France;

» EBITDA for Energy Services advanced by 3.8% on an organic basis
to €1,068 million, all its activities contributing to its performance.

Current operating income declined 7.8% on an organic basis
compared with 2012, to €7.2 billion. Net additions to provisions
were higher while net depreciation and amortization expenses edged
down due to impairment loss provisions taken on certain assets
at December 31, 2012 and to the decrease in production in the
Exploration - Production business, combined with an increase in the
Book of Reserves. After taking into account changes in the scope of
consolidation and exchange rates, current operating income for the
period declined by 13.8% on a reported basis.

(1) The Energy International business line also has a “headquarters” function, the costs for which are not broken down in the table above.
(2) Energy international business line has been reorganized into five business areas (previously six). Asia-Pacific now includes Australia, formerly a separate business area,
but no longer includes Pakistan which is now part of SAMEA (South Asia, Middle East and Africa). Turkey is now included in the UK & Other Europe business area. Prior

year figures have been restated to reflect this new organizational structure.

Energy International's revenues, at €14,833 million, fell 7.6% based
on reported figures and climbed 2.9% on an organic basis. These
changes reflect the impact of the asset portfolio optimization program
(accounting for a decrease of €860 million) and exchange rate
fluctuations (negative impact of €770 million, due to the strengthening
of the euro against all major currencies). They also reflect continued
organic growth driven by the commissioning of new power plants
in Thailand and Latin America as well as power price increases
implemented, primarily in Brazil, Thailand and Australia. Gas and
electricity sales reached respectively 79.6 TWh and 220.4 TWh.

EBITDA decreased by 10.1% on a reported basis to €3,871 million,
but showed an underlying increase of €157 million or 4.2% after taking
into account the negative impacts of divestments (€318 million) and
foreign exchange movements (€272 million). This increase reflects the
impact of the above mentioned newly commissioned plants and price
increases, as well as the strong performance of the LNG business in
the US and the impacts of the performance plan.

Current operating income, at €2,635 million, decreased by 9.2% on
a reported basis but increased by €143 million or 5.8% on an organic
basis, reflecting the increase in EBITDA partly offset by additional
depreciation charged against newly commissioned plants.

GDF swez Registration Document 2013

Latin America

Revenues for the Latin America region totaled €3,617 million,
down €209 million on a reported basis but up 3.0% on an organic
basis compared to 2012. In Brazil, higher sales resulted from the
full commissioning of the Estreito hydro power plant (1,090 MW)
combined with an increase in average sales prices, primarily due to
indexation linked to inflation. Peru trended upwards thanks to the
commissioning of the Chilca combined cycle plant (270 MW) and
the Ilo thermo plant (660 MW), as well as a rise in demand from
customers. In Chile, revenues decreased following a decline in LNG
sales as supply agreements gradually expired.

Electricity sales increased by 1.5 TWh to 54.3 TWh, while gas sales
were down 3.3 TWh, particularly in Chile, coming in at 11.4 TWh.

EBITDA totaled €1,475 million, representing a decrease of €44 million
or 2.9% on an organic basis, mainly reflecting:

> negative trends in Chile, mostly linked to coal plants’ (CTA/CTH)
forced outage during January 2013 and to the end of LNG high
margin gas supply agreements;


--- Page 6 ---

Financial statements

> a lower performance in Brazil, mostly due to adverse hydrological
conditions, partly offset by the commissioning of the final units at
Estreito and an increase in average prices for bilateral sales, mainly
due to inflation;

> positive trends in Peru, mainly due to the commissioning of the
Chilca combined cycle facility and of the llo thermo plant.

Current operating income amounted to €1,076 million, down
€14 million or 1.2% on an organic basis. A favorable change in the
LNG terminal's depreciation profile in Chile in line with the end of high
margin gas sales contracts and the start of re-gasification services
partially offset the downturn in EBITDA.

Asia-Pacific

Revenues for the region totaled €2,990 million, down 2.3% or
€69 million on a reported basis, reflecting the change of consolidation
method for Senoko in Singapore following a change in control.
However, revenues showed strong organic growth of 18.6% or
€469 million, primarily attributable to the commissioning of power
generation assets in Thailand (Gheco One and TNP2 in August 2012
and December 2012, respectively), as well as to higher electricity
prices in Australia following the introduction of the carbon emissions
reduction scheme on July 1, 2012 and a stronger performance from
the Australian retail business.

Electricity sales decreased by 0.8 TWh to 42.8 TWh, reflecting the
change of consolidation method for Senoko (negative impact of
2.7 TWh) and a decrease of 1.2 TWh in Australia, offset by an increase
of 3.1 TWh in Thailand. Natural gas sales increased by 1.0 TWh to
5.9 TWh.

EBITDA came in at €840 million, up €101 million (13.6%) based on
reported figures or €187 million (28.5%) on an organic basis. Organic
EBITDA growth mainly results from:

» a strong performance in Thailand, driven by increases in both
volumes (partly related to the maintenance cycle) and prices, and
by the commissioning of Gheco One and TNP2;

» higher prices in Australia and an improved performance from the
retail business, with higher margins and more accounts.

Current operating income amounted to €595 million, up €136 million
or 29.7% on an organic basis, reflecting EBITDA trends and the start
of depreciation at the recently commissioned plants of Gheco One
and TNP2.

6.1 MANAGEMENT REPORT

North America

Revenues for the North America region totaled €4,094 million,
representing a decrease of 7.2% based on reported figures and an
increase of 0.7% on an organic basis. This resulted from a strong
performance in the gas businesses and an improved operational
performance in Mexico, but was tempered by a fall in US wholesale
electricity pricing and compression in the US retail market.

Electricity sales increased by 2.0 TWh to 74.6 TWh on an organic
basis, after adjusting for divestments within the scope of the asset
portfolio optimization program, which reduced volumes by 6.1 TWh.
Natural gas sales "!, excluding intra-group transactions, fell by
10.9 TWh to 39.7 TWh, mainly due to fewer overall LNG cargoes
combined with more LNG diversions (intra-group sales).

EBITDA came in at €1,016 million, up 3.2% on an organic basis. The
strong performance from the LNG (improved margins versus 2012)
and Mexican businesses was partially offset by a decline in the overall
performance of the US power and retail businesses, which were
primarily impacted by mild weather conditions.

Current operating income totaled €626 million, representing an
increase of 5.7% on an organic basis, chiefly due to the EBITDA
improvement.

UK & Other Europe

Revenues for the region totaled €3,552 million, representing a
decrease of 5.8% on an organic basis. This primarily resulted from the
lower utilization of assets in Spain and Portugal and a drop in sales
volumes in the UK retail business.

Electricity sales amounted to 35.9 TWh, representing a decrease of
4.6 TWh. This is mainly due to lower volumes in Spain and Portugal
and in the UK retail business. It also reflects a reduction of 1.6 TWh
due to the asset portfolio optimization program in Continental Europe
and to the closure of certain power plants in the United Kingdom. Gas
sales were 22.5 TWh, down 4.1 TWh due to lower volumes for the UK
retail business and Turkish operations.

EBITDA of €481 million fell 9.5% on an organic basis. Power
production assets in the United Kingdom continued to face
challenging market conditions (particularly gas-fired plants) and were
also affected both by the end of free carbon allowances and by
the introduction of a carbon floor tax. These impacts were partially
mitigated by the implementation of cost-reduction actions, a favorable
one-off compensation payment and better dark spreads.

Current operating income totaled €291 million, representing a
decrease of 20.9% on an organic basis. This resulted from lower
EBITDA and higher provision balances, partially offset by a fall in
depreciation due to the decommissioning of the Teesside power plant.

(1) Sales of natural gas (including intra-group sales) came out 5.8 TWh lower at 71.4 TWh, as a result of fewer LNG cargoes.

6.1 MANAGEMENT REPORT

South Asia, Middle East & Africa

Revenues for the region totaled €580 million, up 7.3% on an organic
basis. This growth is mainly related to higher revenues from the
operating and maintenance (O&M) activities of new power plants in
Oman (Barka 3 and Sohar 2) and in Saudi Arabia (Riyadh IPP).

EBITDA came in at €181 million, down €43 million on a reported
basis, but representing an increase of €19 million or 12% on an

6.1.1.2.2 Energy Europe

organic basis. This reported decrease takes into account the change
in consolidation method for Al Hidd and Sohar 1 power plants, which
have been accounted for under the equity method since their partial
disposals in May 2012 and May 2013, respectively. The underlying
organic change is mainly related to increased O&M activities.

Current operating income totaled €173 million, an increase of
€37 million or 27.7% on an organic basis, reflecting improved EBITDA
as well as lower provisions.

The contribution of Energy Europe to Group revenues came in at
€43,479 million, down 2.1% year on year. Gas sales amounted to
684 TWh, including 126 TWh to key accounts. Electricity sales
amounted to 187 TWh. At end-December 2013, Energy Europe had
over 14.2 million individual customers for gas and almost 5.3 million
electricity customers.

The business line’s EBITDA for the period fell by 18.3% to
€3,415 million. The period was adversely impacted by a fall in selling
prices on the electricity market, outages at the Doel 3 and Tihange 2
nuclear power plants in Belgium until the beginning of June 2013"),
the end of free carbon allocations and by the sale of SPP (Slovakia)
in early 2013. Climatic conditions, the price “catch-up” adjustments
in France for 2011 and 2012 and performance efforts only partially
offset these impacts.

The 41.8% drop in current operating income reflects the decline in
EBITDA as well as net additions to provisions in the Central Western
Europe (CWE) region.

Central Western Europe (CWE)

The contribution of CWE to Group revenues amounted to
€36,355 million, edging up 1.5% year on year, as the strong
performance in France more than offset sluggish sales in Belgium.

CWE's EBITDA declined by 13.5 % on a reported basis, primarily
due to the overall fall in electricity market prices in Europe, the end of
free carbon allocations and lower margins on midstream gas, partially
offset by favorable climatic conditions, the gas price “catch-up”
adjustments in France and performance efforts.

The 36.4% drop in current operating income reflects the decline
in EBITDA and higher net additions to provisions chiefly on certain
contracts.

(1) The year-on-year impact of outages at the Doel 3 and Tihange 2 nuclear power plants in Belgium is slightly negative. These lasted 24 weeks at Doel 3
and 14 weeks at Tihange 2 in 2012 and continued through early June 2013 at both plants.

CWE France's contribution to Group revenues amounted to
€17,669 million for the year to December 31, 2013, up €486 million
compared to the previous period.

Natural gas sales declined by 7.7 TWh year on year and the more
favorable climatic conditions of 2013 could not completely offset the
impacts of customer losses and energy savings. GDF SUEZ still holds
around 83% of the retail market and around 51% of the business
market.

Electricity sales increased by 1.5 TWh thanks to higher sales to direct
customers and to the market as a result of the increase in electricity
production. This grew to 32.6 TWh (31.5 TWh in 2012) thanks to the

commissioning of new wind farms and an exceptionally high level of
hydropower in 2013, partly offset by a fall in production at gas-fired
power plants (unfavorable market conditions).

EBITDA grew by €348 million due mainly to the very favorable climatic
conditions in 2013 (positive impact on gas sales) and the gas price

accounts in Germany and the Netherlands.

EBITDA for Benelux & Germany fell back by 28% under the impact
of lower electricity prices and unfavorable spreads, the end of free
carbon allocations and a sluggish performance in Germany.

Current operating income declined by even more than EBITDA as a
result of higher net additions to provisions chiefly on certain contracts.

at the end of December 2012, down €253 million or 10.6% on a
reported basis. It dropped by €188 million on an organic basis, due
mainly to the decline in production in the Exploration - Production
business, notably due to outages carried out at the Snovhit and Njord
fields in the first and second halves of 2013, respectively.

Current operating income came in at €940 million for the year, down

Total revenues for the Infrastructures business line, including intra-
group services, amounted to €6,792 million in 2013, an increase of
9.3% on 2012. This was primarily driven by an increase in distribution
and transportation infrastructure access tariffs in an environment
marked by lower storage capacity sales in France and by colder
climatic conditions when compared to 2012.

Full-year 2013 revenue trends reflect:

» an increase in volumes distributed by GrDF due to colder climatic
conditions in 2013 than the previous year (up 24.0 TWh);

» the annual review of distribution infrastructure access tariffs (8.0%
increase on July 1, 2012, and 4.1% increase on July 1, 2013);

» the annual review of transport infrastructure access tariffs on April 1,
2012 (6% increase) and April 1, 2013 (8.3% increase).

6.1.1.2.5 Energy Services

In this climatic and regulatory context, the business line's contribution
to Group revenues in 2013 was €2,574 million, up 26.7% year on
year, reflecting:

> growth in transportation, storage and terminal services for third
parties against the backdrop of an increasingly deregulated market;

> higher gas purchase-sale transactions to maintain storage
performance.

EBITDA for the Infrastructures business line amounted to
€3,370 million for the period, up 10.5% compared to 2012.

All of the business line's activities contributed to the growth
performance, except for underground natural gas storage which was
held back by lower prices and smaller volumes.

Current operating income came in at €2,063 million, up 14.3%, with

Revenues for the Energy Services business line were stable year on
year at €14,707 million on a reported basis.

On an organic basis, they edged down 0.1% or €15 million, reflecting:

» a €24 million decrease in services activities in France, reflecting
the impact of the expiration of gas cogeneration contracts and the
slowdown in construction projects;

» a €26 million decline in installation activities in the Netherlands;

» a €53 million drop in installation and services activities in the UK,
Switzerland, Austria and Spain where market conditions remain
very tough;

» lower levels of Engineering business (down €9 million), reflecting
cuts in investment in the European energy sector.

These items were partially offset by:
> €31 million growth in installation activities in France;

> growth in installation activities in Belgium (up €23 million), albeit at
a lower rate than in 2012;

> brisk business in installation and services activities in Germany (up
€31 million);

> a €9 million rise in the heating networks activity in France, due
primarily to the positive impact of rate increases and cold climatic
conditions in the first six months of the year, and despite the
expiration of gas cogeneration contracts with CPCU.

6.1 MANAGEMENT REPORT

EBITDA for Energy Services grew 5.0% (€50 million) on a reported
basis to €1,068 million.

Organic growth came out at 3.8%, or €39 million, despite the following
adverse developments:

» the expiration of gas cogeneration contracts in France (negative
impact of €60 million);

» narrower margins, especially in engineering and local and regional
installation markets in France and Belgium;

> negative volume impacts, especially for installation activities in
Spain and the Netherlands.

These items were more than offset by:

> cold climatic conditions in France in the first quarter of 2013;

» cost-cutting measures — especially on overheads — and measures
to boost operating performance;

» the positive impact of the French tax credit to promote
competitiveness and employment (Crédit d’impét Compéti

» the positive impact of the commissioning of new heating networks
and services in France.

Current operating income amounted to €705 million, compared with

Income/(loss) from operating activites amounted to -€7,724
million, down on the end-2012 figure mainly due to the drop in current
operating income and the impact of impairment losses taken against
goodwill, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets.

GDF swez Registration Document 2013

At December 31, 2013, the Group recognized impairment losses
against goodwill for €5,775 million, and against property, plant and
equipment, and intangible assets for €9,103 million, chiefly concerning
the Energy Europe and Infrastructures business lines.


--- Page 12 ---

Financial statements

The impairment losses recognized against the Energy Europe
business line can be analyzed as follows:

» €4,438 million relating to goodwill (which consisted mainly of
€3,862 million on the Central Western Europe CGU (CWE),
€252 million on the Southern Europe CGU and €264 million on the
Eastern Europe CGU);

v

€5,670 million relating to property, plant and equipment, and
intangible assets (which consisted mainly of €3,765 million on
thermal power plants in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Luxemburg and France (CWE), and €1,013 million relating to power
generation assets in Italy, with the balance against other thermal
power generation assets in Europe.

These impairment losses are primarily attributable to though economic
conditions in Europe, which are durably affecting our midstream and
downstream margins and the profitability of our power generation
assets. While these assets were originally designed to be operated a
minima as mid merit power plants, they are now increasingly used as
backup capacities within the electricity system.

Impairment losses on the Infrastructures business line concern
underground natural gas storage activites for a total of €1,250 million
relating to goodwill, and storage facilities in France, Germany and the
UK for €1,896 million.

These impairment losses reflect the durable decline in the profitability
of the storage activities in the European market, which is notably due
to the decrease of the seasonal spreads levels.

In recognizing these impairment losses, GDF SUEZ has acknowledged
the major shift in Europe’s energy sector, in which entire asset
categories are moving towards new uses aimed at guaranteeing the
electricity and gas supply.

At December 31, 2012, the Group had recognized impairment losses
in an amount of €2,387 million, primarily relating to assets carried
on the books of GDF SUEZ Energy Europe and GDF SUEZ Energy
International.

Income/(loss) from operating activities was also affected by:

» changes in the fair value of commodity instruments that had
a negative impact of €225 million on income from operating
activities (reflecting the impact of transactions not eligible for
hedge accounting) compared with a positive impact of €105 million
at December 31, 2012. This was mainly due to a negative price
effect related to changes in the forward prices of the underlying
commodities over the period, coupled with the negative
impact of unwinding positions with a positive market value at
December 31, 2012;

v

restructuring costs of €288 million, compared with €263 million the
previous year;

v

“Changes in scope of consolidation” (gains and losses on the
disposal of consolidated equity interests or on remeasurement
of previously held interests in accordance with IFRS 3) which

6.1 MANAGEMENT REPORT

amounted to a negative €41 million at December 31, 2013,
compared with €110 million at December 31, 2012;

> “Other non-recurring items” for a positive €536 million (mainly
relating to the reversal of a provision for back-end of the nuclear fuel
cycle in Belgium), compared with €161 million for the year ended
December 31, 2012 (mainly corresponding to income relating
to the reduction of a penalty within the scope of the “MEGAL”
proceedings).

The Group reported a net financial income/(loss) of €1,754 million
for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared with an expense
of €2,341 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This
improvement was mainly the result of a positive interest rate impact
on net debt and the reversal of positive mark-to-market impacts at
the end of 2013 which were significantly negative at end-2012 (chiefly
as a result of the increase in the value of the embedded derivative in
International Power convertible US bonds following movements in the
share price in the wake of the Group's offer to buy the remaining 30%
of its share capital).

The effective recurring tax rate was 1.4 points higher than in 2012,
mainly as a result of:

> capping of the net deferred tax asset position in 2013 for certain tax
consolidation groups in Europe;

» the 3% tax on dividends payout by French companies;

> offset by recognition in the first-half of 2012 of one-off deferred tax
income, including €90 million on the Australian power generation
business following changes in tax legislation.

Income from associates was €33 million higher than in the year ended
December 31, 2012.

Net income attributable to non-controlling interests amounted to
€152 million, down on the previous year, as a result of the acquisition
of the 30% non-controlling interest in International Power and the
impact of impairment losses.

6.1.1.4. Changes in net debt

Net debt, which stood at €29.8 billion at year-end 2013, was
€6.8 billion lower than one year earlier and mainly reflected the
following items: (i) cash generated from operations before income
tax and working capital requirements of €13.3 billion less gross
investments for the period of €7.5 billion; (ii) dividends of €3.5 billion
paid to GDF SUEZ SA's shareholders; (iii) the cash received on the
issue of hybrid notes by GDF SUEZ in early July 2013 (€1.7 billion);
(iv) the impact of disposals carried out as part of the asset portfolio
optimization program, including the sale of SPP (Slovakia) and of 50%
of the Portuguese energy businesses; and (v) the reclassification of
certain French wind farms and the Group's stake in the Jirau dam as
assets held for sale.

6.1 MANAGEMENT REPORT

The following comments refer to the column entitled “Net change” in
the above table. The impacts of accounting for SUEZ Environnement
under the equity method are disclosed in Section 6.1.1.7 of this report.

The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets amounted to €72.3 billion, a decrease of €14.8
billion compared to December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily
the result of impairment losses (negative €9.1 billion impact),
depreciation and amortization (negative €5.9 billion impact), translation
adjustments (negative €3.1 billion impact) and the negative €3.3 billion
from reclassifying certain assets as held for sale, partly offset by the
positive impact of investments for the period totaling €7.2 billion.

Goodwill decreased by €6.1 billion to €20.7 billion, including
€5.8 billion relating to impairment losses recognized during the period.

Investments in associates amounted to €4.6 billion, up €0.3 billion,
mainly attributable to Energy International (SAMEA).

Total equity amounted to €53.5 billion, down €13.1 billion compared
to December 31, 2012, essentially reflecting the net loss for the period
(negative €8.9 billion), the payment of cash dividends to GDF SUEZ
SA‘s shareholders (negative €3.5 billion impact).

Provisions increased by €0.5 billion due to the combined impact of
net additions for the period, unwinding discounts on certain provisions
(positive €0.6 billion impact) and the release of surplus provisions
(negative €0.6 billion impact).

as an associate” and “intra-group and others” of the 2013 and 2012 income statement (see Section 6.1.1.7).

(2) The pro forma changes are obtained from the difference between the 2013 and 2012 income statements, adjusted for the impact of the SUEZ Environnement change.

(3) The pro forma percentage changes are obtained from the 2012 consolidated total, adjusted for the 2012 SUEZ Environnement change (see Section 6.1.1.7).

Consolidated revenues for the year totaled €89.3 billion. The difference
between this figure and 2012 revenues relates essentially to the loss
of control of SUEZ Environnement. The residual pro forma change
(negative 0.8%) is presented in Section 6.1.1.1 of this report.

The consolidated versus pro forma negative changes in EBITDA and
current operating income of €2.2 billion and €1.7 billion, respectively,
are attributable to:

» the loss of control of SUEZ Environnement (as for revenues);

» the pro forma decrease of 8.1% and 13.8%, respectively, detailed
in Section 6.1.1.1.

The impact of the loss of control of SUEZ Environnement on “income/
(loss) from operating activities”, “net financial income/(loss)”, “income

tax expense” and “share in net income of associates” is non material.

Changes relating to other items of the pro forma income statement

Directors’ Meeting of January 22, 2013, confirmed that the SUEZ
Environnement shareholders’ agreement would not be renewed and
would therefore expire on July 22, 2013 for all the parties concerned.

As a consequence of the end of the shareholders’ agreement,
GDF SUEZ ceased to exercise control over SUEZ Environnement
Company on July 22, 2013 and accounted for this entity under the
equity method as from this date (see Note 2.1).

In accordance with IAS 27 - Consolidated and Separate Financial
Statements, the residual interest in SUEZ Environnement Company is
recognized at fair value at the date control was relinquished.

GDF SUEZ SA, prepared in accordance with French GAAP and
applicable regulations.

on 2012 due mainly to more favorable weather conditions.

The Company posted a net operating loss of €676 million versus a net
operating loss of €267 million in 2012, chiefly reflecting net additions
to provisions for certain loss-making contracts.

The Company reported net financial income of €1,054 million,
compared with net financial income of €749 million one year
earlier. This mainly includes dividends received from subsidiaries for
€1,778 million compared to €1,734 million in 2012, the cost of debt
which remained stable at €843 million, and reversals of provisions
for interest rate risk for €167 million following the mark-to-market of

partially offset by net reversals of accelerated depreciation and
amortization (income of €112 million).

6.1 MANAGEMENT REPORT

6.1.2 Statutory Auditors’ report on the pro forma financial information related
to the year ended December 31, 2013

To the Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, and, to the Vice-Chairman
& President,

In our capacity as statutory auditors and in accordance with EU
Regulation N° 809/2004, we have prepared the present report on
the non audited pro forma financial information (“the Pro Forma
Information”) of GDF SUEZ for the year ended December 31,
2013 which is included in section 6.1.1.7 of the 2013 GDF SUEZ
Registration Document.

The pro forma financial information has been prepared, for illustrative
purposes only, to show the effect of the accounting of Suez
Environnement as an associate that has resulted in the loss of control
of Suez Environnement Company by GDF SUEZ as a consequence of
the termination of the shareholders’ agreement of Suez Environnement
Company on July 22, 2013. This Pro Forma Information shows the
impact on the consolidated statement of financial position, income
statement and statement of cash flows of GDF SUEZ at December
31, 2013 and at December 31, 2012, of the accounting of Suez
Environnement as an associate as from January 1, 2012. Because
of its nature, the Pro Forma Information addresses a hypothetical
situation and, therefore, does not necessarily represent the actual
financial position or results had the transaction or event occurred at
an earlier date than the actual or contemplated date.

In accordance with EU Regulation N° 809/2004 and the relevant
ESMA guidance, you are responsible for the preparation, on a
voluntary basis, of the Pro Forma Information.

It is our responsibility to express our conclusion, on the basis of
our work and in the terms required by EU Regulation N° 809/2004,

Appendix Il, item 7, on the proper compilation of the Pro Forma
Information.

We performed those procedures which we considered necessary
having regard to the professional guidance of the Compagnie
nationale des commissaires aux comptes (French Institute of
Statutory Auditors) for this type of engagement. Our work, which
does not include an examination of any of the underlying financial
information supporting the Pro Forma Information, consisted primarily
of verifying that the basis on which this Pro Forma Information was
prepared was consistent with the source documents, considering
the evidence supporting the pro forma adjustments and discussing
with the management of GDF SUEZ to gather the information and
explanations we deemed necessary.

In our opinion:

» the Pro Forma Information has been properly compiled on the basis
stated;

> this basis is consistent with the accounting policies of the issuer.

This report is intended for the sole purpose of filling the Registration
Document with the French Stock Exchange Regulatory Body (AMF),
and, where relevant, for the public offering in France and other
European Union countries in which a prospectus containing this
Registration Document, authorized by the AMF, would be published,
and may not be used for any other purpose.
