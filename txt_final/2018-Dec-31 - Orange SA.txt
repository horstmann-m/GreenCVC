1.1.2 History

Orange, formerly France Télécom, is France's incumbent
telecommunications operator. The Group has its origins in the Ministry
for Mail, Telegraphs and Telephone, later to become the General
Directorate of Telecommunications, which in 1990 was accorded the
status of independent public entity and, on January 1, 1991, renamed
France Télécom. On December 31, 1996, France Télécom became a
société anonyme (limited company). In October 1997, France Télécom
shares were listed on the Paris and New York stock exchanges,
allowing the French government the disposal of 25% of its shares to
the public and Group employees. Subsequently, the public sector
gradually reduced its holding to 53%. The law of December 31, 2003
authorized the transfer of the Company to the private sector and
between 2004 and 2008 the public sector sold a further 26% of the
capital, and then again 4% in 2014 and 2015. At December 31, 2018,
the French State retained 22.95% of the share capital, held either
directly or jointly with Bpifrance Participations.

France Télécom’s area of activity and its regulatory and competitive
environment have undergone significant changes since the 1990s. In
a context of increased deregulation and competition, between 1999
and 2002, the Group pursued a strategy of developing new services
and accelerated its international growth with a number of strategic
investments. These included, in particular, acquiring the mobile
operator Orange Plc and the Orange brand, which had been created
in 1994, and taking a controlling stake in Poland's incumbent operator,
Telekomunikacja Polska.

Since 2008, the Group has expanded strategically in Spain by acquiring
the mobile operator Amena, then in 2015 the fixed-line operator
Jazztel. Spain is the Group's second largest market, accounting for
nearly 13% of consolidated revenue in 2018.

In parallel, the Group streamlined its asset portfolio by selling off
non-strategic subsidiaries and holdings.

Over the last twelve years, the Group has pursued a policy of selective,
value-creating acquisitions by concentrating on the markets in which
it is already present.

Overview of the Group and of its business — 1

Overview

Mainly targeting the emerging markets of Africa and the Middle East
where the Group is historically present (in particular Cameroon, Cote
d'ivoire, Guinea, Jordan, Mali and Senegal), this strategy was
implemented through the acquisition of Mobinil in Egypt (2010) and of
Méditel in Morocco (2015) and more recently by the acquisition of a
number of African operators (in Liberia, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) (2016).

Italso resulted in the joint venture with Deutsche Telekom that combined
UK activities under the EE brand (2010) followed by the disposal of
EE in 2016, as well as the disposal of Orange Suisse (2012), Orange
Dominicana (2014), Orange Armenia (2015) and Telkom Kenya (2016).

As part of its Enterprise Services and since the acquisition of Equant
in 2000, Orange has been pursuing its strategy of becoming a global
player in digital transformation and has accelerated its shift to services
through a number of targeted acquisitions, notably in the fields of
cyber security and Cloud services, such as those of Business
& Decision and Basefarm in 2018.

Business diversification is one of the major pillars of the Orange group's
Essentials2020 strategy. The acquisition of Groupama Banque, now
Orange Bank, in 2016, which launched its new banking offer in
November 2017, illustrates the goal of diversifying into the mobile
financial services sector.

In 2006, Orange became the Group's main brand for Internet, television
and mobile telephony services in the majority of countries where it
operated, most importantly France and Spain. In 2013, the Company
adopted the Orange name, offering the full range of its telephony
services in France under the Orange brand. This policy continued with
the adoption of the Orange brand by Telekomunikacja Polska in 2013,
by Mobinil in Egypt, Mobistar in Belgium and Méditel in Morocco in
2016, and by several of the Group’s subsidiaries in Africa in 2017.
Enterprise services in the world are offered under the brand Orange
Business Services.

1.2.1 The global digital

services market

The digital services market is a subsector of the broader Information
and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. It combines IT services
and software, telecoms services, TV and video services, and Internet
services. On the other hand, it does not include network equipment")
and devices which are intermediate goods that automatically form part
of the added value. The digital services market is an essential
component of economic growth and accounts for significant value
creation via the distribution of new services and new uses.

With growth of 4.5% in 2018, the global digital services market amounts
to €3,383 billion and is continuing to grow steadily. The growth of this
market is driven by the dynamic Internet services sector (up 13.6% in
2018) and IT and digital content (up 5.6% each). Revenue from
telecoms services was € 1,187 billion. It experienced moderate growth
of 1.1% in 2018).

Market growth by region?

North America remains the top region in the world in the digital services
market with 37% of worldwide revenue, ahead of the Asia-Pacific
region at 29%, driven by its economic and industrial development.
Europe comes next with 24% of the market but is gradually weakening,
whereas Latin America (5%) and Africa (4.6%) account for 10% of the
worldwide market combined.

Digital services growth slowed in emerging markets owing to
constraints on purchasing power, competitive pressure and,
sometimes, the quality of service. The Asia-Pacific market suffered a
decline in demand in India and a substantial slowdown in China.
Growth in sub-Saharan Africa will likely not exceed 5%. While Africa
will account for 25% of the world’s population in 2050, compared with
17% in 2020, the potential of the Africa Middle East region, where the
Orange Group is very present, remains strong in both access
infrastructure and equipment. The digital ecosystem is currently being
built in the region. It is emerging and adapting to local conditions in
order to integrate IT in all areas of the economy (trade, agriculture,
government, mobile payments, etc.).

Market, strategy and business model

Key trends and changes in telecoms services

The development of very high-speed fixed broadband and mobile and
the high penetration of smartphones worldwide, lead to a growing
demand for bandwidth ®).

The return to growth of telecommunications services which began in
2017 remains weak in Europe. The weight of telecommunications
services is, therefore, trending downward in Europe due to strong
competition between operators and the development of OTT services.
The American market has also been in decline for the past two years,
but while it is of comparable size, it generates twice as much revenue,
traffic and investment. Lastly, growth in the rest of the world remains
steadier, although there is an observable slowdown in emerging
markets.

Convergence of services and market consolidation

Convergence, which provides a competitive advantage to operators
with both fixed and mobile network infrastructures, continues to grow,
particularly in Europe. It led to the development of so-called quadruple
play offers (voice, Internet, television, mobile), as well as the growing
use of WiFi in mobile networks.

The convergence of telecommunications and content operators is a
feature specific to the North American and UK markets. In the United
States, the acquisition by AT&T of the Time Warner media group,
owner of television chains HBO and CNN, announced in June 2018,
was approved by the competition authorities.

In Europe, the consolidation trend has slowed following mergers
between telecoms operators in 2014-2015 which addressed the need
for convergence and a reduction in the number of mobile operators.
However, the merger between mobile operators Tele2 and T-Mobile
in the Netherlands was approved by the European Commission at the
end of November 2018. With respect to fixed/mobile convergence
transactions, the merger of Vodafone and Liberty Global in Germany,
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Romania, which was announced in
May 2018, is underway. The merger of Tele2 and Telecom Hem in
Sweden was approved by the European Commission in October 2018.
In addition, in 2018, lliad and its founder took a majority stake in the
operator Eir in Ireland.

Network development and growth
in telecommunication uses worldwide

While in Africa and the Middle East, Internet access networks are
developing primarily via the deployment of mobile networks, in Europe,
investment in networks has focused on very high-speed broadband
access with the development of fixed-line fiber, 4G mobile network
performance improvements and the first 5G tests. Concurrently,
operators are upgrading their networks to make them more flexible
and simpler to manage (thanks to virtualization) and more open (thanks.
to APIs).

Usage is continuing to grow under the combined effect of the
deployment of new networks, the increase in capacity of existing
networks and growth in the penetration rate of smartphones. The
explosion in usage is mainly driven by the development of video and
Internet services accessible via a multitude of screens (computers,
smartphones, tablets, connected TVs, connected watches).
Furthermore, the development of long-distance radio network
technologies to connect low-consumption devices (LPWA) and 5G
will allow an increase in the number of connected devices which is
currently still quite low.

Consumer and company expectations

Digital technologies continue to gradually permeate all areas of daily
life: family, home, well-being, entertainment, work, and money. More
and more industries are being affected: domotics, the automotive
sector, health, financial services, energy and retail. The big Internet
players generate revenue through the monetization of data, collected
and analyzed thanks to Big Data and artificial intelligence techniques.

In this context, consumers have strong expectations on the quality
and reliability of the communication networks, but also on the protection
of their personal data and on having a trusted relationship with their
operator. In order to ensure the protection of citizens’ right to privacy,
in May 2018, the European Union implemented the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new legal framework to protect
personal data in Member States (see section 1.7 Regulation of telecom
activities).

The digitization of companies (loT, Big Data) improves their performance
and effectiveness through a better understanding and management
of customer relationships and of their internal processes. Furthermore,

1.2.2 The Orange group strategy
Launched in 2015, the strategic plan, Essentials2020, focuses on
Orange's ambition for 2020 to “provide its customers with an
unmatched customer experience” by being ever-present to “connect
every individual to what is essential to them”. This involves providing
exemplary basic services, quality and reliable access, customer
connections at any time and from anywhere they want, as well as even
more personalized options for services and offers.

The implementation of its Essentials2020 strategy has enabled Orange
to generate revenue and EBITDA growth again.

Orange serves every kind of customer: those who focus above all else
on price and those who have a particularly high-level of service
expectation, whether private individuals, very small companies or
multinationals. The Group can rely on a series of key strengths for the
mission that it has set out. With its brand and its 151,000 employees
at end-2018, it is present in Europe, Africa and the Middle East on the
residential market, and everywhere in the world on the Enterprise
market.

Orange's ambition breaks down into five main drivers:

1. offering enriched connectivity;

2. reinventing the customer relationship;

3. building a company model that is both digital and caring;
4. supporting the transformation of business customers;

5. diversifying by capitalizing on its assets.

Overview of the Group and of its business — 1
Market, strategy and business model

in the face of the increased threats of cyber-attacks, cyber-security
needs are increasing. Businesses therefore need to be assisted in this
double aspect of their transformation process.

Artificial Intelligence (Al) on the rise

Big Data, advances in algorithms and access to processing power at
very low cost, in addition to investments by American and Asian IT
giants, have accelerated the performance of artificial intelligence. Major
global players like Amazon and Google are positioned in the personal
assistant voice market which is still little developed in Europe.

The emergence of Al should substantially change consumer services
as well as processes within companies. Al opens up opportunities to
create new value-added services such as the development of chatbot
solutions (software robot that speaks to a user) in customer
relationships. It can substantially improve operational efficiency in
almost all major business lines: customer relationships, as well as IT,
marketing, support functions, etc.

Moreover, the strategic plan will be achieved within the framework of
a company that is digital, efficient and responsible.

Market, strategy and business model

1. Offering enriched connectivity

The multiplication of screens, the generalization of video on the Internet
and customers’ growing need for online services and content has led
toan explosion in usage and in mobile data traffic. Moreover, the digital
revolution has created new customer expectations and has changed
their behavior, making connectivity even more important. Offering an
efficient network to all customers is no longer enough; services must
now be tailored to each individual consumer and to each moment.
Orange would like to offer richer connectivity to all its customers,
whether retail or business.

In order to achieve its ambition, the Group invested € 7.4 billion in 2018
in line with the annual objective announced for 2018. Clear priority is
given to investments in very high-speed broadband, in order to respond
to the explosion in traffic and meet customer expectations. These will
allow Orange to develop broadband services, whether fixed or mobile,
as well as convergence services in Europe. Investments are being
made in particular in the following areas:

Development of very high-speed
fixed broadband and of convergence

Fiber To The Home (FFTH) is a source of value creation for Orange,
through the recovery of market share, customer loyalty and the
improvement of the average revenue per user (ARPU). At the end of
2018, very high-speed fixed broadband accounted for 6.3 million
customers and was up by 33% year-on-year.

The Group accelerated fiber deployment in 2018. At the end of 2018,
there were 32.5 million very high-speed broadband connectable
households (an increase of 5.9 million year-on-year, up by 22.4%),
including 13.8 million in Spain, 11.8 million in France and 6.4 million
in the rest of Europe.

Across Europe, the deployment of very high-speed fixed broadband
networks provides a competitive advantage over fixed-mobile
convergence where the Group is the leader with 10.9 million convergent
customers at end-2018, up by 5.5% year-on-year, including 6.1 million
in France, 3.1 million in Spain and 1.6 million elsewhere in Europe.

The Group's Love convergent offers are available everywhere in Europe.
Convergence also allows better service to be provided to business
customers.

Rollout of very high-speed
broadband mobile networks (4G and 4G+)

The development of very high-speed mobile broadband is continuing
in all regions in which the Group is present and Orange continues to
make significant investments in geographical coverage. Investments
in 4G and 4G+ mobile services continued to enjoy sustained growth
in 2018. The deployment of 4G sites accelerated in France, Spain and
in Africa and the Middle East, particularly in Mali, Morocco, Senegal
and Céte d'Ivoire. The impact of the Group’s investments in mobile
networks in France is reflected in the results of Arcep’s 2018 annual
survey which ranked Orange as number one in network quality for the
eighth consecutive year.

Continuation of network modernization

In anticipation of the future needs of its customers, the Group is
upgrading its networks to make them more agile and automatically
adaptable. Orange is thus continuing to drive the transition of its
networks towards all-IP, the Cloud and the virtualization of networking
functions, with the goal of being able to make them programmable in
real time and dynamically, based on the evolution of traffic and needs.
Orange has also begun using its expertise in artificial intelligence to
improve the operational effectiveness of its networks and of its
information system.

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

Orange is a world leader in the submarine cables market with a
450,000 kilometers network, i.e., 10 times the circumference of the
Earth (either wholly-owned or held through international consortiums).
The Internet and most international communications (over 99% of
traffic) use these submarine cables. In 2018, Orange contributed to
the deployment of the PEACE cable (Pakistan & East Africa Connecting
Europe). Itis 12,000 kilometers long and will connect Pakistan, Djibouti,
Kenya, Egypt and France and later South Africa. It will strengthen the
ties between the planet's three most-populated continents.

The Group is also preparing for the arrival of 5G: it is well-suited to
new mobile Internet uses and to the Internet of Things and will also
enable the emergence of new economic models. In 2018, Orange
carried out the first conclusive 5G technical tests in France and in
Europe. The Group will launch a pre-commercial phase in 2019 with
the deployment of a 5G network in 17 cities in Europe: in France (Lille,
Paris, Marseille and Nantes), Spain, Poland, Belgium, Luxembourg
and Romania.

The Group's ambitions for the future are to continue to lead in FTTH
and its future developments and to be leader in 5G. It also wants to
take advantage of new, related sales opportunities while continuing to
optimize the cost of the core networks and their CO, emissions.

For more information, see Sections 1.5.1 Orange’s networks and
1.6.1 Research and innovation.

An enriched content experience

The quality of the Group's networks, particularly in very high-speed
broadband, allows it to support the development of uses and respond
to customer demands by offering a multi-screen experience. The
development of uses is also based on access to quality content. In
this area, the Group's strategy involves strengthening its role as a
distributor by focusing on content aggregation able to choose, highlight,
package and offer attractive content meeting customer expectations
in a simple and fluid manner.

In a context of increased competition in 2018 resulting, in particular,
from the development and distribution of content via Internet (streamed
content services consumed on TV screens) which no longer requires
an operator TV decoder, Orange has continued its strategy of creating
value through content.

For more information, see Section 1.4.6.2 Content activities.

2. Reinventing the customer relationship

The relationship with the customer is a key success factor, thanks to
the direct link with the end-customer, especially when facing
competition from OTT platforms. The Group aims therefore to have
an impeccable relationship with its customers, thanks in particular to:

= the power of the Orange brand;

= the simplification of the customer journey by limiting the number of
steps and intermediaries;

= the improvement of the customer experience.

Brand identity

Orange has a strong brand, ranked 65th in the Top 100 BrandZ
ranking (source: Kantar Milwardbrown survey of the Top 100 Most
Valuable Global Brands in 2018). The Orange brand fell three places
compared to its 2017 ranking due to the strong growth of certain

An optimized customer journey

With the development of very high-speed broadband and the rapid
growth in smartphones offering customers autonomy, speed and
continuous availability, mobile services are becoming essential to the
customer relationship. The Group optimized its network of physical
sales locations and rethought their role with the use of the smartphone
which is increasingly becoming the key contact point, notably through
the My Orange customer app. It enables customers to manage their
Internet and mobile offerings from their smartphone, to contact Orange
easily and to resolve problems. It currently has 18.5 million active
users.

The physical stores now focus on more sophisticated customer
reception and advice tasks, and on the most complex transactions.
The concept is one of service excellence, provided in larger and more
welcoming stores that are organized by theme (home, family, work,
well-being and entertainment) and known as Smart Stores. Orange
had 883 Smart Stores at the end of 2018. The Group thus offers an
optimized customer journey combining Smart Stores and digital
channels through its self-care solutions such as “My Orange” or
e-commerce solutions.

The improvement of the customer experience

New customer relations management tools allow services to be better
targeted based on customer uses. The purpose of these tools is to
reconstruct the history of a customer's relationship with Orange,
regardless of their contact points, in order to better know the customer
and propose customized solutions that correspond to his or her needs.
and expectations. According to Les Echos’ e-CAC 40 study published
in October 2018, Orange is ranked 5th in digital maturity among large
French companies.

Orange is increasingly using its renowned expertise in artificial
intelligence. After integrating an artificial intelligence solution (IBM's
Watson) in its Mobile Banking offering, the Group announced that its
Djingo smart speaker will be available in Orange stores in the spring
of 2019. It will become the main interface for all Orange services.
For more information, see Section 1.6.1 Research and Innovation.

A trusted operator

As part of its offers, Orange already secures its customers’ identities
(Mobile Connect), health data (Orange Healthcare) and, for some
people, their money (Orange Bank, Orange Money). In addition to its
existing cyber-security and digital identity services, Orange intends to
become a trusted operator which secures and facilitates the digital
lives of its customers.

Unlike several Internet giants who highlight free access to their service,
the Orange business model is not based on using the personal data
of its customers but rather on a subscription (see Section 1.2.3
Business model). At the Show Hello event, Orange announced the
creation of an Ethics Committee on data use with customer and
employee representatives.

Orange deployed a broad-based project across the Group to prepare
for the entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), which took place in May 2018.

3. Building a company model
that is both digital and caring

Orange wants to be a company to which all its employees, women
and men, are proud to belong. In order to measure employee
satisfaction, which is a guarantee of business performance, Orange
introduced an employee satisfaction plan with a bi-annual survey in
France and an annual survey outside of France.

Overview of the Group and of its business — 1

Market, strategy and business model

The Group is continuing its internal transformation driven by the three
priorities of its promise to be a people-oriented and digital employer:

= relying on committed employees;

= developing collective agility by encouraging initiative and being
always more customer-focused;

= and securing the skills needed for the future by developing expertise
in-house and attracting new talent. The strong and rapid change in
business lines and skills is becoming a major societal challenge.

In December 2018, Orange confirmed its policy of being an ambitious
employer by signing a new inter-generational agreement for the
2019-2021 period based on three major themes: integrating young,
measures for senior employees and end-of-career management, and
the transmission of know-how, particularly between generations.

Orange has been committed to achieving gender equality in the
workplace for over ten years. It has focused on four main areas:
women’s access to positions of responsibility and to every management
level, balanced gender representation in all business areas including
technical fields, equal pay, and private life/work life balance.

Orange is involved in the environmental and energy transition. In
July 2018, it signed a new incentive agreement which, in particular,
introduced a Corporate Social Responsibility indicator for energy
management.

In order to develop the skills needed for the future, Orange
Cyberdefense joined forces with Microsoft and ECE Paris to train
future cyber-security experts at the heart of the digital transformation
of companies.

A recognized policy of human
resources development

In February 2019, for the fourth consecutive year, Orange received the
Top Employer Global 2019 world certification, which rewards the best
human resource policies and practices. Orange is one of the
14 employers in the world to be certified Top Employers Global 2019
and the only telecoms operator on the list.

On October 4, 2018, Orange also received the Top Employer Africa
2019 certification for the sixth consecutive year, placing it among the
three first Top Employers on the continent.

4. Supporting the transformation
of business customers

Carrying opportunity, efficiency, and growth, the digital revolution
deeply transforms the activities, organization, tools (customer and
employee relations) and the processes of businesses. In this context,
Orange is positioned as a trusted partner to support companies in
their digital transformation. To this end, the Group is attentive to the
needs and specifics of each of its customers’ industries, business lines
and processes, and security constraints, from SMEs to multinationals.
In addition to its traditional role as a supplier of connectivity wherever
it is present, the Group focuses on four key areas:

= providing digital work solutions to allow employees to become more
mobile, more connected and more collaborative;

= improving business line processes, particularly through applications
and connected objects, which provide companies with new
possibilities;

= providing multinationals with private and hybrid Cloud solutions;

= security solutions for the protection of all areas of companies’ vital
activities, which represent an increasingly important challenge today.

‘1 — Overview of the Group and of its business

Market, strategy and business model

In 2018, Orange Business Services pursued its strategy of becoming
a global player in digital transformation and accelerated its growth in
services. In addition, the diversification of its B2B activities continues
with the structurally important acquisitions of Enovacom (a leading
player in e-health), Business & Decision (an international consulting
and systems integration group) and Basefarm Holding (a major player
in infrastructure and management services of Cloud critical applications
in Europe).

For more information, see Section 1.4.5. Enterprise.

5. Diversifying by capitalizing on its assets

Orange concentrates on fields in which it can capitalize on its assets
and be a legitimate player in its customers’ eyes to develop new areas.
of growth: following on connected devices and mobile financial
services, cyber defense has become a major challenge for companies.
and governments.

Connected objects and mobile financial services have fundamentally
transformed customers’ daily life, and Orange believes it can provide
a real value-added service in these areas. These services require
enhanced connectivity and offer numerous synergies with the Group's
main assets: customer relationships, digital expertise, both physical
and digital distribution power, capacity for innovation, brand strength
(building confidence and trust with clients), networks and international
presence.

Cyber-defense is another field in which the Group has all of the assets.
needed to offer the solutions of the future to its customers. The Group
opened Orange Cyberdefense in Casablanca, Morocco in October 2018.
to create the cyber-security leader in French-speaking Africa.

Anew Group Executive Committee took office on May 2, 2018. The
fifteen-member team, both diversified and more international, is tasked
with ensuring the successful transformation of Orange into a
multi-services operator by capitalizing on the progress achieved
through the Essentials2020 plan, and notably through its voluntary
involvement in the deployment of very high-speed broadband networks
and improvement of the customer experience.

Connected objects

The Group wants to be present across the entire value chain of
connected devices: the distribution of connected devices, the supply
of related value-added services, and the management of data from
the connected devices, in particular using Datavenue, its open
intermediation platform.

Orange Business Services launched the LTE-M technology in
November 2018, dedicated to loT in France. It also initiated a developer
challenge to stimulate the LTE-M ecosystem. LTE-M technology is
already available in Belgium, was launched in Romania at the end of
2018 and will be released in Spain in 2019.

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

Mobile financial services

The growth prospects for mobile financial services are significant, not
only in Europe but also in Africa, where the mobile penetration rate is
much higher than the percentage of people with bank accounts in
most concerned countries, and where customers want to make an
increasing number of payments using mobile devices, in a simple and
fluid manner thanks to the dissemination of smartphones.

Orange's ambition in mobile financial services is to achieve the following
by 2023:

= 4 million Orange Bank customers and €500 million in net banking
income in Europe;

= over €800 million in revenue and over 30 million active Orange
Money customers in Africa and the Middle East.

For more information, see Section 1.3 Significant events.

A digital, efficient and responsible company

The Group wants to meet its objectives in respect of CSR performance
by being an ethical company, respectful of the ecosystem and the
environment in which it operates.

Corporate responsibility

In order to respond to the social and environmental challenges related
to the increasing number of devices (smartphones, tablets, connected
objects), as well as to the multiplication of energy-consuming uses,
Orange has committed to two priorities: to reduce its CO, emissions
per customer use by 50% by 2020 (compared to 2006), and to
promote the integration of circular economy principles within its
organization and its processes. At the end of 2018, CO, emissions
per customer use had been reduced by 56.6% since 2006. In
March 2018, Orange extended its solar energy access services to the
residents of rural areas in five new countries, confirming its intent to
become a key player in the energy transition in Africa.

For more information, see chapter 4 Non-financial performance.

For the 2018 Shareholders’ Meeting, Orange published its third
Integrated Annual Report showing shareholders and all its audiences
how its corporate project intends to create sustainable value shared
by all.

Operational effectiveness

Orange continues to improve its operational effectiveness through the
implementation of its Explore2020 program. Orange has achieved
gross savings of €3.5 billion since 2015, thus exceeding the €3 billion
of gross savings initially forecast for the 2015-2018 period.

Over the 2019-2020 period, Orange will continue its efforts using as
main drivers digitization, simplification and sharing to achieve additional
gross savings of one billion euros over this period.

Since 2018, the Group has also leveraged a Lean CAPEX program for
the gradual reduction of unit costs, which will result in savings of up
to one billion euros by the end of 2020. This will be partly reinvested,
in accordance with the Group's objectives.

Ambitions

Orange's strategy, in its core and new business areas, aims to generate
new growth while maintaining a healthy financial position. Concerning
operations, the Group tracks several major indicators allowing it to
assess the implementation of the Essentials2020 plan presented in
March 2015:

Two global summary indicators reflect the core ambition of Essentials2020
concerning Orange customers’ digital experience:

= aleadership indicator in terms of customer recommendations (the
Net Promoter Score or NPS), which encompasses all of the strategic
plan's drivers. Orange had set itself the goal of becoming number
1 in NPS among 75% of customers before 2018. It achieved very
positive results in 2017, with 68% ranking it number 1. In 2018
however, this score fell to 57% due to strong competitive pressure
onprices in several countries. The global target of 75% was therefore
not met. However, the Group does hold the top position in 15 out
of 23 countries", with anotably high score in France, where Orange
is number 1 in all segments 2);

an indicator which measures the power of the Orange brand: the
Brand Power Index. Orange's goal was to ensure ongoing improve-
ment of this indicator in all of its markets by 2018. In 2018, compared
with 2014, the Brand Power Index for fixed broadband and
convergence increased in 7 countries out of 10 and the Brand
Power Index for mobile increased in 15 countries out of 25.

Furthermore, Orange has one goal per driver:

= for the first driver on enhanced connectivity, Orange set itself the
objective of tripling the average data speeds of its customers on its
fixed and mobile networks by the end of 2018 compared with 2014.
At the end of 2018, compared with 2014, the average data speed

(1). The Indicator is not measured in Luxembourg or the Central African Republic.

Overview of the Group and of its business — 1

Market, strategy and business model

of the fixed network increased 7.6 times thanks to the deployment
of fiber and the average data speed of the mobile network increased
3.1 times;

= forthe second driver, on customer relationships, Orange was aiming
for 50% digitization of interactions with its customers in Europe by
2018. In 2018, 52% of Orange's customer interactions were via
digital channels;

= for the third driver on the digital and caring employer model, Orange
has chosen an indicator symmetrical to that chosen for its
customers, based on recommendation. In 2018, 81% of employees
recommended Orange as employer;

= for the fourth driver on the Enterprise market, Orange has chosen
to measure the success of the transformation of its Enterprise
business model towards IT services. The Group aims to raise the
share of IT and integration services in the Orange Business Services
revenue mix by 10 points by 2020. In 2018, revenue from IT and
integration services accounted for 36% of OBS revenue on a
like-for-like basis, i.e., an 8-point increase compared with 2014;

= finally, the selected indicator for the last driver measures the success
of diversification into new services, notably connected devices and
mobile financial services. The objective was for these new services
to contribute more than one billion euros to the Group's revenue in
2018. With 2018 revenue of €862 million, this objective was not
achieved given that the connected devices market grew less than
expected.

Financial objectives

As regards the financial component, see Sections 3.2.2 Outlook, and
6.3 Dividend distribution policy.

(2) In France, the indicator is measured in four segments: mobile, broadband, convergence and low-cost.

must also take into account the deep inequalities that characterise the
digital world. That is why Orange defines and implements innovation
in an inclusive and responsible way. The Group owes the success of
its strategy to the commitment of its 151,000 employees across the
world to whom it reiterates its digital and caring employer promise.

Creating value for all our stakeholders

The figure below presents the indicators that illustrate the financial and
non financial value Orange is creating for its stakeholders. Its large and
highly-skilled workforce is one of its greatest assets and Orange is a
leading employer in several countries. The result of an effective
innovation and investment policy, its industrial and intellectual capital
sets it apart from its competitors. The strength of its brand and the
extent of its distribution network also provide a competitive advantage.
Furthermore, excellent commercial performance across the Group,
combined with operational efficiency, have produced solid financial
results. With operations in 27 countries, Orange invests extensively in
networks and therefore plays an essential role in regional development
and people's daily lives. The Group maintains excellent relationships
with its suppliers and partners, promoting responsible and ethical
collaboration at every stage of the value chain. Moreover, the
commitments made and the actions taken with respect to carbon
footprint and circular economy demonstrate Orange's determination
to reduce its environmental impact.

Significant events

1.3. Significant events

In 2018, the Group continued to carry out its strategic plan,
Essentials2020, which relies primarily on the quality of the Group's
networks resulting from targeted capital investments, the depth of its
convergent and content products and the diversification into new
services, particularly mobile financial services and connected devices.
In the business segment, Orange Business Services made several
acquisitions in 2018 to supplement its business customer digital
transformation activities. The Group also continues to implement its
operational efficiency and cost-control programs (with Explore2020)
and investment programs (with Lean CAPEX).

In March 2018, Stéphane Richard, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of Orange, announced a renewed Group Executive Committee,
with a new, more diversified and international team of 15 members
whose mission is to lead the transformation of Orange into a multi-
services operator by capitalizing on the progress achieved through
Essentials2020. The new Executive Committee started work on May 2,
2018 (see Section 5.1 Composition of management and supervisory
bodies).

Investment in networks

In 2018, the investments in networks (besides telecommunication
licenses) accounted for 62% of the Group's CAPEX. In particular, the
installation of networks providing broadband and very high-speed
broadband Internet access is one of the five levers of the Essentials2020
strategic plan. In France, Orange invested 9 billion euros in the
installation of networks between 2015 and 2018, 3 billion euros of
which was on fiber optics.

Very high-speed fixed broadband networks

The Group is continuing the accelerated deployment of its very high-
speed fixed broadband networks with 5.9 million new households
connectable year-on-year. At December 31, 2018, Orange had
32.5 million very high-speed broadband connectable households
throughout the world (up 22.4% year-on-year), including 13.8 million
in Spain, 11.8 million in France and 6.4 million in the rest of Europe.
In France, out of 11.8 million households and commercial premises in
the available market for fiber at the end of 2018, Orange built 9.3 million
fiber connections, using only equity capital. Orange has installed 69%
of the fiber optic network in France (source: Arcep) and in 2018 signed
six new agreements for operating the fiber optic networks of regional
authorities (Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, Gironde, Vienne-Deux
Sévres, Orne and Var, plus a submarine cable in Guadeloupe, see
below). Orange particularly made progress with installations in the less
populated areas, with an increase of 40% in 2018 compared with
2017. In addition, in May 2018, Orange entered into commitments
with the French government regarding the deployment of fiber optics
inits «AMIl» areas (areas covered by calls for expressions of investment
intentions) (see Note 14.1 to the consolidated annual financial
statements).

In April 2018, Orange also announced a commercial agreement with
Eutelsat aiming to improve its satellite-based, very high-speed
broadband Internet access services in the European countries where
it operates in the retail market. This agreement will allow the Group to
offer high quality access to digital services to all of its European
customers, including in rural areas where it is sometimes difficult to
introduce traditional very high-speed broadband networks.

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

Modernization of the fixed-line telephony network
in France

In France, Orange has been gradually replacing the Public Switched
Telephone Network (PSTN) technology installed in the 1970s in order
to preserve fixed-line telephony service for years to come. IP (Internet
Protocol) based technology, now an international communications
standard, is already used by nearly 11 million Orange customers in
France. It will gradually replace the old STN technology at Orange for
all of its fixed-line telephony customers. Since November 15, 2018,
Orange has only been marketing fixed-line telephony in metropolitan
France using IP.

Very high-speed broadband mobile networks
(4G/4G+/5G)

In 2018, Orange continued installing its 4G/4G+ networks. In France
and in Spain, the investments made are mainly aimed at increasing
the density of coverage outside of urban areas and at improving
speeds in the major cities. At December 31, 2018, 4G coverage rates
reached 98.6% of the population in France, 96.9% in Spain and 99.8%
in Poland. In France, Orange will have converted nearly all of its 3G
sites into 4G by the end of 2019. In addition, Orange’s 4G+ is already
installed in dozens of cities to meet the growing usage needs of
customers. In Africa and the Middle East, deployments are continuing,
particularly in Mali, Morocco and Senegal. With these investments,
Orange has 56.2 million 4G customers across the world at
December 31, 2018 (an increase of 21.7% year-on-year), including
15 million in France, 9.8 million in Spain, 14.8 million in Europe and
16.7 million in Africa & Middle East (excluding associates and joint
ventures).

In addition, against a background of strong growth in mobile Internet
traffic, the Group is actively preparing for the arrival of 5G technology
and has, in particular, decided to carry out new large-scale trials in
Europe, as a joint development with its technology and innovation
partners. 5G promises a higher-performance network, with speeds up
to 10 times faster than 4G and an altogether new network for the
Internet of Things, able to connect objects on a massive scale. In
countries where there is very little fiber optic infrastructure, 5G will also
be an alternative for accessing very high-speed. In 2018, Orange
conducted the first conclusive technical experiments of 5G in France
and in Europe. Rolled out at the existing 4G sites, 5G will be installed
in 17 cities in Europe in 2019 and be ready for commercialization
starting in 2020, when a sufficient number of 5G smartphones will be
available.

Orange ranked no. 1 mobile network in France

For the eighth consecutive time, Orange confirmed its ranking as the
number one mobile network in France according to the results of the
annual survey of the quality of service of mobile operators in mainland
France published by Arcep (Autorité de Régulation des
Communications Electroniques et des Postes) in October 2018.
Overall, Orange was first or tied for first on 181 of the 193 criteria
measured.

This survey also bears out the Group's continued efforts on mobile
coverage for rural areas in France, by this year again ranking Orange
in first place or tied for first place for voice services in communities
with less than 10,000 residents. In January 2018, Orange and the
other French mobile operators signed an agreement (called the «New
Deal») with the French government, under the aegis of Arcep, on
access by the French population to broadband in the whole country.
The extension until 2031 of authorizations to use the 900 MHz,


--- Page 14 ---

1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz frequencies expiring in 2021 will take place
without an increase in fees or financial auctions, in exchange for
increased coverage obligations for operators from 2018. In this
connection, Orange has agreed along with the other French mobile
operators to cover at least 5,000 new areas throughout the nation.

Submarine cables

Through new partnerships, Orange has strengthened its position in
the submarine cable market. The Group's goal is to raise the quality
of the services it offers on its global network, while optimizing costs,
so as to handle the ever increasing volume of data exchanges.

In May 2018, Orange International Carriers announced the entry into
service of a new land cable between Marseilles and Penmarch (two.
major geographic locations for submarine cables), which interconnects
15 submarine cables and thus improves connectivity between Asia,
the Middle East and West Africa. In September 2018, Orange
announced the improvement of its connectivity on the coast of West
Africa due to its investment in the MainOne submarine cable. In
October 2018, Orange also announced a partnership with Google as
part of the Dunant Project, the first submarine cable to connect the
United States and France in over 15 years. The 6,600 kilometer cable
is set to go into service in late 2020. In addition, Orange and PCCW
Global announced in October 2018 their partnership agreement to lay
the new PEACE submarine cable (Pakistan & East Africa Connecting
Europe). This cable, 12,000 kilometers long, is to connect Pakistan,
Djibouti, Kenya, Egypt and France and should be operational in 2020.
Finally, in January 2019, Orange inaugurated the Kanawa cable that
connects French Guiana, Martinique and Guadeloupe. This cable,
1,750 kilometers long, was financed by Orange's equity capital.

The multi-services and enhanced
services strategy

Content, mobile financial services and connected devices are major
areas of diversification for the Group, one of the five levers of its
Essentials2020 strategic plan and a component of the broader strategy
of developing enhanced services.

Mobile financial services
(Orange Bank — Orange Money)

At the end of November 2018, Orange made known its goal of
expanding in mobile financial services.

In terms of Europe, the Group's goal is to roll out its mobile financial
services in seven European countries by 2023 through its Orange
Bank services (in France, Spain, Poland, Belgium and Slovakia) and
enhanced services through its Orange Money service (in Romania and
Moldova). The Group aims to have 4 million customers by that date.
Orange Bank was launched in November 2017 in metropolitan France
and had served 248,000 customers as of December 31, 2018. In
March 2018, Orange Bank enhanced its line of banking products with
a personal loans offering. In October 2018, its banking products were
launched in the French overseas departments.

With respect to Africa and the Middle East, the Group's goal is to
extend Orange Money into 19 countries and aims to have more than
30 million active customers in 2023. Launched in 2008, Orange Money
today has 39 million customers, including 15 million who use the
service every month, in 15 countries in Africa and the Middle East
(excluding associates and joint ventures). Another of the Group's goals
is to launch, with partners, additional banking services (credit, saving
and insurance products) in four African nations (Cte d'Ivoire, Senegal,
Mali and Burkina Faso) through the launch of Orange Bank Africa,
assuming the necessary authorizations can be obtained. Moreover,
Orange and MTN, two of the largest mobile money operators on the
African continent, announced in November 2018 the creation of
Mowali, ajoint operation that will enable interoperable mobile payments
throughout the continent.

Content

Orange's content strategy will give priority to the broadest possible
distribution of the best content offerings on the market, and to invest
in movies and series via Orange Studio and OCS. It has been confirmed
through a series of new agreements signed in 2018:

= in January and March 2018 respectively, Orange renewed
distribution agreements with the M6 Group and TF1 Group channels
as well as non-linear services associated with these channels.

These agreements allow Orange TV customers to enjoy enhanced
services and features for the two groups’ programming. At
December 31, 2018, Orange had 9.6 million IPTV and satellite TV
customers (of which 7.0 million customers in France), a 6.1% increase
year-on-year;

= in 2018, Orange extended its agreement with organizations in the
film industry to invest in French and European movie productions
via OCS, committing 125 million euros over the next three years
(2019-2021);

= in April 2018, Orange and Fnac Darty announced the strengthening
of their digital reading strategic partnership with the launch of anew
audiobook offering, promoting the dissemination of new methods
of digital reading. Following on from the «ePresse» (digital press)
and «izneo by Fnac» (digital comics) services launched at the
beginning of October 2017, since May 2018 Orange customers
have been able to access 100,000 audiobooks and 3 million e-

Internet of Things (loT)

To support the explosion of the Internet of Things (loT) market, Orange
Business Services announced in November 2018 the introduction of
LTE-M technology (Long-Term Evolution for Machines) in France. This
is the first technology dedicated to connected devices on a mobile
network in France. Installed on the Orange 4G network, this technology
facilitates exchanges of enriched data (Data, Voice, Messaging) with
devices that are in motion, in buildings or underground locations, and
also is needed for logistical tracking, telesurveillance and medical
remote assistance, and vehicle fleet management. At year-end 2018,
over 98% of the population was covered. Starting in 2019, international
roaming and other new features specific to LTE-M technology will be
available.

This end-to-end technology supplements the existing loT dedicated
network products such as LoRa®, which remains the network of
choice for connecting devices with very low energy consumption. The
LoRa® (Long Range) network now covers over 30,000 towns and
cities and 95% of the population of metropolitan France.

In April 2018, Orange Business Services also announced the launch,
in France and in Europe, of the Datavenue Market web portal, putting
the suppliers of connected devices in contact with companies or
developers wishing to test and validate an loT project, ina completely
independent manner and at lower cost.

Lastly, Orange and Groupama announced in January 2019 their
agreement to create a joint company called Protectline, operating in
the property telesurveillance space. This company will be 51% owned
by Orange and 49% by Groupama. Orange will introduce its property
telesurveillance products for fixed and mobile retail customers in
France in the spring of 2019.

Digital transformation
of business customers

As part of the Essentials2020 strategic plan, Orange is positioning
itself as a partner of companies in their digital transformation. To that
end, Orange has added to its activities through acquisitions and
creating a joint company.

Following the takeover in June 2018 and additional acquisitions in
second half of 2018, Orange acquired 88.2% of the capital of Business
& Decision, a company specializing in data and digital technology,
operating in business intelligence (structured analysis of business
data) and customer relationship management (CRM), for a total amount
of 36 million euros, net of the cash acquired. In addition, Orange
benefits from mutually-binding options on the remaining 4.9% of the
capital (see Note 3.2 to the consolidated annual financial statements).

In August 2018, Orange also acquired 100% of Baseform Holding, a
European company active in infrastructure, Cloud services, the
management of critical applications and data analysis, for a total of
230 million euros net of the cash acquired (see Note 3.2 to the
consolidated annual financial statements). Henceforth, with
2,200 employees expert in the Cloud, more than half of whom work
outside France, Orange Business Services plans to generate over half
of its revenue in the Cloud internationally and is aiming at annual
growth of 25% through 2022.

In February 2018, Orange also acquired Enovacom, which operates
in the e-health sector. This acquisition forms part of the strategy of
Orange Healthcare, its healthcare subsidiary, to be the leading partner
in the digital transformation of health organizations and stakeholders
in France and internationally.

Lastly, in February 2019, Orange announced the acquisition of the
SecureData group and its subsidiary SensePost. SecureData is the
largest independent provider of cyber security services in the United
Kingdom, which is the largest market in Europe (see Note 17 to the
consolidated annual financial statements).

Orange, a people-oriented
and digital employer

Building a people-oriented and digital employer model by securing the
skills needed for tomorrow, developing collective agility, and fostering
individual commitment is one of the priorities of the Essentials2020
strategic plan.

In December 2018, Orange signed a new intergenerational agreement
with three French trade unions, covering the integration of young
people, assistance with and preparation for retirement and knowledge
transfer. This agreement, effective January 1, 2019, covers the years
2019, 2020 and 2021. Under this agreement, Orange has agreed that

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

the Group in France will host an average of 4,000 young people on
work-study and 2,400 interns at all times. Once they are trained, the
Group further agrees to hire at least 2,000 from work-study or
internships on permanent contracts. Lastly, Orange has given a three-
year extension to the French «Part-Time for Seniors» plan of 2015,
allowing employees to tailor their schedules during the three years
preceding their retirement. The estimated number of beneficiaries of
the extension of this plan is 6,000 employees (see Note 6 to the
consolidated annual financial statements).

In June and December 2018, Orange announced that it had, in the
context of its share Buyback program, acquired 6.9 million treasury
shares for the amount of 101 million euros (see Note 13.2 to the
consolidated annual financial statements). Those purchases were
made in order to fulfill obligations related to (i) the «Orange Vision
2020» free share award plan covering 9.1 million shares and (ii) the
plan for performance share awards as part of executives’ multi-year
variable compensation (Long Term Incentive Plan, LTIP 2018 - 2020).
These plans were established with the objective of involving all Group
employees and executives (subject to continued employment and
performance conditions) in the success of the Essentials2020 strategic
plan (see Note 6.3 to the consolidated annual financial statements).

Furthermore, in December 2018, Orange announced the payment of
an extraordinary «solidarity bonus» for 20,000 of the lowest-income
employees as a commitment to the issue of people's purchasing power.

Operational effectiveness
(Explore2020)

In 2018, Orange continued its operational effectiveness (Explore2020)
program. The objective, which was reviewed in December 2017, was.
to exceed the 3 billion euros of gross savings initially projected for
2015-2018, thereby contributing to controlling the expected increase
in operating expenses.

Onan aggregate basis for fiscal years 2015 to 2018, the objective was
reached, with 3.5 billion euros of gross savings over the period
(953 million euros in 2015, 758 million euros in 2016, 934 million euros
in 2017 and 893 million euros in 2018), thus surpassing the original
goal by 18%. In 2018, this amount related to both operating expenses
included in the adjusted EBITDA calculation, of 681 million euros, and
in CAPEX, of 211 million euros.

Over the 2019-2020 period, Orange will continue its efforts on costs
using as the main drivers digitization, simplification and sharing to
achieve additional gross savings of one billion euros over the period
2019-2020. On investments, Orange will rely on Lean CAPEX, a
program with the goal of gradually reducing unit costs by 15%, resulting
in one billion euros in gross savings in 2020 (which will be partially
reinvested in line with the Group's objectives).

operators with a wide range of services including fixed telephony and
mobile telecommunications, data transmission and other value-added
services, including mobile financial services. The Group operates in
27 countries (including two in which it holds a minority interest). The
Group's business is presented in this section under the following
segments: France, Spain, Europe, Africa & Middle East, Enterprise,
International Carriers & Shared Services, Orange Bank (see Section 3.3.1
Note 1 Segment information).

Operating activities

1.4.1 France

Orange is France's incumbent telecommunications operator (see
Section 1.1 Overview). The bulk of its business is carried by Orange
SA, which is also the parent company of the Orange group.

The France operating segment includes all fixed and mobile
communication services to consumers and companies with less than
50 employees") in France®!, as well as services for carriers. Activities
developed for companies with more than 50 employees, as well as
content activities and those of Orange Bank are covered respectively
in Sections 1.4.5, 1.4.6.2 and 1.4.7 of this document.

In 2018, the France operating segment generated 42.6% of the Group's
consolidated revenue.

The market

At September 30, 2018, the revenue of French telecommunications
operators declined by 1.1% on a sliding 12-month basis (source:
Arcep, 3rd quarter 2018). While fixed narrowband telephony revenue
continued its downward trend as a result of the steady decline in the
number of lines, fixed broadband revenue continued its growth due
to the increasing number of accesses. Despite intense competition,
mobile services revenue rose driven by a sustained growth in access
numbers.

The French broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet
market is dominated by four main operators that account for over 99%
of broadband customers. With a 40.3% market share, down 0.1 point
compared with end-2017, Orange is the market leader on this market
ahead of Free, Altice-SFR and Bouygues Telecom (nos. 2, 3 and 4,
respectively, in number of customers). °

The French mobile market is dominated by the same four operators.
as the fixed market, which account for 89% of mobile customers
(excluding M2M). With a market share of 32.5% in 2018 compared
with 32.9% in 2017, Orange also remains the leader in this market
ahead of its competitors Altice-SFR, Free Mobile and Bouygues
Telecom (respectively nos. 2, 3 and 4 in number of mobile customers
excluding M2M) and all of the MVNOs.°)

Orange’s business activities

Orange France's core business involves the provision of fixed-line,
broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet and mobile
telephony services for the Retail and Pro-SME markets. This strategy
is underpinned by convergence, very high-speed fixed and mobile
broadband and the Group’s “unmatched” customer experience (see
Section 1.2.2 The Orange group strategy).

In the Retail mobile market, Orange has segmented its offers into four
main categories: 2h 100 MB or 2h 5 GB for customers looking for

Operating activities

The results of Orange’s activities in 2018 and its principal operating
indicators in its various business segments are detailed in Section 3.1
Analysis of the Group's financial position and earnings.

Unless otherwise indicated, the market shares indicated in this chapter
correspond to market shares in terms of volume, and the data related
to customers does not include SIM cards dedicated to connected
objects (Machine to Machine).

basic communication and Internet connectivity; 10 GB which offers a
combination of enhanced Internet connectivity and increased communi-
cation possibilities; 50 GB adapted to meet the needs of heavier
Internet users; and 100 GB and 150 GB for customers wanting the
best smartphones and who have extremely intense connectivity needs
both in France and abroad.

Orange is present in all market segments, including the entry-level
market, with four types of mobile contract marketed under the Sosh
brand at affordable prices that are available only on the Internet, with
no commitment and no handset. At the end of December 2018, Sosh
had 3.8 million mobile clients.

Since 2015, Orange has only marketed 4G offers, including entry-level
packages.

Orange pressed ahead with its family-based strategy through its
flagship Open offer with the development of multi-line contracts. Open
mobile offers are available in the same ranges as traditional mobile
offers and include the same levels of service.

The strategy of segmenting offers on the Retail and Pro-SME markets
allows Orange to continue to grow its subscriber base while the decline
in prepaid offers continues.

At the same time, the MVNO customer base hosted on Orange's
network has remained stable on a sliding 12-month basis.

In the Retail broadband Internet market, Orange has segmented its
offers into two main categories: Livebox designed for customers
looking for basic Internet and TV services, and Livebox Up which
meets the needs of customers who want the highest speeds and a
premium TV experience. Regarding equipment, in October 2018
Orange launched a new HDTV decoder.

Sosh has also been present on the broadband Internet market since
the end of August 2018, with affordable offers, available exclusively
online and without commitment.

Orange's and Sosh’s broadband Internet access offers are marketed
with FTTH technology in eligible areas, or alternatively, with ADSL.
Orange is the leader in terms of FTTH access sold, with a portfolio of
nearly 2.6 million subscribers at the end of 2018.

Since the telecommunications market was opened to competition,
Orange has been the operator responsible for part of the universal
provision of services. These include a minimal set of basic services
available to all citizens who request them, including connection to a
fixed network open to the public, and the provision of quality telephone
service at an affordable rate. See section 1.7.1.2.3 Regulation of
fixed-line telephony, broadband and very high-speed broadband
Internet.

Operating activities

Furthermore, Orange offers services to carriers, an activity which
includes the interconnection of competing operators, as well as
unbundling and wholesale services (ADSL and fiber optic), regulated
by Arcep, and construction and marketing services for very high-speed
fiber optic networks. Unbundling services saw a decrease in their price
regulated by Arcep on January 1, 2018.

With the steady growth in full unbundling, as well as the wholesale of
ADSL contracts and naked ADSL access to third-party Internet service
providers, the decline in revenue generated by the traditional telephony
service business continues.

Orange is also pursuing advertising activities via its websites, which
are available in multi-screen web, mobile and tablet format with more
than 27 million unique visitors per month. The most frequently visited
French website on a daily basis, Orange.fr ranks 6th behind Google,
Facebook, YouTube, Amazon and Wikipedia, with 8.8 million unique
visitors per day. On mobile screens, Orange attracts 16.8 million
mobile users as well as 4.1 million tablet users each month (source:
Médiamétrie and Médiamétrie//NetRatings —- Audience Internet
Global - November 2018).

Against a backdrop of fierce competition and market restructuring,
Orange has also continued to innovate, notably with the continuous
development of mobile financial services (see Section 1.4.7 Orange
Bank).

Distribution

Orange is pressing ahead with its digital development strategy with a
100% digital customer experience in Orange online stores (available
on Orange.fr) and Sosh (via Sosh.fr), with Sosh offers available only
on the digital channel. In 2018, the latter accounted for 26.4% of sales
actions, up 5.5 points year-on-year. Digital technologies can address
the growing needs of customers for autonomy and immediacy.
Orange's contract management app My Orange, attracted 5.0 million
unique visitors in December 2018.

The dedicated customer centers, based on the type of services
marketed, accounted for 19.2% of sales actions, a decline of 1.4 point
year-on-year. The development of the digital channel is thus continuing
to relieve the pressure on call centers and reduces the use of
outsourcing.

The network of retail stores spread across France continues to roll out
the Smart Store concept launched in 2015. At end-2018, this network,
which consisted of 394 stores owned by Orange (including
16 Megastores and 180 Smart Stores), and 201 Générale de Téléphone

1.4.2 Spain

The Group has been present in Spain since the liberalization of the
Telecom market in 1998. Initially present in the fixed-line telephony
market, it acquired the mobile telephony operator Amena in 2005, and
then adopted the Orange brand in 2006. The acquisition of the Jazztel
fixed-line operator in 2015 enabled Orange to consolidate its position
in terms of convergence thanks to Jazztel’s fiber coverage. The Group
has also strengthened its presence in the low-cost market with the
acquisitions of MVNO Simyo in 2012 and Republica Movil in 2018,
thereby consolidating its multi-brand strategy designed to cover all
segments of the market.

In 2018, Orange generated 12.8% of its consolidated revenue in
Spain, making it the second most important market for the Group.

2) Metropolitan France, Overseas Departments and Overseas Territories.

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

Stores (including 78 Smart Stores), accounted for 50.4% of sales
actions, down 2.7 points year-on-year.

Lastly, the other channels, which include direct marketing, door-to-door
and the multi-operator network, accounted for 4% of sales actions, a
decline of 1.3 point year-on-year.

The Network

Orange's commercial leadership is partly based on its leadership in
fixed and mobile networks.

In the fixed network, Orange continued to step up its very high-speed
broadband program in 2018 with the installation of 2.7 million FTTH
connections in one year (compared with 2.2 million in 2017), setting
anew record in France. 69% of fiber optic installations were deployed
by Orange in 2018 (source: Arcep, 3rd quarter 2018). At end-2018,
Orange had 11.8 million FTTH-connections.

Actions to improve the fixed network speed with a view to significantly
improving the Internet experience of households and professional
customers in rural areas continued, with fiber deployment in town
centers (subscriber connection node opticalization, fiber to
sub-distribution frames), and participation in FTTH Public Initiative
Networks (PIN) of local and regional authorities. Orange has enjoyed
considerable success regarding its expertise in PIN deployment. Six
new agreements relating to the operation of the fiber optic networks
of local authorities (Bourgogne - Franche-Comté, Gironde,
Vienne — Deux-Sévres, Orne and Var, as well as a submarine cable in
Guadeloupe) were signed in 2018.

As regards the mobile network, 2018 saw the continued deployment
of 4G reaching a coverage rate of 98.6% of the French population (up
2,7 points compared with end-2017), whichis still the best 4G coverage
rate in France". At the end of 2018, Orange had deployed 19,053 4G
sites in France®! (source: ANFr, January 1, 2019).

This deployment involves the continued extension of coverage in
tourist areas, stadiums, trains (LGV and TER), subways and the
motorway network.

For the eighth consecutive year, the Orange mobile network was
ranked no. 1 by Arcep in 2018 (source: Arcep, October 2018).

As regards the cluster, transmission, and transport network, Orange
carried on with (i) the simplification of fixed-line broadband access
engineering (vDSL and FTTH) to accommodate the high growth in
traffic, and (ii) works aimed at the transition from traditional telephony
services to IP telephony.

The market

Since the beginning of market consolidation in 2014, four operators
have dominated the telecoms market: Telefonica, the incumbent
operator, which operates under the Movistar brand and which acquired
D+ in 2014; Orange; Vodafone which acquired ONO in 2014; and
MasMovil Ibercom, initially an MVNO, which acquired Yoigo in 2016
and then signed a commercial agreement to access Orange's fixed
and mobile networks.

Together, the four convergent operators control more than 90% of the
market, with Telefonica ranked first, followed by Orange, whose market
share in 2018 reached 26.7% on broadband Internet and 25.8% on
mobile, then Vodafone").

In addition to competing on the B2B and B2C segments through their
main brands, these four operators also compete via other brands in
the low-cost market: Orange with Jazztel, Amena, Simyo and
Republica Movil; Telefonica with Tuenti and 02; Vodafone with Lowi;
and MasMovil with Pepephone.

Orange’s activities in Spain

Orange is pursuing a multi-brand commercial strategy in Spain
comprising a focus on convergent offers, the deployment of
next-generation networks and prioritizing innovation in its services and
business lines (X by Orange, wholesale, etc.). Its operating strategy
combines the potential of its 4G and FTTH networks. In 2018, this
strategy continued to be supported by the increased number of TV
customers and the growing trend for convergence in the customer
base.

Inthe mobile market, Orange has developed a wide range of 4G offers,
both for convergent customers and for mobile-only customers.
Orange's strategy focuses on providing value-for-money, very
high-quality services, including for low-cost offers, to meet the needs
of all customer segments. In 2018, Orange improved its offerings to
meet the growing demands of its customers for data and services.

Orange also offers quality, high definition and multi-device TV contents.
In 2018, Orange significantly developed its TV platform, both at the
technical level and in terms of content, by enhancing its offer through
broadcasting soccer matches and other premium content, which
allowed it to reach a TV penetration rate of more than 17%". Since
August 2018, Orange has, with Movistar, been the only operator to
offer its customers the entire soccer content available in Spain.

Orange is also a key player in the low-cost market with mobile-only
and convergent offers available online under the brands Amena, Simyo.
and Reputiblica Movil.

On the fixed broadband market, Orange continued to be the leader in
FTTH customer base growth.

1.4.3

Outside France and Spain, the Group is present in six countries in
Europe, where it is implementing its convergence strategy through the
deployment of very high-speed fixed and mobile broadband, and the
launch of new offers. In 2018, Orange launched its Love convergence
offers in all European countries. In each country, Orange develops its
convergence strategy taking into account the local context and
leveraging the strengths of its subsidiaries:

Europe

= in Poland where the Group is the incumbent operator, leader in fixed
and number two in mobile;

in Belgium and Luxembourg, where the Group launched its
convergence offers via partnerships;

and in other countries in Central Europe (Romania, Slovakia and
Moldova) where the Group, leader in mobile, is a convergent player
via the deployment of fiber optic, the use of 4G for the development
of fixed via LTE, and its partnerships.

1.4.3.1 Poland

The Group has been present in Poland since 2000, the year it acquired
an interest in the incumbent operator, Telekomunikacja Polska
(renamed Orange Polska). In 2006, Orange became the single brand
for mobile activities in accordance with the Group's brand policy. In
2012, it also became the single brand for all fixed-line telephony
services offered by the Group in Poland. Orange owns 50.67% of the
shares of Orange Polska, which is listed on the Warsaw Stock
Exchange. In 2018, the Group generated 6.2% of its consolidated
revenue in Poland.

Poland has four main mobile telephony operators: Orange, T-Mobile
(owned by Deutsche Telekom), Polkomtel (operating under the Plus
brand, owned by the Cyfrowy Polsat Pay-TV by satellite group) and
P4 (operating under the Play brand, controlled by Tollerton Investments

Operating activities

On the B2B market, Orange launched X by Orange in 2018 to enable
small offices and home offices (Sohos) and Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs) to have access to high-end digital services. As a
digital partner for large companies, Orange has developed cutting-edge
technologies such as Big Data, the Internet of Things and cyber
security services, enabling its key account clients to improve their
operational efficiency and competitive position.

With the objective of differentiating itself from other operators, Orange
launched several innovative solutions in 2018 such as Smart WiFi,
which ensures an optimal wireless signal at home for its customers,
and WiFi with me, which allows customers to access the Internet
wherever they are. Orange was also the only operator in Spain to offer
Google Home Assistant and was granted exclusivity for the launch of
the Pixel 3 smartphone.

Orange has also innovated in the equipment market, offering the best
smartphones, tablets, video game consoles and Smart TVs ina bundle
with offers tailored to meet the needs of each customer.

The Network

Orange continued to deploy its FTTH network, with 1.9 million new
connectable households in 2018. In 2018, Orange was able to offer
very high-speed broadband connections to 13.8 million households
through its own fiber optic network and thanks to the network sharing
agreement signed with Vodafone and MasMovil.

Orange is also pursuing the roll out of its 4G network which, in 2018,
covered 96.9% of the population". Regarding 5G, Orange has
launched a national testing program to develop real 5G usage scenarios
and demonstrate the benefits of this technology to improve the
customer experience.

Ltd and Novator Telecom Poland SARL). At the end of 2018, these
four mobile telephony operators accounted for 98% of the total number
of SIM cards in Poland, with Orange ranking second after Play with a
market share of 27.9% at end-December 2018".

In the broadband Internet market, Orange is the leading operator with
a market share of 28.4% in the third quarter of 2018". Its principal
competitors are cable TV operators (mainly UPC Polska, Vectra and
Multimedia Polska), as well as Netia, a traditional telecommunications
operator. The telecommunications market is undergoing consolidation
with Netia being acquired by the Cyfrowy Polsat group, followed by
Vectra’s announcement in August 2018 of its acquisition of Multimedia
Polska. While these developments underscore the validity of Orange's
convergent strategy in Poland, they are likely to boost competition.

Orange’s at ies in Poland

Orange's main strategic objective in Poland is to be the leader in
convergence, by marketing packaged offers of fixed and mobile
broadband access with financial incentives. Convergence enables
Orange to differentiate itself from its competitors and gain a larger
share of the household media and telecommunications budget and is
an effective retention tool. In 2018, Orange pursued this strategy by
focusing on its convergent offer, Love, which exceeded one million
customers in October 2018. The basic formula of the Love package
includes fixed and mobile services at an affordable price. This package
can be extended for higher fixed broadband speed, additional SIM
cards, additional TV contents and other value-added services.

Orange focuses on a differentiated approach in large cities and medium
and small towns, as well as rural areas, by taking into account the
local competitive environment, the potential in relation to population
density, and customer needs. In large cities, Orange focuses on
developing the FTTH coverage and improving its fixed broadband

market share, by leveraging its excellent positioning in the mobile
market via the cross-selling of fixed and mobile telephony services.
Mobile technologies in rural areas remain the first solution for broadband
access.

The number of fixed voice lines continued to decline in 2018, with a
net loss of voice customers (traditional PSTN or VoIP) due to structural
demographic factors, as well as the growing appeal of mobile telephony
services offering unlimited calls across all networks.

As announced in September 2017, Orange Polska continued to
implement its new strategic plan Orange.one in 2018. This plan is
designed to create long-term value and sets forth the strategic vision
of the company by 2020.

In July 2018, Orange and T-Mobile forged a partnership giving access
to Orange's fiber optic network to some T-Mobile customers in
non-regulated areas. This 10-year partnership will maximize the use
of the Orange fiber optic network and contribute toward a more rapid
monetization of this investment.

The Network

In 2018, Orange pursued the deployment of its FTTH network in
Poland, extending it to almost 3.4 million connectable households.
vDSL coverage stood at 5.3 million households and has not changed
significantly since 2017 because of the priority given to the fiber network.

LTE services (4G) are offered by Orange via 10,882 base stations.
To meet the strong growth in 4G traffic, Orange focused on spectrum
refarming in 2018 to increase the allocation made to 4G, by lowering
allocations to 2G and 3G technologies. Orange also focused on
increasing the number of sites allowing spectrum aggregation. At
end-2018, Orange's 4G network covered 99.8% of the population".

1.4.3.2

In Belgium and Luxembourg, Orange operates via Orange Belgium
(previously Mobistar) and its subsidiary Orange Communications
Luxembourg. Orange Belgium is listed on the Brussels Stock
Exchange. The Orange group holds 52.9% of the capital. Historically
present in the mobile segment in Belgium, in 2016 Orange launched
convergent offers across the entire country, based on the regulation
of wholesale access to cable, and then adopted the Orange brand
the same year. In 2018, Orange Belgium generated 3.0% of the
Group's consolidated revenue.

Belgium & Luxembourg

Belgium

The competitive structure of the fixed-line telephony market remained
relatively stable in 2018, with the predominance of the incumbent
operator Proximus and the regional cable operators Telenet and VOO.
Telenet acquired SFR Belux in 2017 and bought the cable network of
Etterbeek, a municipality of Brussels, in December 2018.

On the mobile telephony market, Orange's competitors are two major
mobile telephony operators: Proximus (the incumbent operator, 53.5%
owned by the Belgian State) and Telenet (56.4% owned by the Liberty
Global group), which acquired Base in 2016. With a market share in
volume of 27.1% in the third quarter of 2018, Orange ranks third in
terms of customer base, but is still second in value terms behind
Proximus".

In 2018, Orange pursued its convergence strategy, notably by adding
to its Love convergent offers a TV function on the Orange TV mobile
app, anda fixed phone option. With its Love Internet and TV package,
Orange is the first operator in Belgium to market a nationwide cable
offer. The success of this high quality fixed offer at an affordable price
has enabled it to sharply increase its customer base.

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

At the same time, Orange Belgium stands out as a “bold challenger”
on the mobile market with the launch of the first completely unlimited
offer (data, calls and SMS) on the market.

Investment in mobile networks remained high with the steady
deployment of 4G, mainly to expand coverage within homes, and to
invest in the core transmission network, as well as the steady
deployment of 4G+, which provides customers with a more rapid
download speed that is up to three times faster. Orange's 4G network
covers 99.7% of the population". In addition, Orange Belgium is the
first Belgian telecommunications operator to team up with Fluvius, the
electricity and gas distribution operator, in a joint fiber optic pilot
project, which is in line with the future ultra-fast network objectives of
the Flemish Government. Orange was also the first operator to launch
end-to-end mobile loT services.

Luxembourg

Orange started its operations in Luxembourg in 2007 via the acquisition
of Voxmobile. The company adopted the Orange brand in 2009.

On the mobile segment, Orange Communications Luxembourg is
ranked third behind Post Luxembourg, the market leader and
incumbent operator, and Proximus Luxembourg, a subsidiary of the
Belgian operator Proximus with its own brand, Tango (source: ILR for
the year 2017). Post Luxembourg also has the largest market share
in the fixed-line and Internet market.

In 2018, the Luxembourg market remained strongly oriented towards
convergence.

In 2018, Orange continued to enjoy the success of its convergent offer,
Love, which it completed with the launch of a high-speed fiber optic
offer which now goes up to 1 Gbit/s, and its Home Box fixed LTE offer.

1.4.3.3 Central European countries

Romania

Orange Romania was founded in 1997 and adopted the Orange brand
in 2002. Historically present on the mobile segment, Orange launched
its satellite TV offers in 2013, then its fiber offer in 2016, following a
wholesale agreement with Telekom. In 2018, the Group generated
2.7% of its consolidated revenue in Romania.

The Romanian Telecom market is dominated by four operators:
Orange, Vodafone, Telekom (the incumbent fixed telephony operator,
also present on the mobile segment, jointly owned by the Romanian
government and OTE, which is itself jointly controlled by Deutsche
Telekom and the Greek government) and RCS&RDS (operating under
the Digi brand, owned by Digi Communications).

In the mobile telephony market, Orange's market share was 34.1% in
2018, compared with 34.8% in 2017. Orange maintained its leading
position, followed by Vodafone, Telekom and Digi".

Following the recent launch of its fixed offers, Orange's market share
in the fixed-line market increased by 1.8 point, but remains limited at
5.6%, in a market dominated by Digi, followed by the incumbent
operator Telekom and UPC").

Orange’s activities in Romania

Orange continued to increase its 4G presence, which is the largest in
Romania and now covers 96.9% of the population throughout the
country as a whole, and 100% in urban areas"). Orange continued to
integrate more data into its offerings, enabling the rapid adoption of
smartphones and significant growth in traffic and in revenue from data
services. Orange has thus strengthened its leadership position in the
4G segment by maintaining its level of contracts which represent 52%
of its customer base. In 2018, Orange improved its Love convergent
offers and revamped its post-paid portfolio by focusing on three pillars:


--- Page 20 ---

convergence, simplicity and increased data. In September 2018,
Orange acquired the rights to the Champions League and Europa
League and launched HBO Go for Orange Home TV, in support of
convergence.

In 2018, the National Bank of Romania approved the request of
Orange Mobile Financial Services for a payment institution license. In
July 2018, Orange Mobile Financial Services added new features to
its e-wallet offer, in particular the option of having an IBAN account, a
first in Romania. At the end of 2018, Orange signed a strategic
partnership with VISA to provide Romanians with innovative payment
solutions.

Orange is still the leader in terms of innovation thanks to numerous.
initiatives carried out in 2018, such as the first 5G test in real operating
conditions in Cluj, which was carried out as part of Orange Group's
5G program. The initiatives also included a network coverage map
and the launch of the Alex chatbot in June. This chatbot is unique in
the Romanian market in that it can give personalized answers to
customers’ questions through advanced features that enable it to
understand natural language.

Slovakia

Orange Slovensko started operating in 1996 and adopted the Orange
brand in 2002. Historically present on the mobile segment, Orange
reinforced its position in the area of convergence thanks to a new fiber
deployment program in 2016 and the launch of fixed-line solutions via
LTE in 2017. In 2018, the Group generated 1.3% of its consolidated
revenue in Slovakia.

The fixed broadband market in Slovakia is dominated by the incumbent
operator Slovak Telekom, whose infrastructure covers the whole country.
Orange, which rolled out its own fiber optic network in Slovakia and
markets DSL Internet services via a commercial agreement with Slovak
Telekom, is ranked second in this market with a market share of 139%".

In the mobile telephony market, Orange competes with three other
operators: O2 (owned by the O2 Czech Republic group), Slovak
Telekom (owned by Deutsche Telekom) and Swan (national operator).
The Slovak post and Swan started to offer mobile services in
October 2015, only in prepaid formulas, available in all post offices.
Although its market share declined by 1.5 point year-on-year, from
40.8% to 39.3%, Orange remains the market leader. Slovak Telecom
is ranked second in value terms, followed closely by 02.

1.4.4 Africa and Middle East

The Orange group is present in 19 countries in Africa and the Middle
East of which 17 where it has controlling interests and two where it
has minority interests. Part of the activities of the operating segment
in Africa is structured into sub-groups (Sonatel and Céte d'Ivoire). In
Africa and the Middle East, Orange primarily operates in the mobile
markets, with the exception of countries where the Group controls the
incumbent operator (Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire and Jordan) and Morocco,
where it also provides telephony and fixed Internet services. In 2018,
Africa and the Middle East accounted for 12% of the Group's
consolidated revenue.

1.4.4.1 Sonatel sub-group

The Sonatel sub-group, in which the Orange group has been present
since 1997, operates under the Orange brand in the five countries
where it is present. Senegal and Mali account for 76% of its business
and Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone for the rest. The Sonatel
sub-group has developed gradually, firstly by launching operations in
Mali as of 2003, then in the Republic of Guinea and Guinea-Bissau in
2007, and then by acquiring Airtel Sierra Leone in 2016. In 2018,
it generated 3.7% of the Group's revenue.

Operating activities

Orange’s activities in Slovakia

In 2018, Orange continued to execute its long-term strategy focused
on strengthening its position on the convergent market. This is
supported by its solid market share in mobile telephony and by the
launch in August of a television service that is enhanced with exclusive
content, including Champions League soccer matches, as well as
premium HBO movie channels.

Orange continued to expand its 4G network in 2018. It also focused
on extending its fixed broadband coverage by increasing its FTTH
coverage (which amounted to 0.5 million connectable households at
the end of 2018) and launching a satellite TV network.

Orange markets a number of innovative offers, particularly its
convergent offer Love. At the same time, Orange has simplified its
portfolios of mobile and fixed-line contracts and launched its new
flexible Smart Packages contracts for Funfon prepaid customers.

Moldova

Orange Moldova started operating in 1998 and adopted the Orange
brand in 2007. Historically present on the mobile segment, Orange
launched its fixed and convergent telephony offers in 2017, following
the acquisition in 2016 of SUN Communications, Moldova's main
cable operator. In 2018, the Group generated 0.3% of its consolidated
revenue in Moldova.

The main telecommunications operators active in Moldova are
Moldtelecom (the fixed telephony incumbent operator, also present in
the mobile segment under the Unite brand), Orange and Moldcell. In
2018, Orange maintained its position as the number one in the mobile
telephony market, followed by Moldcell and Unite".

Orange’s activities in Moldova

In 2018, Orange focused on growth in its fixed-line business and
convergence offers, in response to the growing demand for data in
fixed-price contracts, as well as the acquisition of new customers and
the management of its customer base. The offer portfolio and processes
have been streamlined to improve efficiency and customer experience.

The mobile markets in which the Sonate! sub-group operates are
mainly prepaid markets, largely driven by the rapid development of
voice and data usage. These countries are currently experiencing
tighter regulations, notably with increased controls on promotions,
resulting in the forced suspension of certain offers, particularly in
Senegal. At the same time, the different regulators are imposing
increasingly strict requirements as to quality of service and compliance
with environmental standards. The development of the Sonatel
sub-group’s markets continues to be affected by high tax levels.

In 2018, growth in the fixed market was based on the Flybox, TDD-LTE
(fixed Internet on 4G) and fiber optic offers.

With respective mobile market shares of 53.1% in Senegal, 59.0% in
Guinea (sources: local regulator, 3rd quarter 2018) and 56.9% in Mali
(source: GSMA), the Sonatel sub-group is leader in all of its markets
with the exception of Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone where it is the
second largest operator with respective market shares of 47.6% and
31.0% (source: GSMA). Depending on the country, it has two or three
competitors: Tigo and Expresso (Sudatel group) in Senegal;
Sotelma/Malitel (Maroc Telecom group) and Alpha Telecom (the

Planor-Monaco Telecom International consortium) in Mali; MTN and
Cellcom in Guinea; MTN in Guinea-Bissau; Sierratel (the incumbent
operator), Africell and QCell (new entrant) in Sierra Leone.

By promoting the development of digital inclusion through its
multi-service networks, the Sonatel sub-group contributes to economic
and social development in all its operating countries in specific areas:
community well-being, good governance, growth and development
and protection of the environment.

In 2018, the Sonatel sub-group pursued its growth strategy by focusing
‘on the following areas:

command of broadband: with the commercial launch of fiber optic
and 4G+ in Senegal and Mali and TDD-LTE in Mali;

expansion to include new sources of growth with the market launch
of the Orange Energie solar energy service contracts in Senegal,
Mali and Guinea;

continuing to open new corridors for voice traffic in the sub-region
and internationally;

stepping up the development of Orange Money which promotes
financial inclusion in the sub-region, with a new leadership role in
Senegal in national money transfers.

With 4G networks already operating in Senegal, Mali and
Guinea-Bissau (the first Sonate! sub-group operating country to launch
4G in 2015), Sonatel continued major works to modernize and extend
its mobile network.

1.4.4.2

The Céte d'Ivoire sub-group, in which the Orange group has been
present through Orange Céte d'Ivoire since 1996, operates under the
Orange brand in three countries. Céte d'Ivoire accounts for 71% of its
business and the remainder is split between Burkina Faso and Liberia.
The Céte d'Ivoire sub-group expanded through the acquisition of
Cellcom Liberia in April 2016 and Airtel Burkina Faso in June 2016. It
operates in a geographical region with a population of more than
48 million inhabitants. In 2018, it generated 2.6% of the Group's
revenue.

Céte d’lvoire sub-group

There were opposing trends in the Céte d'Ivoire sub-group’s markets.
in 2018 against the backdrop of the launch of the mobile roaming
charges harmonization project in ECOWAS Member States, the
continued growth of mobile financial services and relative tensions
with the regulatory authorities on audits of compliance with mobile
license specification requirements (Céte d'Ivoire and Burkina).

In Céte d'Ivoire, 2018 was marked, in particular, by stricter mobile
customer identification requirements, resulting ina drop in the market's
mobile customer base, the reconsideration of price differentiation
between on-net and off-net calls and the regulator's heightened
vigilance regarding quality of service and coverage level. In 2018,
mobile number portability was also implemented in the country.

With mobile market shares of 41% in Céte d'Ivoire (source: Artci,
3rd quarter 2018), 43.3% in Burkina Faso (source: Orange estimates)
and 60.5% in Liberia (source: GSMA), the Céte d'Ivoire sub-group is
now ranked first in all of the countries where it operates. In Céte
d'Ivoire, the sub-group is also the leader in the fixed telecommunications
market and in mobile financial services.

The three entities have the following competitors in each of their
regions: MTN and Moov in Céte dIvoire; Onatel and Telecel in Burkina
Faso; MTN in Liberia.

In 2018, the activity of the sub-group was marked by the significant
growth in revenue of Orange Burkina but also by the fire that broke
out on April 30, 2018 in an Orange technical center in Abidjan which
affected revenue growth.

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

In 2018, the Céte d'Ivoire sub-group continued its development
strategy based on the following areas:

= modernization and extension of its mobile networks, notably 4G, in
particular to meet requirements for mobile data;

= optimization of energy costs (solar panels, optimization of energy
consumption);

innovation with regard to uses and offers to speed up the
development of mobile data;

= promotion of fixed Internet with the development of FTTH in Céte
d'ivoire (more than 8,500 active customers for around
34,000 available connections at the end of 2018) accompanied by
content offers and the purchase of an TDD-LTE license (4G fixed
Internet) in Liberia;

extension of services eligible for Orange Money (payment of invoices,
international transfers, etc.);

= development of the B2B business, in particular through a
differentiated and integrated approach for offers targeting SMEs;

= distribution of integrated solar kits to provide electricity to Orange
customers with no access to the electricity grid;

= strengthening of international connectivity.
1.4.4.3 Countries of North Africa
and the Middle East

Egypt

The Orange group entered the Egyptian Telecom market in 1998
through a partnership with Orascom and Motorola in the operator
Mobinil. It gradually increased its stake following the withdrawal of
Motorola in 2000 and Orascom in 2015. Since 2016, all services are
marketed under the Orange brand. In 2018, Orange Egypt delisted
from the Cairo Stock Exchange. In 2018, the Group generated 1.6%
of its consolidated revenue in Egypt.

The buoyancy of the market was driven by the launch of 4G services
by all operators in the final quarter of 2017 and the simultaneous
increase of 30% in the price of prepaid recharges following the
regulator's decision. At the same time, Telecom Egypt, the incumbent
operator until then present only in the fixed-line market, launched a
new mobile operator under the brand WE, operating under a roaming
agreement with Etisalat.

With a mobile market share of 31.7% (Source: GSMA), Orange remains
number two on the market, behind Vodafone and ahead of Etisalat.

Among the highlights for 2018, Orange notably:

= launched new mobile Internet offerings contributing to the
development of data usage;

= expanded the coverage of its 4G service launched in
September 2017 with a focus on Greater Cairo, Alexandria and the
Nile Delta region;

= pursued the digitization of customer relations thanks to the success
of the My Orange app and the partnership with Jumia to market
mobile and 4G offers online.

Within the context of the 4G launch, Orange continued to modernize
its access network in 2018 to support the growth in data usage, and
notably replaced its old Alcatel Lucent equipment to enhance the
capacity and quality of its network.

Morocco

The Orange group entered the Moroccan Telecom market in 2010
through a partnership with Médi Telecom. The company, which was.
operating under the Méditel brand, became a consolidated subsidiary
of the Group in July 2015 after Orange increased its interest to 49%
of the capital. Since end-2016, all services are marketed under the
Orange brand. In 2018, the Group generated 1.3% of its consolidated
revenue in Morocco.

With 33.1% of the mobile market (source: ANRT, 3rd quarter 2018),
Orange is the second largest mobile operator in the country (behind
the incumbent operator, Maroc Telecom, and ahead of Wana).

In 2018, Orange maintained its sales momentum on the back of:
= the revamping of its portfolio of residential and B2B offers;

= the launch of very high-speed fixed broadband offerings (fiber optic
and TDD-LTE) for the Retail and B2B markets;

= simplifying the customer journey and digitizing the customer
relationship;

increasing the penetration rate of smartphones and data users and
converting customers to 4G;

= reinforcing its distribution channel and developing the penetration
and use of My Orange and E-Care B2B apps.

Orange was the first operator to launch 4G services in Morocco in
April 2015, and in 2018 continued to develop its network to support
the increase in data traffic. This involved the densification of its 4G
network, boosting the capacity of the Core Data network and extending
the national and international terrestrial transmission network.

2018 was also marked by measures taken to step up the
implementation of the Group's fixed strategy for both B2C and B2B
customers. This strategy is notably based on a new fixed telephony
ecosystem that encompasses several partners across the entire value
chain. At the end of 2018, the Orange Maroc fiber optic network had
around 7,500 customers.

Jordan

The Orange group entered the Jordanian Telecom market in 2000
through a partnership with the incumbent operator Jordan Telecom.
The company became a consolidated subsidiary of the Group in 2006
after Orange increased its interest to 51% of the capital. Since
end-2007, all services are marketed under the Orange brand. In 2018,
the Group generated 0.9% of its consolidated revenue in Jordan.

Orange is the country's second largest mobile operator, behind Zain
and ahead of Umniah. In the third quarter of 2016 (the date of the last
publication by the Jordanian regulator), its market share of the mobile
segment was 32.4%.

Overview of the Group and of its business — 1

Operating activities

Orange is also present in the fixed-line market through its ADSL
Internet offers as well as FTTH, launched in 2016. In this segment, its
competitors are Zain and Umniah, which use Wimax and TDD-LTE
technologies, as well as fiber in the case of Zain.

In 2018, Orange pressed ahead with its development strategy with
the following focus areas:

= the revamping ofits portfolio of mobile offers, in particular to address
the youth market;

= the exclusive development of very high-speed Internet and mobile
4G+ offers and fixed offers with the massive deployment of fiber in
the capital and some large cities;

= reinforcement of international outgoing traffic with an increase in the
number of corridor offers, in particular for Egypt;

= support for large B2B accounts.

Orange is continuing to contribute to the country’s digital transformation
by supporting start-ups in its accelerator program, by helping women
learn to code (Orange Digital Centers), by accompanying its B2B
customers (especially with its Datacenter), and via a highly ambitious
internal digital transformation plan that includes the launch of chatbots
(for in-house purposes as well as for its customers) and the first use
of robots.

Tunisia

Orange Tunisie launched its activity in May 2010 after acquiring its
license in July 2009. The Orange group is a partner with 49% of
the capital.

Orange’s mobile market share was 26.6%, up slightly on 2017, placing
itin third position behind Ooredoo, which maintains its leading position,
and Tunisie Telecom. Orange also confirmed its leadership in the
segments of 3G and 4G keys with a market share of 51% (source:
Instance Nationale des Télécommunications, 3rd quarter of 2018).

In 2018, Orange Tunisie created momentum for its B2B business
which succeeded in winning several major accounts on the Tunisian
market and recorded revenue growth of almost 14% compared with
2017.

Orange Tunisie also improved its performance in the mobile and data
markets with the launch of several innovative offers, together with the
Best Retail Network program and by strengthening its presence on
digital platforms.

In terms of the network, Orange Tunisie continued to work on the
extension and densification of 4G coverage by refarming certain
frequency bands. In addition, Orange Tunisie was ranked “Best Mobile
Data Operator in Tunisia” in 2017 following the survey conducted for
the first time by Nperf in Tunisia.

2018 was marked by strong momentum driven by the sales teams,
as well as the attractiveness of the offers, in a stable economic climate
(after the sharp devaluation from mid-2016 to mid-2017). This made
it possible to break through the symbolic 10 million customer barrier
in the second half of 2018 (source: GSMA).

Furthermore, in 2018, the upgrading of the old Orange and Tigo
networks was completed, enabling Orange to offer extensive 3G
coverage and to differentiate itself from competing operators. 4G was
launched in the three major cities (Kinshasa, Goma and Lubumbashi).

“International Incoming Traffic Termination Tax” (TATTIE), despite its
adverse effects on traffic volumes.

In 2018, Orange Niger opened IRT corridors (international money transfer
via Orange Money) with other Orange subsidiaries in the sub-region
and with Benin thanks to an agreement signed with MTN Benin.
Orange Niger also continued its strategy to modernize and improve
its 2G/3G mobile network.

The main operational achievements in 2018 relate to the upgrading of
mobile data offers and the densification of the Orange Money
distribution network. Orange also continued to extend its radio
coverage throughout the country (19 cities covered by 3G, making
Orange Centrafrique a key player in the provinces), boost international
satellite capacity and modernize the B2B access network.

Mauritius

The Orange group has been present in Mauritius since 2000 through
apartnership with the incumbent operator Mauritius Telecom, in which
it holds 40% of the capital.

Mauritius Telecom is the leader in Internet and fixed-line Telecom
services in Mauritius, ahead of DCL, and in mobile services ahead of
Emtel and MTML (source: GSMA).

The operator offers a comprehensive range of fixed and mobile data
and voice services. It also offers convergence packages (voice, IP and
TV) through its MyT service. The first operator to launch 4G and mobile
payment services in 2012, Mauritius Telecom launched its fiber optic
network (FTTH) in 2013.

The main growth drivers for Mauritius Telecom lie in content, in particular
with a strategy of investing in premium content, enabling Mauritius
Telecom to strengthen its position as the market leader.

The company also offers international connectivity via fiber optic
submarine cables.

Enterprise

The market

The B2B market for communication services and IT services is part of
the wider ICT market, which combines the technologies used in the
processing and transmission of information. In 2018, it accounted for
just over 1.2 trillion euros (1.4 trillion dollars) worldwide (source: Gartner,
3rd quarter 2018), up 3% on a constant currency basis. The value of
this market by region breaks down as follows: North America for 39%,
Asia Pacific for 26% and Europe for 24%. The markets for consulting
and integration services and for managed services and Cloud
infrastructure services grew in 2018 and respectively accounted for
29% and 28% of the world market in value terms (source: Gartner,
3rd quarter 2018).

The B2B telecommunication services market is shared by many
players, notably telecommunications operators, network integrators,
managed IT service providers, and Internet or digital players (GAFAM).
Given the large number of players, there is no reliable, relevant
information available on market shares.

Orange Business Services activities

Orange Business Services (OBS) offers a wide range of products and
services, including those that are packaged or tailor-made and using
different methods such as integrated, managed or Cloud, aimed at
accompanying businesses in their digital transformation, structured
around their main challenges (connectivity, mobility, streamlining of
processes, fluidity of exchanges with customers and support for their
projects).

OBS has structured its portfolio of offers around four main types of
products and services:

fixed telephony (traditional and IP) and audio conference services;

enterprise mobile telephony offers;

network offers, including certain service guarantee levels (mobile
and fixed-line connectivity, data transfer, hybrid networks, fixed-line
and mobile convergence offers);

1.4.6.2 Content activities

Content distribution activities (TV, video-on-demand, music, video
games) are a key component of Orange's strategy as a multi-service
operator with more than 9.5 million households connected to its TV
universe at the end of 2018. These activities help promote the Group's
very high-speed broadband, fiber optic and 4G offers. In 2017, the
Group created a cross-functional entity, Orange Content, to manage
its content strategy and support all Group countries in these activities.

Orange’s content strategy is primarily based on developing partnerships.
with rights holders and service publishers. Orange is focused on its
role of aggregator and distributor by referencing the best entertainment
services available in order to offer them to its customers through its
broadband networks.

Orange is also developing an ambitious strategy for producing and
co-producing films and series, as well as publishing via its subsidiary
Orange Studio and its premium OCS service (formerly, Orange cinéma
séries). All of these programs are available in linear broadcast form
and on demand. They are offered by most distributors in France and
available live on the Internet. At end-2018, OCS had 2.9 million
subscribers.

In 2018, Orange notably invested in two international series, “The
Name of the Rose” and “Devils”, which will be broadcast on OCS, and
co-produced the movie, “Les Chatouilles” which was nominated for
the Cannes Film Festival. In addition, at the end of 2018, Orange
Studio launched the development of two series based on original
works. At the same time, Orange Studio continued to enrich its catalog
and launched an international sales activity via an agreement with UGC.

In 2018, Orange also renewed its commitment with professional movie
organizations to invest, through OCS, in French and European movie
productions, increasing its commitment to 125 million euros over the
next three years. Orange also ratified the new media time-line which
will shorten the time required for movies to be broadcast on OCS after
their theater release date.

1.4.7 Orange Bank

Business diversification is one of the major pillars of the Orange group's
Essentials2020 strategy. The launch of Orange Bank on November 2,
2017, underscores the Group's ambition to diversify into mobile financial
services which offer significant growth prospects due, notably, to
Orange's in-depth knowledge of customer uses and expectations.
With Orange Bank, the Group is aiming to provide a simple offer based
on a smooth, personalized customer experience, as in Africa where
the payment and money transfer service offered by Orange Money
has enjoyed success for several years.

After France, the Group is planning to launch Orange Bank in Spain
at the end of 2019.

The banking market

Although the banking market in France is still largely dominated by
traditional banks, some new models are beginning to make their mark.
In 2018, online banks had a market share of 3% (source: KANTAR-TNS,
February 2018)".

The whole sector, which is undergoing far-reaching change, has
become highly digitized. There are six major categories of player:

= the major traditional banking networks (which are gradually adapting
their offers to the new situation). For example, La Banque Postale,
which is preparing to launch Ma French Bank in 2019;

(1) SoFia study report on monitoring banking, savings, life-insurance and credit markets.

Overview of the Group and of its business — 1

Operating activities

In Europe, the Group is pursuing the roll-out of content services,
notably related to TV, a key element of convergence offers. As such,
Orange is marketing TV channel packages in Spain based on soccer
offers (La Liga and Champions League) whose distribution rights were
renewed for the 2018/2019 season, and has launched its Orange
Series 4k channel. The Group’s other European subsidiaries are also
developing this TV strategy, for example in Slovakia, with the launch
ofa satellite offer and an Orange Sport channel in August 2018 which
offers exclusive coverage of the Champions League.

In Africa, Orange also continued to enhance its TV offers and ventured
into production, particularly in Senegal with the Diamond House series.
In the mobile sector, Orange also developed distribution partnerships
in 2018 with several content publishers (video, games and music). In
the video-on-demand segment, Orange offers programs from the
catalogs of the major distributors.

The music market confirmed its revival in 2018 with growth in activity
driven by streaming. In mid-2018, Orange reinvested in Deezer, which
has been a partner of the Group since 2010. The number of paying
subscribers has continued to grow and the service is now available in
France, Spain, Romania, Luxembourg and Cote d'\voire. At the same
time, Orange continues to roll out its Orange Radio service, which is
now available in 17 countries.

In the video games sector, the Orange TV games streaming offer
continued to grow in 2018. In the mobile segment, the success of the
unlimited contract and Freemium games continued, with the relaunch
of the Orange Juegos offer in Spain and sustained momentum in the
African countries where the number of Orange mobile-game customers
exceeded the million mark. In response to the real craze for eSports
in Africa, Orange organized the first Orange eSports Experience in
2018, the first pan-African video game competition that brought
together people from about ten countries for the Dakar final.

= online banks (of which some are subsidiaries of the traditional major
banking networks) which developed mainly during the 2000s
(Boursorama Banque, ING Direct, etc.);

= neo-banks, set up in the 2010's, which are based on a mobile
application and simplified customer experience. Some have a
banking license, others do not (N26, Revolut, Compte Nickel, etc.);

= Fintechs (financing platforms, means of payment and account
aggregators);

= the tech giants who offer mobile payment solutions: Apple Pay, the
Facebook Messenger payment function, Samsung Pay and Android
Pay, etc. Through banking licenses, they can now directly offer
financial services;

= lastly, large retailers (Carrefour, Leclerc, Fnac Darty, etc.), which aim
to take a share of the mobile financial services value chain. Some of
these brands already have banking subsidiaries and offer a range of
services from bank accounts to consumer credit. Others offer means
of payment to generate customer loyalty, better know customers
and avoid “disintermediation” by losing payment-related data.

Orange Bank activities

Orange Bank is positioned at the frontier of the banking and telecom
sectors. Its business model aims at combining the features of all of its
competitors in a single offer.

Modeled originally on the mobile uses of customers, the offer carries
no conditions related to income, savings or minimum balance. There
are no bank charges attached to accounts and their associated bank
cards (subject to certain terms and conditions of use). All basic banking
services are offered: bank account, bank card, checkbook, authorized
overdraft, savings account, a /a carte insurance and personal loan.
Customers can perform all their banking operations on a mobile
handset. When opening a bank account, customers have access to
a network of more than 200 approved stores.

Strongly relying on telecoms functions, Orange Bank's innovations
offer customers the option of making contactless payments with credit

1.5

1.5.1

For Orange Group, the networks are a strategic asset and, as such,
are subject to constant supervision, maintenance and modernization.

Orange’s networks

At end-2018, Orange operated networks in almost 30 countries to
serve its customers in the consumer market and in nearly 200 countries
or territories to serve its Business customers. In line with its
Essentials2020 strategy (see Section 1.2.2 The Orange group strategy),
Orange continues to modernize its networks in order to provide its
customers with ever greater and enhanced connectivity wherever it
operates.

The Group's investments in its networks, other than those to maintain
their quality (pole, cable and pylon replacement) are designed to
improve these networks in a number of respects:

the development of very high-speed fixed and mobile broadband
(FTTH and 4G), increased data transfer volumes and reduced
connection latency. These investments concern all of the networks,
from the mobile radio network and household Internet connectivity
to submarine cables;

implementation of the program to switch all services over to the IP
infrastructure (“all-IP" program);

the gradual virtualization of network control functions
(‘programmability" of networks so that they can be adapted more
quickly to new services and uses);

automation of network operation which improves the quality of
service for customers.

The network architecture is broken down into (i) access networks
(fixed or mobile), (ii) transmission and IP transport networks and (iii)
service control networks.

Access networks connect each customer, whether an individual or a
business customer, and provide a first level of customer data
aggregation. Transmission and IP transport networks connect the
access networks between them and with the service and data servers,
which may be located in other parts of the world. Service control
networks, which drive access, transmission and IP transport networks,
provide the connection between people and manage the services
(voice, TY, Internet access, data).

A glossary defining several of the technical terms used in this section
may be found in Section 7.2.2 at the end of this Registration Document.

cards or via mobile handsets, gaining immediate access to their bank
account balance, temporarily blocking and unblocking their credit
card from the application and sending money by SMS. Customer
relations are based on the virtual advisor, Djingo, the bank's first point
of contact, available 24/7. Since the launch, there have been more
than one million discussions, of which 50% were managed entirely by
the virtual advisor without redirection to the customer relationship
center.

2018 was particularly notable for the launch of a personal loan offer
in March. Orange Bank has also received several awards, and was
notably rated “best digital customer experience” in July 2018 by the
D-Rating agency (no. 1 out of 18 banks evaluated on the basis of
400 criteria).

Orange Bank had 248,000 customers at December 31, 2018.

Networks and real-estate

1.5.1.1 Access networks

Fixed access networks

Analog access and ADSL/vDSL broadband access

Copper access is made up of a pair of copper wires that connect each
customer to a concentration point and give the latter access, via the
distribution and transport network, to alocal switch. It is used to deliver
analog voice services and broadband access services.

Orange operates copper access networks in France and Poland, and
in various countries in Africa and the Middle East (Cate d'Ivoire, Jordan,
Senegal), to provide analog voice access services and data to the
Retail, Enterprise and wholesale markets.

Fixed broadband ADSL/vDSL access (for voice applications, Internet
access and television) is available:

= in France and in Poland, with coverage approaching 100% on the
incumbent local loop;

= inthe Africa & Middle East countries, where Orange is the operator
of the copper local loop;

= in other countries (including Egypt, Spain and Slovakia), where
Orange uses the local loop of the incumbent operators, either
unbundled or via bitstream-type offers;

= in Belgium and Romania, where broadband offers are marketed
using the network of third-party operators;

= inMoldova where, following the acquisition of Sun Communications,
Orange operates a cable network.

Very high-speed broadband fiber optic access

FTTH (Fiber To The Home) network access can extend the available
broadband ADSL/vDSL service offer to include upstream and
downstream very high-speed broadband (of 100 Mbits/s and more),
with improved performance, in particular response time.

In France, Orange has been deploying FTTH access for some ten
years using GPON technology, which can pool several very high-speed
broadband accesses on a single fiber without impairing the capacity
of each access point's capacity to increase speed. The deployment


--- Page 28 ---

of the FTTH network started in 2007 in a few major French cities and
was then expanded to all large cities. During the years 2011 and 2012,
Orange entered into sharing arrangements with other telecoms
operators to speed fiber optic rollout. At end-2018, Orange was the
leading fiber optic network in France with 11.8 million households
eligible for Orange Fiber (see Section 1.3 Significant events of 2018).

In Spain, Orange is also deploying fiber and its FTTH network reached
13.8 million connectable households at end-2018. An FTTH network
was also deployed in Poland, with connectivity offered to some
3.4 million households, as well as in Slovakia with 500,000 connectable
households. The deployment of FTTH networks has also started in
Jordan, Céte d'Ivoire, Morocco and Senegal.

Radio and satellite access

In a number of African countries, fixed services are available through
3G/UMTS, or Wimax. These services are gradually migrating to 4G/LTE
technology. In Eastern Europe, fixed services are provided through
AG/LTE in addition to copper and fiber optic networks.

In addition to copper, fiber and radio access, fixed residential access
and satellite television services are also marketed via satellite capacity
rental.

Mobile access networks

The GSM (2G), UMTS (3G) and LTE (4G) access networks support
voice and data communication services that reach several tens of
Mbits/s, at an average bit rate, and up to several hundreds when
conditions are optimal, which makes it easier to send and receive
voluminous content (audio, photo and video). The Group operates a
mobile network (2G/3G/4G) in each of the countries where it offers
retail consumer telecommunications services.

To reduce its environmental impact and operating costs, Orange
shares more than half of its radio sites with a competitor. Sharing can
be either “passive” (limited to the masts only), or “active” (masts and
active equipment).

2018 was marked by:

= continued growth of uses and traffic, across the Group's networks.
To anticipate this growth, which will continue over the coming years,
the Group invested in its networks to increase their capabilities and
performance;

preparing for 5G, particularly with preparations for the optical fiber
connectivity of radio sites, in anticipation of needs related to 5G very
high-speed broadband;

continued rollout of 4G/4G+ networks in Europe to increase the
coverage of the population and speeds;

= continued 4G deployments in the MEA region, with 14 of the
20 countries in the region commercially covered at end-2018;

for the Internet of Things (loT), continued deployment of LTE-M
technology on the 4G network in European countries.

1.5.1.2 Transmission and IP transport networks

National networks

Ineach country where there are retail customers, Orange has a national
IP transport network relying on a transmission network. This
infrastructure is primarily made up of fiber optics, but also radio links,
especially for alternative or purely mobile networks in MEA countries.

Overview of the Group and of its business — 1

Networks and real-estate

These networks support voice and data traffic, for fixed, mobile,
enterprise and wholesale services.

In France, a dedicated Enterprise IP network is also in service. The
main purpose of this network is to connect a company’s French sites
for internal data exchange on a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and
provide it with Internet connectivity. It also provides Voice over IP
transport for companies.

Optical links offer a bandwidth of up to 100 Gbits/s per wavelength,
and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing technology (DWDM)
makes it possible to have 80 wavelengths per fiber. Orange is one of
the world leaders in the use of advanced optical functions in order to
have a more flexible transmission network. For example, in a first of
its kind worldwide, Orange deployed a 400 Gbits/s per wavelength
optical link between Paris and Lyon in 2013.

Furthermore, Orange offers direct connections by fiber optic to business
customers, providing them with very high-speed broadband services.

In the MEA region, Orange is the no. 1 telecommunications operator
in kilometers of terrestrial transmission networks deployed (national
and multi-country) with over 20,000 km.

International network
This international network relies on three networks:

= the European WELDON (WidE Long distance Domestic Optical
Network) network, a long-distance network in France, whose
deployment started in April 2012, and which was extended to serve
Frankfurt, London, Barcelona, Madrid, and submarine cable stations.
It is expected to be extended to other areas neighboring France as
needed in the future;

= the North-American backbone served by the two arms of the TAT-
14 transatlantic cable system;

= and the Asian backbone in Singapore served by the SEA-ME-WE3
and SEA-ME-WE4 submarine cables.

Satellites

Orange uses satellite communications to provide VSAT services (Very
Small Aperture Terminal) to Orange Business Services’ terrestrial or
maritime customers and to ensure connection with isolated mobile
sites in Africa and IP or voice connectivity to other operators. To
provide those services, Orange purchases space segment from satellite
operators (such as Eutelsat, Intelsat, SES and Arabsat).

Submarine cables

To address the strong growth in international telecommunications
traffic and in a highly competitive market, Orange is maintaining its
level of investment in submarine cables and is continuing to develop
its network in order to meet the needs of its customers. Due to the
high cost of investments required in the construction of cables, such
investments are carried out with the different players involved
(operators, private companies, GAFAM) and in various forms
(consortiums, purchase of user rights, transmission-capacity rental, etc.)

Orange is part of some 50 consortiums covering various routes: North
Atlantic, Caribbean, Europe-Asia, Europe-Africa. In 2018, the Kanawa
cable linking Martinique and French Guiana was deployed, various
cables were upgraded and some new projects launched (Dunant in the
North Atlantic, and PEACE between Europe, East Africa and Pakistan).

1.5.1.3 Service control networks

National networks

Control network

In all countries where it has access and transmission/IP transport
networks, Orange operates a control network (also called signaling
network). This network manages calls or data connection, updates of
location data for mobiles, roaming and SMS. These networks are
upgrading to new standards, for example to manage 4G roaming.

Fixed-line voice network

In the countries in which it has fixed-line operations, Orange operates
a switched telephone network (STN) to deliver analog voice and ISDN
digital services. These networks are continually being optimized
because of declining usage. In France, Orange stopped marketing its
analog voice services at the end of 2018, and announced the first
zones where voice services will only be available using IP technology
from the end of 2023.

Orange also rolled out fixed-line VoIP networks using IMS technology
(IP Multimedia Subsystem) in many countries for residential and
business uses.

Mobile voice network

Until 2015, all mobile voice traffic was managed in switch mode by
the mobile network in each country. In 2015, Orange rolled out mobile
IMS infrastructure in Europe to offer VoLTE services (VoIP over LTE)

1.5.2

The Orange group's real-estate is made up of office buildings, technical
buildings and points of sale. At December 31, 2018, the real-estate
assets recorded in Orange's balance sheet had a net carrying value
of 2.48 billion euros, compared with 2.54 billion euros in 2017.

Real-estate

Making full use of real-estate as one of its key transformation drivers,
Orange is pursuing an ambitious program throughout France,
comprising some fifteen major projects scheduled for delivery between
2018 and 2023.

At end-2018, Orange occupied in France 25,190 sites (including
211 with a surface area greater than 5,000 sq.m.), covering a total
area of 5.5 million sq.m. including 2 million sq.m. of leased space and
3.5 million sq.m. of fully-owned space. Anumber of subsidiaries abroad
also have significant real-estate portfolios, in particular Poland with
12.3 million sq.m. ofland, including 1.6 million sq.m. of developed land.

In France, 84% of technical buildings are fully-owned, while 58% of
service buildings are rented.

The buildings are very varied in terms of sizes and purposes.

Some service campuses, such as Orange Gardens in Chatillon, and
by 2020, the Lyon 2020 project, as well as the Group's future
headquarters in Issy les Moulineaux, have surface areas of more than
50,000 sq.m. for thousands of employees.

and VoWifi (mobile Voice over WiFi). The first commercial application
of this technology was in Romania, with the launch of VoLTE in
September 2015. At end-2018, VoLTE and VoWifi were used by
millions of customers in our European networks.

International networks

Voice network

Orange has international switching nodes (CTI 4G) to manage voice
traffic to and from France in the fixed-line and mobile markets for retail
customers, businesses and operators, and to centralize the transfer
of international traffic for its subsidiaries. These switches, initially in
circuit technology (TDM), have developed into hybrid NGN nodes to
carry Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic.

Orange also operates a network for the supply of voice services for
international businesses which is based on the international IP MPLS
network.

Signaling network

Orange operates an international signaling network to manage the
signaling associated with voice traffic, roaming and SMS of 2G and
3G mobile operators. This network is developing so that it can handle,
in addition to SS7 standards, new standards such as IP SIGTRAN and
DIAMETER.

Several centralized platforms have been rolled out on the international
transit points to provide value-added services to mobile operators.

The technical buildings, some of which are unoccupied, are being
continuously streamlined: some buildings have been sold, while there
are new constructions to cater to new needs. Two new Data centers
in Val de Reuil and Chartres will thus be delivered in 2020.

In 2018, the Group pressed ahead with the transformation of its points
of sale in line with the Smart Store concept, while also taking into
account the launch of Orange Bank and the need to install ATMs in
some stores.

Within the context of its energy and environmental policy, Orange is
looking to obtain the best environmental certifications for its buildings
under construction.

In 2018, the Group pledged to adopt a certified Global Management
System approach that already covers several of its buildings, particularly
its head office, and enables it to achieve “High Environmental Quality
Operations/Sustainable Management” certifications. In 2019, new
buildings currently under construction in Lille and Rennes will be
included in this approach.

At the international level, a number of significant projects are either
ongoing, notably the headquarters of Orange Céte d'Ivoire, or being
studied, such as Orange Guinée’s and Orange Mali’s headquarter
buildings and the extension of Orange Sonatel buildings in Dakar.

In the information and communication technology (ICT) sector, which
is undergoing major change in its value chain with the increase in the
number of players and the creation of new economic models,
innovation is a major growth engine for the Orange group. It is
supported by a community of around 6,000 persons, including

1.6.1

Orange is currently a leading private player involved in digital research
in France. The Group is developing an open, influential and differen-
tiating research approach that is at once accessible to all and focused
on a positive view of progress. Research and innovation are key to
future growth and a differentiating factor for Orange vis-a-vis its
competitors.

Research and innovation

In order to achieve its goals in research and innovation, Orange has
established a network of expertise spanning four continents.
Technology and Global Innovation division employees work closely
with innovative ecosystems, with start-ups and developers to
accelerate innovation. Orange researchers investigate technological
breakthroughs, new usages and innovative economic models. They
invent the technologies required to deploy the networks and services
of the future.

In response to new waves of technology and to help create the
applications of the future, Orange group's research is organized into
nine areas: digital personallife, digital society, digital emerging markets,
the digital company, ambient connectivity, software infrastructure, the
Internet of Things, data and knowledge, and trust and security.
Moreover, in 2017, Orange launched three “integrative research”
platforms, that are open to its customers, the Group andits ecosystems
in order to identify and channel technological breakthroughs and uses
and to build key assets.

Orange is convinced that using artificial intelligence (Al) in aresponsible
way will open new prospects for the individual, society and the planet.
It will improve the management of cities and regions, transport,
resources (energy, financial resources, etc.) and knowledge. With over
130 internationally recognized specialists and more than 200 hires
planned in the Al field between now and 2020, Orange is making a
growing contribution to supporting the Al sector in France and Europe.
In particular, it is partnering with Microsoft's Al School, backing start-
ups and the creation of the think tank Impact Al dedicated to
responsible Al with members of the French digital ecosystem, and
participating in the European agenda on Al.

Orange is actively preparing for the arrival of the 5G network with all
the players involved (research organization, other operators, manu-
facturers, entrepreneurs and large companies) to get a better

Intellectual Property and Licensing protects, manages and adds value
to Orange's patent portfolio, which are among the Group's intangible
assets. It also adds value to software. This offers Orange a differentiating
advantage over its academic and industrial partners, and also serves
to defend the Group's interests in the event of litigation.

At December 31, 2018, the Orange group had a portfolio of
6,857 patents or patent applications in France and abroad protecting
its innovations. In order to maximize their value, some of these patents
are licensed through patent pools for patents corresponding to industry
standards (e.g. NFC, MPEG Audio, WiFi, HEVC). Value maximization
also concerns software such as engineering tools for the mobile network.

640 researchers. In 2018, the Group continued its research and
innovation activities devoting 700 million euros (i.e. 1.7% of revenue)
to them including employee costs, as well as operating and investment
expenditure related to research and innovation for new products and
services.

understanding of the issues, new business models and new uses, and
therefore be able to take advantage of all the opportunities offered by
5G. For Orange, the development of 5G will be based on three main
areas: enhanced mobile broadband to accommodate the growth in
uses (with a speed ten times faster than 4G); an alternative to access
very high broadband in countries where fiber infrastructures are little
deployed; and, finally, the deployment of new services to support the
digital transformation of companies.

The Internet of Things (loT) is one of the diversification areas in which
Orange is aiming to become a key player in Europe on the retail and
Enterprise markets. In 2018, Orange pursued the deployment of its
loT networks in Europe (LoRa® and LTE-M). On the Enterprise market,
Orange emphasizes ready-to-use offers notably with the launch of
Smart Tracking, a solution designed to localize and track goods and
equipment, which includes beacons, connectivity, a collection platform
(Live Objects) and a visualization portal to trace objects. On the retail
market, Orange launched in Spain Serena, a helpline for senior citizens,
and Alarma de Orange, a telemonitoring service. On the French market,
the launch of Maison Protégée, a telemonitoring offer, and Maison
Connectée, a service to connect devices directly to the Livebox,
operate them remotely, monitor their use and analyze their
consumption, is planned for spring 2019.

In addition to 5G and loT, Orange is focusing its connectivity innovation
on the virtualization of networks (which allows the emergence of new
services and offers greater flexibility) as well as their automation. So-
called Self-Organizing Network (SON) features are integrated in the
latest generation of mobile networks.

Orange presented its key innovations before an audience of
1,000 business leaders, decision-makers, tech experts and journalists
at the 6th edition of Show Hello. Flagship event in the French digital
landscape, it underscores Orange's innovative expertise. Among the
innovations presented was the Djingo smart speaker developed with
Deutsche Telekom, within the framework of the European A\ alliance.
Djingo, which is also voice controlled, is destined to become the
preferred interface for all Orange services. It will also offer a wide range
of daily services thanks to partnerships with selected players. Deutsche
Telekom also uses it for its own assistant, Magenta.

Intellectual Property and Licensing

In 2018, 222 new inventions were protected by patents, including
major technical contributions to standardization (5G, coding, video,
etc.). The Orange Labs network in France and abroad accounts for
the bulk of the Group's inventions. In 2017, Orange ranked among the
top three telecoms operators who filed patents in Europe (source:
European Patents Office, Top 25 applicants per leading field of
technology in 2017) and among the top 15 applicants across all
industries in France (source: INPI, 2017 award for leading patent
applicants).

Research and innovation

1.6.3

More than ever, Open Innovation is a crucial strategy for research and
innovation in order to capture trends and benefit from partners’ skills,
while relying on ecosystems that enable sustainable development.
At Orange, this strategy is embodied by:

Open innovation

= the Orange Developer program, through which the Group opens its
service platforms to application developers. At end-2018, Orange
had a catalog of 60 self-service programing interfaces (APIs) in the
areas of identification, payment, communications, loT and data.
These interfaces cover Retail services in Europe and Africa and
Middle East, and Enterprises around the world;

= start-up and SME support. Orange has developed a network of
15 start-up accelerators known as Orange Fab, present in
16 countries across four continents at the end of 2018. Created in
Silicon Valley in March 2013, the Orange Fab program was rolled
out in France the same year, then in other countries from 2014
onwards. In 2018, this program was extended to Tunisia. Orange
helps selected start-ups grow their businesses, and in certain
countries provides financial and logistical support. Over 350 start-
ups were or are being accelerated by Orange Fab as at end-2018;

the alliance created in 2015 with Deutsche Telekom, Singtel and
Telefonica gives selected start-ups access to the resources and
markets of the four partners, thus promoting the emergence of new
European and even global leaders. Known as “Go Ignite”, a third
edition was launched at the 2018 Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona. It is designed for start-ups which are in a growth phase
and have already developed marketable solutions in the following
six areas: artificial intelligence (Al), cyber security, 5G, Big Data analytics,
improving customer experience and the Internet of Things (loT);

= Orange's presence in various global networks and events, notably
in the French Tech network and at Viva Technology, where Orange
presented some one hundred start-ups in 2018;

1.6.4

The Orange group plays a key role in financing innovation in the IT
industry, drawing on various investment vectors managed by Orange
Digital Investment:

Capital investment

= investment vehicles that are wholly-owned by the Group, known as.
mono-corporate ventures, in particular Orange Digital Ventures,
which are in line with Orange’s Open Innovation strategy, through
which Orange acquires minority stakes in innovative start-ups,
particularly in the following areas: new types of connectivity,
corporate digital services (SaaS, Big Data, artificial intelligence,
security, digitization of processes, etc.), Mobile Banking and mobile
payment (FinTech), Internet of Things, and digital services for the
Africa and Middle East region.

This approach has two objectives: one of a financial nature (to
generate capital gains on disposals) and the other to gain insight
into new markets, disruptive business models and agile project
management. In addition, start-ups not only obtain a source of
financing, but also benefit from the Group's expertise and, where
appropriate, its customer relationships (in particular B2B).

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

= a strong involvement in the research and innovation ecosystems.
Orange is a key player in collaborative research programs and
contributes to over 50 national and European projects, such as the
major A/4EU initiative, which brings together the biggest artificial
intelligence players in Europe. Orange is also very involved in the
European public-private partnership on 5G, which has 22 projects
including the recent autonomous driving cross-border project
(6GCroco). The Group is also working increasingly in opensource
consortiums;

the development of ecosystems of excellence in France, in which
Orange is a major player through its involvement in seven
competitiveness clusters (including being the chair of the Images &
Réseaux cluster) within a network of more than 3,000 industrial and
academic players. The Group's investment in the development of
technologies that ensure sovereignty for France and Europe is also
embodied by its involvement in the Technological Research Institute
b<>com which is chaired by Orange in the area of technology
networks, security, hypermedia and Al;

= 30 research contracts concluded with the finest university
laboratories as well as two joint laboratories with Inria on the
virtualization of network functions, and with the University of Nice
‘on antennae;

= the co-funding of 13 research chairs including one with the
Polytechnique and Télécom Paris Tech on the economy and
regulation, and another with the Institut Mines-Télécom on personal
information values and policies.

Lastly, Orange has an active policy of forming strategic partnerships
with leading industrial players worldwide, which allows it to enhance
its portfolio of products and services and open itself to new ecosystems.

In 2018, the Group used mono-corporate venture financing to invest
in five new start-ups: Morphisec (cyber security, Israel), NGD
(computational storage, United States), Aire (credit scoring, United
Kingdom), Africa's Talking (communication APIs, Kenya) and Yoco
(mobile point of sales, South Africa). In addition, several start-ups
in the portfolio were refinanced, bringing the total amount invested in
this scheme since 2015 to nearly 50 million euros for 20 start-ups;

multi-corporate ventures (joint investment companies), in which
Orange has generally invested with other investor-partners, mostly
industry companies, but occasionally also involving purely financial
firms. Examples include:

— the Iris Next fund and the three Orange Publicis Ventures funds
(Growth, Global and Early-Stage), created within the framework
of a partnership with the Publicis Group, and managed by Iris
Capital Management in which the Group is also involved at the
governance level,


--- Page 32 ---

— two funds who invest mainly in Africa: Partech Africa, managed
by Partech Partners, and the Franco-African Fund, managed by
Africinvest,

- several other “thematic” funds, including Robolution Capital
(focusing on robotics investments), which is managed by 360 Capital
Partners, and Ecomobilité Ventures (focusing on digital and
sustainable mobility investments), managed by Idinvest Partners.

1.7.1

In most of the countries where it operates, the Orange group must
comply with various regulatory obligations governing the provision of
its products and services, primarily relating to obtaining and renewing
telecommunication licenses, as well as to oversight by authorities
seeking to maintain effective competition in electronic communications
markets. Orange also faces specific regulatory constraints in some
countries as a result of its historically dominant position in the fixed
telecommunications market. The risks linked to the regulation of
the electronic communications sector are described in Section 2.1.2
Legal risks.

1.7.1.1 European Union

1.7.1.1.1

The European Union has laid down a common legal framework aimed
at harmonizing the regulation of electronic communications. It is binding
on the member states and must be implemented by the National
Regulatory Authorities.

Legal and regulatory framework

The overall legal framework of the European Union was modified by
the new European Electronic Communications Code which took effect
on December 20, 2018 (see Section 1.7.1.1.2 Significant events in
2018). The revised code includes four main directives deriving from
the 2002 Telecoms Package on:

= a common regulatory framework for electronic communications
networks and services;

the authorization of electronic communications networks and
services;

access to and interconnection of electronic communications
networks and associated facilities;

universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic
communications networks and services.

In addition, the Telecoms Package includes the directive on Privacy
and electronic communications no. 2002/58/EC of July 12, 2002,
concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of
privacy in the electronic communications sector.

Regulation of activities

Orange Digital Investment also monitors more mature or late stage
start-ups, which can be financed through strategic investments made
directly by the Group, such as Deezer, Jumia and Soundhound.

Overall, for its private equity business, the Group's financial investment
commitments (made via direct and indirect equity investments) total
more than 260 million euros over the last ten years.

Furthermore, Regulation (EC) no. 1211/2009 of November 25, 2009,
canceled and replaced by Regulation (EU) no. 2018/1971 of
December 11, 2018, implemented the Body of European Regulators
for Electronic Communications (BEREC).

The new regulatory framework has been fleshed out by a number of
additional texts:

Analysis of relevant markets

On October 9, 2014, the European Commission adopted a new
recommendation (2014/7 10/EC) identifying four relevant product and
service markets for which National Regulatory Authorities are required
to carry out market analyses potentially resulting in the implementation
of ex-ante regulation, as opposed to seven in its previous
recommendation of 2007:

= M 1: wholesale call termination on individual public telephone
networks provided at a fixed location;

- M2: wholesale voice call termination on individual mobile networks;

M 3/a: wholesale local access provided at a fixed location;

= M 3/b: wholesale central access provided at a fixed location for
mass-market products;

M 4: wholesale high-quality access provided at a fixed location.

Roaming

Regulation (EU) no. 2015/2120 of November 25, 2015 (also known
as the Telecoms Single Market package - TSM), which aims, in
particular, to eliminate surcharges for international roaming within the
European Union and Regulation (EU) no. 2017/920 of May 17, 2017,
which lays down the rules for wholesale roaming markets":

= impose, in the context of fair usage, the alignment of international
roaming retail prices with national prices for intra-European
communications (voice, SMS and data) from June 15, 2017;

= expands, for customers using their cell phones outside the EU,
pricing transparency requirements and bill shock prevention
measures for European operators;

(1) These rules amended regulation no. 531/2012 of June 13, 2012 on roaming using public mobile communications networks within the Union (Roaming Ill. They are rounded out by an
implementing regulation on reasonable usage rules for intra-European roaming adopted on December 15, 2016.

= grant a regulated right of access to European roaming services for MVNOs and resellers, and sets new caps on wholesale markets:

- voice: €0.032 excluding tax per minute starting on June 15, 2017,
~ SMS: €0.01 excluding tax per SMS from June 15, 2017,

- data (price excluding tax):

€4.5/GB €3.5/GB €3.0/GB €2.5/GB

Apreparatory review, prior to the potential modification of the regulation
of wholesale roaming prices is scheduled for 2019.

Suppliers of mobile services subject to the regulation on the pricing of
intra-European roaming can apply a reasonable usage policy to their
customers in terms of the consumption of these services in order to
prevent abnormal or excessive use. Despite this option, in special and
exceptional circumstances, when the supply of intra-European roaming
at the national price threatens the viability of the supplier's national
pricing model, they can ask the national regulator for authorization to
bill additional charges for the use of intra-European roaming, which
are limited to the caps on wholesale roaming prices.

Call termination rates

On May 7, 2009, the European Commission adopted a
recommendation (2009/396/EC) regulating fixed and mobile voice call
termination rates in the European Union. The Commission
recommends that national authorities should apply the following
principles:

= symmetry in each Member State, first between the various operators’
fixed-line voice call termination rates and second between their
mobile call termination rates, with the option of allowing a four-year
transitional asymmetry on fixed or mobile call termination rates for
any new entrants;

= call termination rates geared towards the avoidable cost of this
service for an efficient operator (i.e. about 1 euro cent per minute
for voice MTRs and a lower rate for voice FTRs).

European Electronic Communications Code

December 2018 Entry into effect of the European Electronic Communications Code
Protecting Personal Data

May 2018 Entry into effect of the reform on personal data protection rules

Adoption of the new European Electronic
Communications Code

The new European Electronic Communications Code was published
in the Official Journal of the European Union on December 17, 2018
(EU Directive 2018/1972). It took effect on December 20, 2018. The
Member States have 24 months to transpose it into national law.

The Code includes a regulatory objective intended to support the
deployment and adoption of very high-connectivity networks in
accordance with Orange's request that the goals of the regulation be
redirected, from the transition of monopoly to competition, to
investment in telecommunication networks.

In addition, the rules governing the access obligations imposed on
operators with significant market power have been adjusted in a
positive way:

1) in practice, access obligations should generally be limited to fixed
access infrastructure and to situations in which there are fewer
than three competitors;

2) national authorities should only approve access to new fiber optic
infrastructure for competitors willing to share the investment risk.
Waivers to this principle will be subject to strict conditions and to
a veto by the Commission;

3) obligations to provide access to fixed-access infrastructure serving
subscribers, whose replicability is technically or economically
inefficient, and that are symmetrically applicable to all infrastructure
owners, can be imposed by the national regulator. These
Obligations are subject to a joint veto by the Commission and
BEREC.

With respect to the allocation of the radio frequencies required for
mobile services, the Code strengthens binding European rules for
member states, including the minimum duration of spectrum licenses.
Implementation is national, with light European oversight. Provisions
facilitating the deployment of “limited range wireless access points"
(defined in Article 2.23 of the Code) and the availability schedule of the
5G spectrum were also adopted.

With respect to the regulation of communication services, most of
the obligations intended to protect end-users are for Internet access
service and services using public numbering plan resources,
independently of the service provider. Other services, such as
interpersonal communication services independent of the numbering
plan and signal transport services are only subject to a limited number
of obligations. However, the Code reintroduces rules on competitive
markets for intra-European calls and SMS by imposing a cap aligned
with the caps of the 2012 Regulation, known as Roaming Ill
(€0.19/minute and €0.06/SMS).

With respect to universal service obligations, the Code promotes
the goal of supplying Internet access services which are both available
and affordable but maintains the principle of the appointment of
specific universal service suppliers and of a financing system provided
by the industry. In addition, the Code opens the door to the extension
of universal service obligations for the supply of affordable mobile
services.

The Code and its associated regulation on changes in BEREC’s
responsibilities and governance do not create a European regulator.
However, the Code does adopt the principle of full standardization of
the rights of end-users, subject to exceptions, and strengthens the
control exercised by the European Commission over access regulation
and over the spectrum.

Protecting Personal Data

The new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect
on May 25, 2018. The GDPR, which replaces a 1995 European
directive, is a general-purpose regulation intended for both public and
private entities which harmonizes the management of personal data
protection in Europe.

GDPR principles include:

= single rules directly applicable immediately in each European Union
country;

application to all Internet users and service providers of the
information society intended for the European market;

a single supervisory authority responsible for the protection of data
as the interlocutor for Internet companies: that of the Union country
in which they have their primary office;

= unambiguous consent which explicitly covers the processing of
personal data;

= definition of a pseudonymization process whose use is encouraged;
= strengthening of the obligation to provide information to consumers;
= the introduction of a “digital right to be forgotten”.

National personal data protection authorities will have enhanced
powers. They will be authorized to fine companies which breach
European rules up to 4% of the annual overall revenue of the companies
in question. In addition, the entry into effect of the GDPR has indirect
effects on the implementation of sector directive no. 2002/58/EC on
privacy and electronic communications of July 12, 2002 given that it
changes the meaning of the concept of consent and the penalties to
which this directive refers. The Commission wants to replace the 2002
directive with a new sector regulation, but there has been no political
agreement on the new text.

1.7.1.2.1 Legal and regulatory framework

Legal framework

The electronic communications sector is primarily governed by the
French Postal and Electronic Communications Code as well as legal
provisions relating to e-commerce, the information society, consumer
protection and personal data protection.

France transposed the European Telecoms Package, as amended in
2009, via the order of August 24, 2011 and the decree of March 12,
2012 for the implementing regulations.

The audiovisual communication services produced or distributed by
the Orange group come under the specific regulations governing this
sector and are governed by law no. 86-1067 of September 30, 1986
on the Freedom of Communication.

Regulatory Authorities

The Postal and Electronic Communications Regulatory Authority
(Arcep) is an independent administrative body created by the law of
July 26, 1996 and acts as the French regulator for these sectors
nationwide. Within the electronic communications sector, Arcep’s main
missions are to define regulations for operators present in the markets
in question. It has powers to sanction non-compliant operators and
can rule on disputes between operators over technical and pricing

1.7.1.2.2 Regulation of mobile telephony

Significant events in 2018

conditions for network access and interconnection. Arcep also
allocates spectrum and numbering resources. Finally, it determines
the size of contributions to fund the universal service obligation and
oversees the mechanisms for delivering this funding.

The French Competition Authority is an independent government
authority responsible for ensuring open market competition and
compliance with public economic policy. It has jurisdiction over all
business segments, including the electronic communications sector.
It has sanction powers for anti-competitive practices, as well as
consultative powers. It is also responsible for overseeing mergers and
acquisitions.

The ANFr (Agence nationale des fréquences - French national
agency for frequencies) is responsible for planning, managing and
controlling the usage of radio frequencies and for coordinating the
establishment of certain radio transmission facilities. The frequency
spectrum is covered by 11 controlling authorities: government
departments, Arcep and the French Broadcasting Authority (CSA).
Arcep and the CSA are in turn responsible for allotting to users the
frequencies they control.

The CSA (Conseil Supérieur de I’Audiovisuel) is an independent
administrative body created by the law of January 17, 1989. It is
tasked with protecting the freedom of audiovisual communication in
accordance with the law of September 30, 1986.

mobile operators (accounting separation)

Following the work carried out by Arcep, an agreement was signed
on January 14, 2018 between the French government, Arcep and the
four mobile operators (Orange, SFR, Bouygues Telecom and Free
Mobile) to guarantee better mobile coverage throughout the country
and, in particular, in rural areas. The agreement (known as the “New

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

Deal”) is the result of negotiations carried out for the expected
reallocation of authorizations to use frequencies in the 900, 1,800 and
2,100 MHz bands for 10 years. The operators committed to providing
enhanced coverage starting in 2018 (see below) in exchange for the
elimination of auctions and the stability of current fees.

The New Deal Mobile coverage

By decision of Arcep on July 3, 2018, coverage commitments under
the New Deal (see below) for the period before 2021 are applicable
immediately within the framework of current operator authorizations
for the 900, 1,800 and 2,100 MHz bands.

The call for applications process for the allocation of frequencies in
the 900, 1,800 and 2,100 MHz bands was initiated on August 2, 2018.
The authorizations to use the relevant frequencies were adopted by
Arcep on November 15, 2018. These authorizations will take effect for
Orange from 2021.

5G bands (3.4-3.8 GHz, 26 GHz and 1.4 GHz)

The Government and Arcep provided information about the road map
for 5G in France on July 16, 2018.

Three bands are considered at this point: the 3.4-3.8 GHz, the 26 GHz
and the 1.4 GHz bands for allocation at the end of 2019 or in early
2020. A first consultation was launched on October 26, 2018 on the
allocation of new frequencies for 5G in these three bands. A second
consultation on the allocation procedure has been announced for
April 2019.

The New Deal agreement
Under the New Deal, operators committed to:

= accelerating the pace of targeted programs to improve coverage
and, within this context, for each one to cover at least 5,000 new
areas throughout the country (most of which will be shared by the
operators) replacing existing programs (the “town center dead
zones” program, the “800 strategic sites” program and the “France
Mobile” program) for which the operators will now be fully
responsible;

= generalizing 4G reception by equipping all of their mobile sites with
4G by the end of 2020, 75% of the “town center dead zones”
program sites by the end of 2020 and 100% by the end of 2022;

= accelerating the coverage of transport routes, ensuring that the
main road and rail routes have 4G coverage. The agreement includes
provisions for the coverage of regional trains;

= generalizing coverage within buildings, in two parts: gradual
availability of voice and SMS services via Wi-Fi with the goal of
enabling 80% of our customers with a compatible handset to benefit
from these services by the end of 2019, and the marketing of an
offering enabling public companies and individuals who so request
to obtain improved indoor multi-operator coverage of their buildings
at a reasonable rate;

improving reception quality throughout the country, and particularly
in rural areas. The new performance standard applied to operator
obligations will be that of “good coverage” defined as the “ability to
be able to call and exchange SMS outside of buildings in most
cases and within buildings in some cases".

Operators have an obligation to provide mobile radiotelephony service
under the “good coverage” conditions required by Arcep to 99.6% of
the population by March 2024 at the latest, and to 99.8% in
March 2028. They must also provide very high-speed broadband
access from all Orange network sites with more than 5W by the end
of 2020 (excluding the town center dead zones program sites which
have a target of 75% by the end of 2020 and 100% by the end of
2022).

At end-December 2018, Orange's 4G coverage was 98.6% of the
population and 87.1% of the country.

Infrastructure sharing

The New Deal agreement contains clauses on network sharing. In
addition to active sharing, which is required for the four operators on
all sites that host them as part of the provisions for targeted coverage,
operators are subject to an overall obligation to accede to the requests
of the other operators to ensure ex-ante passive sharing in the priority
deployment zone. However, the agreement states that this obligation
can be waived if an access offering deemed satisfactory by Arcep is
available for a sufficient number of sites and at a reasonable rate.

Orange’s obligations regarding cost accounting
and accounting separation for the mobile business

On June 19, 2018, Arcep published decision no. 2018-0685 specifying
obligations for accounting for and the reporting of costs imposed on
mobile operators. The decision supersedes decision no. 2013-0520.
As was the case for the previous decision, it applies to Orange, SFR,
Bouygues Telecom, Free Mobile, SRR and Orange Caraibes. The new
decision primarily simplifies operator obligations.

Analysis of the wholesale mobile call termination markets

The fixed and mobile termination markets are regulated by Arcep
decision no. 2017-1453 for the 2017-2020 cycle. The decision
confirms the cost-orientation obligation for call termination rates. The
cap levels for call termination were eliminated in the final decision.
Mobile operators, including Orange, have left their rates unchanged
since 2017.

The ex-ante asymmetric regulation which Orange's fixed services are
subject to relates solely to wholesale offers ensuring effective
competition in retail markets (call origination and termination, wholesale
line rental, unbundling, access to the civil engineering infrastructure,
bitstream, passive access to the final segments of the FTTH network
and capacity services).

Arcep decision on the resolution of the dispute between
Free and Orange on the conditions of the FTTH contract in
less densely inhabited areas

At the end of 2017, Free requested Arcep to rule on a dispute with
Orange about the conditions for co-financed access to the Orange
FTTH network in less densely inhabited areas.

Inits decision of May 17, 2018, Arcep agreed to the following demands
from Free:

= Orange must offer Free Medium Dense Area (MDA) access to the
FTTH network for a set period of at least 40 years subject to
Orange's decision to continue the technical and commercial
operation of the FTTH network;

- the contract must define the relation between the main rates and
the costs of the co-financed network and must provide for Orange
to send Free a report on expenses presenting capital expenditures
and operating expenses separately. This issue was submitted to
the Paris Court of Appeal;

- thecontract must detail the technical and rate conditions for access
to the supernumerary fibers of the network co-financed by Free for
the connection of Free Mobile’s BTS.

Publication of enhanced coverage maps

On February 22, 2018, Arcep passed decision no. 2018-0169 on the
content and publication procedures for network coverage and fixed-
location Internet access services maps and on the methods for the
transmission of underlying information. This decision compels
operators to (i) publish coverage maps for fixed services, by speed
and by technology, with information available at the level of each
building, (ii) transmit the coverage maps to Arcep, and (iii) provide
Arcep with the underlying network data used to establish the coverage
maps.

Regulation of activities

Regulation of fixed-line electronic communications service offers:
changes in the rates of wholesale offers subject to cost orientation

On December 21, 2017, Arcep passed a decision on the rate framework for the full unbundling of the local copper loop for 2018 to 2020.
The decision sets a cap on the recurring monthly access rate for full unbundling and for the monthly recurring rate for naked bitstream access

for the next three years:

2017 rates 2018 rates 2019 rates 2020 rates

framework framework framework

Unbundling Total 9.45 € 9.31€ 9.41€ 9.51€
Bitstream Naked DSL access 12.93 € 13.19 € 13.30 € 13.41 €

In accordance with Arcep decision, the changes planned for the full
unbundling rates and for naked ADSL for 2019 were adjusted to take
into account the changes to the Imposition Forfaitaire sur les Entreprises
de Réseau (/FER) (flat-rate tax on network businesses). The tax, which
was only for copper lines, was broadened to include cabled networks
and FTTH. Lines built fewer than five years ago are exempted. In
accordance with the principle of non-discrimination, part of the
decrease in the tax paid by Orange is passed on to the alternative
operators via a reduction in wholesale rates.

Based on the new /FER value, which was definitively passed at the
end of December 2018, rates for 2019 will be, respectively,
9.27 euros/month for full unbundling and 13.16 euros/month for naked
DSL access.

Regulation of fiber optic networks

Regulatory framework governing
very high-speed broadband wholesale offers

The current regulatory framework for the deployment of very high-
speed broadband in France confirms the principle of symmetric
regulation for the terminating segment of networks, and encourages
sharing by operators, with potential co-financing following prior
consultation with the municipality:

no ex-ante regulation of retail prices;

asymmetric regulation of access to civil engineering infrastructure
which allows alternative operators to deploy their horizontal networks
on Orange’s infrastructure: non-discriminatory access at a rate that
reflects costs;

principle of sharing the terminating segment of networks between
operators;

no obligation for asymmetric access (unbundling or bitstream) for
fiber, confirmed by the 3a and 3b market analysis decisions published
by Arcep on December 14, 2017;

symmetric regulation for access to the terminating segment of
networks, including outside of very densely populated areas: same
obligation to provide passive access to the terminating segment of
FTTH networks under reasonable and non-discriminatory
conditions, applicable to all operators equipping buildings with fiber
optic in the entire French territory. Access must be from a reasonably
situated shared access point (Arcep decision no. 2009-1106
supplemented by Arcep decision no. 2010-1312 for less densely
populated areas). Rates must comply with the principles of efficiency,
relevance, auditability and non-discrimination.

Arcep is of the opinion that the FTTH regulatory framework it decided
on complies with the principles defined by the European Commission
in its NGA“ recommendation, applicable to broadband and very high-
speed networks, published on September 20, 2010. It recommends.

1) Next Generation Access network.
(2) Optical Connection Node.
(3)

asymmetric regulation requiring that operators in a dominant position
provide access to the terminating segment of very high-speed lines
and access from OCNs®! while conceding a risk premium to operators
who invest and an adaptation principle for national circumstances. The
European Commission approved Arcep’s position.

Orange's “L. 33-13” deployment commitments

In early 2018, Orange formalized its commitment proposals for FTTH
deployment under Article L. 33-13 of the French Postal and Electronic
Communications Code, confirming its prior commitments taken under
the AMIL®, in 2011, then in 2013 and 2015.

Orange proposed that it commit to ensuring that, within its FTTH
deployment scope in the AMII area: (i) by the end of 2020, 100% of
homes and professional premises would have access to FTTH sales
offers (including a maximum 8% of premises connectable on demand,
excluding refusals by third parties), and (ii) by the end of 2022, 100%
of homes and professional premises would be made connectable
(excluding refusals by third parties).

These commitment proposals took into account the agreement
reached at the end of May 2018 by Orange and SFR which led to
Orange withdrawing from 236 municipalities to SFR's benefit.

Following Arcep opinion of June 12, 2018, Orange's commitment
proposals (and those of SFR) were accepted by the French government
on July 26, 2018.

Completeness of FTTH networks

Arcep notified Orange that it must comply with the obligation for
completeness of a list of 460 shared access points (as listed in the
appendix of its decision no. 2018-1597 — RDPI), at the latest by
December 31, 2019.

Orange is required to prove its compliance with the obligation for
completeness of the 460 shared access points by January 31, 2020,
at the latest, or to explain the difficulties encountered. Arcep stated in
this respect that, “if Orange were to report exceptional difficulties
which prevent it from making certain premises connectable, Orange
should submit all appropriate supporting evidence demonstrating that
it had implemented the resources required to resolve the issues, but
that they persisted”.

Arcep decision on the resolution of the dispute between
Coriolis, THD Bretagne, an Orange subsidiary, and Megalis
regarding a FTTH bitstream offer on the public initiative
network in the Brittany region operated by THD Bretagne

In its decision of December 11, 2018, Arcep ordered THD Bretagne,
the Orange subsidiary responsible for the operation of the Megalis
public initiative network in Brittany, to provide Coriolis Telecom, within
four months, “with an offer for activated wholesale access to very high-
speed fiber optic lines enabling it to serve an end-user it operates,

AMIIl areas are areas that were the subject of calls for expressions of investment intentions by an infrastructure operator.

(4) Decrees published in the Official Journal of July 31, 2018.

stating the technical and rate conditions and providing for activation
of the lines within nine months maximum, as of the signature of the
offer by Coriolis” (Article 1). Arcep did not issue a statement on the
technical and rate conditions of the offer and sent the parties back to
negotiations.

Analysis of the relevant markets

Broadband and very high-speed broadband markets

On December 14, 2017, Arcep published the following decisions
resulting from the fifth analysis cycle of the fixed broadband and very
high-speed broadband markets for the period from December 2017
to December 2020:

= decision no. 2017-1347 for market 3a (wholesale local access
provided at a fixed location): unbundling on the copper local loop,
access to civil engineering infrastructure, passive access to the local
FTTH loop or bitstream with delivery to the optical connection node,
passive FTTH offer with quality of service;

decision no. 2017-1348 for market 3b (market for wholesale central
access provided at a fixed location for mass-market products):
regional copper bitstream or FTTH;

decision no. 2017-1349 for market 4 (high-quality wholesale access):
LPT, SDSL, FTTO and FTTE wholesale offers;

Arcep decision no. 2017-1488 of December 14, 2017 setting the
financial conditions for access to the civil engineering infrastructure
ofthe Orange local loop which confirmed most of the rules previously
decided in 2010.

These decisions extend virtually all of the obligations previously imposed
on Orange, which remains the only dominant player in the various
markets.

Inthe general market, Arcep only preserved the symmetrical framework
for FTTH, and does not impose an obligation of equivalence of inputs
on Orange. Orange committed to (i) upgrading information systems.
by September 1, 2018 for the eligibility processes and by December 31,
2018 for order processes, (ii) providing Arcep with commercial contacts.
for optical connection nodes/shared points in very densely inhabited
areas, and (iii) reducing cases of proven difficulty in connecting third
party operators to Orange's shared access points in buildings by mid-
2019.

In the Enterprise market, Orange saw its obligations in the wholesale
market increased by the introduction of new remedies:

the obligation to provide an enhanced quality of service option on
its FTTH infrastructure;

the obligation to provide a wholesale offer for passive access to the
local shared optical loop suited to new infrastructure players
dedicated to the intermediary market for activated access offers for
companies;

the obligation to provide a resale offer for its retail offers for the
enterprise market (FTTH Pro).

Regulation of activities

Fixed-line telephony

As part of its fifth round of analysis of the relevant fixed-line markets
for non-residential customers for the 2018-2020 period, on
December 21, 2017, Arcep adopted decision no. 2017-1568, which
restricts the obligation to formalize a wholesale offer for access to
telephone service to the non-residential market only.

Wholesale non-residential line rental rates are now governed by
decision no. 2018-1523 of December 5, 2018. Contract caps are
stable for 2019 and 2020 compared to previous caps (12.32 euro
cents/month for analog and 18.57 euro cents/month for digital). The
cap for call origination collected at the Operator Connection Point
associated with the contracts is 0.6584 euros/minute in 2019 and will
be 0.6958 euros/minute in 2020.

Fixed-line voice call termination

Following its decision no. 2017-1453 of December 2017, Arcep
removed the rate caps for the 2018-2020 period. Rates must be
based on costs.

Orange interconnection with Free and Free Mobile

The dispute was settled on April 12, 2018 with Orange winning five of
the seven primarily technical points related to VoIP interconnection to
the Free networks.

Universal telephony service

The order published on November 27, 2017 designates Orange as
the provider of the universal service fixed telephony component for
the “connection” and “telephone service” services for a period of three
years, during which time the end of PSTN accesses will be effective.
This designation incorporates new quality of service monitoring
indicators.

Moreover, by its decision no. 2018-0401 of April 24, 2018, Arcep set
the rules used for the calculation of the net cost of the universal service
and operator contributions for 2016.

Following the opening of a penalty procedure (L. 36.11 of the French
Postal and Electronic Communications Code) by Arcep in June 2018,
Orange was given notice in October 2018 regarding its compliance
with universal service quality of service obligations. Arcep set
intermediate obligations for the months of November and
December 2018 and for each quarter of 2019.

Quality of service of wholesale offers for the mass
and corporate markets

Following the opening of a penalty procedure (Article L. 36.11 of the
French Postal and Electronic Communications Code) by Arcep in
September 2018, Orange was given notice in December 2018 by
which Arcep required Orange to comply, starting in the first quarter of
2019, with indicators relating to production and after-sales service
processes for all of the following offers:

= mass market: unbundling, offers activated without a guarantee for
reinstatement time (DSL access);

= corporate market: LPT, copper access (DSLE, C2E, CELAN), Optical
access (CE20, C2E, CELAN).

1.7.1.4 Poland

1.7.1.4.1 Legal and regulatory framework

Orange's businesses are governed by the law of July 16, 2004 on
telecommunications, transposing the 2002 European Telecom
Package concerning electronic communications into Polish law, and
by the law of February 16, 2007 concerning competition and consumer
protection. The law of December 2012, transposing EU directives
issued in 2009, came into force on January 21, 2013. The law of
May 7, 2010, on developing telecommunication networks and services,
provides access to telecommunications and other technical
infrastructures funded by public funds.

The Ministry of Digitization, created in November 2015, is responsible
for telecommunications.

The Office of Electronic Communications (UKE) is responsible, in
particular, for telecommunications regulation and frequency manage-
ment, as well as certain functions related to broadcasting services.

Revision of the NEBA reference offers (bitstream)

On March 19, 2018, the CNMC approved the “replicability test” (ERT)
for Telefonica’s offers, which enables the setting of the wholesale price
of fiber. The monthly fee for the local NEBA offering (local activated
offer) and for access to NEBA fiber (activated offer) were set at
17.57 euros by Telefonica. The regulator confirmed with the ERT test
that the wholesale prices for Telefonica’s NEBA-local and NEBA-fiber
fiber optic offerings enable alternative operators to reproduce the main
fiber optic products offered by the incumbent operator.

The Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK) is
responsible for the application of competition law, merger control and
consumer protection.

Digital Poland

On September 11, 2018, the Ministry for Digital Affairs launched a
public consultation on updating the national very high-speed broad-
band plan. The result of the consultation will be published in 2019.

1.7.1.4.2 Regulation of mobile telephony

Mobile call termination rates

Since July 1, 2013, the symmetric mobile voice call terminations of all
operators cost 0.0429 zloty/minute, (1.00 euro cent/minute on
December 31, 2018). In accordance with the recommendations of the
European Commission, this rate is based on pure long-term
incremental costs. It can only be changed based on the evolution of
the differential costs of a efficient operator.

Following the political agreement between the Council and the
European Parliament reached in the presence of the Commission on
December 14, 2016, the 700 MHz spectrum band should be dedicated
to mobile networks in all member states from 2020. UKE has initiated
a coordination process with neighboring countries.

Infrastructure sharing

The network sharing agreement between Orange and T-Mobile Polska,
from 2011, was extended to LTE in December 2016. On May 22,
2018, Orange and T-Mobile decided to put an end to frequency
spectrum sharing in the 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz bands.

Application of Roaming Like at Home regulation

In order to handle a massive increase in the volume of traffic in certain
customer categories, Orange submitted an exemption request file to
the regulator UKE at the end of 2017, as authorized by the regulation,

to bill its roaming customers a surcharge. By the decision of April 16,
2018, the regulator authorized the exemption for one year. Orange
decided to implement the surcharges on voice and data for its pre-
paid services, starting on June 18. However, the surcharge was not
applied to customers with a contract. The authorized surcharges are:

= outgoing call: 0.0407 zloty/minute;
= incoming call: 0.0163 zloty/minute;
= SMS: 0.0081 zloty;

— MMS/1MB: 0.0060 zloty.

5G

As part of the “5G for Poland” project, the Ministry of Digitalization,
UKE and mobile operators have concluded a multilateral agreement
to assess the availability of spectrum in the main frequency bands
(700 MHz, 3.4-3.8 GHz and 2.6 GHz).

Parliament adopted amendments to the Telecommunications Act
allowing operators to use these frequency bands free of charge for
the testing of new technologies or for the reallocation of frequencies.
Twenty cities were selected for 5G tests. Orange is currently testing
in three cities (Krakow, Gliwice and Warsaw).

1.7.1.4.3 Regulation of fixed-line telephony, broadband
and very high-speed broadband Internet

The ex-ante regulation of Orange's fixed services, for the areas defined
as non-competitive, relates solely to wholesale offers.

Deregulation of markets 1 and 3/2003

On June 26, 2018, the European Union approved the decisions to
deregulate markets 1 & 3/2003 (access to the public telephone network
at a fixed location for residential and non-residential customers). The
deregulation decision provides for a transition period of two years
corresponding to the maximum duration of the contracts agreed by
the operators and their private customers.

Analysis of the wholesale broadband access market
(market 5/2007)

On October 7, 2014, the UKE made a decision on the wholesale
broadband access market (third market analysis cycle) which excludes
76 municipalities in Poland from ex-ante regulation. The portion of the
decision providing for a deregulated area was canceled by the Warsaw
Court of Appeal for procedural defects on February 14, 2018. Orange
nevertheless offers its wholesale services on a commercial basis in
these deregulated areas.

Everywhere else, Orange's obligations are maintained (on access,
non-discrimination, transparency, accounting separation and cost-

consultation was initiated by the UKE on January 11, 2019.

Analysis of the wholesale fixed broadband access market
(market 4/2007)

In its June 2, 2014 decisions as part of the second round of market
analysis on copper and fiber, the UKE maintained Orange’s obligations
in Poland (access, non-discrimination, transparency, accounting sepa-
ration and cost-based pricing). Another market analysis is planned for
2019 and a first consultation was initiated by the UKE on January 11,
2019.

Reference offer for fixed-line markets

The reference offer applies to all wholesale fixed services: call origination
and termination, wholesale line rental, partial and full unbundling and
bitstream access.

On September 4, 2018, the European Commission accepted, without
comment, the changes made to the Orange reference offer intended
to lower subscription fees for the fixed-access wholesale service and
eliminate number portability fees.

Fixed-line call termination rates

On May 30, 2018, the UKE launched a public consultation on the
reduction of fixed-line call termination rates for 75 operators. According
to the proposed drafts, the rate applicable to Orange would be reduced
from 0.013 zloty/minute (average effective rate) to 0.0032 zloty/minute.
Based on the results of the public consultations and of discussions
with the European Union, the UKE renewed the public consultation
on December 19, 2018.

Other EU countries where the Orange group operates

In its decision of May 26, 2017, the Belgian Institute for Postal Services and Telecommunications (BIPT) set the Orange mobile call termination
rate at 0.99 euro cent/minute based on the long-term incremental cost model of an efficient generic operator.

Renewal of the frequency allocations and reservation of
frequencies for a fourth operator

The federal government approved the draft royal decrees for the
700 MHz, 1,500 MHz and 3,600 MHz bands on July 26, 2018. The
exact procedure for allocating the bands will be set by future royal
decrees. The ministry announced its intention to reserve frequencies
for a fourth mobile network operator. The BIPT published a report on
the impact of such a change on the mobile telephony market on
June 26, 2018. The Council of Ministers approved the royal decrees
for licenses at the end of July to prepare for the auctioning of the
spectrum in the second half of 2019. In September 2018, the BIPT
published a consultation on the 1,400 MHz frequency schedule and
the auction process. Given the political changes which occurred at

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

the end of 2018, the date on which the government will finalize the
auction framework is uncertain. In addition, the BIPT published the
“national road map" for the 700 MHz band on October 25, 2018 in
application of the European regulation of 2017 on the use of the 470-
790 MHz frequency band in the European Union.

Cable wholesale broadband markets

A consultation on the review of the markets was initiated by the
Conference of Regulators of the electronic communications sector in
July 2017. The review concluded that there were different wholesale
markets for central access (copper/fiber versus cable) and for television
(IP-TV versus cable). On May 25, 2018, the European Commission
commented on the draft decisions for the wholesale broadband

markets (markets 3a and 3b/2014) and on the wholesale television
distribution market. The European Commission did not block the
proposal to define two central access wholesale markets for the
copper and fiber optic networks and for coaxial cable, despite its
comments on the measure. In light of this, the final decision of the
Conference of Regulators of the electronic communications sector
was approved on June 29, 2018.

In the meantime, Telenet submitted an appeal of the European
Commission's observation letter on the market analysis to the Court
of Justice of the European Communities (CJEC). In parallel, the cable
operators (Telenet, Brutélé and Nethys) submitted appeals of the
decisions regarding the market analysis to the National Court of
Appeal. The schedule of proceedings has not yet been set.

The mobile call termination rate has been 0.96 euro cent/minute since April 1, 2014. Following a public consultation closed on July 2017, the
regulatory authority (Ancom) decided to maintain the 2014 rates. However, after an in-depth inquiry by the European Commission, the Ancom
decided to lower fixed-line call termination rates to 0.84 euro cent/minute as of May 1, 2018.

In December 2018, the Romanian government approved measures
impacting several industries, including telecommunications, via
extraordinary order 114/2018. The order includes:

Mobile voice call terminations

On July 29, 2013, the regulatory authority RU issued a decision on
the call termination rates of the three mobile operators, and capped
them at 1.226 euro cent/minute.

As part of its fourth round of market analysis, the RU submitted its
draft decision setting mobile termination rates at 0.749 euro
cent/minute for all operators to the European Commission on
November 18, 2016. On December 15, 2016, the European
Commission had not commented on the market analysis.

After review of its cost model, the RU submitted a new draft decision
to the European Commission on September 30, 2017. The draft

In addition, the same order provides for an increase in the contribution
of telecommunication operators to the cost of Ancom operations of
up to 3% of revenue, and a fine of up to 10% of revenue in the event
that infrastructure is deployed without the required authorization.

Wholesale broadband markets

In the context of its second round of analysis of the 3a and 3b markets,
completed in November 2015, Ancom considered the retail broadband
market to be effectively competitive and that, as a consequence, no
obligation should be imposed on the two wholesale markets.

decision introduced an asymmetry of terminations in favor of the fourth
operator, Swan. It set rates applicable from January 1, 2018 for mobile
terminations at 0.825 euro cent/minute for operators, except for Swan,
whose rate would be 0.608 eurocent/minute. The regulator also
proposed an unprecedented increase in the formula for calculating
termination rates based on the size of the business. Following an in-
depth investigation (phase 2) by the European Commission, backed
up by an unfavorable opinion issued by BEREC on the tariff asymmetry
potentially benefiting Swan, the Slovakian regulator had to amend its
draft decision.

1.7.2

Inthe context of an increasing number of regulations, several significant
reforms of the banking and finance sector impact Orange Bank's business:

= MiFID II: In May 2014, the European Union adopted a new framework
for the financial instruments markets known as MiFID II (in the form
of a MiFID directive and a MiFIR regulation). This framework was.
transposed into French law, notably by Government orders of
June 23, 2106 and June 22, 2017 and came into effect on January 3,
2018. The goal of these regulations is to improve the security,
transparency and operation of financial markets and to strengthen
protection for investors. The regulations notably provide for an
improvement in the information given to customers about the
suitability of financial products in the light of their knowledge,
experience, financial situation and investment goals and about the
costs and fees of the services provided and the financial instruments
contracted. The regulations also increase the obligations related to
the reporting of transactions involving financial instruments to the
supervisory authorities;

= AML/CFT: decree no. 2018-284 of April 18, 2018 which supplemented
order 2016-1635, and came into effect on December 1, 2016,
transposed into French law the fourth European directive EU
2015/847 of May 20, 2015 on the prevention of the use of the
financial system for the purpose of money laundering or terrorist
financing. It strengthened the anti-money laundering framework
and requires banking institutions to determine the risk profile of each
customer and to assign a suitable monitoring profile;

- AIFM: delegated regulation no. 2018/1618 of July 12, 2018 amending
directive no. 2011/61/EU AIFM of July 1, 2011 creating aharmonized
framework for the managers of alternative investment funds and
intended to improve the protection of assets and information to
investors and to standardize the responsibility of depositaries and
sub-custodians;

= CRS: driven by the G5, then the G20, as part of its efforts to combat
international tax evasion, the “Common Reporting Standard” on the
automatic exchange of tax information was published by the OECD
on July 21, 2014 and implemented in the European Union via

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

Regulation of banking activities

directive no. 2014/107/EU of December 9, 2014. In France, the
CRS regulation came into effect on January 1, 2016 with over
100 countries committed to information exchange. More than
50 countries (including France) started exchanging information on
the basis of the CRS in September 2017. The French system was.
supplemented by decree no. 2018-569 of July 3, 2018, which has
been applicable since November 1, 2018;

Sapin Il Law: the law on transparency, combating corruption and
economic modernization of December 10, 2016 also includes
measures intended to protect savers and investors, notably by
providing a framework for requests to substitute credit insurance in
mortgages and providing for the option of waiving payment
protection insurance within a period of 14 days;

directive no. 2016/97 of January 20, 2016 on insurance distribution,
transposed into French law by Government order 2018-361 of
May 16, 2018 and by the decree of June 1, 2018 is intended to
increase consumer protection and harmonize regulations, notably
by creating a standard information document, by improving the
prevention of conflicts of interest, by imposing product governance
rules, by requiring distributors to take ongoing training and by
defining the scope of their advisory obligation;

dematerialization: the order of October 4, 2017, effective April 1,
2018, on the dematerialization of contractual relations in the financial
sector is intended to promote the use of virtual communication
media while ensuring a sufficient level of protection to consumers.
It enables customers, in certain cases, to request paper media and
that documents provided in the customer space be made available
for a sufficiently long period of time;

PSD2: as part of the creation of the single payment services market
in Europe, directive (EU) no. 2015/2366 of November 25, 2015
(PSD2, transposed into national law on August 9, 2017) adapted
existing rules to new payment services and strengthened payment
security rules. It notably imposes requirements with respect to
strong customer identification and protection of their personal
security data.

Risk factors

2.1

In addition to the information contained in this Registration Document,
investors should carefully consider the risks outlined below before
deciding whether to invest. The Company's view at the date of this
Registration Documents that these risks could have a material negative
impact (i) on the business, financial position, profits, reputation or
outlook of Orange SA and/or its subsidiaries, as well as (ii) on Orange's
stakeholders. In addition, other risks and uncertainties, as yet
unidentified or, as of the date of this Registration Document, not
currently considered to be material by Orange, could have similar
negative impacts. Investors could lose all or part of their investment if
these risks materialize.

Risk factors

The risks are presented in this section under four categories:

for Orange:

- operational risks relating to Orange's business activities (see
Section 2.1.1),

— risks of a legal nature (see Section 2.1.2),

- financial risks (see Section 2.1.3);

and for Orange and its stakeholders: the main “non-financial” risks
relating to the corporate, social and environmental consequences
of Orange's activities, and to the impacts of these activities in terms
of respect for human rights, anti-corruption measures and tax
avoidance (see Section 2.1.4).

These categories are not presented in order of importance. However,
within each category, risk factors are presented in decreasing order
of importance, as determined by the Company at the date of filing this
Registration Document. Orange may change its view of their relative
importance at any time, particularly if new external or internal facts
come to light.

2.1.1 Operational risks

Operational risks mainly include risks related to the telecommunications
sector, and risks related to Orange's strategy and business. Risks with
potentially substantial employee, environmental and _ social
consequences are presented in Section 2.1.4.

Asignificant portion of Orange’s revenues is generated in mature
markets, where intense competition between operators puts
pressure on prices and operators’ capacity to provide customers
convergent offers.

The main markets on which Orange operates are mature, and even
saturated. Under these conditions, Orange faces extremely intense
competition, which primarily impacts prices, as well as the ability to
propose convergent offers (very high-speed fixed and mobile
broadband) and even more data. Orange is therefore making
substantial investments in innovation, stepping up the deployment of
its broadband and very high-speed access networks, continuing to
implement a policy of moving towards a multi-services operator model
and reducing its fixed costs.

Should Orange fail to implement its strategy in response to this
competitive environment, it may lose a portion of its market share and
see its margins reduced.

For further information about competition, see Section 1.4 Operating
activities.

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

Several other sections of this Registration Document also discuss
risks in some detail:

= for risks relating to global risks in the telecommunications services
sector, Orange's overall strategy and its business model, see
Section 1.2;

for risks relating to regulations and regulatory pressure, see

consolidated financial statements (Section 3.3);

for risks relating to litigation involving the Group, see also Note 9
Taxes and Note 16 Litigation to the consolidated financial
statements, as well as Section 3.2 Recent events and outlook,
where applicable;

for risks relating to the Group's corporate, social and environmental
responsibility, see Chapter 4;

for financial risks, see:

group are discussed in Section 2.2 Activity and risk management
framework, which is an integral part of the Management Report.

Orange has made commitments to the French authorities that it
will step up network deployment and maintain service quality,
which could be constrained by resource availability or changes
in regulatory positions.

Orange has made commitments to public authorities and local
authorities in France that it will both step up the deployment of fixed
and mobile broadband and very high-speed networks in the regions
and maintain the service quality of its networks. These commitments
could be constrained by the availability of Orange and its
subcontractors’ human, industrial and financial resources, alongside
the Group's objective of reaching its peak CAPEX in 2018. If this
situation were to arise, Orange's profits and image could be affected
by it.

Orange is exposed to the risk of an interruption to its networks
and services following cyber-attacks, human errors or malicious
acts, and network saturation.

Damage or interruptions to the service provided to customers may
occur following cyber-attacks (on networks and IT systems), outages.
(hardware or software), human errors or sabotage of critical hardware
or software, failure of a critical supplier, or insufficient network capacity
to meet the growing usage needs, or during the implementation of
new applications or software.


--- Page 50 ---

Among these risks of interruption, telecommunications operators are
particularly exposed to malicious actions and cyber-attacks because
of the vital nature of telecommunications in the functioning of the
economy. Despite the steps taken by Orange to protect its network,
the high frequency of such attacks increases the risk of an interruption
to its services.

As a result of the rationalization of the network based on the
implementation of all-IP technologies, the increase in the size of the
service platforms and the relocation of equipment into fewer buildings,
such service interruptions may in the future affect a greater number of
customers and more than one country simultaneously.

Although difficult to quantify, the impact of such events could seriously
damage Orange's reputation, trigger its liability and result in a reduction
of traffic and its revenue, affecting its profits and outlook. If they were
to occur on a nationwide or multinational scale, they might also create
a crisis potentially affecting the security of the countries concerned.

The development of mobile financial services exposes Orange to
risks inherent to this sector.

In line with its Essentials2020 plan, Orange has developed mobile
financial services, in both banking and payment and money transfer
services. This development exposes Orange to risks inherent to this
sector, such as money laundering, terrorist financing and non-
compliance with economic sanction programs, as well as particularly
sensitive and common risks in the financial services sectors such as
fraud, cyber-attacks or service interruptions.

Furthermore, Group entities having the status of regulated institutions
could face a risk of non-compliance with applicable banking or financial
regulations, in particular if the strengthened compliance and internal
control system in place was to be found insufficient.

If these risks materialized, they could have a material effect on the
Group's financial position, completion of its strategy and image.

Orange’s large geographic footprint and the growing scope of its
activities increases its exposure to geopolitical, macroeconomic
and regulatory risks.

Orange's growth partly depends on its activities in emerging markets.
Political instability or changes in the economic, regulatory, tax or social
landscape in these geographical areas may call into question the
outlook on profitability expected when investment decisions were
made and affect the Group's financial position and results.

International economic sanctions imposed on certain countries could
also have an impact on the value or permanence of the investments
made in these countries or the future of the Group's business dealings.

High concentration among Orange’s critical suppliers creates a
risk for the Group’s business.

Orange's critical suppliers, in particular in the network infrastructure,
IT systems and mobile handset sectors, operate in highly concentrated
markets. This concentration poses a risk to the Group's business, in
the event that one of these suppliers defaults or decides to change its
business practices, regardless of the causes, including the introduction
of international economic sanctions against these critical suppliers or
their country of origin. Orange's business, profits and reputation could
be affected as a result.

Risk factors and activity management framework — 2

Risk factors

Orange’s technical infrastructure is vulnerable to damage caused
by intentional or accidental damage, or natural disasters whose
increasing frequency is caused by global warming.

A natural disaster, intentional damage in the course of wars, terrorist
acts, social unrest, or other accidental events such as fires, may cause
significant damage to Orange's installations, potentially giving rise to
service interruptions and generating high repair costs. The frequency
and intensity of weather events related to climate change (floods,
storms, heat waves) seem to be increasing, which could aggravate
accidents and increase related damage. In the longer term, rising sea
levels could affect sites and facilities near the coast. More generally,
the damage caused by major disasters may have consequences
resulting in substantial costs remaining to be supported by Orange
beyond the amounts covered by insurance, thereby impacting its
financial position and outlook.

The rapid growth in uses and the development of networks and
technologies allow global players in the Internet sector to establish
a direct link with Orange’s customers.

The growth in network usage for value-added services has resulted
in the emergence of powerful players, Over-The-Top (OTT) service
providers and Internet giants. Competition with these players extends
to individual access services offered by technological advances and
the multiplicity of connected devices. This development could
potentially marginalize the position of operators such as Orange, for
which the direct relationship with customers adds value. Losing part
or all of this direct relationship to other players could affect Orange's
revenues, margins, financial position and outlook.

Orange is exposed to risks of disclosure or inappropriate
modification of data in its possession belonging to stakeholders
other than an individual (natural person) “), in particular as a result
of cyber-attacks.

Orange's activities expose it to risks of loss, disclosure, unauthorized
communication to third parties or inappropriate modification of data
stored on its infrastructures or carried by its networks, belonging to
third parties other than individuals, such as business customers or
government authorities, suppliers or partners, or any other third party
or economic player.

These risks may materialize (i) from the implementation of new services
or applications, (ii) from the development of new activities in the field
of connected devices, (iii) from malicious acts (such as cyber-attacks)
particularly aimed at data in Orange's possession, or (iv) possible
negligence or errors within Orange or the Group's outsourcing partners.

Should these risks materialize, the Group's liability may be invoked
andits reputation considerably affected, which would have a significant
impact on its future earnings.

Orange’s strategy of diversification to find new sources of growth
may fail to bring the expected returns and Orange may be
undermined by a business model or a disruptive innovation to
which it is unable to adapt.

Orange's strategy is to diversify its business with a particular focus on
mobile financial services (including Mobile Banking), connected objects
and cybersecurity. Although building on the Group's strengths (digital
expertise, distribution power, capacity for innovation and brand image),

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

Risk factors

the development of these new businesses requires substantial
resources, without any guarantee that the corresponding services will
gain sufficient traction to generate a return on these investments.

In addition, the development of innovations and of divergent business
models to which Orange may fail to adapt sufficiently quickly could
cause it to lose market share and undermine its profitability and future
results.

The brand policy combined with a strategy of geographic
expansion and diversification into new businesses represents an
image risk for the Orange brand.

Orange has chosen growth drivers that are not necessarily in its
traditional core business (such as Mobile Banking, cyber security), or
even carrying out its business as a telecommunications operator in
emerging markets where the political and economic context may be
volatile. Although the Group pays close attention to preserving the
value of the Orange brand, which constitutes a major asset, operational
implementation risks could adversely affect the Company's image, in

2.1.2 Legal risks

Orange operates in highly regulated markets and its business
activities and results could be materially affected by legislative
orregulatory changes, including those with extraterritorial scope,
or by changes in government policy.

In most countries in which it operates, Orange has little flexibility to
manage its business activities as it must comply with various regulatory
obligations governing the provision of its products and services,
primarily relating to obtaining and renewing telecommunication
licenses, as well as to oversight by authorities seeking to maintain
effective competition in the electronic communications markets.
Furthermore, Orange faces regulatory constraints in some countries
as a result of its historically dominant position in the fixed
telecommunications market.

Orange's business activities and profits may be materially adversely
affected by legislative or regulatory changes, sometimes of an
extraterritorial nature, or by changes to government policy, and in
particular by decisions taken by regulatory or competition authorities
in connection with:

= amendment or renewal on unfavorable conditions, or even
withdrawal, of fixed-line or mobile operator licenses;

conditions governing network access (primarily those in connection
with roaming or infrastructure sharing);

service rates;

the introduction of new taxes or increases to existing taxes for
telecommunications companies;

consumerism legislation;

merger policy;

regulations affecting operators of competing sectors, such as cable;

regulations governing data security;

regulation of banking and financial activities and any similar regulations
requiring compliance such as laws and rules on economic sanctions.

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

particular in the mature mobile telephony sector. In the event of
significant damage to the Orange brand, the Group's financial position
and outlook may be affected.

The scope of Orange’s business and the interconnection of the
networks mean that Orange is exposed to a variety of acts of
technical fraud, specific to the telecommunications or mobile
financial services sector.

Orange faces risks of different types of fraud relating to its
telecommunications or mobile financial services, which may affect it
directly, or affect its customers. In a context of increasingly complex
technologies, network virtualization and the faster implementation of
new services or applications, types of fraud that are more difficult to
detect or control may also appear, encouraged by the development
of mass data processing, which increases the scope for possible
attacks, particularly cyber-attacks. Should a serious case of fraud
occur, Orange's revenues, margins, quality of service and reputation
could be affected.

Such decisions could materially affect the Group's revenue and results.

For further information on risks related to regulations, see Section 1.7
Regulation of activities.

Orange is continually involved in disputes, in particular with
regulatory authorities, competitors or government agencies, the
outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on its
results or financial position.

Orange believes that, on a general basis and in all countries in which
it is present, it complies with all the specific regulations in force, as
well as the conditions governing its operator licenses. However, the
Company is not able to predict the decisions of oversight and legal
authorities who are regularly asked to rule on such issues. Should
Orange be ordered by the relevant authorities in a country in which it
operates, to pay damages or a fine or suspend certain of its activities,
due to non-compliance with an applicable regulation, the Group's
financial position and results could be adversely affected.

In addition, Orange — particularly in France and Poland - is frequently
involved in legal proceedings with its competitors and with the
regulatory authorities due to its dominant position in certain markets,
and the complaints filed against Orange may be substantial. In the
past, the Group has been fined several tens of millions of euros and
even several hundreds of millions of euros for concerted practices or
for abuse of a dominant position. Finally, the Group may be the object
of substantial commercial lawsuits with potentially very significant
penalties. The outcome of lawsuits is inherently unpredictable.

In the case of proceedings involving European Competition Authorities,
the maximum fine provided for by law is 10% of the consolidated
revenue of the company at fault (or the Group to which it belongs, as
the case may be).

The main proceedings involving Orange are detailed in Note 9 Taxes
and Note 16 Litigation to the consolidated financial statements.
Developments in or the results of some or all of the ongoing proceedings
could have a material adverse effect on Orange's results or financial
position.


--- Page 52 ---

2.1.3 Financial risks

Liquidity risk
Orange’s results and outlook could be affected if the terms of
access to capital markets become difficult.

The tightening of prudential rules for the financial sector resulting from
the “Basel Ill" and “Solvency II" regulations which seek to strengthen
the banks and insurance companies’ equity, will compel companies.
to increase the share of their financing from the bond markets.

Orange finances itself mainly through the bond markets. An unfavorable
development in the macroeconomic context could restrict or make
significantly more expensive Orange's access to its usual sources of
financing through an increase in market rates and/or the margins
applied to its borrowings.

Any inability to access the financial markets and/or obtain financing
on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on Orange.
The Group could, in particular, be required to allocate a significant
portion of its available cash to service or pay off debt, to the detriment
of investment or shareholders’ remuneration. In all cases, Orange's
results, cash flows and, more generally, financial position and flexibility
may be adversely affected.

See Note 12.3 Liquidity risk management to the consolidated financial
statements, which sets out, in particular, different financing sources
available to Orange, the maturity of its debt and changes to its credit
rating, as well as Note 12.4 Financial ratios, which contains information
on the limited commitments of the Orange group in relation to financial
ratios and in the event of default or material adverse change.

Risk of asset impairment

Changes affecting the economic, political or regulatory environment
may result in asset impairment, particularly of goodwill.

At December 31, 2018, the gross value of goodwill recognized by
Orange following completed acquisitions and disposals was 32.9 billion
euros, not including the goodwill of associates and joint ventures.

The book values of long-term assets, including goodwill and fixed
assets, are sensitive to any change in the business environment that
is different from the assumptions used. Orange recognizes assets as
impaired if events or circumstances occur that involve material adverse
changes of a permanent nature affecting the economic environment
or the assumptions and targets used at the time of the acquisition.

Over the past five years, Orange recognized significant impairment
losses in respect of its interests in Poland, Congo (DRC), Cameroon
and Egypt. At December 31, 2018, the cumulative amount of goodwill
impairment was 5.8 billion euros, not including the goodwill impairment
of associates and joint ventures.

New events or adverse circumstances could conduct Orange to review
the present value of its assets and to recognize further substantial
impairment that could have an adverse effect on its results.

In addition, in the case of disposals or listings on a stock exchange,
the value of certain subsidiaries could be affected by changes in the
stock and debt markets.

Risk factors and activity management framework — 2

Risk factors

For further information on goodwill and recoverable amounts
(particularly key assumptions and sensitivity), see Note 7 Impairment
and Goodwill and Note 8.2 Impairment of fixed assets to the
consolidated financial statements and Section 3.1.2.2 From Group
adjusted EBITDA to operating income.

Market risks

Interest rate risk

Orange’s business activities could be affected by interest rate
fluctuations.

In the normal course of its business, Orange obtains most of its
funding from capital markets (particularly the bond market) anda small
part from bank loans.

Since most of its current debt is at a fixed rate, Orange has limited
exposure to increases in market interest rates. The Group remains
exposed to a sustained ongoing increase in interest rates for future
financing.

To limit exposure to interest rate fluctuations, Orange from time to time
makes use of financial instruments (derivatives) but cannot guarantee
that these transactions will completely limit its exposure or that suitable
financial instruments will be available at reasonable prices. In the event
that Orange cannot use financial instruments or if its financial instrument
strategy proves ineffective, cash flows and earnings may be adversely
affected.

In addition, the costs of hedging against interest rate fluctuations
could, generally, increase in line with market liquidity, banks’ positions,
and, more broadly, the macroeconomic situation (or how it is perceived
by investors).

The management of interest rate risk and an analysis of the sensitivity
of the Group's position to changes in interest rates are set out in
Note 12.1 Interest rate risk management to the consolidated financial
statements.

Foreign exchange risk

Orange’s results and cash position are exposed to exchange rate
fluctuations.

In general, currency markets remained highly volatile in 2018,
particularly in emerging countries, which has not curbed uncertainty
over exchange rate trends.

The main currencies in which Orange is exposed to a major foreign
exchange risk are the Polish zloty, the Egyptian pound, the US dollar
and the British pound sterling. Intra-period variations in the average
exchange rate of a particular currency could significantly affect the
revenue and expenses denominated in that currency, which would
significantly affect Orange's results, as happened, for example, with
the near 50% devaluation of the Egyptian pound in November 2016.
In addition to the main currencies, Orange operates in other monetary
zones, in particular in Africa & Middle East. Depreciation of the
currencies in this region would have an adverse effect on the Group's
consolidated revenue and earnings. Based on 2018 data, the
theoretical impact of a 10% rise against the euro in the main currencies
in which the Group's subsidiaries operate would reduce consolidated
revenue by 858 million euros (-2.07%) and reported EBITDA by
258 million euros (-2.15%).

2 — Risk factors and activity management framework

Risk factors

When preparing the Group's consolidated financial statements, the
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euros at
the fiscal year closing rate. This translation could have a negative
impact on the consolidated balance sheet, assets and liabilities and
equity, for potentially significant amounts, as well as on net income in
the event of disposal of these subsidiaries.

The management of foreign exchange risk and an analysis of the
sensitivity of the Group's position to changes in foreign exchange rates
are set out in Note 12.2 Foreign exchange risk management to the
consolidated financial statements.

Orange manages the foreign exchange risk on commercial transactions
(stemming from operations) and financial transactions (stemming from
financial debt) in the manner set out in Note 12.2 Foreign exchange
risk management to the consolidated financial statements.

Notably, Orange makes use of derivatives to hedge its exposure to
foreign exchange risk but cannot guarantee that suitable hedging
instruments will be available at reasonable prices.

To the extent that Orange has not used hedging instruments to hedge
part of this risk, its cash flows and results could be affected.

See Note 11.8 Derivatives to the consolidated financial statements.

Credit-rating risks

Achange in the outlook for Orange’s credit rating could increase
its borrowing costs and in certain circumstances Orange’s access
to the capital it needs could be limited.

Orange's credit rating from rating agencies is partly based on factors
over which it has no control, namely conditions affecting the
telecommunications industry in general or conditions affecting certain
countries or regions in which it operates. It may be changed at any
time by the rating agencies, in particular as a result of changing
economic conditions, a downturn in the Group's results or performance

2.1.4 Non-financial risks

The various non-financial risks, included in the scope of Orange's
Consolidated Non-Financial Statement (CNFS) have been identified

and assessed, and are managed using the same methodology used
for operational risks related to its business, legal risks and financial risks.

As part of the CNFS, Orange presents the material employee-related,
environmental and social risks to which its business may give rise,
whether to itself or its stakeholders, as well as corruption risks and
matters relating to combating tax avoidance and to business ethics.
These risks are assessed in line with the Group's materiality matrix.

Combating tax avoidance, food waste and food insecurity, respect for
animal well-being and responsible food practices, were all taken into
account as part of Orange's non-financial risk assessment. However,
they were not considered likely to give rise to risks to the Group's
operations or reputation.

Following cyber-attacks especially, Orange is exposed to risks of
disclosure or inappropriate modification of personal data, in
particular customer data. These risks have increased due to its
diversification into mobile financial services.

With regard to the risk of breaching human rights and fundamental
freedoms, Orange's business activities expose it to risks of loss,

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

or changes to its investor base. A prolonged multi-notch downgrade
in Orange's rating would have a material adverse effect on its results
and financial position.

Credit risk and/or counterparty risk on financial
transactions

The insolvency or deterioration in the financial position of a bank
or other institution with which Orange has a financial agreement
may have a material adverse effect on Orange’s financial position.

In the normal course of its business, Orange uses derivatives to
manage exchange rate and interest rate risks, with financial institutions
as counterparties. Cash collateral is lodged with all bank counterparties
with which the derivatives are contracted. Nevertheless, a residual
credit risk may remain if one or more of these counterparties default
on their commitments.

Moreover, Orange may in future have difficulties using its 6 billion euro
undrawn syndicated credit facility, whose maturity date is 2023, if
several of the banks with which the Company has agreements were
to face liquidity problems or could no longer meet their obligations.

Finally, the investment of its available cash exposes Orange to
counterparty risk if the financial institutions where it has invested
should go bankrupt. See Note 12.5 Credit risk and counterparty risk
management to the consolidated financial statements.

The international banking system is such that financial institutions are
interdependent. As a result, the collapse of a single institution (or even
rumors regarding the financial position of one of them) may increase
the risk for the other institutions, which would increase exposure to
counterparty risk for Orange.

For customer-related credit and counterparty risk, see Note 4.3 Trade
receivables and Note 12.5 Credit risk and counterparty risk
management to the consolidated financial statements.

disclosure, unauthorized communication to third parties or inappropriate
modification of the personal data of its customers, employees or the
general public which are stored on its infrastructures or carried by its
networks. This includes their bank details in particular, which are,
moreover, the basis of Orange’s mobile financial services business.

These risks may notably materialize from (i) the implementation of new
services or applications, (ii) the development of new activities in the
field of connected devices or mobile services, (iii) malicious acts (such
as cyber-attacks) particularly targeting personal data (iv) possible
negligence or errors within Orange or the Group's outsourcing partners.
or (v) government requests without any respect for legal or regulatory
formalities (see below for more information on this last point).

Orange may be held liable in various countries under laws that are
being increasingly tightened (such as the General Data Protection
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, or GDPR) and that
strengthen individual rights and obligations on data processors such
as operators and providers of financial services.

Should these risks materialize, owners of the disclosed or modified
data may incur considerable losses, the Group's liability may be invoked
and its reputation and image substantially affected.


--- Page 54 ---

Orange is exposed to risks of corruption, or behavior by
individuals or groups that does not comply with its business
ethics, or even fraudulent behavior.

Through its activities,as well as those of its suppliers, subcontractors
and partners, all throughout the world, and despite its efforts to reinforce
its anti-corruption policy, Orange may be exposed to or implicated in
matters relating to corrupt practices, or may fall victim to behavior that
is fraudulent or does not comply with the international conventions to
which it is a signatory, to its Code of Ethics, or to its Supplier Code of
Conduct, by persons or businesses with which direct or indirect ties
may be established. Furthermore, specific difficulties or risks relating
tonon-compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations
may arise, particularly if the strengthened internal control system
currently in place proves insufficient. These behaviors may target
Orange directly, its customers, its business relations or its employees.

In any event, the Group's liability may be invoked, and Orange's
revenues, margins, quality of service and reputation could be affected.

In the future, Orange may find it difficult to obtain and retain the
skills needed for its business due to numerous employee
departures and changes in its activities.

The high number of retirements and employees working part-time at
the end of their careers in France as well as the new skills required in
relation to the development of new technologies and the Group's
development priorities in high-demand segments of the employment
market, may affect Orange's capacity to continue its business activities
efficiently and successfully implement its strategy. Should these risks
materialize, Orange's profits and outlook may be affected and some
of the human risks described below may increase.

Orange faces a variety of internal and external human risks
relating to health and safety.

Orange's promise to be a people-oriented and digital employer,
inscribed in the Essentials2020 strategic plan, could be affected by
various human factors related to personal safety, psycho-social risks,
and to increased tensions and social unrest in certain countries or
areas. Should these risks materialize, their consequences may be a
source of physical or psychological incapacity for individuals. These
risks could also slow the roll-out of the Group's strategy and have a
material impact on the Group's image, operations and results.

Exposure to electromagnetic fields of telecommunications
equipment, as well as the excessive or inappropriate use of
telecommunication services and equipment may be potentially
harmful to people’s health.

Following concerns raised in many countries regarding the possible
health risks linked to exposure to electromagnetic fields from
telecommunications equipment, public authorities have in general
approved binding regulations and health authorities have issued various.
usage precautions.

The perception of a risk by the public could lead to a decrease in the
number of customers and in their usage, lower consumption per
customer, an increase in lawsuits, particularly against the installation
of mobile antennas, difficulties in opening new sites, thus jeopardizing
the deployment of 5G networks, and the tightening of regulations,
with, as a consequence, a reduction in coverage areas, deterioration
of service quality and an increase in network roll-out costs.

Risk factors and activity management framework — 2

Risk factors

Consensus exists among health experts and health authorities,
including the World Health Organization (WHO), that, so far, no health
risks from exposure to electromagnetic fields below the limits
recommended by the specialist international commission (ICNIRP)
have been identified. Nevertheless, further scientific studies must be
conducted on certain frequencies used for 5G (millimeter waves).
Orange cannot predict the findings of future scientific research or
future studies by international organization and scientific committees
called upon to examine these issues. If an adverse health effect should
one day be scientifically established, this would have a significant
impact on Orange's business, its brand image and the income and
financial position of the Group. Beyond potential impacts on Orange,
this could significantly curb the development of the digital society.

Similarly, the widespread availability of connected digital equipment
may give rise to excessive use, which could have negative physical
(disrupted circadian rhythm, eye strain, issues relating to a sedentary
lifestyle, etc.) and mental (behavioral addiction) consequences for
users, particularly young adults and children. It also increases the risk
of exposure to inappropriate content, cyber bullying and
misinformation, as well as the risk of information overload.

Should this widespread availability be perceived as a risk for the most
vulnerable populations, it may also result for Orange in a decrease in
the use of its services and damage to its reputation. Socially, the
perception of this risk may result in mistrust of digital tools and may
curb innovation.

The scope of Orange’s business activities, its numerous locations
around the world, and its business dealings with a variety of
partners may expose the Group to a risk of breaching human
rights and fundamental freedoms.

Through its activities, as well as those of its suppliers and
subcontractors all throughout the world, Orange may be exposed to
breaches of human rights and fundamental freedoms (such as forced
labor, infringement of the rights of children, non-decent or discriminatory
working conditions, obstruction of freedoms of association or
expression, or invasion of privacy), involving third parties with whom
a direct or indirect link may be established.

Should these risks materialize, they may have for Orange or for
offenders with whom an established business relationship exists, a
significant impact on their image and reputation, and may result in their
liability being invoked.

Inaddition, Orange may be required, in the countries where it operates,
to comply with injunctions from local authorities that do not comply
with the formal legal or regulatory requirements. These injunctions may
involve suspending (totally, partially, or in a certain region) the operation
of certain networks operated by Orange, or intercepting
communications, or disclosing personal data to third parties.
Complying with such injunctions may therefore undermine freedom of
expression or fundamental freedoms.

Should Orange fail to ensure compliance with applicable legislation or
regulations, these injunctions may significantly impact the image or
reputation of Orange or the countries concerned. For civil society or
the targets of these requests, they may also involve breaching freedom
of expression and respect for privacy.

Activity’s control and Risk management framework

The nature of its services and the development of new
technologies may jeopardize the commitments made by Orange
with regard to reducing its environmental impacts.

Due to the nature of its services and its social reach, Orange must
offer new solutions to reduce the environmental impact of its customers,
while limiting its own sources of environmental pollution and
implementing the principles of the circular economy, particularly with
regard to waste management. Orange has committed to reducing
its CO, emissions per customer by 50% by 2020, based on its 2006
emissions figures. Should its environmental action plans prove

2.2.1

The Group Audit, Control and Risk Management Department (DACRG)
reports to the Delegate Chief Executive Officer in charge of Finance,
Performance and Europe. It gathers within a single body the following
functions: Internal Audit, Risk Management, General Control, Credit
Management, Internal Control, Fraud, and Revenue Assurance.

Its role is to define, deploy, manage and assess the Group's risk
management and activities’ control system on behalf of Senior
Management with a view to providing integrated assurance that offers
the best balance between risks and opportunities, which truly
addresses operational needs and concerns, by building on a team of
experts and co-designing innovative approaches, in cooperation with
the other teams responsible for Group risk management, while
preserving audit independence.

At the heart of the Group's challenges and strategy, the DACRG
provides this integrated assurance by supporting changes in the
Group's activities. To this end, its role is to preserve revenue (collection,

revised Afep-Medef Code of June 2018.

Group Audit, Control and Risk Management

improve risk management and thus create value through improvement
initiatives.

Internal control's continuous improvement process can, for example,
be seen in:

= updates of the fraud prevention processes for which updated
modules are distributed on a regular basis;

risk management training for Directors and Chief Executive Officers
of subsidiaries;

= the focusing of audit work on the Group's main risks;

= and by publishing the policies and practices defined and identified
in the Orange Internal Control Book (see section on Internal Control
below), which may be supported by a self-assessment process
covering the main activities, in order to enable entities to compare
themselves against the levels of control and practices expected by
the Group.

The DACRG coordinates internal control reviews involving Executive
Committee members, with the internal control functions of the


--- Page 56 ---

organization's divisions. They are designed to provide assurance that
the internal control system is effective, namely that the main risks have
been identified and the appropriate steps taken to limit their potential
impact. Internal control reviews are part of the integrated assurance
between operational functions and functions in charge of risk
management.

The ACR (Audit, Control, and Risk) community, which includes all
persons involved in these functions within the Group, has a charter
signed by the Chairman and CEO defining the framework of the
missions steered by the DACRG. The integrated assurance process
(synergies among the local and central Audit, Control, and Risk
functions, and with operational departments) is thus strengthened to
meet the Company's targets. Within the context of the Essentials2020
strategic plan, the ACR community and DACRG have grown stronger
so as to drive international business growth as well as diversification,
particularly into mobile financial services.

The DACRG's activities are in line with best practices promoted by the
Institut francais de |'Audit et du Contrdle Interne (IFAC!) and the
Association pour le Management des Risques et des Assurances de
|'Entreprise (AMRAE).

ISO 9001 Quality Certification for DACRG

In July 2018, the DACRG’s ISO 9001 certification (2015 version) was
renewed by AFAQ/AFNOR. This quality approach contributes to the
improvement and simplification of all processes in order to adopt best
practices that meet the requirements of our stakeholders. It is in line
with the DACRG’s goal to become a “trusted business partner” by
providing integrated assurance. DACRG's management team sets
quality targets and assesses its results against these targets.

Group Internal Audit

Group Internal Audit has around 70 qualified auditors working as a
shared service for all Group entities. They are for the most part located
in France. Group Internal Audit comprises teams dedicated to the IT
system, the networks and financial services. It cooperates with the
local audit teams, in accordance with their governance rules: sharing
of audit plans, follow-up of recommendations, joint audits,
methodological exchanges. This mainly involves operator subsidiaries
that are not 100% controlled (in Europe in particular Orange Polska
and Orange Belgium, and in Africa in particular the Sonatel Group).

Group Internal Audit and Orange Polska’s Internal Audit are certified
on an annual basis by IFAC! Certification, based on the professional
guidelines for internal audits (RPAI in French). Issues may be referred
directly to Group Internal Audit by the Chairman of the Audit Committee
or by the Chairman and CEO. The Director of Group Audit is authorized
to directly inform the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee.

Each year, the audit plan is endorsed by the Risk Committee and
approved by the Audit Committee. An annual report, with the main
results and findings, is also presented to the Risk Committee and then
the Audit Committee.

The joint operation with Deutsche Telekom (Buyin) is subject to audits
conducted jointly by the Orange group’s and Deutsche Telekom's
Internal Audit Departments.

By means of its audit assignments, Internal Audit helps the Group to
maintain an appropriate management control system by assessing its
effectiveness and efficiency and by formulating remarks and
recommendations for its ongoing improvement. The recommendations
arising from internal audit assignments are systematically monitored
and lead in particular to action plans that are drawn up and implemented
by the Group's divisions and subsidiaries. These assignments include,
among others, checks performed at the request of the Group's Internal
Control Department as part of the systematic assessment of internal
financial control, particularly tests of the operating effectiveness of the

Risk factors and activity management framework — 2

Activity’s control and Risk management framework

internal control system and cyclical audits performed on the internal
control system of smaller subsidiaries. Internal Audit also contributes
to the approach of risk identification, assessment and processing
through the results of its audit assignments and its recommendations.

Risk Management

The Group’s Risk Management department defines the Group's risk
management strategy and deploys its approach in this field, as part
of the integrated approach promoted by the ACR charter:

= it leads the risk identification and assessment processes on behalf
of the Group Executive Committee’s Risk Committee (see
Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance
committees);

= itmonitors the corresponding action plans by calling on the network
of risk managers at entities and subsidiaries;

= it provides support to all Group entities in the preparation of all kinds
of risk mapping activities, in particular in cooperation with the
Group's Corporate Social Responsibility Department for extra-
financial risks;

= it plans for risks associated with the strategic plan, including those
relating to new growth activities, in cooperation with the Group’s
Strategy Department.

Each risk is defined as a potential event, the consequences of which,
should these risks materialize, would prevent Orange or one of its
entities from carrying out its assignments, fulfilling its commitments or
achieving its objectives, and could affect Orange's employees, assets,
profits and financial position, the environment, or the Group or entity's
reputation. The various sources of risk identification are a combination
of the views of Directors and Officers of the operating entities. The
cause analysis complements and refines the description of the event
and influences the risk probability level. The context analysis makes it
possible to characterize the risk in each particular situation, to fine-
tune its causes and consequences, and to assess the probability and
impacts of the risk in a way that is suited to the area of the organization
where the risk is identified. Their inclusion in risk mapping reflects the
principle of the prevalence in impact analysis (consequence-related)
or the probability analysis (cause-related).

The Group’s management teams identify and assess, at least once a
year, the risks falling within their remit. Risk mapping also includes a
description of action plans designed to address these risks by
strengthening internal control. This forms the cornerstone on which
the control systems are built.

The list of significant events, the changes to risk mapping and the
monitoring of action plans are scrutinized during internal control reviews
of each Department.

At Group level, risks are monitored by the Group Executive Committee's
Risk Committee. The overall risk Management Report is reviewed at
least once a year by this Risk Committee and presented to the Directors
at a joint meeting of the Board of Directors’ committees, during which
major risks are discussed in the presence of the directors concerned.
This approach includes a review of all of the risks described in
Section 2.1 Risk factors in this document.

General Control

General Control involves, at the request of Executive Committee
members or their respective management committees, or following a
report from the ethics whistleblowing mechanism, investigations on
matters involving employees that may run counter to the Group's
interests. These matters may involve instances of fraud, conflicts of
interest, damage to Group assets, behavioral problems and in general
any acts by employees that conflict with Group rules. In this respect,
General Control works in a complementary manner to the various

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

59

Activity’s control and Risk management framework

departments within the DACRG as well as to Group General Inspection.
General Control is represented in France by investigation units and at
Group level for international cases by general controllers. Certain
countries like Poland, Spain, Romania and Senegal established
dedicated internal units that work closely with General Control.

Credit Management

The Group's Credit Management Department is charged with
minimizing the financial risks associated with the credit granted to our
customers. Its purpose is to have a consolidated vision of the credit
risks with our clients and partners (quarterly credit committee) and to
implement tools that allow these risks to be managed. In order to do
this, it depends on local teams or contacts and on the processes in
place in each operational entity.

It disseminates the culture of credit management within the Group and
facilitates the sharing and circulation of information.

Internal control

Group Internal Control draws up and implements the Internal Control
strategy within the Group. To this end, it defines a methodology, a
process and the necessary tools for its application. It rolls them out
annually, particularly as regards:

= the updating and distribution of a set of policies and practices
defined by the Group with the relevant Group functions and domains,
Orange IC Book;

the internal control self-assessment program, on the bases of the
Orange IC Book among others; the aim is to identify the main
improvements required to the internal control system and to
implement corrective actions. Where necessary, internal audits allow
to make sure of the self-assessment findings and the relevance of
the action plans;

= Sarbanes-Oxley certification for financial internal control.

Group Internal Control coordinates the local internal control functions.
and the persons in charge of the control environment domains, giving
them support and advice to ensure the quality and the control of their
system. The role of the local internal control functions is to assist the
operating managers of their entities, in order to help them structure
and maintain an efficient internal control system, which meets both
their own and the Group's requirements. Within their own entity, they
apply the risk and activity management directives issued by the Group,
and ensure the smooth running of the system at their own level.

Group Internal Control agrees to an annual action and evaluation
program for each of these scopes (areas, divisions, and entities),
which is rolled out locally. It supports the departments with internal
control assignments designed to provide reasonable assurance that
activities are properly controlled in a number of areas (e.g. compliance
with laws and regulations, governance, operational or decision-making
processes, integration of new entities, etc.).

Among its recurring actions, it provides monitoring for governance
committee heads (see Section 5.2.2.3 Group Executive Committee
and governance committees) and coordinates the organization of
internal control reviews involving Executive Committee members, with
the support of the DACRG, the Group Security Department, and
Group Compliance.

Working with the Mobile Finance Division, the internal control
departments at the other divisions and entities, and Internal Audit and

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

the Compliance Department, the Group Internal Control Department
has ensured that the Internal Control system is appropriate for
controlling activities and meeting our regulatory obligations (against
money laundering and terrorist financing, banking obligations).

The internal control evaluation is presented to the Group Risks
Committee and then to the Audit Committee.

Fraud and Revenue Assurance

Revenue recognition in the telecommunications industry is based on
data capture, involving various components of network
access — managing and collecting uses -, recovery via the IT
systems — supporting the customer bases and recovery of individual
items -, and recording via the accounting and_ financial
systems — supporting the production of financial statements. The
complexity of this technical and commercial architecture has led
Orange, through its Fraud and Revenue Assurance Department, to
develop its own revenue protection strategy; this is underpinned by a
methodology ensuring the correct measurement, substance,
comprehensiveness and valuation of the individual elements
underpinning our customer invoicing, through a risk-oriented overview
of the entire process chain.

Group Fraud and Revenue Assurance (GFRA) also defines the Group's
strategy and approach to fraud prevention and detection, as well as
to the assurance of revenue. To support the deployment of this strategy,
GFRA works very closely with their Internal Control and Risk
Management colleagues, along with other corporate and local entity
teams.

Orange has adopted an approach based on anticipation and risk
analysis to manage fraud. GFRA constantly monitors existing and
emerging risks of fraud, as well as any new fraud-related legislation.
This enables Orange to adapt its anti-fraud strategy accordingly. GFRA
maintains the Group's fraud risk map, which covers all anticipated
risks in this domain (including, for example, fraud in the financial
statements, technical (cyber) fraud, identity theft and social engineering
fraud, missing trader VAT carousels, and combating terrorist financing
and money laundering).

Orange has preventative controls in place to reduce the probability of
frauds which may constitute a major risk.

Since prevention cannot be 100% effective, the Group has also defined
acontrol framework designed to detect instances of fraud. Any cases
or suspicions identified through these controls are investigated and
are processed in compliance with the law and our ethical standards.

Orange believes that in order to manage fraud risk and to assure
revenue, the cost of fraud and revenue leakage must be managed at
a local level and consolidated at Group level, allowing major incidents
to be analyzed and treated, and any emerging trends identified. With
regard to the production of Group financial information, the approach
defined by GFRA includes such applicable risks as frauds committed
by management or fraud within the financial statements.

Detecting fraud is the responsibility of management, which is assisted
by GFRA and local fraud detection specialists in the Group entities.

A Group whistleblowing mechanism is in place, as provided for under
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the so-called “Sapin II" Law of December 9,
2016 and the French Law of March 27, 2017 relating to the duty of
care of parent companies and contracting companies. This system is
presented in Section 2.2.4.1.2.

When internal fraud is strongly suspected, investigations are generally
entrusted to specialized services, in particular to General Control.
Investigation services are responsible for establishing the existence of
facts. In the event of internal fraud, Company management determines.
the penalties. For all cases detected (internal or external fraud), the
civil, criminal, or legal consequences are considered after the
recommendations of the Company's Legal Department.

2.2.2

The Orange Group's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities
are coordinated by a dedicated team, reporting to the Senior Executive
Vice-President, Corporate Social Responsibility, Diversity, Partnerships
and Inclusiveness. She regularly reports to Orange’s Executive
Committee and Board of Directors, through the work of the Governance
and Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSER), on
the Group's actions and guidelines in the areas of corporate, social
and environmental responsibility (including climate change). Some of
the main items presented to the GCSER include the CSR strategy and
road map, the Group's vigilance plan and its progress report, and the
Consolidated Non Financial Statement (CNFS). Orange will be
strengthening its governance in terms of sustainable performance, by
creating a Committee led by members of the Group's Executive
Committee.

The CSR Departmentis itself organized by business areas (Responsible
Marketing, Corporate & Social Issues, Environment) and cross-
functional departments (Communication, Transformation &
Operations). It relies on a network of CSR managers, coordinated by
the Group CSR team, who contribute to the operational deployment
of this approach.

Based on constructive listening to the Group’s stakeholders, and an
internal culture that promotes innovation, the commitment as corporate

2.2.3

The specific internal financial control procedures relate to the
preparation and treatment of accounting and financial information,
and the work on internal control carried out pursuant to section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, an insurance policy translates
certain operational risks into financial commitments.

2.2.3.1 Specific internal control procedures
pertaining to the preparation

and processing of accounting

and financial information

The Group Accounting Department and Group Management Control
Department, which also report to the Chief Executive Officer Finance,
Performance and Europe, play a decisive role in the internal control
system.

The Group Accounting and Group Controlling Departments have the
following key duties:

= producing the Group's consolidated financial statements and the
statutory financial statements for Orange SA and certain French
subsidiaries within time frames that meet financial market
requirements and legal obligations while guaranteeing that the
statements provide a true and fair view of the Company in
compliance with the accounting policies adopted by the Group;

Risk factors and activity management framework — 2

Activity’s control and Risk management framework

Fraud cases are analyzed by GFRA in order to assess control measures
and therefore better prevent and detect similar fraud cases, in an effort
to ensure continuous improvement.

A summary report on fraud prevention and detection is reviewed at
least once a year by the Group Risks Committee and presented at a
joint meeting to the Board of Directors’ committees.

Group Corporate Social Responsibility

citizen gives the same meaning to all the activities: making the most
of digital technology to drive progress for all. An integral part of the
Group's strategy, the CSR policy mobilizes its subsidiaries around
three drivers of sustainable performance: building the confidence of
customers, supporting local economic and social development in
each territory and managing environmental balance.

Orange implements the principles of inclusion, materiality and
responsiveness as defined in the AA1000 APS (2008), the international
reference for Corporate Social Responsibility that focuses on taking
stakeholders’ requirements into account. The Group also takes into
account the principles defined by the ISO 26000 standard on Corporate
Social Responsibility, as well as the guidelines set out by the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI) standard, and aligns its publications with the
recommendations of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial
Disclosures).

To ensure the reliability of indicators and manage the proper
implementation of the Group's commitments in its various business
units, Orange has carried out an external verification of its CSR policy
and achievements by one of its Statutory Auditors for several years,
in order to obtain a reasonable assurance report on selected CSR
information (see Section 4.7 Report by one of the Statutory Auditors).

Specific financial internal control procedures

= preparing the management reports on the statutory and
consolidated financial statements and producing the necessary
documentation for financial communication of results and the
summary of management reporting for the Executive Committee;

= managing the monthly and quarterly reporting cycle allowing
management to measure the Group's performance on a regular
basis;

designing and implementing Group methods, procedures and
standards frames for Accounting and Management Controlling;

= identifying and carrying out the necessary changes to the Group's
accounting and financial information systems.

Within these departments, the internal control of accounting and
financial information is organized around the following elements:

= the Disclosure Committee (see Section 5.2.2.3);

= the Group Accounting and Controlling function;

= unified accounting and management reporting; and
= Group-wide accounting standards and methods.

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

2 — Risk factors and activity management framework

Activity’s control and Risk management framework

Unified accounting and management reporting

All of the Group's entities participate in the Group’s management and
monitoring cycle, which is composed of three basic components:

= the forecasting process (plan, budget, and periodic internal
provisions);

= the process for producing statutory accounts and the Group's
consolidated financial statements; and

= the management reporting process.

The forecasting process
(plan, budget, and periodic internal provisions)

The Group budgeting process requires regular updates of internal
projections and management's involvement. It is worked out by country
and division, business unit, and Group subsidiary.

The budget must reflect the Group’s ambitions at each level of the
organization. It includes a yearly goal based on year one of the multi-
year plan and forecasts that are updated in May, including an updated
second-half goal, and in October-November to better evaluate target
figures for year-end.

The budget dossier is composed of:

= packages of financial data, along with comments summarizing, in
particular, major actions;

= capital expenditure by project;
= an analysis of risks and opportunities.

As part of the budget process, the divisions establish and analyze the
performance indicators. The budget is established on a monthly basis
So to be used as a reference for the Group's monthly reporting.

Moreover, the Group draws up a multi-year plan with the main Group
entities, setting out the medium-term financial trajectories for the
Group and its main entities.

Process of preparing the companies’ statutory financial
statements and the Group’s consolidated financial
statements

The financial statements of Orange are prepared in accordance with
the following principles:

= performing a pre-closing of accounts at the end of May and the end
of November;

= anticipating the use of estimates and the treatment of complex
accounting operations;

= and formalizing closing processes and schedules.

As such, documenting the processes leading to the production of
financial information up to the filling of consolidation packages
constitutes a common framework for all contributors, thus
‘strengthening internal control within the accounting and management
controlling function.

Instructions from the Consolidation department specifying the process
and agreed timeline for each closing are circulated within the Group,
and then broken down by subsidiary.

Consolidation packages are created monthly by each entity of the
Group, according to IFRS accounting policies, and entered in the
Group's consolidation and reporting tool.

The Group's principles, when they are compatible with the local rules
applicable to the statutory financial statements, prevail, in order to limit
subsequent restatements. However, in the event that principles
inconsistent with those of the Group are applied in an entity's statutory

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

financial statements and have a significant impact on measuring
earnings and assets, the entity restates those items for consistency.

Identification, regular measurement, and reconciliation of accounting
methods between statutory financial statements and Group standards.
are the responsibility of each entity.

The identification and assessment of unrecognized contractual
commitments are covered by a specific report drawn up annually by
the Legal and Finance Departments, working in close collaboration.
The main contractual and regulatory commitments made by the Group,
likely to have a material impact on its financial position, are made
known the Claims and Commitments Committee (see Section 5.2.2.3
Executive Committee and Group governance committees).

Management reporting process

The reporting process is a major element in the control and financial
information process. It is a major tool for monitoring, controlling, and
for the Group's General Management. The reconciliation of accounting
and forecast data, along with the monthly review at each level of the
Group contributes to the quality and accuracy of the information
produced. This method, established by the Controlling and Accounting
Departments, is repeated in all entities of the Group and at each level
of the organization (business unit, division and Group).

The definition of Group report contents and media that are used to
track the achievement of Group objectives is established on a regular
and consistent basis. The financial data in reporting come primarily
from the Group consolidation and reporting tool, and the reporting
formats are standardized. The reports are validated by the country
financial controllers.

This reporting allows to track the Group's management and
performance indicators, and is articulated around the following:

= amonthly performance chart aiming to provide the Chairman and
CEO and the Executive Committee with the key operating indicators
for the Group and the major events and alerts for the month;

= monthly reports broken down by published segment, line of
business, and country; these include financial and operating
indicators.

Business reviews at the Executive Committee level are organized by
country under the authority of the Delegate CEO in charge of Finance,
Performance and Europe. Their purpose is to pilot the activity and
review the updated end-of-year forecast. These monthly reviews are
attended by the Group Finance Department with the country’s Manager
and finance function. The Chairman and CEO participates in the
quarterly reviews. These reviews are based on a formalized report
structure. Gathering of information for these reports is organized for
each country according to the Group's reporting instructions.

Group-wide accounting standards and methods

In order to draw up projected and actual consolidated statements, the
Group has opted for the unification principle which implies:

= homogeneity of the reference system, the accounting methods and
consolidation rules;

= the standardization of reporting formats;

= and the use of a common consolidation and reporting application
within the Group.

Within the Group's Accounting Department, the Department of
Accounting Principles is responsible for defining and disseminating
the Group’s accounting policies under IFRS standards. It also keeps
an eye on norms evolution and formalizes on a systematic and
structured basis the IFRS Group accounting policies through the


--- Page 60 ---

Group's accounting manual, closing instructions, and information or
training meetings.

This system is completed by the existence of accounting principles
correspondents in the countries and divisions. It identifies accounting
problems encountered locally, disseminates the Group's accounting
policies in divisions, countries, entities and accounts departments and
ensures that the training needs of personnel with responsibility for the
efficient application of the Group’s accounting policies are met.

ISO 9001 Quality Certification
for the Accounting Department

Since 2001, Orange SA has obtained the ISO 9001 v2000 standard
certification in the area of ISO Management for accounting services in
France, issued by AFAQ/AFNOR. Since 2007, all of the departments
in the Group Accounting Department based in France have received
ISO 9001 v2000 certification. It was decided that, starting from 2010,
the process for the ISO 9001 v2008 and V2015 standard awarded by
AFNOR would be renewed for new three-year certification cycles.

This approach allows for each accounting process, to look for ways
of improving, simplifying, and adopting best practices, so that the
financial statements can be produced in a timely manner and so that
they meet satisfactorily the regulatory quality standards.

The management of the accounting function annually clarifies quality
targets, namely: improving the performance and services provided,
building its partners’ trust, and increasing the professional standards
of all involved.
2.2.3.2 Summary of works on Internal

Control implemented under

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

Because it is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Orange is subject
to the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

In accordance with the provisions of Article 404 of this Act, the
Chairman and CEO and the Delegate CEO in charge of Finance,
Performance and Europe must prepare a report in which they make
a statement about the effectiveness of internal controls in the
production of the Group's financial statements, prepared in accordance
with IFRS standards and presented in the Annual Report (Form 20-F)
that is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the
United States. The Statutory Auditors make their own internal control
evaluation. The Management and Statutory Auditors Reports appear
annually in the Annual Report on Form 20-F.

To better meet the requirements of Article 404 of the Act, Orange,
under the Group's Internal Control Department, implements a
permanent program to reinforce the internal control culture across the
entire Group.

By applying standards issued by the SEC, Orange is targeting its
internal financial control system on significant risk areas, enabling it to
be more relevant and more effective and to limit the Group's
assessments to the controls covering these risk areas.

Where the reliability of its financial information is concerned, Orange
relies on an internal control organization based on the internationally
recognized framework of the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Orange classifies
the five component parts of the COSO under two headings:

= control environment (governance committees, overall policies and
procedures); and

= operational control (flows and processes).

The annual work program, which covers the control environment and

Risk factors and activity management framework — 2

Activity’s control and Risk management framework

the operational control, is made up of the following main actions,
based on the risks that have been identified:

= identification of consolidation scope: Group Governance
Committees, as well as areas relevant to the control environment
and consolidated entities, whose scope is in line with the audit of
the financial statements;

= scoping: identification by entity of the areas relevant to the control
environment as well as flows and information systems supporting
these flows;

= documentation on the internal control system implemented and the
assessment of its effectiveness.

The Group has excluded from the scope of its assessment of internal
control over financial reporting the operations and related assets of
the following entities acquired in 2018: Business & Decision group,
Basefarm group, Enovacom group and Republica de Comunicaciones
Moviles. These entities are included in the 2018 consolidated financial
statements of the Group and constitute 0.4% of the total revenue and
0.2% of the total assets.

Financial internal control’s assessment work takes into account the
internal audit work and risk management analyses, as well as work on
fraud (prevention, detection, and investigations).

Furthermore, the Statutory Auditors carry out an independent
evaluation of the financial internal control system.

The evaluation for the 2018 fiscal year did not reveal any material
weakness. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Delegate
Chief Executive Officer in charge of Finance, Performance and Europe
therefore noted the operational effectiveness of the internal control
system relating to the preparation of the financial statements.

2.2.3.3

As part of its insurance policy, Orange has negotiated an insurance
plan with the insurance and reinsurance market to cover its main risks.
It is based on programs that are regularly reviewed as part of calls for
tenders organized to select brokers and insurers.

Insurance

This insurance plan is designed to optimize the terms of transfer,
based on the quality of coverage offered and its cost. In addition to
this objective, there is also a security objective, which takes the form
of a contractual, required level of solvency for participants, which is
essential to their continued participation in the subscribed insurance
program.

This insurance plan reflects the nature of the Orange Group's risks,
and is adapted to the capacities offered by the markets to international
companies of comparable size operating in similar business sectors.
The suitability of the Group's existing programs in meeting its needs
is confirmed by the publication of regular studies and benchmarks.

This policy has also made it possible to expand the scope of insurance
coverage to nearly all of the Group's subsidiaries (>90% of revenues.
Subsidiaries have been gradually integrated into the insurance umbrella
taking into account the regulatory changes affecting the regional
locations of our assets and activities.

In addition, the insurance policy in place includes a risk management
strategy designed to identify any Group vulnerabilities and implement
preventive actions in line with the development of the Group's business,
sites and environment. It organizes regular visits to Orange's main sites
in France and abroad, in partnership with the engineering of our
insurers and brokers, which reinforces this strategy.

The transformation of a primarily telecoms business into a multi-
services operator generates new risks, requiring it to constantly adapt
financing in line with the nature of the business activities, as well as

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

constant revaluation. Our insurers and service providers are informed
of these developments through periodic discussions.

Furthermore, the Group Insurance Division works with the relevant
Group entities, providing expertise and support for contractual loss
prevention techniques written into agreements with customers and
suppliers.

The main insurance policies that make up the current plan are designed
to protect against the following risks:

= risks of damage to property and substantial financial losses and
technology risks;

= third-party and customer civil liability risks incurred during the
management of the Company and the performance of its activities;

= risks associated with the Company's vehicle fleets.

The risk of damage to the telephone poles and open-wire lines of the
overhead fixed-line network due to natural disasters remain self-
insured. The resulting financial expenses are monitored in consultation
with the Group's in-house experts and the relevant broker. Regarding
these expenses, the Group does not consider the case has been
made for an alternative financial structuring of these risks, and the

2.2.4

The specific internal control procedures presented below, together
with the policies and measures in place, help reduce the risks identified
by the Group in the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement (CNFS)
and the vigilance plan. They are presented under five overarching
themes:

= the impact of our activities in terms of respect of human rights and
fundamental freedoms;

= the employment-related consequences of the business;

the social consequences of our activities;

= the environmental impacts of our activities;

= the management framework for suppliers and subcontractors.

2.2.4.1 Impacts of our activities
in terms of respect of human rights

and fundamental freedoms

The framework for controlling breaches of human rights and
fundamental freedoms aims to prevent non-financial risks relating to:

the inappropriate disclosure or modification, by Orange or its
business contacts, of the personal data of customers or other third
parties, notably during cyber-attacks;

exposure to risks of corruption, or behavior by individuals or groups
that does not comply with its business ethics, or even fraudulent
behavior;

the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms by Orange
or its business relations.

2.2.4.1.1 Protecting Personal Data

The protection of personal data benefits from the general framework
for data protection implemented by Orange; moreover, Orange
undertakes to ensure that personal data is processed securely and in
a confidential manner for previously identified and proportionate
purposes, including when activities are carried out by subcontractors.

Data protection is subject to a Security Policy that is regularly updated
according to the level of threat and changes in the environment, with
the aim of continuously improving security by managing and assessing
risks (notably cyber risks), specifically to mitigate the impact of incidents
or even crises.

The governance of the Group's overall security is under the
responsibility of the Senior Executive Vice-President, Strategy and

traditional markets (insurance and reinsurance) do not offer an adequate
risk transfer solution.

Specific policies are negotiated and set up, including:

= assistance for employees on business trips or who are expatriated;
= work site insurance (real-estate or construction projects);
= new activities (financial activities, banking).

The total cost of insurance cover provided by the Orange group
program in 2018 amounted to approximately 0.04% of revenue for the
fiscal year.

Moreover, through its self-brokerage insurance firm, the Group
contributes to the design of programs to enrich the products and
services offered to customers.

The Group Insurance Division's management process, which involves
various outside parties (consultants and brokers) at different stages,
encompasses internal controls including the control environment,
governance and ethics. Some of these areas have been assessed by
the Group's internal and external auditors to verify their compliance
with internal control procedures.

Framework for controlling non-financial risks

Cyber Security. It is implemented by the Group Security Department
under his authority.

International standards, such as ISO 27001 for information security
and ISO 27008 for risk analysis, guide the actions and the Group has.
several certifications to reinforce the protection of Orange’s assets and
those of its customers.

The technical and organizational mechanisms derived from the Global
Security Policy are formalized in the Group Security Standard, which
focuses on the essential security requirements designed to be applied
throughout the Group.

Seminars (physical security, information security, crisis management
and business continuity) are organized on an annual basis with the
European and African countries. Review meetings are organized on
an annual basis between the Group Security Director and members
of the Executive Committee.

Several security monitoring centers also constantly monitor the
differences between security policies and alerts that may be triggered
in the event of suspect activities. These alerts are analyzed and
remediation procedures are monitored according to the level of criticality.

In addition to the rules defined by the Group Security Standard, Orange
has defined:

= aCrisis Management Policy;

= aGroup Security Policy for personal data which takes into account
changes in the European regulatory framework;

= aresponse procedure for personal data security events/incidents;
= a Personal Data Security Guide;

= Orange's Sensitive Data Security Guide which presents the basic
rules and safety actions to be complied with in order to identify
sensitive data and secure it completely, throughout its life time.

All these documents are sent by the Group Security Director to the
community of security managers in the entities as well as to the
Group's Executive Vice-Presidents.

In parallel with the Group’s Security Policy, the entry into force of the
European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from May 25,
2018, enabled the deployment of an appropriate compliance approach
specifically in the Group's European entities, that takes into account
arisk-based approach as promoted by this new regulatory framework.


--- Page 62 ---

Alongside the Group's Security Policy, this approach contributes to
creating the conditions to mitigate the risks in relation to personal data
processed by Orange. Beyond the entities immediately and directly
concerned by this new European regulation, entities outside of the
European Union have benefited from awareness-raising on this subject,
even where there are no regulations in this area. It is possible that the
regulatory environment may change in several countries.

AGroup-level structure and governance arrangements have, therefore,
been put in place to deal with data protection risks in the entities. The
European regulation has made the office of Data Protection Officer key
in organizations, basing it on existing practices such as the role of
Correspondant Informatique et Libertés (CIL) (data protection
correspondent) in France since 2006. In this context, Orange had
appointed a Data Protection Correspondent in France in 2006. When
the European regulation was published in 2016, the Group's Executive
Committee appointed a Group Data Protection Officer (DPO) before
it became a legal requirement. In 2017 and 2018, a network of Data
Protection Delegates was formed in the entities so as to provide
guidance on the significant changes in the new European regulation,
which affect numerous Group entities in Europe, and in certain cases
outside of the European Union.

These delegates contribute, including from the time that new offerings
are being designed, to the implementation or adaptation of the
framework for processing personal data, notably in terms of
transparency and systems for managing risk assessments, or even
impact analysis. The selected approach calls for continuous,
operational and educational improvement, in order to disseminate the
data protection culture to employees.

Like the security area, raising the awareness of all employees about
the risks and the acquisition of best practices by everyone were carried
out with support from the Security Department and by data protection
training. Throughout 2018, the Group and entities’ communication
departments also explained the data protection issue using a variety
of media. An employee data protection charter was disseminated in
the countries and remains accessible via the Company's intranet.

At the crossroads between the requirements of the Group's Security
Policy and the compliance approach, Orange has also implemented
procedures to trigger suitable measures if security violations that may
impact personal data are identified.

The implementation of regulation mechanisms by control authorities
in Europe is gradual and still on-going, which may lead to changes in
the approach.
2.2.4.1.2 Breach of ethical rules

(fraud, corruption, tax avoidance,
breaches of business ethics)

Risk of breach of ethical rules

The Group's Ethics Committee leads the ethics approach: it comprises.
six members of the Executive Committee, the Group's Inspector
General and the Chief Compliance Officer. Some subsidiaries also
have their own Ethics Committees.

The Group's ethics approach is based on the Code of Ethics, whose
principles and behaviors guide the Group's conduct and that of its
employees. This code is available to all employees on Orange's intranet
and also on orange.com: https://www.orange.com/en/Group/
Governance/ Governance-documentation.

Risk factors and activity management framework — 2

Activity’s control and Risk management framework

The Group's Anti-corruption Policy updated in 2017 and approved by
the Group's Ethics Committee is available to all employees on Orange's
intranet and on orange.com: https://www.orange.com/en/Group/
Governance/Governance-documentation.

This policy is sponsored at the highest level of the Group and, in
particular, affirms the principle of zero tolerance for corruption. This
principle is regularly renewed by the members of the Group's Executive
Committee. In October 2018, Orange’s new Executive Committee
confirmed and signed this commitment.

In October 2018, the Ethics Committee validated the improved and
updated “Guiding principles for the anti-corruption policy”. Their aim
is to complement the anti-corruption policy in order to make it applicable
to operational circumstances and situations. These principles may be
modified if necessary to meet any stricter local requirements and laws.
This update notably includes a wider variety of prohibited behaviors
in order to meet the requirements of the “Sapin II” law and the
formalization of the “procedure to identify, prevent and manage conflicts
of interest.”

The Group's whistleblowing mechanism has been broadened to cover
areas relating to the law on the Duty of vigilance. Its scope has now
been extended to cover “infractions or fraud in the areas of accounting,
internal control and audit, or in terms of corruption and influence
peddling, or conduct or situations that may lead to serious breaches
of human rights and fundamental freedoms, health and safety of
people and the environment.”

Keeping risks under control hinges on a six-stage approach:
management commitment, governance, risk analysis, policies and
procedures, awareness-raising and training, audits. The main
components of this approach, led by the Group's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and the entire Group Executive Committee, aim to
identify and analyze risks, roll out action plans to limit their impact on
operations, make available a set of relevant and effective controls, and
inform, train and share best practices.

The ethics approach is implemented by the network of Ethics Advisers
appointed by the members of the Executive Committee. Their task is
to deploy and maintain the policies and procedures in their subsidiaries
and entities, including:

= risk analysis;

= the implementation by the countries or business lines of the Group's
Code of Ethics;

= the Group's whistleblowing mechanism and local mechanisms when
they exist;

= the principles for managing conflicts of interest;
= ethics training or awareness-raising via videos or e-learning modules;

= an annual event, the Ethics & Compliance Day, in the Group and
entities.

Ananti-corruption compliance program was introduced in 2012; it has
been continually strengthened since then in order to better meet the
new challenges. Due to the international nature and diversification of
its business, the Group must incorporate a certain number of local
and international regulatory and legislative constraints, which have an
extraterritorial scope, and in particular the “Sapin II" legislation
promulgated in France in December 2016.

2 — Risk factors and activity management framework

Activity’s control and Risk management framework

The Group compliance team reports to the Group Chief Compliance
Officer, who reports in turn to the Secretary General of Orange. This
teamis in charge of designing, rolling out, coordinating and controlling
Group-wide compliance programs. The corruption prevention program
is rolled out by the network of CCOs (Chief Compliance Officers) and
COs (Compliance Officers) and covers various aspects:

= governance with the Group Ethics Committee which regularly
reviews the program's implementation and the Group Risks
Committee which holds a meeting dedicated to compliance risk at
least once a year that is attended by the Lead Director;

analysis of corruption risks, at Group, subsidiary and relevant entity
levels, to improve the targeting of the actions that need to be
implemented;

= the Group's anti-corruption policy and any local variations;

= a “fraud and compliance” due diligence methodology for customers,
partners and intermediaries, which is being progressively rolled out
across the Group;

= the “gifts and invitations” policy which manages benefits received
or offered; dedicated apps are being phased in to ensure tracing of
reports and managerial approvals of any thresholds exceeded;

= the Group's whistleblowing mechanism in place since the early
2000s; it provides protection for whistleblower employees against
any sanctions or discriminatory measures as well as the
confidentiality of the information communicated, notably the
whistleblower’s identity;

= the procedure to prevent and manage conflicts of interest;

= training and awareness-raising tools on the prevention of corruption
(e-learning and classroom) which are made available to employees;

= monitoring of the anti-corruption program with a self-assessment
questionnaire, compliance reviews, accounting controls and a
program of audits.

New tools have been designed and communicated to support the
CCO/CO in the deployment of the anti-corruption compliance program,
and help with risk identification, third party assessment and the
declaration of offered or received benefits.

New training materials have been made available to the CCO/CO: an
e-learning module adapted from a UN module and two educational
summary booklets on corruption prevention at Orange.

Adherence to economic sanction programs

Being a global group in a constantly changing environment requires
keeping up to date with economic sanction programs and numerous
and changing embargoes. Therefore, since 2013, the Group has
strengthened its knowledge and its risk management in this field and
has issued a Group policy and a legal and compliance guide on
international economic sanctions, and implemented a due diligence
procedure involving its customers, partners and intermediaries in order
to safeguard its business and international development as much as.
possible.

Tax policy

Tax evasion has not been identified as being likely to give rise to risks
to the Group's operations or reputation.

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

The Group's approach on tax is based on three fundamental principles:
= compliance with the law in each country;

= compliance with the OECD “Transfer Pricing Guidelines for
Multinational Entreprises and Tax Administrations” principles;

= regular assessment of practices and comparison with existing
solutions on the market to ensure their relevance.

Orange in no way seeks to evade paying taxes and duties, notably
through complex and opaque structures. Orange publishes the list of
countries in which the Group has interests in its Registration Document.

The Group Tax Director, directly reporting to the Delegate Chief
Executive Officer, Finance, Performance and Europe, has a specialist
team. The Group has implemented a code of ethics on tax matters,
which applies to all the Group’s tax experts and covers all tax
operations. The code of ethics on tax matters stipulates that “Orange
group's tax experts may propose the most favorable tax options to
Orange group, knowing that their proposals must be prepared on the
basis of a professional, honest, objective and law respecting analysis.”

Every year, the tax process is subject to a review under the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act (see Section 2.2.3.2 Summary of works on Internal Control
implemented under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). This
control process covers Orange SA and its main subsidiaries. Both the
work conducted by Orange and the independent assessment by the
Statutory Auditors have reached a satisfactory conclusion for the 2018
financial year.

Orange publishes information on tax paid in its consolidated statement
of cash flows (see Section 3.3.1) and communicates the detail by
country in its Annual Report on Tax Transparency, available on the site
orange.com/Group/non-financial Reporting heading.

2.2.4.1.3 Breaches of human rights
and fundamental freedoms

The potential or actual breaches of human rights and fundamental
freedoms that Orange may have caused are taken into account as
part of Orange's 2018 vigilance plan.

Orange's policy of compliance and promotion of human rights is
shown by a number of commitments:

= Orange was one of the first companies to sign up to the United
Nations Global Compact in 2000. Respecting the fundamental
principles set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
by the International Labor Organization explicitly features in the
Group's Code of Ethics. Orange thus asserts its commitment to
respecting and promoting fundamental human rights in its activities
and sphere of influence, in particular in supporting and promoting
freedom of expression and respect for privacy worldwide. The
Group also confirms its commitment to ensuring that these rights
are respected by each ofits employees and managers, both internally
(employee relations) and in its relationships with its customers,
suppliers and subcontractors;

= in 2006, Orange signed a global agreement on fundamental social
rights with the Global Union Alliance (UNI). Orange's management,
the UNI global union and its French trade union members, and
Orange's representative in the Global Union meet twice per year to
review current international operations and major development and
acquisition projects;


--- Page 64 ---

= in 2017, Orange published its first report on respect for human
rights, prepared according to a reporting framework in line with the
United Nations’ Guiding Principles on corporations and human
rights (orange.com/Group/non-financial Reporting heading), as well
as its first declaration on the non-use of modern slavery
(orange.com/Group/non-financial Reporting heading).

Since 2012, as part of its annual survey of human rights or EIDH
(measurement of the difference between the commitments made by
States (human rights in principle) and the possibility of these rights
being enjoyed in practice in the countries (human rights in practice),
Orange has asked Verisk Maplecroft, a specialist external firm using
a methodology based on the UN and OECD standards, to carry out
a customized assessment of the risks incurred in terms of compliance
with human rights in each country where Orange operates, in to
assess and target its actions. This multi-criteria analysis notably
includes the risks of corruption, breaches of democracy and freedom
of expression, the degree of digital inclusion, discrimination, etc.

Orange is strongly committed to promoting freedom of expression and
respect for privacy in the ICT sector, in particular within the Global
Network Initiative (GNI), a multistakeholder platform, including Internet
operators, NGOs, universities and socially responsible investors.
Orange and its peers meet regularly as part of this body to exchange
best practices relating to government requests in the
telecommunications sector. More specifically, they deal with potential
conflicts between the commitment and duty of sovereign governments.
and the responsibility of telecommunications companies with respect
to human rights (network interruptions, illegal Internet content, etc.).
Pooling each operators’ resources enables a complete analysis of the
legal and regulatory framework country by country. It also facilitates
dialogue with governments and international institutions (United
Nations, European Commission, Council of Europe) in order to make
recommendations on local policies and laws to ensure respect for
freedom of expression and privacy worldwide.

The GNI principles updated in 2017 provide a common framework at
Group level for the preparation of policies and procedures relating to
freedom of expression and respect of privacy in the ICT sector. Each
year, Orange report, on its web site, the ways in which the Group
applies these principles.

To deal with the proliferation of demands from governments that could
infringe freedom of expression or fundamental freedoms, Orange has
implemented a procedure, under the responsibility of the Group
Secretary General and Group Corporate Social Responsibility
Department, to ensure that each request complies with the legal or
regulatory formalities required and analyzed by the GNI. Thus, Orange
ensures that an official request in writing has been received by the
manager of the relevant entities, and that it has been subject to an
internal report to the Group.

Backed by its membership in the EDH (Entreprises pour les Droits de
I'Homme) association, an organization grouping together 16 of the
largest French companies, Orange has deployed e-learning training
which is available in 90% of the countries in which the Group operates
to disseminate its main principles among its employees.

2.2.4.2 Employment-related consequences
of our activities

The framework for controlling non-financial risks related to the
employment-related consequences of the business concerns:

Risk factors and activity management framework — 2

Activity’s control and Risk management framework

= the difficulty for Orange to obtain and retain the skills needed for its
business;

= the prevention of internal and external human risks relating to health
and safety;

= the preservation and protection of human rights and fundamental

freedoms in relation to its employees or those of its outsourcing chain.
2.2.4.2.1 Ensuring the necessary skills
for business activities

To guarantee that the Group obtains and retains the skills needed for
its business, Orange aims to be a “digital and people-oriented
employer”:

by using its innovation culture and digital expertise to serve its teams;

by rethinking working methods and by developing autonomy;

by promoting cooperation and mutual support in a quality working
environment;

by allowing each person to play a role in their own development.

Employment and key skills

To adapt to the increasingly rapid change in its business activities and
guarantee the skills required for its development, in February 2017,
Orange signed an agreement on the recognition of skills and
qualifications with the trade unions; the Group is therefore changing
its Employment and Skills policy in a profound manner by identifying
key expertise and skills and managing them in strategically.

A new “business lines and skills” framework, planned for 2020 at
Group level, has been initially deployed for the Orange SA scope. The
employee assessment interview process that ended at the start of
2019 enables every individual to be positioned in a business line within
the new framework and an initial skills mapping to be carried out. The
comparison with forecasts of business skill requirements enables
future gaps to be identified, and depending on their nature, the best
solution for overcoming them to be agreed: transformation of existing
skills via Orange Academy, external recruitment, outsourcing, etc.

Skills development

Orange offers all of its employees a tailored learning experience, that
is flexible and adapted to the person's context and needs, notably
thanks to Orange Learning. This tool currently being deployed within
the Group is a tailored learning space which enables every individual
to access their development plan easily, as well as training via a single
catalog: continuously accessible digital content, multi-modal training
combining digital and attendance-based learning, learning and sharing
communities, etc.

Compensation

Compensation policy is a fundamental component of management,
designed to meet the Orange group's strategic objectives and be
consistent with other HR policies (recruitment, career development,
training and working conditions). Its particular aim is to recognize the
individual and group contributions to customer satisfaction and to
sharing value in all of the countries. It encourages the balance between
economic performance and social quality. It aims to attract the new
skills that the Group needs.

The cost of the compensation policy must be funded by each business
unit taking into account anticipated growth in revenue, and the policy's
foreseeable consequences on reported EBITDA.

2.2.4.2.2 Employee health and safety

Group occupational health and safety policy

Orange’s commitment on occupational health and safety is led by its
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: on January 21, 2017, in a third
policy communication on health, safety and quality of life at work,
Orange reaffirmed its enduring commitment in these areas. Protecting
its employees’ occupational health and safety and improving their
quality of life at work contributes fully to Orange's aim to be a leading
employer in its sector.

This policy is based on the global health and safety agreement, signed
in November 2014, and the laws and regulations in force in each
country. This agreement commits our partners and subcontractors.
To continue with this action, the Group has created a vigilance plan
for 2018, pursuant to the Law of March 27, 2017 (see Section 4.6
Duty of vigilance).

Orange group’s global health and safety agreement (2014)

In line with the Group's health and safety agreement, and as part of
the vigilance plan, different measures have been deployed to continuously
improve the quality of life at work for the Group's employees:

= the definition of acommon Group basis for occupational health and
safety;

= theimplementation of an occupational health and safety management
system in all Group companies in a continuous improvement approach;

a participative approach for all players including social dialogue in
the area of occupational health and safety;

= non-discrimination in terms of health for employees and specific
vigilance for population groups made vulnerable for health reasons;

= the promotion of all initiatives encouraging participation in health
protection programs appropriate to the context and local practices;

= specific discussion of healthcare costs coverage in the African region;

= the need for specific vigilance to ensure that Orange’s service
providers have their own health and safety policy. Subcontractor
accident rates are closely monitored, in particular by the health and
safety officers and OH&S experts, with follow-up assessments and
the preparation of action plans.

These actions are supported and monitored by the Risk Prevention
and Occupational Quality of Life Department internationally and
presented annually to the Worldwide Works Council.

Social dialogue on occupational health and safety

Social dialogue on occupational health and safety takes place within
the legal or employee representative bodies and takes the form of
agreements signed with social partners.

In France, there are 250 Health and Safety and Working Conditions
Committees (CHSCT) that regularly hold discussions with employee
representative bodies such as the CNSHSCT (National Health and
Safety and Working Conditions Committee) and the CNPS (National
Stress Prevention Committee). Numerous agreements promote the
deployment of the Group's quality of life at work policy and the active
prevention of risks to employee health and safety:

= the teleworking agreement, amended in 2017, makes teleworking
part of an overall economic, social and environmental approach,
with expected benefits in terms of well-being at work and travel time
savings;

= the agreement on the assessment and adaptation of workloads
(2016) sets a methodological framework and common references
for specifically understanding the problems of workloads related to
changes in the workforce and skills;

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

= the digital transformation support agreement (2016) notably enables
the implementation of individual digital use reports;

= the agreement on the assessment and prevention of psychosocial
risks (2010) notably endorsed the creation of a National Stress
Prevention Committee;

= the agreement on workplace gender equality and work-life balance
(2018) offers a framework to facilitate the best balance between
professional and private life for each employee, whilst enabling them
to overcome major life events.

Internationally, each subsidiary now has a Health and Safety and
Working Conditions Committee or a Health and Safety Committee. In
the Africa and Middle East region, specific training programs for Health
and Safety Committee members have been deployed since the
signature of the global health and safety Agreement.

Orange group’s occupational health
and safety management system (OHSMS)

The OHSMS is based on either the Group's OHSMS guidelines or a
recognized national or international (OHSAS 18001) standard, to be
chosen by the entity or subsidiary. Its deployment enables a shift
towards a real culture of managing occupational health and safety
within the Group.

Training for managers and information sessions for pilot partners
(member of the Management and OH&S expert) are regularly held in
France. This same approach is currently being developed in the rest
of the Group.

Audits are periodically conducted throughout the Group, according to
a schedule that depends on the framework selected.

People involved in prevention

The OH&S experts and officers support management by providing
advice and local expertise with respect to the prevention of
occupational risks.

In France, the network of over 200 experts, whose approach is based
on methodological support and skills development, continues to put
their activities on a more professional footing.

Internationally, the OH&S officers receive support from the Risk
Prevention and Occupational Quality of Life Department via regular
contacts and an annual seminar.

This international network is also supported on a monthly basis by a
telephone conference focusing on one of the five main topics of
“Quality of Life at Work by Orange”:

= occupational health and risk prevention;
= the workplace environment;

= work;

= management;

= improving individual well-being.

The organization of occupational health services depends on the
legislation in each country.

2.2.4.2.3 Social dialogue

Orange group promotes a structured, nourished and meaningful social
dialogue. It has discussions with its employees, the trade union
organizations and associations of elected employees. With a focus on
increased transparency and collaboration, Orange has set up employee
representative institutions for all scopes. Each of these institutions has
its own powers which improve the social dialogue.

Orange recognizes the right for its employees to have freedom of
association, representation and membership of a trade union in
accordance with the principles set by the ILO convention no. 87 of 1948
on freedom of association and the right to organize. Employees are
free to become members of their choice of trade union or not to do so.


--- Page 66 ---

Worldwide Works Council

The Worldwide Works Council is a social dialogue body created by an
agreement signed in June 2010. It enables all the Group’s employees
worldwide to be represented, and to exchange information with
employee representatives on transnational economic, financial and
social issues.

Its tasks are as follows:

= promote the communication of Group issues to employee
representatives;

= improve the Group's social dialogue on a world level;

= be part of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) development
strategy.

This Council does not replace existing national representation bodies
nor the European Works Council. It complements the agreement
signed in 2006 with the Global Union Alliance (UNI) on respect for
fundamental rights. It meets at least once a year on the initiative of its
Chairperson who is the Group's Chairman and CEO or his
representative and each time that exceptional circumstances require
it, with management agreement.

European Works Council

The European Works Council is a social dialogue body at the European
level for economic, financial and social issues. It was created by an
agreement signed on April 14, 2004.

Its tasks are as follows:
= develop social dialogue at a European level;

= create a forum for discussion and dialogue on broad economic,
financial and social issues at an overall European level that go
beyond the borders of any single country (industrial and innovation
strategy, major investment policies, employment, etc.);

= complement the national social dialogue bodies, without aiming to
replace or supervise them.

The European Works Council meets at least three times per year, and
each time that exceptional circumstances require it. Its members
regularly receive information on life in the Group and telephone
conferences are organized when warranted by events.

Other national social dialogue bodies

The France Works Council is responsible for ensuring communication
and dialogue with the employee representatives from the Group's
different entities in France. This Council meets at least four times a
year. It receives information on the Group's business, financial position,
change in employment and structure.

There are also different national social dialogue bodies that enable
employee representatives to be heard. In regions where representative
bodies are not legally required, the Group promotes the creation of
employee forums in order to establish formalized dialogue.

2.2.4.2.4 Promoting diversity and equal

opportunities

Within the Group Human Resources Department, the diversity policy
has resulted in the Group's “Diversity Note” published in December 2012
in which Orange commits to promoting diversity, gender equality,
equal opportunities and the combating all types of discrimination.

Gender equality in the workplace

Orange's policy in the area of gender equality in the workplace is led
by the Professional Equality Strategy Committee, created in 2011. It
notably comprises members of the Executive Committee and is active
across Group with four areas of focus:

= equal pay: a pay gap assessment methodology for all countries was
deployed by the Group in 2018;

= access for women to positions of responsibility: the Group has set
itself the target of 35% of women on executive management bodies;
this target is made tangible through the talent management policy,
and also mentoring and development programs. It is driven internally
and externally by identified employee networks, which contribute
on an operational basis to the Group's diversity policy (diversity
networks);

diversity in all Group business lines, particularly technical business
lines: this is achieved by several upstream actions to attract girls
into the technical occupations (shadowing program), by the
recruitment and vocational retraining of women as part of specific
mechanisms (technician training for women, engineer training for
women), and by increasing recruiter awareness of gender equality
in the workplace;

= work-life balance: this balance is driven by HR policies with numerous
measures and agreements on teleworking, flextime, parenthood
measures and support for employees who are carers.

In 2015, on behalf of the Group, the Chairman and CEO signed the
United Nations’ Women Empowerment Principles, confirming Orange
commitment on a global level.

The Group has also committed to the effective assessment of its
diversity and gender equality policy through GEEIS (Gender Equality
European and International Standard) certification and by listening to
its stakeholders on diversity by means of a global system.

For the French scope, this is also reflected in:

= the signature of the Charter of 15 commitments for work-life balance
by the Chairman and CEO and the members of the Group’s
Executive Committee in 2013, and the signature in 2008 of the
Parenthood Charter;

= the fifth agreement on workplace gender equality and work-life
balance 2018-2020 which was signed in January 2018 by all the
trade unions. It includes new measures such as the broadening of
the vacation day donation scheme and the setting up of a support
platform to help with the administrative procedures for arranging
care for employee family members;

= awareness-raising in workplace equality via an online training
program leading to a “workplace equality visa”.

Activity’s control and Risk management framework

2.2.4.3 Social consequences of our activities

The framework for controlling non-financial risks related to the social
responsibility consequences of the business covers:

= protection against the potentially harmful effect on people's health
of exposure to electromagnetic fields from telecommunications
equipment;

= the excessive or inappropriate use of telecommunication services
and equipment.

2.2.4.3.1 Protecting customers’ health and safety

One of Orange's priorities is to develop safe, responsible, and creative
digital practices. For this reason, Orange carefully monitors expert
opinions on the issue of digital uses and health, and aims to relay their
opinions and advice to parents, young people and families in general.

With regard to children, Orange’s commitment is supported by the
“Better Internet for Kids” (BIK) program which aims to give parents
and educators the power to act and offer their children the best of
digital. More generally, this commitment is supported by the “Marketing
ofMeaning” program which aims to incorporate responsibility principles
in products and services from the design phase.

Orange's policy is therefore to:

raise employee awareness of the issues of responsible marketing,
define “guidelines” for product managers, and support them in their
projects (for example, no marketing offers for the under-nines age
group, no young children in Orange's advertising);

develop marketing offers in response to family concerns;

implement awareness-raising initiatives that guide parents, educators
and children in the safe use of digital technology, in cooperation with
childhood and parenthood experts and associations;

support the development of digital practices that promote creativity,
entrepreneurial spirit and education.

This policy and its monitoring are carried out by the countries’ CSR
and Marketing teams, in coordination with the Group's CSR Radio
waves and Health Committee.

2.2.4.3.2 Concerns about radio waves

Mobile telephony technologies may increase exposure to
electromagnetic waves of the general population (via new fixed emitters)
and users (via new mobile equipment or by creating new behaviors).
Emissions of electromagnetic waves are controlled by the limits
recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of now,
there is no proven effect on health below these recommended limits.
However, until we have the confirmation of additional studies under
way, specifically on children and long-term use, certain health
authorities, as a precaution, are drafting recommendations to limit
exposure to radio waves from mobile phones.

Orange implemented a Group policy on radio waves and health in
2007, in which it commits to:

= provide transparent and identical information to all of its stakeholders;

ensure that the international recommendations of the ICNIRP
(International Commission on Non-lonising Radiation Protection)
and WHO for mobiles and antennas are applied, including in the
countries of Orange's scope which do not have national regulations;

provide health authorities’ recommendations on the use of mobile
phones to limit exposure to radio waves;

contribute to scientific research and standardization efforts;

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

= raise awareness of employees working near or on antennas to the
safety regulations issued by the European Directive 2013/35/UE of
June 26, 2013 and its 2016-1074 Decree of August 3, 2016, even
in countries not subject to the Directive.

Compliance with this policy and these commitments is ensured at
Group level by the Radio Waves and Health Committee, comprising
a legal expert, a public affairs expert, a doctor, a technical expert and
two CSR experts, who meet each week to analyze health and regulatory
monitoring, coordinate actions at the Group's operational level and
draft “Group positions”. These positions are communicated to the
Group's Executive Committee as required.

2.2.4.4 Environmental impacts
of our activities

Orange adopts a proactive approach to managing risks and impact
to help protect the environment against an explosion of digital usage.

2.2.4.4.1 Orange’s environmental commitment

Orange renewed its commitment to the climate in December 2017 by
confirming that it had signed the French Business Climate Pledge
during the One Planet Summit, which was launched to implement
solutions and innovations aimed at developing a low-carbon society
by 2050.

As a member of the ITU and in line with the Science Based Targets
Initiative (SBTi), Orange helped prepare a sectoral methodology to
measure the contribution of ICTs with respect to the objective of
maintaining the rise in temperatures below 2 degrees compared with
the pre-industrial era, which was set during the COP21 (L. 1450 and
Related Supplement). A sectoral guide for applying this methodology
should be completed in 2019. In this context, Orange committed in
June 2018 to formally setting its Science Based Targets before
June 2020.

Orange has set itself the target of reducing its CO, emissions per
customer use by 50% (compared to 2006) by 2020. An annually
updated environmental roadmap sets out formal action plans in order
to meet the objective of significant savings, while responding to the
explosion in traffic and uses.

Orange has also committed to promoting the integration of circular
economy principles within its organization and processes: Orange's
aim is to limit the impact of its business and its customers’ activities
on resources and raw materials by optimizing its processes.

Orange is a member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s CE
100 program. This program brings together 100 pioneering companies
in the circular economy worldwide, and aims to share best practice
and develop innovative collaborative projects.

2.2.4.4.2 Environmental monitoring framework

The Board of Directors monitors the risks and opportunities related to
the environment, and notably climate change, via the work by the
Governance and Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee
(GCSER) and the Group Circular Economy Steering Committee.

Monitoring of Orange's environmental commitments takes place at the
Group Executive Committee level based on quarterly reporting, by the
Executive Vice-President CSR, Diversity, Partnerships and Solidarity,
for environmental policy, and by the Deputy Chief Executive
Officer - Chief Technology and Global Innovation Officer — for the part
of the GREEN ITN2020 energy consumption saving program related
to IT & networks.

Group circular economy steering committee

The Group has set up this internal steering committee for the Circular
Economy to define and monitor the actions to be deployed within its
businesses, with the appointment of project leaders and a deployment
plan for 2017-2020. Under the responsibility of the Group CSR
Department, it comprises decision-makers in the Group's main
business lines: Purchasing, Supply Chain, Marketing, Networks,
Technocenter etc.

The plan covers several areas:
= eco-design;
= limiting the Group's consumption of critical, non-renewable resources;

= optimizing waste management;

the possibility of giving network equipment and consumer handsets
a second life.

Monitoring committee for alignment with the TCFD’s
recommendations

To respond to the recommendations of the TCFD (Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures) published on June 29, 2017,
Orange initially carried out an analysis of the existing reporting
arrangements in order to identify its strengths and areas for
improvement. Since this work was completed during the first half of
2018, Orange decided to set up a specific monitoring committee,
steered by the Group CSR Department with support from the
consulting firm, Carbone 4. This committee aims to improve the
collection and reporting of information on climate change and identify
the projects that need to be implemented to best meet the TCFD's
recommendations.

A cross-reference table describing Orange's responses to the TCFD.
recommendations is available in Section 4.4.2.3 Alignment with the
TCFD’s recommendations.

Players involved in environmental awareness-raising and
training

The Group Environment Department regularly holds discussions with
a network of national and business area contacts comprising around
90 people; each year, it organizes a seminar to discuss best practice
and launch new projects.

Internal communications conducts regular awareness-raising initiatives
with all the Group's employees when key events such as the United
Nations Climate Change Conference and environment days are taking
place.

Initiatives for awareness raising and discussion thus encourage each
employee to include the objectives of responsible growth in their daily
activities. Dedicated training courses are delivered regularly.

Since 2018, in France, an electrical energy consumption management
indicator has been included in the calculation of the incentive element
of Orange SA's employee compensation, thus giving more visibility to
this subject.

Environmental Management System

In order to achieve its targets for reducing environmental impacts and
risks the Group has been progressively rolling out ISO 14001 compliant
Environmental Management Systems (EMS) in its main countries of
operation. The ISO 14001 standard describes how companies should
organize themselves to manage the environmental impact of their
activities. The 2015 version of this standard includes new requirements,
which the Group is gradually incorporating, particularly through
stakeholder dialogue and by taking into account complete life cycle
impacts.

Risk factors and activity management framework — 2

Activity’s control and Risk management framework

2.2.4.4.3 Management of environmental

compliance risks

Facilities classified for the protection of the environment

The Orange group uses certain facilities, products and substances
that may present environmental risks (even minor), some of which are
subject to specific regulations. This is the case for facilities classified
for the protection of the environment (ICPE) in France.

These facilities are the subject of ongoing in-depth analyses by the
Orange group and have led to the adoption of action plans and
preventive maintenance programs, in addition to periodic inspections
as required under French regulations. The rollout of the Environmental
Management System and ISO 14001 certification audits also ensures
compliance with related regulations and audits.

In order to prevent health-related risks (legionellosis) and reduce water
consumption, a program to replace cooling towers with dry cooler
systems has been ongoing in France since 2006. The increase in the
number of water cooling towers in France is due to the restructuration
of technical sites.

Indicators 2018 2017 2016
Number of sites including

Classified Facilities

(ICPE A, D, DC and E) in France 249 262 269
Number of water cooling

towers in France 31 29 27

Hazardous substances

Some facilities use regulated products or substances. These are
chlorofluorocarbon (also named CFC gases) or other refrigerants (more
specifically HCFCs or HFCs) contained in air-conditioning installations —
see above.

Orange complies with the European REACH Regulation (Registration —
Evaluation — Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) and has
undertaken to inform its customers of the presence of hazardous
substances as defined by regulations.

Orange also respects the European Directive RoHS II, by which the
Group must comply with the obligations of the producer or those of
the distributor to limit the use of certain hazardous substances in
electric and electronic equipment. As a contract provision, the Group
requests that suppliers apply the European RoHS |! directive to all
products that are subject to it, including outside of Europe.

Provisions for environmental risk

The Orange group believes that its activities as a telecommunications
operator do not pose a serious direct threat to the environment. The
Group's activities do not entail production processes with a severe
impact on scarce or non-renewable resources, natural resources
(water, air) or to biodiversity and, generally, do not pose lethal risks.
This is why no provision for environmental risk has been made in the
Group's accounts.

However, a provision is recognized to cover the Group's obligation to
dismantle technical equipment and restore technical sites.

The provision is set on the basis of:

= dismantling costs (on a per-unit basis for telephone poles, terminals
and public phones, and per site for cell phone antennae) borne by
the Group to meet its environmental obligations;

= annual scheduled asset returns and departures from sites.

Activity’s control and Risk management framework

In the Group's financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2018, the provision totaled 776 million euros, of which 430 million
euros for Orange SA. It consists predominantly of the cost of restoring
sites of mobile telephony antennae to their former state, reprocessing
of telephone poles, managing electrical and electronic waste, and
dismantling public phones.

2.2.4.5 Management framework

for suppliers and subcontractors

Orange’s responsible purchasing principles

Orange has for several years implemented a responsible purchasing
policy which embeds CSR in its supplier relationships and improves
control of social, societal and environmental risks. Its Group-wide CSR
action plan aims to promote the adoption of CSR commitments by
purchasing stakeholders and their application in the related business
processes, and to guarantee the Group's compliance with the law on
the duty of vigilance. All of these principles have also been adopted
by Buyin, the joint venture between Orange and Deutsche Telekom,
which covers the Group's main purchasing domains.

This policy was updated in 2018 (available on the site
orange.com/Group/non-financial Reporting) and is based on the
following priorities:

developing balanced relationships with suppliers based on trust,
respect and sustainable commercial relationships;

contributing to economic performance by creating value and by
ensuring products and services are available at the lowest possible
cost;

managing CSR risks and opportunities related to purchasing and
the supply chain;

providing the Group and its customers with the benefit of the know-
how of innovative and high-performance suppliers.

It is based on the systematic incorporation of a CSR clause in the
Group's framework agreements as well as into exclusively local
contracts, reinforced by the integration of the Code of Conduct into

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

the appendices to these contracts. The Code of Conduct describes
in particular the ethical, social and environmental commitments
expected by the Group. Orange thus requires that its partners, suppliers
and their sub-contractors i) respect all national, European and
international rules with respect to ethical and responsible behavior.
This includes, without limitation, standards relating to human rights,
respect for the environment, sustainable development, occupational
health and safety conditions for the employees, corruption and child
protection; ii) adopt and apply ethical standards and the Group’s
commitments and to continue to grow in these domains. Orange
supports its suppliers throughout the pre-contractual and contractual
relationship to ensure the effective implementation of the Code of
Conduct.

Supplier assessment

The Group evaluates its suppliers on a documentary basis, either by
means of a questionnaire developed by Orange or via a company
specialized in sustainable sourcing (EcoVadis, which offers a self-
evaluation form according to ISO 26000 on supplier CSR
commitments). Orange has besides been evaluated as a supplier by
this body. This year it achieved gold member status yet again.

The Group has set up a monitoring and alert system for purchasing
and procurement risks related to suppliers deemed strategic to the
organization and whose default could have major consequences on
the Group's operations.

Orange also contributes to the development of its standards through
the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC), which is an association of
telecommunications operators (16 to date), grouped together to audit,
evaluate and develop the implementation of CSR principles by the
global suppliers of the ICT segment.

It deploys a coordinated program of on-site CSR audits founded on
verification, evaluation, and development of a common methodology:
audits to assess suppliers’ compliance with social and environmental
accountability standards (SA 8000, ISO 14001, etc.) and, if necessary,
to implement corrective action plans.

This section contains forward-looking statements about Orange. These
forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements. The most
significant risks are detailed in Section 2.1 Risk factors.

The following comments are based on the consolidated annual financial
statements prepared in accordance with IFRS (International Financial
Reporting Standards, see Note 2 to the consolidated annual financial
statements). The Group has decided to apply IFRS 15 “Revenue from
Contracts with Customers” retroactively as from January 1, 2018,
restating the published comparative periods of 2016 and 2017. In
addition, the Group has applied IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” since
January 1, 2018, without restating the 2016 and 2017 comparative
periods, as permitted by the standard (see Note 2.3 to the consolidated
annual financial statements).

Adjusted EBITDA, reported EBITDA, CAPEX, the “Adjusted
EBITDA - CAPEX’ indicator, net financial debt, the ratio of net financial
debt to adjusted EBITDA of telecoms activities, and data on a
comparable basis are financial indicators not defined by IFRS. For
further information on the calculation of these indicators and the
reasons why the Orange group uses them and considers them useful
for readers, see Section 3.1.5 Financial indicators not defined by IFRS
and Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary.

3.1.1 Overview

Financial Report — 3

Analysis of the Group’s financial position and earnings

Data on a historical basis corresponds to data for past periods as
published in the consolidated annual financial statements for the
current period. The transition from data on a historical basis to data
on a comparable basis for the 2017 and 2016 fiscal years is set out
in Section 3.1.5.1 Data on a comparable basis.

The new organization of Orange Group's Executive Committee
implemented with effect from May 2, 2018 (see Section 1.3 Significant
events) has led the Group to review how its segment information is
presented, without changing the definition of its operating segments.
The segment information now makes a distinction between Spain and
the other European countries (see the beginning of Section 1.3 Analysis
by operating segment and Note 1.7 to the consolidated annual financial
statements). Historical data, comparable basis data and customer
bases for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 have been restated to reflect this
change. Unless otherwise specified, segment information presented
in the following sections is understood to be prior to elimination of
inter-segment transactions.

The changes presented in the following sections are calculated based
on data in thousands of euros, although displayed in millions of euros.

3.1.1.2 Summary of 2018 results

The annual results confirm that all the targets announced for fiscal year
2018 were achieved. Despite strong competition, Group revenue,
adjusted EBITDA and the “Adjusted EBITDA - CAPEX" indicator all
increased.

Revenue totaled 41,381 million euros in 2018, up 1.3% on both a
historical basis and a comparable basis compared with 2017. Higher
revenue in Africa & Middle East (up 5.1% on a comparable basis),
driven by the increase in data services and mobile financial services,
contributed almost half of the Group's growth in 2018. On acomparable
basis, revenue growth in Spain (up 2.2%), Europe (up 1.7%) and
France (up 0.9%) is due to convergence.

Sales activity is still dynamic due to the strategy focused on
convergence and very high-speed fixed and mobile broadband, which
allowed the Group to continue to grow its customer base in an
environment that remains highly competitive. Year-on-year convergent
offers (10.9 million customers at December 31, 2018) increased by
5.5% and SIM cards associated with convergent offers grew by 8.0%,
enabling Orange to confirm its position as the leading convergent
operator in Europe. At December 31, 2018, very high-speed fixed
broadband, with 6.3 million customers, grew by 33.2% and 4G mobile
had 56 million customers, up 21.7% year-on-year. The total mobile
customer base grew by 0.6% year-on-year. Finally, 248,000 customers,
had subscribed to the Orange Bank offer at December 31, 2018.

Adjusted EBITDA totaled 13,005 million euros in 2018, up 2.6% on
a historical basis and 2.7% on a comparable basis compared with
2017. Adjusted EBITDA of telecoms activities (13,151 million euros)
grew by 3.4% year-on-year on a comparable basis, driven by solid
business performance and the continuation of the Explore2020
operational efficiency program, which exceeded its target to deliver
3.5 billion in gross savings over the period 2015-2018. The ratio of
adjusted EBITDA to revenue of telecoms activities was 31.8% in 2018,
up 0.6 points on both a historical and comparable basis relative to
2017.

Reported EBITDA amounted to 11,977 million euros in 2018, up
1.0%, or 114 million euros, compared with 2017 on a historical basis.
This was mainly due to the increase in adjusted EBITDA and the lower
net expense on significant litigation. However, this increase is partially
dampened by the charge recognized for the French “Part-Time for
Seniors” plans (TPS, relating to agreements on the employment of
older workers in France), which was extended in December 2018 for
three years (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).

Operating income amounted to 4,829 million euros in 2018, an
increase of 51 million euros (1.1%) compared with 2017 on a historical
basis. The increase is largely explained by the growth in reported
EBITDA and the reduction in impairment losses on goodwill and fixed
assets, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization, mainly
due to the additional investments made in recent years.

Consolidated net income totaled 2,158 million euros in 2018,
compared with 2,040 million euros in 2017, an increase of 118 million
euros. This mainly stems from the improvement in net finance costs
(essentially due to changes in the effects of the investment in BT
Group) and the increase in operating income, partially offset by higher
income tax expense.

CAPEX stood at 7,442 million euros in 2018, up 3.2% on a historical
basis and 3.5% on a comparable basis, compared with 2017. The
ratio of CAPEX to revenue of telecoms activities was 17.9% in 2018,
up 0.4 points on both a historical and a comparable basis compared
with 2017. This level of capital expenditure is in line with the annual
target of 7.4 billion euros in 2018 and reflects the Group's continuing
efforts to roll out very high-speed fixed and mobile broadband networks.
At December 31, 2018, the Group thus had 32.5 million households
worldwide with very high-speed broadband connectivity, up 22.4%
year-on-year.

Net financial debt amounted to 25,441 million euros at December 31,
2018, arise of 1,598 million euros from December 31, 2017. The ratio
of net financial debt to adjusted EBITDA of telecoms activities stood
at 1.93 at December 31, 2018, in line with the Group's medium-term
target of around 2.

Analysis of the Group’s financial position and earnings

> 2018 vs 2017

In 2018, the revenue of the Orange group totaled 41,381 million euros,
an increase of 1.3% on ahistorical basis and of 1.3% on a comparable
basis compared with 2017.

On a historical basis, the 1.3% increase in Group revenue between
2017 and 2018, an increase of 522 million euros, includes:

= the negative impact of foreign exchange fluctuations totaling
189 million euros, chiefly attributable to changes in the value of the
US dollar (for 84 million euros), the Egyptian pound (for 27 million
euros), the Jordanian dinar (for 18 million euros) and the Argentine
peso (for 10 million euros) against the euro;

= which is more than offset:

- by the positive impact of changes in the scope of consolidation
and other changes, which amounted to 167 million euros and
mainly include the effects of the takeover of Business & Decision
on 5 June 2018, and the acquisitions of Basefarm Holding on
14 August 2018 and Enovacom on 21 February 2018,

- and by the organic change on a comparable basis, representing
a 544 million euro increase in revenue.

On a comparable basis, the 1.3% or 544 million euro increase in
Group revenue between 2017 and 2018 was attributable primarily to:

= the 250 million euro increase in revenue in Africa & Middle East
countries (a 5.1% increase), due to the growth recorded in 13 of
the 17 countries consolidated, driven by strong performances from
the Sonate! subgroup (mainly in Guinea, Senegal and Mali), Egypt
and the Ivory Coast subgroup (mainly Burkina Faso), Morocco and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The increase in
mobile only services reflects the momentum in data services and
Orange Money (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events), partially
offset by the decline in carrier services — particularly international
carrier services — and incoming mobile traffic;

= the 163 million euro increase in revenue in France (an increase of
0.9%). This change was mainly due to (i) the favorable effect of
including digital reading offers (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant
events), (ii) the growth of convergent services, driven by both the
increase in customer base and the rise in 12-month convergent
ARPO (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary), and (ili) to a lesser
extent, the increase in mobile equipment sales, (iv) partially offset
by the downward trend in fixed only narrowband services (traditional
telephony), the contraction in mobile only services (mainly linked to
the migration of contract offers to convergent offers and the structural
decline in prepaid offers), and the decrease in carrier services (the
growth in FTTH only partially offsetting the anticipated fall in revenue
from national roaming and unbundling);

= the 117 million euro increase in revenue in Spain (a 2.2% increase),
against a background of strong competition for entry into the mobile
and fixed broadband markets. This change was mainly due to (i)
the development of convergent services, which benefited from the
increase in 12-month convergent ARPO (driven by the increase in
access to very high-speed broadband and content offers) and
growth in the customer base, and (ii) the increase in carrier services
(the decline in incoming mobile traffic being more than offset by the
growth in very high-speed broadband, other fixed revenues and the
increase in national roaming);

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

= andthe 94 million euro increase in revenue in Europe (arise of 1.7%),
mainly due to:

— (i) strong growth in convergent services in Poland, Belgium and
Romania, and to a lesser extent, (ii) the increase in sales of mobile
equipment in Romania, and (iii) the growth of mobile carrier
services (national roaming, incoming mobile traffic) and IT &
integration services in Poland,

— partially offset by (i) the contraction in fixed only services (structural
decline in traditional telephony) and equipment sales in Poland,
(ii) the downturn in mobile only services in Poland and Romania,
linked to the migration to convergent offers, and (iii) the decrease
in services to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) in
Belgium.

These positive items were partially offset by:

= the 99 million euro fall in revenue from services to International
carriers & Shared services (a 6.1% reduction), primarily due to more
muted international carrier business (decline in the voice market for
Africa and the Maghreb);

= and, to a lesser extent, the 16 million euro fall in revenue from
services to Enterprises. Between the two periods, the contraction
in fixed only services (voice and data services) and in mobile
equipment sales are almost entirely offset by growth in IT & integration
services.

> 2017 vs 2016

In 2017, the revenue of the Orange group totaled 40,859 million euros,
an increase of 0.4% on a historical basis and of 1.2% on a comparable
basis compared with 2016.

On a historical basis, the 0.4% increase in Group revenue between
2016 and 2017, an increase of 151 million euros, includes:

= the negative impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, in the amount
of 485 million euros, chiefly attributable to the change in the value
of the Egyptian pound against the euro, resulting in an adverse
impact of 517 million euros;

= which is more than offset:

— by the favorable impact of changes in the scope of consolidation
and other changes, which stood at 160 million euros and
essentially included the effects of the acquisition of entities in
Africa in 2016 (Airtel in Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone, Oasis
(Tigo) in the Congo (DRC), and Cellcom Telecommunications in
Liberia), for 186 million euros,

— and by the organic change on a comparable basis, representing
a 476 million euro increase in revenue.

On a comparable basis, the 1.2% or 476 million euro increase in
Group revenue between 2016 and 2017 was attributable primarily to:

= the 322 million euro increase in revenue in Spain (up 6.6%). This
change is mainly due to (i) strong growth in revenue from convergent
services, driven by content offers and the development of very
high-speed broadband access, (ii) growth in revenue from carrier
services (national and visitor roaming), and (iii) to a lesser extent, the
increase in revenue from fixed only services and equipment sales;

= the 150 million euro increase in revenue in France (an increase of
0.8%). This performance is largely due to () growth in revenue from
convergent services and fixed carrier services, the positive effect of


--- Page 76 ---

including digital reading offers since early October 2017, and higher
mobile equipment sales, (ii) partially offset by the downward trend
in revenue from fixed narrowband services (traditional telephony)
only, and the contraction in revenue from mobile only services.
Between the two periods, the effect of the end of additional roaming
charges in EU countries on June 15, 2017 is almost neutral on
France's revenue, since the increase in visitor roaming makes up
for the fall in customer roaming;

= the 149 million euro increase in revenue in Africa & Middle East
countries (a 3.0% increase), driven by strong performances by the
Sonatel subgroup (mainly in Mali and Guinea) and the Ivory Coast
subgroup (mainly in Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast), as well as in
Morocco;

= the 24 million euro increase in revenue in Europe (an increase of
0.4%). This performance is mainly due to (i) the increase in revenue

Financial Report — 3

Analysis of the Group’s financial position and earnings

from convergent services, mainly in Poland and Belgium, and to a
lesser extent, the rise in equipment sales in Romania and higher
revenue from mobile carrier services in Poland and Romania, (ii)
partially offset by the fall in revenue from mobile only services in
almost all European countries, and the decline in revenue from fixed
only services in Poland (traditional telephony).

These positive items were partially offset by:

= the 155 million euro or 8.6% decline in revenue from services to
International Carriers & Shared Services, primarily due to the
downturn in fixed services to international carriers;

= the 65 million euro or 0.9% decline in Enterprise service revenue,
due essentially to (i) the contraction in revenue from fixed only
services (data and voice services), (ii) which was only partially offset
by improved revenue from IT & integration services and from mobile
equipment and services.

> 2018 vs 2017

In 2018, Orange group adjusted EBITDA amounted to 13,005 million
euros (breaking down into 13,151 million euros for the telecoms
activities and a loss of 147 million euros for the Orange Bank activities),
up 2.6% on a historical basis and 2.7% on a comparable basis
compared with 2017. The ratio of adjusted EBITDA of telecoms
activities to revenue was 31.8% in 2018, up 0,6 percentage points on
a historical basis and 0,6 percentage points on a comparable basis
compared with 2017.

Between 2017 and 2018, adjusted EBITDA received a 111 million euro
boost from the inclusion of digital reading offers (see Section 3.1.1.3
Significant events), with a positive impact of 158 million euros in 2018
compared with 47 million euros in 2017.

On a historical basis, the 2.6% or 325 million euro rise in Group
adjusted EBITDA between 2017 and 2018 reflected:

= the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations, which amounted
to 28 million euros, mainly due to the performance of the U.S. dollar
against the euro;

= which was more than offset by (i) the favorable impact of changes.
in the scope of consolidation and other changes, for 8 million euros,
and (ii) organic growth on a comparable basis, for an increase of
345 million euros in adjusted EBITDA.

On a comparable basis, the 2.7% increase in the Group’s adjusted
EBITDA between 2017 and 2018 resulted mainly from:

= the growth in revenue of 1.3%, or 544 million euros, boosted by the
inclusion of digital reading offers (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant
events);

= the 3.2% or 162 million euro reduction in service fees and
inter-operator costs (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary), resulting
(i) mainly from the reduction in interconnection fees for services to
international carriers (linked to the downturn in traffic), and also from
the fall in interconnection fees in Spain (especially with the reduction
in national mobile termination rates in February 2018) and (ii) toa
lesser extent, the reduction in enterprise service network fees,
partially offset by growth linked to the development of cable offers
in Belgium; and

= the fall of 2.0%, or 35 million euros in adjusted operating taxes and
levies (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary), mainly in Africa &
Middle East countries due to reversals of provisions following the
expiration of tax risks in 2018;

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

= and the increase of 4.8%, or 14 million euros, in adjusted other
operating income and expenses (see Section 7.2.1 Financial
glossary), mainly due to (i) higher gains on disposal of fixed assets,
largely for shared services, in Spain and Poland (taking into account
the disposals made in 2018 as part of the streamlining of the real
estate portfolio), and to a lesser extent, (ii) the improvement in the
operational exchange rate, (iii) partially offset by the decrease in net
banking income (due to the costs of acquiring new Orange Bank
customers), and the increase in impairment losses and losses on
trade receivables.

These positive items were partially offset by:

= the growth of 5.4%, or 163 million euros, in other external purchases
(see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary), particularly in France
(purchases for resale related to the operation of networks managed
by local authorities), in Africa & Middle East countries (real estate
fees linked to network development and overheads), in Poland
(reflecting trends in energy sales) and for enterprise services;

= the 1.8% or 127 million euro increase in commercial expenses and
content costs (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary), primarily due
to (i) the increase in soccer rights in Spain in line with the commercial
momentum, (ii) agreements, extensions and renewals of partnerships
in the area of content in 2017 and 2018 (see Section 3.1.1.3
Significant events), allowing offer enhancement, essentially in Europe
and France, and (iii) the rise in commercial expenses, chiefly in the
Africa & Middle East countries (linked for the most part to the
business growth of Orange Money) and in Romania (in line with the
increase in mobile equipment sales);

= the 3.8% or 116 million euro increase in other network expenses
and IT expenses (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary), mainly in
Africa & Middle East countries (primarily due to network
development, particularly the development of 4G sites).

With an increase of 0.1%, or 4 million euros, adjusted labor expenses
(see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary) are broadly stable. Between the
two periods, the effect of the 2.5% fall in the average number of
full-time equivalent employees (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary),
representing a decrease of 3,533 full-time equivalent employees (mainly
in France and Poland), offsets in particular (') the effect of wage policies
in France and elsewhere, and (ii) the increase in share-based
compensation (mainly due to the recognition in 2018 of expenses
relating to the “Orange Vision 2020" free share award plans and “Long
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 2018-2020") (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant
events).

> 2017 vs 2016

In 2017, Orange group adjusted EBITDA amounted to 12,680 million
euros (breaking down into 12,741 million euros for the telecoms
activities and a loss of 62 million euros for the Orange Bank activities),
up 0.9% on a historical basis and 2.1% on a comparable basis
compared with 2016. The ratio of adjusted EBITDA to revenue of
telecoms activities was 31.2% in 2017, up 0.3 points on both a
historical and comparable basis compared with 2016.

On a historical basis, the 0.9% or 116 million euro rise in Group
adjusted EBITDA between 2016 and 2017 reflected:

= the negative impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, which stood
at 156 million euros, chiefly attributable to the change in the value
of the Egyptian pound against the euro, resulting in an adverse
impact of 165 million euros;

which was more than offset by (i) the favorable impact of changes
in the scope of consolidation and other changes, for 11 million
euros, and (ii) organic growth on a comparable basis, for an increase
of 261 million euros in adjusted EBITDA.

On a comparable basis, the 2.1% or 261 million euro rise in Group
adjusted EBITDA between 2016 and 2017 reflected:

= the 1.2% or 476 million euro increase in revenue;

= the 1.7% or 140 million euro decline in adjusted labor expenses,
resulting primarily from (i) the 2.7% reduction in the average number
of employees (full-time equivalents), representing a reduction of
3,794 full-time equivalent employees, mainly in France and Poland,
and (ii) the counter-effect of the recognition in 2016 of the Orange
Ambition 2016 employee shareholding plans;

Analysis of the Group’s financial position and earnings

= and the 2.8% or 147 million euro reduction in service fees and
inter-operator costs, with the negative effect of the end of additional
roaming charges in EU countries on June 15, 2017 more than offset
by (i) the deciine in traffic on international carrier services (related to
the downturn in activity) and enterprise services (essentially due to
the slowdown in satellite broadcasting services), and (ii) the drop in
interconnection fees in Africa & Middle East countries (linked to the
change in call termination rates and voice usage).

These positive items were partially offset by:

= the 5.2% or 349 million euro increase in commercial expenses and
content costs, primarily due to (i) new agreements, extensions and
renewals of partnerships in the area of content, allowing offer
enhancement, particularly in France, (ii) the increase in soccer rights
in Spain, in line with the commercial momentum, and (iii) the increase
in commercial expenses, chiefly in Africa & Middle East countries
(linked to business growth for Orange Money and data services),
and for enterprise services (due to a major mobile equipment sales
contract in the second half of 2017);

= the 24.1% or 79 million euro reduction in adjusted other operating
income and expenses, due to the decline in adjusted other operating
income, mainly caused by the fall in proceeds from the disposal of
fixed assets, tax credits and subsidies, and late-payment interest
on trade receivables;

= andthe growth of 1.7% or 51 million euros in other network expenses
and IT expenses, mainly in Africa & Middle East countries (notably
due to the extension of the mobile network, particularly the
deployment of 4G sites) and for enterprise services (in line with
growth in integration and information technology services).

capital expenditure in recent years, particularly in relation to the very
high-speed broadband network rollout (fiber and 4G), (ii) accelerated
depreciation resulting from the scheduled shutdown of a platform
in France, and (iii) the increase in depreciation relating to leased
handsets, Livebox, and equipment installed on customer premises.

In 2017, Orange group operating income amounted to 4,778 million
euros (breaking down into 4,870 million euros for the telecoms activities
and a loss of 93 million euros for the Orange Bank activities), compared
with 3,917 million euros in 2016 on a historical basis, an increase of
22.0% or 861 million euros. On a historical basis, the increase was
largely attributable to:

= a reduction of 811 million euros in impairment losses on goodwill

reflected a still-uncertain political and economic context, a clear
decline in purchasing power, with its effects on consumption of
telecommunications products and services, and continued
regulatory pressure. In Niger, the impairment loss signaled an
uncertain political and economic context and the effects of strong
tax and regulatory pressure. In Luxembourg, the impairment loss
was an indication of strong competitive pressure,

attributable to Poland for 494 million euros, Egypt for 232 million
euros, the DRC for 109 million euros, Cameroon for 90 million
euros, Romania for 55 million euros, and Niger for 26 million
euros. In Poland, the impairment loss mainly reflects a decline in
competitiveness in the ADSL market, a deterioration in revenue
assumptions in the mobile market, and an increase in the post-tax
discount rate due to the downgrading of the country’s sovereign
rating by the rating agencies. In Egypt, the impairment loss
reflects the financial terms of the 4G license awarded in 2016,

the sharp depreciation of the Egyptian pound and increased
political and economic uncertainty. In the DRC, the impairment
loss reflects the political and economic uncertainty, a decline in
purchasing power with a knock-on effect on the consumption of
telecommunications products and services, and an increased
regulatory burden (particularly connected with the implementation
of customer identification). In Cameroon, the impairment loss
reflects a decline in voice revenue following the rise in messaging
services and in VoIP of Over-The-Top (OTT) providers, and
heightened competition in the mobile market. In Romania,
following the adoption of IFRS 15 with effect from 1 January 2016

the consolidated annual financial statements),

and the 118 million euro increase in depreciation and amortization
(see Note 8.1 to the consolidated annual financial statements).
This increase was largely attributable to (i) increased investment
in recent years, particularly in respect of very high-speed
broadband network rollout (4G and FTTH) in Europe, particularly
in France and Spain, (ii) the increase in the accelerated
depreciation of certain fixed assets in France, and (iii) the increased
depreciation of leased handsets, Livebox, and equipment installed

Analysis of the Group’s financial position and earnings

> 2018 vs 2017

The consolidated net income of the Orange group totaled 2,158 million
euros in 2018, compared with 2,040 million euros in 2017, an increase
of 118 million euros. This increase was chiefly attributable to:

= the 353 million euro improvement in net finance costs (see
Note 11.2 to the consolidated annual financial statements), most of
which came from the change in effects relating to the 321 million
euro investment in BT Group, with the recognition of a 51 million
euro expense in 2018, compared with a 372 million euro expense
in 2017 (see Note 11.7 to the consolidated annual financial
statements); and

the 51 million euros rise in operating income;

partially offset by the 257 million euro increase in income tax (see
Note 9.2 to the consolidated annual financial statements):

- the counter-effect in France in 2017 of (i) tax income of 304 million
euros relating to the dispute over the 3% dividend tax, (i) partially
offset by the additional income tax expense of 78 million euros
due to the exceptional surtax applicable to fiscal year 2017,

- and the recognition in Spain of a deferred tax expense of 86 million
euros in 2018 to reflect the negative effect of strong competitive
pressure on the recoverable amount of the deferred tax assets
recognized.

Non-controlling interests amounted to 204 million euros in 2018,
compared with 197 million euros in 2017 (see Note 13.6 to the
consolidated annual financial statements). After taking into account
non-controlling interests, the net income attributable to owners of the
parent company totaled 1,954 million euros in 2018, compared with
1,843 million euros in 2017, constituting a rise of 111 million euros.

> 2017 vs 2016

The consolidated net income of the Orange group totaled 2,040 million
euros in 2017, compared with 3,122 million euros in 2016, a decrease
of 1,082 million euros. This decline was chiefly attributable to:

= the counter-effect of the recognition in 2016 of a positive result of
2,253 million euros representing the net income of discontinued

operations, namely EE, (see Note 3.2 to the consolidated annual
financial statements), corresponding to (i) the gain on disposal of
2,080 million euros on EE, and (ii) dividends received from EE in
January 2016 (prior to disposal) in the amount of 173 million euros;

= and the 101 million euro increase in corporate income tax (see
Note 9.2 to the consolidated annual financial statements), which
was mainly due to the counter-effect of the recognition, in 2016, of
a 256 million euro deferred tax expense relating to Spain. This
charge reflected the reduction in deferred tax assets on the balance
sheet due to an adverse change to the rules governing the use of
tax loss carryforwards in Spain in 2016;

= partially offset by:
— the 861 million euro rise in operating income,

— and by the 382 million euro improvement in net finance costs (see
Note 11.2 to the consolidated annual financial statements), which
is chiefly attributable to (i) effects relating to the investment in BT
Group (see Note 11.7 to the consolidated annual financial
statements), with the recognition of a 372 million euro expense
in 2017, versus 533 million euros in 2016 (impairment of shares
partially offset by the effect of the hedging of foreign exchange
risk and dividends), (ii) improvement in the cost of gross financial
debt, due mainly to the reduction in interest on bond debt after
hedging effects, and (iii) improved financial foreign exchange
income.

Non-controlling interests amounted to 197 million euros in 2017,
compared with 309 million euros in 2016 (see Note 13.6 to the
consolidated annual financial statements). After taking into account
non-controlling interests, net income attributable to owners of the
parent company totaled 1,843 million euros in 2017, compared with
2,813 million euros in 2016, for a drop of 970 million euros.

higher CAPEX and, to a lesser extent, to the increase in investments
financed through finance leases, partially offset by the fall in acquisitions
of telecommunication licenses. Between 2016 and 2017, the decline

to revenue of telecoms activities was 17.9% in 2018, up 0.4 points on
both a historical and a comparable basis compared with 2017.

On a historical basis, the 3.2% or 233 million euro rise in Group
CAPEX between 2017 and 2018 reflected:

euros;

= which was more than offset by (i) the positive impact of changes in
the scope of consolidation and other changes, for 8 million euros,
and (ii) organic growth on a comparable basis, or an increase of
251 million euros in CAPEX.

On a comparable basis, the 3.5% or 251 million euro increase in
Group CAPEX between 2017 and 2018 was attributable mainly to:

= higher capital expenditure on very high-speed fixed broadband
networks (fiber, see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events), mainly in
France and, to a lesser extent, Africa & Middle East countries
(notably Jordan, Morocco and Senegal) and in Poland. In 2018,
Group capital expenditure benefited from co-financing from other
operators, mostly in France and Spain. At 31 December 2018,
32.5 million households had connectivity to very high-speed
broadband (an increase of 22.4% year-on-year), including
13.8 million in Spain, 11.8 million in France, 3.4 million in Poland,
and 2.3 million in Romania (following the mutual network sharing
agreement with Telekom Romania);

higher capital expenditure on very high-speed broadband mobile
networks (4G, see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events), mainly in
France and, to a lesser extent, Africa & Middle East countries
(notably Mali, Morocco and Senegal) and in Poland. At December 31,

Moldova. In Africa & Middle East, 12 countries (excluding associates
and joint ventures) had 4G coverage at the end of December 2018;

and, to a lesser extent, (i) the increase in investments in IT and
customer service platforms, mainly relating to transformation projects
in Spain, shared services, and the redesign of information systems
in Africa & Middle East countries, and (ii) additional investments in
network real estate, stores and other assets, mostly in Africa &
Middle East countries and for shared services (linked to the
adaptation and modernization of the real estate portfolio);

= partially offset by (i) the fall in investments in 2G/3G mobile networks
after significant capital expenditure in this area in recent years,
notably in Africa & Middle East countries, and (ii) declining investment
in leased terminals, Livebox and equipment installed on customer
premises, due in particular to the optimization of Livebox costs in
France and reduced customer project requirements for enterprise
services.

> 2017 vs 2016

In 2017, the CAPEX of the Orange group amounted to 7,209 million
euros (including 7,148 million euros for telecoms activities and 61 million
euros for Orange Bank activities), up 3.4% on a historical basis and
on a comparable basis compared with 2016. The ratio of CAPEX to
revenue of telecoms activities was 17.5% in 2017, up 0.4 percentage
points on ahistorical basis and 0.3 percentage points on a comparable
basis compared with 2016.

On a historical basis, the 3.4% or 238 million euro rise in Group

other changes, which totaled 23 million euros and mainly included
the effect of the acquisition of Airtel in Burkina Faso for 14 million
euros on June 22, 2016, (ii) partially offset by the negative impact
of foreign exchange fluctuations in the amount of 20 million euros,
chiefly attributable to changes in the value of the Egyptian pound
against the euro, resulting in an adverse impact of 27 million euros;

235 million euro increase in CAPEX.

On a comparable basis, the 3.4% or 235 million euro increase in
Group CAPEX between 2016 and 2017 was attributable mainly to:

= increased investment in very high-speed broadband mobile
networks (4G), mainly in Africa & Middle East countries (accelerated
rollouts, 4G coverage in 11 countries at the end of December 2017,
excluding associates and joint ventures), as well as in France and
Spain (network quality improvement in public spaces, tourist
destinations and transit networks);

= growing investment in very high-speed fixed broadband networks
(vDSL and FTTH), principally in France, Poland, Belgium, and
countries in Africa & Middle East;

= and, to a lesser extent, by Orange Bank's investments in IT, in
conjunction with the commercial launch of the Orange Bank offer

In 2018, acquisitions of telecommunication licenses (see Note 8.3 to
the consolidated annual financial statements) totaled 200 million euros
and mainly involved (i) Spain for 149 million euros (with the acquisition
of a 5G license for 142 million euros), (ii) the DRC for 21 million euros
(acquisition of a 4G license), and Senegal for 21 million euros (first
tranche of the acquisition of additional 4G frequency blocks).

In 2017, acquisitions of telecommunication licenses amounted to
318 million euros on a historical basis and mainly involved (i) Mali for
152 million euros (acquisition of a universal license renewing existing
licenses and including a 4G license), (ii) Senegal for 76 million euros
(second tranche of the acquisition of a universal license renewing
existing licenses and including a 4G license), and (iii) Jordan for
49 million euros (acquisition of additional 3G frequency blocks).

3.1.2.5.2 Investment commitments

Investment commitments are set out in Note 14 to the consolidated
annual financial statements.

3.1.2.5.3 Investment projects

As part of the Essentials2020 strategic plan, the Group will pursue its
strategy of differentiation by the quality of its networks and its customer
experience. This strategy is based on targeted investments that
reinforce the superiority of its networks and provide enhanced services.
In addition, the Group will rely on Lean CAPEX, its new investment
optimization program, with the goal of gradually reducing unit costs
by 15%. This will yield one billion euros in gross savings by 2020, which
will be partially reinvested, in line with the Group's objectives, to enable
Orange to accelerate its transformation. Group-wide, investments will
fall slightly after the peak recorded in 2018.

Investment will accelerate in FTTx fixed networks (fiber optic and
other very high-speed broadband technology) which provide very
high-speed broadband Internet access.in 2019. This will mainly
concern France and Spain, enabling the Group to remain the market
leader in very high-speed fixed broadband networks. In France, Orange

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

is confirming its central role in the rollout of very high-speed broadband,
with responsibility for 80% of the rollout in areas currently awaiting
FTTH investment. It is also pursuing its goal of giving 20 million
households and businesses connectivity by the end of 2021 in very
densely and moderately densely populated areas. In Spain, Orange
will maintain a robust level of very high-speed broadband rollout,
notably by maximizing infrastructure sharing agreements to optimize
costs. Orange has set itself the target of connecting nearly 16 million
households to very high-speed broadband by the end of 2020 (covering
almost 60% of Spanish households). In Poland, Orange is continuing
an ambitious investment plan to support its convergence strategy,
taking advantage of EU subsidies. Orange plans to step up fiber
connections with the aim of giving more than 5 million households.
connectivity by the end of 2020. In Romania, 2019 will see the rollout
of fiber to supplement existing coverage under the infrastructure
sharing agreement with Telekom Romania. In Slovakia, the fiber optic
network will continue to be rolled out in 2019. In Belgium, the
convergence strategy will continue to be rolled out through TV and
Internet offers developed on the cable network. In Moldova, rollout of
the very high-speed fixed broadband network will continue, extending
the existing coverage to support the convergence strategy.

Investments in 4G mobile networks will be pursued in 2019. The aim
is to exceed 96% coverage of the population in all European countries
in which Orange operates. In France, Orange will pursue its premium
mobile operator strategy by maintaining a sufficient rollout rate to
cover 99% of the population by the end of 2019. It will also increase
its network in rural areas to meet the regulatory commitments imposed
by the French telecoms regulator Arcep, on behalf of the government,
as part of the New Deal agreement (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant
events). In Spain, Orange will continue its 4G network rollout with
investments focusing increasingly on improving the customer
experience. In Poland, investments in 2019 and beyond will focus on
improving domestic coverage. In Romania and Slovakia, the Group
will continue to invest in order to improve population coverage rates.
Orange will also continue its 4G network rollout in Africa & Middle East
countries.

In addition, against a backdrop of strong growth in mobile Internet
traffic, the Group is actively preparing for the arrival of 5G technology.
In 2019, the rollout of 5G will take place on existing 4G sites with
Massive MIMO smart antenna technology (which boosts signal quality
for the user while reducing spurious background emissions). 5G will
be set up in 17 European cities in 2019 ahead of its launch in 2020,
once enough 5G smartphones are available (see Section 3.1.1.3
Significant events).

Lastly, as part of Orange’s goal to excel in customer relations, 883 Smart
Stores were open at the end of 2018 in 16 countries worldwide. The
Group's ambition is to open more than 1,400 Smart Stores in France,
Spain, Europe and Africa & Middle East countries by the end of 2020.

3.1.3

Changes in the presentation
of segment information

The new organization of Orange Group's Executive Committee
implemented with effect from May 2, 2018 (see Section 3.1.1.3
Significant events) has led the Group to review how its segment
information is presented, without changing the definition of its operating
segments (see Note 1.7 to the consolidated annual financial
statements).

Decisions regarding the allocation of resources and the assessment
of the performance of the various components of Orange are taken
by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating
decision-maker) at operating segment level, which are primarily
organized on a geographic basis. Thus, the operating segments are:

= France (excluding Enterprise);

= Spain;

Poland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and each of the Central European
countries (Moldova, Romania, and Slovakia). The Europe aggregate
encompasses the operating segments in that area;

the Sonatel subgroup (comprising the entities in Senegal, Mali,
Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone), the lvory Coast subgroup:
(combining the entities in the lvory Coast, Burkina Faso, and Liberia),

and each of the other countries in Africa & Middle East (mainly
Botswana, Cameroon, the Central African Republic (CAR), the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Egypt, Jordan,
Madagascar, Morocco, and Niger). The Africa & Middle East
aggregate shown includes the operating segments in that area;

Enterprise services, which covers communication solutions and
services for businesses in France and worldwide;

International Carriers & Shared Services (“IC & SS"), which
encompasses (i) the rollout of the international and long-distance
network, installation and maintenance of submarine cables, and
sales and services to international carriers, and (ii) shared services
including support and cross-divisional functions spanning the entire
Group (information systems, research and development and other
activities common to the Group), Content operations, and the
Orange brand;

= and Orange Bank.

Historical data, comparable basis data and customer bases for fiscal
years 2017 and 2016 have been restated to reflect this change.

> 2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 165 million euro increase in revenue in
France between 2017 and 2018 stemmed from () the positive impact
of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes amounting
to 2 million euros, and (ii) organic change on a comparable basis
representing a 163 million euro increase in revenue.

On a comparable basis, the 163 million euro increase in revenue in
France between 2017 and 2018 was mainly attributable to (i) the
positive effect of including digital reading offers (see Section 3.1.1.3
Significant events), (ii) convergent services revenue growth, (iii) the
development of fiber, particularly as part of the rollout and operation
of networks managed by local authorities, and (iv) to a lesser extent,
by the increase in equipment sales, (v) partially offset by the downward
trend in fixed only narrowband services (traditional telephony), the
anticipated fall in revenue from national roaming and the fall in regulated
prices for unbundling.

France’s mobile and fixed customer bases withstood the highly
competitive environment between 2017 and 2018, both on ahistorical
and comparable basis:

= the total mobile customer base contracted by only 0.4%
year-on-year, with 21.7 million customers at December 31, 2018.
Contract customers rose 2.1% year-on-year. This growth reflects
both (i) the growth in premium offers, with Open convergent offers
(which reached 9.3 million customers at December 31, 2018), and
(ii) the growth in entry-level offers, with the development of S/M-only
offers, including Sosh digital offers (which totaled 3.8 million
customers at December 31, 2018). In addition, there were
15.0 million 4G customers at December 31, 2018, an increase of
9.9% year-on-year;

the total fixed broadband customer base stood at 11.5 million
customers at December 31, 2018, up 2.1% year-on-year
(232,000 new customers). This growth was driven essentially by (i)

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

the development of fiber optic offers, which increased by 29.7%
(i.e. 593,000 new customers), for a total of 2.6 million customers at
December 31, 2018, and (ii) the momentum of convergent offers,
which grew by 2.6% and had 6.1 million customers at December 31,
2018. In addition, 7.0 million customers subscribed to IPTV and
satellite TV offers at December 31, 2018, up 2.7%.

On a comparable basis, the 413 million euro increase in revenue
from convergent services between the two periods was mainly attribu-
table to:

= the 2.6% year-on-year increase in the convergent customer base,
with 6.1 million customers at December 31, 2018. This growth in
volume, although negatively impacted by the discontinuation of
“Sosh+Livebox" convergent offers, is driven by the success of Open
Offers. It is also boosted by the rise in the number of mobile phones
per household, with 9.7 million convergent mobile customers at
December 31, 2018 (up 5.5% year-on-year), or 1.6 mobile phones
per convergent customer. Convergent customers represented
59.5% of the retail fixed broadband customer base at December 31,
2018;

= and the growth in value. In this respect, 12-month convergent
ARPO (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary) increased by 3.2%
between December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, mainly due
to the positive effect of including digital reading offers.

On a comparable basis, the 61 million euro decline in revenue from
mobile only services was mainly due to (i) the 4.7% reduction in the
mobile only customer base (because of the migration from contract
offers to convergent offers) and the structural decline in the prepaid
customer base, (ii) partially offset by the 1.7% growth in 12-month
mobile only ARPO (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary).

On a comparable basis, revenue from fixed only services fell by
176 million euros between the two periods, due to the downward
trend in traditional telephony (down by 11,4% or 207 million euros)


--- Page 88 ---

and customer migration to convergent offers. Revenue from fixed only
broadband services were up 1.2% year-on-year, driven by the 2.1%
growth in 12-month fixed only broadband ARPO (see Section 7.2.1
Financial glossary) and the 1.5% year-on-year increase in the fixed
only broadband customer base.

On a comparable basis, the 48 million euro decrease in revenue from
carrier services between the two periods was mainly due to:

= (i) the structural decline in national roaming revenue, and (i) the
decline in revenue from wholesale ADSL access, caused by lower
unbundling rates and accelerated migration of customers to very
high-speed broadband networks, especially FTTH. The number of
copper telephone lines sold to other operators totaled 13.1 million
at December 31, 2018, a decline of 4.6% year-on-year;

partially offset by the growth in revenue from the construction,
operation and sale of fiber optic networks.

On a comparable basis, the 24 million euro increase in revenue from
equipment sales between the two periods was largely due to higher
mobile equipment sales.

> 2017 vs 2016

On both a historical and a comparable basis, the 150 million euro
(0.8%) increase in revenue in France between 2016 and 2017 is
attributable chiefly to (i) growth in revenue from convergent services
and fixed carrier services, the favorable impact of including digital
reading offers since the beginning of October 2017, and the higher
equipment sales, (ii) partially offset by the downward trend in revenue
from fixed only narrowband services (traditional telephony), and the
contraction in revenue from mobile only services. Between the two.
periods, the effect of the end of additional roaming charges in EU
countries on June 15, 2017 is almost neutral on France's revenue, the
increase in visitor roaming making up almost entirely for the fall in
customer roaming.

Despite intense competition, France's mobile and fixed customer
bases grew between 2016 and 2017, both on a historical and
comparable basis:

= the total mobile customer base stood at 21.8 million customers at
December 31, 2017, up 0.6% year-on-year. Contract customers
rose 4.0% year-on-year. This growth reflects both (i) the growth in
premium offers, with Open convergent offers (which reached
8.7 million customers at December 31, 2017), and (ii) the growth in
entry-level offers, with the development of S/M-only offers, including
Sosh digital offers (which totaled 3.6 million customers at
December 31, 2017). In addition, there were 13.6 million 4G
customers at December 31, 2017, an increase of 20.8%
year-on-year;

= the total fixed broadband customer base stood at 11.2 million
customers at December 31, 2017, up 3.1% year-on-year
(339,000 new customers). This growth was driven essentially by (i)
the development of fiber optic offers, which rose by 37.6% (i.e.
546,000 new customers), with a total of 2.0 million customers at
December 31, 2017, and (ii) the momentum of convergent offers,
which grew by 8.5% and had 6.0 million customers at December 31,
2017, representing 59.3% of the retail fixed broadband customer

Financial Report — 3

base at that date. In addition, 6.9 million customers subscribed to
IPTV and satellite TV offers at December 31, 2017, up 3.8%.

On both a historical and a comparable basis, revenue from
convergent services rose 447 million euros (12.4%) year-on-year. This
growth reflects both:

= the 8.5% increase in the convergent customer base (466,000 new
customers year-on-year), driven by the momentum of Open premium
offers. At December 31, 2017, the number of SIM cards in
convergent offers had risen 11.7% year-on-year;

and the 1.3% increase in convergent ARPO over 12 months, which
benefited, particularly in the fourth quarter, from the positive effect
of the inclusion of digital reading offers since early October 2017.

On both a historical and a comparable basis, the 203 million euro
decline (i.e. a fall of 7.7%) in revenue for mobile only services was
mainly due to:

= the 6.3% contraction in the mobile only customer base, mainly due
to the migration of customers to more attractive convergent offers
and a 16.7% year-on-year decrease in prepaid offers;

= and a 1.8% year-on-year reduction in mobile only ARPO, despite
the favorable change in the customer mix as the decline in the
number of contract customers was less than for prepaid offers.

On both a historical basis and a comparable basis, the decrease of
223 million euros (or 4.9%) in revenue from fixed only services is due
to (i) the fall of 265 million euros (or 12.8%) in fixed only narrowband
services, on account of the downward trend in fixed telephony revenue,
(ii) partially offset by the 42 million euro (or 1.7%) growth in fixed only
broadband services.

The growth in revenue from fixed only broadband services between
the two periods arose from:

= the 3.7% increase in fixed only broadband ARPO over 12 months,
supported by (i) the growing proportion of fiber offers with higher
added value, and (ii) to a lesser extent, the favorable impact due to
the inclusion of digital reading offers since early October 2017;

= partially offset by the 2.4% contraction in the fixed only broadband
customer base year-on-year (a loss of 127,000 customers), mainly
due to the migration of customers to more attractive convergent
offers.

On both a historical and a comparable basis, the 94 million increase
(ie. 1.8%) in revenue for carrier services was mainly due to:

= (i) the increase in revenue related to the sale of wholesale ADSL
access, supported by the increase in unbundling tariffs, and (ii)
higher revenue from fiber optic infrastructure building and from
sharing these networks. The number of copper lines sold to other
carriers totaled 13.7 million at December 31, 2017, a decline of
1.9% year-on-year. This decline was partially offset by the growth
in the number of FTTH outlets sold to other operators;

= and increased revenue from visitor roaming and network sharing;

= partially offset by the anticipated fall in revenue from the national
roaming agreement.

Analysis of the Group’s financial position and earnings

3.1.3.1.2 Adjusted EBITDA - France

> 2018 vs 2017

Onahistorical basis, the 198 million euro increase in adjusted EBITDA
in France between 2017 and 2018 reflects (i) the negative impact of
changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 1 million
euros, and (ii) is more than offset by the organic change on a
comparable basis, i.e. a 197 million euro increase in adjusted EBITDA.

Between 2017 and 2018, adjusted EBITDA received a 111 million euro
boost from the inclusion of digital reading offers (see Section 3.1.1.3
Significant events), with a positive impact of 158 million euros in 2018
compared with 47 million euros in 2017.

On a comparable basis, the 197 million euro increase in adjusted
EBITDA in France between 2017 and 2018 was mainly attributable to:

= (i) 163 million euros in revenue growth, (ii) the fall in labor expenses,
resulting primarily from the lower average number of employees
(full-time equivalents) thanks to the ongoing transformation plans,
and (iii) to a lesser extent, the decrease in other operating expenses.
and the reduction in commercial expenses and content costs;

= partially offset by (i) the increase in other external purchases, largely
due to purchases for resale related to the operation of networks
managed by local authorities, and (ii) the reduction in other operating
income.

> 2017 vs 2016

Onahistorical basis, the 149 million euro increase in adjusted EBITDA
in France between 2016 and 2017 was attributable to (i) the 1 million
euro favorable impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and
other changes, and (ii) organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. a
148 million euro increase in adjusted EBITDA.

On a comparable basis, the 148 million euro increase in adjusted
EBITDA in France between 2016 and 2017 was mainly attributable to:

= lower labor expenses, resulting primarily from (i) the lower average
number of employees (full-time equivalents) permitted by the
acceleration of transformation plans, with a decline in interactions
in stores and in customer relations, and growth in digital actions,
and (ii) to a lesser extent, the counter-effect of the recognition of the
Orange Ambition 2016 Employee shareholding plan in 2016;

and the 150 million euro growth in revenue;

= partially offset by (i) the increased cost of content, due primarily to
new agreements, partnership extensions and renewals in the area
of content, allowing offer enhancement, and (ii) the reduction in
other operating income and expenses.

3.1.3.1.3 Operating income - France

> 2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 170 million euro decrease in operating
income in France between 2017 and 2018 was largely attributable to:

= (i) the 307 million euro increase in specific labor expenses, primarily
for the “Part-Time for Seniors” (TPS) plan (relating to agreements
onthe employment of older workers in France) and related bonuses,
particularly with the three-year extension of the plan in
December 2018 (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events), (ii) the
102 million euro increase in restructuring and integration costs, and

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

(iii) the 75 million euro increase in depreciation and amortization,
mainly linked to the increase in investments made in recent years
(including the rollout of fiber);

= partially offset by (i) the 198 million euro increase in adjusted EBITDA,
and (ii) the counter-effect of the recognition in 2017 of a 115 million
euro charge for significant litigation.

> 2017 vs 2016

On ahistorical basis, the 64 million euro increase in operating income
in France between 2016 and 2017 was largely attributable to:

= (i) the counter-effect of the recognition in 2016 of 166 million euros
in restructuring and integration costs, chiefly for streamlining the
distribution networks (see Section 3.1.2.2.1 Reported EBITDA), (ii)
the 128 million euro reduction in specific labor expenses, mainly for
French “Part-Time for Seniors” plans (TPS) and related bonuses,
and (iii) the 149 million euro increase in adjusted EBITDA;

= partially offset by:

— the 250 million euro increase in depreciation and amortization,
largely attributable to (i) increased investment in recent years for
the rollout of very high-speed fixed and mobile broadband
networks (4G and FTTH), (ii) accelerated depreciation of certain
fixed assets, and (iii) the depreciation of leased handsets, Livebox,
and equipment installed at customer premises,

— andby the recognition of a 115 million euro expense for significant
litigation.

3.1.3.1.4 CAPEX - France

> 2018 vs 2017

On both a historical and a comparable basis, the 205 million euro
increase in CAPEX in France between 2017 and 2018 was largely
attributable to increased investment in very high-speed fixed and
mobile broadband networks (fiber, which is co-financed by other
operators, and 4G - see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events). At
December 31, 2018, France thus had 11.8 million households with
very high-speed broadband connectivity, up 29.8% year-on-year. In
addition, the 4G network covered 98.6% of the population in France
at 31 December 2018, a rise of 2.7 percentage points year-on-year.

> 2017 vs 2016

Ona historical basis, the 30 million euro increase in CAPEX in France
between 2016 and 2017 was attributable to (i) the positive effect of
changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes, for 10 million
euros, and (ii) organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. a 20 million
euro increase in CAPEX.

On a comparable basis, the 20 million euro increase in CAPEX in
France between 2016 and 2017 was mainly attributable to the
increased investment in very high-speed fixed and mobile broadband
networks (4G and fiber).

3.1.3.1.5 Acquisitions of telecommunication
licenses — France

In 2018 and in 2016, no telecommunications license acquisition was
recognized in France. In 2017, acquisitions of telecommunication
licenses amounted to 11 million euros.

> 2018 vs 2017

On ahistorical basis, the 118 million euro increase in revenue in Spain
between 2017 and 2018 is attributable to (i) the positive impact of
changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes, amounting
to 1 million euros, and (ii) organic change on a comparable basis,
representing a 117 million euro increase in revenue.

On a comparable basis, the 117 million euro increase in revenue in
Spain between 2017 and 2018 is largely attributable to (i) the growth
in revenue from convergent services, (ii) the growth in revenue from
fixed carrier services, and (iii) to alesser extent, the increase in revenue
from equipment sales.

On a comparable basis, Spain's mobile and fixed customer bases
have withstood strong competition:

= the total mobile customer base stood at 16.2 million customers at
December 31, 2018, up 1.8% from December 31, 2017. Offers with
contracts totaled 13.5 million customers at December 31, 2018, up
2.3% year-on-year, whereas prepaid offers (amounting to 2.7 million
customers at December 31, 2018) recorded a 5.7% decline over
the same period. The number of 4G customers reached 9.8 million
at December 31, 2018, an increase of 4.7% year-on-year;

the total fixed broadband customer base totaled 4.1 million
customers at December 31, 2018. The very high-speed fixed
broadband customer base grew significantly, up 27.6% year-on-year
to stand at 2.9 million customers at December 31, 2018. At
December 31, 2018, digital television offers also grew by 14.5%
year-on-year. This was driven by content offers — particularly
enhanced TV offers with soccer and optional premium offers - and
led to a TV penetration rate of more than 17%.

On a comparable basis, the 65 million euro increase in revenue from
convergent services between the two periods mainly resulted from (i)
the continued expansion of convergent offers and (ii) the simultaneous.
growth of the corresponding customer base, which reached 3.1 million
customers at December 31, 2018, an increase of 1.1% year-on-year.
In parallel, 12-month convergent ARPO rose by 1.3% year-on-year.
Convergence offers now represent 84.7% of the retail fixed broadband
customer base at December 31, 2018.

On a comparable basis, the 16 million euro decrease in revenue from
mobile only services between the two periods was essentially caused
by the fall in revenue from prepaid offers, due to the 5.7% contraction
year-on-year in the number of prepaid customers. However, mobile
only ARPO grew by 0.8% for the 12 months to December 31, 2018,
while the mobile only customer base grew by 0.4% year-on-year.

Onacomparable basis, revenue from fixed only services sawa 5 million
euro decrease between December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018.
The decline in revenue from fixed only broadband and narrowband
services (down 6.6% year-on-year) was partially offset by the 30.4%
growth in revenue from enterprise solutions and fixed networks.
Furthermore, fixed only broadband ARPO over 12 months was up
2.3% year-on-year.

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

On a comparable basis, the 56 million euro increase in revenue from
carrier services between the two periods was driven by (i) the
development of very high-speed broadband access and national
roaming, (ii) partially offset by the decline in incoming mobile traffic
(impact of the cuts in call termination rates since February 2018).

On a comparable basis, revenue from equipment sales rose by
15 million euros between the two periods due to the improvement in
loT commercial activity (smart security).

> 2017 vs 2016

On both a historical and a comparable basis, the 322 million euro
increase (i.e. 6.6%) in Spain's revenue between 2016 and 2017 is
mainly due to (i) strong growth in revenue from convergent services,
driven by content offers and the development of very high-speed
broadband access, (ii) growth in revenue from carrier services (national
and visitor roaming), and (iii) to a lesser extent, the increase in revenue
from fixed only services and equipment sales.

On a comparable basis, Spain's mobile and fixed customer bases
grew between 2016 and 2017:

- the total mobile customer base stood at 15.9 million customers at
December 31, 2017, up 1.1% year-on-year. Contract customers
(excluding M2M) rose 1.8% year-on-year. In addition, there were
9.3 million 4G customers at December 31, 2017, an increase of
18.2% year-on-year;

the total fixed broadband customer base stood at 4.2 million
customers at December 31, 2017, up 0.5% year-on-year
(20,000 new customers). This growth was driven essentially by (i)
the expansion of the very high-speed fixed broadband customer
base, which increased by 40.4% (i.e. 650,000 new customers) to
total 2.3 million customers at December 31, 2017, andi (ii) the
momentum of convergent offers, which grew by 1.9% to 3.1 million
customers at December 31, 2017, equivalent to 83.1% of the retail
fixed broadband customer base at that date. In addition,
626,000 customers subscribed to IPTV and satellite TV offers at
December 31, 2017, up 23.4%.

On a comparable basis, revenue from convergent services rose
223 million euros (12.0%) year-on-year. This growth reflects both:

= the 6.5% increase in convergent ARPO over 12 months, benefiting
in particular from ongoing enhancement of offers;

= and the 1.9% growth in the convergent customer base (i.e.
57,000 new customers year-on-year), linked to (i) the momentum
of very high-speed broadband access, and (ii) the development of
content offers such as soccer championship broadcasts. At
December 31, 2017, the number of SIM cards in convergent offers
had risen 3.9% year-on-year.

On a comparable basis, the 31 million euro decline (i.e. a fall of 2.5%)
in revenue for mobile only services was mainly due to:


--- Page 92 ---

= the 0.5% contraction in the mobile only customer base, mainly due
to the migration of customers to more attractive convergent offers
and a 11.7% year-on-year decrease in prepaid offers;

= partially offset by the 1.2% increase year-on-year in mobile only
ARPO, boosted by ongoing offer enhancement.

On a comparable basis, the 26 million euro increase (i.e. 5.4%) in
revenue for fixed only services was mainly due to:

= the 3.8% growth in revenue from fixed only broadband services
between the two periods. The 3.3% decrease in the fixed only
broadband customer base (due in particular to the migration of
customers to more attractive convergent offers) is more than offset
by the 3.1% rise in fixed only broadband ARPO over 12 months;

= and by the growth in revenue from enterprise solutions and fixed
networks.

On a comparable basis, the increase of 78 million euros (11.6%) in
revenue from carrier services is mainly due to the growth in mobile
services provided to other carriers, with (i) the increase in national
roaming, and (ii) the increase in visitor roaming, impacted by the end
of additional roaming charges in EU countries on June 15, 2017.

On a comparable basis, the increase of 26 million euros (i.e. 4.0%) in
revenue from equipment sales was driven by the growth in mobile
equipment sales.

3.1.3.2.2 Adjusted EBITDA - Spain

> 2018 vs 2017

Onahistorical basis, the 133 million euro increase in adjusted EBITDA
in Spain between 2017 and 2018 can be attributed to (i) the positive
impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes
of 1 million euros, and (ii) organic growth on a comparable basis
amounting to an increase of 132 million euros in adjusted EBITDA.

On a comparable basis, the 132 million euro increase in adjusted
EBITDA in Spain between 2017 and 2018 mainly resulted from (i) the
117 million euro increase in revenue, (ii) the increase in other operating
income, mainly due to fixed asset disposals recognized in 2018, and
(iii) the decline in service fees and inter-operator costs (with a fall in
national mobile termination rates in February 2018), (iv) partly offset
by the increase in content costs, primarily due to soccer rights and
offer enhancement, in line with the commercial momentum.

> 2017 vs 2016

Onahistorical basis, the 216 million euro increase in adjusted EBITDA
in Spain between 2016 and 2017 can be attributed to (i) the positive
impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes
of 2 million euros, and (ii) organic growth on a comparable basis
amounting to an increase of 214 million euros in adjusted EBITDA.

On a comparable basis, the 214 million euro increase in adjusted
EBITDA in Spain between 2016 and 2017 is mainly due to growth in
revenue of 322 million euros, partially offset by (i) the increase in
commercial expenses and content costs, primarily as a result of the
increase in soccer-related rights, and (ii) the increase in network
expenses related to business development.

3.1.3.2.3 Operating income - Spain

> 2018 vs 2017

On ahistorical basis, the stability of Spain's operating income between
2017 and 2018 mainly stems from the 133 million euro increase in
adjusted EBITDA, largely offset by (i) the 97 million euro increase in
depreciation and amortization, essentially owing to increased
investment in recent years as part ofthe deployment of very high-speed
broadband networks (4G and fiber) and the increased depreciation of
leased handsets, Livebox, and equipment installed on customer
premises, and (ii) the recognition, in the first half of 2018, of a31 million
euro charge relating to significant litigation.

> 2017 vs 2016

On ahistorical basis, the 277 million euro increase in operating income
in Spain between 2016 and 2017 was primarily due to (i) the 216 million
euro increase in adjusted EBITDA, and (ii) the counter-effect of the
recognition in 2016 of 127 million euros in restructuring and integration
costs, largely due to employee departure plans and the cost of
integrating Jazztel (see Section 3.1.2.2.1 Reported EBITDA), (iii) partially
offset by the 62 million euro increase in depreciation and amortization,
chiefly attributable to increased investment in recent years for the very
high-speed fixed and mobile broadband networks (FTTH and 4G).

3.1.3.2.4 CAPEX - Spain

> 2018 vs 2017

On both a historical and a comparable basis, the 5 million euro
increase in CAPEX in Spain between 2017 and 2018 was largely
attributable to increased investment in information systems and service
platforms, offset by co-financing received from other carriers in very
high-speed broadband networks (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant
events).

> 2017 vs 2016

On both a historical and a comparable basis, the 29 million euro
increase in CAPEX in Spain between 2016 and 2017 was chiefly as a
result of increased investment in very high-speed mobile networks
(4G).
3.1.3.2.5 Acquisitions of telecommunication
licenses - Spain

In 2018, acquisitions of telecommunication licenses in Spainamounted
to 149 million euros and mainly corresponded to the acquisition of a
5G license (see Note 8.3 to the consolidated annual financial
statements). Acquisitions of telecommunication licenses in Spain
amounted (i) in 2017, to 10 million euros, and (ii) in 2016, to 51 million
euros for the acquisition of 4G frequency blocks in the 2,600 MHz and
3,500 MHz bands.

> 2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 109 million euro increase in revenue in
Europe between 2017 and 2018 stems from (i) foreign exchange gains
of 4 million euros, (ii) the favorable impact of changes in the scope of
consolidation and other changes for 11 million euros, and (iii) organic
change on a comparable basis, representing a 94 million increase in
revenue.

On a comparable basis, the 94 million euro increase in revenue from
Europe between 2017 and 2018 was mainly due to (i) the growth in
Convergent services (Poland, Belgium and Romania), and to a lesser
extent (ii) the increase in Integration and IT services, (iii) the growth in
Equipment Sales, and (iv) the growth in Carrier services (mainly in
Poland), (iv) partially offset by the decline in Mobile only services and
Fixed only services (mainly in Poland) and the decrease in Other
revenue.

On a comparable basis, the change in mobile and fixed customer
bases in Europe between 2017 and 2018 mainly reflects the good
progress in mobile and fixed customer bases in Poland, Belgium and
Luxembourg:

= the total mobile customer base was 33.8 million customers at
December 31, 2018, up 1.6% year-on-year, in line with the increase
in the mobile customer bases in Belgium and Poland. The growth
in contract offers (up 3.3% year-on-year) is driven by the growth in
convergent offers, particularly with the Love offers in Poland and
Belgium. The number of 4G customers reached 14.8 million at
December 31, 2018, up 22.3% year-on-year;

- the fixed broadband customer base reached 3.3 million at
December 31, 2018, up 10.5% year-on-year, due to the strong
growth in the very high-speed broadband customer base in all
European countries. This increase was mainly driven by (i) the
development of very high-speed broadband offers, particularly cable
offers in Belgium, and (ii) by convergent offers that continue to grow
with 382,000 new customers in one year, mainly in Poland and
Romania. Moreover, 1.8 million customers had subscribed to IPTV
and satellite TV offers at December 31, 2018, up 17.9% year-on-year.

Ona comparable basis, the 163 million euro increase in Convergent
services revenue mainly resulted from the migration of customers to
convergent offers in most European countries. The convergent
customer base grew by 30.3% year-on-year (mainly in Poland, Belgium
and Romania) and stood at 1.6 million customers at December 31,
2018. Convergent customers now make up 50.3% of the consumer
fixed broadband customer base at December 31, 2018, up 7.6 points
year-on-year.

On acomparable basis, the 58 million euro deterioration in Mobile only
services revenue between the two periods notably reflects the 0.7%
fall in the mobile only customer base, which is mainly due to the
migration of customers towards convergent offers in almost all
countries, and especially in Poland.

On a comparable basis, the 60 million euros decrease in Fixed only
services revenue (stemming for the most part from Poland) between
the two periods mainly resulted from (i) by the downward trend in
fixed-line telephony revenue in Poland and (ii) customer migration
towards convergent offers, which was very marked in Poland.

Onacomparable basis, the 29 million euro increase in IT and integration
services between the two periods was largely related to the enterprise
market in Poland.

On a comparable basis, the 17 million euro increase in revenue for
Carrier services between the two periods was largely related to (i) the
growth in national roaming (Poland, Slovakia), the growth in visitor
roaming (Belgium, Romania) and the increase in incoming mobile
traffic in Poland, (ii) partially offset by the decline in virtual mobile
network operators (MVNO) in Belgium.

On a comparable basis, the 21 million euro increase in Equipment
sales between the two periods stems from the growth in mobile
equipment sales, particularly in Romania, due to the increase in
smartphone penetration.

Ona comparable basis, the 18 million euro decrease in Other revenue
between the two periods mainly stems from the decline in other
revenues in Belgium, and to a lesser extent, in Poland despite the
development of energy offers.

Analysis of the Group’s financial position and earnings

> 2017 vs 2016

Onahistorical basis, the 96 million euro increase in revenue in Europe
between 2016 and 2017 stemmed from (i) foreign exchange gains of
72 million euros, due notably to exposure to the zloty compared to the
euro, and (ii) organic change on a comparable basis representing a
24 million euro increase in revenue.

On a comparable basis, the 24 million euro increase (i.e. 0.4%) in
revenue in Europe between 2016 and 2017 was mainly due to:

= (i) the increase in revenues for Convergent services, mainly in Poland
and Belgium, and to a lesser extent, (ii) by the increase in Equipment
sales in Romania, and (iii) by the increase in mobile Carrier services
in Poland and Romania;

= partially offset by (i) the decrease in revenue in Mobile only services
in almost all European countries, and (ii) the decline in revenue in
Fixed only services in Poland.

Between the two periods, the impact of the end of additional roaming
charges in European Union countries on June 15, 2017 has a slightly
unfavorable impact on Europe revenue, as the fall in customer roaming
is only partially offset by the increase in visitor roaming.

On a comparable basis, the change in mobile and fixed customer
bases in Europe between 2016 and 2017 mainly reflects the change
in customer bases in Poland:

= as at December 31, 2017, the total mobile customer base was
33.2 million customers, down 4.8% year-on-year, mainly in Poland
and Romania. Contract customers (excluding M2M) rose 2.4%
year-on-year. In addition, there were 12.1 million 4G customers at
December 31, 2017, an increase of 34.9% year-on-year;

the total fixed broadband customer base reached 3.0 million
customers at December 31, 2017, up 19.1% year-on-year (i.e.
474,000 new customers), mainly in Poland, Romania and Belgium.
This growth was driven essentially by (i) the development of the fixed
very high-speed broadband customer base, which doubled in one
year, totalling 488,000 customers at December 31, 2017 and (ii) the
positive momentum in Love convergent offers which grew by 68.2%
with 1.3 million customers at December 31, 2017. 1.5 million
customers had subscribed to IPTV and satellite TV offers at
December 31, 2017, up 15.9% year-on-year.

On a comparable basis, the 107 million euro (54.3%) increase in
Convergent services revenue between the two periods mainly resulted
from the appetite and migration of customers to convergent offers in
most European countries. The convergent customer base grew by
68.2% year-on-year (mainly in Poland, Romania and Belgium) and
stood at 1.3 million customers at December 31, 2017. Convergent
customers now make up 42.7% of the consumer fixed broadband
customer base at December 31, 2017, up 12.4 points year-on-year.

On a comparable basis, the 101 million euro (4.3%) deterioration in
Mobile only services revenue year-on-year mainly reflects the 8.0% fall
in the mobile only customer base, which is mainly due to (i) the
migration of customers towards convergent offers in almost all
countries, and especially in Poland, and (ii) the strong decline in prepaid
offers, due notably to the customer identification obligation in Poland
and Belgium.

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

On a comparable basis, the 63 million euros (7.7%) decrease in Fixed
only services revenue (stemming for the most part from Poland)
between the two periods mainly resulted from (i) by the downward
trend in fixed-line telephony revenue in Poland and (ii) customer
migration towards convergent offers, which was very marked in Poland.

On a comparable basis, the 20 million euro (18.0%) increase in IT and
integration services between the two periods was largely related to
the positive momentum in the enterprise services market in Poland.

On a comparable basis, the 40 million euro (3.7%) increase in Carrier
services revenue between the two periods resulted primarily from the
increased in mobile services to other carriers in Poland, Romania and
to a lesser extent, Slovakia. The growth in visitor roaming (due to the
impact of the end of additional roaming charges in European Union
countries on June 15, 2017) and the increase in incoming mobile traffic
notably offset the decrease in virtual mobile network operators (MVNO)
in Belgium.

On a comparable basis, the 41 million euro (5.1%) increase in
Equipment sales between the two periods stems from the growth in
mobile equipment sales in Romania, and to a lesser extent in Slovakia,
Belgium and Moldova, partially offset by the decrease in equipment
sales in Poland.

3.1.3.3.2 Adjusted EBITDA - Europe

> 2018 vs 2017

On ahistorical basis, the 52 million euro increase in adjusted EBITDA
in Europe between the 2017 and 2018 was attributable to (i) foreign
exchange gains of 2 million euros, (ii) the favorable effect of changes
in the scope of consolidation and other changes in the amount of
2 million euros, and (ii) organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. a
48 million euro increase in adjusted EBITDA.

On a comparable basis, the 48 million euro increase in adjusted
EBITDA for Europe between 2017 and 2018 can essentially be
attributed to:

= (i) the 94 million euro increase in revenue, (ii) gains on the disposal
of fixed assets, mainly in Poland, as part of the optimization of the
real estate portfolio, (iii) the reduction in commercial expenses,
mainly in Poland and (iv) the decrease in labor expenses, mainly in
Poland;

= Partially offset by (i) the increase in content costs, (ii) the increase in
network charges, corresponding mainly to the increase in network
access connection charges in Belgium, in line with the increase in
the customer base for cable offers in the country, and (iii) expenses
related to the development of energy sales in Poland.

> 2017 vs 2016

On a historical basis, the 102 million euro decrease in adjusted
EBITDA in Europe between the 2016 and 2017 includes (i) foreign
exchange gains of 20 million euros, (ii) organic change on acomparable
basis, i.e. a 122 million euro decrease in adjusted EBITDA.

On a comparable basis, the 122 million euro decrease in adjusted
EBITDA for Europe between 2016 and 2017 can essentially be
attributed to:


--- Page 96 ---

= (i) the increase in interconnection costs, mainly resulting from the
end of additional roaming charges in European Union countries on
June 15, 2017 which notably generated a very strong increase in
traffic volumes from customers towards other European countries,
(ii) the increase in labor expenses in Poland and Romania, and (iii)
the increase in network charges, in line with the development of
cable offers in Belgium;

partially offset by the 24 million euro increase in revenue.

3.1.3.3.3 Operating income - Europe

> 2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 99 million euros improvement in operating
income in Europe between 2017 and 2018 was mainly attributable to
(i) the 52 million euro increase in adjusted EBITDA, (ii) the 33 million
euro decrease in restructuring and integration costs and (iii) the
counter-effect of the recognition, in 2017, of 19 million euros in
impairment of goodwill relating to Luxembourg (see below 2017 vs
2016).

> 2017 vs 2016

On a historical basis, the 409 million euro increase in operating
income in Europe between 2016 and 2017 was largely attributable to:

= a reduction of 530 million euros in impairment of goodwill (see
Note 7 to the consolidated annual financial statements), relating to
the recognition of:

— in 2017, impairment of 19 million euros relating to Luxembourg,
mainly reflecting strong competitive pressure,

— in 2016, impairment of 549 million euros, relating to (i) Poland for
494 million euros and (ii) Romania for 55 million euros. In Poland,
this impairment loss mainly reflects a decline in competitiveness
in the ADSL market, a deterioration in revenue assumptions in
the mobile market, and an increase in the post-tax discount rate
due to the downgrading of the country’s sovereign rating by the
rating agencies. In Romania, following the adoption of IFRS 15 with
effect from 1 January 2016 (see Note 2.3.2 to the consolidated
annual financial statements), the Group reassessed the net
carrying amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) and recorded
a goodwill impairment loss of 55 million euros;

= partially offset by (i) the 102 million euro decrease in adjusted EBITDA
and (ii) the 24 million euro increase in restructuring and integration
costs, mainly due to departure plans for employees in Poland in
2017 (see section 3.1.2.2.1 Reported EBITDA).

3.1.3.3.4 CAPEX - Europe

> 2018 vs 2017

On ahistorical basis, the 56 million euro increase in CAPEX in Europe
between 2017 and 2018 stemmed from (i) foreign exchange gains of
1 million euros, (ii) the favorable impact of changes in the scope of
consolidation and other changes amounting to 1 million euros, and (iii)
organic change on a comparable basis representing a 54 million euro
increase in CAPEX.

On a comparable basis, the 54 million euro increase in CAPEX in
Europe between 2017 and 2018 resulted in particular from ongoing
investment in mobile and fixed very high-speed broadband networks.
(4G and FTTH, see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events), particularly in
Poland.

> 2017 vs 2016

On ahistorical basis, the 23 million euro increase in CAPEX in Europe
between the 2016 and 2017 was attributable to (i) foreign exchange
gains in the amount of 12 million euros, and (ii) organic change on a
comparable basis, i.e. an 11 million euro increase in CAPEX.

On a comparable basis, the 11 million euro increase in CAPEX in
Europe between 2016 and 2017 was mainly due to (i) ongoing
investment in mobile and fixed very high-speed broadband networks.
(FTTH) particularly in Poland and Slovakia, and the acceleration in
investments due to the development of convergent offers by cable in
Belgium (customer IT and equipment), (ii) partially offset by the decline
in investments in mobile networks after the significant deployments.

Acquisitions of telecommunication
licenses - Europe

In 2018, acquisitions of telecommunication licenses in Europe
amounted to 10 million euros, and mainly concerned Poland. In 2017,
no telecommunication license acquisition was recognized in Europe.

In 2016, acquisitions of telecommunication licenses in Europe
amounted to 728 million euros on a historical basis and concerned
(i) Poland for 719 million euros, with the acquisition of two 5 MHz
frequency blocks in the 800 MHz band and three 5 MHz frequency
blocks in the 2,600 MHz band, allocated to the very high-speed mobile
broadband (4G) network and (ii) Romania for 9 million euros.

> 2018 vs 2017

On ahistorical basis, the 160 million euros revenue increase in Africa
& Middle East between 2017 and 2018 included (i) foreign exchange
losses of 90 million euros, mainly due to fluctuations in the Egyptian
pound, the Moroccan dirham, the Jordanian dinar and, to a lesser
extent, the Guinean franc against the euro, (ii) more than offset by the
organic change on a comparable basis, representing a 250 million
euro increase in revenue.

On a comparable basis, the 250 million euros revenue increase in
Africa & Middle East countries between the 2017 and 2018 was mainly
due to the increase in revenue generated by (i) the Sonatel sub-group.
for 92 million euros (primarily driven by Guinea, Senegal and Mall, (ii)
Egypt for 54 million euros, (iii) the Ivory Coast sub-group (primarily
driven by Burkina Faso) for 39 million euros, (iv) Morocco for 33 million
euros and (v) Congo (DRC) for 29 million euros.

Ona comparable basis, revenue growth of 271 million euros in Mobile
only services reflects the commercial momentum of data services and
Orange Money, and the almost stability of outgoing voice services,
due notably to the development of abundance offers. Revenue for
Orange Money services amounted to 334 million euros at
December 31, 2018, up 39.8% year-on-year in line with the 25.3%
increase in the Orange Money active customer base (15.1 million
customers at December 31, 2018). The total customer base of Orange
Money stood at 39.2 million customers at December 31, 2018. The
mobile only customer base totaled 120.6 million customers at
December 31, 2018, down 0.7% compared to December 31, 2017.
Between the two periods, the growth in the mobile only customer base
in Africa and Middle East countries (excluding Egypt) was more than
offset by the decline in the mobile only customer base in Egypt,
resulting from the change in regulations in the country (related notably
to the impact of the change in the indirect distribution regulatory
framework).

On a comparable basis, the 13 million euros increase in revenue for
Fixed only services between the two periods, was mainly due to
revenue growth posted by fixed only broadband services in Morocco,
offsetting the decrease in voice usage, for the lvory Coast sub-group
and Jordan in particular.

Ona comparable basis, the 67 million euros reduction in revenue from
Carrier services between the two periods principally reflected the
reduction in services to international carriers and incoming mobile
traffic, particularly for the Sonatel sub-group.

> 2017 vs 2016

On a historical basis, the 215 million euro decrease in revenue in
Africa & Middle East between 2016 and 2017 was attributable to:

= the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations in the amount
of 550 million euros, primarily due to the performance of the Egyptian
pound against the euro;

= partially offset by (i) the positive effect of changes in the scope of
consolidation and other changes, which accounted for 186 million
euros related to the impact of entities acquired in Africa in 2016
(Airtel in Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone, Oasis (Tigo) in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Cellcom Telecommunication
in Liberia), and (ii) organic growth on a comparable basis for an
increase of 149 million euros in revenue.

On a comparable basis, the 149 million euro (3.0%) increase in
revenue in Africa & Middle East between 2016 and 2017 was mainly
a result of ()) the 91 million euro growth in revenue from the Sonatel
sub-group (driven mainly by Mali and Guinea), (ii) the 44 million euro
increase in revenue from the lvory Coast sub-group (driven by Burkina
Faso and Ivory Coast), and (iii) the 31 million euro gain in revenue in
Morocco, (iv) partially offset by the 18 million euro decline in revenue
in the Congo (DRC) in light notably of the country’s worsening economic
environment.

Analysis of the Group’s financial position and earnings

Onacomparable basis, the 225 million euro (6.7%) increase in revenue
for Mobile only services between the two periods is mainly driven by
the momentum in data services and Orange Money. The mobile only
customer base in Africa & Middle East stood at 121.4 million customers
at December 31, 2017, up 10.5% (i.e. 11.5 Million new customers)
from December 31, 2016, driven by contract and prepaid offers. This
increase was the result of more vigorous sales and the counter-effect
of the 2016 fiscal year, which had brought stricter customer identity
check requirements for prepaid offers in a number of countries. 4G
services, available in 11 countries (excluding associates and joint
ventures), counted 11.1 million customers at December 31, 2017.

Ona comparable basis, the 16 million euro increase (3.9%) in revenue
for Fixed only services between the two periods, reflects the growth
in fixed only broadband services and fixed enterprise networks, partially
offset by the decline in fixed only narrowband services. The total fixed
only broadband customer base totaled 797,000 customers at
December 31, 2017, up 5.8% year-on-year.

On a comparable basis, the 107 million euros (10.7%) reduction in
revenue from Carrier services between the two periods is principally
the result of the decline in fixed services to international carriers.

3.1.3.4.2 Adjusted EBITDA - Africa & Middle East

> 2018 vs 2017

On ahistorical basis, the 55 million euro increase in adjusted EBITDA
in Africa & Middle East between 2017 and 2018 included (i) foreign
exchange losses of 24 million euros and the unfavorable impact of
changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 3 million
euros, (ii) more than offset by organic change on a comparable basis,
representing a 82 million euro increase in adjusted EBITDA.

On a comparable basis, the 82 million euro increase in adjusted
EBITDA in Africa & Middle East between 2017 and 2018 was largely
attributable to:

= (i) 250 million euros in revenue growth, (ii) the fall in service fees and
inter-operator costs, and (iii) the reduction in operating taxes and
levies due to reversals on provisions for the extinction of tax risks
in 2018;

partially offset (i) by the growth in other network expenses and IT
expenses (primarily due to the increase in work taking place on
mobile sites, particularly the deployment of 4G sites) (ii) the increase
in commercial expenses (related in particular to the growth of Orange
Money), (iii) increased labor expenses, and (iv) the growth of other
external purchases (property expenses due to the development of
the network and overheads).

> 2017 vs 2016

On ahistorical basis, the 46 million euro decline in adjusted EBITDA
in Africa & Middle East between 2016 and 2017 was attributable to:

= the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations in the amount
of 187 million euros, primarily due to the performance of the Egyptian
pound against the euro;

partially offset by (i) the favorable impact of changes in the scope
of consolidation and other changes for 35 million euros,
corresponding to the impact of entities acquired in Africa in 2016
(Airtel in Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone, Oasis (Tigo) in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Cellcom Telecommunication
in Liberia), and (ii) organic growth on a comparable basis for an
increase of 106 million euros in adjusted EBITDA.

On a comparable basis, the 106 million euro increase in adjusted
EBITDA in Africa & Middle East between 2016 and 2017 was largely
attributable to:

= (i) 149 million euros in revenue growth, (ii) the drop in service fees
and inter-operator costs (in connection with changes in call
termination rates and voice usage), and (iii) the reduction in other

Orange — 2018 Registration Document

operating expenses benefiting from the counter-effect of the 2016
recognition of the negative operational exchange rate effect of the
Egyptian pound's depreciation;

= partially offset by (i) growth in commercial expenses (mainly related
to business growth, specifically of Orange Money and data services),
(ii) the increase in operating taxes and levies, and (iii) the increase
in other network expenses and IT expenses (mostly linked to
expanding the mobile network, particularly the rollout of 4G sites).

3.1.3.4.3 Operating income - Africa & Middle East

> 2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 137 million euro increase in operating
income in Africa & Middle East between 2017 and 2018 was largely
attributable to:

= areduction of 79 million euros in impairment losses on goodwill and
fixed assets (see Notes 7 and 8.2 to the consolidated annual financial
statements), relating to the recognition of:

— in 2018, (i) impairment loss for 56 million euros on Jordan, and
(ii) impairment loss on fixed assets for 43 million euros on Niger.
In Jordan, the goodwill impairment mainly reflects the effects of
an uncertain political and economic climate and of a strong
competitive pressure on fixed and mobile data markets. In Niger,
the telecommunications market continues to lose value in a
still-difficult business climate. The company is experiencing an
economic and financial situation that has led it, by precaution, to
recognize impairment of fixed assets to cover Orange’s exposure
according to the best current estimate,

in 2017, 181 million euros in impairment, mainly for Congo (DRC)
for 120 million euros and Niger for 52 million euros (see below
2017 vs 2016);

= and the 55 million euro increase in adjusted EBITDA.

> 2017 vs 2016

On a historical basis, the 454 million euro increase in operating
income in Africa & Middle East between 2016 and 2017 was largely
attributable to:

= areduction of 288 million euros in impairment losses on goodwill
and fixed assets (see Notes 7 and 8.2 to the consolidated annual
financial statements), relating to the recognition of:

- 181 million euros in impairment in 2017, primarily for the
Democratic Republic of the Congo for 120 million euros and
Niger for 52 million euros. In the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC), the impairment reflects a still uncertain political and
economic context; a clear decline in purchasing power, with its
effects on consumption of telecommunications products and
services; and steady regulatory pressure. In Niger, the impairment
speaks of an uncertain political and economic context and the
effects of strong tax and regulatory pressure,

— animpairment loss of 469 million euros in 2016, chiefly attributable
to Egypt for 232 million euros, Congo (DRC) for 109 million euros,
Cameroon for 90 million euros, and Niger for 26 million euros. In
Egypt, the impairment loss reflects the financial terms of the 4G
license awarded in 2016, the sharp depreciation of the Egyptian
pound and increased political and economic uncertainty. In the
DRC, the impairment loss reflects the political and economic
uncertainty, a decline in purchasing power with a knock-on effect
on the consumption of telecommunications products and
services, and an increased regulatory burden (particularly
connected with the implementation of customer identification).
In Cameroon, the impairment loss reflects a decline in voice
revenue following the rise in messaging services and in VoIP of
Over-The-Top (OTT) providers, and heightened competition in
the mobile market;

= the 154 million euro decrease in depreciation and amortization,
mainly due to the positive effect of the devaluation of the Egyptian
pound against the euro at end-2016;

= and the 59 million euro improvement in the share of profits (losses)
of associates and joint ventures, partially offset by the 46 million
euro decline in adjusted EBITDA.

3.1.3.4.4 CAPEX - Africa & Middle East

> 2018 vs 2017

On ahistorical basis, the 13 million euro decrease in CAPEX in Africa
& Middle East countries between 2017 and 2018 reflects (i) foreign
exchange losses of 22 million euros, (ii) in part offset by organic change
on a comparable basis, i.e. an increase of 9 million euros in CAPEX.

On a comparable basis, the 9 million euro increase in CAPEX for
Africa & Middle East countries between 2017 and 2018 was mainly
attributable to (i) the continuing investment in very high-speed mobile
and fixed broadband networks (4G and FTTH, see Section 3.1.1.3
Significant events) with, in particular, 12 countries with 4G coverage
(excluding associates and joint ventures) at December 31, 2018, (ii)
partially offset by the reduction in other investments (particularly 2G/3G.
mobile access networks after significant capital expenditure in this
area over the last few years).

> 2017 vs 2016

On a historical basis, the 59 million euro increase in CAPEX in Africa
& Middle East between 2016 and 2017 was attributable to:

= the favorable impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and
other changes, which represented 25 million euros and essentially
corresponded to the impact of entities acquired in Africa in 2016
(Airtel in Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone, Oasis (Tigo) in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Cellcom Telecommunication
in Liberia), which was more than offset by the negative effect of
foreign exchange fluctuations for 33 million euros;

= andorganic change on a comparable basis, representing a 67 million
euro increase in CAPEX.

On a comparable basis, the 67 million euro increase in CAPEX for
Africa & Middle East between 2016 and 2017 was mainly due to (i)
growth in investments in very high-speed broadband mobile networks.
(4G), with 4G rolled out in 11 countries (excluding associates and joint
ventures) at December 31, 2017 and (ii) to a lesser extent, the rollout
of fiber optic and network modernization in the entities acquired in 2016.
3.1.3.4.5 Acquisitions

of telecommunication licenses —
Africa & Middle East

In 2018, acquisitions of telecommunication licenses in Africa & Middle
East amounted to 42 million euros and mainly involved (i) Congo (DRC)
for 21 million euros (acquisition of a 4G license) and (ii) Senegal for
21 million euros (first tranche of the acquisition of an additional 4G

> 2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 41 million euro increase in Enterprise
revenue between 2017 and 2018 was due to:

= the positive impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and
other changes for 151 million euros, due mainly to the acquisitions
of Business & Decision, Basefarm and Enovacom (see
Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events);

= more than offset by (i) the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange
fluctuations for 94 million euros, mainly on account of the change
in the value of the US dollar against the euro, and (ii) the organic
change on a comparable basis, or a 16 million euro decrease in
revenue.

On a comparable basis, the 16 million euro decrease in Enterprise
revenue between 2017 and 2018 was attributable primarily to:

= (i) the 98 million euro decrease in revenue of Fixed only services, of
which 58 million euros for Voice services and 40 million euros for
Data services, and (ii) to a lesser extent, to the 24 million euro
decrease in revenue of Services and mobile equipment;

= mostly offset by the 106 million euro improvement to revenue of IT
& Integration services.

On a comparable basis, the 58 million reduction in Voice services
revenue (see definition above in table footer) between the two periods
reflected the downward trend in voice services, particularly conventional
fixed telephony (down by 6.4% year-on-year) and, to a lesser extent,
the decline in audio conference services.

Ona comparable basis, the 40 million euros reduction in revenue from
Data services (See definition above in table footer) between the two
periods is principally the result of the 25 million euro decline in satellite
broadcasting services, and the natural decline in conventional services.

On a comparable basis, the 106 million euro increase in !T and
integration services revenue between the two periods was mainly due
the growth of Cloud services (up 10.1% year-on-year) and security
services (up 12.3% year-on-year), together with the signing of new
contracts in 2018.

On a comparable basis, the 24 million euro decrease in revenue of
Services and mobile equipment (see definition above in table footer)
between the two periods results from (i) the 19 million euro decrease
in mobile equipment sales, mainly due to the counter-effect of a
significant contract during the second half of 2017 and (ii) the 8 million
euro decrease in the revenue of Mobile only services.

> 2017 vs 2016

On a historical basis, the 95 million euro decrease in Enterprise
revenue between 2016 and 2017 was due to (i) the adverse impact
of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for
25 million euros mainly due to the disposal of Fime, (ii) the negative
impact of foreign exchange fluctuations for 5 million euros and (iii)
organic change on a comparable basis, namely a 65 million euros
decrease in revenue.

On a comparable basis, the 65 million euro (0.9%) decrease of
Enterprise revenue between 2016 and 2017 was attributable to (i) the
150 million euros decline in revenue from Fixed only services, of which
85 million euros were in relation to Data services and 65 million euros
in relation to Voice services, (ii) partially offset by the 54 million euros
improvement in IT and integration services revenue and by the 31 million
euro growth in Services and mobile equipment.

On a comparable basis, this 65 million euro (4.3%) decline in revenue
of Voice services between the two periods reflects primarily (i) the
downward trend in conventional fixed telephony, and (i) to a lesser
extent, the decline in audio conference services and incoming traffic
for call centers, (iii) partially offset by growth in VoIP services.

On acomparable basis, the 85 million euro (3.0%) decrease in revenue
from Data services between the two periods mainly results from the
slowing in satellite broadcast services and the natural decline in
conventional network services.

On a comparable basis, the 54 million euro (2.6%) increase in revenue
of IT and integration services between the two periods was mainly due
the growth of Cloud services (up 21% year-on-year) and cyber security
services (up 19% year-on-year).

On a comparable basis, this growth of 31 million euros (3.2%) in
Services and mobile equipment revenue, between the two periods
reflects the rise in mobile equipment sales, due to a major contract in
the second half of 2017, partially offset by the decline in mobile only
services due to the negative effect of the end of additional roaming
charges in the European Union countries.

3.1.3.5.2 Adjusted EBITDA - Enterprise

> 2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 61 million euros decrease in Enterprise
adjusted EBITDA between 2017 and 2018 was due to (i) the adverse
effect of foreign exchange fluctuations, i.e. 10 million euros, completely
offset by the favorable impact of changes in the scope of consolidation
and other changes for 10 million euros and (ii) the organic change on
a comparable basis, i.e. a decline of 61 million euros in adjusted
EBITDA.

On a comparable basis, the 61 million euros reduction in Enterprise
adjusted EBITDA between 2017 and 2018 was mainly accounted for
by (i) increased labor expenses, principally related to the growth in the
average number of employees (full-time equivalents), (ii) the decrease
in other operating income and expenses and (iii) the 16 million euro
decrease in revenue, (iv) partially offset by lower service fees and
inter-operator costs.

> 2017 vs 2016

Onahistorical basis, the 30 million euro decrease in adjusted EBITDA
for Enterprise between 2016 and 2017 reflects (i) the adverse impact
of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes amounting
to 4 million euros, (ii) the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations.
for 2 million euros, and organic change on a comparable basis, being
a decrease of 24 million euros in adjusted EBITDA.

On a comparable basis, the 24 million euro decrease in adjusted
EBITDA for Enterprises between 2016 and 2017 can essentially be
attributed to:

= (i) the 65 million euro decline in revenue, (ii) the increase in commercial
expenses (handset purchases and other products sold), due to a
major mobile equipment sales contract in the second half of 2017,
and (iii) higher IT expenses, in connection with the expansion of IT
& integration services;

partially offset by (i) the decline in service fees and inter-operator
costs, mostly because of the slowdown in satellite broadcasting
services, and (ii) the decrease in other operating expenses.

3.1.3.5.3 Operating income - Enterprise

> 2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the decrease of 124 million euros in Enterprise
operating income between 2017 and 2018 is mainly explained (i) by
the 61 million euro decrease in adjusted EBITDA, (ii) the 53 million
euros increase in specific labor expenses, essentially relating to the
French “Part-Time for Seniors” plan (TPS, procedures in relation to
agreements on the employment of seniors in France) and related
bonuses, notably the renewal in December 2018 of these provisions
for three years (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events) and (iii) the
16 million euro increase in depreciation and amortization.

> 2017 vs 2016

On a historical basis, the 27 million euro decrease in operating
income for Enterprise between the two periods is mainly attributable
to (i) the counter-effect of recording net income of 47 million euros for
the review of the investments and business portfolio in 2016, mainly
related to the disposal of Fime for 49 million euros, and (ii) the 30 million
euro decrease in adjusted EBITDA, (iii) partially offset by the 41 million
euro decrease in restructuring and integration costs.

3.1.3.5.4 CAPEX - Enterprise

> 2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 29 million euros decrease in Enterprise
CAPEX between 2017 and 2018 reflected (i) the 5 million euros adverse
impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, more than offset by the
favorable impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other
changes for 8 million euros and (ii) the organic change on a comparable
basis, namely a 32 million euros reduction in CAPEX.

On a comparable basis, the 32 million euro decrease in Enterprise
CAPEX between 2017 and 2018 is due to lower customer project
requirements and the optimization of investments related to the network
and IT system.

> 2017 vs 2016

Onahistorical basis, the 46 million euro increase in Enterprise CAPEX
between the two periods reflected (i) the positive effect of foreign
exchange fluctuations, representing 1 million euros, more than offset
by the adverse impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and
other changes, totaling 2 million euros, and (ii) organic change on a
comparable basis, representing a 47 million euro increase in CAPEX.

On a comparable basis, the 47 million euro increase in Enterprise
CAPEX between 2016 and 2017 was mainly attributable to the
accelerated transformation of the IT system, and network virtualization.

On a historical basis, the 117 million euro decrease in International
Carriers & Shared Services revenue between 2017 and 2018 can be
attributed to (i) the adverse effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for
13 million euros, (ii) the negative impact of changes in the scope of
consolidation and other changes representing 5 million euros, and (ili)
organic change on a comparable basis, namely a 99 million euro
decrease in revenue.

On a comparable basis, the 99 million euro decrease in revenue of
International Carriers & Shared Services between 2017 and 2018 was
due to (i) the 118 million euro decline in the international Carrier
services, with in particular the decline in the voice market to Africa and

revenue.

> 2017 vs 2016

On a historical basis, the 161 million euro decrease in International
Carriers & Shared Services revenue between the two periods can be
attributed to (i) the adverse effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for
4 million euros, (ii) the negative impact of changes in the scope of

consolidation and other changes representing 2 million euros, and (iii)
organic change on a comparable basis, namely an 155 million euro
decrease in revenue.

Ona comparable basis, the 155 million euro decline in revenue from
International Carriers & Shared Services between 2016 and 2017 was
largely attributable to the 147 million euro decline in the international
Carrier services.

& Shared Services

> 2018 vs 2017

On ahistorical basis, the 33 million euros growth in adjusted EBITDA
of International Carriers & Shared Services between 2017 and 2018
can be attributed to (i) the positive effect of foreign exchange fluctuations
for 3 million euros, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes.
in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 2 million euros,
and (ii) the organic change on a comparable basis, namely a 32 million
euros increase in adjusted EBITDA.

Analysis of the Group’s financial position and earnings

On a comparable basis, the 32 million euros decrease in adjusted
EBITDA for International Carriers & Shared Services between 2017
and 2018 is mainly explained by (i) the fall in service fees and
inter-operator costs resulting from the declined in the international
carriers activity, and the increase in other operating income and
expenses, mainly due to the disposal of fixed assets (as part of the
realestate optimization), (ii) partly offset by the 99 million euro decrease
in revenue and by the increase in labor expenses.

> 2017 vs 2016

Onahistorical basis, the 22 million euro decrease in adjusted EBITDA
of International Carriers & Shared Services between 2016 and 2017
includes (i) foreign exchange gains of 12million euros and the favorable
impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes
of 1 million euros, (iii) more than offset by the organic change on a
comparable basis, i.e. a 35 million euro decrease in adjusted EBITDA.

On a comparable basis, the 35 million euro decline in adjusted
EBITDA for International Carriers & Shared Services between the two
periods was mainly attributable to (i) the 155 million euro decline in
revenue, (ii) lower brand development costs (mainly with the
counter-effect of the recognition in 2016 of the costs of rebranding in
Belgium, Egypt, and Morocco, and the costs of sponsoring the 2016
European Football Championship — euro 2016), and (iii) the decline in
other operating income and expenses, in particular due to lower
revenue from disposals of fixed assets, (iv) partially offset by the decline
in service fees and inter-operator costs, resulting from the decline in
services to international carriers.

3.1.3.6.3 Operating income - International
Carriers & Shared Services

> 2018 vs 2017

Onahistorical basis, the 185 million euro improvement in International
Carriers & Shared Services operating income between 2017 and 2018
was mainly attributable to (i) the counter-effect of the recognition, in
2017, of an expense of 156 million euros for significant litigation, (ii)
the 33 million euro increase in adjusted EBIDTA, (iii) the 23 million
reduction in restructuring and integration costs, mainly resulting from
the restoration of real estate and (iv) the positive 21 million euro effect
of the securities and activities portfolio, (v) partially offset by the
76 million euro increase in specific labor expenses, mainly due to the

3.1.3.7 Orange Bank

French “Part-Time for Seniors” plan (TPS, procedures in relation to
agreements on the employment of seniors in France) and associated
bonuses, notably with the renewal in December 2018 of these
provisions for three years (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).

> 2017 vs 2016

On ahistorical basis, the 139 million euro deterioration in International
Carriers & Shared Services operating income between 2016 and 2017
was mainly attributable to:

= (i) the recognition, in 2017, of 156 million euros in expenses for
significant litigation, and (ii) the 22 million euro drop in adjusted
EBITDA;

= partially offset by (i) the 23 million euro reduction in restructuring and
integration costs, chiefly for restructuring the real estate portfolio,
and (ii) the 20 million euro cut in specific labor expenses, mainly for
TPS (French Part-Time for Seniors) plans and related bonuses.
3.1.3.6.4 CAPEX - International Carriers
& Shared Services

> 2018 vs 2017

On both a historical and a comparable basis, the 34 million euro
increase in CAPEX for International Carriers & Shared Services between
2017 and 2018 was mainly due to (i) the increase in investments in
real estate projects (in line with the adaptation and modernization of
the real estate portfolio) and (ii) by the investments in submarine
cables, with in particular the Kanawa cable that connects French
Guyana, Martinique and Guadeloupe (see Section 1.3 Significant
events).

> 2017 vs 2016

On a historical basis, the 5 million euro increase in International
Carriers & Shared Services CAPEX between the two periods includes
(i) the adverse impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and
other changes representing 10 million euros, and (ii) organic change
on a comparable basis, i.e. a 15 million euro increase in CAPEX.

On a comparable basis, the 15 million euro increase in CAPEX for
International Carriers & Shared Services between 2016 and 2017 was
mainly due to the increase in investments in submarine cables,
particularly the Kanawa cable.

Orange launched its banking and digital solution, Orange Bank, in November 2017 in metropolitan France, before enriching its range with a
personal loan offering distributed to Orange Bank's customers in March 2018. Since October 2018, these products are also marketed in the

French overseas departments.

At December 31, 2018, 248,000 clients had subscribed to the Orange Bank offer (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).

Segment information for Orange Bank (operating income, investments.
in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets) is presented
in Notes 1.2 and 1.3 to the consolidated annual financial statements.

> 2018 vs 2017

On a historical basis, the 76 million euro deterioration in Orange
Bank's operating income between 2017 and 2018 was mainly
attributable to:

= the decrease in Net Banking Income (NBI, see Note 1.2 to the
consolidated annual financial statements), due mainly (i) to the costs
of acquiring new customers related to the increase in the volume
of accounts produced during the fiscal year and (ii) the decrease in
NBI from cash transactions;

= and the increase in operating expenses, resulting from the recent
launch of the Orange Bank offering (IT maintenance and
development, hiring, depreciation and amortization of the new
investments, etc.);

= partially offset by the counter-effect of the recognition of a loss of
27 million euros in 2017 due to the Groupama Bank (now Orange
Bank) takeover in 2016 (see Note 3.2 to the consolidated annual
financial statements).

On a historical basis, the 25 million euros decrease in Orange Bank
CAPEX between 2017 and 2018 reflects the 1 million euros adverse
impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes
and by the organic change on a comparable basis, namely a 24 million
euros reduction in CAPEX.

On a comparable basis, the decrease of 24 million euros in Orange
Bank CAPEX between 2017 and 2018 resulted mainly from lower
investments in 2018, as fiscal year 2017 had concentrated most of
the investments dedicated to the launch of the new bank offering.

> 2017 vs 2016

Fiscal year 2017 featured the preparation of the new banking and
digital solution, Orange Bank, which is available in metropolitan France
since November 2, 2017.

Financial Report — 3

Analysis of the Group’s financial position and earnings

On a historical basis, the operating income of Orange Bank was
negative 93 million euros in 2017, compared to a positive 85 million
euros in 2016, chiefly attributable to (i) integration of banking activities
over twelve months in 2017 compared to three months in 2016, (ii)
costs incurred (essentially external purchases and labor expenses) in
preparing the launch of the Orange Bank offer, and (iii) effects of the
takeover of Groupama Banque (since renamed Orange Bank), with
the recognition of a loss of 27 million euros in 2017, compared to a
profit of 97 million euros in 2016 (see Note 3.2 to the consolidated
annual financial statements).

On both a historical and a comparable basis, the 46 million euro
increase in Orange Bank's CAPEX between 2016 and 2017 was
primarily due to increased investment in IT, in connection with the
launch of the Orange Bank offer in the second half of 2017.

Assets, lial S and cash flows

The segment information pertaining to Orange Bank (operating income,
investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets,
assets, liabilities and cash flows) are presented in Note 1 to the
consolidated annual financial statements, and Orange Bank's activities
(financial assets and liabilities, management of market risks connected
with the activities, and unrecognized contractual commitments) are
described in Note 15 to the consolidated annual financial statements.

Outstanding loans and receivables to customers at December 31,
2018 came to 2.0 billion euros compared to 2.1 billion euros at
January 1, 2018 (after integration of the effects of the
IFRS 9 application). Retail loans made up 86.7% of that total. 45.5%
were consumer loans (see Note 15.1.1 to the consolidated annual
financial statements).

Outstanding payables to customers (deposits and savings) at
December 31, 2018 came to 3.4 billion euros, down 7.8% year-on-year.
This was composed mainly of retail deposits, which were down
primarily in response to the end of sales of Elancio financial products.
Institutional investors’ deposits made up less than half of the total (see
Note 15.1.2 to the consolidated annual financial statements).

In 2018, Orange pursued its policy of actively managing its working

primarily due to (i) counter-effects of the 3% tax on dividends in
2017, and particularly the repayment of € 304 million by the French
tax authorities in 2017 in relation to the dispute regarding this tax
(see Note 9.2 to the consolidated financial statements), and (ii) the
increase in down payments during the year due to the exhaustion

inventories in 2018 than in 2017;

Between 2016 and 2017, the 941 million euro increase in net cash

= the change in working capital requirement for 390 million euro,
resulting in large part from the counter-effect in 2016 of payment of
the 350 million euro fine from the French Competition Authority for
anti-competitive practices in the Enterprise market (see Consolidated
statement of cash flows, Notes 5.7 and 16.1 to the consolidated

due to the refund of 304 million euros by the French tax authorities
in 2017 for the dispute over the 3% tax on dividends (see Note 9.2 to

> 2018 vs 2017

Between 2017 and 2018, the 464 million euro increase in net cash
used in investing activities of telecoms activities was largely attributable
to:

= impacts of proceeds from the disposal of BT securities for 380 million
euros, with proceeds of 53 million euros in 2018, compared to
433 million euros in 2017 (amount net of costs, see Note 11.7 to

= the recognition of the 346 million euro escrow amount in 2018
relating to the Digicel dispute (see Notes 11.7 and 16.1 to the
consolidated annual financial statements);

= the 344 million euro increase in acquisitions and proceeds from
disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (net
of changes in the fixed asset payables), mainly in France, in line with
the growth in CAPEX between the two periods (see Section 3.1.2.5
Group capital expenditures);

= and the acquisition of Basefarm in 2018 for 230 million euros (see
Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events);

partly offset by the counter-effect on the 1,074 million euro increase
of investments at fair value (excluding cash equivalents) in 2017.

> 2017 vs 2016

Between 2016 and 2017, the 2,905 million euro increase in net cash
used in investing activities of telecoms activities was largely attributable
to:

= (i) the counter-effect of the recognition in 2016 of the cash portion
of the proceeds from the disposal of EE securities for 4,481 million
euros (proceeds from the transaction less costs), and (ii) the change
in equity investments and other financial assets (with an increase of
1,082 million euros in 2017 compared to an increase of 65 million
euros in 2016);

= partially offset by:

— the counter-effect of acquisitions of investment securities (net of
cash acquired) made in Africa in 2016, for a total of 1,120 million
euros (Airtel in Burkina Faso and in Sierra Leone, Oasis (Tigo) in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Cellcom
Telecommunications in Liberia, see Note 3.2 to the consolidated
annual financial statements),

— the 995 million euro decrease in acquisitions and proceeds from
disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
(net of the change in fixed asset payables), primarily due to the
acquisition of far fewer telecommunications licenses in 2017 than
in 2016 (primarily 4G licenses in Poland and in Egypt in 2016,
and the partial payment due on the 700 MHz license acquired in
France in 2015, payment for which is staggered from 2016 to
2018, see Section 3.1.2.5 Group capital expenditures),

— and the proceeds from the disposal of BT securities sold in 2017

issuance (see Notes 11.5 and 11.6 to the consolidated annual
financial statements);

= andthe net change in cash collateral (with an increase of 203 million

currencies (with an improvement in 2018 compared with a
deterioration in 2017), see Note 12.5 to the consolidated annual
financial statements);

3.1.4.2.4 Orange’s credit ratings

Orange's credit rating is an additional performance indicator used to
assess the Group's financial policy and risk management policy and,
in particular, its solvency and liquidity risk, and is not a substitute for
an analysis carried out by investors. Rating agencies revise the ratings
they assign on a regular basis. Any change in the rating could produce
an impact on the cost of future financing or restrict access to liquidity.

In addition, a change in Orange's credit rating will, for certain
outstanding financing, affect the compensation paid to investors via
aStep-up clause (Step-up: a clause that triggers an increase in interest
payments in the event of a downgrading of Orange's long-term credit
rating by the rating agencies, according to contractually defined
rules — this clause may also stipulate a downward revision of the
coupon interest rate in the event of an improvement in the rating, as
long as the interest rate does not drop below the initial interest rate
on the loan — see Note 12.3 to the consolidated annual financial
statements).

On June 27, 2018, the rating agency Japan Credit Rating upgraded
Orange's long-term debt rating from A- to A and correlatively revised
the outlook on Orange's long term debt from Positive to Stable.

Analysis of the Group’s financial position and earnings

3.1.5

In this document, other than the financial indicators reported in

Orange publishes financial indicators that are not defined by IFRS. As
described below, these figures are presented as additional information
and are not meant to be substitutes for or to be confused with financial
indicators as defined by IFRS.

3.1.5.1

In order to allow investors to track the annual changes in the Group's
operations, data on a comparable basis are presented for the previous.
period. The transition from data on a historical basis to data on a
comparable basis consists of keeping the results for the year ended
and restating the previous year in order to present financial data with
comparable methods, scope of consolidation and exchange rates
over comparable periods. Orange provides the details of the impact
of changes in method, scope of consolidation and exchange rates on
its key operating indicators in order to isolate the intrinsic business
impact. The method used is to apply to the data of the corresponding
period of the preceding year the methods and the scope of

significant litigations, specific labor expenses, review of the investments
and business portfolio, restructuring and integration costs and, where
appropriate, other specific items that are systematically specified (see
Note 1.7 to the consolidated annual financial statements).

Orange's management considers that the presentation of adjusted
EBITDA and reported EBITDA is pertinent because they are operating
performance indicators used internally by the Group (i) to manage and
assess its operating results and segment results, and (ii) to implement
its investments and resource allocation strategy. Adjusted EBITDA and
reported EBITDA, or similar management indicators used by Orange's
competitors, are indicators that are often disclosed and widely used
by analysts, investors and other players in the telecommunications
industry.

Adjusted EBITDA and reported EBITDA are not financial indicators
defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled indicators
used by other companies. They are provided as additional information

Analysis of the Group’s financial position and earnings

3.1.5.3 CAPEX

Investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
excluding telecommunication licenses and investments financed
through finance leases (hereinafter referred to as “CAPEX") represent
the acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
excluding telecommunication licenses and changes in fixed asset
payables, as presented in the Consolidated statement of cash flows
(investments financed through finance leases do not affect cash flows
upon acquisition). The calculation below shows the transition from
CAPEX to (i) acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets, excluding changes in the fixed asset payables, as
presented in the Consolidated statement of cash flows, and (ii)
investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
as presented in Note 1.3 to the consolidated annual financial
statements.

(1) Excluding change in the fixed asset payables.

CAPEX does not include investments financed through finance leases
(no effect on cash flow upon acquisition) and investments in
telecommunication licenses, the acquisition of these licenses not being
part of the daily monitoring of operating investments.

Orange's management considers that presenting CAPEX is relevant
because it is the indicator used internally by the Group in allocating
resources, SO as to measure the operating efficiency of the use of
investments in each of its operating segments.

CAPEX is not a financial indicator defined by IFRS and may not be
comparable to similarly-titled indicators used by other companies. It
is provided as additional information only and should not be considered
as a substitute for purchases of or investments in property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets.

3.1.5.4 Adjusted EBITDA - CAPEX

“Adjusted EBITDA — CAPEX” corresponds to adjusted EBITDA (see
Section 3.1.5.2 Adjusted EBITDA and reported EBITDA) less CAPEX
(see Section 3.1.5.3 CAPEX).

Orange's management considers that the presentation of “Adjusted
EBITDA-CAPEX" is pertinent because it is the operating performance
indicator used internally by the Group to (i) manage and assess its
operating results and segment results, and (ii) implement its investments.
and resource allocation strategy.

“Adjusted EBITDA — CAPEX” is not a financial indicator defined by
IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly-titled indicators used by
other companies. It is provided as additional information only and
should not be considered as a substitute for analysis of net cash
provided by operating activities and net cash allocated to the Group's
investing activities.

3.1.5.5

Net financial debt as defined and used by Orange does not include
Orange Bank activities, for which this concept is not relevant. It consists
of (a) financial liabilities excluding operating payables (translated into
euros at the year-end closing rate) including derivative instruments

Net financial debt

(assets and liabilities), less (b) cash collateral paid, cash, cash
equivalents and financial assets at fair value. Furthermore, financial
instruments designated as cash flow hedges included in net financial
debt are set up to hedge (among other) items that are not included in
it, such as future cash flows. Effects of these hedges are carried in
other comprehensive income. As a consequence, the portion of these
components related to unmatured hedging instruments is added to
gross financial debt to offset this temporary difference.

The breakdown of net financial debt is shown in Note 11.3 to the
consolidated annual financial statements.

Net financial debt is an indicator of financial position used by the
Group. Net financial debt is a frequently disclosed indicator. It is widely
used by analysts, investors, rating agencies and most groups in all
business sectors in Europe.

Net financial debt is not a financial indicator defined by IFRS and may
not be comparable to similarly-titled indicators used by other
companies. It is provided as additional information only and should
not be considered as a substitute for an analysis of all the Group's
assets and liabilities.

3.1.5.6 Ratio of net financial debt to adjusted
EBITDA of telecoms activities

The ratio of net financial debt to adjusted EBITDA of telecoms activities
is calculated as the ratio of the Group's net financial debt (see
Section 3.1.5.5 Net financial debt) to the adjusted EBITDA of telecoms.
activities (see Section 3.1.5.2 Adjusted EBITDA and reported EBITDA)
calculated over the previous 12 months. As the net financial debt (as
defined and used by Orange) does not include the Orange Bank
activities, for which this concept is not relevant, the net financial debt
is divided by the adjusted EBITDA of telecoms activities. In addition,
when changes in scope significantly affect the Group's net financial
debt at the end of the period, the calculation of the ratio of net financial
debt to adjusted EBITDA of telecoms activities is adjusted to take into
account the adjusted EBITDA of those entities over the previous
12 months.

Unrecognized contractual commitments

Unrecognized contractual commitments are described in Notes 14
and 15.3 to the consolidated annual financial statements.

Application of IFRS 16 at January 1, 2019

The Group will apply IFRS 16 “Leases” as from January 1, 2019 using
the simplified retrospective method, without restatement of
comparative periods (see Note 2.4.2 to the consolidated annual
financial statements). Whilst following current discussions under way
at the IFRIC and IASB, the Group estimates the effect on the opening
balance sheet between €5.5 billion and €6.5 billion euros resulting
from the recognition of the lease obligation and the right of use
associated with leases contracts. Furthermore, the Group will record
deferred taxes during the initial recognition of the right of use and the
lease obligation from the transition.

The effect on equity at January 1, 2019 should not be material.

New financial indicators in Q1 2019

As a result of the Group's application of IFRS 16 as from January 1,
2019, Orange must adapt its financial indicators not defined by IFRS.
As from the first quarter of 2019, the following financial indicators will
be used internally by the Group:

- EBITDA after Leases (known as “EBITDAaL”) will correspond to
consolidated net income of continuing operations before income

and more broadly to measure its financial strength. This ratio is
commonly used by companies in the telecommunications sector.

tax, before financial income excluding interest on rental liabilities and
liabilities related to the assets financed, before share of profits
(losses) of associates and joint ventures, before impairment of
goodwill and intangible and tangible assets, before reclassification
of translation adjustment from liquidated entities, before effects
resulting from business combinations, before depreciation and
amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets,
before the effects of significant litigations, before specific labor
expenses, before restructuring costs, before acquisition and
integration costs, and before review of the portfolio of assets,
securities and businesses;

economic CAPEX will correspond to (i) investments in property,
plant and equipment and_ intangible assets, excluding
telecommunications licenses and financed assets, and (ii) less the
selling prices of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
sold;

the “EBITDAaL - Economic CAPEX” indicator will correspond to
EBITDAaL (see above) less Economic CAPEX (see above);

net financial debt will exclude lease liabilities falling within the
scope of application of IFRS 16;

the ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL of telecoms activities
will be calculated on the basis of the Group's net financial debt (see
above) compared to the EBITDAal (see above) of telecoms activities,
calculated over the last 12 months.

Recent events

3.2.2 Outlook

Building on these strong results, the Orange group will mobilize its
ability to adapt to meet new challenges and continue its growth
trajectory.

The application of IFRS 16 “Leases” from January 1, 2019 (see
Note 2.4.2 to the consolidated annual financial statements) has
prompted the Group to review its financial indicators but does not
change Orange's targets, which are in line with the information provided
at the Investor Day held on December 7, 2017.

The financial indicators not defined by IFRS that will be used by the
Group from the first quarter of 2019 are described in Section 3.1.6
Additional information. On this basis, the Group's outlook is as follows:

- EBITDAaL (EBITDA after Leases) growth in 2019 will be lower than
that achieved in 2018, on acomparable basis. This can be explained
by a market environment that remains very competitive, particularly
in France and Spain, and by the end of the positive impact of
