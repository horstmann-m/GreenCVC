3.1 2012 MARKET TRENDS

3.1.1 Television

Television remained a highly attractive medium for the French population
in 2012, both on a daily basis and for major events. The development
of new technologies is opening up more possibilities, with a continuous
improvement in TV set image quality, an ever increasing choice of
channels, and additional services alongside live viewing via the web and
companion screens.

HIGH PENETRATION OF TV SETS ENCOURAGES
CONSUMPTION”

Almost every French home now has a TV set: 98% have at least one,
and of these 50% have more than one.

After setting a sales record in 2011 with 8.7 million units, TV set sales
naturally trended downwards in 2012, to 6.7 million

Television technology continues to modernise in French households.
81% now have a 16/9 set, and 80% a high-definition (HD) set, up six
points for the two functions in one year.

While the attractiveness of video equipment continues to rise, growth in
audio equipment is relatively flat, with 15% of homes equipped with a
home cinema system.

MULTI-CHANNEL ACCESS NOW THE NORM”

In fourth-quarter 2012, apart from the 1% of households receiving
television via analogue cable, all French households received at minimum
the 19 freeview DTT channels and 58% of them received a broader
channel offer via satellite, cable, ADSL or pay TV. This huge shift in the
French broadcasting landscape has happened quickly: at end 2006,
only 39% of homes with TV sets could access multi-channel offerings.

DTT is the most popular way of receiving television, with 59% of
homes having a DTT connection (i.e. an external or internal decoder
combined with a Yagi aerial). Since the end of the switch to all-digital,
this TV reception mode has declined slightly (by 1 point in one year), but
high-definition reception (HD DTT) is increasing at a brisk pace (45% of
households, up 11 points in one year).

ADSL/fibre optic ranks second. With 37% of homes connected, it
ranks far ahead of satellite and cable and remains the fastest-growing
reception mode, up 6 points in one year.

Satellite, the longest-standing reception mode, is stabilising (24% of
households, stable year-on-year), notably via pay subscriptions (13%,
stable), while free satellite is on the rise (12%, up 3 points).

Cable continues to decline (9%, down 1 point in one year), both for pay
offers (6%, down 1 point) and free offers (3%, down 1 point).

TELEVISION — THE TOP MEDIA CHOICE *

Overall, 81% of French people have at least one contact a day with
television, compared with 79% for radio and 43% for fixed Internet (via a
computer), giving television the broadest reach of all media.

Television also ranked highest in terms of time spent on media
consumption by French people during 2012. French people aged 15+
spent an average of 4 hours and 6 minutes a day watching TV, compared

with 2 hours and 15 minutes listening to the radio and 36 minutes surfing
the fixed Internet.

Television consumption continues to grow, setting a record in 2012
across all targets. For over 15s, consumption was up 4 minutes year
on year, compared with +3 minutes for radio and +4 minutes for fixed
Internet.

TV CONSUMPTION METHODS: CHANGING, BUT
SLOWLY?

New ways to watch TV are developing, but are still only marginal.

Only 2 minutes a day was spent watching live TV outside the home
(‘anywhere” viewing), just 0.8% of the level of traditional live viewing.

For non-TV set devices (computers, smartphones or touchscreen tablets
~ “any device” viewing) the average live viewing time was 1 minute a day,
or 0.4% of current live TV consumption.

In terms of non-live, or “anytime”, viewing, a distinction is made
between watching catch-up TV on sets, computers, smartphones and
tablets, amounting to 3 minutes a day or 1.1% of live TV consumption,

2012 market trends

The number of French web users continues to rise. The population is
spending more time on the Internet but visiting fewer different sites. In
December 2012 French web users went online an average of 57 times
in the month and visited an average of 112 different sites (compared
with 118 in 2011).

In December 2012 the average time spent online per month was
23 hours, compared with 22 hours and 28 minutes in December 2011.

NON-LIVE VIDEO CONSUMPTION
CATCH-UP TV

Catch-up remained the most popular consumption mode for programme
viewing in 2012. As such, 80% of TF1 programming is available on
MYTF1

In France, the average time spent per online video viewer in
December 2012 was 5 hours, up 1 hour and 30 minutes year on year.
The average number of videos watched was 89 per unique viewer.
France has 33.4 million online video viewers

In November 2012 Google/YouTube topped the rankings at 30 million
unique viewers; Dailymotion was second at 14 million. The brand
player” TF1/WAT attracted 10 million, putting it in third place in the
overall rankings and in second place in terms of total time spent, with an
average 1 hour and 45 minutes per video viewer per month

VIDEO ON DEMAND — VoD

The VoD market grew once again in 2012, reaching over €251 million
in consumer purchases, for a near 15% year-on-year increase. The
market grew 22% in terms of total consumer revenue excluding adult
programmes, on a consistent scope with the sector of physical video
transactions.

Awareness of VoD also rose once again in 2012, with nearly 9 in 10
French people saying they know about the service and nearly 1 in 3
saying they use it.

These increases are a result of the increased rate in the number of
households with ADSL, cable and fibre boxes, which rose 5 points year
on year to 70%, with an estimated 55% of households hooking their
boxes up to their TV sets (up 6 points on 2011). VoD has thus become
more visible and accessible for more VoD consumers on IPTV, a practice
that accounts for over 70% of total consumption in terms of value.

The most popular VoD programmes are recent cinema-release movies,
with a favourable market share for French films (especially in comedy),
which account for nearly 35% of films watched via VoD (compared with
24% of DVD and Blu-ray purchases).

By staking out its own territory alongside live and non-live TV viewing
while providing a growth source for the physical video market, VoD has
strong growth potential for the coming years. VoD revenues, including
SVoD subscriptions, are expected to reach €300 million in 2013 and top
the €400 million mark by 2015.

The arrival of new distribution media, especially connected TVs, game
consoles and tablets, opens up attractive growth prospects, as does
the development of new offerings like ESTVoD (Electronic Sell-Through
VoD) and definitive VoD (as opposed to rental VoD), which have become
a major focus of the big players in the sector.

TF1 is already looking at a range of solutions to tomorrow's demand
for VoD.

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
2012 market trends

SOCIAL MEDIA TRENDS”

Médiamétrie published the results of its second Social Networks survey
in July 2012.

The main finding was that the social networks are an immense success.
A full 99% of web users know of at least one social network, 77% are
registered users and 1.6 million users signed up in the last year. With the
complementary fit between the networks, web users join not one but
several, depending on what they want to do. Users are connected at all
times, out and about and even at their workplace.

Twitter made the biggest increase in 2012. More than 2 out of 3 web
users know the network and 15% are members. Initially the realm of
experienced users, the network has since benefitted from strong news
events. The latest arrival, Google+, is known by 7% of web users, yet
boasts almost as many registered users as Twitter.

Facebook continued to grow in France, attracting 32.3 million unique
visitors in December 2012, ahead of Microsoft, with 25.6 million.
Facebook remains behind Google and its 40.4 million unique visitors,
but unique visitors spend more time on Facebook, at 4 hours and
57 minutes a month. Facebook has topped the billion users mark
worldwide, of whom 25.6 million active users in France

Another leading social media, Twitter, has roughly 5.5 million users in
France (out of over 500 million registered users worldwide, 200 million
of whom are active users) and counted 4.4 million unique visitors in
December 2012. Visitor numbers grew 25% in France year on year.
Surprisingly, this growth was mainly driven by over 55s, whose numbers
rose 100% in one year (1.3 million accounts), as well as by 15-24 year-
olds (1.2 million, up 62%). France ranks seventh worldwide in Twitter
users, far behind the United States, Brazil, Japan, the UK and Indonesia.

Google+ reported sharp growth in 2012 with some 4.9 million
unique visitors in December 2012, up 60%. Google+ is relying on the
compatibility with the search engine's other services - Gmail, Chrome,
Maps, especially on mobile handsets — to increase market penetration.
From this standpoint, Google+, which today claims to have 400 million
members, of whom 100 million active members, could have a potential
1.5 billion users, ie. those from the other services (search, Gmail,
YouTube and so on) liable to switch over to the social networking site.

(2) The Player rankings record (by parent or brand) the number of unique video viewers who watched a video not only on a group or brana’s website, but also on a third-party website.
Consequently, Player data includes all pages where the player has a presence (in particular, via syndication and Facebook pages).

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
2012 market trends

The TF1 group now has around 11 million fans and 40 fan pages.

Facebook made a number of changes to its algorithm in 2012 that had
a negative impact on the visibility of posts on our fan pages. This impact
has been visible on our traffic from the social media since August 2012,
with a decrease in that traffic.

Through several leading programmes, including The Voice, Secret
Story, MasterChef and Danse avec les Stars, etc., TF1 is pursuing its
innovation strategy and going even further with social TV.

The Voice was the most connected entertainment programme in spring
2012. Two “V Reporters” working behind the scenes of the show and
actively in the social networks brought social media users live news
about the show all season long. The Facebook page (150,000 fans)
and Twitter account (80,000 followers) also presented exclusive content.
The songs featured on the show were available on iTunes, while every
Saturday night a catch-up tweet allowed web users to follow the live
action, synchronised with the best tweets from the community and the
stars of the show on MYTF1.

During Danse avec les Stars, web users were encouraged to make live
comments on the show and share their thoughts on the social media.
Their comments were included in the show, with the most representative
tweets broadcast on TF1 after each dance. In parallel, viewers could get
a behind-the-scenes experience of the show live on the official Twitter
account, the Instagram account and the programme fanpage. They
could interact with the stars, professional dancers, jury members and
hosts, who all have extremely active personal accounts. In “Your opinion
of prime time” (“Votre avis sur le prime”), a special report in the Danse
avec les Stars, la suite programme, a host presented the highlights
of show in the social networks, the most commented dances, and
the funniest tweets. At the end of the season, over 2.7 million tweets
had been posted about the programme and the programme's Twitter
account ranked number one in the entertainment show category with
some 80,000 followers.

USAGE AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES

DEVELOPMENTS IN TV SET TECHNOLOGY: MOVING TO EVEN
HIGHER-IMPACT TV”

Connected TV sets

Connected, or “Smart”, televisions continue to raise a number of issues,
including the real use made of this technology, the raising of market
awareness, competition with Internet operator set-top boxes, and the
need to adapt regulation to new viewing behaviour.

Over 1.6 million connected TV sets were sold in France in 2012, a
significant 8.9% increase on 2011. Sales are set to continue growing,
with connected TVs expected to account for almost all TV sales in five
years.

REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2012 FW]

The HbbTV trials launched in 2011 have changed dimension, with
almost all channels now having launched services. In July 2012 France
Télévisions released the Salto service on its channels, allowing viewers
to return to the start of their programme at any time. TF1 launched the
first synchronised HbbTV advertisement in France with the advertiser
Amaguiz.

Last year also saw the publication of “DTT 2.0" specifications by
France's “HD Forum”, setting forth the digital rights management
guidelines to be followed by service producers and TV manufacturers in
France. These guidelines are beginning to be adopted in other European
countries, including Spain, where the government approved this choice
in December.

3D and Ultra HD

Customers continued to lose interest in 3D in 2012. The number of 3D
cinema releases was stable but focused on major productions. However,
3D programmes came to the end of a cycle on television, disappearing
almost in their entirety. Sales of 3D sets rose by 63.7%, but this was a
result of range effect (the 3D function features on large-format TV set
ranges) rather than consumer demand.

3D may be flagging, but Ultra HD — featuring, as the name suggests,
higher-definition images — is starting to make name for itself. HD images
contain 1,920 pixels per line, while UHD images contain around 4,000,
hence the “4K Video” term generally used to describe these new
formats. The first 4K TV models arrived on the market in 2012, targeting
the very high-end segment. But caution remains the keyword for now, as
work on standardisation (new connections, contrast and colour settings)
has only just begun and compatible televisions will not be launched for
several years.

TV ON THE MOVE: COMPANION SCREENS AS TV SCREEN
EXTENSIONS

Smartphones, tablets and app stores

Smartphone ownership rates continue to rise and app stores are selling
more and more products. But the main stories in 2012 were the record
sales of tablets and the explosion in the number of device formats.

After the surprise success of tablets in 2012, consumer electronics
manufacturers impacted by the crisis and the fall in TV and PC sales
stepped up their efforts to develop innovative products. They launched
telephones close to the size of tablets (Samsung Galaxy Note) and
tablets closer to the size of telephones (iPad Mini) and PCs (Microsoft
Surface). Diversity was also the rule in prices and configurations, with
the entry-level segment scoring a big success at Christmas with prices
starting at €100.

The only group to resist the domination of the Apple and Google Android
ecosystems was Microsoft, which with Windows 8 is seeking to reinvent
itself with a new OS and interface (Metro). Initial sales have been modest
but it is still too early to measure the success of the new system.

3.1.3 Advertising

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
2012 market trends

TF1 continued to strengthen its MYTF1 offer in 2012. MYTF1 was
launched for Android and Windows 8 environments in addition to
the iOS environment covered for several years now. In all, more than
4.5 million MYTF1 downloads were made on smartphones and tablets.

The slowdown observed in advertising in second-half 2011 continued
in 2012.

Net plurimedia advertising revenues fell 4.6% in first-half 2012 with the
same trend expected in the second half of the year. Annual net IREP-
France Pub data will be published on March 20, 2013.

Gross investments were down slightly in 2012, by 0.6% year on year”),

The following data are gross. As such, they should be treated with
caution owing to the continuing strong pressure on prices in 2012, and
hence the differing scope for price negotiation in the various media.

TRENDS IN PLURIMEDIA ADVERTISING SPEND IN
201202

As mentioned above, plurimedia advertising spend in 2012 fell 0.6% on
2011.

Television (excluding sponsorship) was more than ever the top media,
accounting for 32.7% of gross plurimedia expenditure, up 1.5 points.
Revenues for television rose 4.2% in 2012 to €9.0 billion (largest
increase in gross value).

Within the TV category, incumbent channels continued on a positive
trend, with a 1.0% rise in gross spend to €5.4 billion. Freeview DTT
channels pursued their momentum, up 13.7% to €2.7 billion, but at a
slower pace than in 2011 (+28.4%). However, cable and satellite were
down 2.3% to €0.9 billion.

Gross advertising spend rose 3.8% in the first half of the year compared
with first-half 2011 while net spend for the same period was down 4.2%
year on year.

In terms of gross spend, print media remained the second-ranked
market with €7.5 billion despite a 2.7% contraction in revenues. The
market share of print media was down 0.6 points. The freesheet sector
was one of the few to post an improvement, up 6.3%, and now accounts
for 14.9% of print media revenues.

In terms of net spend, print media posted the biggest decline, down
8.1% on first-half 2011 (small ads included).

Gross spend in radio was up 3.7% to €4.3 billion. Market share also
rose, by 0.6 points to 15.6%. While the increase mainly came from
spend on music stations (up 2.4%) and general-interest stations (up
2.2%), local stations were also dynamic (up 16.9%) and now account
for 11.5% of radio spend.

According to the SRI group of advertising airtime sales agencies,
the Internet display advertising market (excluding search, affiliation,
directories, e-mails and comparison sites), was worth a net €649 million
in 2012. The market continues to grow (up 5% year on year in 2012), but
at a slower pace (up 11% year on year in 2011). The mobile Internet ad
market (mobile and tablet sites and apps) confirmed its extremely strong
growth, increasing 30% to €48 million net.

There were five major trends in 2012:

® the arrival of Ad exchanges, whose weight in the display market more
than doubled (7% of spend in 2012 compared with 3% in 2011). The
development of Ad exchanges appears to be a deep-seated trend
likely to continue in the coming years®.

Média, with Amaury Médias, Le Figaro Médias and Lagardére
Publicité, TF1 Publicité is reasserting its aim to enhance its digital
display inventory through improved audience qualification.

the particularly dynamic special operations segment (OPS) continued
to develop across all digital platforms. The special operations budgets
of advertisers rose 18% on 2011. Special operations are increasingly
multi-screen and multi-site, and have formats that are more engaging
and technically more elaborate.

By giving digital pride of place in its special operations systems,
TF1 Publicité brings advertisers a broad range of possibilities for
expression and interaction with their customers. TF1 Publicité is
continuously enhancing its offering by taking greater account of
the social networks and by taking full advantage of the special
characteristics of each screen.

= video (instream) continued to grow sharply in 2012 reaching
€90 million of revenues (up 50% on 2011) with an accelerated rise
in spend in the second half of the year (+60% in H2 2012 compared
with +40% in H1 2012). The strong momentum comes from high
demand, especially in catch-up TV, which is leading publishers to
draw up strategies to develop video content across all screens.

TF1 Publicité has a strong position in this segment, first of all with
MYTF1, which covers practically all TF1 programming between 6 pm
and midnight (excluding cinema) and is available on the web, mobiles,
tablets and connected TVs.

more and more households are being equipped with connected TVs.
The number of households with ADSL or fibre TV reception was up
22% year on year in October-December 2012, while the number of
households with a connected TV was up 84%").

TF1 Publicité is taking advantage of the specificities of this screen,
notably as part of the rollout of special operations. One of the most
decisive special operations in 2012 was the launch of a channel
dedicated to the Yves Rocher brand, available on MYTF1 via set-top
box operators.

mobile and tablet ownership rates are on the increase. As such,
advertisers are giving these technologies greater pride of place in their
communication plans.

TF1 Publicité has a strong position on this market and stands as a
leader in “second screens" with the introduction of innovative offerings
such as the partnership with Shazam (check-in). And with the launch
of MYTF1 “Connect”, TF1 is raising the bar even higher in terms of
screen synchronisation, both at editorial and advertising level.

3.1.4 Regulation

OUTLOOK FOR 2013

The economic environment was lacklustre in 2012 and is expected
to be much the same in 2013. GDP could stagnate or even fall (by
0.2% according to Xerfi forecasts), while unemployment is expected to
continue its rise.

That being so, France is not expected to benefit from the global recovery
in advertising spend, with some agencies even forecasting a decline in
spend in the country in 2013.

France would also seem to be something of a unique case internationally
speaking in that it is faced with a three-fold phenomenon:

= an expanding TV offering;
= an explosion in the digital offering, especially in video;
® a fall in advertising demand.

To cope with this market situation and prepare for an economic recovery,
TF1 Publicité is pursuing its strategy to segment its offering from a
cross-cutting standpoint and is conducting a comprehensive review
of multi-channel sales approaches with a view to adapting the value of
each segment.

To bolster the value of our offering in a deflationary market, TF1 Publicité
has brought the market a new demographic target, “Shoppers”, i.e.
working people with children aged under 25. Reflecting changing trends
in society and consumption, the new demographic covers buyers,
opinion leaders and consumers in the food sector and the goods and
services industry. The new target rounds out the range of tools for
measuring advertising effectiveness and returns that TF1 has provided
for a number of years.

In today's increasingly fragmented landscape, the TF1 channel continues
to hold a singular position thanks to its mass media strength and ability
to generate the greatest amount of impact with related targets.

TF1 Publicité today proposes a comprehensive television offering with its
new advertising responsibilities for HD1 and Numéro 23, which allow it
to cover the entire range of segments and audiences.

COMPENSATORY CHANNELS

Article 103 of Act 2007-309 of March 5, 2007 amending the Act of
September 30, 1986 established that the three analogue private channels
(TF1, M6, Canal+) would, on the complete close-down of analogue
television, be awarded an additional channel, called a “compensatory
channel”. However, following a complaint, the European Commission
addressed a formal demand to France on November 24, 2010 in which
it judged the attribution of these compensatory channels incompatible
with the European directives that form the European framework

applicable to electronic communications networks and services, known
as the “Telecoms Package”, because it would constitute a prohibited
special and exclusive right and would penalise competing operators. In a
substantiated opinion dated September 29, 2011, it called on France to
take all the necessary measures to put an end to this breach.

Taking account of this opinion, the French government decided to
repeal this system and on May 4, 2012 submitted Bill No. 515 on the
abrogation of compensatory DTT channels to the French Senate.

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
2012 activity and results

CONSOLIDATED REVENUE

The TF1 group was faced with a very challenging environment in 2012,
due in particular to the impact of the economic situation on advertising
spend.

However, thanks to a capacity for innovation and a good business mix,
the Group proved highly resilient to the tough conditions.

As a result, consolidated revenue held steady year-on-year, reaching
€2,620.6m in 2012 versus €2,619.7m in 2011.

Full-year revenue for 2012 comprised:

= €1,402.8m of advertising revenue from the TF1 channel, down
€101.3m (-6.7%), in an environment made turbulent by the impact of
the economic situation on advertising spend;

= €1,217.8m of revenue from other activities, up €102.2m year-on-
year (+9.2%), with most of the Group's other activities making a
contribution to this increase. Over the full year, the effect of 100% of
Metro France being included in the consolidation from July 28, 2011
largely offset the non-recurrence of the €13.3m generated by the
resale of Rugby World Cup rights booked in the third quarter of 2011.

Advertising revenue for the TF1 group as a whole reached €1,775.5m,
€46.0m (-2.5%) lower than in 2011. The drop in advertising revenue
from the TF1 channel was partly offset by the inclusion of Metro France
advertising, growth in advertising revenue for the DTT channels and
Eurosport International, and greater monetisation of online video.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Group generated consolidated revenue
of €767.7m, down €13.2m (-1.7%).

This comprised:

= €423.3m of advertising revenue from the TF1 channel, down €26.4m
(-5.9%) year-on-year. During the quarter, the TF1 channel continued
to suffer as adverse economic conditions deterred advertisers;

= €344.4m of revenue from other activities, a rise of €13.2m (+4.0%),
driven by good performances from TMC, NT1 and TF1 Entreprises in
particular.

The geographical split of full-year consolidated revenue in 2012 was
83% from France, 15% from the rest of the European Union, and 2%
from the rest of the world

PROGRAMMING COSTS AND OTHER OPERATING
COSTS

TF1 channel programming costs were €935.5m in 2012, versus
€905.5m in 2011. This €30.0m rise was due mainly to:

= increased scheduling of first-run drama nearing the end of rights
protection, to comply with regulatory requirements;

REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2012 FW]

= a beneficial rise in investment in terms of audience, particularly in the
5.30 p.m. - 8.50 p.m. slot.

The nine UEFA Euro 2012 matches screened in June and July 2012 cost
€24.2m. This compares with €24.1m for the 2011 Rugby World Cup,
which TF1 broadcast in the third and fourth quarters of 2011.

Sport programming costs (other than exceptional sporting events) fell by
7.0%, largely due to the non-screening of the UEFA Champions League
in the second half of 2012. The other genres saw programming costs
rise:

= entertainment, gameshows and magazine programmes (+6.4%),
reflecting increased scheduling of unscripted formats;

= drama and series (+5.1%), largely as a result of the screening early
in the year of first-run drama nearing the end of rights protection, to
comply with regulatory requirements;

= news (+3.8%), reflecting strong news flow in 2012, an election year
in France;

= films (+2.3%), as more feature films were screened in 2012.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, programming costs were down €16.8m
year-on-year, mainly due to the non-recurrence in 2012 of the Rugby
World Cup matches shown in October 2011 and to the savings
generated by the non-renewal of the UEFA Champions League
broadcasting contract. Excluding sporting events, programming costs
for the fourth quarter of 2012 were €5.9m lower than in the comparable
period of 2011.

Operating costs were up €19.6m at €1,342.6m, a major factor being
the impact of the acquisition of Metro France in the second half of 2011

At the start of 2012, the TF1 group launched phase II of its optimisation
plan, with the objective of generating €85m of recurring savings between
2012 and 2014. Pursuant to this Phase Il, the Group had already
achieved in 2012 recurring savings of €8m on the programming cost of
TF1, and €7m on overheads, therefore totalling €15m.

Net charges for depreciation, amortisation, provisions and impairment
amounted to €84.4m in 2012, €23.9 million lower than in 2011. In
2011, a high but non-recurring provision for risks and charges had been
booked.

CURRENT OPERATING PROFIT

The Group made a current operating profit of €258.1m in 2012, €24.8m
less than in 2011.

Operating margin was 9.8%, versus 10.8% a year earlier.

However, there was a further improvement in profitability for diversification
activities, whose operating margin reached 12.5% (versus 9.4% a year
earlier, an improvement of 3.1 points). This performance illustrates again
how in each successive quarter, these activities are proving to be a good
source of fresh earnings growth.


--- Page 16 ---

Bear in mind that 2012 full-year current operating profit includes
a €27.1m gain from a successful claim for reimbursement of CNC.
(National Centre for Cinematography) taxes, recognised in the first
quarter of 2012.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, current operating profit was €103.9m,
up €16.5m (+18.9%) on the fourth quarter of 2011. Current operating
margin was 13.5%, versus 11.2% in the fourth quarter of 2011, an
improvement of 2.3 points.

OPERATING PROFIT

The Group made an operating profit of €210.4m in 2012, €72.5m less
than in 2011. Operating margin was 8.0%, versus 10.8% in 2011

Operating profit for the year includes €47.7m of non-recurring expenses.
which consists of the costs incurred on Phase II of the optimisation plan,
and various other adaptation measures introduced during the year.

NET PROFIT

Cost of net debt was not material, since the TF1 group has no debt.

Other financial income and expenses showed net income of €5.8m
in 2012, a year-on-year rise of €0.7m. This reflects the fair value
remeasurement during the second quarter of 2012 of the call option
over TF1's 33.5% equity interest in the AB Group, which was granted
to Claude Berda in June 2010 and expired on June 10, 2012 without
having been exercised. With effect from June 11, 2012, the AB group
has been accounted for as an associate by the equity method.

Income tax expense for 2012 was €70.5m, versus €88.7m for 2011.

Associates contributed a net loss of €6.4m in 2012. This compares
with a loss of €13.7m a year earlier; most of this was attributable to a
provision of €8.0m taken against the investment in Metro France, which
at that time was 34,3% held by TF1 and accounted for by the equity
method. Metro France has been fully consolidated since July 28, 2011.

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
2012 activity and results

Net profit attributable to minority interests was €3.3m in 2012, compared
with €3.4m in 2011

Net profit attributable to the Group therefore came to €136.0m in 2012,
versus €182.7m in 2011. Fourth-quarter net profit amounted to €48.4m
in 2012, versus €57.5m in 2011

FINANCIAL POSITION

TF1 had shareholders’ equity of €1,801.8m as of December 31, 2012,
out of a balance sheet total of €3,617.8m.

Shareholders’ equity attributable to the Group was €1,684.8m as of
December 31, 2012

On December 31, 2012, the Group had a net cash surplus of €236.3m,
compared with a net debt of €40.6m on December 31, 2011. The cash
surplus at end 2012 includes the cash proceeds in connection with
the acquisition by the Discovery group of a 20% equity interest in the
Eurosport group (based on an enterprise value of €170m) and a 20%
stake in the TV Breizh, Histoire, Ushuaia TV and Stylia channels (based
on an enterprise value of €14m).

Note that net debt at end-2011 included €58.5m spent by TF1 to acquire
a previously rented building occupied by staff from TF1 SA and LCl.

As of December 31, 2012, the TF1 group had confirmed bilateral credit
facilities of €1,040m with various banks, versus €1,015m at end-2011.

These facilities are renewed regularly as they expire (terms of up to 5
years, depending on the facility), so that the Group has sufficient liquidity
at all times.

On July 24, 2012, the Standard & Poor's financial ratings agency
reiterated TF1's rating of BBB+, stable outlook.

The financial position of the TF1 group remains very healthy.

TF”
Sales of TV sets in France, after reaching an all-time high of 8.7 million in
2011, slipped back to 6.7 million in 2012.

The average daily viewing time increased again, reaching 3 hours 50
minutes for individuals aged 4 and over (3 minutes more than in 2011).

Among the target audience of “women aged under 50 purchasing
decision-makers”, the average viewing time was 3 hours 58 minutes, up
2 minutes year-on-year.

The terrestrial analogue signal was switched off on November 30, 2011,
which means that virtually 100% of French people with a TV set can now
access a multi-channel offering, so that they can as a minimum receive
the 19 first-wave free-to-air DTT channels. And 58% of them can access
a broader range of channels via satellite, cable, ADSL or pay-to-view
DTT.

Market leadership confirmed

The TF1 channel took an audience share of 22.7% among individuals
aged 4 and over (versus 23.7% in 2011), rising to 25.5% among
“women aged under 50 purchasing decision-makers” (versus 26.7%).
The channel's 8.5 point positive gap over the following channel in this
key target market is maintained.

Over 2012 as a whole, the TF1 channel attracted 88 of the top 100
audiences across all programmes. It also enjoyed the biggest single
audience on any channel with 13.3 million for Les Enfoirés on March 16,
another all-time high for this show. TF1 retained its unrivalled position,
upholding its reputation as the must-see channel by attracting over
9 million viewers for 26 of its programmes, and over 10 million for 6 of
them.

TF1 has adapted its positioning to compete with the broader range of
free-to-air TV channels.

The priority is to be a star performer in the 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. band.
These slots have high audience potential, and hence high monetisation
potential. Over this time band, TF1 has a higher audience share than
over the day as a whole, with 23.7% among individuals aged 4 and
over and 27.9% among the target audience of “women aged under 50
purchasing decision-makers”, representing an extra 1.0 and 2.4 points
respectively versus the day as a whole.

TF1 is using innovation to refresh its flagship brands and strengthen its
regular programmes. The TF1 editorial policy, built on popular, must-see
programming, has enabled the channel to achieve the no.1 spot across
all its genres. What is more, TF1 achieved the top 10 audience ratings in
entertainment, French drama, films, American series and news.

TF1 channel viewing figures have been on an uptrend since
September 2012. During the last 4 months of the year, the channel drew
an average audience share of 23.2% among individuals aged 4 and
over, rising to 26.0% for “women aged under 50 purchasing decision-
makers”, opening up a 9.0 point positive gap over the following channel
in this key target market.

Prime time market leader

The TF1 channel had an average prime time audience of 6.0 million in
2012.

Within TF1's prime time slots, the channel was the most-watched
channel on 8 out of 10 evenings.

So despite audience dispersion, TF1 retains its unrivalled position as a
mass media player in France.
No. 1 across all genres “

Entertainment: Les Enfoirés was watched by 13.3 million viewers on
March 16.

Another success was the Saturday prime-time show The Voice,
launched in 2012, with an audience peak of 9.3 million and an average
audience share of 47% among “women aged under 50 purchasing
decision-makers” and 34% among individuals aged 4 and over.

American series: Mentalist drew up to 10.1 million viewers, and House
(French title: Dr House) up to 9.1 million.

French drama: 2012 confirmed the dynamism of French drama, with
Profilage attracting up to 7.8 million viewers (the best for a detective

up to 7.5 million

Films: TF1 achieved excellent results for its film screenings. Highlights
included Gran Torino (9.4 million viewers, the best audience for a film
since November 2010) and Les bronzés font du ski (9.0 million viewers).

Sport: the final of the UEFA Euro 2012 football tournament was viewed
by 12.9 million people, an all-time high for a Euro tournament match not
involving the French national team.

News: TF1’s daily news bulletins are the most widely-watched in
Europe: the 8 p.m. bulletin attracted up to 9.8 million viewers and the
1 p.m. bulletin up to 8.3 million. An ambitious editorial strategy driven by
news editors and the arrival of new presenters gave fresh impetus both
to the flagship evening news bulletin (Le Journal Télévisé du 20h) and to
the channel's news coverage generally, and brought larger audiences for
TF1 news programming.

Advertising revenue”
Gross plurimedia advertising spend (including the Internet) in 2012 fell
by 0.6% to €27.5bn.

Television (national and regional channels, DTT, cable and satellite)
remains the no. 1 medium in terms of advertising spend, with market
share of 32.7% and gross revenue of €9.0bn in 2012, a year-on-year rise
of 4.2%. Advertising spend on free-to-air DTT is still growing rapidly (up
by 13.7% or €328.6m).

Print media still ranks second behind TV in France, with gross advertising
revenue of €7.5bn, 2.7% lower than in 2011.

Gross revenue for the TF1 channel was up 2.2% year-on-year in 2012.
The channel's share of gross advertising revenue across the TV market
as a whole was 36.5%.

Some sectors increased their gross advertising spend during 2012:
Cosmetics & Beauty (+4.3%), Retail (+29.2%), Telecoms (+7.5%), Travel
& Tourism (+13.3%), Household Cleaning (+3.7%), Healthcare (+1.6%)
and Apparel (+9.4%). Sectors in decline during 2012 were Food (-1.99%),
Auto (-2.2%), Banking & Insurance (-12.2%), Culture & Leisure (-12.7%)
and Publishing (-8.2%).

Net advertising revenue for the TF1 channel was €1,402.8m in 2012,
6.7% lower than in 2011. This reflects the effect of the climate of
uncertainty on advertisers’ spending decisions. In response, the Group's
advertising sales business has adopted a strategy designed to bolster
demand.

UEFA Euro 2012

During the second and third quarters of 2012, TF1 showed the UEFA
Euro 2012 football tournament. This was a major event for the Group,
which achieved excellent performances across all its media platforms
throughout the tournament.

The nine matches screened on the TF1 channel attracted an average
of 8.3 million viewers, representing an audience share of 34% among
individuals aged 4 and over.

Both of the matches involving France shown on TF1 attracted over
10 million viewers: 10.3 million for the match against England, and
11.3 million for the quarter-final against Spain.

The Spain/Italy final achieved the best audience rating for the competition
on any channel, pulling in 12.9 million viewers on July 1, 2012, giving an
audience share of 47.5% among individuals aged 4 and over.

Coverage was rolled our across all of the MYTF1 platforms. MYTF1
offered every match in the tournament plus catch-up of 9 matches,
exclusive video content, and an array of tie-in articles and packages.

The dedicated Euro 2012 website deployed jointly by TF1 and Eurosport
recorded 11.5 million hits and over 6.6 million videos watched.

The site also offered live coverage of the 9 games shown on TF1 using
an innovative player that enabled users to control the live feed, plus the
“Cover it live” feature with added editorial content.

Many users took advantage of cutting-edge social TV features, the
France/Spain match generating hundreds of thousands of live sessions.
Videos and highlights packages also proved very popular.

REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2012 FW]

The 360 strategy adopted for the tournament was an unqualified
success.

In financial terms, the impact of the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament on
TF1 channel programming costs over the full year (including rights and
production costs) was €24.2m for the 9 matches broadcast, giving an
average cost per match of €2.7m (versus €3.9m per match for the 2008
tournament).

HOME SHOPPING”

After contracting by 0.2% in 2011, the French retail sector as a whole
shrank by 2.9% in 2012. However, the home shopping market grew by
2% over the same period.

During 2012, sales over the Internet increased by 19% in value terms
to €45bn, versus €38bn in 2011, confirming the vitality of e-commerce
in France. Over the year as a whole, 514 million sales transactions were
made on websites, versus 420 million in 2011, a rise of 22.4%.

The TF1 group's Home Shopping arm generated revenue of €99.3m
in 2012, versus €100.4m in 2011, a slight drop (-1.1%). Good
performances at stores and the Place des Tendances e-commerce
site were offset by lower revenue at Infomercials and at the flagship
Teéléshopping brand.

Current operating profit for 2012 was up €3.9m year-on-year at €6.8m.
This performance reflects the commercial success of the business, tight
cost control, and a favourable comparative base (largely due to the
impact on 2012 profits of the divestment of 1000 Listes, which took
place in 2011).

THEME CHANNELS”

The terrestrial and satellite analogue signal was switched off on
November 30, 2011, which means that virtually 100% of French people
with a TV set can now access a multi-channel offering.

In 2012, the first-wave free-to-air DTT channels had a combined
audience share of 22.0% among individuals aged 4 and over, versus
21.4% a year earlier and 18.3% two years earlier.

Collectively, the pay-TV channels available in the French market attracted
acombined audience share of 11.2% in 2012, down 0.5 of a point year-
on-year.

Since January 1, 2012, the TF1 group’s pay theme channels have been
distributed in France on a non-exclusive basis to pay-TV operators,
which has increased their initialisation rate.

Theme channel revenue for 2012 was €320.3m, up 3.7% year-on-
year. Growth was driven by free-to-air channels, especially NT1, which
enjoyed a dynamic year.

Theme channel advertising revenue advanced by €12.7m (+6.9%).

Current operating profit was €31.9m in 2012, a year-on-year fall of
€7.0m, mainly due to LCI (on lower distribution revenue and a busy start
to the year in news), plus increased programming spend at TMC and
NT1 and the launch of HD1 and despite an improvement of Eurosport
France.

™C

TMC recorded an audience share of 3.6% among individuals aged 4 and
over in 2012 (versus 3.5% in 2011), rising to 4.0% among “women aged
under 50 purchasing decision-makers” (versus 3.9% in 2011).

TMC was France's leading DTT channel in 2012, cementing its ranking
as the 5" most popular national channel among individuals aged 4 and
over.

The channel had an average prime time audience of 800,000 and was
the most popular channel for films, magazines and entertainment. TMC.
had 5 of the top 10 DTT audiences in 2012.

The channel recorded the two highest audience ratings for DTT in the
year, the best being for the film Bodyguard, with over 2 million viewers.

NT1
NT1 saw strong growth in audience share in 2012, both among
individuals aged 4 and over (+11%) and “women aged under 50
purchasing decision-makers” (+13%). NT1’s share of these target
audiences was 2.1% and 2.7% respectively (versus 1.9% and 2.4% in
2011).

The channel had an average prime time audience of 600,000 (100,000
more than in 2011).

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
2012 activity and results

NT1 also attracted over 1 million viewers on 40 occasions in 2012
(versus 12 in 2011); viewing figures peaked at 1.8 million for the film The
Bourne Supremacy (French title: La mort dans /a peau).

These fine performances vindicate the positioning and programming
strategy of NT1, which has not only strengthened its schedules but also
benefited from working with the TF1 group's programming teams.

Eurosport France

The Eurosport France channel recorded strong growth in its paying
subscriber base to 8.8 million (versus 7.7 million in 2011, a rise of
14.1%). A major factor was the opening up of the channel to distribution
by internet service providers following the end of CanalSat exclusivity.

The Eurosport channel audience was 18% higher than in the previous
wave for the primary target audience (men aged 15 to 49). Eurosport 2
was similarly dynamic, with the strongest audience growth of any sport
channel as viewing figures doubled year-on-year.

Subscription revenue rose year-on year. However, advertising revenue
fell, reflecting the harsh economic environment and tougher competition,
and despite a rise in internet advertising revenue.

Programming costs were higher year-on-year as schedules were
enhanced, in particular with the screening of the London Olympics in the
third quarter of 2012.

TV Breizh

France's no. 1 general-interest pay-TV cable and satellite mini-channel,
TV Breizh confirmed its market-leading position, with an audience share
of 1.3% among individuals aged 4 and over.

In difficult competitive and economic conditions, TV Breizh achieved
revenue growth and is continuing its efforts to maintain profitability levels.

Lcl

In 2012, LCI continued with its editorial stance, focused on analysis and
explanation of news stories.

A feature of the year was the editorial approach to the French presidential
election campaign; this involved an array of special programmes, plus
searching in-depth analysis of news stories and innovative formats such
as Parole de Premiers (a regular show in which former Prime Ministers
commented on campaign issues) and Vu d’Ailleurs (on how the French
political scene is viewed from other countries).

LCI further emphasised its upmarket positioning at the start of the
autumn season with the launch of a new cutting-edge arts programme
(La semaine de I'art) and two new politics shows (A /‘épreuve des faits
and Ainsi va I'Amérique)

Discovery Division
The Discovery division recorded revenue growth over 2012 as a whole.

Histoire is pursuing its editorial policy focused on intellectual debate and
the commemoration of major historical events, and continues to build
brand recognition. Ushuaia TV, the sustainable development channel,

in environmental protection, and is stepping up its policy of screening
new documentaries. More than 60% of the channel's output is in HD
Native. Stylia has rapidly become a force to be reckoned with in lifestyle,
luxury and fashion pay-TV thanks to an ambitious production policy.

TF6 and Série Club

Revenue for these channels, owned 50/50 by TF1 and M6, grew
year-on-year. Both channels continued to adjust their cost base, and
improved their margins relative to 2011.

TF1 ENTREPRISES

TF1 Entreprises reported revenue of €56.9m for 2012, 15.2% more than
for 2011.

Current operating profit for the year was €10.9m, a year-on-year rise of
91.2%. Current operating margin was 19.2%, compared with 11.5% in
2011, an improvement of 7.7 points.

TF1 Entreprises scored many successes across all of its ventures.

Games")

The market for board and card games contracted by 3.4% in 2012
relative to 2011

TF1 Games saw its market share shrink slightly, from 7.7% to 7.4%.

The refreshment of the TV games range with the launch of Money Drop
and Les 12 coups de midi helped TF1 Games achieve 11 products in
the top 100 for 2012 sales, including 3 new launches. One big success
was its latest addition to the 1000 Bornes range: 1000 Bornes As du
volant.

Physical sales fell by 11.9%, while related rights rose by 7.5%. The digital
market expanded by 13.0% to €125m, representing 25.6% of sales.

In this shrinking market, TF1 musical productions achieved striking
success (Les Stentors, Vincent Niclo and the original soundtrack to the
film /ntouchables).

TF1 Entreprises was also a partner in shows like Disney on Ice, and
for standout artists of 2012 such as Céline Dion and Johnny Hallyday.
The company also developed its role as co-producer of exhibitions and
shows, including the musical 1789, Les amants de /a Bastille, which
attracted a total audience of 220,000 in Paris.

Licensing

The Licensing business continues to do well, driven by the ongoing
success of brands such as Barbapapa, Ushuaia, Hello Kitty and
Masterchef. The collection of Tintin figurines continued to perform well
throughout 2012.

PRODUCTION

Revenue for the Production business fell by 2.7% in 2012 to €25.7m.
Current operating profit was €2.4m, €2.0m lower than in 2011.

TF1 Films Production

After an exceptional 2011, cinema attendances fell by 5.9% in 2012 to
204.3 million. However, this is still well ahead of the average over the past
10 years, and 2012 was the fourth year running in which total box office
entries topped 200 million (versus a 10-year average of 193.2 million).
French films again enjoyed a healthy market share in 2012 at 40.2%,
after an exceptionally good 2011 (41.6%)

TF1 Films Production recorded a slight decline in revenue, because
fewer co-produced films went on general release than in 2011.

During 2012, 14 films co-produced by TF1 Films Production went on
general release (versus 21 in 2011), of which 8 attracted more than
a million box office entries (versus 13 in 2011).

TF1 Production

TF1 Production reported lower revenue in 2012, due partly to the
discontinuation of some of the programmes produced in 2011 and
partly to seasonal effects. There was only one season of Danse avec les
stars in 2012, as opposed to two in 2011

However, TF1 Production produced new episodes of the series A/S for
the TF1 core channel during the period, and also continued to produce
shows launched in late 2011 (such as Aprés le 20h c'est Canteloup).
TF1 Production increased its volume of output for TMC and NT1, and
also handled production of the UEFA Euro 2012 football tournament for
TFA.

e-TF1

Revenue at e-TF1 saw strong growth in 2012, to €101.3m (up 19.2%
on 2011).

Performances were very strong in all areas, including interactivity with
the TF1 channel and MYTF1, which continues to be a success in both
revenue and profitability terms.

Top-line growth and further cost control helped the business double
its current operating profit to €18.3m (versus €9.2m in 2011). Current
operating margin reached 18.1% in 2012, against 10.8% in 2011.

This success — in terms of traffic, revenue and profits - provides further
vindication of the TF1 Digital strategy.

Metro France

The gross print media advertising market shrank by 2.7% relative to
2011. Daily news freesheets recorded further growth, up 6.0% year-on-
year. Metro France posted a 16.2% gross revenue growth in 2012. Its
market share reached 27.3%, up 2.3 points on the previous year. By
contrast, 20 Minutes took a 44.3% share (down 0.2 of a point on 2011)
and Direct Matin was at 28.4% (down 2.1 points).

Third-party advertising airtime sales

Radio advertising saw growth of 3.7%. Gross advertising spend on the
radio stations for which TF1 Publicité sells airtime was 13.1% higher
than in 2011, and the company’s gross market share gained 1.0 point to
12.7% on national radio.

AUDIOVISUAL RIGHTS

The Audiovisual Rights Division posted revenue of €129.8m in 2012, a
year-on-year rise of 12.4%.

Current operating profit was €3.2m, up €43.3m versus 2011.

CATALOGUE

For an overview of the French cinema market in 2011, see the comments
on TF1 Films Production.

The Catalogue business generated 2012 revenue of €45.7m, versus
€37.2m in 2011 (+22.8%). This growth was due to a rise in general
release films.

Profitability improved sharply in 2012, with current operating profit
reaching €2.9m. This compares with a current operating loss of €28.4m
in 2011, most of which was due to the recognition, in the second and
third quarters of 2011, of a provision relating to the Miracle at St. Anna
litigation.

TF1 VIDEO”

In 2012, the physical and digital video market shrank by 7.8% versus
2011, to €1.3bn. Blu-ray and VoD sales were sharply higher, but failed
to offset a marked fall in DVD revenue. Revenue from Blu-ray was
€224m (+7.2% year-on-year), while VoD sales reached €225m (+13.1%
year-on-year). In 2012, Blu-ray unit sales passed the 10 million mark,
and 43 million pay VoD transactions were recorded. DVD remains the
preferred media among consumers, representing over two-thirds of the
market and a sales value of €892m (14.9% lower than in 2011).

TF1 Vidéo responded to these challenging market conditions by
embarking on a rationalisation process, which led to (i) the implementation
of a job protection plan and (ii) the signature of a distribution agreement
with Paramount Home Media Distribution France on July 13, 2012.

Full-year revenues for the Video business in 2012 were up 7.4% at

to the screening of the London Olympics. Current operating margin was
once again robust, at 14.2%.

Revenue growth was boosted both by subscriptions (up 7.3%) and
advertising (up 18.4%). Eurosport International advertising revenue
defied the tough European economic climate, surging to €88.7m on the
back of a busy and attractive schedule of sporting events (especially the
Africa Cup of Nations and Euro 2012 football tournaments, the French
Open of tennis and the London Olympics) and buoyant audience ratings.

At end December 2012, the Eurosport channel was being received in
131.8 million homes across Europe (3.0 million more than a year earlier).

The Eurosport International paying subscriber base was up 3.6%;
growth was driven mainly by Eastern Europe and the United Kingdom.

The Eurosport 2 channel continues to grow, and was being received in
62.5 million homes at end December 2012 (up 9.4% year-on-year).

The Eurosport HD channel is also on a rising trend, having gained
7.6 million new subscribers in twelve months.

The Eurosportnews channel is being received in 2.2 million homes
in Europe, mainly in Portugal and Russia. This channel is also well
embedded outside Europe, especially in Africa and Oceania.

The Asia/Pacific version of the Eurosport channel is continuing to expand
in its catchment area (Asia/Oceania), and had 5.8 million subscribers at
end December 2012 (up 16.8% year-on-year).

Overall, the Eurosport group achieved audience growth of 7.1%, despite
the intensifying level of competition between sports broadcasters.

The Eurosport group's internet activities are going from strength to
strength, propelling Eurosport to the top ranking among European
sport sites”). With 14 local versions around the world, the website was
attracting 3.3 million unique visitors at end December®.

In addition to the website, Eurosport offers a smartphone and tablet app
in 10 languages. This app was downloaded by 10.0 million users (up
85.2% versus 2011).

The Eurosport channels are also broadcast over the Internet, and have
an average monthly following of 105,000 customers (up 47.6% year-
on-year).

MANAGEMENT REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
2012 activity and results

OTHER ACTIVITIES

No activities were included in this segment in 2012. In 2011, this
segment comprised SPS, which generated revenue of €1.5m and a
current operating loss of €8.7m. SPS was divested in May 2011.

The TF1 group faces another year of economic uncertainty in 2013.

With the economic situation still deeply troubled, we are working on the
assumption that our full-year consolidated revenue for 2013 will contract
by 3%.

Despite the upheavals of the past five years, we have nonetheless
succeeded in radically transforming the TF1 group:

= in terms of our offering, we are no longer just a mass media player:
we now combine the effectiveness of mass media with the intimacy
of digital media;

= in terms of our business model: the TF1 channel is now at the heart of
anew ecosystem. Its audience, boosted by flagship programmes and
strong brands with massive spin-off potential, has become a source
of fresh revenues.

However, to continue our progress and build for the future, we will
be addressing five key issues in 2013: consolidating our free-to-view
offering, expanding our consumer businesses, enhancing our pay-TV
offering, improving our competitiveness, and continuing to deliver on our
corporate social responsibility agenda.

LOCKING IN A NEW FREE-TO-VIEW MODEL

Our free-to-view TV offering is unrivalled in France, thanks to 4 channels:
TF1, the undisputed leader; the fast-growing channels TMC and NT1;
and HD1, the new creative channel we launched on December 12,
2012. Our free-to-view strategy is to extend the TF1 channel's reach
across all our activities, building on our status as a multi-channel group.

One of our priorities in 2013 will be to consolidate our overall audience.

We will also focus on developing new programmes on our channels (not
only TF1, but also TMC, NT1 and HD1), enhancing the fit and exploiting
the synergies between our channels, while continuing to comply with all
of our commitments to the relevant authorities.

To provide content to our channels, we will continue with our policy of
investing in innovative formats — on our own, in partnership or via in-
house production — while retaining a rigorous negotiating stance and
making the most of our rights portfolio.

Finally, in terms of selling airtime on the TF1 and HD1 channels, in 2013
our in-house agency TF1 Publicité will seek to maintain the value of
slots and intensify digital spin-offs. At the same time, the agency will be

looking for opportunities to sell space on new media, in order to offer
advertisers a more comprehensive service, from mass media to one-
to-one media.

EXPAND OUR CONSUMER BUSINESSES

We have forged close relationships with all our publics through all
the outlets available, including social networks. TF1 interacts with
the consumer through home shopping, DVD/VoD production and
distribution, board and card games, and music production.

In this area, we will continue during 2013 to move forward with our
customer-oriented strategy, based on three main levers:

= brand exploitation, including not just the TF1 brand with its unrivalled
promotional and value-creative power, but also our broader portfolio
of strong brands;

technological opportunities, which will inevitably offer new possibilities
for enhanced  viewer/programme ___ interactivity,  ever-greater
diversification of access to content, and multi-screen experiences;

the constantly-evolving customer/viewer relationship, with advertisers
demanding ever sharper targeting. Not only are we making steady
progress in this area, but we also offer an array of media channels
with promising potential.

ENHANCING OUR PAY-TV OFFERING

Our strategy for 2013 will be to develop a competitive offering for
the French market. The partnership between TF1 and Discovery
Communications will enable us to rely on Discovery's experience in
non-fiction media channels so that we can provide French distributors
with a benchmark offering of theme channels, with our existing channels
complemented by Discovery's rights portfolio.

We will also seek during 2013 to exploit the many synergies between
Eurosport and Discovery Communications. The two groups will join
forces in distribution (including the formation of a joint venture), in local
advertising, and in business development, consistent with Eurosport's
strategy.

2012 activity and results

IMPROVING OUR COMPETITIVENESS

During 2013, we will press ahead with Phase II of our optimisation plan,
designed to adapt our business model. Focused on reducing operating
costs and introducing greater flexibility, Phase II has already generated
€15m of savings in 2012.

We will now be working to unlock a further €70m of recurring savings
by end 2014, thanks to lower overheads, better productivity and
optimisation of programming costs.

In light of the economic situation, we have decided to accelerate the
implementation of Phase II.

In 2013, TF1 channel programming costs should not exceed €900m.

3.2.3 Post balance sheet events

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Conscious of our responsibilities as a leading media group, we embed
corporate social responsibility into all of our strategic decisions.

In 2013, we will once again be at the forefront of CSR initiatives in the
media sector. We will respect diversity in our people and programmes,
and ensure that our programmes are inclusive and non-discriminatory.
We will promote solidarity, social cohesion and sustainable development,
and remain open at all times to dialogue with all our stakeholders.

Thanks to solid fundamentals, a healthy financial position giving us the
means to realise our goals, clear and ambitious strategy, we are now
better placed that ever to consolidate our position as France's leading
private-sector television group. Our watchwords for the future: anticipate
and deliver.

There are no post balance sheet events to report.

3.2.6 Principal acquisitions and divestments

NEWLY CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES, CHANGES IN
SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION AND ACQUISITIONS
OF EQUITY INTERESTS

CHANGE IN PERCENTAGE INTEREST IN THE EUROSPORT
GROUP ENTITIES AND THEME CHANNELS

As a result of the agreement with the Discovery Communications group
(see Note 1, page 109), the percentage control held by the TF1 group in
the Eurosport group entities, and in the Ushuaia TV, Stylia, Histoire and
TV Breizh pay-TV theme channels, has been 80% since December 21,
2012. The 20% share of the net assets of these entities acquired by
the Discovery Communications group, amounting to €102.6 million, is
presented in consolidated shareholders’ equity attributable to minority
interests. The share of profits for the period from December 22 to

December 31, 2012, has not been allocated to minority interests on
grounds of immateriality.

INCLUSION OF GROUPE AB IN THE SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION
AS AN ASSOCIATE BY THE EQUITY METHOD

TF1 has held a 33.5% equity interest in Groupe AB since April 2, 2007,
the other principal investor being Claude Berda.

On June 10, 2010, in connection with the acquisition by TF1 of the TMC
and NT1 channels from Groupe AB, TF1 granted Claude Berda a call
option entitling him to buy out TF1's 33.5% interest in Groupe AB for
its estimated market value of €155 million. In accordance with IAS 27,
TF1 therefore ceased to account for its equity interest in Groupe AB
as an associate by the equity method, instead recognising the equity
interest in the balance sheet as a non-current financial asset at a value

of €155 million. TF1 elected to recognise subsequent changes in the
fair value of the equity interest in profit or loss, so that they would offset
subsequent changes in the fair value of the option (recognised in financial
income or expense, and in financial liabilities in the balance sheet).

The equity interest and the associated call option were valued on the
basis of the consolidated net assets of Groupe AB as remeasured at fair
value in 2010, plus the profits of Groupe AB recognised since that date
(including depreciation and amortisation charged against remeasured
assets) and a multiple-based approach applicable to Groupe AB.

Because no material change in the fair value of the equity interest
occurred during the life of the option, both the equity interest and the
option were maintained at their initial values, i.e. €155 million and zero
respectively.

As of the expiry date of the option (June 10, 2012), TF1’s equity interest
in Groupe AB was valued at €160.9 million. The fair value of the equity
interest was adjusted accordingly, and a symmetrical financial liability
(of €5.9 million) representing the fair value of the option was also
recognised. Because the option was not exercised, the financial liability
was extinguished, generating a gain (recognised in “Other financial
income’) in the financial statements for the six months ended June 30,
2012.

REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2012 FW]

The option having expired, the TF1 group has regained the significant
influence that it used to exercise over Groupe AB. Consequently, this
equity interest is now once again accounted for as an associate by the
equity method, with effect from June 11, 2012.

DIRECT OPTIC PARTICIPATIONS

In accordance with the terms of the agreements signed on March
1, 2011, Téléshopping converted into share capital a €2.5 million
current account balance owed to it by Direct Optic Participations.
This transaction took place on December 28, 2012, and increased
Téléshopping’s equity interest in Direct Optic from 25.4% to 47.8%. This
increased percentage has no impact on the role or power of TF1 vis-a-
vis Direct Optic Participations.

The investment continues to be accounted for as an associate by the
equity method in the consolidated financial statements.
