Allianz Group structure

Allianz sE and its subsidiaries (the Allianz Group) offer property-
casualty insurance, life/health insurance and asset management
products and services in over 70 countries, with the largest of our
operations located in Europe. The Allianz Group insures 86.3 million
customers. Allianz SE, the parent company of the Allianz Group, has
its headquarters in Munich, Germany.

The Allianz Group structure reflects both our business segments
and geographical regions. Business activities are organized by product
and type of service, based on how these are strategically managed:
insurance activities, asset management activities, and corporate and
other activities. Due to differences in the nature of products, risks,
and capital allocation, insurance activities are further divided into
property-casualty and life/health categories. In accordance with the
responsibilities of the Board of Management, each of the insurance
categories is grouped into regional reportable segments. Corporate
and other activities are divided into three different reportable seg-
ments in order to differentiate between the respective products, risks,
and capital allocation. In 2016, the Allianz Group had 16 reportable
segments.

Our steering

BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
Allianz sz has a divisional Board structure based on functional and
business responsibilities. Business-related divisions reflect our busi-
ness segments Property-Casualty, Life/Health, Asset Management,
and Corporate and Other, and in 2016 were overseen by five Board
members. The remaining four divisions (i.e. Chairman of the Board
of Management, Finance, Investments, and Operations) focus on
Group functions, along with business-related responsibilities.

For further information on Board of Management members and
their responsibilities, please refer to Mandates of the Members of the
Board of Management starting on (>) page 12.

TARGET SETTING AND MONITORING

The Allianz Group steers its operating entities and business seg-
ments via an integrated management and control process. It begins
with the definition of a business-specific strategy and goals, which
are discussed and agreed upon between the Holding and operating
entities. Based on this strategy, our operating entities prepare three-
year plans which are then aggregated to form the financial plans for
the business divisions and for the Allianz Group as a whole. This plan
also forms the basis for our capital management. The Supervisory
Board approves the plan and sets corresponding targets for the Board
of Management. The performance-based remuneration of the Board
of Managementis linked to short-term, mid-term, and long-term tar-
gets to ensure effectiveness and emphasize sustainability. For further
details about our remuneration structure, including target setting
and performance assessment, please refer to the Remuneration
Report starting on () page 24.

We continuously monitor our business performance against
these targets through monthly reviews — which cover key operational
and financial metrics — to ensure we can move quickly and take
appropriate measures in the event of negative developments. The
Allianz Group uses operating profit and net income as key financial
performance indicators across all its business segments. Other indi-
cators include segment-specific figures, such as the combined ratio
for Property-Casualty, return on equity’ for Life/Health, and the cost-
income ratio for Asset Management. To steer and control new busi-
ness in our business segments Property-Casualty and Life/Health, we
use Return on Risk Capital (RoRC). For a comprehensive view of our
business segment performance, please refer to the chapters from
© page 39 onwards.

Besides performance steering, we also have a risk steering process
in place, which is described in the Risk and Opportunity Report starting
on (9) page 62.

Non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs) are mainly used
for the sustainability assessment that we conduct when determining
mid-term bonus levels. In line with our Renewal Agenda, KPIs mainly
represent three key levers: True Customer Centricity, Digital by Default,
and Inclusive Meritocracy. Examples include the Allianz Engagement
Survey and Net Promoter Score (NPs?) results, diversity development,
and the share of digital retail products/digital client communication.

1 — Excluding unrealized gains/losses on bonds net of shadow accounting.

2—NPS is a measurement of customers’ willingness to recommend Allianz. Top-down NPs is measured
regularly according to global cross-industry standards and allows benchmarking against competitors in
the respective markets.

Our Corporate Responsibility approach

As an international financial services company, we find it vital to
ensure that our growth is both sustainable and profitable. We want
to create long-term value by strategically embedding sustainability
in our core business and by enabling our customers to address
tomorrow’s challenges. This requires us to continually adapt our
business strategy in response to our stakeholders’ and working part-
ners’ needs, to the most pressing sustainability issues, and to the
activities of national and international sustainability bodies and ini-
tiatives, in order to deliver on global commitments such as the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Our Corporate Responsibility Strategy contributes to our Renewal
Agenda and focuses on our most material sustainability issues:

Low-carbon economy: supporting renewable energy and decarbon-
ization through our investments; providing green insurance solutions;
reducing our environmental footprint.

Social inclusion: supporting the social inclusion of children and youth
through our Future Generations program; developing solutions for
customers in emerging markets; promoting diversity and wellbeing
among our employees.

Business integrity: integrating environmental, social and governance
(ESG) issues across our investment and insurance businesses; building
trust through transparency, responsible sales, and data privacy.

In 2016, we surveyed over 6,000 stakeholders to identify our most
material issues as well as the relative importance of the solutions we
provide. The results show that the most important megatrends and
risks Allianz faces across those target groups and countries surveyed
are climate change & environment, personal customer safety, digita-
lization, societal change, and fiscal crisis. We will continue to integrate
our stakeholders’ views in both our sustainability strategy and our
reporting approach.

For reporting purposes, we organize our approach around
Allianz’s five key roles as sustainable insurer, responsible investor,
trusted company, attractive employer, and committed corporate
citizen.

Please refer to our 2016 Group Sustainability Report (to be
published on 5 April 2017) for full details of our corporate responsi-
bility strategy, approach and performance: (>) www.allianz.com/

Business Environment

Economic environment 2016!

In 2016 the global economy proved to be remarkably resilient in the
face of heightened political and economic uncertainty. Neither con-
cerns about a slowdown of the Chinese economy, which prompted
some turmoil on the equity markets in early 2016, nor major political
surprises — including the outcome of the Brexit vote in June and the
USS. presidential elections in November— managed to derail the global
economy from its moderate growth path. Compared with 2015, eco-
nomic growth in the industrialized countries decelerated in 2016.
Real gross domestic product rose by 1.6% (2015: 2.1%). In the United
States, the loss in economic momentum in 2016, compared to the
average pace in the current cycle, primarily reflects weakness in busi-
ness investment. By contrast, private consumption continued to grow
robustly. In the Eurozone, the economic recovery continued, albeit at
a slightly slower pace than in 2015. Real gross domestic product
expanded by 1.7% (2015: 1.9%). Private consumption was supported
by both low inflation and a gradual labor market improvement. With
an increase of 1.9%, the German economy recorded a slightly higher
growth rate than the Eurozone as a whole.

In the emerging markets, growth deceleration finally came to an
end in the course of 2016. Commodity-exporting emerging markets
benefited from the uptick in commodity prices. Most Eastern Euro-
pean E.U. member states continued to benefit from the ongoing recov-
ery in the Eurozone. Russia saw its economy stabilizing, following a
severe recession in 2015. Thanks primarily to fiscal stimulus, China’s
growth decelerated only marginally from 6.9% in 2015 to 6.7% in 2016.
As a whole, the emerging-market group expanded by a rather disap-
pointing 3.6%—the same rate as in 2015 and well below the long-term
average of roughly 5.5% per year. Overall, the world economy grew by
an estimated 2.4%, somewhat slower than in 2015, when global output
rose by 2.7%. Global merchandise trade registered its lowest growth
rate since the Great Recession in 2009: less than 1%. The pace of global-
ization in merchandise trade has evidently abated considerably.

Financial market developments in 2016 continued to be charac-
terized by very low interest rates, a strong U.S. Dollar, and relatively low
stock-market volatility — the latter despite high political uncertainty.
In the United States, the Federal Reserve raised the target federal
funds rate to 0.50%—0.75% in December; this was its second move
since ending the zero-interest policy in late 2015. By contrast, the
European Central Bank continued to ease its monetary policy stance
with a bundle of measures, including the extension of the bond pur-
chasing program at least until the end of 2017. Yields on 10-year Ger-
man government bonds reached 0.2% at year-end 2016, a decrease of
40 basis points compared to the previous year. Major stock-market
indices, following a negative start, registered gains in the course of
2016. The Euro lost further ground against the u.s. Dollar, closing the
year at 1.05 U.S. Dollar to Euro — almost 4% below the level seen at the
beginning of 2016. The diverging monetary policies of the Federal
Reserve and the European Central Bank were a key factor behind this
downward correction. In terms of portfolio flows, emerging markets

hada difficult year: net non-resident capital inflows to bond and equity
markets fell below Usb 28 BN — the lowest annual inflow since 2008 -,
which was mainly due to rising U.S. yields.

Business environment 2016
for the insurance industry

2016 was an eventful year for the insurance industry, with most of
these events having more downsides than upsides. The macroeco-
nomic environment presented significant headwinds: the recovery of
the world economy continued, but with reduced momentum. 2016
also marked the end of a three-year streak of relatively low losses
from natural catastrophes: Not only did the number of events
increase further — among them an unusually high number of flood
events — but losses jumped to levels more than 50 percent higher than
the previous year’s. On the regulatory front, the industry as a whole
managed to adjust smoothly to the new Solvency il regime which had
come into force as of 2016. Regulatory pressure remained high, how-
ever, in particular with regard to reserve requirements, stress testing,
or reporting.

And these are only the macroeconomic challenges. Even more
daunting were events in the microeconomy, first and foremost the
digital revolution. Not only will digitization, big data, and artificial
intelligence fundamentally transform the industry — in addition,
highly connected technologies have begun to cause a radical shift in
the nature of risks faced by society. As a result, the industry is con-
fronted with new demands: It has to find new solutions that allow
people to take new risks — for example in the sharing economy —and
also promote the use of new technologies. So, in the short term, the
need to innovate and adjust its current business model will put addi-
tional pressure on the industry. In the longer run, however, the digital
economy should offer plenty of opportunities to expand the business,
as is already exemplified by the rapid rise in cyber-insurance (albeit
from a very low base). Against this backdrop of macro- and micro-
challenges, the industry proved remarkably resilient in 2016. Premium
income was more or less stable; profitability was under pressure but
dropped just a notch or two.

In the property-casuallty sector, premium growth decelerated slightly
in advanced markets, reflecting some weaknesses in Japan and North
America. Western Europe, on the other hand, kept more or less pace
thanks to the ongoing economic recovery, but overall the market
remained rather weak. As in the past, premiums grew much faster in
the emerging markets, driven by a robust growth in Asia. The other
two major emerging regions fared quite differently: Whereas the
slowdown in Latin America continued in 2016, Eastern Europe showed
clear signs of a recovery. Pricing continued to be a concern in nearly all
markets, particularly in the commercial insurance segment. Premi-
ums, overall and at a global level, rose by an estimated 4% in 2016 (in
nominal terms and adjusted for foreign currency translation effects).

39


--- Page 5 ---

C — Group Management Report

Underwriting profitability suffered from more frequent and
more costly natural catastrophes, such as the Kumamoto Earthquake
in Japan, severe storms and floods in Germany and France, and Hur-
ricane Matthew in the United States. Insurers’ investment income
remained weak as investment returns were challenged by very low
interest rates. As a result, overall profitability is likely to have slipped
marginally in 2016.

In the life sector, premium growth was very strong in emerging mar-
kets or, more precisely, in emerging Asian markets: Life premiums
rose by more than 20 percent there, mainly due to the extraordinary
growth experienced in the Chinese market. The other two emerging
regions show a totally different picture: Premium growth in Latin
America flattened, reflecting the economic troubles of its biggest
market, Brazil; Eastern Europe remained in the doldrums, not least
due to changes in the tax regime for life products in some key markets.
For advanced markets, too, 2016 proved to be a rather difficult year.
Premium growth slowed - or even turned negative — in many markets
as the ongoing low-yield environment continued to pose problems
for the savings-type core insurance business. In total, according to
our own estimates, global premiums grew by almost 5% in 2016 (in
nominal terms and adjusted for foreign currency translation effects).

The current low-yield environment also presented the greatest
challenge in the life sector, impairing the profitability of in-force
business. Insurers responded by continuing to shift the product mix
towards less capital-intensive products, for example by offering lower
or more flexible guarantees. At the same time, the focus moved from
traditional savings to protection business. To boost investment
income, insurers increasingly turned to non-traditional investments
such as infrastructure. These actions notwithstanding, overall profit-
ability is likely to have drifted downward slightly.

40

Business environment 2016
for the asset management industry

This was a disruptive year for the asset management industry. Global
equity markets started 2016 with a sharp drop, then made a broad
recovery in the following months. Emerging-market and U.s. equities
finished the year particularly strong; European indices lagged a bit
and exhibited higher volatility, particularly after the Brexit vote, but
still finished the year in positive territory.

Continued accommodative monetary policy across major econ-
omies led to falling yields and rising bond prices through most of the
year. This resulted in very strong returns for bond indices in both
Europe and the United States — until the results of the u.s. election
sent yields soaring, as prospects of a more supportive fiscal policy
and a tightening labor market raised inflation expectations. There
was also some spill-over into the Eurozone, causing yields to rise late
in the year, albeit to a lesser extent than in the United States. Bond
indices in both the United States and Europe still finished the year
with positive returns.

Currencies proved highly volatile during the year, with the British
Pound weakening significantly after the Brexit vote. The u.s. Dollar
strengthened markedly after the U.s. election and a subsequent spike
in yields.

The shift in investor preference towards passively managed
funds continued throughout 2016 and was especially pronounced in
the United States, where active equity mutual funds were particu-
larly hard-hit. Actively managed taxable bond mutual funds in the
United States finished the year with positive flows, but were also
notably outstripped by their passive counterparts. Investors showed
a general preference for bonds over actively managed equities most
of the year, though this trend reversed towards year-end as yields rose
and U.S. equity markets rallied following the election. European
investors directed flows predominately into active fixed income
funds and to a lesser extent into passive equity and fixed income
products.

Earnings summary

MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF 2016 RESULTS

Our total revenues decreased by 2.2% this past business year, a drop
of 0.8% on an internal basis compared to 2015. Much of this decrease
was attributable to our Life/Health business segment, where we con-
tinued our targeted shift towards preferred lines of business. Both
lower other net fee and commission income, mainly due to lower
third-party assets under management-driven margins, and a decrease
in performance fees in our Asset Management business segment
further contributed to the decline. Our Property-Casualty business
segment enjoyed internal premium growth, mainly arising from
Turkey, Germany and Allianz Worldwide Partners.

Our operating investment result increased by €692 MN to
€ 25,125 MN, mainly due to gains from the net of foreign currency
translation effects and financial derivatives, with the latter being
used to protect against equity and foreign currency fluctuations as
well as to manage duration and other exposures related to interest
rates. This was partly offset by lower interest and similar income,
driven by the low interest rates.

Annual Report 2016 — Allianz Group

Our operating profit was near the upper end of our 2016 target
range and increased by 0.9% compared to 2015. Our Life/Health busi-
ness segment recorded an increase in operating profit, mainly due to
a higher investment margin in the United States as well as favorable
DAC unlocking effects in France. The operating result in our Corporate
and Other business segment also improved, primarily as a result of
lower pension costs. The operating profit generated by our Property-
Casualty business segment declined, reflecting the impact of lower
interest yields on our investment result. In addition, 2015 included a
€0.1 BN net gain (net of related expenses and restructuring charges)
from the sale of the Fireman’s Fund personal insurance business. The
business segment’s underwriting result, however, improved. In our
Asset Management business segment, a reduction in operating
expenses could only partially compensate for lower operating reve-
nues, resulting in a decline in operating profit.

Our non-operating result was stable at a loss of € 541 MN, with a
number of offsetting effects. On the one hand we had significant
impairments (net), partly due to the impairment losses on our South
Korean Life/Health business as well as on the Oldenburgische Landes-
bank Ac? upon classification as held for sale at the beginning of the
second quarter of 2016 and end of 2016, respectively. In addition, the
negative result that the South Korean Life/Health business generated
until its disposal in the fourth quarter of 2016 was considered as non-
operating, as it is no longer part of the ongoing core operations of the
Allianz Group®. On the other hand, non-operating realized gains (net)
increased following portfolio rebalancing. We also reported higher
non-operating income from financial assets and liabilities carried at
fair value through income (net), mainly due to favorable impacts
from hedging-related activities.

Income taxes fell by € 167 MN to € 3,042 MN, mainly driven by
higher tax-exempted income. The effective tax rate decreased to 29.6%
(2015: 31.5%).

The increase in our net income was driven by the higher operating
profit and lower effective tax rate.

Our shareholders’ equity rose by € 4.2 BN to € 67.3 BN, compared
to31 December 2015. Over the same period our Solvency II capitaliza-
tion ratio strengthened from 200% to 218%.

tions, Life/Health insurance operations, Asset Management, and Cor-

Gross premiums written>

On a nominal basis, gross premiums written were almost stable com-
pared to 2015.

Unfavorable foreign currency translation effects amounted to
€ 1,138 MN, largely due to the depreciation of the British Pound, the
Argentine Peso, and the Turkish Lira against the Euro.*

Consolidation/deconsolidation effects were negative, amount-
ing to €519 MN. This was largely attributable to the sale of the Fire-
man’s Fund personal insurance business to ACE limited in 2015.

On an internal basis, our growth was strong at 3.1% driven by a
positive volume effect of 2.0% and a positive price effect of 1.1%.

The following operations contributed positively to internal growth:

Turkey: Gross premiums reached € 1,695 MN. The internal growth
of 43.0% was driven by positive volume and price contributions in our
motor third-party liability insurance business.

Germany: We recorded gross premiums of € 9,902 MN, an
increase of 2.8% on an internal basis. This was mainly due to favorable
price effects in our motor insurance business, and supported by
favorable volume effects in our non-motor commercial insurance
business.

Allianz Worldwide Partners: Gross premiums increased to
€ 4,185 MN. The internal growth of 4.7% was mainly driven by our U.S.
travel business and our assistance business in France.

AGCS: Gross premiums stood at € 7,592 MN. The internal growth
of 0.5% was largely generated by positive volume effects at Allianz Risk
Transfer, much of which was offset by negative price impacts across
both our corporate and specialty lines of business.

our motor insurance business.

United Kingdom: Gross premiums amounted to € 2,623 MN, a
decline of 3.6% on an internal basis. Positive price developments in
our retail motor and pet insurance businesses were more than offset
by negative volume effects, mostly in our retail motor insurance busi-
ness.

Credit Insurance: We recorded gross premiums of € 2,200 MN, a
decline of 0.5% on an internal basis. This decrease resulted from
negative price and volume effects mainly in Germany and Asia.

Our accident year loss ratio stood at 70.1% — a 0.2 percentage point
improvement compared to the previous year. It was driven bya slight
decrease in losses from natural catastrophes from €738 MN to
€ 689 MN, representing a reduced combined ratio impact from 1.6 per-
centage points in 2015 to 1.5 percentage points in 2016.

C — Group Management Report

Excluding losses from natural catastrophes, our accident year
loss ratio improved to 68.6%. This was predominantly due to a com-
bination of lower losses from weather-related events and profitabil-
ity programs we conducted across the Allianz Group.

The following operations contributed positively to the development
of our accident year loss ratio:

United Kingdom: 0.2 percentage points. The accident year loss
ratio benefited from a very low impact of natural catastrophes in 2016.

AGCS: 0.1 percentage points. The improvement stemmed from
lower losses in the property and marine lines of business, while lower
large losses were offset by higher natural catastrophes compared to
2015.

Spain: 0.1 percentage points. This was driven by portfolio clean-
ing actions in loss making lines of business and price increases
across the portfolio.

The following operation contributed negatively to the development
of our accident year loss ratio:

France: 0.2 percentage points. The deterioration was driven by a
combination of higher large losses as well as higher losses from natu-
ral catastrophes compared to the previous year.

The higher run-off result led to an increased run-off ratio amounting
to 4.5% (2015: 4.1%), driven by reserve releases across most of the port-
folio. In particular France and Australia delivered more run-off com-
pared to the prior year, due to a beneficial development in their long
tail business.

The increase in our expense ratio was driven, in equal parts, by a
higher acquisition ratio and a higher administrative expense ratio.

At the beginning of the second quarter of 2016, all requirements were
fulfilled to present our South Korean business — until its disposal in
the fourth quarter of 2016 — as held for sale. Consequently, the nega-
tive result of € 268 MN that the South Korean business generated was
considered as non-operating, as the entity is no longer part of our
ongoing core operations. In order to better reflect the true underlying
drivers of our operating profit, we report it by profit sources and by
lines of business for both 2015 and 2016 excluding South Korea, and
specify the South Korean operating loss as a separate item.

Similarly, the figures for present value of new business premi-
ums are shown without effects from the South Korean business.

To ensure consistency with the group income statement, how-
ever, statutory premiums are presented including premiums collected
from our South Korean business.

Statutory premiums®

On a nominal basis, statutory premiums went down by 3.4%. This
includes unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of € 347 MN
and positive (de-)consolidation effects of € 138 MN.

Onan internal basis°, statutory premiums dropped by € 2,058 MN
—or 3.1%— to € 64,947 MN, mainly due to lower unit-linked single pre-
miums in Italy and Taiwan as well as declining traditional business
both in Germany and Italy. The increase in our fixed-indexed and
non-traditional variable annuity sales in the United States and the
premium growth in capital-efficient products in Germany partly
compensated for this development. In line with our changed product
strategy, premiums continued to shift towards capital-efficient prod-
ucts.

Annual Report 2016 — Allianz Group

Statutory premiums in the German life business amounted to
€ 18,876 MN, a 6.4% increase on an internal basis. This resulted main-
ly from a growth in our business with capital-efficient products. It
more than offset the decline in sales of traditional life products,
which include long-term interest rate guarantees. Statutory premi-
ums in the German health business increased to € 3,289 MN, repre-
senting an internal growth of 1.0%, driven by the acquisition of new
customers in the supplementary health care coverage.

In the United States, statutory premiums increased to € 11,856 MN,
or by 13.0% on an internal basis. This was largely driven by higher
fixed-indexed and non-traditional variable annuity sales, mainly as
a result of our marketing activities in the first half of 2016.

In Italy we recorded statutory premiums of € 9,529 MN. The
decrease of 20.2% on an internal basis was largely attributable to
lower unit-linked single premium sales — as a result of higher finan-
cial market volatility — and a decrease in traditional life business.

In France, statutory premiums fell to € 7,956 MN, a slight decrease
of 1.2% on an internal basis, largely due to a decline in our individual
life business.

In the Asia-Pacific region, statutory premiums stood at € 5,383 MN,
a 19.2% drop on an internal basis, its main cause being a decrease in
unit-linked sales in Taiwan. Statutory premiums in South Korea
decreased to € 1,307 MN, or by 21.4% on an internal basis.

The operating profit rise in our guaranteed savings & annuities line of
business was mainly due to positive hedging-related impacts in our
traditional variable annuity business in the United States as well as
favorable DAC unlocking effects in France. Operating profit in the pro-
tection & health line of business dropped, largely driven by a lower
investment margin in the German health business and one-off effects
in the United States. Our operating profit in the unit-linked without
guarantee line of business went down, primarily due to a reduction

a higher spread margin in the United States.

Return on equity

As of 2016 onwards, margin on reserves has been replaced by return
on equity to better reflect the way we steer our Life/Health insurance
operations.

Our return on equity decreased by 0.5 percentage points to 10.3%,

mainly resulting from the unfavorable net income development of
the South Korean business.

Net income

Aslight decrease in our net income was largely driven by the negative
net impact of our business in South Korea in 2016 as well as lower real-
izations compared to a high base in 2015, mainly in Italy.

Net outflows? of total assets under management (AuM) amounted to
€ 28 BN in 2016. Thereof, € 20 BN were attributable to third-party AuM
net outflows (2015: € 107 BN). A major share of this year’s outflows
were PIMCO’s third-party AuM net outflows — mainly in the United
States and the United Kingdom -, which could only partly be offset by
third-party AuM net inflows that primarily occurred in Japan. PIMCO’s
third-party AuM net outflows occurred in the first half of 2016, and
turned into net inflows in the second half. AllianzGi recorded minor
third-party AuM net outflows, mostly in the United States.

3._Net flows represent the sum of new client assets, additional contributions from existing clients including
dividend reinvestment withdrawals f assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions
to investors. Reinvested dividends amounted to € 10 aN.

48

Favorable effects from Market and Other* amounted to € 76 BN,
which made them the biggest driver of the upswing in total AuM.
Again, much of this development was due to PIMco, where the effects
amounted to € 64 BN, and mainly concerned fixed income assets.

An upswing of total AuM of € 31 BN from consolidation, decon-
solidation and other adjustments was almost entirely driven by the
acquisition of Rogge Global Partners (Rogge) by Allianzci.

Favorable effects from foreign currency translation caused an
increase of total AuM of € 29 BN. This was mainly due to the apprecia-
tion of the U.s. Dollar against the Euro.

In the following section we focus on the development of third-party
assets under management.

As of 31 December 2016, the share of third-party AuM by business
unit was 76.1% (31 December 2015: 77.3%) attributable to PIMCO and
23.9% (31 December 2015: 22.7%) attributable to Allianzcl.

The share of fixed income assets rose from 74.0% at the beginning
of the year to 75.5%, mainly due to positive market effects and con-
solidation effects due to the Rogge acquisition. The share of equities
declined from 11.8% to 10.3%, primarily driven by third-party AuM net
outflows which were only partly offset by positive effects from equity
markets. The shares of multi-assets and other were roughly stable at
10.0% and 4.2% (31 December 2015: 10.5% and 3.7%, respectively).

The shares in third-party assets of both mutual funds and sepa-
rate accounts? were quite steady compared to the end of 2015, with
mutual funds at 57.8% (31 December 2015: 58.3%) and separate
accounts at 42.2% (31 December 2015: 41.7%).

As for the regional allocation of third-party AuM®, shares did not
shift remarkably: America 55.3%, Europe 32.8% and the Asia-Pacific
region 11.9% (31 December 2015: 56.0%, 32.7% and 11.3%). All three
regions contributed to the increase in third-party AuM. However, pri-
marily due to positive effects in Japan as well as third-party AuM net
outflows in the United States and the United Kingdom, the regional
allocation shifted slightly in favor of the Asia-Pacific region.

4_—Market and Other represents current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held

Mutual funds are investment vehicles (in the United States, investment companies subject to the u.s.
code; in Germany, vehicles subject to the "Standard-Anlagerichtlinien des Fonds" Invest mentgesetz)
‘where the money of several individual investors is pooled into one account to be managed by the asset
manager, e.g. open-end funds, closed-end funds. Separate accounts are investment vehicles where
the money ofa single investoris directly managed by the asset manager ina separate dedicated account
(eg. public or private institutions, high net worth individuals, and corporates).

Hi Underperforming third-party assets under management

— Three-year rolling investment performance reflects the mandate-based and volume-weighted three-
year investment success of all third-party assets that are managed by Allianz Asset Managements
portfolio- management units. Fr separate accounts and mutual funds, the investment success (valued
on the basis ofthe closing prices) is compared with the investment success prior to cost deduction of
the respective benchmark, based on various metrics. For some mutual funds, the investment success,
reduced by fees, is compared with the investment success of the median of the respective Morningstar
ppeer group (a position inthe frst and second quartile is equivalent to outperformance).

The overall three-year rolling investment performance of our Asset
Management business improved significantly, with 83% of third-
party assets outperforming their respective benchmarks (31 Decem-
ber 2015: 69%). The increase was driven by PIMco’s rolling investment
performance, which strengthened towards the end of the year.

Operating revenues

Our operating revenues decreased by 7.1%, which corresponds to a
drop of 7.5% on an internal basis!.

We recorded lower performance fees, mainly due to decreased
carried interest from a large private fund at PIMCo.

Other net fee and commission income went down primarily
because of lower third-party AuM-driven margins at both PIMco and
Allianzct. The main cause for this were outflows from higher-margin
assets at PIMCO. To a lesser extent, lower average third-party AuM con-
tributed to the decrease in other net fee and commission income.

effects

Annual Report 2016 — Allianz Group

C — Group Management Report

Operating profit

Operating profit declined by 4.4% on an internal basis'. While operat-
ing revenues declined, the corresponding impact on operating profit
was mitigated by reduced operating expenses.

Administrative expenses could be lowered significantly, mainly
due to decreased personnel expenses. The latter decreased primarily
because of a 15.0% drop in variable compensation, which strongly
reflected the lower expenses associated with the Special Performance
Award (SPA). The sPA was introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014 at
PIMCO to secure performance and retain talent. The decrease in per-
sonnel expenses was supported by lower average full time equivalents.
In addition, lower non-personnel expenses also contributed to the
decrease in overall administrative expenses.

Other operating expenses dropped due to lower restructuring
charges.

Our cost-income ratio declined slightly, as the relative decrease
in operating expenses outpaced the relative decrease in operating
revenues. The spa effect contributed 0.7 percentage points to the cost-
income ratio — net of the impact on variable compensation.

Earnings summary

Our operating result improved in 2016 due to the positive develop-
mentin Holding & Treasury which by far overcompensated the decline
in Banking.

Our net loss remained at the previous year’s level, as various
effects offset one another. We recorded a higher non-operating invest-
ment result as well as lower income taxes, offset by the absence of
positive effects from an adapted cost allocation scheme for the pen-
sion provisions.

In Holding & Treasury, our operating result increased. This was
mainly driven by lower administrative expenses, caused by a decline
in pension costs. Also, our income from financial assets and liabilities
carried at fair value increased due to the valuation of seed money
funds.

Banking’s operating result decreased. The year was burdened by
a further tightening of interest rate spreads, which led to lower net
interest results in almost all our banking units. A reduction in our
loan loss provisions could not fully offset this development.

The operating result generated by Alternative Investments
remained stable.

Overview: 2016 results versus previous year’s outlook!

2016 RESULTS VERSUS PREVIOUS YEAR OUTLOOK FOR 2016

OUTLOOK 2016 — AS PER ANNUAL REPORT 2015

RESULTS 2016

ALLIANZ GROUP

Operating profit of € 10.5 BN, plus or minus € 0.5 BN.

Operating profit of € 10.8 BN.

Protection of shareholders’ investments, while
continuing to provide attractive returns and dividends.

Return on equity (RoE)' amounted to 12.0% (2015: 12.5%). Proposed dividend at € 7.60
(2015: € 7.30) per share. Stable payout ratio of 50%.

Selective profitable growth.

Property-Casualty with continued sound risk selection and strong internal growth, Life/Health
with growing asset base and solid new business margins, but Asset Management with net outflows.

PROPERTY-CASUALTY

Growth in gross premiums written by
approximately 2.0%.

Gross premiums slightly declined by 0.1 %, hence almost remained stable. A strong internal
growth of 3.1% was offset by negative foreign currency translation effects as well as by
livestitures such as the sale of Fireman's Fund personal insurance business.

Operating profit in the range of € 5.2 BN to € 5.8 BN.

Operating profit of € 5.4 BN is slightly below the mid-point of our target range. A low impact of
natural catastrophes was partially compensated by large losses. Although Argentina and Brazil
improved during 2016, the delay of their turnaround impacted the underwriting result.

Progress towards our combined ratio ambition
of 94% or better by 2018.

Combined ratio was strong at 94.3 % and on track towards our ambition for 2018.

Pressure on operating investment income (net) to
continue due to reinvestments in a consistently low
interest rate environment.

As expected, operating investment income (net) declined across our subsidiaries due to the
low interest rate environment.

LIFE/HEALTH

Prioritizing profitability over growth and continuing to
shift new business mix towards unit-linked, capital-
efficient and protection products. Addressing customer
needs in the prolonged low yield environment. Revenues
are expected to be in the range of € 62.0 BN to € 68.0 BN.

Revenues of € 64.6 BN at the mid-point of outlook. Strong growth from capital-efficient products
in Germany and the United States was more than offset by lower unit-linked sales in Italy and
Taiwan.

Operating profit between € 3.3 BN and € 3.9 BN.

Operating profit of € 4.1 BN above target range, driven by favorable investment margin
supported by higher level of net harvesting from further portfolio de-risking actions.

RoE! between 9.0% and 11.0%.

RoE! at 10.3% above mid-point of target range.

Pressure on investment income due to low interest rates
and continued capital market uncertainty.

Operating investment result reached € 21.3 BN, as lower interest and similar income was
‘compensated by higher realized gains.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

Slight increase in total assets under management (AuM)
due to positive market return, supported by a return to
positive net flows at pimco and continued solid net
inflows at Allianzcl.

‘Total AuM grew by € 108 BN to € 1,871 BN as of 31 December 2016. The increase was driven by
positive market returns and foreign currency translation effects. The consolidation of Rogge
Global Partners in the second quarter of 2016 added € 32 BN of third-party AuM. In the course of
2016, our Asset Management business segment saw third-party AuM net outflows of € 20 BN
coming from both entities. However, as expected, pimco third-party net flows turned positive
for the last two quarters of 2016.

Operating profit in the range of € 1.9 BN to € 2.5 BN.

Operating profit amounted to € 2.2 BN and meets the mid-point of the target range.

Cost-income ratio of well below 65%.

With a cost-income ratio of 63.4% our Asset Management business segment came in well
below 65%.

Economic outlook?

upward movementin oil prices and rising inflation will weigh on pri-
vate consumption, household spending will be supported by rising

Following a slight acceleration in the final quarter of 2016, the world
economy currently finds itself in fairly good shape and has made a
positive start into the year 2017. In the industrialized countries,
growth prospects are quite favorable overall. In the United States,
despite the fact that there is still not much clarity about the specifics
of economic policy under the new U.S. administration, a change in the
policy mix is on the horizon: Monetary policy will provide somewhat
less stimulus for the economic development, whereas fiscal policy
will do more as the new U.S. administration is expected to deliver on
the promise to cut taxes and launch investment initiatives. In the
course of 2017, these measures are expected to buoy economic
growth, despite some dampening effects such as higher inflation. All
in all, the u.s. economy is likely to expand by 2.2% this year. In the
Eurozone, the economic recovery is likely to continue. We expect real
gross domestic product to increase by 1.8% (2016: 1.7%). While the

Annual Report 2016 — Allianz Group

employment. The group of emerging market economies is set for a
moderate acceleration of growth, mainly driven by a gradual stabiliza-
tion in the group's heavyweights, Russia and Brazil, and by a recovery
in commodity-exporting countries. Overall, global output is likely to
expand by about 2.8% in 2017, compared with 2.4% in 2016. Industrial-
ized countries are expected to register gross domestic product
growth of 1.9%, while in emerging markets growth could increase to
4.1% from the 3.6% seen in 2016.

The uncertain global economic and political environment (e.g.
rise of populism, high emerging market indebtedness, risk of E.U. dis-
integration) is likely to result in higher financial-market volatility this
year. As far as monetary policy is concerned, assuming that the labor
market remains tight and inflation rates continue to move up, the
Federal Reserve is likely to continue to hike interest rates this year. By
contrast, we do not see any major change in the European Central
Bank’s expansionary monetary policy stance.

Modestly rising yields on 10-year U.S. government bonds and
higher inflation rates in the Eurozone will exert some upward pressure
on European benchmark bond yields in 2017. However, with short-
term rates at zero, there are limited prospects of markedly higher
yields on longer-term bonds. For 10-year German government bonds,

51


--- Page 17 ---

C — Group Management Report

we predict yields to climb modestly towards 1% in the course of 2017;
for 10-year U.S. government bonds, yields may end the year in a range
between 2.5% and 3%. While the expected Federal Reserve rate hikes
will weigh on the Euro, a number of other factors will support it;
above all, the expected rise in the U.s. current-account deficit as well
as the speculation — which is likely to increase towards year-end —
about the timing and manner of the European Central Bank’s exit
from its bond purchasing program. We expect the Dollar-to-Euro
exchange rate to close the year at about 1.10 (2016: 1.05).

Insurance industry outlook

In 2017, things are likely to start moving in the right direction for the
insurance industry: The global economy is set to shift up a gear, infla-
tion will return — which will set the scene for monetary normalization
—and last but not least, interest rates are expected to rise. That said,
the overall momentum will probably be too weak to finally escape the
low-growth, low-yield environment; so, for the time being, we expect
premium growth to remain modest and investment income to
remain under pressure. Moreover, political risks could easily derail
the economy and knock markets from their path to normalization.

While the macroeconomic environment, despite all the uncer-
tainties, offers some glimpses of hope, the challenges on the micro-
economic front remain formidable: As technological progress and
the digitization of our life gather speed, established business models
get under enormous pressure. The industry has to adapt quickly to
defend its franchise against new competitors. In combination with
the new regulatory regime (Solvency 11), which brings more clarity on
capital positions, this restructuring process could act as a possible
catalyst for more industry consolidation.

To sum up: In 2017, the industry's top line will continue to grow
modestly — though some lines of business such as trade-dependent
marine and rate-sensitive savings might struggle — while the bottom
line remains under pressure from weak investment income and the
need to build new, digital business models.

In the property-casualty sector, growth in advanced markets
should remain rather stable: The ongoing recovery supports demand,
but pricing is still a concern. For advanced markets, political insta-
bility could prove to be the biggest challenge in 2017, as growing pro-
tectionism and the looming Brexit drive structural changes in the
industry. The outlook for emerging markets is much brighter: Asia is
expected to roar ahead, Latin America will stabilize, and Eastern
Europe will continue its recovery. Overall, we expect global premium
revenue growth to range between 4.0% and 5.0% in 2017 (in nominal
terms, adjusted for foreign currency translation effects). Given the
still challenging pricing outlook and weak investment income, overall
profitability might not improve but stay more or less flat.

In the life sector the overall picture is quite similar. Specifically,
we expect advanced markets to maintain their (modest) growth as
demand benefits from rising employment and new product offers.
Emerging markets, on the other hand, will show stronger perfor-
mance. Asia might shift down a little after the extraordinary growth
spurt seen in 2016; on a general note, however, rising incomes, urban-
ization, and social security reforms should remain strong engines for
growing insurance demand. All in all, we expect global premium
revenue to increase by 4.0% to 5.0% in 2017 (in nominal terms, adjusted
for foreign currency translation effects). To safeguard profitability,

52

insurers will continue to review both their product mixes and their
investment portfolios. As a result, overall profitability should not
deteriorate any further.

Asset management industry outlook

After a sometimes rocky but ultimately benign year for global equities
in 2016, 2017 brings the prospect of increased volatility. This is due in
particular to geopolitical uncertainty, as the new administration
comes to power in the United States and elections are held across
Europe.

Global economic and political divergence creates uncertainty
and volatility thus involving risks, but it also provides opportunities.
For instance, strong economic trends, such as job and wage growth,
as well as a pick-up in inflation should allow the Federal Reserve to
continue with gradual rate increases, driving treasury yields higher.
Bonds are particularly interesting for the growing number of retirees
in developed countries who are looking for a stable stream of income;
also, liability-driven investors may look to further de-risk into bonds
as yields become more attractive.

2017 is expected to be another challenging and disruptive year
for the asset management industry. Markets are volatile and there is
some political uncertainty. In addition, industry profitability remains
under pressure from both continuous flows into passive products
and rising distribution costs. However, digital channels are expected
to continue gaining prominence. Measures aimed at strengthening
regulatory oversight and reporting could also affect profitability in
the asset management sector. In order to continue growing, it is
vital for asset managers to keep sufficient business volumes, ensure
efficient operations, and maintain strong investment performance.

ASSUMPTIONS
Our outlook assumes no significant deviations from the following
underlying assumptions:

Global economic growth is set to continue.
Modest rise in interest rates expected.

— A100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would,
respectively, either raise or lower operating profits by approx-
imately € 0.1 BN in the first year following the rate change.

— No major disruptions of capital markets.

— No disruptive fiscal or regulatory interference.

— Level of claims from natural catastrophes at expected average
levels.

— Average U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate of 1.11.

— A10% weakening or strengthening of the u.s. Dollar versus
our planned exchange rate of 1.11 to the Euro would have
a negative or positive impact on operating profits of approxi-
mately € 0.3 BN, respectively.

Management's assessment of
expected revenues and earnings for 2017

In 2016, our total revenues amounted to € 122.4 BN, a 2.2% decrease on
anominal and a 0.8% decrease on an internal basis compared to 2015.
We expect a rather flat revenue development in 2017, with Property-
Casualty and Asset Management revenues advancing, while Life/
Health revenues are likely to be under pressure due to our selective
focus on profitable growth.

Our operating profit was near the upper end of our target range
in 2016, hitting € 10.8 BN. As of 2017, we will update our operating
profit definition and exclude restructuring charges from the operat-
ing profit unless they are shared with policyholders. Under this
updated definition, our operating profit for 2016 would have been
€ 10.9 BN, with the delta of € 0.1 BN essentially attributable to the Prop-
erty-Casualty business segment. For 2017, we envisage an operating
profit of € 10.8 BN, plus or minus € 0.5 BN, as we expect a slightly nega-
tive development in the Property-Casualty and Life/Health business
segments and a slightly positive development in the Asset Manage-
ment and Corporate and Other business segments — all based on the
updated operating profit definition.

Our net income attributable to shareholders increased, reaching
€6.9 BN in 2016. Consistent with our disclosure practice in the past
and given the susceptibility of our non-operating results to adverse
capital market developments, we do not provide a precise outlook
for net income. However, since our outlook presumes no major dis-
ruptions of capital markets, we anticipate a rather stable net income
for 2017.

PROPERTY-CASUALTY INSURANCE

We expect our revenues to increase by approximately 2% in 2017
(2016: (0.1) %), supported by favorable volume effects and — to a lesser
extent — price effects. This growth is supported by the acquisition of
the commercial portfolio of Aegon in mid-2016, strengthening our
position in the attractive Benelux property-casualty market.

Most of the premium growth in 2017 is expected to come from
our European core markets, including the United Kingdom, Germany,
and Spain. Top-line development will further be supported by positive
trends at Allianz Worldwide Partners, where our B2B2C business
activities are bundled.

Annual Report 2016 — Allianz Group

C — Group Management Report

We believe the overall slow rise in prices we witnessed in a num-
ber of markets in 2016 will continue in 2017. However, as in previous
years, we will keep our focus on achieving strong underwriting results
by adhering to our strict underwriting discipline and will accept a
lower top line if target margins cannot be achieved.

In 2016, our combined ratio was 94.3%. We expect to at least
maintain it at this level in 2017, before reaching our 2018 ambition of
94% or better. This rests on our expectation that the aggregate effect
of improvements in pricing, claims management, and productivity
will compensate for any underlying claims inflation. Despite the high
volatility of natural catastrophes in recent years, we have assumed
that impacts will be in line with our historic claims experience.

As the low-interest-rate environment is likely to persist, invest-
ment income will remain under pressure due to the rather short
duration of investments in the Property-Casualty business segment.
We will continue to take measures to adapt our investment strategy
to ongoing market conditions.

Overall, we expect our 2017 operating profit to be in the range of
€5.0 BN to €5.6 BN (2016: €5.5 BN, based on the updated operating
profit definition, i.e. excluding € 0.1 BN restructuring charges).

LIFE/HEALTH INSURANCE

In 2016, our operating profit of € 4.1 BN exceeded our target range. For
2017, we expect operating profit in our Life/Health business segment
to be between € 3.7 BN and € 4.3 BN.

As pointed out in 2015, RoE is one of the key performance indica-
tors for the steering of our Life/Health business. In 2017, we expect the
RoE of the Life/Health business segment to be between 10.0% and 12.0%.

We will remain focused on shifting our new business mix
towards capital-efficient, unit-linked, and protection products —
thereby addressing customer needs in light of the prolonged low-
yield environment - while maintaining strong shareholder returns,
and building on our strong track record of product innovation.
Furthermore, we will continue to actively manage both our new and
in-force business through continuous repricing, expense manage-
ment, asset/liability management, and crediting strategies in order
to mitigate the impacts of difficult market conditions, particularly
the low interest rates, and maintain our profitability targets.

It must be noted, however, that market volatility, along with the
level of net harvesting, can significantly affect the Life/Health busi-
ness segment results.

ASSET MANAGEMENT
We see a challenging environment for the asset management industry
again in 2017. That said, we expect the positive trend in PIMCo’s third-
party AuM net inflows that we observed over the last two quarters of
2016 to continue into 2017, supported by net inflows from AllianzGi
in 2017. Market returns are expected to contribute moderately to a
positive development of total AuM. While performance fees are
expected to decrease slightly, an increase in management and loading
fees should lead to a slight increase in operating revenues, which
should more than offset a moderate increase of operating expenses.
Therefore, we envisage our operating profit to be in the range of € 2.0 BN
and € 2.6 BN in 2017 (2016: € 2.2 BN).

In 2017, we expect a cost-income ratio of well below 65% (2016:
63.4%), supported by our focus on expense discipline and operational
excellence. Mid-term we expect our cost-income ratio to be at 60%.

C — Group Management Report

CORPORATE AND OTHER

Our Corporate and Other business segment recorded an operating
loss of € 0.9 BN in 2016. As we expect an improvement in the operating
result of the Holding & Treasury reportable segment - mainly attrib-
utable to lower administrative expenses -, we predict an operating
loss in the range of € 0.7 BN to € 0.9 BN for Corporate and Other (includ-
ing consolidation) in 2017.

Financing and liquidity
development and capitalization

The Allianz Group maintains a healthy liquidity position, combined
with superior financial strength and capitalization well above what
supervisory authorities currently require.

We expect to have steady access to financial markets at reason-
able cost in order to maintain our strong financial flexibility. This is
supported by prudent steering of our liquidity resources and a matu-
rity profile focusing on a long-dated average remaining term.

We closely monitor the capital positions of the Group and at the
operating entity level. Additionally, we will continue to optimize our
interest rate and spread sensitivities through asset/liability manage-
ment and life product design.

Expected dividend development?

For 2016, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of
Allianz SE propose a dividend of € 7.60 per share.

In addition, Allianz sE has decided to launch a share buy-back
program with a volume of up to €3.0 BN as part of a previously
announced plan to return unused capital from the Group’s external
growth budget from the period 2014 to 2016. The buy-back program
started in February 2017 and is envisaged to last no longer than 12
months. Allianz sE will cancel all repurchased shares.

Through capital management, Allianz Group aims for a healthy
balance between an attractive yield and investment in profitable
growth. We will continue to return 50% of Allianz Group's net income
(attributable to shareholders) to shareholders in the form of a regular
dividend.

1 — This represents the management's current intention and may be revised in the future. Also, the decision
regarding dividend payments in any given year is subject to specific dividend proposals by the Manage-
ment and Supervisory Boards, each of which may elect to deviate if appropriate under the then prevailing
circumstances, as wel as to the approval of the Annual General Meeting.

2For further information on subsequent events, please refer to note 44 to the consolidated financial
statements.

54

Allianz also aims to keep the regular dividend per share at least
at the level paid in the previous year. However, the Board of Manage-
ment and the Supervisory Board of Allianz sE have decided to simplify
Group capital management to make it more flexible. Going forward,
Allianz will return capital to its shareholders on a flexible basis,
rather than following a formulaic approach. Return of capital to share-
holders will no longer be coupled to the unused budget for external
growth and a three-year timeframe.

All of the above remains subject to a sustainable Solvency II ratio
above 160%, which is substantially below our current level of 218%
and 20 percentage points lower than our day-to-day Solvency Ii ratio
target range of 180 to 220%.

Management's overall assessment
of the current economic situation of
the Allianz Group

Overall, at the date of issuance of this Annual Report and given cur-
rent information regarding natural catastrophes and capital market
trends — in particular foreign currency, interest rates, and equities —
the Board of Management has no indication that the Allianz Group is
facing any major adverse developments.

increase was supported by an upswing in unrealized gains, primarily
on debt securities, which resulted from a further drop in interest

Our overall asset allocation remained almost unchanged, compared
to31 December 2015. The increase in assets was caused by unrealized
gains in debt instruments and -to a lesser extent —in equities, mainly
following general market developments in 2016.

Our well-diversified exposure to debt instruments went up —
mainly due to a further decrease in interest rates — from their already
low level of year-end 2015. However, the increase was partly offset by
realizations. About 94% of this portfolio was invested in investment-
grade bonds and loans.? Our government bonds portfolio contained
amongst others — bonds from Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom,
representing shares of our debt instruments portfolio of 4.3%, 2.0%

statements.

and 0.2%, with unrealized gains (gross) of € 3,862 MN, € 1,188 MN and
€ 40 MN. Our covered bonds portfolio contained 41% (31 December
2015: 42%) German Pfandbriefe, backed by either public-sector loans
or mortgage loans. The portfolio shares of French, Spanish and Italian
covered bonds were at 16%, 9% and 8% (31 December 2015: 16%, 10%
and 8%).

Our exposure to equities increased due to positive developments
on major equity markets. Our equity gearing? remained almost
unchanged at 23% (31 December 2015: 24%), as the increase in this
exposure was accompanied by increases in shareholders’ equity and
hedging of the risen exposure against share price declines.

LIABILITIES

PROPERTY-CASUALTY LIABILITIES

As of 31 December 2016, the business segment’s gross reserves for
loss and loss adjustment expenses and discounted loss reserves
amounted to € 65.7 BN, compared to € 65.1 BN at year-end 2015. Ona
net basis, our reserves, including discounted loss reserves were
almost unchanged at € 57.3 BN.!

LIFE/HEALTH LIABILITIES

Life/Health reserves for insurance and investment contracts
increased by € 18.9 BN to € 490.9 BN. The € 5.3 BN increase in aggregate
policy reserves and other reserves before foreign currency translation
effects was mainly driven by our operations in Germany (€ 7.5 BN) and
the United States (€ 6.8 BN, before foreign currency translation effects)
and partly offset by the sale of our South Korean business (€ (10.8) BN,
before foreign currency translation effects). Reserves for premium
refunds increased by € 10.7 BN, due to higher unrealized gains to be
shared with policyholders. Favorable foreign currency translation
effects mainly resulted from the stronger U.S. Dollar (€ 2.8 BN).

CORPORATE AND OTHER LIABILITIES

In comparison to year-end 2015, we recorded a drop in liabilities to
banks and customers amounting to € 13.4BN, and an upswing in
liabilities of disposal groups classified as held for sale of € 13.3 BN.
This shift was primarily driven by the classification of the Oldenbur-
gische Landesbank AG as held for sale. Other liabilities increased by
€ 1.0 BN, mainly due to higher liabilities from cash pooling. The € 1.3 BN
increase in subordinated liabilities was mainly caused by the issuance
of a subordinated bond. Certificated liabilities decreased by € 1.5 BN.

Off-balance sheet arrangements

In the normal course of business, the Allianz Group may enter into
arrangements that do not lead to the recognition of assets and liabil-
ities in the consolidated financial statements under IFRS. Since the
Allianz Group does not rely on off-balance sheet arrangements as a
significant source of revenue or financing, our off-balance sheet
exposure to loss is immaterial relative to our financial position.

The Allianz Group enters into various commitments including
loan and leasing commitments, purchase obligations and other com-
mitments. Please refer to note 39 to the consolidated financial state-
ments for more details.

The Allianz Group has also entered into contractual relation-
ships with various types of structured entities. They have been
designed in such a way that their relevant activities are directed by
means of contractual arrangements instead of voting or similar
rights. Typically, structured entities have been set up in connection
with asset-backed financings and certain investment fund products.
For more details on our involvement with structured entities, please
refer to note 37 to the consolidated financial statements.

Please refer to the Risk and Opportunity Report from (>) page 62
onwards for a description of the main concentrations of risk and
other relevant risk positions.

Liquidity and Funding Resources

Organization

The Allianz Group’s liquidity management is based on policies and
guidelines approved by the Allianz SE Board of Management.
Allianz sE and each of the operating entities are responsible for man-
aging their respective liquidity positions, while Allianz sE provides
central cash pooling for the Group. Capital allocation is steered by
Allianz sE for the entire Group. This structure allows the efficient use
of liquidity and capital resources and enables Allianz SE to achieve
the desired liquidity and capitalization levels for the Group and its
operating entities.

Liquidity management
of our operating entities

INSURANCE OPERATIONS

The major sources of liquidity for our operational activities are pri-
mary and reinsurance premiums received, reinsurance receivables
collected, investment income, and proceeds generated from the
maturity or sale of investments. These funds are mainly used to pay
claims arising from the Property-Casualty insurance business and
related expenses, life policy benefits, surrenders and cancellations,
acquisition costs, and operating costs.

We receive a large part of premiums before payments of claims
or policy benefits are required, generating solid cash flows from our
insurance operations. This allows us to invest the funds in the interim
to create investment income.

Our insurance operations also carry a high proportion of liquid
investments, which can be converted into cash to pay for claims.
Generally, our investments in fixed income securities are sequenced
to mature when funds are expected to be needed.

The overall liquidity of our insurance operations depends on
capital market developments, interest rate levels, and our ability to
realize the market value of our investment portfolio to meet insur-
ance claims and policyholder benefits. Other factors affecting the
liquidity of our Property-Casualty insurance operations include the
timing, frequency, and severity of losses underlying our policies and
policy renewal rates. In our Life operations, liquidity needs are gener-
ally influenced by trends in actual mortality rates compared to the
assumptions underlying our life insurance reserves. Market returns,
crediting rates and the behavior of our life insurance clients — for
example regarding the level of surrenders and withdrawals —can also
have significant impacts.

Annual Report 2016 — Allianz Group

ASSET MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS

Within our Asset Management operations, the most important sources
of liquidity are fees generated from asset management activities.
These are primarily used to cover operating expenses.

BANKING OPERATIONS

The major sources of liquidity in our Banking operations include
customer deposits, interbank loans, and interest and similar income
from our lending transactions. The most important uses of funds are
the issuance of new loans and investments in fixed income securities.
The liquidity of our Banking operations is largely dependent on the
ability of our private and corporate customers to meet their payment
obligations arising from loans and other outstanding commitments.
Our ability to retain our customers’ deposits is equally important to us.

Liquidity management
and funding of Allianz Se

The responsibility for managing the funding needs within the Group,
maximizing access to liquidity sources, and minimizing borrowing
costs lies with Allianz SE. We therefore comment on the liquidity and
funding resources of Allianz SE in the following sections. Restrictions
on the transferability of capital within the Group result mainly from
the capital maintenance rules under applicable company laws as
well as from the regulatory solvency capital requirements for regu-
lated Group companies.

LIQUIDITY RESOURCES AND USES

Allianz SE ensures adequate access to liquidity and capital for our
operating subsidiaries. The main sources of liquidity available for
Allianz SE are dividends received from subsidiaries and funding pro-
vided by capital markets. Liquidity resources are defined as readily
available assets — specifically cash, money market investments, and
highly liquid government bonds. Our funds are primarily used for
interest payments on our debt funding, operating costs, internal and
external growth investments, and dividends to our shareholders.

FUNDING SOURCES

Allianz sk’s access to external funds depends on various factors such
as capital market conditions, access to credit facilities, credit ratings,
and credit capacity. The financial resources available to Allianz sz in
the capital markets for short-, mid- and long-term funding needs are
described below. In general, mid- to long-term financing is covered
by issuing senior or subordinated bonds or ordinary shares.

LONG-TERM DEBT FUNDING

As of 31 December 2016, Allianz sE had senior and subordinated
bonds with a variety of maturities outstanding, reflecting our focus
on long-term financing. As the cost and availability of external fund-
ing may be negatively affected by general market conditions or by
matters specific to the financial services industry or the Allianz
Group, we seek to reduce refinancing risk by actively steering the
maturity profile of our funding structure.

SHORT-TERM DEBT FUNDING

Short-term funding sources available are the Medium-Term Note
Program and the Commercial Paper Program. Money market securities
decreased in the use of commercial paper compared to the previous
year-end. Interest expenses on money market securities increased
mainly due to higher funding costs on average in 2016.

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased in 2016. This
consists of net income plus adjustments for non-cash charges, cred-
its and other items included in net earnings, and cash flows related
to the net change in operating assets and liabilities. Net income after
adding back non-cash charges and similar items went down by
€1.4BN to €9.1 BN in 2016. In addition, operating cash flows from net
changes in operating assets and liabilities, including other items, fell
by € 0.8 BN to € 12.4 BN. This was driven by net cash outflows (after net
cash inflows in 2015) from repurchase agreements and collateral
received from securities lending transactions — in particular at
Allianz se. Higher reserves for insurance and investment contracts
in our Life/Health business segment, mainly in the United States,
Germany and France, partially offset this effect.

Annual Report 2016 — Allianz Group

C — Group Management Report

Net cash outflow used in investing activities declined compared
to the previous year. This was primarily a consequence of net cash
inflows (after net cash outflows in 2015) from financial assets and
liabilities designated at fair value through income, especially in our
Life/Health business segment in Germany and France. Moreover, we
recorded lower net cash outflows from our activities in real estate
held for investment, in particular from our German Life/Health busi-
ness segment. Lower net cash inflows from loans and advances to
banks and customers partly compensated these effects.

Net cash outflow used in financing activities decreased, mainly
due to higher net cash inflows from our refinancing activities! as well
as higher net cash inflows from liabilities to banks and customers,
especially from our banking business. Higher dividend payments to
our shareholders partly offset these effects.

Cash and cash equivalents, including cash and cash equivalents
reclassified to assets of disposal groups held for sale, increased in
2016.

Reconciliations

The previous analysis in our Group Management Report is based on
our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunc-
tion with them. In addition to our figures stated in accordance with
the International Financial Reporting Standards (1FRs), the Allianz
Group uses operating profit and internal growth to enhance the under-
standing of our results. These additional measures should be viewed
as complementary to, rather than a substitute for, our figures deter-
mined according to IFRS.

For further information, please refer to note 5 to the consolidated

Composition of total revenue growth

We believe that an understanding of our total revenue performance
is enhanced when the effects of foreign currency translation as well
as acquisitions, disposals, and transfers (or “changes in scope of
consolidation”) are analyzed separately. Accordingly, in addition to
presenting nominal total revenue growth, we also present internal
growth, which excludes these effects.

Risk and Opportunity Report

Target and strategy of risk management

For the benefit of shareholders and policyholders alike, Allianz’s aim
is to ensure that the Group is adequately capitalized at all times and
that all operating entities at least meet their respective regulatory
capital requirements. Furthermore, risk capital — reflecting our risk
profile — and cost of capital are important aspects taken into account
in business decisions.

In addition, we take into account the requirements of regulators
and rating agencies. While capital requirements imposed by regula-
tors constitute a binding constraint, meeting rating agencies’ capital
requirements and maintaining strong credit ratings are strategic
business objectives of the Allianz Group.

We closely monitor the capital position of the Group and its
operating entities along each of these dimensions, and apply regular
stress tests (standardized, historical, and reverse stress test scenarios
as well as monthly stress scenarios focusing on current and possible
future developments). This allows us to take appropriate measures to
ensure our continued capital and solvency strength.

For this the risk management system described in the following
is applied.

Risk governance

RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

As a provider of financial services, we consider risk management to
be one of our core competencies. It is therefore an integral part of our
business process. Our risk management framework is risk-based and
covers all operations including IT, processes, products, and depart-
ments as well as subsidiaries within the Group. The key elements of
our risk management framework are:

— Promotion of a strong risk management culture, supported by a
robust risk governance structure.

— Consistent, proportional application of an integrated risk capital
framework across the Group to protect our capital base and sup-
port effective capital management.

— Integration of risk considerations and capital needs into manage-
ment and decision-making processes by attributing risk and allo-
cating capital to the various business segments, products, and
strategies.

This comprehensive framework ensures that risks are identified, ana-
lyzed, assessed, and managed consistently across the Group. Our risk
appetite is defined by a clear limit structure and a risk strategy con-
sistent with the underlying business strategy of the Group. Close risk
monitoring and reporting allows us to detect potential deviations
from our risk tolerance at an early stage at both the Group and oper-
ating entity levels.

62

Our risk management system is based on the following four
essential elements:

Risk underwriting and identification: A sound risk underwriting
and identification framework forms the foundation for adequate risk-
taking and management decisions such as individual transaction
approvals, new product approvals, and strategic asset allocations.
The framework includes risk assessments, risk standards, valuation
methods, and clear minimum standards for underwriting.

Risk strategy and risk appetite: Our risk strategy clearly defines
our risk appetite. It ensures that rewards are appropriate considering
the risks taken and that the delegated authorities are in line with our
overall risk-bearing capacity. The risk-return profile is improved by
integrating the risk considerations and capital needs into decision-
making processes. This also keeps risk strategy and business objec-
tives consistent with each other and allows us to take opportunities
within our risk tolerance.

Risk reporting and monitoring: Our comprehensive qualitative
and quantitative risk reporting and monitoring framework provides
senior management with the transparency and risk indicators to help
them decide on our overall risk profile and assess whether it falls
within delegated limits and authorities. For example, risk dash-
boards, internal risk allocation, and limit consumption reports are
regularly prepared, communicated and monitored.

Communication and transparency: Finally, transparent and
robust risk disclosure provides the basis for communicating this
strategy to our internal and external stakeholders, ensuring a sustain-
able positive impact on valuation and financing. It also strengthens
the risk awareness and risk culture throughout the entire Group.

OUR STRATEGY

OUR BUSINESS ASPIRATIONS
The Allianz Group seeks to position itself as the world’s most trusted
financial institution through a focus on the following:

— portfolio strength: establishing a strong and high-quality portfolio
in large and attractive markets,

— market leadership: maintaining a commanding position in each
market with superior skills and scale,

— customer centricity: practicing relentless execution centered on
customers while outperforming competition.

These aspirations have been translated into clear ambitions for 2018.
With regard to financial performance, we strive for a return on equity
(excluding unrealized gains/losses on bonds net of shadow account-
ing) of 13%, while growing our earnings per share at a compound
annual growth rate of 5%. To ensure the sustainability of our perfor-
mance, we have set ourselves health targets for customer loyalty and
employee engagement: We expect at least 75% of our businesses to
be or become rated by their customers as Loyalty Leader or above-
market in terms of Net Promoter Score (NPs). At the same time, we
aim to increase our Inclusive Meritocracy Index to 72% (2016: 70%). We
are making good progress in achieving these objectives.

Annual Report 2016 — Allianz Group


--- Page 28 ---

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY

In order to achieve these aspirations the Board of Management of
Allianz sz has defined a clear business strategy consisting of five
pillars:

1. True Customer Centricity: making superior customer experience
the top priority for all our actions,

2. Digital by Default: moving from selected leading assets to become
“Digital by Default” everywhere,

3. Technical Excellence: creating superior margins, innovation, and
growth through best talents and state-of-the-art skills,

4. Growth Engines: systematically exploiting new sources for profit-
able growth,

5. Inclusive Meritocracy: re-inforcing a culture where both people
and performance matter.

The Board of Management of Allianz SE has also defined a strategy
for the management of risks that the Allianz Group faces during the
pursuit of its business strategy. This risk strategy places particular
emphasis on protecting the Allianz brand and reputation, remaining
solvent even in the event of extreme worst-case scenarios, maintain-
ing sufficient liquidity to always meet financial obligations, and pro-
viding resilient profitability.

RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

SUPERVISORY BOARD AND BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
Within our risk governance system, the Supervisory Board and Board
of Management of Allianz sz have both, Allianz sE and group-wide
responsibilities and have set up committees to provide them with
support. Examples include:

Supervisory Board

The Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board monitors the effective-
ness of the Allianz risk management and monitoring framework.
Furthermore, it focuses on risk-related developments as well as gen-
eral risks and specific risk exposures.

Board of Management

The Board of Management formulates business objectives and a cor-
responding, consistent risk strategy. The core elements of the risk
framework are set out in the Allianz Group Risk Policy, which is
approved by the Board of Management.

The Group Finance and Risk Committee (GFRC) ensures over-
sight of the Group’s and Allianz sk’s risk management framework,
acting as a primary early-warning function by monitoring the Allianz
Group’s and Allianz sk’s risk profiles as well as the availability of
capital. The GFRc also ensures that an adequate relationship between
return and risk is maintained. Additionally, the GrRc defines risk
standards, forms the limit-setting authority within the framework set
by the Board of Management and approves major financing and rein-
surance transactions. Finally, the GFRC supports the Board of Man-
agement with recommendations regarding the capital structure, and
the capital allocation and investment strategy, including strategic
asset allocation.

OVERALL RISK ORGANIZATION

AND ROLES IN RISK MANAGEMENT

A comprehensive system of risk governance is achieved by setting
standards related to organizational structure, risk strategy and appe-
tite, written policies, limit systems, documentation, and reporting.
These standards ensure the accurate and timely flow of risk-related
information and a disciplined approach towards decision-making
and execution at both the global and local level.

As a general principle, the “first line of defense” rests with busi-
ness managers in the local operating entities and Allianz Investment
Management units. They are responsible, in the first instance, for
both the risks of and returns on their decisions. Our “second line of
defense” is made up of our independent, global oversight functions
such as Risk, Actuarial, Compliance and Legal. Audit forms the “third
line of defense”. On a periodic basis, Group Audit independently
reviews risk governance implementation, as well as compliance with
risk principles, performs quality reviews of risk processes, and tests
adherence to business standards, including the internal control
framework.

Group Risk

Group Risk is managed by the Group Chief Risk Officer, who reports
to the board member responsible for Finance, Controlling, and Risk.
Group Risk supports the aforementioned Allianz Group committees
responsible for risk oversight through the analysis and communica-
tion of risk management-related information and by facilitating the
communication and implementation of committee decisions. For
example, Group Risk is operationally responsible for monitoring the
limits for risks that accumulate, including natural disasters and
exposures to financial markets and counterparties.

In addition, Group Risk independently supports the adequacy of
the operating entities’ risk management through the development of
a common risk management framework and by monitoring adher-
ence to Group minimum requirements for methods and processes.
Group Risk strengthens the Group’s risk network through regular and
close interaction with the operating entities’ management and with
key areas such as the local finance, risk, actuarial, and investment
departments.

Operating entities

Operating entities are responsible for their own risk management,
including adherence to both external requirements (for example,
those imposed by local regulators) and internal group-wide standards.
The operating entities’ Boards of Management are responsible for
setting and approving a local risk strategy during the annual Strategic
and Planning Dialogues with the Group and for ensuring operating
entities’ adherence to their risk strategy.

In addition, a risk function which is independent from the busi-
ness line management is established by each operating entity. This
function operates under the direction of the operating entity's Chief
Risk Officer. In addition, a local Risk Committee supports both the
operating entity’s Board of Management and the Chief Risk Officer by
acting as the primary risk controlling body. Group Risk is also repre-
sented on the local Risk Committees to enhance the risk dialogue
between the Group and the operating entities.

C — Group Management Report

Other functions and bodies

In addition to Group Risk and the operating entities’ risk functions,
legal and compliance and actuarial functions have been established
at both the Group and operating entity level, constituting additional
components of the “second line of defense”.

Group Legal and Compliance seeks to mitigate legal risks with
support from other departments. The objectives of Group Legal and
Compliance are to ensure that laws and regulations are observed, to
react appropriately to all impending legislative changes or new court
rulings, to attend to legal disputes and litigation, and to provide
legally appropriate solutions for transactions and business processes.
In addition, Group Legal and Compliance is responsible for integrity
management, which aims to protect the Allianz Group, our operating
entities and employees from regulatory risks.

Group Actuarial contributes towards assessing and managing
risks in line with regulatory requirements. These risks stem from the
risk-taking/mitigating activities involving professional actuarial
experience. The range of tasks includes, among others, the calculation
and monitoring of technical provisions, technical actuarial assis-
tance in business planning, reporting and monitoring the results,
and supporting the effective implementation of the risk management
system.

In order to adapt to a continually changing environment, the
Global Issues Forum (GIF) supports the Group in the assessment of
long-term trend changes in the risk landscape on a timely basis.

Risk based steering and risk management

The Allianz Group is exposed to a variety of risks through its core
insurance and asset management activities. These include market,
credit, underwriting, business, operational, strategic, liquidity, and
reputational risks.

With Solvency 1! being the binding regulatory regime since 1 Jan-
uary 2016 and the approval of our partial internal model, risk is mea-
sured and steered based on the risk profile underlying our regulatory
capital requirement. We introduced capitalization limits defining a
target capitalization according to Solvency 1! after applying shock
scenarios on both the Group and the operating entity level. By that
we allow for a consistent view on risk steering and capitalization
under the Solvency 1 framework. This is supplemented by economic
scenarios and sensitivities.

Allianz steers its portfolio using a comprehensive view of risk and
return, i.e. results based on the partial internal risk model including
scenario-based analysis are actively used for decision-making: On the
one hand, economic risk and concentrations are actively restricted by
the limits outlined above; on the other hand, there is a comprehen-
sive analysis of the return on risk capital (RoRC). The latter allows us
to identify profitable lines of business and products on a sustainable
basis, which provide reasonable profits on allocated risk capital over
the life time of the products. Therefore, it is a key criterion for capital
allocation decisions.

As an integrated financial services provider, we consider diversi-
fication across different business segments and regions to be a key
element in managing our risks efficiently by limiting the economic
impact of any single event and by contributing to relatively stable

and others under the deduction and aggregation approach.

64

results and risk profile in general. Therefore, our aim is to maintain a
balanced risk profile without bearing any disproportionately large
risk concentrations and accumulations.

In addition, central elements of Allianz’s dividend policy are
linked to the Solvency 1! capitalization based on our partial internal
model. This shows that the partial internal model is fully integrated
in the business steering of Allianz and that the application of the par-
tial internal model satisfies the so-called “use-test” under Solvency I.

MARKET RISK

With respect to investments, top-down indicators such as strategic
asset allocations are defined and closely monitored to ensure bal-
anced investment portfolios. Furthermore, we have a limit system in
place which is defined at Group level - separately for the Life/Health
and the Property-Casualty business segments —as well as at operating
entity level. The limits comprise economic limits, in particular finan-
cial Value-at-Risk (VaR) and credit VaR as derived from the internal
tisk capital framework, complemented by stand-alone interest rate
and equity sensitivity limits as well as by limits on foreign exchange
exposures.

In order to further limit the impact of any financial market
changes and to ensure that assets adequately back policyholder
liabilities, we have additional measures in place. One of these is asset/
liability management, linked to the internal risk capital framework,
which incorporates risks as well as return aspects stemming from our
insurance obligations. In addition, we are using derivatives mostly to
either hedge our portfolio against adverse market movements or reduce
our reinvestment risk — for example, by using forwards or swaptions.
In addition, guidelines are derived by the Group center for certain
investments — for example, concerning the use of derivatives — and
compliance with the guidelines is controlled by the respective risk
and controlling functions.

Furthermore, we have put in place standards for hedging activi-
ties due to exposures to fair value options embedded in life insurance
products.

CREDIT RISK

The Allianz Group monitors and manages credit risk exposures and
concentrations to ensure we are able to meet policyholder obligations
when they are due. Credit risks are reflected by the internal credit risk
model as well as the obligor group limit management system. Group-
wide credit data is collected following a centralized process and using
standard obligor and obligor group mappings.

The internal credit risk capital model considers the major drivers
of credit risk for each instrument, such as exposure at default, ratings,
seniority, collateral, and maturity. Additional parameters assigned to
obligors are migration probabilities and obligor asset correlations
reflecting dependencies within the portfolio. Ratings are assigned to
single obligors via an internal rating approach which is based on
long-term ratings from rating agencies. It is dynamically adjusted
using market-implied ratings and the most recently available quali-
tative information.

The loss profile of a given portfolio is obtained through a Monte
Carlo simulation, taking into account interdependencies and expo-
sure concentrations per obligor segment. To reflect portfolio-specific
diversification effects, the loss profiles are calculated at different
levels of the Allianz Group structure (pre-diversified). They are then
fed into the overall partial internal risk capital model for further
aggregation across sources of risk to derive group-diversified internal
credit risk.

Annual Report 2016 — Allianz Group


--- Page 30 ---

Our credit insurance portfolio is modeled by Euler Hermes based
ona proprietary model component, which is a local adaptation of the
central internal credit risk module and is reviewed by Group Risk.
Euler Hermes’s loss profile is integrated in the Group’s internal credit
tisk model to capture the concentration and diversification effects. In
our credit insurance business, proactive credit management offers
opportunities to keep losses from single credit events below expected
levels and therefore strongly supports writing business that contrib-
utes to a balanced Group credit portfolio.

To ensure effective credit risk management, credit VaR limits are
derived from our internal risk capital framework, as well as from rat-
ing bucket benchmarks which define our risk appetite for exposures
in the lower investment grade and non-investment grade area.

Our group-wide country and obligor group limit management
framework (CRisP’) allows us to manage counterparty concentration
tisk. It covers credit and equity exposures and is based on data used
by the investment and risk experts at the Group and operating entity
levels. This limit framework forms the basis for discussions on credit
actions and provides notification services with a quick and broad
communication of credit-related decisions across the Group. Clearly
defined processes ensure that exposure concentrations and limit
utilizations are appropriately monitored and managed. The setting
of country and obligor exposure limits from the Group's perspective
(i.e. the maximum concentration limit) takes into account the
Allianz Group’s portfolio size and structure as well as our overall risk
strategy.

UNDERWRITING RISK

PROPERTY-CASUALTY
Our Property-Casualty insurance businesses are mainly exposed to
premium risk and reserve risks as part of the underwriting risk.

Premium risk is subdivided into natural catastrophe risk, terror
tisk, and non-catastrophe risk. We calculate premium risk based on
actuarial models that are used to derive loss distributions. Premium
tisk is actively managed by the Allianz Group and its local operating
entities. The assessment of risks as part of the underwriting process
are key elements of our risk management framework. There are clear
underwriting limits and restrictions, centrally defined and in place
across the Group. In addition to the underwriting limits which are
defined centrally, local operating entities have limits in place that
take into account their business environments. Excessive risks are
mitigated by external reinsurance agreements. All these measures
contribute to a limitation on risk accumulation.

We also monitor concentrations and accumulation of non-mar-
ket risks on a stand-alone basis (i.e. before diversification effects)
within a global limit framework in order to avoid substantial losses
from single events such as natural catastrophes and from man-made
catastrophes such as terror or large industrial accumulations.

Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, storms and floods, rep-
resenta significant challenge for risk management due to their accu-
mulation potential and occurrence volatility. In order to measure such
risks and better estimate the potential effects of natural disasters, we
use special modeling techniques in which we combine portfolio data
(such as the geographic distribution and characteristics of insured
objects and their values) with simulated natural disaster scenarios

1 —Credit Risk Platform,

Annual Report 2016 — Allianz Group

C — Group Management Report

to estimate the magnitude and frequency of potential losses. Where
such stochastic models do not exist, we use deterministic, scenario-
based approaches to estimate potential losses. Similar models and
scenario-based approaches are used to evaluate risk concentrations
and man-made catastrophes, including losses from terrorism and
industrial concentrations, etc.

In general, our operating entities constantly monitor the devel-
opment of reserves for insurance claims on a line-of-business level.”
In addition, the operating entities generally conduct annual reserve
uncertainty analyses. Allianz SE performs regular independent
reviews of these analysis and Allianz SE representatives participate in
the local reserve committees’ meetings.

LIFE/HEALTH

Underwriting risks in our Life/Health operations (biometric risks)
include mortality, disability, morbidity, and longevity risks. Mortality,
disability, and morbidity risks are associated with the unexpected
increase in the occurrence of death, disability, or medical claims on
our insurance products. Longevity riskis the risk that, due to changing
biometric assumptions, the reserves covering life annuities and
group pension products might not be sufficient.

We measure these risks within our partial internal risk capital
model by distinguishing between the different sub-components
whenever relevant or material: absolute level, trend, volatility around
best-estimate assumptions, and pandemic risks. Depending on the
nature and complexity of the risk involved, our health business is
represented in the partial internal model, according to Property-
Casualty or Life/Health calculation methods, and is therefore included
in the relevant Property-Casualty and Life/Health figures accordingly.
However, most of our health business is attributable to the Life/
Health business segment.

OPERATIONAL RISK

Allianz has developed a consistent group-wide operational risk man-
agement framework that focuses on the early recognition and pro-
active management of operational risks in all “first line of defense”
functions. Local risk managers as the “second line of defense” ensure
this framework is implemented in their respective operating entities.

They identify and evaluate relevant operational risks and control
weaknesses via a dialogue between the “first line of defense” and the
risk function. Furthermore, operational risk events are collected in a
central risk event database. Since 2015, Allianz also delivers anony-
mized internal loss data to the “Operational Riskdata eXchange Asso-
ciation (ORx)”, a global operational loss data insurance consortium,
to improve our internal control system and to validate operational
risk parameters.

The risks related to non-compliance or other misconduct are
addressed via various dedicated compliance programs. Written poli-
cies detail the Allianz Group's approach towards the management of
these areas of risk. The implementation and communication of those
compliance programs are monitored by the Group Compliance func-
tion at Allianz se. In close cooperation with the Risk function of the
Group, risk-mitigating measures are taken and enforced by a global
network of dedicated compliance functions throughout the Allianz
Group. With respect to financial statements, our internal control
system is designed to mitigate operational risks.

Financial Reporting from page 75 onward.

C — Group Management Report

Major failures and disasters at our outsourcing providers which
could cause a severe disruption to our working environment may
represent significant operational risks for the Allianz Group. Our
Business Continuity and Crisis Management framework strives to
protect critical business functions from these events and enables
them, for example, to carry out their core tasks on time and at the
highest standard also in a crisis event.

Allianz works on a Cyber and Information Security program on
an ongoing basis, in order to better respond to external develop-
ments and to further strengthen the internal control environment for
related operational risks.

OTHER RISKS

There are certain risks that cannot be fully quantified across the
Group using our partial internal risk capital model. For these risks we
also pursue a systematic approach with respect to identification,
analysis, assessment, monitoring, and steering. In general, the risk
assessment is based on qualitative criteria or scenario analyses. The
most important of these other risks are strategic, liquidity and repu-
tational risk.

STRATEGIC RISK

Strategic risks are evaluated and analyzed in the strategic and plan-
ning dialogue between the Allianz Group and its operating entities
and controlled by monitoring the respective business goals. We also
monitor market and competitive conditions, capital market require-
ments, regulatory conditions, etc., to decide whether to make strate-
gic adjustments.

LIQUIDITY RISK

The main goal of planning and managing Allianz sr’s liquidity posi-
tion is to ensure that we are always able to meet payment obligations.
To comply with this objective, the liquidity position of Allianz sE is
monitored and forecast on a daily basis. Strategic liquidity planning
over time horizons of 12 months and three years is reported to the
Board of Management regularly.

The accumulated short-term liquidity forecast is updated daily
and is subject to an absolute minimum strategic cushion amount
and an absolute minimum liquidity target. Both are defined for the
Allianz sE cash pool in order to be protected against short-term
liquidity crises. As part of our strategic planning, contingent liquidity
requirements and sources of liquidity are taken into account to
ensure that Allianz SE is able to meet any future payment obligations
even under adverse conditions. Major contingent liquidity require-
ments include non-availability of external capital markets, combined
market and catastrophe risk scenarios for subsidiaries, as well as
lower-than-expected profits and dividends from subsidiaries.

Our insurance operating entities manage liquidity risk locally,
using asset/liability management systems designed to ensure that
assets and liabilities are adequately matched. In the course of stan-
dard liquidity planning, we reconcile the cash flows from our invest-
ment portfolio — containing a significant portion of liquid assets (e.g.
government bonds or mortgage bonds with a very good credit rating)
- with the estimated liability cash flows. These analysis are per-
formed at the operating entity level and aggregated at the Group
level.

66

In 2016, we rolled out a newly developed group-wide liquidity risk
framework in order to further strengthen the Allianz liquidity risk
management within Allianz Group and the resilience to stress sce-
narios. This framework considers liquidity sources (e.g. cash flows
from investments and premiums) and liquidity needs (e.g. payments
due to insurance claims) and explicitly takes stress situations for
liquidity sources and needs into account to assess the liquidity and
allows for a group-wide consistent view on liquidity risks.

REPUTATIONAL RISK

Allianz’s reputation as a well-respected and socially aware provider
of financial services is influenced by our behavior in a range of areas
such as product quality, corporate governance, financial perfor-
mance, customer service, employee relations, intellectual capital,
and corporate responsibility.

With the support of Group Communications and Corporate
Responsibility (GCORE), Group Compliance, and the EsG Office!, Group
Risk defines sensitive business areas and applicable risk guidelines
which are mandatory for all operating entities in the Allianz Group.
All Group and operating entity functions affected cooperate in the
identification of reputational risk. GcoRE is responsible for risk
assessment based on a group-wide methodology. Since 2015, Allianz
has embedded conduct risk triggers for fair products and services
into the reputational risk management process.

The identification and assessment of reputational risks are part
of a yearly Top Risk Assessment, during which senior management
also decides on a risk management strategy and related actions. This
is supplemented by quarterly updates. In addition, reputational risk
is managed on a case-by-case basis. Single cases with a potential
impact on other operating entities or the Group have to be reported
to the Allianz Group for pre-approval.

Internal risk capital framework

We define internal risk capital as the capital required to protect us
against unexpected, extreme economic losses, which forms the basis
for determining our Solvency 11 regulatory capitalization and the
associated risk profile. On a quarterly basis, we calculate and consis-
tently aggregate internal risk capital across all business segments.
We also project risk capital requirements on a bi-weekly basis during
periods of financial market turbulence.

GENERAL APPROACH

We utilize an approach for the management of our risk profile and
solvency position that reflects the Solvency 1 rules. This comprises
our approved partial internal model covering all major insurance
operations.? Other entities are reflected based on their standard
model results as well as on sectoral or local requirements, in accor-
dance with the Solvency 1! framework.

INTERNAL RISK CAPITAL MODEL

Our partial internal risk capital model is based on a VaR approach
using a Monte Carlo simulation. Following this approach, we deter-
mine the maximum loss in the portfolio value of our businesses in the
scope of the model within a specified timeframe (“holding period”)
and probability of occurrence (“confidence level”). We assume a con-
fidence level of 99.5% and apply a holding period of one year. In the risk
simulation, we consider risk events from all modeled risk categories
(“sources of risk”) and calculate the portfolio value based on the net
fair value of assets and liabilities under potentially adverse conditions,
including risk mitigating measures like reinsurance contracts or
derivatives.

Risk capital is defined as the difference between the current port-
folio value and the portfolio value under adverse conditions depen-
dent on the 99.5% confidence level. Because we consider the impact
of a negative or positive event on all sources of risks and covered busi-
nesses at the same time, diversification effects across products and
regions are taken into account. The results of our Monte Carlo simu-
lation allow us to analyze our exposure to each source of risk, both
separately and in aggregate. In addition, in particular for market
tisks, we analyze several pre-defined stress scenarios, based on either
historically observed market movements or hypothetical market
movement assumptions. This modeling approach, therefore, also
enables us to identify scenarios that may have a positive impact on
our solvency situation.

Furthermore, there are monthly stress test meetings where
world-wide political and financial developments are examined in
order to understand their potential effects on the Group and to pro-
vide appropriate actions or recommendations to management.

COVERAGE OF THE RISK CAPITAL CALCULATIONS

Allianz’s partial internal risk capital model covers all major insur-
ance operations'. This includes the relevant assets (including bonds,
loans, mortgages, investment funds, equities, and real estate) and
liabilities (including the cash flow run-off profile of all technical
reserves as well as deposits, issued debt, and other liabilities). For
with-profit products in the Life/Health business segment, options
and guarantees embedded in insurance contracts — including policy-
holder participation rules — are taken into account

Smaller entities within the European Economic Area which are
not covered by the partial internal model are reflected based on their
standard model results. At Group level, the capital requirements for
smaller insurance operating entities outside the European Economic
Area that have only an immaterial impact on the Group’s risk profile
are treated with book value deduction’.

Risk capital related to our European banking operations is allo-
cated to the Corporate and Other business segment, based on the
approach applied by banks under the local requirements with respect
to the Basel regulation (Basel standards). Capital requirements for
banks represent an insignificant amount of approximately 1.7%
(2015: 1.5%) of our total pre-diversified risk. Therefore, risk manage-
ment with respect to banking operations is not discussed in more
detail.

C — Group Management Report

For our Asset Management business segment, we assign internal
risk capital requirements based on the sectorial regulatory capital
requirements as defined under Solvency tl. The Asset Management
business is mainly affected by operational risks. However, since most
of our Asset Management business is not located within the Euro-
zone, at the Group level it also bears foreign exchange rate risk. Our
Asset Management business is covered by adequate risk controlling
processes, including regular reporting and qualitative risk assess-
ments (such as Top Risk Assessment) to the Group. However, since it
is mainly affected by the two risk types previously mentioned (opera-
tional and foreign exchange rate), and due to the fact that the impact
on total pre-diversified risk capital is minor, risk management with
respect to Asset Management is not discussed in more detail.

ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

YIELD CURVE AND VOLATILITY ADJUSTMENT ASSUMPTIONS
When calculating the fair values of assets and liabilities, the assump-
tions regarding the underlying risk-free yield curve are crucial in deter-
mining and discounting future cash flows. We apply the methodology
provided by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions
Authority (EIOPA) within the technical documentation (EIOPA-
BoS-15/035) for the extension of the risk-free interest rate curves
beyond the last liquid tenor

In addition, we adjust the risk-free yield curves by a volatility
adjustment in most markets where a volatility adjustment is defined
by Elopa and approved by the local regulator. This is done to better
reflect the underlying economics of our business, as the cash flows of
our insurance liabilities are, to a large degree, predictable. The advan-
tage of being a long-term investor, therefore, is the opportunity to
invest in bonds yielding spreads over the risk-free return and earning
this additional yield component over the duration of the bonds. Being
a long-term investor considerably mitigates the risk of forced selling
of debt instruments at a loss prior to maturity. Therefore, we reflect
this mitigation using a volatility adjustment spread risk offset, and
view the more relevant risk to be default risk rather than credit spread
risk.

VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS: REPLICATING PORTFOLIOS

Since efficient valuation and complex, timely analysis are required
within the context of our partial internal model, we replicate the
liabilities of our Life/Health insurance business as well as for our
internal pension obligations. This technique enables us to represent
all product related options and guarantees, both contractual and dis-
cretionary, by means of standard financial instruments. In the risk
calculation we use the replicating portfolio to determine and revalue
these liabilities under all potentially adverse Monte Carlo scenarios.

DIVERSIFICATION AND CORRELATION ASSUMPTIONS

Our partial internal risk capital model considers concentration, accu-
mulation, and correlation effects when aggregating results at Group
level. This reflects the fact that not all potential worst-case losses are
likely to materialize at the same time. This effect is known as diversi-
fication and forms a central element of our risk management frame-
work.

4—Due to late availabilty of the e10PA publication, the risk-free interest rate term structure used might
slightly differ from the one published by e10PA,

67


--- Page 33 ---

C — Group Management Report

Where possible, we derive correlation parameters for each pair
of market risks through statistical analysis of historical market data,
considering quarterly observations over several years. In case histori-
cal market data or other portfolio-specific observations are insuffi-
cient or not available, correlations are set according to a well-defined
group-wide process. Correlations are determined by the Correlation
Settings Committee, which combines the expertise of risk and busi-
ness experts. In general, we set the correlation parameters to represent
the joint movement of risks under adverse conditions. Based on these
correlations, we use an industry-standard approach, the Gaussian
copula approach, to determine the dependency structure of quanti-
fiable sources of risk within the applied Monte Carlo simulation.

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

Our partial internal risk capital model also includes assumptions on
claims trends, liability inflation, mortality, longevity, morbidity,
policyholder behavior, expense, etc. We use our own internal historical
data for actuarial assumptions wherever possible, and also consider
recommendations from the insurance industry, supervisory author-
ities, and actuarial associations. The derivation of our actuarial
assumptions is based on generally accepted actuarial methods.
Within our internal risk capital and financial reporting framework,
comprehensive processes and controls exist for ensuring the reli-
ability of these assumptions.

LIMITATIONS

Because of the 99.5% confidence level, there is a low statistical prob-
ability of 0.5 % that actual losses could exceed this threshold at Group
level in the course of one year.

We use model and scenario parameters derived from historical
data, where available, to characterize future possible risk events. If
future market conditions differ substantially from the past, for exam-
ple in an unprecedented crisis, our VaR approach may be too conser-
vative or too liberal in ways that are difficult to predict. In order to
mitigate reliance on historical data, we complement our VaR analysis
with stress testing.

Furthermore we validate the model and parameters through
sensitivity analyses, independent internal peer reviews and, where
appropriate, independent external reviews, focusing on methods for
selecting parameters and control processes. To ensure proper valida-
tion we established an Independent Validation Unit (Ivu) within
Group Risk responsible for validating our partial internal model
within a comprehensive model validation process. Overall, we believe
that to the extent possible our validation efforts are effective and that
the model adequately assesses the risks to which we are exposed.

The construction and application of the mentioned replicating
portfolios is subject to the set of available replicating instruments
and might, therefore, be too simple or too restrictive to capture all
factors affecting the change in value of liabilities. As with other model
components, the replications are subject to independent validation
and to suitability assessments as well as to stringent data and pro-
cess quality controls. Therefore, we believe that the liabilities are
adequately represented by the replicating portfolios.

Since the partial internal risk capital model takes into account
the change in the economic fair value of our assets and liabilities, itis
crucial to estimate the market value of each item accurately. For some
assets and liabilities it may be difficult, if not impossible — notably in
distressed financial markets — to either obtain a current market price
or apply a meaningful mark-to-market approach. For such assets we
apply a mark-to-model approach. For some of our liabilities, the

68

accuracy of their values also depends on the quality of the actuarial
cash flow estimates. Despite these limitations, we believe the esti-
mated fair values are appropriately assessed.

MODEL CHANGES IN 2016

At the beginning of the year, a regulatory change in the tax treatment
for the German life sector resulted in a decrease of the risk capital
requirement of € 0.3 BN. There were no major model changes in 2016.
Minor and immaterial model changes during the year slightly
decreased the capital requirement by € 0.4 BN, leading to an overall
negative impact of regulatory and model changes of € 0.7 BN.

Allianz risk profile
and management assessment

RISK PROFILE AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT

As mentioned earlier, the Allianz Group is exposed to a variety of
risks. The largest risks in terms of their contribution to Allianz’s risk
profile are:

— Market risk, especially interest rate risk, due to the duration mis-
match between assets and liabilities for long-term savings prod-
ucts, equity risk, credit and credit spread risks driven by assets
backing long-term liabilities, which we take to benefit from the
expected risk premium;

— Property-casualty premium and reserve risks resulting from
natural and man-made catastrophes as well as from claims
uncertainty.

The risk profile and relative contributions have changed in 2016, pre-
dominantly due to changes in the market environment and manage-

Financial markets are characterized by historically low interest rates
and risk premiums, prompting investors to look for higher-yielding
—and potentially higher-risk — investments. In addition to sustained
low interest rates, the challenges of implementing long-term struc-
tural reforms in key Eurozone countries and the uncertainty about
the future path of monetary policy may lead to continued market
volatility. This could be accompanied by a flight to quality, combined
with falling equity and bond prices due to rising spread levels, even
in the face of potentially lower interest rates. Also, possible asset
bubbles (as observed in the Chinese equity market) might spill over
to other markets, contributing to increasing volatility. Therefore,
we continue to closely monitor the political and financial develop-
ments in the Eurozone — such as Brexit in the United Kingdom and
the “No” vote to constitutional reforms in Italy — in order to manage
our overall risk profile to specific event risks.

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

Following the approval of our partial internal model in November
2015, the model has been fully applied since the beginning of 2016,
starting with the Solvency 1! day one reporting. Nevertheless, some
uncertainty about the future capitalization requirements of Allianz
remains, since the future capital requirements applicable for Global
Systemically Important Insurers (so-called G-si1) are still not final-

ized. Finally, the potential for a multiplicity of different regulatory
regimes, capital standards, and reporting requirements will increase
operational complexity and costs.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT

The Allianz Group’s management feels comfortable with the Group's
overall risk profile and has confidence in the effectiveness of its risk
management framework to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing
environment as well as day-to-day business needs. This confidence
is based on several factors, which are summarized below:

— Due toits effective capital management, the Allianz Group is well
capitalized and met its internal-, rating agency- and regulatory-
solvency targets as of 31 December 2016. Allianz is also confident
that it will be able to meet the capital requirements under new
regulatory regimes. Allianz remains one of the highest rated
insurance groups in the world, as reflected by our external ratings.

— The Group’s management also believes that Allianz is well posi-
tioned to deal with potentially adverse future events, in part due
to our strong internal limit framework defined by the Group’s risk
appetite and risk management practices including our approved
partial internal model.

— The Group has a conservative investment profile and disciplined
business practices in the Property-Casualty, Life/Health, and
Asset Management business segments, leading to sustainable
operating earnings with a well-balanced risk-return profile.

— Finally, the Group has the additional advantage of being well
diversified, both geographically and across a broad range of busi-
nesses and products.

SOLVENCY II REGULATORY CAPITALIZATION

The Allianz Group’s own funds and capital requirements are based
on the market value balance sheet approach as the major economic
principle of Solvency i! rules.! Our regulatory capitalization is shown
in the following table.

ALLIANZ GROUP: SOLVENCY II REGULATORY CAPITALIZATION

as of 31 December 2016 2015
Own funds €BN 75.3 72.7
Capital requirement €8N 34.6 36.4
Capitalization ratio % 218 2001

1— Changed regulatory tax treatment of German life sector reduced our year-end Solvency 1 capitalization
ratio from 200% to 196% on 1 January 2016.

Compared to year-end 2015, our Solvency Il capitalization increased
by 18 percentage points to 218%. This was driven by an increase in
own funds mainly due to strong Solvency II earnings and the sale of
our South Korean life business. This was partly offset by market move-
ments mainly due to decreased interest rates, as well as by dividend
accrual and changes in transferable amount of own funds resulting
from changed risk capital requirements. A decrease in risk capital
also contributed to the overall increase in Solvency 1 capitalization.
This was predominantly due to management actions like the disposal

curve extension, as described in Yield curve and volatility adjustment assumptions on page 67.

C — Group Management Report

of our South Korean life business but also to measures taken to
reduce our exposure to market risks, including hedging of equity
exposure and improving our interest rate risk profile. In addition,
changes in the regulatory tax treatment of the German life sector as
well as minor model changes also slightly contributed to a decreased
capital requirement. This effect, however, was partly offset by market
movements as well as higher exposure due to business growth.

On a pro-forma basis, the recognition of negative interest rates
on solvency capital calculations would have had a negative impact on
the Solvency ratio of around 3 percentage points as of 31 December
2016.

The following table summarizes our Solvency 1! regulatory capi-
talization ratios as disclosed over the course of the year 2016.

Quantifiable risks and opportunities
by risk category

This Risk and Opportunity Report outlines the Group’s risk figures,
reflecting its risk profile based on pre-diversified risk figures and
group diversification effects. Pre-diversified risk figures reflect the
diversification effect within each modeled risk category (i.e. market,
credit, underwriting, business, and operational risk) but does not
comprise the diversification effects across risk categories. Group-
diversified risk figures also capture the diversification effect across
all risk categories. As of 31 December 2016, the group-diversified risk
reflecting our risk profile before non-controlling interests of € 34.6 BN
(2015: € 36.4 BN) represented a diversification benefit? of approxi-
mately 25% (2015: 27%) across risk categories and business segments.

category modeled. All risks are presented on a pre-diversified basis
and concentrations of single sources of risk are discussed accord-

Asan inherent part of our insurance operations, we collect premiums
from our customers and invest them in a wide variety of assets. The
resulting investment portfolios back future claims and benefits to
our customers. In addition, we invest shareholders’ capital, which is
required to support the risks underwritten. As the fair values of our
investment portfolios depend on financial markets, which may
change over time, we are exposed to market risks. The following table
presents our group-wide risk figures related to market risks by busi-
ness segment and source of risk.

Our total pre-diversified market risk showed a decrease of €3.7BN INTEREST RATE RISK

mainly driven by interest rate and equity risk in the Life/Health busi-
ness segment. The decrease in interest rate risk was driven by the
disposal of our South Korean life business as well as by management
actions to improve our interest rate risk profile by asset/liability man-
agement (ALM) measures. Equity risk also decreased due to manage-
ment actions, in particular derivative hedging programs. For credit
spread risk, the decrease was driven by exposure changes, due to ALM
measures, and the corresponding effects on the liability side.

70

As interest rates may fall below the rates guaranteed to policyholders
in some Life/Health markets, and given the long duration of insur-
ance obligations, we are specifically exposed to interest rate risk
because we have to reinvest maturing assets prior to the maturity of
life contracts. This interaction of our investment strategy and obliga-
tions to policyholders forms an integral part of our internal risk cap-
ital framework. In addition, our ALM approach is closely linked to the
internal risk capital framework and designed to achieve investment
returns over the long term in excess of the obligations related to
insurance and investment contracts.

Annual Report 2016 — Allianz Group


--- Page 36 ---

We manage interest rate risk from a comprehensive corporate
perspective: While the potential payments related to our liabilities in
the Property-Casualty business segment are typically shorter in
maturity than the financial assets backing them, the opposite usually
holds true for our Life/Health business segment, due to the long-term
life insurance contracts. In part, this provides us with a natural hedge
onan economic basis at the Group level. As of 31 December 2016, our
interest-rate-sensitive investments excluding unit-linked business
— amounting to a market value of € 428.5 BN! — would have gained
€ 31.4 BN or lost € 36.1 BN in value in the event of interest rates changing
by (100) and +100 basis points, respectively.

As described above, the risk related to interest rates lies in the
fact that, in the long run, yields that can be achieved by reinvesting
may not be sufficient to cover the guaranteed rates. In contrast,
opportunities may materialize when interest rates increase. This may
result in higher returns from reinvestments than the guaranteed
rates.

INFLATION RISK

Asan insurance company we are exposed to changing inflation rates,
predominantly due to our non-life insurance obligations. In addition,
internal pension obligations contribute to our exposure to inflation.
Since inflation increases both claims and costs, higher inflation rates
will lead to greater liabilities. Inflation assumptions are already taken
into account in our product development and pricing, and the risk of
changing inflation rates is incorporated in our partial internal model.
Incase future inflation rates (sustainably) fall short of assumptions,
liabilities would be less than anticipated.

EQUITY RISK

Risks from changes in equity prices are normally associated with
decreasing share prices and increasing equity price volatilities. As
stock-market prices also might increase, opportunities may arise
from equity investments. As of 31 December 2016, our investments
excluding unit-linked business that are sensitive to changing equity
markets— amounting to a market value of € 47.0 BN?- would have lost
€ 12.4BN in value assuming equity markets declined by 30%.

CREDIT SPREAD RISK

Our internal risk capital framework fully acknowledges the risk of
declining market values for our fixed income assets, such as bonds,
due to the widening of credit spreads. However, for our risk manage-
ment and appetite we also take into account the underlying economics
of our business model; for example, the application of the volatility
adjustment in our internal risk capital framework to partially mitigate
spread risk, as described in the section on yield curve and volatility
adjustment assumptions.

CURRENCY RISK

As our operating entities are typically invested in assets of the same
currency as their liabilities, the major part of foreign currency risk
results from the economic value of our non-Euro operating entities.
If non-Euro foreign exchange rates decline against the Euro from a
Group perspective, the Euro-equivalent net asset values also decrease.

However, at the same time the capital requirements in Euro terms
from the respective non-Euro entity also decrease, partially mitigat-
ing the total impact on our capitalization.

REAL ESTATE RISK

Despite the risk of decreasing real estate values, real estate is a suit-
able addition to our investment portfolio, due to good diversification
benefits as well as to the contribution of relatively predictable cash-
flows in the long term. As of 31 December 2016, about 3.3 % (2015: 3.5%)
of the total pre-diversified risk was related to real estate exposures.

CREDIT RISK

Credit risk is measured as the potential economic loss in the value of
our portfolio that is due to either changes in the credit quality of our
counterparts (“migration risk”) or the inability or unwillingness of
the counterparty to fulfill contractual obligations (“default risk”).
Credit risk arises from our fixed income investments, cash positions,
derivatives, structured transactions, receivables from Allianz agents
and other debtors, credit insurance, and reinsurance recoverables.
The following table presents our group-wide risk figures related to
credit risks.

Throughout 2016 the credit environment was mostly stable. Overall
credit risk for the Group decreased compared to last year, primarily
driven by the Life/Health business segment due to the disposal of our
South Korean life business as well as an increased loss-absorbing
capacity of technical provisions in the traditional life business, which
decreased the credit risk after policyholder participation. Addition-
ally, active de-risking measures were taken to reduce sovereign
counterparty exposure concentrations. Annual updates based on
extended time series were performed for credit risk parameters like
the transition matrix and asset correlations, which also had a slightly
positive effect on credit risk. These effects were partially offset by the
declining interest rate environment, which generally increased credit
tisk exposures and correspondingly credit risk.

Credit risk comprises risks resulting from the investment port-
folio, from the reinsurance portfolio, and from our credit insurance
business.

CREDIT RISK - INVESTMENT

We invest premiums from our customers into a variety of assets,
which largely consist of fixed income instruments. As the portfolio
value of our investments depends on the credit quality of the port-
folio, we are exposed to credit risk. However, for certain life insurance
products, losses due to credit events can be shared with the policy-
holder.

C — Group Management Report

As of 31 December 2016, the credit risk arising from our invest-
ment portfolio accounted for 86.4% (2015: 88.2%) of our total Group
pre-diversified internal credit risk. Credit Risk in the Life/Health busi-
ness segment is primarily driven by long-term assets covering long-
term liabilities. Typical investments are government bonds, senior
corporate bonds, covered bonds, self-originated mortgages and
loans, as well as a modest amount of derivatives. Due to the nature of
the business, the fixed income securities in the Property-Casualty
business segment tend to be short- to mid-term, which explains the
lower Credit Risk consumption in this segment.'!

The counterparty credit risk arising from derivatives is low, since
derivatives usage is governed by the group-wide internal guidelines for
collateralization of derivatives that stipulate master netting and col-
lateral agreements with each counterparty and require high quality
and liquid collateral. In addition, Allianz closely monitors the credit
ratings of counterparties and exposure movements.

CREDIT RISK — REINSURANCE

Credit risk to external reinsurers arises when we transfer insurance
tisk exposures to external reinsurance companies to mitigate insur-
ance risks. Potential losses can arise either due to non-recoverability
of reinsurance receivables already present at the as-of date or due to
default on benefits under in-force reinsurance treaties.

As of 31 December 2016, 0.5% (2015: 0.4%) of our total Group pre-
diversified internal credit risk was allocated to reinsurance exposures
— of which 46.8% (2015: 52.0%) was related to reinsurance counter-
parties in the United States and Germany.

We focus on companies with strong credit profiles. We may also
require letters of credit, cash deposits, or other financial measures to
further mitigate our exposure to credit risk. As of 31 December 2016,
84.0% (2015: 86.0%) of the Allianz Group’s reinsurance recoverables
were distributed among reinsurers that had been assigned at least an
“A-” rating by Standard & Poor's or A.M. Best. As of 31 December 2016,
reinsurance recoverables not rated represented 15.1% (2015: 13.3%).

credits advanced to clients of the policyholder. If the client of the
policyholder is unable to meet its payment obligations, Euler Hermes
indemnifies the loss to the policyholder.

As of 31 December 2016, 7.4% (2015: 6.5%) of our total Group pre-
diversified internal credit risk was allocated to Euler Hermes credit
insurance exposures, for which the relative increase is primarily
driven by the lower credit risk of the investment portfolio.

UNDERWRITING RISK
Underwriting risk consists of premium and reserve risks in the Pro-
perty-Casualty business segment as well as biometric risks in the
Life/Health business segment. For the Asset Management business
segment and our banking operations, underwriting risks are not rel-
evant.

11—As risks are measured in an integrated approach and on an economic basis, internal risk profile takes
reinsurance effects into account.

Property-Casualty risk changes are mainly driven by exposure and
model updates as well discounting effects. For biometric risk there
was a slight reduction, mainly driven by a minor model change and
the sale of our South Korean life business.

PROPERTY-CASUALTY

Our Property-Casualty insurance businesses are exposed to premium
tisk related to the current year’s new and renewed business, as well
as reserve risks related to the business in force.

Premium risk
As part of our Property-Casualty business operations, we receive pre-
miums from our customers and provide insurance protection in
return. Changes in profitability over time are measured based on loss
ratios and their fluctuations.

We face the risk that underwriting profitability is lower than
expected. The volatility of the underwriting profitability measured
over one year defines our premium risk for the Allianz Group.

The top five perils contributing to the natural catastrophe risk as of
31 December 2016 were: a windstorm in Europe, a flood in Germany,
a hurricane in the us.,a hailstorm in Germany, and an earthquake in
Australia.

Reserve risk

We estimate and hold reserves for claims resulting from past events
that have not yet been settled. If our reserves turn out not the be suf-
ficient to cover claims to be settled in the future, due to unexpected
changes, we will experience losses. Conversely, if reserves turn out to
be too conservative there is a chance of positive returns. The volatility
of past claims measured over a one-year time horizon defines our
reserve risk.

LIFE/HEALTH
Life/Health underwriting risk arises from profitability being lower
than expected due to changes in actuarial parameters. As profitabil-
ity calculations are based on several parameters — such as historical
loss information, assumptions on inflation or on mortality, and mor-
bidity — the realized parameters may differ from the ones used for
calculation. For example, inflation which is higher than what we
incorporated in the calculations may lead to a loss. However, devia-
tions can also be beneficial and lead to additional profit. For example,
a lower morbidity rate than expected will most likely result in lower
claims.

Due to effective product design and the diversity of our products,
there were no significant concentrations of underwriting risks within
our Life/Health business segment as of 31 December 2016."

BUSINESS RISK

Business risks include cost risks and policyholder behavior risks and
are mostly driven by the Life/Health business segment and to a lesser
extent by the Property-Casualty business segment. Cost risks are
associated with the risk that expenses incurred in administering
policies are higher than expected or that new business volume
decreases to a level that does not allow Allianz to absorb its fixed
costs.

In the Life/Health business segment, policyholder behavior risks
are risks related to the unpredictability and adverse behavior of
policyholders in exercising their different contractual options: early
termination of contracts, surrenders, partial withdrawals, renewals,
and annuity take-up options. Assumptions on policyholder behavior
are set in line with accepted actuarial methods and are based on our
own historical data, to the extent available. If data is not available,
assumptions are based on industry data or expert judgment.

There was a minor movement in business risk for our Life/Health
business segment, driven by the sale of our South Korean life business.

As for underwriting risks, a positive deviation from the under-
lying parameters will lead to additional returns. For example, lower-
than-expected expenses in our Property-Casualty business will lead
to an improved combined ratio.

OPERATIONAL RISK

Operational risks represent losses resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes, from personnel and systems, or from external
events — including legal and compliance risk, but excluding losses
from strategic and reputational risk. The operational risk capital is
calculated on a scenario-based approach. Operational internal and
external loss data is used, among others, for the selection of the risk
driving scenarios and is applied for validation purposes.

The decrease shown in the operational risk is driven by the regu-
lar update of local parameters. Foreign currency translation effects
(mainly Euro/u.s. Dollar) play a secondary role. There were no central
operational risk model changes in 2016.

LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that requirements from current or
future payment obligations cannot be met or can only be met on the
basis of adversely altered conditions. Liquidity risk can arise primarily
if there are mismatches in the timing of cash flows on the asset and
liability side. Detailed information regarding the Allianz Group's
liquidity risk exposure, liquidity, and funding — including changes in
cash and cash equivalents — is provided in Liquidity and Funding
Resources from (>) pages7 onwards and in notes 13, 19 and 35 to the
consolidated financial statements.

As inferred from the section on management of liquidity risks
and interest rate risks, they are properly managed and monitored but
not quantified.

Controls over Financial Reporting

The following information is given pursuant to § 289(5) and § 315 (2)
no. 5 of the German Commercial Code (“Handelsgesetzbuch — GB”).

In line with both our prudent approach to risk governance and com-
pliance with regulatory requirements, we have created a structure to
identify and mitigate the risk of material errors in our consolidated
financial statements (this also includes market value balance sheet
and risk capital controls). Our internal control system over financial
reporting (ICOFR) is based on the revised framework developed by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(CoSo) in 2013 and is regularly reviewed and updated. Our approach
also includes the following five interrelated components: control
environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and
communication, and monitoring. These five components are covered
by an Entity-Level Control Assessment Process (ELCA), IT General
Controls (1rGc) and controls at process levels. The ELCA framework
contains controls to monitor the system of governance effectiveness.
In the 1rcc framework we have implemented, for example, controls for
access-right management and for project and change management.

ACCOUNTING AND CONSOLIDATION PROCESSES

The accounting and consolidation processes we use to produce con-
solidated financial statements are based on a central consolidation
and reporting IT solution and local general ledger solutions. The latter
are largely harmonized throughout the Group, using standardized
processes, master data, posting logics, and interfaces for data delivery
to the Holding. Access rights to accounting systems are managed
according to strict authorization procedures.

Accounting rules for the classification, valuation, and disclosure
of all items in the balance sheet, the income statement, and notes
related to the annual and interim financial statements are defined
primarily in our Group accounting manual. Internal controls are
embedded in the accounting and consolidation processes to safe-
guard the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the information
provided in our financial statements.

INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM APPROACH
Our approach can be summarized as follows:

— Weusea top-down, risk-based approach to determine the accounts
and operating entities that should fall under the scope of our
internal control system over financial reporting. The methodology
is described in our ICOFR manual. During the scoping process,
both materiality and susceptibility to a misstatement are consid-
ered simultaneously. The final results are documented in the list
of operating entities under the scope of ICOFR as well as in the list
of significant accounts. In addition to the quantitative ICOER cal-
culation, we also consider qualitative criteria — such as expected
increase in business volume — which are provided by different
Group Centers, Group Audit, and external Audit.

— Then, our local entities identify risks that could lead to material
financial misstatements including all relevant root causes (i.e.
human processing errors, fraud, system shortcomings, external
factors, etc.). After identifying and analyzing the risks, their
potential impacts and probabilities of occurrence are evaluated.

— Preventive and detective key controls over the financial reporting
process have been put in place to reduce the likelihood and
impact of financial misstatements. Ifa potential risk materializes,
actions are taken to reduce the impact of the financial misstate-
ment. Given the strong dependence of financial reporting pro-
cesses on information technology systems, we also implement IT
controls.

— Finally, we focus on ensuring that controls are appropriately
designed and effectively executed to mitigate risk. We have set
consistent documentation requirements across the Allianz
Group for elements such as processes, related key controls, and
execution. We conduct an annual assessment of our control system
to maintain and continuously enhance its effectiveness. Group
Audit and local internal audit functions ensure that the overall
quality of our control system is subjected to regular control-test-
ing, to assure reasonable design and operating effectiveness.
Internal Audit does so through a comprehensive risk-based
approach, which holistically assesses the key controls of the com-
pany’s internal procedures and processes, including local and
group-internal controls over financial reporting.

GOVERNANCE

Responsibility for ensuring the completeness, accuracy, and reliability
of our consolidated financial statements rests with the Chairman of
the Allianz se Board of Management, as well as the board member
responsible for Finance, Controlling, and Risk, supported by Group
Center functions, the Group Disclosure Committee, and operating
entities.

The Group Disclosure Committee ensures that these board
members are made aware of all material information that could affect
our disclosures, and assesses the completeness and accuracy of the
information provided in the quarterly statements, half-year, and
annual financial reports. In 2016, the Group Disclosure Committee
met ona quarterly basis before the quarterly statements and financial
reports were issued.

Subsidiaries within the scope of our control system are individu-
ally responsible for adhering to the Group’s internal governance and
control policy and for creating local Disclosure Committees that are
similar to the Group-level committee. The entities’ CEOs and CFOs
provide periodic sign-offs to the management of Allianz sE, certifying
the effectiveness of their local system of internal controls as well as
the completeness, accuracy, and reliability of financial data reported
to the Holding.
