1. GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY OVERVIEW

1.1. Organizational structure

Banco Sabadell is one of Spain's leading banks, with assets totalling €163,346 million at 31 December
2014.

It offers a broad range of banking products and financial services, including deposits, personal banking,
personal loans, mortgage loans, short- and medium-term funding, insurance, brokerage services,
electronic payment services, and credit and debit cards. Our main customers are small- and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) and individuals in Spain. At the close of 2014 Banco Sabadell had a total of
6.4 million customers, compared with 6.5 million in 2013. At the end of the year we had 2,267
operating branches in Spain. Retail banking services are primarily provided through the branch network.
The group's largest business line is Commercial Banking, with 2,253 branches having this as their main
activity at 2014 year-end. We operate in Spain through a set of brands, each of which is focused on a
specific customer base and/or geographical region.

The group is organized into the following business units:

e Commercial Banking: is the group's largest single business line; it focuses on offering financial
products and services (including bancassurance products) to large and medium-sized enterprises,
SMEs, small retailers, sole proprietors, individuals, and professional and other associations.

In most parts of Spain, the Commercial Banking line operates under the group's flagship brand,
SabadellAtlantico.

It also operates under the following brands:

-SabadellHerrero, in Asturias and Leon.

-SabadellGuipuzcoano, in the Basque Country, Navarra and La Rioja.

-SabadellCAM, in Valencia and Murcia.

-SabadellSolbank, in the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and the southern and south-eastern
coastal areas of mainland Spain, meeting the needs of European residents in Spain.

-ActivoBank serves customers who prefer to do their banking exclusively by telephone or on line.
-SabadellGallego, for the Bank's branches in Galicia.

e Corporate Banking and Global Businesses: this unit offers products and services to large
corporations and financial institutions, both Spanish and international. Its activities encompass
corporate banking, structured finance, corporate finance, development capital, international trade
and consumer finance.

e Markets and Private Banking: this unit offers savings and investment management services to
Banco Sabadell customers, including the analysis of investment options, market trading, active
wealth management and custody services. Markets and Private Banking comprises the following
businesses, which are managed on an integrated basis: SabadellUrquijo Banca Privada, the
Investment, Products and Analysis unit, Treasury and Capital Markets, and Securities Trading and
Custody services.

e Asset Transformation: In late 2014, in view of changing market trends and the high regard in which

the group's Solvia unit is held in the property market, the asset management business was split into
two areas: Banco Sabadell Asset Transformation, which handles the overall management of the
Bank's real estate assets taking an integrated view of the whole process; and Solvia, which will
provide services for real estate asset portfolios for both the group and third parties with a focus on
business and leveraging value.
Asset Transformation has the prime task of taking an integrated approach to the group's real estate
assets and designing and carrying out its asset transformation strategy. Solvia, the group's real
estate business, focuses on real estate services through all stages of the product cycle —property
sales and servicing, land management, preparation and development —and has positioned itself as a
key player in Spain's real estate market.

Banco Sabadell is also developing its business in foreign countries, where it currently has a total of 53

194


--- Page 2 ---

branches and representative offices within its different areas of business.

e BS America: this area is made up of a number of business units, affiliates and representative offices
that engage in corporate banking, private banking and commercial banking. The Bank has the
capacity and experience to provide all types of banking services, from the most complex and
specialized for large corporations, including structured project finance operations, to products for
individuals. The business is carried on through the Banco Sabadell Miami Branch, Sabadell United
Bank and Sabadell Securities.

e BancSabadell d’Andorra: incorporated in the Principality of Andorra, BancSabadell d'Andorra is
owned 50.97% by Banco Sabadell. Its customers consist of medium-to-high earners and leading
companies in the Principality of Andorra.

Banco Sabadell is the parent of a corporate group which at 31 December 2014 comprised 232
companies of which 165 were treated as group undertakings and 67 were associated undertakings; at
31 December 2013, the group consisted of 305 companies of which 177 were group undertakings and
128 were associates.

As regards the Bank's governance structure, the Board of Directors is the highest decision-making body
in the Company and its consolidated group, as it is responsible under the law and the Articles of
Association for managing and representing the institution in all aspects related to the banking business,
supervision and oversight as set out in the Articles of Association and based on the powers granted by
the General Meeting.

Its responsibilities include:

a) approving decisions on business and financial transactions of particular importance to the Company
and the Bank's general strategies;

Strategy Committee

The committee's brief is to report on any matter of a general nature or of particular significance in

1.2. Operating review: objectives achieved and actions implemented

The group's development objectives are focused on profitable growth and the generation of shareholder
value through a strategy of business diversification based on high returns, efficiency and quality of
service together with a conservative risk profile, while maintaining high standards of ethics and
professional conduct combined with sensitivity to stakeholders’ interests.

The Bank has a business model that fosters long-term customer relationships through constant efforts
to promote customer loyalty by adopting an initiative-based, proactive approach. The Bank offers a
comprehensive range of products and services, competent, highly qualified personnel, an IT platform
with ample capacity to support future growth and a relentless focus on quality.

Since the onset of the financial crisis, Spain's banking sector has been going through an unprecedented
process of consolidation. Higher levels of capital, stricter provisioning requirements, the economic
recession and pressure from the capital markets are some of the factors that have driven Spanish banks
to merge and gain in scale, maximize efficiency and strengthen their balance sheets.

199

During the last decade, Banco Sabadell has expanded its geographic presence and increased its market
share in Spain through several acquisitions, the largest of which was Banco CAM in 2012, which
enabled it to notably expand its balance sheet. In 2013 Banco Sabadell was able to undertake further
corporate actions on economically acceptable terms in a context of banking sector restructuring.
Following the acquisition of the Penedés branch network, Banco Gallego and Lloyds Espafa in 2013,
Banco Sabadell is well positioned to grow organically and to benefit from the economic recovery in
Spain.

Synergies from the Banco CAM merger exceeded expectations, with the systems and operational
integration of the Penedés branch network into that of Banco Sabadell being successfully completed in
2013, followed by the integration of Banco Gallego and Lloyds Espafia in 2014.

Acquisitions and organic growth in recent years have enabled Banco Sabadell to reinforce its position in
some of Spain's most prosperous regions (e.g. Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands) and to
increase its market share in other key areas. As of September 2014 Banco Sabadell had shares of
15.1%, 14.2% and 9.2%, respectively, of the credit markets in these regions, which in 2013 together
accounted for 31% of Spanish GDP. At national level, Banco Sabadell has market shares of 7.4% in
lending and 7.2% in deposits according to the most recent information available (October 2014). Banco
Sabadell also has a strong position in other products such as ICO funding, with a market share of 17.5%
(December 2014); commercial loans, with a share of 12.3% (October 2014); direct salary payments,
with 5.7% (November 2014) and POS terminal transactions, with 15.5% (September 2014).

Banco Sabadell remains a leader in cross-border operations through its presence in strategic markets
and by serving companies as they expand abroad; as of November 2014 it had market shares of 25.6%
for documentary credits for exports and 16.9% for imports

In 2014 Banco Sabadell experienced growth in deposit-taking driven by the flight to quality and further
supported by marketing campaigns. As of October 2014 the Bank held an 8.3% share of time deposits
by households and a 13.9% of time deposits by non-financial companies. It was particularly successful in
attracting off-balance sheet funds, which increased as a proportion of the overall balance sheet. Its
share of assets in mutual funds increased from 4.1% to 5.1% during the year.

Since 2007 deposits have been the Bank's primary source of funding, thereby reducing its dependence
on capital markets. Other developments during the year were the successful completion of a €1,250
million public offering of covered bonds on the wholesale market in November and two senior debt
issues for €360 and €500 million for small investors in November and December respectively, which
aroused great interest.

Another aim for 2014 that Banco Sabadell more than accomplished was to reduce the gap between
customers of the former Banco CAM and Banco Sabadell customers in terms of funding margin and
customer loyalty. This was achieved by using a customer-centric business model, personalized customer
management standards based on value creation, and sales processes which included top-flight advisory
and sales support, backed by product-specific sales campaigns.

In 2014, Banco Sabadell also surpassed the service quality level attained in 2011, which had declined
due to the integration of Banco CAM in 2012, and its commercial banking brands were among the first
11 in the Top 50 brands at 2014 year-end according to a survey by Stiga-Equos.

The global financial crisis has led to stricter regulatory requirements as to capital and reserves; Banco
Sabadell has made notable efforts to improve its position in both respects.

The bank booked €2,500 million in allowances in 2014, enabling it to increase its reserves and attain
an overall coverage ratio (loans and real estate) of 13.1%.

On 26 October 2014, the ECB published the results of its Comprehensive Assessment of European
banks, including the Asset Quality Review (AQR) and the stress test, which underlined Banco Sabadell's
sound capital position.

Banco Sabadell is the only Spanish bank whose initial capital ratio was not adjusted as a result of the

AQR, which is the best proof of the rigour and transparency of our provisioning policy. This clearly
evidenced the bank's solvency, beyond any stress test, an aspect which positively surprised the market.

200


--- Page 8 ---

The stress test concluded that Banco Sabadell has a common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 10.26% and
that, in the most adverse scenario considered, that ratio would be 8.33%, well above the required
minimum of 5.5%. With these ratios, it was estimated that Banco Sabadell had surplus capital
amounting to over €1,700 million under the baseline scenario and over €2,200 million under the most
adverse scenario.

These results did not consider the effect of the mandatory convertible bonds (not included in the stress
test even though they mature in 2015) or all of the deductions envisaged under Basel III. If those items
had been considered, the CET1 ratio in the adverse scenario would have been 9.38% (including
convertibles) or 8.8% (fully loaded).

This assessment was a condition precedent for the ECB to undertake its new functions as supervisor of
the Euro area's principal banks in November 2014. Far from being a limited, straightforward exercise,
the comprehensive assessment took almost a year and covered a very significant portion of the Bank's
processes and procedures, requiring a team of some 250 Bank employees to be wholly or partly
occupied on the project.

2. BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND RESULTS
2.1. Global economic and financial environment

In the course of 2014 Europe took decisive steps towards banking union and this helped to maintain
continuity in the normalization of financial conditions in the region. In particular, agreement was
reached on establishing a bank resolution mechanism and single resolution fund. The European Central
Bank (ECB) began to perform its functions as a single banking supervisor. Prior to this it carried out a
comprehensive assessment of the European banking system.

In the global arena political and geopolitical developments were a major focus of attention. Geopolitical
tensions flared in the Middle East and, more especially, in Ukraine. In Europe political events were the
prime cause of uncertainty. The fragmentation revealed by national voting intention surveys has raised
questions over the future governability of certain countries. One example of this is Greece, where an
early election was held at the beginning of 2015. At the time this report went to press the left-leaning
Syriza coalition had just emerged victorious from the 25 January election. The coalition came close to
obtaining an absolute majority. In the end Syriza made an agreement with another party (Independent
Greeks) to form a coalition government.

In 2014 the world economy was characterized by modest growth, with inflation remaining muted. The
sharp fall in the price of oil in the latter months of the year increased the downward pressure on
inflation. Oil prices, affected by demand as well as supply factors, fell by nearly 50% and now stand at
the levels they were at in 2009. The financial markets continued to be supported by accommodative
monetary policies although there were occasional bouts of instability.

In terms of economic activity, the global slowdown in growth masked divergent growth paths in different
countries. In the US the economy staged a gradual recovery and the labour market surprised on the
upside. The Eurozone barely showed any increase in activity as investment remained weak. Investor and
business confidence was weighed down by geopolitical uncertainty over the conflict in Ukraine. The
United Kingdom continued to show robust growth and steadily falling unemployment. In Europe the
European Commission presented a programme, the Juncker plan, whose aim is to mobilize €315 billion
for investment over the period 2015-2017. In Japan an increased tax on consumer spending put a brake
on economic activity in the middle of the year. The emerging markets continued to see a slowdown in
their economic growth. China saw a continuation of the structural deceleration of its economy, which
was constrained by a weak real estate market. In Latin America the dominant theme was economic
fragility and political uncertainty in Brazil. In Mexico, meanwhile, activity saw an upturn albeit at a pace
that was slower than anticipated. The country continued to make progress in implementing structural
reforms. The Russian economy suffered damage from geopolitical instability and falling oil prices. This
fall was a factor affecting oil exporting countries generally.

The Spanish economy stood out as a success story within the Eurozone. Activity recovered after
bottoming out in 2013 and began to create employment for the first time since 2008. Domestic demand

201


--- Page 9 ---

was the main driver behind growth. Rising levels of activity were supported by a more benign financial
climate and a slackening in the pace of budgetary consolidation. At the same time, the construction
industry steadied itself after the dramatic correction it had gone through in the preceding years.
Meanwhile, the process of private sector deleveraging continued throughout the year. The most
significant reform was to make changes in the tax legislation, mainly affecting the Personal Income Tax
("IRPF") and corporation tax. These changes resulted in lower rates of tax and greater restrictions on
certain deductions. In the financial arena, the European Union's financial assistance programme came
to an end in January.

Inflation fell back in all the main developed economies. In the Eurozone, inflation was one of the most
keenly scrutinized variables. Inflation indices consistently surprised on the downside and sank to very
low levels, especially on the European periphery. Surplus capacity, lower commodity prices and the
sluggish growth in bank lending all contributed to the decline. Against this backdrop, forecasts for long-
term inflation in the Eurozone slipped lower. In the US the lack of pressure for pay increases helped
inflation to remain firmly below the Federal Reserve's target. In the UK inflation plunged to levels not
seen since the year 2000. Finally, in Japan inflation rose after the increase in the tax on consumer
spending before falling back into a gradual decline.

The monetary policies pursued by the principal central banks remained accommodative, albeit with
regional variations. The ECB again resorted to stimulus measures to counteract the low level of
inflation. Policy rates of interest were set at historically low levels (0.05%) and the deposit facility rate
was taken into negative territory (-0.20%). The ECB also set up a programme of long-term liquidity-
boosting operations (TLTROs) to encourage banks to increase lending. It also launched programmes for
the purchase of asset-backed securities (ABS's) and covered bonds. The ECB has indicated its general
aim of increasing the size of its balance sheet to levels last seen in early 2012. In such conditions,
given the persistent low level of inflation, it has left the door open for further stimulus measures. As this
report went to press, the ECB was announcing an extension of its asset purchase programme following
its meeting of 22 January 2015. The institution also said that it would buy €60,000 million worth of
assets per month and that it would do so at least until September 2016. The assets to be purchased
will include government bonds. In the US, the Fed brought its asset purchasing programme (US bonds
and mortgage-backed securities) to an end. Despite keeping its key rate at historically low levels, the
Fed thus marked a change of direction in its monetary policy. In the UK, the Bank of England kept base
rates unchanged at 0.50% although some members were in favour of an increase. The BoE also
announced a number of macroprudential measures to cool the property market. In Japan, the central
bank moved aggressively to pull the country out of deflation, including a substantial increase in
government bond purchases. These purchases will absorb virtually the whole of the government's
borrowing requirement for 2015.

In the long-dated bond markets, yields fell sharply in the main developed economies. US bonds found
support in fears over global economic growth and a more uncertain geopolitical environment. German
bond yields sank to all-time lows. The German long bond was boosted by falling inflation, Eurozone
economic weakness and the ECB's accommodative policy stance. On the European periphery, with the
exception of Greece, risk premium continued to tighten significantly. This was spurred by the ECB's
accommodative approach and expectations that it would finally adopt a broad programme of bond
purchases. In Spain bond yields fell to historic lows — lower, even, than in the US. During the year the
three main credit rating agencies upgraded their ratings for Spanish sovereign debt. And Greece was
able to issue long-term debt for the first time since the country was bailed out. Both Portugal and
Ireland gradually regained normal access to global debt markets. In May Portugal exited from its
assistance plan without making any request for further support. In Japan too, yields on government
bonds fell, reaching their lowest-ever level. Massive bond purchases by the Bank of Japan gave rise to
distortions, causing the market to become illiquid at times.

In the currency markets the euro weakened against the dollar and sterling. The divergence between the
monetary policies pursued by the ECB and the two other central banks were the main factor behind
these movements. The weak economic performance of the Eurozone compared with the US and the UK
contributed to the decline. The yen showed a significant depreciation against the dollar in the second
half of the year, sinking to the levels of 2007. The Bank of Japan's policy of monetary easing and the
deterioration of the country's economy after the tax increase drove the yen lower.

In the equity markets, key US stock indices showed gains over the period. The S&P 500, in particular,

rose by 26.9% in euro terms. Some of this improvement in euro terms is explained by the strength of the
dollar. In Europe the Euro Stoxx 50 closed the year without a well-defined rent. The index barely

202


--- Page 10 ---

managed a rise of 1.2%. In Spain the IBEX index was up by 3.7%, in sharp contrast to the 21.4% gain it
had made in 2013.

Financial markets in the emerging markets were affected by high degrees of volatility and sharp
currency-related falls. This was fuelled by uncertainty over the extent of the economic slowdown in
China. Further causes of weakness were political instability and worries over the possible start of
interest rate hikes by the Fed. Dramatic falls in the oil price also stoked financial turmoil in countries
such as Russia and Venezuela. In the case of Venezuela, this even aroused market fears that the
country might have to seek a restructuring of its external debt.

2.3. Financial review

Balance sheet and income statement

Notarial documents formalizing the merger of Banco Gallego and Sabadell Solbank into Banco Sabadell
were registered with the Barcelona Mercantile Register on 14 March 2014. The IT integration of the
business of both undertakings was completed during the first quarter of the year.

This was the culmination of a series of major changes in the structure of the Banco Sabadell group in
the years 2013 and 2014 which can be summarized as follows:

e BMN-Penedés (acquisition of BMN's banking business in Catalonia and Arag6n): included in the
consolidated accounts as from 1 June 2013.

e Sabadell Solbank (acquisition from Lloyds TSB Bank of 100% of Lloyds Bank International and
Lloyds Investment Espafa): included in the consolidated accounts as from 30 June
2013.Sabadell Solbank was subsequently merged with Banco Sabadell in March 2014.

e Banco Gallego: included in the consolidated accounts as from 31 October 2013. Banco Gallego
was subsequently merged into Banco Sabadell in March 2014.

e Acquisition of JGB Bank: on 11 July 2014, Banco Sabadell's subsidiary in Miami, Sabadell
United Bank N.A., acquired and immediately absorbed JGB Bank, N.A.

Only the incorporation of JGB Bank into the group in 2014 had any effect on the inter-year differences in
balance sheet items attributable to changes in the composition of the consolidated group, since all the
other undertakings referred to above (BMN-Penedés, Sabadell Solbank and Banco Gallego) had already
been integrated into the consolidated accounts by 31 December 2013. In the case of the income
statement, however, inter-year comparisons of profit and loss data for 2014 with those of the preceding
year were affected, albeit not to any significant degree, by the successive additions of the four
undertakings, since the first of them was not incorporated into the consolidated accounts until 1 June
2013.

205


--- Page 13 ---

It should be noted that the balance sheet and income statement for 2013 as presented in this financial
review section of the Report of the Directors have been restated to show the impact that the early
adoption of IFRIC 21 would have had in that year.

The consolidated income statement of the Banco Sabadell Group for 2014 showed solid progress over
the year, driven by increasing business volumes in the group's ordinary operations and rising ordinary
margins from those operations. Particularly noteworthy were the good pace of inflows of customer
funds, the strong growth in higher added-value products and, particularly in the second half of the year,
the revival in the demand for credit, especially among small and medium-sized businesses.

Banco Sabadell's solvency was confirmed by the publication of the results of the European Central
Bank's comprehensive assessment of the 130 largest banks in the Eurozone in October 2014. The ECB
report made it clear that Banco Sabadell’s capital ratio does not need to be adjusted and that under the
most adverse scenario it would have a CET1 capital ratio of 8.33%, well above the minimum of 5.5%.
Under this adverse scenario, the Bank's CET1 ratio would be 9.38% if mandatory convertible bonds,
which were not taken into account in the assessment (and most of which are due for conversion in
2015) were included; and 8.8% on a fully loaded basis.

Gross loans and advances to customers (excluding repos) were 75% of the group's total consolidated
assets and amounted to €121,140.8 million at year-end. This item declined by 2.8% year-on-year (mainly
as a result of a reduction in doubtful balances), although demand for credit showed signs of recovering
in the latter months of the year. In the fourth quarter, for example, gross loans and advances (excluding
repos and doubtful loans) increased by €773.1 million.

Mortgage loans were the largest single component of gross lending (close to 45%), amounting to

The evolution of the Group's portfolio of problem assets improved in 2014. Quarter-on-quarter changes in
these loans (doubtful assets plus real estate assets not covered by the Asset Protection Scheme) were
as follows:

The decrease in doubtful assets was reflected in a loan loss ratio (not including assets covered by the
Banco CAM Asset Protection Scheme) of 12.17% at the close of 2014, compared to 13.63% at the end
of 2013 — a fall of 146 basis points. The provision coverage ratio for doubtful assets at 31 December
2014 was 50.3%, compared with 51.6% a year earlier.

The Bank's portfolio of fixed-income assets available for sale is held mainly to stabilise the net interest
income at a stable level. The size of the portfolio was reduced in 2013 but remained largely stable in
2014. The composition of the portfolio according to asset class was as follows:

€million

Asset type Fair value
Treasury bills 39
Government bonds 6,305
Bonds guaranteed by the State 975
Bonds issued by regional governments 1,492
Government securities of other countries 7,714
Securities issued by banks 702
Covered bonds 1,953
Asset-backed securities 31
Other debt instruments 1,183
Total 20,393

The breakdown of the available-for-sale portfolio by maturity was:

&nillion
Maturity Fair value
4 year 843
5 years 3,642
10 years 10,017
Covered bonds 5,891
Total 20,393

The amortized cost of the portfolio was €18,853 million and it showed €1,259 million in net unrealized
capital gains. Returns on the different types of asset ranged from 0.81% to 5.01% and the portfolio
showed an average internal rate of return of 3.10%.

Customer funds increased overall by 4.1% year-on-year in 2014, mainly due to the steady rise in off-
balance sheet funds, particularly in mutual funds managed and distributed by the group.

As of 31 December 2014, customer funds on the balance sheet amounted to €94,460.7 million, very
similar to the figure at the end of 2013 (€94,497.2 million). Balances held in demand deposit accounts
amounted to €43,275.0 million (up 17.4% year-on-year) while balances in time deposits amounted to
€53,395.9 million, a 12.2% decline year-on-year that reflected the downward trend in interest rates in
the financial markets, which drove investors to switch to more attractive investments in a search for
better returns.

Total off-balance sheet customer funds amounted to €30,378.8 million, a 19.7% increase year-on-year.
Within this item, the balance of assets in collective investment institutions rose steadily to reach
€15,705.6 million at 31 December 2014, a 42.5% increase year-on-year, while the balance of assets
under management amounted to €2,918.1 million (€1,927.6 million at 2013 year-end).

Debts represented by marketable securities amounted to €20,196.3 million at 2014 year-end, compared
with €21,166.9 million as of 31 December 2013. This decline was due mainly to a net reduction in
balances of asset-backed securities and mortgage covered bonds.

Total funds under management amounted to €152,185.4 million as of 31 December 2014, an increase
of 2.1% with respect to the balance of €149,122.9 million as of 31 December 2013.

Banco Sabadell and its group ended 2014 with a net attributable profit of €371.7 million after booking
€2,499.7 million in allowances for bad debts, securities and real estate assets.

Net interest income totalled €2,259.7 million in 2014, rising by 24.5% on the previous year's figure,
with the ratio of net interest income to average total assets and the interest margin both increasing
significantly. This upward trend was already observable in the second quarter of 2013 and resulted

mainly from the reduction in funding costs.

211


--- Page 19 ---

In terms of overall annual averages, the net interest margin for the year was 1.38%, 29 basis points
higher than the figure for the previous year (1.09%). The higher average return on average total assets
was the result of several factors, including the rise in interest spreads (due mainly to the lower cost of
customer deposits), lower capital market funding costs, the reduction in problem assets and the
improved profitability of recent acquisitions.

Net interest margins began to widen in the second quarter of 2013 and this rising trend continued to be
seen in each of the following quarters, in both absolute and relative terms. Net interest income rose to
1.49% of average total assets in the fourth quarter of 2014 (compared with 1.17% in the fourth quarter
of 2013).

Dividends received and income from equity-accounted undertakings together amounted to €8.7 million
against €18.4 million in 2013, a decline of €9.7 million. The reduction was due to the fact that the
number for 2013 included a €14.6 million contribution from Centro Financiero BHD which was sold in
December 2013.

Net fees and commissions totalled €860.9 million, a 13.3% increase year-on-year. Increases were
recorded across all categories of fee and commission income (generated on loan and guarantee risks,
services, mutual funds, and the distribution of insurance and pension products) and were mainly
attributable to a good performance by off-balance sheet funds, promotional actions to increase
profitability and the incorporation into the group of businesses acquired in 2013.

Fees and commissions chargeable on loans and guarantees increased by €7.0 million overall, largely
thanks to increased business volumes. Fees for services increased by €34.4 million, with a strong
performance being shown in the securities, credit/debit card and current and demand deposit account
categories, again driven by the growth in business volumes and the inclusion of new businesses in the
consolidated group accounts. Fees and commissions related to mutual funds, insurance and pensions
showed an increase of €66.8 million on the previous year, attributable primarily to the growth of assets
held in collective investment schemes (CIS's) sold by the group or under its management.

Net income from trading totalled €1,763.6 million, including €1,860.7 million in capital gains on the
sale of available-for-sale fixed-income assets. In 2013 net income from trading was €1,479.2 million,
including gains of €927.8 million on the sale of available-for-sale fixed-income assets, €437.3 million on
the sale of held-to-maturity investments, €58.8 million on the sale of equity securities, and €53.6 million
in income from the trading portfolio.

Net gains due to foreign exchange differences totalled €99.6 million, a considerable increase with
respect to 2013 (€67.9 million). This 46.7% year-on-year increase was due mainly to a higher volume of
transactions in 2014 and to a number of currency deals that resulted in positive gains.

Other operating income and expenses showed a negative balance of €192.0 million. A major component
of this item consisted of contributions to the bank deposit guarantee fund amounting to €158.4 million.

Operating expenses (personnel and general) for 2014 totalled €1,773.3 million, of which €40.2 million
were non-recurring in character (consisting essentially of redundancy payments to employees); in 2013,

212


--- Page 20 ---

operating expenses amounted to €1,723.1 million and included €51.4 million in non-recurring expenses
(comprising mainly restructuring costs on the acquisition of Banco Gallego). On a strictly comparable
basis, however, operating expenses for 2014 shrank by 4.4% overall compared with 2013 (personnel
expenses fell by 1.2% and general expenses were reduced by 10.5%).

The increase in gross income in 2014 combined with the policies to hold down operating expenses
resulted in an improved cost: income ratio which at the end of the year stood at 53.14%, down from
64.19% at the end of 2013 (the figures for both years excluded non-recurrent income from trading and
net foreign exchange gains, in accordance with the revised procedure introduced in 2014 and applied
also to 2013).

The profit and loss account explained before resulted in a profit before impairment and other allowances
of €2,749.1 million. Allowances for impairment and other losses (on real estate and financial assets, for
the most part) were €2,499.7 million. Capital gains on asset disposals amounted to €236.9 million and
were made up largely of a €162 million gross capital gain on the sale of the group's debt management
and recovery business and an exceptional payment of €80 million (net of formalization expenses) on the
signature of a reinsurance treaty in respect of the Mediterraneo Vida portfolio of individual life and
permanent disability policies. In 2013, capital gains on asset disposals amounted to €43.9 million,
including net gains of €25.6 million in December 2013 from the sale of Banco Sabadell's stake in
Centro Financiero BHD.

The group's income statement for 2013 included a badwil of €30.3 million, mainly attributable to the
acquisition of Banco Gallego.

After deducting income tax and the share of profit attributed to non-controlling interests, the year-end
profit attributed to the group for 2014 was €371.7 million.

The group's largest business line is Commercial Banking, which provides a range of financial products
and services for large and medium-sized companies, SMEs, businesses and individuals (including private
banking, personal banking and mass market customers), non-residents and professional groups, with a
degree of specialization that provides customers with personalized attention depending on their needs,
whether from experts throughout its multi-brand branch network or via other channels to support the
customer relationship and give access to remote banking services.

The operating environment showed signs of recovery in 2014 and the Bank's sales initiatives helped to
reduce loan defaults, drive up net interest income, build stronger customer relationships, give a major
boost to the insurance business and achieve strong growth in mutual funds. From this perspective,
business performance was positive in both the business and individual customer segments.

The integration of the Spanish branch networks of Banco Gallego and Lloyds International Bank was
completed in the first quarter of 2014, significantly expanding Banco Sabadell's presence in Galicia and
in the foreign resident customer segment.

Net interest income attributable to Commercial Banking amounted to €1,778.4 million in 2014, while
profit before tax totalled €347.8 million. The ROE was 8.0% and the cost/income ratio was 57.6%.
Loans and advances to customers amounted to €79,853 million and assets under management were
€90,785 million.

A key feature of the new organizational model is the creation of teams of "global bankers" specializing
in individual business sectors and establishing a direct presence in customers' target markets, thus
ensuring that Corporate Banking's large corporate customers will benefit from the best possible banking
experience. The model is based on a strategic relationship of closeness to its customers so as to offer
comprehensive solutions tailored to the operational needs of each company and market. Standards of
efficiency and service of the highest order and speedier day-to-day middle office processes are other key
elements of the model.

From a strictly business standpoint, the focus remains on strengthening relations with customers in
Spain and other countries and promoting fee-earning businesses that consume less capital, while
maintaining a rigorous approach to the granting and renewing of loans.

Net interest income attributable to Corporate Banking in 2014 amounted to €162.5 million while profit
before tax totalled €70 million. The ROE ratio was 7.1% and the cost/income ratio was 13.4%.

In 2014 efforts continued to enhance recognition of SabadellUrquijo Private Banking as a leading banker
to high net worth individuals, addressing the needs of customers who demand products and services to
suit their risk profiles and ceaselessly striving to maximize their investment returns.

The sales team worked diligently to increase personal contact with customers by making more frequent
visits and follow-up calls to ensure that customers felt well served. Even greater efforts were directed at
new customers acquired as a result of recent acquisitions.

A significant change in the balance sheet was seen in the composition of customer funds under
management, where mutual funds, discretionary portfolio management services and SICAVs gained
prominence at the expense of more liquid assets with less attractive returns, such as term deposits and
commercial papers, for which there was less demand from investors.

This change in the composition of clients' investment portfolios resulted in an increase in profitability for
Private Banking.

Net interest income amounted to €65.3 million in 2014, while the profit before tax was €29.6 million.

The ROE was 59.3%, and the cost/income ratio was 56.1%. Total customer funds under management
amounted to €24,222 million.

Banco Sabadell's team of highly qualified experts specializes in financial market research and analysis
and in drawing up asset allocation strategies to guide investment decisions; this includes the planning
and development of investment products and a mandate to research any of the various types of asset in
which customers might wish to invest.

The group's Investment Management business encompasses collective investment management
companies, including investment management and the distribution and administration of collective
investment vehicles (UCITS), as well as selecting, offering and recommending third-party funds and
managing the investments of the Banco Sabadell group's other businesses.

Following the integration of Banco Gallego and Lloyds Espajfia in the first quarter of 2014, the Banco
Sabadell group's investment management companies ended the year with €9,952.6 million of assets
under management in Spanish-domiciled mutual funds, 59.1% more than at 2013 year-end, a growth rate
far in excess of that registered by the industry as a whole. This volume of assets under management
brought the group's share of the mutual fund market to over 5%, with its management company,
Sabadell Inversion, being ranked fourth largest manager of Spanish-domiciled mutual funds.

Investors continued to prefer balanced funds in 2014 and assets in this category increased by a factor
of 2.4 to €1,573.6 million. Guaranteed funds continued to be offered throughout the year, with return
guarantees being issued for eight guaranteed funds amounting to €1,492.8 million at 31 December
2014. Assets in guaranteed funds totalled €3,765.7 million. Variable-yield guaranteed funds expanded
to account for 23.0% of total Spanish-domiciled funds under management in 2014, compared with
17.8% in 2013. However, guaranteed funds declined as a proportion of the total, from 44.4% in 2013 to
37.8% in 2014.

The Asset Transformation Department manages the group's real estate exposure and non-performing
exposures; specifically, it is charged with transforming and maximizing the value of these exposures.
The department's structure and organization ensure that it has a broad view of management processes
and can design and implement a transformation strategy to maximize the values of assets and/or
remove them from the balance sheet as soon as possible.

With regard to non-performing exposures, early warning mechanisms have been established and
business tools and solutions have been implemented to manage loan delinquency. Real estate
exposures have been brought within a single comprehensive management process covering all stages
from analysis and preventive action on loans secured on real estate through to direct action on
foreclosed assets. This end-to-end approach has enabled us to work with our customers to find solutions
that meet their real estate needs.

The Group's real estate unit Solvia, which was spun off in 2014, provides a range of real estate
management services for the Group and third parties, from land and property development through to
asset servicing and property sales, thus providing a unified service covering all aspects of the real
estate business. In the provision of real estate services for portfolios of real estate assets (Bank's own-
use or acquired through foreclosures, and third party-owned), personnel and processes were
strengthened and Solvia now has one of the best real estate platforms in the marketplace, as was
clearly seen when Sareb awarded it the contract for the management of a portfolio of 42,900 properties,
citing Solvia's real estate expertise and management capabilities.

We care about the future and about sustainability. This is why Banco Sabadell has an environmental
policy in place, is a signatory to the main international covenants on the environment and promotes a
commitment to the environment globally.

Environmental policy

« Minimize the potential environmental impacts of processes, facilities and services.
« Effectively manage the environmental risks and opportunities inherent in the business.
« Promote a global commitment to the environment

Global covenants and alliances

« A signatory of the United Nations Global Compact: in taking this step we are committing ourselves to
adopting a preventive approach to environmental protection, promoting initiatives to foster
environmental responsibility and supporting the development of technologies that do not harm the
environment.

« A signatory of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and CDP Water Disclosure: a commitment to

All departments of the organization have the financial resources they need to meet the group's aims and
commitments on the environment. Due to the structure of the group and the nature of its business,
these funds are not recognized under a specific line item to provide an overview of environment-related
costs and investment.

No significant fines or other penalties were imposed on the group for non-compliance with environmental
laws and regulations in 2014.

Key environmental action areas:
Renewable energy - finance and investment

Banco Sabadell promotes the development of sustainable energy through direct investment and as a
provider of finance for renewable energy projects. As in previous years, the Bank shared its experience
in the renewables sector and provided speakers at leading forums in Spain. These included events
organized by the Spanish Wind Energy Association and the Association of Renewable Energy Producers.

In 2014 Banco Sabadell provided €141 million in finance for renewable energy generation projects,
mainly in the US. Renewable energy installations financed by the Bank under project finance deals
amount to a total attributable capacity of 161 MW, mostly wind farms.

In addition to finance, Banco Sabadell provides advisory and brokerage services for renewable energy

219


--- Page 27 ---

projects.

The Bank makes direct investments in the equity capital of renewable energy generation projects. Most
of this business is carried on through Sinia Renovables, a wholly-owned subsidiary.

The Equator Principles

Banco Sabadell adopted the Equator Principles in September 2011. Based on the policies, standards
and guidelines of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Principles apply to structured finance
projects and corporate loans. Under the latest version of the Equator Principles (EPIII), in 2014 the
requirement to carry out environmental and social impact assessments was extended to decisions on
corporate loans.

Environmental management and climate change

The Bank's Environment Committee is charged with overseeing compliance with group environmental
policy and reviewing group performance in environmental matters. The group has an environmental
management system which was set up in 2006 according to the ISO 14001:2004 standard. Currently
15% of the group's employees in Spain work in one of the six office buildings that have been certified to
that standard. The environmental management system has been adapted for use at all other group
facilities in Spain.

Year after year Banco Sabadell works to improve the eco-efficiency of its facilities and reduce the
environmental impacts of the services it provides to customers. Some of the measures it has taken to
reduce consumption and emissions are as follows:

e  /nventory of CO2 emissions: \n 2009 the Bank compiled an independently verified inventory of
corporate CO. emissions and set a reduction target of 3% for the period 2009-2013. During this
period a reduction in emissions of 77% has been achieved, mainly by purchasing electrical power
generated from renewable sources.

e Power consumption: overall consumption of electrical power in Spain in 2014 increased to 104,419
MWh from 102,991 MWh in 2013. Despite new undertakings being integrated into the group during
the year 2014, the increase in power consumption was not significant (1%) owing to the energy
efficiency measures being implemented. These measures to reduce power consumption included the
following:

o 79% of group branches are equipped with centralized lighting and climate control systems.
Lighting systems fitted with LED lamps and presence detectors in some areas of Central Service

buildings.

o Widespread use of low-energy lamps and billboard lighting systems fitted with daylight switching
systems.

o Energy recovery climate control systems are installed in Central Service buildings and larger
branches.

o Branches are using Thin Client hardware which consumes 90% less energy than conventional PCs.
In 2014 a pilot programme was launched to install Thin Client technology at Central Service
buildings.

e Paper consumption: Reduce, reuse and recycle. Paper consumption by the group in Spain in 2014
was 1,039 tons (up from 939 tons in 2013). The increase was due to the addition of new
businesses to the group and the rise in customer numbers. At the same time, the main actions put
in hand to reduce paper consumption were as follows:

o Banking services are available to customers 24 hours a day via remote access channels, ATMs,
telephone banking, email or social media. Customers can access 100% of their correspondence
with the Bank electronically.

o Branches are equipped with digital tablets for customers' signatures. In 2014 this made it
possible for 29 million printed forms to be eliminated. There are plans to process more
transactions via tablets in the future and progressively eliminate the use of paper.

o Conventional paper is chlorine-free, certified by the FSC and produced to ISO 9001 and ISO 14001
standards; all of the group's printers are configured for duplex printing by default.

e Water usage: Water consumption is limited to sanitary uses and to some watering of gardens. In

220


--- Page 28 ---

2014 the group's water consumption resulted in costs of €1.1 million (€0.9 million in 2013). With
regard to waste water management, all our facilities and offices are connected to the public sewage
network. Toilet cisterns and taps are fitted with water-saving mechanisms. The main group Central
Service building has a cistern for collecting rainwater and greywater for watering plants.
Landscaped areas have been planted with autochthonous drought-resistant plants.

e Waste management: In 2014 the group generated 883 tons of waste paper and card, up from 594
tons in 2013. In all group premises, used paper is treated as confidential waste for shredding and
100% is recycled through authorized waste managers. All Central Service buildings have facilities for
the separation and collection of packaging, organic matter and batteries). Banco Sabadell works
with Ricoh and the HP Planet Partners programme to manage the collection and reuse of toner
cartridges and disposes of computer waste through authorized waste managers. There are specific
oversight mechanisms for managing waste at branches that are in the process of closing or being
merged.

Environmental training and awareness

All group employees have access to an on-line training course which is obligatory for staff at Central
Service facilities. Additionally, an on-line guide, “Connect with the Environment”, gives employees ready
access to information about the corporate environmental footprint, resource consumption and waste
management at their branch or Central Services facility. The Bank's employees have the use of a car
sharing platform, "BS Carpooling", which gives them the option of sharing a car to get to and from work.
Employees at the main group Central Service building who make use of the platform are entitled to a
reserved parking space. Features and articles about the environment are published in the staff
newsletter, which is now available in digital format.

Banco Sabadell also keeps all its suppliers informed on the group’s environmental policy and
incorporates environmental and social responsibility into its supply chain in a number of ways. In the
group-level procurement process, tenders or offers from suppliers with ISO 9001, ISO 14001/EMAS or
EFQM certification are looked on favourably. Consideration is given to the environmental qualities
(recycled, ecological, good for the environment, etc.) of the products offered. Banco Sabadell's basic
contract with suppliers includes specific clauses on compliance with environmental criteria, human
rights and the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, as well as acceptance of the
Supplier Code of Conduct. In particular, environmental requirements are included in specifications for
products and services that have significant environmental impacts.

4. HUMAN RESOURCES

Human Resources aims to support the transformation of the organization through a people agenda that
is an integral part of its day-to-day business operations and its growth. Its key objective is to maximize
the value-creating potential of Banco Sabadell’s highly skilled workforce by developing their talent,
managing their expectations and fully leveraging their capabilities.

Talent management and human capital form an essential component of the new “Triple” strategic
business plan along with other key action areas of the plan.

The people agenda developed as part of the Triple plan includes drivers of organizational change and
development as well as a wide-ranging and completely updated view of the Human Resources function.

In the area of organizational change and development, three strategic priorities have been identified:
comprehensive talent management (strengthening leadership and fostering a culture in which talent is
planned for and nurtured) to meet the needs generated by growth; raising the bar on employee
performance (a universal model for today’s businesses that allows people performance to be actively
managed); and involving and engaging all employees in the Group's development.

Human resources management - policies and principles

« Human resources policy is grounded in respect for human dignity, fair and competitive remuneration,
transparency and truthfulness in reporting, and lasting cooperation.

Recruitment policy

In line with its human resources policy, Banco Sabadell has a personnel selection process which
ensures that objective criteria are applied in finding the right person for each job and career path. The
group seeks to ensure optimal professional development for its employees by encouraging them to excel
and rewarding hard work. This mutual commitment is set out in the Banco Sabadell Group Code of
Conduct.

In 2014 the Bank worked on a number of initiatives to strengthen and adapt its procedures for recruiting
and attracting talent.

Banco Sabadell is not only competing in an ever more global, dynamic and competitive environment, but
is also currently undergoing a major programme of transformation, expansion and internationalization,
for whose success having the best talent is critical.

Attracting, selecting and recruiting staff are a part of this new environment: a higher intake of new
employees, new job profiles, and geographic dispersion are making it necessary to redesign and update
the procedures, skills, technologies and capabilities used to attract the best candidates and provide
them with a professionally rewarding experience.

To meet this need the Group launched its Talent Graduate Programme, a scheme designed for recent
graduates to give employment to well-qualified young people with high potential, both locally and
internationally, and prepare them to perform roles in the Bank's functional and business areas.

The Programme, in alignment with the Group's corporate social responsibility policy, aims to create jobs
in an age bracket that has suffered particularly severely from unemployment in Spain, and many of
whose members are still searching for their first job.

Equality, work-life balance and integration

Banco Sabadell guarantees equal opportunities in all aspects of its relations with employees —
recruitment, training, promotion, working conditions, remuneration, etc. These principles are also set
out in the Group’s Equality Plan, human resources policy and Code of Conduct.

Equality

In 2010, Banco Sabadell adopted an Equality Plan aimed at avoiding all types of employment
discrimination between women and men in the company, as required by Organic Law 3/2007. Certain
lines of action were established for this purpose, including effective tracking and goal evaluation
systems covering training, promotion and career development, remuneration, work-life balance, gender
violence and sexual harassment. The Equality Plan's steering committee, which consists of employee
and Bank representatives, meets twice per year to monitor progress and compliance with the Plan.

Diversity and integration

Banco Sabadell promotes employee diversity and integration in the workplace and non-discriminatory
recruitment processes. The Group takes action to adapt workplaces wherever necessary according to
special sensitivity protocols established by the industrial medicine unit. The Bank also assists
employees with paperwork in their dealings with municipal, regional and national governments, thus
helping to improve employees’ well-being outside the strictly professional sphere. In compliance with
Spain's Integration of People with Disabilities Act (“LISMI”), the Bank pursues other measures such as
buying services and supplies from special employment centres. In 2014 the Group had 156 employees
with some form of disability (170 at the end of 2013).

Disability is not the only diversity issue that the Bank handles in a special way. Talent in women
employees receives special attention given the important contribution it can make to the Bank's current
and future development. In recognition of this, Banco Sabadell signed an agreement with the Ministry of
Health, Social Services and Equality in 2014 to actively ensure equality and to recognize and value
women's merits and capabilities in its internal training, hiring and promotion processes.

The Group’s aim of making the best use of multigenerational talent is an increasingly important policy
area, given the changing age structure of its workforce.

Work-life balance

Group employees enjoy a series of benefits thanks to an agreement between the Bank and union
representatives on ways of striking the right balance between work and personal and family life. All
employees have been properly informed of these benefits and full details are available on the intranet
and on the Bank's website.

Benefits include time off from work, paid or unpaid (e.g. to nurse an infant); unpaid leave (for maternity
or to care for a relative); leave in special circumstances; paternity leave; and flexitime arrangements.

Compensation policy

Banco Sabadell's compensation policy is based on the principles of internal fairness, external
competitiveness, transparency, differentiation, flexibility, simplicity, confidentiality and communication,
as prescribed by the Group’s human resources policy.

Compensation policy is based on the degree of responsibility attaching to the position and on each
employee’s professional development. This determines Group practice with regard to increases in both
fixed and variable remuneration. In total, 74.2% of the workforce in Spain qualified for variable
remuneration in 2014 (75.3% in 2013).

Other types of benefit are available to employees, including interest-free loans and grants to help with
training or children’s schooling.

Workplace hazards
Banco Sabadell has a policy of constantly striving to improve employees' health and working conditions.

As required by law, the Bank has a health and safety plan setting out policy measures in this area. Each
year it publishes a report on health and safety initiatives which is available on the employee portal and
the Group website.

An initial risk assessment is performed on each new workplace and also on workplaces that have
undergone refurbishment or alterations. A follow-up assessment is performed at a later date to evaluate
both individual workstations and common areas, as well as aspects such as temperature, relative
humidity, lighting, etc. In 2014, 1,624 questionnaires on psycho-social risk were sent out, producing a
70% response rate.

All Banco Sabadell personnel and new employees receive information on workplace hazard prevention
and are required to take an online course in health and safety at work. The training is supplemented by

224


--- Page 32 ---

publications, such as ergonomics factsheets and equipment manuals, related to the specific hazards
affecting bank employees.

Employee development
Training

Banco Sabadell provides employees with function-based training: continuous, progressive training
adapted to each individual's position.

2014 2013
Employees who received training (%) 98% 88%
Investment in training per employee (euro) 365.7 247.3

Figures for Spain.

The “Laude” programme, initiated in 2009, allows employees who undertake Bank in-house training
schemes to be awarded academic qualifications by the University of Barcelona's Institute of Lifelong
Learning (IL3), under the framework of the new European Educational Space. Four different
qualifications may be obtained, depending on the employee's role. Qualifications awarded under the
programme in 2014 were as follows: 145 Higher Diplomas in Banking Products and Services, 25 “Expert
in Commercial Banking”, 7 “Expert in Investment Advisory Services” and 7 “Expert in Bank Branch
Management” qualifications. A total of 5341 people have gained qualifications under the programme
since its inception in 2009. The Bank has also reached agreements with a number of universities to
provide places for student interns.

Leadership development

The Bank has a special Executive Management unit focused on developing senior management's
leadership skills. Bank executives participating in the corporate development program underwent a
psychometric evaluation and a 360 assessment which collected feedback from direct superiors,
colleagues and subordinates. They also received specific strategic leadership training designed to
enhance their leadership and team management skills.

In 2014, management appraisals were performed for all Group Central Services managers, the goal
being to support them in their development in managerial roles and to have a better understanding of
the aspirations, strengths and areas for improvement of each and every Central Services manager. A
total of 1,275 interviews were conducted as part of the appraisal.

One of the main outcomes of this exercise has been the Corporate Management Programme, which is
designed for new department heads and Central Services directors with subordinates working under
them. The Programme is based on developing management and team-building skills, promoting joined-up
management at Central Services divisions and improving familiarity with human resources policies as a
way of managing professional development and promoting success-driven behaviours appropriate to
each role. A total of 131 employees took this training in 2014, its fourth year.

One of the organization's main tools in managing people and focusing on results is the annual
performance review and interview, where managers hold a mandatory one-to-one meeting with their
direct reports, the goal being also to foster professional growth and build trust. During the interview the
employee's performance during the year and their performance assessment, occupational goals and
geographic mobility are discussed. To provide managers with leadership and coaching skills and tools,
two key initiatives were launched last year by the professional development unit: workshops to develop
the skills required to carry out these interviews, and online knowledge pills on the performance
management process for employees joining the Bank as a result of recent mergers.

The Human Resources department also conducts development interviews to assess employees whose

performance is outstanding or who may be underperforming and ascertain their motivations, concerns
and interests in relation to professional development.

Communication, participation and the volunteer programme
Communication

Banco Sabadell has numerous channels of communication between the different levels of the
organization to enhance internal communication and involve employees in the Bank's goals.

The "BS Idea" platform allows employees to propose improvements in any area of the organization. The
platform is also an excellent communication channel by which employees can make queries and share
experiences on products and processes. The ideas with the most votes and those which add the
greatest value to the Bank are considered by the persons in charge of the processes concerned and by
members of a Decision Committee, who together reach a decision on their implementation. The ideas
with the most votes also receive a cash prize.

Participation

Banco Sabadell respects and guarantees employees' basic rights, including freedom of association and
collective bargaining, enshrined in Spanish law. These principles are set out in its Code of Conduct and
human resources policy.

Union representatives represent the entire workforce, not just union members; accordingly, labour
agreements apply to all employees at the level at which the negotiation was conducted (industry, group,
company, etc.). All employees are given one month’s notice of significant changes. Union elections are
held every four years. Banco Sabadell management meets periodically with the general secretaries of
the various trade unions and the latter participate regularly in committees (National Health and Safety
Committee, Equal Opportunities Committee, Training Committee and the Pension Plan Oversight
Committee). Workplaces with more than 50 workers have a works council. Workplaces with between 6
and 10 workers may elect a union representative.

Since 2012 Banco Sabadell has been working on an assistance plan to offset redundancies resulting
from the workforce restructuring that followed the integration of Banco CAM. The assistance plan
concluded in 2014; it was based on two main programmes: helping the 1,250 employees who were
made redundant to find other jobs, and revitalizing business activity in the areas most severely affected
by the Banco CAM lay-offs.

The re-employment plan includes career counselling for affected employees and their spouses with a
view to enhancing their employability. At the end of the plan, 70% of participants (317) had found a new
employment opportunity.

The aim of the business revitalization plan was to restore employment levels, as far as possible, by
supporting entrepreneurship and job creation in the areas most affected by restructuring. It includes an
aid programme based on monetary contributions for newly-created jobs, finance on preferential terms,
one year’s rent-free use of office accommodation or business premises, and professional advice.

At the end of the revitalization plan, 705 new jobs had been created in the Levante region.

The outplacement programme organized by Banco Gallego (acquired by the Group in 2013), which was
taken up by 37 former employees, resulted in a solution in 20 cases and continues to work on the other
17.

Volunteer programme

Social action and corporate volunteer programme initiatives are publicized on the employee portal under
the Solidaris label. The successes achieved year after year led to a substantial increase in the number of
volunteers and in the activities organized in 2014, all of which were aligned with Banco Sabadell's
corporate social responsibility policy and many of which were proposed by the employees themselves.

The participation of 26 teams from the Bank in Oxfam Intermon's Trailwalker event is a perfect
example. A total of 144 people represented Banco Sabadell in the 2014 event, making us the company
with the largest number of employees taking part and raising more than €40,000 to be used for Oxfam's
water management projects in the Sahara.

For the second year in a row, 105 volunteers from the Bank participated in workshops for fourth grade
pupils as part of the Schools Financial Education Programme in Catalonia (EFEC). The collaboration
agreement with Catalonia's regional government and the /nstituto de Estudios Financieros covered 20%
of schools in Catalonia in 2014.

Surveys

The Bank participates in the "Best workplaces" survey conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute,
which covers over 5,000 employers and 1,500,000 employees in 32 countries around the globe. It is
considered the leading survey for measuring employee satisfaction, and will be conducted again in
2015. In 2014 new initiatives were launched to listen to employees and enable them make their voices
heard. A survey to measure the degree of employee commitment to the Bank's current and future
business goals was conducted for the first time. This new form of participation was implemented in view
of the high correlation between employee engagement and business performance.

International expansion

One of the key objectives of the “Triple” business plan is to prepare the Group’s organizational
structures for future international expansion. In 2014 Human Resources completed its proposed
arrangements for International HR management, including functional and governance requirements and
roles and responsibilities for HR at corporate, regional and local level.

New international mobility policies were also defined, based on market benchmarks, with six distinct
programmes being identified according to the purpose and duration of the secondment and the value
provided by the employee.

A talent map of employees with potential for secondment abroad was completed and a roster of 347
employees willing to change locations was compiled.

5. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

5.1 Liquidity

Banco Sabadell's liquidity management policy seeks to ensure that its lending can be financed at a
reasonable cost and within a reasonable time so that liquidity risk is kept to a minimum. In recent years
the Bank's funding policy has focused on generating a positive liquidity gap in the commercial business,
reducing the total amount of funding obtained from the wholesale markets (€23,106 million at 2014
year-end) and increasing the Bank's liquidity position.

Principal sources of funding:

The Group's main source of funding is the customer deposit base (mainly demand deposits and time
deposits captured through the branch network), together with funding from the interbank and capital
markets, where the Bank has a number of short- and long-term funding programmes in place to assure a
suitable diversity of products, maturities and investors. The Bank also holds a diversified portfolio of
liquid assets, most of which are eligible as collateral in funding operations with the European Central
Bank (ECB). At 31 December 2014, the effective value of the Group’s liquid assets stood at €18,827
million (€18,468 million at 31 December 2013). Banco Sabadell participated in the ECB's 3-year
liquidity auctions on 22 December 2011 and 1 March 2012, receiving an overall total of €23,650
million. These borrowings were gradually repaid in 2013 and the balance stood at €8,800 million at 31
December 2013; this was repaid in full in July 2014. The Bank also participated in the ECB's 4-year
TLTRO liquidity auction on 17 December 2014, obtaining €5,500 million, close to the maximum amount
permitted by the Bank’s balance sheet position. At 31 December 2014, Banco Sabadell held €7,200
million in borrowings from the ECB.

The Group's principal sources of funding at the end of the years 2014 and 2013 are shown in the
following table according to the accounting item under which they are recorded:

Gmillion

2014 2013
Deposits from other creditors 98,208 99,363

On-balance sheet customer funds

At 31 December 2014 customer funds on the balance sheet amounted to €94,461 million, compared
with €94,497 million at 2013 year-end and €80,179 million at 2012 year-end. There was a sharp 17.9%
increase in 2013 over 2012, due mainly to acquisitions: that of Banco Gallego in October 2013, and
those of Lloyds Bank’s Spanish subsidiary and Banco Mare Nostrum's branch network in Catalonia and
Aragon in June. There was a shift from time deposits to demand deposits in 2014 due to lower interest
rates. At 31 December 2014 demand deposits (which includes current and savings accounts) had
increased to €43,275 million (up 17.4%) at the expense of time deposits, which shrank by 12.2%.

Customer funds by maturity:

Grillion
More No fixed
2014 3 months 6 months 12 months than12 maturity
Total customer funds 94,461 10.7% 11.6% 19.0% 12.7% 46.0%

Demand deposits 43,275 100.0%
Issues for retail investors 2,547 16.6% 6.0% 46.3% 28.1% 3.0%

The Group's deposit products are distributed through its Commercial Banking and Corporate Banking
and Global Businesses units and its private banking arm, Sabadell Urquijo Banca Privada. Key financial
data for these business units can be found in section 2.4 above.

The upward trend in the Group's deposit base in recent years has made it possible to replace capital
market funding with customer deposits. This has not only helped to boost the Group's earnings but has
also driven down its loan-to-deposit (LTD) ratio from 147% at the end of 2010 to 104% at the close of
2014. The loan-to-deposit ratio is obtained by dividing net lending (adjusted for subsidized finance) by
retail deposits.

228


--- Page 36 ---

Capital market

As a result of deleveraging by the Group and its successful campaign to attract deposits, the proportion
of funding raised on the wholesale markets has declined steadily in recent years. At the end of 2014 the
outstanding balance of capital market funding was €23,106 million, compared with €26.063 million at
the end of 2013. In terms of product type, €14,406 million of the total sourced from capital markets
was raised from mortgage covered bonds, €1.941 million from senior debt (of which €1,059 million
consisted of Spanish government-backed bond issues resulting from the takeover of Banco CAM), €917
million from subordinated debt issues (including Mandatory Convertible Subordinated Debentures
IV/2013 issued as part of the buyback arrangements for Banco Gallego hybrids) and preference
shares, and €4,062 million from preference shares and asset-backed securities sold on the open market.
The maturities of institutional issues by product type at 2014 year-end are shown in note 37 to the
financial statements.

Short-term funding arrangements included a Spanish commercial paper programme whose outstanding
amount cannot exceed €5,000 million and a Euro Commercial Paper (ECP) programme for a nominal
value of up to €3,500 million. The amount of outstanding commercial paper issues directed mainly at
the domestic market remained stable over the year, with a slight reduction in the outstanding amount of
commercial paper placements with non-qualified investors, which was offset by an increase in the
amount placed with institutional investors. At 31 December, the outstanding balance was €2,745
million (net of commercial paper purchased by Group companies). The balance of the ECP programme,
aimed at qualified international investors, expanded slightly from €98.6 million at the end of 2013 to
€165.2 million at 31 December 2014.

As part of the Group's longer-term funding, on 29 April 2014 an issuance programme of non-equity fixed-
income securities with an upper limit of €10,000 million was registered with the CNMV. During 2014,
Banco Sabadell issued bonds totalling €4,087 million under the programme, both for placement on the
market and for retention by the Group. During the year the Group tapped the bond market on a number
of occasions. Banco Sabadell made a public offering of 7-year mortgage covered bonds totalling €1,250
million; three issues of 8- and 9-year mortgage covered bonds totalling €388 million, underwritten in
their entirety by the European Investment Bank (EIB); six issues of senior debt between 1.5 and 5 years
totalling €916.5 million; and 13 issues of structured bonds amounting to €68 million with maturities of
between one and 10 years. Additionally, as part of funding arrangements agreed between the ICO and
Banco Sabadell, the Bank carried out 71 issues of straight bonds with maturities of between two and
six years, all of which were fully subscribed by the ICO for a total of €588.9 million. In current market
conditions the Group would have the ability to carry out debt issues in a variety of formats and
maturities.

Historically the Group has been very active in originating asset-backed securities. It currently has 40
such issues outstanding (including issues by Banco Guipuzcoano, Banco CAM, BMN and Banco
Gallego); a portion was retained by the Group as liquid assets available for use as eligible collateral in
funding arrangements with the European Central Bank, and the remaining bonds were sold on the
capital markets. At the end of 2014 the Group had €4,062.3 million outstanding in asset-backed
securities. For reasons of efficiency six asset-backed issues with relatively small outstanding balances
were redeemed early in 2014.

The capital markets remained upbeat in 2014 and in the market as a whole there was no large-scale
refinancing of maturing debt. This, together with the ECB's economic stimulus measures in the fourth
quarter, resulted in a surplus of liquidity. This situation, together with low interest rates, boosted the
repo market, where counterparty risk-related concerns abated considerably. The net amount of repo
funding at 31 December 2014 was €1,730 million higher in nominal terms than at 2013 year-end.

In addition to these funding sources, Banco Sabadell has a liquidity buffer consisting of liquid assets to
cover possible liquidity needs. Since the start of the crisis, Banco Sabadell has accelerated the process
of building up this liquidity buffer as a first line of defence. At the end of 2011 the size of the Group's
"first-line" liquidity buffer was €11,399 million (that is, market value less the haircut applied by the ECB
in its monetary policy operations to assets with ECB eligibility, and with the reduction in the Liquidity
Coverage Ratio (LCR) in other cases). During 2012 Banco Sabadell continued to strengthen its liquid
asset base by generating a positive funding gap through the branch network, bringing its first-line
liquidity buffer up to €17,396 million by the end of that year. The amount of first-line liquid assets
increased to €19,009 million by the close of 2013. The liquidity buffer was maintained throughout 2014,

229


--- Page 37 ---

at the end of which the Group's first-line reserve amounted to €18,758 million. At the close of 2014,
93% of the Group's liquidity buffer consisted of eligible assets available for discounting in ECB funding
operations. The rest was made up of such assets as the balance of liquid assets classified as of very
high liquidity for LCR purposes but not eligible for discounting with the ECB; the Group's portfolio of
listed equities; and investments in mutual funds and open-end investment companies (SIMCAVs), plus
its net position in the interbank market.

The Group's holdings of assets eligible as collateral to the ECB are shown below, classified by rating
and liquidity class as defined by the Bank of Spain in its Technical Application 1/2013:

In addition to its first-line liquidity buffer, the Group maintains a buffer of mortgage assets and public
sector loans that are eligible as collateral for mortgage and public sector covered bonds, respectively.
At the end of 2014, these provided an additional capability for the issuance of covered bonds — eligible
to be discounted as collateral with the ECB — in an amount of €9,941 million. By the close of the year,
the Group's available liquidity reserve had reached an effective amount of €28,699 million, composed of
the Group's "first line" liquidity reserve plus its year-end capacity to issue mortgage and public sector
covered bonds.

5.2. Capital resources

The way in which the Group’s capital resources are managed is the result of an ongoing capital planning
process. This planning takes account of expected future changes in the economic, regulatory and
business environment, as well as more adverse scenarios. It considers the likely capital consumption of
different areas of activity under different scenarios, and market conditions that are likely to have a
bearing on any actions that are proposed. Capital management is framed within the context of the
Bank’s strategic objectives and the search for attractive shareholder returns, subject always to ensuring
a level of own funds sufficient to cover the risks inherent in the business.

The new regulatory framework on the minimum own funds that Spanish credit institutions must hold,
both individually and on a consolidated basis, the way in which those resources are determined, the
various capital self-assessment processes they must perform and the information they must disclose to
the market entered into force on 1 January 2014. The regulatory framework comprises:

e Directive 2013/36/EU, of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 26 June 2013, on
access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions
and investment firms, amending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC
and 2006/49/EC (generally referred to as CRD IV).

e Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013
on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation
(EU) No 648/2012 ) (generally referred to as CRR).

As a Spanish credit institution, the Group is subject to CRD IV, through which the European Union is
implementing the Basel III capital rules issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)
under phase-in allowances until 1 January 2019. CRD IV has been partially implemented in Spain
through (i) Royal Decree-Law 14/2013, of 29 November, on urgent measures to adapt Spanish

230

legislation to European Union regulations on bank supervision and solvency, and (ii) Law 10/2014 of 26
June on the organization, supervision and solvency of credit institutions.

The CRR, which is directly applicable to Spanish credit institutions, implements the CRD IV
requirements while leaving certain options to national authorities. Under the authorization granted by
Royal Decree-Law 14/2013, the Bank of Spain issued Circulars 2/2014 and 3/2014 on 31 January and
30 July respectively, using certain permanent regulatory options envisaged in the CRR, including those
applicable to the transitory regime on capital requirements and to the treatment of deductions.

According to the requirements established in the CRR, credit institutions must have a total capital ratio
of 8% at all times. However, regulators may exercise their powers under the new regulatory framework
and require that banks maintain additional capital levels.

As required by this new regulatory framework, all allowances of the Bank of Spain’s Circular 3/2008
that would be in conflict with the above-mentioned European regulation were repealed as of 1 January
2014.

Capital resources are grouped into categories according to their capacity to absorb losses, their long- or
short-term nature, and their seniority. The categories of capital, ranked in descending order of
permanence, loss absorption capacity and seniority, are common equity and other first-level capital
instruments, which together form primary (Tier 1) and secondary (Tier 2) capital instruments. The
overall capital base is obtained by adding Tier 1 capital to Tier 2 capital.

In the last four years the Bank has increased its capital base by issuing securities qualifying as primary
capital, which have enabled it to increase its capital by more than €5,000 million.

Mandatory Convertible Subordinated Bonds were converted to shares for €31.35 million in 2014.

All these transactions and events enabled Banco Sabadell to increase its core capital/common equity
to 11.7% in December 2014.

With regard to risk-weighted assets, in 2008 Banco Sabadell was one of the seven Spanish financial
institutions to obtain Bank of Spain approval to use internal credit risk models for the calculation of
regulatory capital under the (then) new capital framework known as Basel II.

Central bank approval meant recognition and endorsement of the risk management and control systems
that Banco Sabadell had begun to develop in the mid-1990s and which have since enabled it to maintain
an excellent credit quality.

Since then, through constant attention to its balance sheet and its capital, and thanks to Regulator-
approved changes in the development of its internal risk models, Banco Sabadell has been able, by a
process that is still ongoing, to respond to increases in capital requirements arising from its
acquisitions: Banco Guipuzcoano, Banco CAM, Banco Gallego, BMN-Penedés, and Sabadell Solbank
(formerly Lloyds Bank).

Even so, risk-weighted assets (RWA) increased by 2.12% in 2014. This was due to the effect of applying

the new rules described above, which introduced new areas of capital consumption connected with
deferred tax assets and significant holdings in financial sector entities, among other aspects.

Results of the comprehensive assessment

In October 2014, the European Central Bank (ECB) conducted a comprehensive assessment of the 128
largest banks in the euro area in cooperation with the national authorities and, for the stress test, in
close collaboration with the European Banking Authority (EBA). The published results concluded that
the values of Banco Sabadell's assets, collateral and reserves were appropriate and that the Bank would
not require additional capital in any of the scenarios considered.

The Comprehensive Assessment (CA) began in November 2013 and was a prerequisite for the ECB to
undertake its new supervisory functions, which it assumed one year later. The CA covered a very
significant part of the processes and procedures of the banks that were analysed.

The CA comprised the following phases:
1. Asset Quality Review (AQR)

The objective of the first phase was to perform a detailed review of bank balance sheets to determine,
inter alia, whether their loan classifications (performing /doubtful), allowances and valuations of specific
assets were appropriate.

The ECB started by reviewing the Bank's main accounting policies, processes and criteria, covering
areas related to funding activities (treatment of refinanced loans, the accounting system for allowances,
and the definition of "doubtful"), and other areas such as consolidation and measurement of financial
instruments, including derivatives.

Next, after selecting the portfolios that represented the highest levels of risk and exposure, the ECB
reviewed a sample of borrowers (based mainly on loan applications). In the case of Banco Sabadell, the
entire loan book was considered, which involved a review of 905 borrowers (including the 210 largest
customers) and re-measurement of more than 1,500 property appraisals.

This phase, which was assisted by leading audit firms and was subject to quality control by the ECB and
the Bank of Spain, had the potential to trigger adjustments to the level of CET1 to be used as the
starting level for the stress test.

2. Stress test

This second phase sought to analyse the ability of banks’ balance sheets to withstand two hypothetical
scenarios: a baseline, or more probable, scenario (macroeconomic scenario approved by the European
Commission) and an adverse or more severe one (established by the European Systemic Risk Board) for
2014-2016.

The test was based on consolidated balance sheets at 2013 year-end and used a bottom-up approach,
applying the methodology defined by the EBA at the lowest level of granularity in the Bank's portfolio,
including in this case all of its lending and all of its exposure to sovereign and corporate debt, investees
and real estate. As a result, all the main credit, market, counterparty and real estate risks were
analysed.

Detailed templates were used to ensure that the exercise was unbiased; as with the previous phase, the
ECB and the Bank of Spain oversaw quality.

The minimum capital threshold was fixed at 8% in the baseline scenario and 5.5% in the adverse
scenario.

Results of the Comprehensive Assessment

According to the published results of the Comprehensive Assessment for each of Europe's 128 largest
banks, 25 institutions failed the test with a capital shortfall totalling €25,000 million. However,
corrective actions implemented in 2014 had reduced the shortfall to €9,500 million, distributed among
13 banks. All Spanish banks passed the stress test and the AQR, with the exception of one minor
institution (as defined by the ECB), whose capital shortfall was duly covered as a result of actions

233


--- Page 41 ---

implemented in the first half of 2014.

Banco Sabadell was the only Spanish bank whose initial capital ratio was not adjusted as a result of the
Asset Quality Review (AQR). Only 15 European banks were not required to make any adjustments.

The stress test concluded that Banco Sabadell had a common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 10.26% and
that in the most adverse scenario considered the ratio would be 8.33%, well above the required
minimum of 5.5%. With these ratios, it was estimated that Banco Sabadell had surplus capital
amounting to over €1,700 million in the baseline scenario and over €2,200 million in the adverse
scenario.

These results did not take account of the effect of mandatory convertible bonds (not included in the
stress test even though they mature in 2015); neither did they include all of the deductions envisaged
under Basel Ill. If those items had been considered, the CET1 ratio would have been 9.38% (including
convertibles) and 8.8% (fully loaded) in the adverse scenario.

The Group's directors believe that these results vindicate the capital-raising actions performed by Banco
Sabadell in the last three years, while also strengthening its competitive position in Spain, and that they
reflect the quality of its financial asset management.

6. RISKS

In 2014, Banco Sabadell Group continued to strengthen its risk management framework and to make
improvements in line with financial sector best practice.

The main challenges this year were developing a new Risk Appetite Framework that ensures control and
proactive management of all the Group's risks, and strengthening the governance framework for risks.

In 2014, the Group also integrated the business from the Banco Gallego and Lloyds Banking Group
Spain acquisitions into its systems by standardizing risk management and control.

Below are the main aspects, which are detailed later in this report.
Risk Appetite Framework

The Banco Sabadell Group has a new Risk Appetite Framework, which aims to ensure control and
proactive management of all Group risks. This new framework includes a Risk Appetite Statement,
which establishes the amount and diversity of risks that the Group seeks and tolerates in order to
achieve its business goals while maintaining a balance between risk and return.

The Risk Appetite Statement comprises quantitative metrics which allow for objective monitoring of risk
management, as well as complementary qualitative aspects. It is implemented throughout the
organization by means of the Risk Appetite Framework, using various instruments, including:

. Risk management policies
. Models

. Tools

. Regulations

. Strategic planning
. Incentives

. Monitoring and reporting

. Pricing
. Communication
. Adequacy protocol

Strengthening risk function governance

The Risk Appetite Framework is covered by an updated risk governance framework in accordance with
European and national regulations (specifically, CRR and CRD IV and their transposition to Spanish law
through Law 10/2014 on the organization, supervision and solvency of credit institutions).

Accordingly, the Bank has strengthened the supervisory role of the Risk Committee, made up of non-
executive Board members, whose main function is to ensure that the risks undertaken by the Group
conform to the Risk Appetite Statement approved by the Board of Directors.

The Group has state-of-the-art risk control systems that is well suited to the activities of its business
units and to the risk profile it pursues. These control systems are built into the Bank's principal risk
acceptance, monitoring, mitigation and recovery procedures.

The Bank's risk control function is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the main risks, ensuring
that all risks identified are supervised effectively by the various business units and always ensuring that
the Bank's risk profile is attuned to the Risk Appetite Statement.

235


--- Page 43 ---

Reviewing compliance with the established control framework and its application to management is the
responsibility of the Internal Audit Department, which advises the Board of Directors and Senior
Management on the effectiveness and adequacy of established processes and controls.

Technological and functional integration of Banco Gallego and Lloyds Banking Group Spain

The integration, in terms of technology and risk management, of the two absorbed banks (Banco
Gallego and Lloyds Banking Group Spain) was concluded in 2014. The loan portfolio acquired from these
banks, and also their branches, are now covered by the Group's risk management framework, in terms of
both acceptance and monitoring.

6.1. General risk management principles

6.1.1 Corporate risk culture

Banco Sabadell's risk culture is one of its distinguishing features and is well established throughout the
organization as a result of continuous development over the decades. Aspects of this strong risk culture
include:

= A high level of involvement by the Board of Directors in risk management and control. The Bank
has had a Risk Control Committee since before 1994, whose main function is to supervise the
management of all significant risks and ensure that they are in alignment with the profile
defined by the Bank.

= The Basic Management Team, a key part of the risk acceptance and monitoring process. The
team structure, which has been in place for more than 20 years, comprises an account manager
and a risk analyst. Each of them contributes their individual view to the management process;
decisions must always be discussed and agreed upon by the parties. This involves the team in
the decision and results in a fuller discussion and a more reliable outcome.

= A high degree of specialization: specific management teams for each segment (Real Estate,
Corporate, Companies, SMEs, Retail Investors, Banks and Countries, etc.), allowing for
specialized risk management in each area.

= Advanced internal credit rating models, which have been a basic component of decision-making
for more than 15 years (since 1999 for individuals and 2000 for companies). The Bank, in
accordance with best practice, relies on these models to improve the general efficiency of the
risk management process.

= The delegation of loan approval authority at various levels, based on expected losses.

= Rigorous monitoring of credit risk supported by an advanced system of early alerts for
companies and individuals. Risk monitoring at customer or risk group level can be organized into
three types: operational, systematic and integral. One of the basic tools for monitoring is an
early alert system for companies and individuals (implemented in 2008 and 2011, respectively)
which provides advance warning of credit risk. These alerts are based on both internal data (e.g.
the number of days an instalment is past-due, limits exceeded on discounted bills, guarantees or
international credit lines), and external data (e.g. customers classified as delinquent elsewhere
in the financial system, and credit bureau reports).

= An advanced model for managing non-performing exposures which enhances early detection and
specialized management. An end-to-end model for managing non-performing exposures which
enables risk management to focus those situations closer to default (early warnings,
refinancing, collection). This comprehensive system has specific tools (simulators to seek the

236


--- Page 44 ---

best solution in each case) and dedicated managers who specialize in specific customer
segments.

= Risk-adjusted pricing. Commercial pricing policy is dynamic, adapting constantly to changing
business and financial market conditions (liquidity premium, difficulty in accessing credit,
interest rate volatility, etc.). Funding and risk costs are taken into consideration (expected loss
and cost of capital). Risk models play a vital role in determining prices and profitability targets.

= The risk management model is fully integrated into the Bank's technology platform, with the
result that policies are applied immediately in everyday processes: the policies, procedures,
methodologies and models that make up Banco Sabadell's risk management approach are built
into the Bank's operating platform. This means that policies are applied immediately in everyday
processes. This proved particularly important when integrating the Bank's recent acquisitions.

= Use of stress testing as a management tool: Banco Sabadell has for some years been using a
powerful calculation tool to perform stress tests, supported by in-house teams with extensive
experience in its development. Considerable progress has also been made in the last year,
including: upgrading the tool (greater granularity, calculation power, etc.), defining potential
uses of the tool and establishing a governance framework.

6.1.2 Risk Appetite Framework

In 2014, the Banco Sabadell Group developed a new Risk Appetite Framework which broadens and
reinforces the existing management framework.

This Framework includes the Risk Appetite Statement, defined as the amount and range of risk that
Banco Sabadell Group seeks and tolerates in order to achieve its business goals while maintaining a
balance between risk and return.

The Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) comprises quantitative metrics, which allow for objective monitoring
of compliance with established targets and limits, and qualitative elements, which complement the
metrics and guide the Group's risk management and control policy.

Quantitative elements

The quantitative metrics in the RAS are organized into six broad sections:

e Capital and Solvency: amount and quality of capital

e — Liquidity: liquidity buffers and funding structure

e Profitability: the right balance of risk and return

e Asset Quality: for the various types of relevant risk, and in stressed scenarios
e Losses: for the various key risks and in stressed scenarios

e Credit and Concentration: individual and sector

237


--- Page 45 ---

Qualitative aspects

In addition to quantitative metrics, the Risk Appetite Framework includes the following qualitative
elements:

The Institution's general position with regard to risk-taking seeks a medium-low risk profile
through a prudent, balanced risk policy that ensures steadily rising profitability and is aligned
with the Group's strategic objectives so as to maximize value creation while guaranteeing an
appropriate level of capital.

The Banco Sabadell Group's risk management and control approach consists of a broad
framework of advanced measurement principles, policies, procedures and methodologies
integrated into an efficient decision-making structure. The risk variable is factored into
decisions in all areas and quantified using a common metric in terms of allocated capital.

Risk management is underpinned by solid, ongoing procedures for checking that risks conform
to pre-set limits, with clearly defined responsibilities for identifying and tracking indicators and
early warnings, and an advanced risk measurement methodology.

Capital and liquidity levels must enable the Bank to cover the risks it has assumed, even in
adverse economic situations.

Risks should not be concentrated in such a way as to significantly compromise own funds.

The assumption of market trading risk seeks to cover the flow of transactions arising from
customer business and to seize market opportunities while maintaining a position that is
commensurate with the Bank's market share, risk appetite, capacity and profile.

The risk function is independent and has strong senior management involvement, ensuring a
strong risk culture focused on protecting capital and ensuring an adequate return on same.

The Board of Directors is committed to the risk management and control processes: approval of
policies, limits, management model and procedures, and the measurement, tracking and control
methodology.

The Group has a risk culture that pervades the entire organization and has units specialized in
managing specific types of risk. The Risk Department transmits this culture by setting policies
and implementing internal models and ensuring that they conform to the risk management
processes.

Risk Management policies and procedures should be oriented to adapting the risk profile to the
Risk Appetite Framework while maintaining and pursuing a balance between expected returns
and risk.

The institution will have sufficient human and technological resources to track, control and
manage all the risks that may materialize in the course of its business.

The Group's compensation systems should align individual interests with compliance with the
Risk Appetite Framework.

238


--- Page 46 ---

6.1.3. Overall organization of the risk function

The Board of Directors is the body responsible for setting general guidelines as to the organizational
distribution of risk management and control functions and for determining the main lines of strategy in
this respect. It is the body responsible for approving the Risk Appetite Framework (developed in
cooperation with the Managing Director, the Director of Risk and the Chief Financial Officer) and
ensuring that it is aligned with the Bank's short- and long-term objectives, as well as with the business
plan, capital planning, risk capacity and compensation programmes.

The Board of Directors has four committees which play a role in the management and control of risk.
The Bank also has several other Committees which participate in this function.

6.2. Managing and monitoring the main risks

6.2.1. Credit risk

Credit risk is the possibility that losses may be incurred as a result of borrowers failing to meet their
obligations or through losses in value due simply to deterioration in borrower quality.

Credit risk management framework
Acceptance and monitoring

To maximize the business opportunities provided by each customer and to guarantee an appropriate
degree of security, responsibility for risk acceptance is shared between the relationship manager and
the risk analyst, who are thus able to obtain a comprehensive view of each customer’s individual
circumstances.

The Board of Directors delegates powers to the Executive Committee, which then sub-delegates
authority at each level. The implementation of authority thresholds in the credit acceptance systems
ensures that powers delegated at each level are linked to the expected loss calculated for each loan.

239


--- Page 47 ---

The analysis of indicators and advanced alerts as well as rating reviews allow for risk quality to be
continuously measured in an integrated way. The establishment of effective processes for managing
existing risk exposures also benefits the process of managing past-due accounts, since the early
identification of probable default cases ensures that measures can be taken proactively.

The Bank's early warning alert system means that the quality of a risk can be assessed in an integrated
way and ensures a timely referral of the risk to recovery specialists, who determine the most
appropriate approach. When risks exceed a certain limit or loss ratio, groups or categories are
established to address them.

These alerts are managed jointly by the relationship manager and the risk analyst, helped by the
feedback obtained as a result of direct contact with the customer.

Risk management models

Credit rating

Credit risk exposures to corporate customers, real estate developers, specialized financing projects,
retailers and sole proprietors, financial institutions and countries are assessed according to a system of
credit ratings based on predictive factors and internal estimates of the probability of default.

The rating model is reviewed each year on the basis of an analysis of actual default data. Each internal
rating score is assigned an anticipated default rate which allows consistent comparisons to be made

across segments and with the ratings produced by independent rating agencies, according to a master
scale.

Scoring
Credit risk exposures to individual customers are classified by means of scoring systems which make

use of quantitative modelling based on historical data to identify key predictive factors. Two types of
scoring are used:

240


--- Page 48 ---

Behavioural scoring: The system in which all customers are automatically classified according to their
transaction histories and data for each product acquired. It is used primarily for such purposes as
granting loans, setting overdraft limits, targeting sales campaigns, and for tracking and segmenting in
claim and/or recovery procedures.

Reactive scoring: This is used to evaluate applications for personal loans, mortgage loans and credit
cards. When full details of the application have been entered, the system generates a result based on
the estimated borrowing capacity and financial position of the applicant and the quality of any security
or collateral.

Early alert tool

For both Companies and Individuals, Banco Sabadell has a system of early alerts which, based on
available information sources (rating or scoring, customer file, balance sheets, the Bank of Spain's
CIRBE risk information system, industry information, transaction data, etc.), models the customer's
short-term risk (anticipating delinquency) and achieves a high level of predictability in detecting
potential non-performing exposures. The score, which is produced automatically, is included in the
monitoring process as one of the basic inputs in tracking the risk posed by individuals and companies.

This alert system allows for

e Improvements in efficiency by focusing attention on customers with lower credit scores (different
groups are assigned different thresholds).

e Early action in view of a customer's worsening situation (change of score, new serious alerts, etc.).

e Periodic oversight of customers who remain in the same situation and have been analysed by the
Basic Management Team.

241


--- Page 49 ---

Non-performing risks
Banco Sabadell has an advanced non-performing risk management model for impaired asset portfolios.

The objective of managing non-performing exposures is to find the best solution for the customer at the
first sign of impairment so as to reduce the number of customers in difficulties who enter default. This
should be done through intensive management with no dead times between the various phases of the
process.

Country risk

This is the risk of incurring loss from exposures to sovereign borrowers or to persons domiciled in a
particular country for reasons connected with national sovereignty or the economic situation of the
country, i.e. for reasons other than the usual commercial risk. Country risk includes sovereign risk,
transfer risk and other risks inherent in global financial operations (war, expropriation, nationalization,
etc.).

An overall exposure limit is set for each country and this applies across the whole Banco Sabadell
group. These limits are approved by the Executive Committee and the corresponding decision-making
organ, depending on the level of delegation, and are constantly monitored to ensure that any
deterioration in the political, economic or social situation in a country can be detected in good time.

A range of different tools and indicators are used to manage country risk. credit ratings, CDS,
macroeconomic indicators, etc.

Counterparty risk

The counterparty risk management philosophy is aligned with the business strategy, which pursues
value creation through the efficient use of capital allocated to the business units. Strict criteria have
been established for managing counterparty risk deriving from the financial markets, to guarantee the
integrity of Banco Sabadell Group's capital.

Banco Sabadell has a system for evaluating and managing those risks, which allows it to monitor and
control compliance with approved limits on a daily basis.

Additionally, to mitigate exposure to counterparty risk, Banco Sabadell has Credit Support Annexes
(CSA) and Global Master Repurchase Agreements (GMRA) with most counterparties, which notably
reduces the risks incurred through the provision of collateral.

Concentration risk
Concentration risk refers to exposures that can potentially generate enough losses to threaten the
financial health of an institution or the viability of its ordinary business activity. This type of risk is

divided into two basic subtypes:

= Individual concentration risk: imperfect diversification of idiosyncratic risk in the portfolio, due
either to its small size or to very large exposures to specific customers.

= Sectorial concentration risk: imperfect diversification of systematic risk components in the
portfolio. Such concentrations may occur in particular sectors or geographical regions, for

example.

In order to ensure on efficient management of concentration risk, Banco Sabadell has a series of
specific tools and policies:

242


--- Page 50 ---

= Quantitative metrics in the Risk Appetite Statement and their subsequent monitoring as top-
level metrics

= Individual limits for risks and customers considered to be significant, which are established by
the Executive Committee

= A structure of delegation which require that relevant customer transactions be approved by the
Credit Operations Committee, or even by the Executive Committee

Greater information on credit risk, both qualitative and quantitative, can be found in the Notes to the
Accounts (especially Notes 8, 9, 18, and 37).

6.2.2. Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk can be defined as the possibility of losses being incurred as a result of the Bank’s being
unable, even if only temporarily, to attend payment commitments due to a lack of liquid assets, or of its
being unable to access the markets to refinance debts at a reasonable cost. This may be associated
with factors of a systemic nature or specific to the Bank itself.

Liquidity risk management is established around the basic requirement that the Group have, at all times,
enough liquidity to achieve with the levels established by regulation and by the Bank's internal risk
management policies.

As an additional policy, the Bank requires a reserve margin to cover liquidity needs arising from
maintaining liquid assets classified as eligible collateral by the European Central Bank that is sufficient
to fund debt issued on the capital markets that matures in the next 12 months.

A number of methodologies and information systems are used to evaluate this risk:
Information related to the daily balance of assets and liabilities and the financial market situation.

Information on liquid assets and second-line liquidity reserves based on assets eligible for discounting
with the ECB.

Liquidity gap using the tool's measurement framework to measure out interest rate risk, with the ability
to perform simulations.

Information on the maturities of funding obtained in the wholesale markets.
Periodic stress tests.

General market information: issues, spreads, external rating agency reports, etc.

The Bank periodically carries out a stress test exercise focused on its position in the institutional
market. The stress test measures the effects of a prolonged shutdown of the capital and interbank
markets combined with a one level fall in the Bank's credit rating and a flight of deposits held by
institutions and companies with professional treasury management functions. The result of this exercise
is to ensure that the Bank continues to hold a cushion of liquid assets sufficient to cover the net
balance of inflows and outflows in a stress situation lasting for up to a year.

In addition, the Bank carries out a further stress exercise which, unlike the one described above,
assumes the complete drawdown of all available funds from the Bank within a period of one month, the
withdrawal of 7.5% of its retail customer deposit base (households and SMEs) and of 15% of its
corporate and public sector deposit base within one month, and the non-renewal of all securities sold to
retail customers.

The Bank also analyses the robustness of its holdings of liquid assets such as ECB-discountable assets
by conducting a study of the sensitivity of its eligible asset base to different scenarios combining credit
rating downgrades and impacts on the market prices of the assets. The purpose of this exercise is to
establish that the Bank's eligible asset base is sufficiently robust to ensure that it is holding available

243


--- Page 51 ---

eligible assets that are sufficient in terms of its current position vis-a-vis the ECB.

As part of its stress test exercises, each month Banco Sabadell draws up a contingency plan for
responding to two different stress liquidity situations: a systemic crisis and a crisis specifically affecting
Banco Sabadell. The contingency plan examines the Group's ability to issue securities on the capital
market under each of the scenarios and all balance sheet assets that would be capable of generating
liquidity. It determines, for each asset class and under each crisis scenario, the proportion that could be
made liquid within one week and one month. This establishes the Group's contingent liquidity in a
liquidity crisis situation.

As regards the new Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), Banco
Sabadell is providing the Regulator with the information required under the EBA's new liquidity
templates on a monthly and quarterly basis, respectively. The Group amply exceeds the LCR
requirement. At the end of 2014, its LCR was over 100%, compared with the minimum requirement of
60% in 2015. The NSFR is still in the final phases of being analysed and defined. The NSFR is expected
to be implemented in January 2018, with a phase-in period, like the LCR.

6.2.3. Market risk

Market risk arises from possible fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial
instrument as a result of changes in market risk factors. Several types of market risk factors can be
distinguished, the main types being interest rate risk, exchange rate risk, stock price risk and credit
spread risk.

Different approaches are taken to manage this risk, depending on which of the Group's main business
lines has given rise to it:

Risk arising from proprietary trading as part of the strategy of focusing on customer business. Risk that
is primarily attributable to Treasury and Capital Market positions using currency instruments, equities
and fixed-income, in both the treasury and derivatives markets.

Risks arising from the Group's commercial banking with customers and its corporate banking
businesses, known as structural balance sheet risk. These risks can be sub-classified into interest rate
risk and currency risk.

The system for acceptance, management and control of market risk is based on establishing limits for
expressly assigned positions and approval of transactions for each business unit, with the result that
the various management units must always keep their positions within the established limits and obtain
approval for transactions from the risk management function.

Trading

The main indicator used to measure market risk is VaR (Value at Risk), which allows the risks on
different types of financial market transaction to be analysed as a single class. The VaR method
provides an estimate of the potential maximum loss on a position that would result from an adverse, but
possible, movement in any of the market risk factors. This estimate is expressed in money terms and is
calculated at a specified date, to a specified confidence level and over a specified time horizon. The
estimate takes account of the different levels of market risk factors (interest rate, currency rate,
equities and credit spread) to which the transaction is exposed.

Market risk is monitored on a daily basis and reports on current risk levels and on compliance with the
limits assigned to each unit are referred to the risk control functions. Limits are assigned by the Risk
Control Committee for each management unit (based on nominal values, VaR or sensitivity, as
applicable). This makes it possible to track changes in exposure levels and measure the contribution of
each risk factor.

Risk control of this kind is supplemented by special simulation exercises and extreme market scenarios
(stress testing), which provide the positions’ risk profile. However, the VaR methodology does not rule
out the possibility that losses will exceed the set limits, as significant market movements may occur
that exceed the confidence levels being applied. The reliability of the VaR methodology is validated by
back-testing techniques which are used to verify that VaR estimates are consistent with the specified
confidence level.

Structural interest and exchange rate risk
Structural interest rate risk:

Interest rate risk is caused by changes in interest rates or in the levels or slope of the yield curve to
which asset, liability and off-balance sheet positions are fixed. Gaps arise between these items because
of differences in repricing and maturity schedules may affect the robustness and stability of results.

The management of interest rate risk focuses on overall financial exposure for the Group as a whole and
involves proposing alternative commercial or hedging strategies that will meet business objectives and
are appropriate to market conditions within the exposure limits established for the Group. A number of
methodologies are used to measure interest rate risk. These include measuring the sensitivity of net
interest income to changes in interest rates over a one-year horizon. This is done by means of static
(gap analysis) and dynamic (simulation) techniques based, in the latter case, on different assumptions
of balance sheet growth and changes in the slope of the yield curve.

Another technique is to measure the sensitivity of equity to changes in interest rates using duration gap
analysis. This measures the effect of interest rate changes over a longer time horizon.

Structural exchange rate risk

Structural exchange rate risk arises as a result of changes in the exchange rates between different
currencies and the possibility that these movements may result in losses on financial investments and
on permanent investments in foreign branches and subsidiaries.

Exchange rate risk is monitored on a daily basis and reports on current risk levels and on compliance
with the limits assigned to each unit are sent to the decision-making authority.

6.2.4 Operational risk

Operational Risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes,
people, and systems or from unforeseen external events. This definition includes reputational risk (which
includes behavioural risk), technology risk and model risk.

Management of operational risk is decentralized and devolved to the people in charge of organization-
wide processes. All of those processes are identified on a corporate process map, thus facilitating the
compilation of information in a way that reflects the structure of the organization. The group has a
specialized central unit to manage operational risk, whose main functions are to coordinate, supervise
and promote the identification, assessment and management of risks by process managers in line with
Banco Sabadell's process-based approach.

Senior management and the Board of Directors play a direct, hands-on role in managing operational risk
by approving the risk management framework and its implementation as proposed by an Operational
Risk Committee, made up of senior managers from different functional areas of the company; they also
ensure that regular audits are carried out on the management strategy being applied, the reliability of
the information being reported, and the internal validation tests required by the operational risk model.
Management of operational risk is divided into two action areas:

245


--- Page 53 ---

The first action area is based on an analysis in which all processes and any associated risks that involve
potential losses are identified, leading to a qualitative evaluation of the risks and their associated
control mechanisms. This is done by process managers in conjunction with the central operational risk
unit. The result is an assessment that allows future exposures to be recognized as expected and
unexpected losses, tendencies to be anticipated and mitigating action to be taken.

This is supplemented by a system for identifying, monitoring and actively managing risk through the use
of key risk indicators. These can be used to trigger alerts in response to increases in exposure, identify
the causes of that exposure and measure the effectiveness of the controls put in place and of any
improvements made.

Care is taken to ensure that all processes identified as critical are protected by specific business
continuity plans for the event of a service failure. The operational risks identified are also assessed
qualitatively from the point of view of their reputational implications should the risk materialize.

The second action area is based on experience. It consists of maintaining a database of all losses that
occur in the organization, which provides a store of information of actual operational risk events for each
business line and the causes of those events, so that risks can be acted upon and their causes
minimized.

This loss information is also of use in measuring the extent to which estimates of potential loss are
consistent with reality, in terms of both severity and frequency, so that loss exposure estimates are
constantly being updated and improved in this way.

The database contains historical records of actual losses resulting from operational risk going back to
2002. It is constantly being updated as information is received on losses and recoveries, whether
resulting from the Bank's own efforts or from insurance provision.

Operational risk includes management and control of the following main risks:

= Reputational risk: the possibility of losses arising from negative publicity related to the Bank's
practices and activities, potentially leading to a loss of trust in the institution, with an impact on
its solvency.

= Technology risk: possibility of losses due to the inability of the systems infrastructure to fully
support the continuation of ordinary business activity.

= Model risk: possibility of losses due to decision-making based on the use of inadequate models.

6.2.5 Tax risk

Tax risk reflects the possibility of a breach, or of uncertainty over the interpretation, of tax legislation in
any of the jurisdictions where the Bank operates.

Banco Sabadell Group's objective in this area is to ensure compliance with tax obligations while
guaranteeing adequate returns for our shareholders.

The Board of Directors determines the tax risk control and management policies, as well as the tax
strategy, with the double objective of ensuring that legal obligations are met and ensuring greater
returns for shareholders.

The Tax Advisory Area provides an independent review of the Bank's operations to ensure that they
conform to the tax legislation in force. Its functions can be divided into two areas, depending on Banco
Sabadell's purpose in each case:

e As a taxpayer: with a view to ensuring that Banco Sabadell meets its tax obligations accurately
and on time, the Tax Advisory Area performs regular checks that the Bank's general situation

246


--- Page 54 ---

complies with the tax legislation, and sporadic checks, as required, that specific operations are
compliant.

e Asa developer of new products: the Bank's ordinary activity involves creating new products to be
offered to our customers. The development of these products must include an analysis of their tax
situation with a view to describing their characteristics in a transparent way.

6.2.6 Compliance risk

Compliance risk is defined as the risk of incurring legal or administrative penalties, significant financial
loss or an impairment of reputation due to a breach of laws, regulations, internal rules and codes of
conduct applicable to the banking industry.

One of the essential aspects of Banco Sabadell Group policy, and the basis of its organizational culture,
is rigorous compliance with all legal provisions. The pursuit of our business objectives must be
compliant at all times with the current legislation and with best practice.

The Group has a Compliance Department with the mission to promote and attain the highest levels of
compliance with regulations and ethical standards within the Group, manage compliance risk so as to
minimize the possibility of non-compliance, and ensure that any non-compliance that occurs is identified,
reported and resolved diligently and that appropriate preventive measures are implemented, where they
do not already exist.

The compliance model centralizes the definition of policies, procedures and controls on the parent
company, together with the execution of Banco Sabadell control programmes, and decentralizes the
execution of programmes to subsidiaries and branches outside Spain, while maintaining functional
responsibility.

It is a flexible risk-focused model which can be adapted to the Group's strategy at all times and
leverages synergies, maintaining an overall approach to those aspects that are general in scope and/or
which require major technological developments, but also adapting to the specific features and
legislation affecting each business or country.

The main challenge is standardizing the levels of compliance oversight across the Group and
establishing minimum standards for mandatory compliance, regardless of the activity or country.

This model is based on two pillars:

(i) A central unit which serves the entire Group and is focused on overall management of Compliance
Risk. Its main activity is the analysis, distribution and oversight of the implementation of all new
regulations with an impact on the Group, as well as risk-focused control of proper compliance with pre-
existing regulations.

It is directly responsible for executing processes considered to be high risk as they require direct,
comprehensive oversight: prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing; controlling market
abuse; controlling compliance with internal codes of conduct; and monitoring investor protection
(MiFID).

(ii) A network of compliance officers in each subsidiary and foreign branch (functionally dependent on
the Central Compliance Unit and hierarchically dependent on the head of the subsidiary/foreign branch)
who execute their own control programmes and report periodically to the Central Unit, ensuring
compliance with the internal rules and the legislation in force in all countries and activities in which the
Group operates.

For greater efficiency, this model is implemented and enhanced through six catalysts (technology,
training, procedures, communication channels, control and monitoring programmes, and a process for
approving products and rules).

7 — POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS

Since 31 December 2014, there have been no significant events worthy of mention.

8- EXPECTED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

Banco Sabadell adopts three-year strategic plans designed in accordance with macroeconomic and
regulatory conditions. The success it has had in implementing each of its previous strategic plans
allowed Banco Sabadell to be ready for the new one and to have a high level of confidence in its
successful outcome.

The “Optima 2010” plan had the aim of preparing the Bank to become an efficient platform for growth.
Once that had been achieved, the CREA plan focused on organic and inorganic growth, which enabled
the Bank to reach critical mass so as to compete effectively in the Spanish financial system while the
whole sector was undergoing a process of concentration.

During the implementation phase of the “CREA” plan, Banco Sabadell was able to transform itself
commercially, growing its customer base by a factor of three, increasing market shares and optimizing
its resources.

In the current macroeconomic context, having completed the restructuring and integration of Banco
CAM and several acquisitions in 2013 in order to continue strengthening its franchise, Banco Sabadell
started a new business plan that aims to extract value from the customer base by leveraging its new
size and margin-generating capability. The main goal of the 2014-2016 Triple Plan is profitability. Key
themes of the new plan are transformation (transformation of the business, transformation of the
production process and transformation of the balance sheet) and internationalization (laying the
foundations for becoming more international in terms of structure, resources, etc. and entering new
markets).

The Triple plan proposes a series of financial objectives for the medium term. These include (i) bringing
the cost/income or efficiency ratio (personnel and other administrative expenses as a proportion of
gross income) down to 40%; (ii) a double digit return on capital (consolidated profit attributable to the
Bank divided by average monthly own funds over the 3-year period); (iii) a loan-to-deposit ratio of over
100%; and, finally (iv) a core Tier 1 ratio of more than 10% (with full application of the standards laid
down in the Basel III accords and CRD IV/CRR IV).

The Group met the intermediate objectives set in the Triple plan for the first year, and is therefore on
track to achieve the plan's goals.

9 -RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION

The Bank completed the integration of Banco Gallego and Lloyds Bank International in 2014, a process
which began at the end of 2013.

Meanwhile, a Systems Plan was being put into effect that was more intensive than the previous year’s
plan and was aligned with the key aims of the 2014-2016 Triple Business Plan.

Initiatives were launched to strengthen multi-channel commercial management and marketing
campaigns by implementing new tools. Projects for further improvements to branch operations and
performance continued to be put in place, with initiatives such as the implementation of biometric
signature input and a multi-channel document signing system. A document scanner and manager has
been incorporated into the new Proteo front-end application, and the previous distributed OCR system
has been replaced by a centralized OCR system that can be used from any kind of front-end application,
including mobile devices.

As regards corporate mobility, the first functional versions of Proteo Mobile (the front-end application for
mobile devices) have been developed.

248

In the field of active risk management, further work was done to develop the risk model for individual
customers, and work on process automation continued.

In the Treasury, Markets and Asset Management area, efforts were made in 2014 to adapt the systems
to handle negative rates and to implement a new customer risk control system for Treasury operations
involving foreign exchange (TGR).

As regards Corporate Administration Systems, the main actions in the year were focused on improving
processes to comply with new regulatory requirements (e.g. those related to the new CIRBE 2

statements). In the area of human resources, the Bank began implementing solutions for internal talent
management.

The Bank’s share price appreciated by 16.3% in 2014, the IBEX-35 by 3.66% and the average for all
listed banks by 6.27%.

b) Dividend policy

Historically the Bank had applied a dividend policy in which the payout was in the region of 50% of the
profit for the year. On some occasions in the last few years, the distribution of profit in the form of a
dividend has been supplemented by a distribution out of the share premium account.

In recent years, given the sector's need to strengthen its capital, the Supervisor recommended that
credit institutions limit cash dividend payments to 25% of 2013 attributable profit. The Bank has a

249


--- Page 57 ---

comfortable level of capital, as can be seen in the results of the ECB’s comprehensive assessment in
2014. In view of this, and as the above-mentioned circumstances return to normal, the Bank can resume
its previous policy of distributing approximately 50% of its profit.

c) Managing the credit rating

Banco Sabadell’s credit rating and actions by credit rating agencies during the year:

In 2014, the three agencies rating Banco Sabadell’s credit quality were Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and
DBRS. The current ratings, and the last dates on which they were affirmed, are as follows:

Long term Short term Outlook Last review
Standard & Poor's BB+ B Negative 27/11/2014
Moody's Ba2 NP Negative 23/10/2014
DBRS A (low) R1 (low) Negative 09/01/2015

After Moody’s downgraded the ratings of a number of Spanish banks in the second half of 2013, and as
a result of its review of Banco Sabadell that commenced in July 2013, on 14 January 2014 the agency
downgraded Banco Sabadell’s long-term rating by one notch to Ba2 (from Ba1), with a negative outlook.
In spite of the downgrade, Moody’s did acknowledge Banco Sabadell’s “recurring earnings power”,
which it said “compared favourably with those of its domestic peers”.

On 27 November 2014, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services upgraded Banco Sabadell’s long-term rating
by one notch to BB+ (from BB), and affirmed its short-term rating at B. The negative outlook reflects the
possible reduction in government support for European banks when the bank resolution framework is
introduced. The rating upgrade was based on the agency’s view that Banco Sabadell’s credit quality has
improved in the context of lower economic risk for the Spanish banking system, which S&P expect will
continue to increase capital ratios as a result of the steady improvement in returns in the banking
business.

On 18 December 2014, DBRS upgraded Banco Sabadell’s mortgage covered bonds by two notches to
AA (low), from A. This rating action was the result of implementing DBRS’s new methodology, Rating
European Covered Bonds, and of the Bank’s high level of overcollateralization, its capacity to generate
sufficient payment flows for the mortgage covered bonds, and higher recovery prospects.

All the agencies highlighted the improvement in Banco Sabadell’s capital position and took a positive
view of the stress test results.

In the course of 2014, Banco Sabadell held meetings with the three agencies. Among the topics

discussed at the meetings and in conference calls were the Bank’s strategy, stress tests, profit
performance, capital, liquidity, risk and credit quality, as well as its management of troubled assets.

d) Branch network

At the end of 2014, Banco Sabadell was operating 2,320 branches, 98 less than at the end of 2013,
due to the optimization of the branch network following the integration of BMN-Penedés, Banco Gallego
and Lloyds Bank.

Of the total number of Banco Sabadell group branches and offices, 1,204 were operating under the
SabadellAtlantico brand (including 36 specialist business banking and 2 specialist corporate banking
branches); 503 were operating as SabadellCAM (including 11 business banking branches); 178 formed
the Banco Herrero network in Asturias and Leon (including 5 business banking branches); 131 were
under the SabadellGuipuzcoano brand (including 5 business banking branches); 12 were operating under
the SabadellUrquijo name; 108 were Solbank branches, and the remaining 53 made up the Group’s
international network, including the 27 operated by Sabadell United Bank and 7 by BancSabadell
d'Andorra. Additionally, ActivoBank has two customer service centres. The distribution of the Group's
Spanish branches by region was as follows:
