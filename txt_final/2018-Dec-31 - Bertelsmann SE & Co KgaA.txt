Combined Management Report

Financial Year 2018 in Review

Bertelsmann can look back on a successful year in 2018. Group revenues rose by 2.8 percent

to €177 billion (previous year: €172 billion). Organic growth increased to 2.7 percent (previous

year: 1.7 percent) due

o growth at RTL Group, Penguin Random House, BMG, Arvato and the

Bertelsmann Education Group. The revenue share generated by the strategic growth businesses

increased to 34 percent (previous year: 32 percent). At €2,586 million, operating EBITDA

was once again at a high level. Operating EBITDA in the previous year was €2,636 million

and included substantial capital gains from real estate transactions. Earnings growth at

Penguin Random House, BMG, Arvato and the Bertelsmann Education Group was offset by

declining earnings at Bertelsmann Printing Group in particular. The EBITDA margin went down

from 15.3 percent in the previous year to 14.6 percent. Group profit was once again high, at

€1,104 million, compared with €1,198 million in the same period in the previous year. For 2019,

Bertelsmann again expects positive business performance.

Fundamental Information about the Group

In this Management Report, the Group is using the option
to combine the Group Management Report and the
Management Report of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. This
Combined Management Report outlines the business perfor-
mance, including the business result and the position of the
Bertelsmann Group and Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. Infor-
mation about Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA in accordance
with the German Commercial Code (HGB) will be detailed in a
separate section. The Combined Management Report will be
published instead of the Group Management Report within
the Bertelsmann Annual Report.

Corporate Profile

Bertelsmann operates in the core business fields of media,
services and education in around 50 countries worldwide.
The geographic core markets are Western Europe — in
particular, Germany, France and the United Kingdom — and
the United States. In addition, Bertelsmann is strengthening
its involvement in growth markets such as Brazil, India and
China. The Bertelsmann divisions are RTL Group (television),
Penguin Random House (books), Gruner + Jahr (magazines),
BMG (music), Arvato (services), Bertelsmann Printing Group
(printing), Bertelsmann Education Group (education) and
Bertelsmann Investments (funds).

Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is a publicly traded but unlisted
partnership limited by shares. As a Group holding company, it
exercises central corporate functions such as the specification
and development of the Group's strategy, capital allocation,
financing and management development. Internal corporate
management and reporting follow the Group's organizational
structure, which consists of the operating divisions and
Corporate.

RTL Group is, based on revenue, one of the leading television
groups in the broadcasting, content and digital business
with interests in 60 television channels, eight video-on-
demand platforms, 30 radio stations and content production
throughout the world. The television portfolio includes RTL
Television in Germany, M6 in France and the RTL channels
in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Croatia and
Hungary, as well as a stake in Atresmedia in Spain. Fremantle,
the production unit of RTL Group, is one of the largest
international creators, producers and distributors of a wide
range of formats outside the United States. RTL Group is
active in the area of online video with the on-demand services
of its broadcasters; the multiplatform networks BroadbandTV,
StyleHaul, Divimove and United Screens; and Fremantle’s

over 300 YouTube channels. Furthermore, RTL Group owns
SpotX, a programmatic video advertising platform. The
publicly traded RTL Group S.A. is listed on the German MDAX
index.

Penguin Random House is, based on revenue, the world’s larg-
est trade book publisher, with nearly 275 imprints across six
continents. Its well-known book brands include Doubleday,
Viking and Alfred A. Knopf (United States); Ebury, Hamish
Hamilton and Jonathan Cape (United Kingdom); Plaza & Janés
and Alfaguara (Spain); Sudamericana (Argentina); and the inter-
national imprint DK. Germany's Verlagsgruppe Random House,
which includes illustrious publishing houses such as Goldmann
and Heyne, is not part of Penguin Random House from a legal
point of view, but is under the same corporate management
and is part of the Penguin Random House division. Each year
Penguin Random House publishes about 15,000 new titles and
sells around 600 million print books, e-books and audiobooks.

Gruner + Jahr is one of Europe’s leading premium maga-
zine publishers. Its magazine portfolio includes established
brands such as “Stern,” “Brigitte” and “Geo”; young brands
like “Barbara,” “Guido” and “Chefkoch”; and the French maga-
zine publisher Prisma Media. It also has products and licenses
such as the “Schoner Wohnen” furniture collection and digital
offerings in all publishing segments. In digital marketing G+J
operates international platforms such as AppLike. Territory,
Germany's largest communication agency for brand content,
is also part of G+J. In addition, G+J holds majority stakes in
Motor Presse Stuttgart and in DDV Mediengruppe in Saxony,
and holds a stake in Spiegel-Gruppe.

BMG is an international music company with 15 offices in
12 music markets, now representing more than three mil-
lion songs and recordings, including the catalogs of Alberts
Music, Broken Bow Music Group, Bug, Cherry Lane,
Chrysalis, Mute, Primary Wave, Sanctuary and Trojan,
among others.

Arvato develops and implements innovative solutions for
customers in a wide range of sectors in over 40 countries for
all kinds of business processes. These comprise Customer
Relationship Management (CRM), Supply Chain Management
(SCM), Financial Solutions and IT Services.

The Bertelsmann Printing Group unites Bertelsmann’s printing
activities. This includes German offset printing companies
such as Mohn Media, the Prinovis gravure printing operations
in Germany and the United Kingdom, and the offset and
digital printing plants in the United States. In addition,
various digital marketing services are offered, with a focus on

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2018 5


--- Page 3 ---

data-driven multichannel marketing, campaign management
and customer loyalty. The Bertelsmann Printing Group also
includes the storage media producer Sonopress.

Bertelsmann Education Group comprises Bertelsmann’s edu-
cation activities. The digital education and service offerings
are primarily in the healthcare and technology sectors, as well
as in the university education area. The education activities
include the online education providers Relias and Udacity, as
well as the US university services provider HotChalk.

Bertelsmann Investments bundles Bertelsmann’s global
start-up investments. The activities are focused on the stra-
tegic growth markets of Brazil, China, India and the United
States. Investments are made through the funds Bertelsmann
Brazil Investments (BBI), Bertelsmann Asia Investments (BAI),
Bertelsmann India Investments (BII) and Bertelsmann Digital
Media Investments (BDMI).

Regulatory Environment

Bertelsmann has television and radio operations in several
European countries that are subject to regulation. In Germany,
for example, the media is subject to oversight by the Com-
mission on Concentration in the Media. Bertelsmann Group
companies occupy leading market positions in many lines of
business and may therefore have limited potential for growth
through acquisition due to antitrust legislation. Moreover,
some education activities are subject to regulatory provisions
of government authorities and accreditation bodies.

Because its profit participation certificates and bonds are
publicly listed, Bertelsmann is required to comply with capital
market regulations applicable to publicly traded companies.

Shareholder Structure

Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is an unlisted partnership limited
by shares. Three foundations (Bertelsmann Stiftung, Reinhard
Mohn Stiftung and BVG-Stiftung) indirectly hold 80.9 percent
of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA shares, with the remaining
19.1 percent held indirectly by the Mohn family. Bertelsmann
Verwaltungsgesellschaft (BVG) controls all voting rights at
the General Meeting of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and
Bertelsmann Management SE (general partner).

Strategy

Bertelsmann aims to achieve a faster-growing, more digi-
tal, more international and more diversified Group portfolio.

6 Financial Information Combined Management Report

Businesses in which Bertelsmann invests should have long-
term stable growth, global reach, sustainable business
models, high market-entry barriers and scalability. The rapidly
expanding education business is being developed into the
third earnings pillar alongside the media and service busi-
nesses. The Group strategy comprises four strategic priorities:
strengthening the core businesses, driving the digital transfor-
mation forward, developing growth platforms and expanding
into growth regions. In the financial year 2018, steady efforts
continued to focus on implementing the strategy in line with
these priorities.

As part of strengthening core businesses, RTL Group invested
in local and exclusive content that enhances both linear
and non-linear services, and intensified its focus on own
productions. “Becoming” by Michelle Obama was the most
important publication of the year for Penguin Random House,
published simultaneously in all of its markets. With new
magazines such as “Guido,” “JWD"” and “Dr. v. Hirschhausen’s
Stern Gesund Leben,” Gruner + Jahr continued to build
media products around famous personalities. In the reporting
period, Gruner + Jahr completed its focus on the core
markets of Germany and France. The successful merging
as of 2019 of CRM activities at Bertelsmann and the Saham
Group continues the strategic development of Arvato’s CRM
businesses. The new Group Majorel will push the continued
expansion of the global presence and digital transformation of
the service portfolio in coming years.

As part of the digital transformation, RTL Group expanded its
video-on-demand offerings, for example with the relaunch
of TV Now in Germany, and merged the online advertis-
ing marketers SpotX and SmartClip. In France, Groupe M6,
together with partners, plans to create a joint online video
platform, which aims to provide French television pro-
gramming of all formats and all genres, live or on demand.
Germany's Verlagsgruppe Random House acquired the
audiobook publisher DAV, thereby strengthening its offer-
ings in the growing audiobook market. Gruner + Jahr con-
tinued to expand the app discovery platform AppLike, and
Arvato grew its service business with customers from the
IT and tech industries.

In the area of growth platforms, the RTL Group production
unit Fremantle profited from the return of “American Idol,”
and produced new series such as “My Brilliant Friend” and
“Deutschland 86.” BMG’s acquisitions included the world
music label World Circuit Records, and BMG signed a global
publishing agreement with former Beatles drummer Ringo
Starr. Arvato continued to organically expand its logistics
and financial services activities. In addition, Arvato invested
in the Israeli fintech start-up Secured Touch. The education


--- Page 4 ---

business bundled in the Bertelsmann Education Group was
further strengthened by the acquisition of the US online
education provider OnCourse Learning. The company pro-
vides digital corporate and advanced training courses, par-
ticularly to clients in the healthcare sector. The Bertelsmann
Education Group also acquired a majority stake in the US
university services provider HotChalk.

In the growth regions, Bertelsmann further expanded its
global network of investments in digital companies, making
multiple new and follow-on investments worldwide through
the funds grouped under Bertelsmann Investments. For
example, Bertelsmann Asia Investments (BAI) invested in
the Chinese music streaming platform NetEase Cloud Music
and increased its investments in the financial service provider
Linklogis and the e-commerce platform Club Factory. At the
same time, BAI successfully divested a number of stakes,
including shares in the dating app Tantan. Bertelsmann
Brazil Investments (BBI) successfully acquired a majority
stake in Afferolab, a corporate training service provider in
Brazil. In addition, Penguin Random House announced the
increase of its stake in the Brazilian publisher Companhia
das Letras. In India, Bertelsmann India Investments (BII)
invested in the direct-to-consumer food platform Licious
and increased its investment in the social media portal
Roposo. Furthermore, Penguin Random House expanded
its local offerings in India by acquiring the publisher Hind
Pocket Books.

Bertelsmann will continue to push ahead with its ongoing
transformation in 2019 in line with the four strategic
priorities. Compliance with and achievement of the strategic
development priorities are continuously examined by the
Executive Board at the divisional level through regular
meetings of the Strategy and Business Committee and as
part of the annual Strategic Planning Dialogue between the
Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. In addition,
relevant markets and the competitive environment are
analyzed on an ongoing basis in order to draw conclusions
concerning the further development of the Group’s strategy.
The Executive Board is also supported by the Group
Management Committee (GMC) on issues of corporate
strategy and development. This Committee is composed
of executives representing key businesses, countries and
regions and select Group-wide functions.

The Group's content-based and entrepreneurial creativity is
also very important for the implementation of its strategy.
Bertelsmann will therefore continue to invest in the creative
core of its businesses. Simultaneously, innovation compe-
tence is very important for Bertelsmann and is a key strategic
component (see the section “Innovations”).

Value-Oriented Management System

Bertelsmann’'s primary objective is continuous growth of the
company’s value through a sustained increase in profitability
with efficient capital investment at the same time. To manage
the Group, Bertelsmann has been using a value-oriented
management system for many years, which focuses on
revenues, operating earnings and optimal capital investment.
For formal reasons, Bertelsmann makes a distinction between
strictly defined and broadly defined operational performance
indicators.

Strictly defined operational performance indicators, includ-
ing revenues, operating EBITDA and Bertelsmann Value
Added (BVA), are used to directly assess current business
performance and are correspondingly used in the outlook.
These are distinguished from performance indicators used in
the broader sense, which are partially derived from the above-
mentioned indicators or are strongly influenced by these.
These include the EBITDA margin and the cash conversion
rate. The financial management system, with defined internal
financing targets, is also part of the broadly defined value-
oriented management system. Details of the expected devel-
opment of performance indicators used in the broader sense
are provided as additional information and are not included in
the outlook.

To explain the business performance and to control and man-
age the Group, Bertelsmann also uses alternative performance
measures that are not defined in accordance with IFRS (more
details are given in the section “Alternative Performance
Measures”).

Strictly Defined Operational Performance Indicators

To control and manage the Group, Bertelsmann uses
revenues, operating EBITDA and BVA as performance indica-
tors. Revenue is used as a growth indicator of businesses.
Group revenues in the financial year 2018 rose by 2.8 percent
to €17.7 billion (previous year: €17.2 billion). The organic
growth was 2.7 percent.

A key performance indicator for measuring the profitability
of the Bertelsmann Group and the divisions is the operat-
ing EBITDA. Operating EBITDA increased to €2,586 million
(previous year: €2,636 million) in the reporting period.

Bertelsmann uses BVA for assessing the profitability of opera-
tions and return on invested capital. BVA measures the profit
realized above and beyond the appropriate return on invested
capital. At €121 million, BVA in the financial year 2018 was
below the previous year's figure of €163 million. This trend

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2018 7


--- Page 5 ---

was caused by a lower operating result and the impact of
above-average invested capital.

Broadly Defined Performance Indicators

To assess business development, other performance indi-
cators are used that are partially derived from revenues
and operating EBITDA or are strongly influenced by these
figures.

The cash conversion rate serves as a measure of cash gen-
erated from business activities, which should be between
90 percent and 100 percent as a long-term average. In the
financial year 2018, the Cash Conversion Rate was 91 percent
(previous year: 92 percent).

The EBITDA margin is used as an additional criterion for
assessing business performance. In the financial year 2018,
the EBITDA margin of 14.6 percent was below the previous
year's level of 15.3 percent.

Bertelsmann’s financial management and controlling system
is defined by the internal financial targets outlined in the sec-
tion “Net Assets and Financial Position.” These financing
principles are pursued in the management of the Group and
are included in the broadly defined value-oriented manage-
ment system.

The non-financial performance indicators (employees, cor-
porate responsibility and similar topics) are not included in
the broadly defined value-oriented management system. As
they can only be measured to a limited extent, it is not pos-
sible to make any clear quantifiable statements concerning
interrelated effects and value increases. For this reason, the
non-financial performance indicators are not used for the
management of the Group.

Non-Financial Performance Indicators

The following section describes the non-financial perfor-
mance indicators at Bertelsmann. For more information about
the organization, management and key topics of corporate
responsibility, please refer to page 40 et seq. of the section
“Combined Non-Financial Statement.”

Employees

At the end of the financial year 2018, the Group had
117,220 employees worldwide. In 2018, there were

8 Financial Information Combined Management Report

1,279 people serving in trainee positions in Bertelsmann
companies in Germany.

The purpose of the human resources (HR) strategy is to support
the implementation of the Group's strategy. In 2018, the main
focus was again on the further development and training of
employees. This included a comprehensive adaptation of the
central talent management processes and tools, including the
expansion of talent pools and digital learning.

Continuous employee training is the basis of a company’s
future economic success. In view of this, the training courses
offered by Bertelsmann University have been further digi-
tized and expanded. Furthermore, at the end of 2018, over
92,000 employees in 48 countries were able to access training
courses on the Group-wide digital “peoplenet” HR IT platform.

Supporting dialogue between the employee representa-
tives and dialogue with Bertelsmann management is also
very important. At the Group Dialogue Conference in
December 2018, future work developments were discussed.
In addition, together with the disabled persons councils, an
Inclusion Action Plan was prepared to improve participation of
disabled persons in the working environment, and is slated
to be adopted in 2019.

Continuing to develop the corporate culture is another priority
of the HR strategy. In 2018, the Group continued to revise the
Bertelsmann Essentials (company values) in accordance with
the Sense of Purpose.

Bertelsmann has been one of the pioneers in profit sharing
since 1970. Accordingly, in 2018, a total of €105 million of the
2017 profit was distributed to employees across the Group
(previous year: €105 million).

Corporate Responsibility

The aim of corporate responsibility (CR) at Bertelsmann is to
bring the economic interests in line with the Group's social
and ecological concerns as part of a dialogue with all relevant
stakeholders.

In view of this, the Bertelsmann CR Council continued its cross-
divisional dialogue and the strategic further development of
significant Group-wide CR topics in 2018. The focus was on
topics of particular relevance relating to employee and social
concerns, respect for human rights, the fight against corrup-
tion and bribery, and environmental concerns. Bertelsmann
made donations and was involved in funding initiatives in the
areas of education, culture, science and creativity.

Innovations

Businesses invest in the research and development of new
products in order to ensure their long-term competitiveness.
The media sector has a similar imperative to create innovative
media content and media-related products and services in a
rapidly changing environment. This means that instead of con-
ventional research and development activities, Bertelsmann
views the company’s own innovative power as particularly
important for business development. The long-term success
of the Group depends heavily on product innovations, invest-
ing in growth markets and integrating new technologies.
Furthermore, innovative expertise is very important for strat-
egy implementation.

Bertelsmann relies on innovation and growth in core opera-
tions and new business fields. The key success factors of
Bertelsmann’s innovation management include continu-
ously following cross-industry trends and observing new
markets. At the Group level, Bertelsmann works with the
divisions to continuously identify and implement innova-
tive business strategies. Alongside market-oriented activi-
ties, support is given to Group-wide initiatives that actively
promote knowledge transfer and collaboration. At regular
innovation forums, executives meet with internal and exter-
nal experts to examine success factors for innovation and
creativity. Furthermore, cooperation is strengthened with
increased collaboration among the divisions. The marketer
IP Deutschland and G+J eMS have combined their capabili-
ties into the “Ad Alliance” and have been providing them to
advertising clients and media agencies since 2017. In addi-
tion, on February 1, 2019, Bertelsmann launched the new
“Bertelsmann Content Alliance” in Germany, a cooperation
between all content businesses in the Group for developing
and marketing mutual formats across divisions.

The innovations at RTL Group focus on three core topics:
continuously developing new, high-quality TV formats; using
all digital means of distribution; and expanding diverse forms
of advertising sales and monetization. RTL Group's “New
Frontiers” transformation process introduced in 2018 is
aimed at fostering organic growth, thereby fostering creativ-
ity and innovative strength. Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland
relaunched its video-on-demand platform TV Now in 2018.
This relaunch comprises a new platform and additional
exclusive content, such as Online First formats. One example
of a fictional “TV Now Original” is “M — Eine Stadt sucht
einen Morder” (“M — A City Hunts a Murderer”). Further-
more, RTL Group established the “Creative Reality Fund,” an
innovation competition within the company for tapping addi-
tional potential in virtual and augmented reality technologies

for its own media services. Synergy committees are used
for regularly exchanging information and knowledge within
RTL Group.

Innovation at Penguin Random House is intended on the one
hand to extend the reach of its books and create a relationship
with readers at scale, and on the other hand, to utilize mod-
ern technologies and introduce new formats. One example
of innovative reader involvement is the partnership between
Penguin Random House and Inception, a virtual reality and
augmented reality (AR) specialist. As part of this partnership,
the Bookful app was developed for accessing classic chil-
dren's books and nonfiction for young readers and bringing
illustrations to life for selected titles with the assistance of AR
technologies. Young readers can interact with the figures in a
story, and in so doing, intensify their learning and comprehen-
sion. Penguin Random House also launched a voice skill called
Good Vibes, which Amazon Alexa builds on with inspirational
short excerpts from popular books and quotes from best-
selling authors. The company is also targeting new audiences
in other innovative ways, such as the “Penguin Minis” series
format — pocket-sized, full-length books that can easily fit in
the palm of a hand — introduced to the American market with
titles by bestselling author John Green.

The innovations at Gruner + Jahr included developing new
magazines and expanding the brand business. Positive busi-
ness performance of the marketing platform AppLike and
increased digital offerings of the classic magazine brands of
Prisma Media contributed to additional growth in the digital
business. G+J also launched innovative magazines. In addi-
tion to the gourmet magazine “B-Eat,” G+J created the per-
sonality magazine genre with “Boa,” “Guido,” “JWD" and
“Dr. v. Hirschhausen’s Stern Gesund Leben.” G+J further
expanded its brands with the opening of the first “Beef!”
restaurant, the expansion of the “Schdéner Wohnen” licens-
ing business and further development of “Eat the World,” a
culinary-cultural city tour operator.

Innovation at BMG is based on the company’s five strategic
pillars: focusing on growth markets; expanding and diversifying
its repertoire; expanding global presence; and relentlessly
delivering on its core values of fairness, transparency and
service while retaining its competitive approach to costs. A
key innovation in 2018 was the expansion of the royalties
app myBMG, which is now available not only to songwriters
but also to artists represented by BMG. Further innovations
included the historic blues project “Confessin’ The Blues”
created together with the Rolling Stones, the 50-year
anniversary celebration for Trojan Records and the Joan Jett
documentary “Bad Reputation.”

All four business areas at Arvato introduced innovations, with
a strong focus on the use of innovative technologies and on
design, as well as creating new services or enhancing exist-
ing solutions. Among others, analytics, machine learning and
chatbots were used to continue automation of customer com-
munication processes and to optimize end-customer service.
Its acquisition of 3C Deutschland GmbH has enabled Arvato
Financial Solutions to offer a fully automated and digitalized
claims management process for car insurance. Solution Group
SCM Solutions has continued to develop business intelligence
solutions along the supply chain, and Arvato Systems has
expanded its innovative cloud services and cloud manage-
ment portfolio.

Innovations at the Bertelsmann Printing Group included the
optimization of existing processes with new technologies
and creating innovative products and services. For example,
in gravure printing technical innovations were integrated
into the production process, making one-step manufacture
of products with a wrapper possible. GGP Media expanded
its innovative online platform P3, which is used for ordering
small printings, to include a completely digital process. Offset
printing continued to expand its 3D scanning products and
launched a division-spanning project to automate and stan-
dardize internal processes with the help of IT. Furthermore,
an innovation board was launched in mid-2018 to coordinate
innovation topics across divisions.

The innovations at Bertelsmann Education Group mainly con-
sist of the further development of digital and customized edu-
cation offerings and the expansion of existing business areas.
Relias continued to strengthen teaching products for medical
personnel in emergency care by acquiring the US online edu-
cation provider OnCourse Learning. At the same time, Relias
developed solutions for providing more data-based support to
customers in the healthcare sector in improving performance
within companies. Udacity developed new Nanodegree pro-
grams, also in the area of artificial intelligence, thus setting
further standards in student qualifications for future technol-
ogy jobs.

Report on Economic Position

Corporate Environment

Overall Economic Developments

In 2018 the global economy maintained its economic momen-

tum from the previous year, yet the pace slowed somewhat.
Real GDP increased by 3.7 percent compared to 3.8 percent

10 Financial Information Combined Management Report

in 2017. However, differences between countries in terms of
economic growth increased in 2018. Monetary tightening in
the United States affected international capital flows, which
dampened economic expansion in emerging countries.

The eurozone was not able to maintain the previous year's high
growth rate. Real GDP grew by 1.8 percent in 2018 compared
to 2.4 percent in the previous year. A drop in demand from
abroad as well as several country- and sector-specific factors
had the greatest negative impact on GDP.

The expansion of the German economy was weaker in 2018.
Real GDP grew by 1.4 percent compared to 2.2 percent in
the previous year. The economic upswing also slowed down
in France. Real GDP growth was 1.5 percent in 2018 com-
pared to 2.3 percent in 2017. The UK economy grew only
slightly against the backdrop of Brexit negotiations. Real
GDP grew by 1.4 percent compared to 1.8 percent in the
previous year.

In the United States, the economy expanded more rapidly.
Real GDP growth was 2.9 percent in 2018 compared to
2.2 percent in 2017. Major contributors to this growth were
the positive employment situation and its impact on con-
sumer expenditures.

Developments in Relevant Markets

The following analysis focuses on markets and regions that are
of a sufficient size and are strategically important from a Group
perspective.

Growth in European TV advertising markets was mixed in 2018.
TV advertising markets grew slightly in France and moderately
in the Netherlands, whereas the German market showed a
slight decrease and Belgium showed a moderate drop. Spanish
and Hungarian TV advertising markets were stable.

The markets for printed books achieved slightly positive
growth overall in 2018. Sales of printed books in the United
States showed moderate growth and in the United Kingdom
sales grew slightly, while the Spanish-language market and
the German market for printed books were stable. Publisher
sales of e-books declined moderately in the United States
and in the United Kingdom. The market for audiobooks con-
tinued to grow strongly in the United States and the United
Kingdom.

The magazine markets in Germany and France in 2018 were
characterized by strongly declining print advertising business
and significantly declining circulation business, while the digital
business in Germany posted strong growth.


--- Page 8 ---

The global music markets in 2018 reported moderate growth
in the publishing rights segment. The recording rights market
segment grew significantly.

The key service markets for Arvato, namely Customer Rela-
tionship Management, Supply Chain Management, Financial
Solutions and IT, saw moderate to significant growth.

The European offset printing markets declined moderately in
2018, while the European gravure printing markets declined
significantly. The development of the North American book
printing market was stable over the same period.

The education markets in the United States continued to
grow strongly overall in 2018 in the market segments where
Bertelsmann is involved — namely, e-learning in the areas of
healthcare and technology, and university education in the
university and services areas.

Significant Events in the Financial Year

On January 16, 2018, Thomas Buberl was appointed as a
new member of the Supervisory Board of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA with immediate effect.

On July 9, 2018, Gunter Gobel was appointed as Employee
Representative to the Supervisory Board of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA with immediate effect. As the new Chairman of the
Corporate Works Council, he replaced Helmut Gettkant, who
left the Supervisory Board at the end of the ordinary Annual
General Meeting.

In September 2018, Bertelsmann and the Saham Group in
Morocco announced the merger of their global CRM busi-
nesses. This merger serves to promote the development of
Arvato’s CRM business.

In November 2018, the Bertelsmann Education Group
acquired full ownership of the US online education pro-
vider OnCourse Learning from the private equity com-
pany CIP Capital. The company provides digital corporate
and advanced training courses to clients in the healthcare
and financial services sectors. The acquisition of OnCourse
Learning serves the further expansion of the education busi-
ness and in particular strengthens the activities of Relias, a
business of the Bertelsmann Education Group.

In late 2018, Groupe M6 (part of RTL Group) sold its majority
stake in the French soccer club Girondins de Bordeaux to
GACP, a US investment fund.

Anke Schaferkordt resigned from the Executive Board of
Bertelsmann Management SE effective December 31, 2018.

Results of Operations

The following analysis of earnings performance relates to
continuing operations as of December 31, 2018. Please refer
to the section “Performance of the Group Divisions” for a
more detailed picture of the results of operations.

Revenue Development

Group revenues in the financial year 2018 rose by 2.8 percent
to €17.7 billion (previous year: €17.2 billion). Revenue increases
were recorded by RTL Group, Penguin Random House,
BMG, Arvato and Bertelsmann Education Group. The
Group achieved organic growth of 2.7 percent, adjusted
for exchange rate, portfolio and other effects. Exchange
rate effects were -1.7 percent; portfolio and other effects
were 1.8 percent. Other effects were largely changes in
reported revenue due to the new IFRS 15 (further details are
presented in the notes to the Consolidated Financial State-
ments in the section “Impact of New Financial Reporting
Standards”).

Revenues at RTL Group rose 2.1 percent to €6,505 million
(previous year: €6,373 million). The organic growth was
3.1 percent. The primary growth contributors were the
rapidly growing digital business, the content production
arm Fremantle and RTL Nederland. Revenues at Penguin
Random House rose 1.9 percent to €3,424 million (previous
year: €3,359 million). The organic growth was 1.3 percent.
Exchange rate effects had a negative impact, while changes
in revenue reporting had a beneficial impact on revenues.

At €1,440 million, Gruner + Jahr’s revenues were down
4.8 percent year on year (previous year: €1,513 million). The
organic growth was 0.4 percent. The lower revenue level is
largely attributable to portfolio adjustments, which have in the
meantime been completed. This was offset by revenue growth
of the digital, agency and press distribution businesses. BMG
revenues increased by 7.5 percent to €545 million (previous
year: €507 million) due to continued expansion of business.
The organic growth was 7.8 percent. Revenues at Arvato rose
7.2 percent to €4,100 million (previous year: €3,823 million).
The organic growth was 5.6 percent. The increase stemmed in
particular from positive business development in the SCM and
Financial Solutions divisions and from changes in reporting rev-
enue. Revenues at Bertelsmann Printing Group fell 2.5 percent
to €1,639 million (previous year: €1,681 million) due to market
effects. The organic growth was -4.2 percent. Bertelsmann
Education Group increased its revenues by 36.4 percent to
€258 million (previous year: €189 million). The organic growth
was 13.9 percent. The rise was primarily the result of the first-
time consolidation of HotChalk and the organic expansion of
Relias. Bertelsmann Investments’ stakes are generally not con-
solidated, so there is usually no revenue reported for this division.

The revenue share generated by the growth businesses
increased to 34 percent overall (previous year: 32 percent),
thanks to organic growth and acquisitions, while the rev-
enue share of structurally declining businesses remained
stable at 4 percent (previous year: 4 percent). The growth
businesses comprise those activities that post continuous
revenue increases due to sustained positive market factors
and that have been identified as growth priorities as part
of Group strategy. These include the digital businesses of
RTL Group and Gruner + Jahr; the TV production, music
business and service businesses in the Arvato divisions of
SCM Solutions and Financial Solutions and Systems; and
the education business. The structurally declining busi-
nesses comprise those activities that post sustained reve-
nue losses due to market factors. These include in particular
the gravure printing activities and the storage media replica-
tion business.

There were only minor changes in the geographical breakdown
of revenues compared to the previous year. The share of
revenues generated in Germany was 33.2 percent compared
to 34.0 percent in the previous year. The revenue share

year: 13.4 percent). In the United Kingdom, the revenue
share was 6.5 percent (previous year: 6.8 percent). The share
of total revenues generated by the other European countries
amounted to 18.9 percent compared to 18.7 percent in the
previous year. The revenue share generated by the United
States was 22.0 percent (previous year: 20.5 percent), and
the other countries achieved a revenue share of 6.2 percent
(previous year: 6.6 percent). This means that the share of total
revenues generated by foreign business was 66.8 percent
(previous year: 66.0 percent). Year on year, there was a
slight change in the ratio of the four revenue sources (own
products and merchandise, services, advertising, rights and
licenses) to overall revenue.

Operating EBITDA

Bertelsmann achieved operating EBITDA of €2,586 million
in the financial year 2018 (previous year: €2,636 million).
The 1.9 percent drop is attributable to negative exchange
rate effects and capital gains for real estate sales real-
ized in the previous year. BMG, Arvato and Bertelsmann
Education Group posted substantially improved earnings.
The EBITDA margin decreased to 14.6 percent (previous
year: 15.3 percent).

Operating EBITDA at RTL Group was down 5.1 percent to
€1,402 million (previous year: €1,478 million). The previous
year's value included a high capital gain from the sale of
commercial buildings. Without this effect, the increase
was 1.3 percent, driven by higher contributions from RTL
Belgium, Groupe M6 and Fremantle. Operating EBITDA at
Penguin Random House rose by 1.3 percent to €528 million
(previous year: €521 million). Gruner + Jahr’s operating
EBITDA decreased by 3.4 percent to €140 million (previous
year: €145 million) due to declining advertising and circula-
tion revenues in the core businesses in Germany and France.
BMG's operating EBITDA increased by 17.3 percent to
€122 million (previous year: €104 million), attributable to con-
tinued business expansion. Arvato achieved operating EBITDA
of €377 million (previous year: €320 million). The strong
increase of 17.8 percent reflects improved earnings in all four
business areas. Operating EBITDA at Bertelsmann Printing
Group declined by 28.0 percent to €85 million (previous year:
€118 million) due to declining volumes and the persistent pres-
sure on prices. Operating EBITDA at Bertelsmann Education
Group increased significantly to €37 million (previous year:
€3 million). Relias in particular posted high earnings growth.
Bertelsmann Investments’ stakes are generally not consoli-
dated, so that in most cases no operating results are disclosed
for this division.

Special Items

Special items in the financial year 2018 totaled €-296 million
compared to €-83 million in the previous year. They consist
of impairment losses amounting to €-175 million (previous
year: €-100 million), results from disposals of invest-
ments and remeasurements totaling €157 million (previous
year: €193 million), as well as restructuring expenses and
other adjustments totaling €-278 million (previous year:
€-176 million). The increase in restructuring expenses is due
primarily to adjustments related to strategic reorientation
of the CRM activities (see also the reconciliation of EBIT to
operating EBITDA in the notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements).

EBIT

EBIT amounted to €1,620 million in the financial year 2018
(previous year: €1,896 million) after adjusting operating
EBITDA for special items totaling €-296 million (previous
year: €-83 million), and the amortization, depreciation, impair-
ments and reversals of impairments on intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment totaling €-670 million (previ-
ous year: €-657 million), which were not included in adjust-
ments.

Group Profit or Loss

The financial result was €-216 million, compared with the
previous year’s amount of €-219 million. The decrease in
income tax expense from €-472 million in the previous year
to €-301 million was basically the result of the lower earnings
before taxes and the measurement of deferred taxes. This
produced earnings after taxes from continuing operations
of €1,103 million (previous year: €1,205 million). Taking into
account the earnings after taxes from discontinued opera-
tions of €1 million (previous year: €-7 million), this resulted in
Group profit of €1,104 million (previous year: €1,198 million).
The share of Group profit attributable to non-controlling
interests came to €351 million (previous year: €422 million).
The share of Group profit attributable to Bertelsmann share-
holders was €753 million (previous year: €776 million). At
the Annual General Meeting of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA,
an unchanged year-on-year dividend payout of €180 million
will be proposed for the financial year 2018 (previous year:
€180 million).

Net Assets and Financial Position
Financing Guidelines

The primary objective of Bertelsmann’s financial policy is to
achieve a balance between financial security, return on equity
and growth. For this, Bertelsmann bases its financing policy
on the requirements of a “Baa1/BBB+” credit rating and the
associated qualitative and quantitative criteria. Credit ratings
and capital market transparency make a considerable contri-
bution to the company's financial security and independence.

In accordance with the Group structure, the capital allocation
is made centrally by Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA, which pro-
vides the Group companies with liquidity and manages the
issuance of guarantees and letters of comfort for them. The
Group consists largely of a single financial unit, thereby opti-
mizing capital procurement and investment opportunities.

Bertelsmann utilizes a financial control system employing
quantitative financial targets concerning the Group's eco-
nomic debt and, to a lesser extent, its capital structure. One of
the financial targets is a dynamic leverage factor limited to the
defined maximum of 2.5. As of December 31, 2018, the lever-
age factor of Bertelsmann was 2.7, higher than the previous
year's level (December 31, 2017: 2.5). This was attributable
mainly to an increase in net financial debt due to the acquisi-
tion of the US online education provider OnCourse Learning
in the fourth quarter of 2018 (see further explanation in the
section “Alternative Performance Measures”).

As of December 31, 2018, economic debt increased to
€6,619 million from €6,213 million in the previous year due
to an increase in net financial debt to €3,932 million (Decem-
ber 31, 2017: €3,479 million). In contrast, the present value of
obligations from operating leases decreased to €1,161 million
(December 31, 2017: €1,261 million), particularly due to
the sale of the French soccer club Girondins de Bordeaux.
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations rose to
€1,738 million as of December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017:
€1,685 million), primarily due to a decrease in the measure-
ment of plan assets.

Another financial target is the coverage ratio. This is calculated
as the ratio of operating EBITDA, used to determine the leverage
factor, to financial result and should exceed four. In the report-
ing period, the coverage ratio was 11.1 (previous year: 11.2).

1) After modifications.

The Group's equity ratio rose to 38.8 percent (December 31,
2017: 38.5 percent), which remains significantly above the
self-imposed minimum of 25 percent.

Financing Activities

In the reporting period a promissory note was repaid that was
due in June. Furthermore, in September 2018, Bertelsmann
placed a bond with a seven-year term and an issue volume
of €750 million. The bond, which is listed in Luxembourg, has
a fixed 1.25 percent coupon. The proceeds from the bond
were primarily used to finance the acquisition of OnCourse
Learning, the US online education provider.

Rating

Bertelsmann has been rated by the rating agencies Moody’s
and Standard & Poor's (S&P) since 2002. The agency ratings
facilitate access to the international capital markets and are
therefore a key element of Bertelsmann’s financial security.
Bertelsmann is rated by Moody's as “Baal” (outlook: stable)

and by S&P as “BBB+” (outlook: stable). Both credit ratings
are in the investment-grade category and meet Bertelsmann’s
target rating. Bertelsmann’s short-term credit quality rating is
“P-2" from Moody's and “A-2” from S&P.

Credit Facilities

In addition to available liquidity, the Bertelsmann Group has
access to a syndicated loan agreement with major interna-
tional banks. This forms the backbone of the strategic credit
reserve; Bertelsmann can utilize this with a term until 2021 to
draw up to €1.2 billion of revolving funds in euros, US dollars
and pounds sterling.

Cash Flow Statement

In the reporting period, Bertelsmann generated net cash
from operating activities of €1,437 million (previous year:
€1,605 million). The Group's long-term operating free cash
flow adjusted for non-recurring items was €1,753 million
(previous year: €1,822 million), and the cash conversion rate

Cash and cash equivalents on 12/31 (according to the consolidated balance sheet)

was 91 percent (previous year: 92 percent); see also the sec-
tion “Broadly Defined Performance Indicators.” The cash
flow from investing activities was €-1,130 million (previous
year: €-760 million). This included investments in intan-
gible assets, property, plant and equipment, and financial
assets of €-878 million (previous year: €-890 million). The
purchase price payments for consolidated investments (net
of acquired cash and cash equivalents) were €-556 million
(previous year: €-213 million). Proceeds from the sale of
subsidiaries and other business units and from the disposal
of other non-current assets were €304 million (previous
year: €343 million). Cash flow from financing activities was

to shareholders of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA remained
unchanged at €-180 million (previous year: €-180 million). Div-
idends to non-controlling interests and further payments to
partners in partnerships came to €-356 million (previous year:
€-743 million). This includes a special dividend of €57 million
(previous year: €373 million) as part of the increase of the
shareholding in Penguin Random House. As of December 31,
2018, Bertelsmann had cash and cash equivalents of
€1.4 billion (previous year: €1.4 billion).

Off-Balance-Sheet Liabilities

The off-balance-sheet liabilities include contingent liabilities
and other financial commitments, almost all of which result
from operating activities conducted by the divisions. Off-
balance-sheet liabilities declined moderately year on year. The
existing off-balance-sheet liabilities as of December 31, 2018,
had no significant negative effects on the Group’s net assets,
financial position and results of operation for the past or future
financial year.

Investments
Total including financial debt acquired of

€27 million (previous year: €14 million) amounted to €1,461 mil-
lion in the financial year 2018 (previous year: €1,117 million).

Investments according to the cash flow statement amounted
to €1,434 million (previous year: €1,103 million). As in
previous years, the majority of the €325 million investment
in property, plant and equipment (previous year: €360 million)
stemmed from Arvato. Investments in intangible assets came
to €295 million (previous year: €319 million) and were primar-
ily attributable to RTL Group for investments in film rights
and to BMG for the acquisition of music catalogs. The sum of
€258 million was invested in financial assets (previous year:
€211 million). These include, in particular, the investments of
Bertelsmann Investments. Purchase price payments for con-
solidated investments (less acquired cash and cash equiva-
lents) totaled €556 million in the reporting period (previous
year: €213 million) and were attributable, among other
things, to the acquisition of the US online education provider
OnCourse Learning.

Balance Sheet
Total assets amounted to €25.3 billion as of December 31,

2018 (previous year: €23.7 billion). Cash and cash equiva-
lents amounted to €1.4 billion (previous year: €1.4 billion).

Equity increased to €9.8 billion (previous year: €9.1 billion).
This resulted in an increase of the equity ratio to 38.8 percent
(previous year: 38.5 percent). Equity attributable to
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA shareholders was €8.5 billion
(previous year: €7.8 billion). Provisions for pensions and
similar obligations increased slightly to €1,738 million
(December 31, 2017: €1,685 million). Gross financial debt
increased to €5,337 million compared to €4,919 million as of
December 31, 2017, due to the taking up of financial debt as
reported in the section “Financing Activities.” Apart from that,
the balance sheet structure remained largely unchanged from
the previous year.

Profit Participation Capital

Profit participation capital had a par value of €301 million as
of December 31, 2018, which is unchanged from the previous
year. If the effective interest method is applied, the carrying
amount of profit participation capital was €413 million as of
December 31, 2018 (previous year: €413 million). The 2001
profit participation certificates (ISIN DEQ005229942) account
for 94 percent of par value of profit participation capital, while
the 1992 profit participation certificates (ISIN DE0005229900)
account for the remaining 6 percent.

The 2001 profit participation certificates are officially listed
for trading on the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange. Their price is listed as a percentage of par value.
The lowest closing rate of the 2001 profit participation

certificates in the financial year 2018 was 316.00 percent in
October; their highest was 352.85 percent in January.

Under the terms and conditions of the 2001 profit par-
ticipation certificates, the payout for each full financial
year is 15 percent of par value, subject to the availability
of sufficient Group profit and net income at the level of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. These conditions were met in
the past financial year. Accordingly, a payout of 15 percent of
the notional value of the 2001 profit participation certificates
will also be made for the financial year 2018.

The 1992 profit participation certificates, approved for trad-
ing on the Regulated Market in Frankfurt, only have a limited
cash trade due to their low volume. Payouts on the 1992 profit
participation certificates are based on the Group's return on
total assets. As the return on total assets for the financial
year 2018 was 6.83 percent (previous year: 7.73 percent),
the payout on the 1992 profit participation certificates for
the financial year 2018 will be 7.83 percent of their notional
value (previous year: 8.73 percent).

The payout distribution date for both profit participation cer-
tificates is expected to be May 22, 2019. Under the terms and
conditions of the profit participation certificates, the auditors
appointed by Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA are responsible
for verifying whether amounts to be distributed have been
calculated correctly. The auditors of both profit participation
certificates provide confirmation of this.

Performance of the Group Divisions
RTL Group

In 2018, RTL Group once again achieved record-level
revenues; operating EBITDA decreased against the backdrop
of high gains from disposals of buildings in the previous year,
but increased on a comparable basis. As part of its Total Video
strategy, RTL Group expanded its video-on-demand (VOD)
services, primarily in Germany, France and the Netherlands,
and saw a significant increase in subscriber numbers. At the
same time, the group invested more in in-house productions
and high-quality content for international distribution.
Online video views on RTL Group’s various digital platforms
increased markedly in the year under review, to a total of
497 billion (previous year: 420 billion).

Despite negative exchange-rate effects, RTL Group’s
revenues rose by 2.1 percent to a new record level of
€6.5 billion (previous year: €6.4 billion). The rapidly growing
digital business, the content production arm Fremantle and
RTL Nederland were the primary growth contributors. Digital
revenues, which mainly comprise revenues from multi-
platform networks, VOD offerings and ad-tech businesses,
increased to €985 million in the year under review (previous
year: €826 million) and thus contributed 15.1 percent
(previous year: 13.0 percent) to RTL Group’s total revenues.
Operating EBITDA fell by 5.1 percent to €1.4 billion in
2018, after €1.5 billion in the previous year. Excluding the
previous year's capital gain on disposal, the increase was
1.3 percent. The EBITDA margin was 21.5 percent, following
23.2 percent in the previous year.

Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland’s revenues and earnings
remained on a high level, although they slightly softened
over the previous year. The declining German TV advertis-
ing market, but also major sports events such as the soccer
World Cup and the Olympic Winter Games, all of which were
broadcast on public television, contributed to this develop-
ment. The family of channels’ combined average audience
share in the main target group was 27.5 percent (previous
year: 28.9 percent). At the end of 2018, Mediengruppe RTL
relaunched its VOD service TV Now, which increasingly
offers local, exclusive content and online-first formats.
Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland teamed up with partners to
launch the European NetID Foundation and with it a single
log-in standard.

In France, Groupe M6's revenues were down slightly on the
previous year, while operating EBITDA increased. In particu-
lar, M6 Web and a capital gain from the transfer of Girondins
de Bordeaux players contributed to the increase in earnings.
The soccer club was sold at the end of the year. Groupe M6
achieved a combined TV audience share of 21.4 percent

Penguin Random House

Penguin Random House recorded organic revenue growth
of 1.3 percent in the 2018 financial year. Negative exchange
rates effects were more than offset by a strong bestseller per-
formance, acquisitions and growth in digital audio downloads.

Including Verlagsgruppe Random House, the German pub-
lishing group wholly owned by Bertelsmann, the division
increased its revenues by 1.9 percent to €3.4 billion in 2018
(previous year: €3.4 billion). The book group’s operating
EBITDA increased by 1.3 percent to €528 million (previous
year: €521 million). The EBITDA margin was once again high,
at 15.4 percent (previous year: 15.5 percent).

The strongest growth drivers were audiobooks, which grew
substantially in all the core markets, as well as the publication
of former US First Lady Michelle Obama‘s memoir “Becoming.”
The book, which was launched simultaneously in 31 languages
in mid-November 2018 under the direction of Crown Publishing,
stormed the bestseller lists and sold more than seven million
copies across all formats in the six weeks to the end of the year.

Penguin Random House announced the increase of its stake
in the Brazilian publishing house Companhia das Letras to
70 percent. The publishing portfolio was also expanded with
the acquisition of the nonfiction publisher Rodale Books in the
United States and the Hindi-language paperback publisher
Hind Pocket Books in India. In Singapore, the group estab-
lished its new Penguin Random House South East Asia unit.
Penguin Random House also invested in the expansion of
direct relationships with readers and continued to optimize its
retail supply chain.

In the United States, the book publishing group placed 481 titles
on the “New York Times” bestseller lists last year, 69 at num-
ber one. Besides the top title, “Becoming” by Michelle Obama,
major sellers included “The President Is Missing” by Bill Clinton
and James Patterson, “12 Rules for Life” by Jordan B. Peterson
and “The Reckoning” by John Grisham. More than 11 million
copies of children’s book classics by Dr. Seuss were sold.

Penguin Random House UK recorded stable revenues in
2018, with growth in digital formats and license revenues. The
group's British imprints published 39 percent of the Top 10
titles on the “Sunday Times” weekly bestseller lists. The year’s
bestsellers included “Becoming” by Michelle Obama and
“12 Rules for Life” by Jordan B. Peterson, as well as “Jamie
Cooks Italy” by Jamie Oliver and “Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The
Meltdown” by Jeff Kinney.

Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial increased its reve-
nues in 2018 and expanded its children’s book and audiobook
offering for the Spanish-speaking world. Its bestselling titles

were “La desaparicion de Stephanie Mailer” by Joél Dicker,
“Ta no mataras” by Julia Navarro and “Sabotaje” by Arturo
Pérez Reverte.

In Germany, Verlagsgruppe Random House maintained its
market-leading position, growing both its revenues and earn-
ings. The publishing group had 386 titles on the “Spiegel”
bestseller lists, including 20 at number one. Their top-selling
title was Michelle Obama's memoir, “Becoming.” In 2018,
the publishing group purchased Der Audio Verlag, thereby
expanding its audiobook publishing program.

Numerous Penguin Random authors won prestigious awards,
including Michael Ondaatje, who received the Golden Man
Booker Prize for “The English Patient” as the best work of
fiction among the 50 Man Booker Prize winners through five
decades.

Gruner + Jahr

Gruner + Jahr continued its transformation. Revenues
declined to €1.4 billion (previous year: €1.5 billion) due to
portfolio adjustments; organically, revenues remained stable
at the previous year's level. The digital revenue share was fur-
ther expanded in the core countries. At €140 million (previous
year: €145 million), operating EBITDA was moderately below
the previous year. The EBITDA margin improved to 9.7 percent

(previous year: 9.6 percent).

G+J once again grew both its revenues and earnings in
Germany. The decline in the print advertising business and
newsstand sales, which was moderate compared to the rest
of the market, was offset by strong digital growth, the expan-
sion of the licensing business and new magazine businesses.
Territory, the agency for content-driven communications,
strongly increased its revenues and earnings.

The growing digital business also made a major contribu-
tion to the good business performance in Germany. In the
German core market, the digital share of total revenues rose
to around 29 percent. This increase was mainly driven by the
strong performance of the AppLike marketing platform, which
more than doubled its revenues. Other positive contributors
were the expansion of the licensing business, including at
“Schoner Wohnen,” and the growth of “Eat the World.” In
addition, G+J launched several innovative new magazines in
2018. Along with the gourmet magazine “B-Eat,” G+J shaped
and enriched the personality magazine genre with the addi-
tion of “Guido” and “Dr. v. Hirschhausen's Stern Gesund
Leben.” DDV Mediengruppe generated revenues on par with
the previous year.

G+J France’s business recorded a sharp drop in overall rev-
enues and earnings. Besides the sale of the title “VSD,” this
was primarily due to the digital marketing platforms. The brand
business, on the other hand, increased its earnings consider-
ably despite declining print revenues. The digital offerings of
the classic magazine brands — for example, “Voici,” “Gala”
and “Télé Loisirs” — again recorded high growth in revenues
and earnings.

BMG

In 2018, 10 years after the new BMG opened for business,
Bertelsmann’s music subsidiary continued to see significant
growth in its revenues and results, especially in its core mar-
kets: the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany.
After years of growth mainly through acquisition, the focus
increasingly shifted to organic growth. BMG benefited in par-
ticular from the expansion of its recordings business, which
grew strongly during the reporting year; the music publishing
business also recorded continuing growth. BMG artists and
songwriters had numerous hits in the single and album charts
in 2018.

Despite negative exchange rate effects, BMG's revenues
increased by 7.5 percent to €545 million (previous year:
€507 million). This was mainly due to organic growth. Oper-
ating EBITDA rose disproportionately by 17.3 percent to
€122 million (previous year: €104 million), boosted by the
increase in revenues and economies of scale. The EBITDA
margin rose to 22.5 percent (previous year: 20.5 percent).

In the recordings business, where market growth is being
driven by streaming, BMG was successful with artists includ-
ing Lil Dicky, Jason Aldean, Kylie Minogue, The Prodigy and
Kontra K, all with number-one albums or singles. BMG signed
new contracts with artists including Dido, Marianne Faithfull,
Lenny Kravitz and Adel Tawil. Keith Richards, whose publish-
ing interests have been represented by BMG since 2013 along
with Mick Jagger's, additionally signed a worldwide contract
for his solo recordings. BMG acquired the world music label
World Circuit Records and the US hip-hop and rap label RBC
Records.

In the music publishing business, world tours by artists
including Roger Waters and The Rolling Stones contributed
to higher collections, as did BMG's administration of the
Fremantle music catalog. Successful releases of works by
songwriters including Jason Evigan, Bebe Rexha, George Ezra,
Jess Glynne and The BossHoss added to business growth.
Among the most prominent music publishing signings were
Ringo Starr and JuiceWRLD. Lenny Kravitz and Yusuf a.k.a.
Cat Stevens renewed their contracts with the company. BMG
songwriters contributed to three of the five biggest summer
hits on US radio.

BMG Production Music, which provides music specifically for
movies, video games and advertising, was expanded and now
has a presence in eight territories thanks to new offices in
Singapore and Hong Kong.

BMG’s growing films business developed successfully
with highlights including US distributor Magnolia Pictures
acquiring North American rights to BMG's first major film

production, a documentary about rock singer Joan Jett
(“Bad Reputation”). In the books business, the number of
titles published by BMG doubled compared to 2017, and
included the illustrated books “Johnny Cash at Folsom and
San Quentin” and “Dreaming of Dylan.”

Arvato

Arvato recorded a very strong business performance in 2018.
Revenues from Bertelsmann’s service businesses rose by
7.2 percent to €4.1 billion (previous year: €3.8 billion), and
operating EBITDA improved by 17.8 percent to €377 million
(previous year: €320 million). In particular, the drivers behind
this extremely positive performance were the services pro-
vided for customers in high-tech and fashion by Arvato SCM
Solutions, Arvato Financial Solutions’ financial services busi-
nesses and Arvato Systems’ innovative IT solutions. Arvato’s
EBITDA margin improved to 9.2 percent from 8.4 percent in
the previous year.

After Bertelsmann had indicated at the end of January 2018
that it was reviewing strategic options for Arvato’s CRM busi-
ness, in September 2018 it was announced that Bertelsmann
and Morocco’s Saham Group were planning to merge their
global CRM businesses. The new group of companies,
Majorel, which took up operations on January 4, 2019, is one
of the market leaders in Europe, Africa and the Middle East,
and has a strong presence in America and Asia.

Arvato CRM Solutions’ service businesses delivered a satis-
factory overall performance in 2018, contributing to Arvato’s
revenue and earnings growth. The main growth driver was the
expansion of the business with large, international clients in
the high-tech and e-commerce sectors. In Germany, the con-
tract with a large mobile service provider was renewed, and
the global site network was built up and expanded.

The logistics services business within the SCM Solution
Group experienced strong organic growth during the report-
ing period — especially as a result of new orders and clients
gained in the fashion, high-tech and healthcare sectors in the
previous year. In addition, important master contracts with
customers were renewed. The existing worldwide network of
locations was enhanced with the opening of new distribution
centers and the expansion of existing ones.

The financial services businesses bundled in Arvato Financial
Solutions also developed positively during the reporting
period. Revenues and earnings were up year on year. This was
mainly supported by a good business performance in the GSA
region. 3C Deutschland GmbH was acquired in the first half
of 2018 with the aim of expanding and further automating the
existing range of solutions for the German automotive insur-
ance industry.

The IT services provider Arvato Systems grew organically and
profitably in the reporting period. Business with its proprietary
software solutions was successfully expanded and further
developed, among other things with the addition of a major
client from the United States. The IT services provider also

22 Financial Information Combined Management Report

made significant progress in transforming its existing busi-
ness models, and was able to win numerous customer orders,
especially in the fast-growing cloud business.

Bertelsmann Printing Group

The Bertelsmann Printing Group faced a very challenging
market environment in the 2018 financial year: Paper price
increases in particular led to restraint on the part of many
customers. Against this backdrop, the Group recorded a
-2.5 percent decline in revenues to €1,639 million (previous
year: €1,681 million). Operating EBITDA shrank to €85 million
(previous year: €118 million). The EBITDA margin amounted
to 5.2 percent (previous year: 7.0 percent).

The Bertelsmann Printing Group's offset printing business did
well in the 2018 financial year, despite a declining market. In
the course of the year, Mohn Media was able to renew impor-
tant customer contracts. GGP Media, the company specializ-
ing in print solutions for book publishers, posted slightly lower
revenues than in the previous year due to weaker demand
from several key customers. The BPG subsidiary Vogel Druck,
which specializes in magazines and catalogs with small to
medium-size print runs, was able to win new reference cus-
tomers.

The gravure printing activities bundled in the Prinovis Group
declined sharply in Germany during the reporting period, due
to significantly lower volumes in mail-order and magazine
publishing, and its revenues and EBITDA were significantly
lower than in the previous year. The Group’s gravure printing
business in the United Kingdom developed as expected,
despite challenging market conditions.

Demand in the US market was likewise subdued, especially
in the first half of 2018; as a result, the business activities
of the Bertelsmann Printing Group's US printing plants also
declined. Contracts with two important major customers were
secured long-term.

As expected, revenues in storage media replication fell against
the backdrop of a declining market. Sonopress was able to gain
market share with the acquisition of two major customers.

The print-related marketing services businesses assigned to
the Bertelsmann Printing Group offer cross-channel commu-
nication services, in particular for the retail, e-commerce and
advertising sectors. These businesses developed positively;
among other things, new customers were acquired and impor-
tant contracts renewed in the business segments of campaign
management and the DeutschlandCard multipartner program.
DeutschlandCard celebrated its 10th anniversary in the first
half of 2018.

Bertelsmann Education Group

Driven by the rising demand for educational services, the
Bertelsmann Education Group's activities saw continued
growth in 2018. The Group markedly increased its revenues
and operating result, and all of the division's companies
continued the strategic development of their educational
and service offerings.

Revenues from education businesses grew significantly in
the 2018 financial year, rising by 36.4 percent to €258 million
(previous year: €189 million). The full consolidation of the uni-
versity services provider HotChalk, the continued growth of the
e-learning provider Relias and the acquisition of the US educa-
tion company OnCourse Learning were major contributors to
this. As a result, the Bertelsmann Education Group's operating
EBITDA improved significantly to €37 million (previous year:
€3 million). The EBITDA margin was 14.5 percent (previous
year: 1.8 percent).

The Bertelsmann subsidiary Relias achieved double-digit
organic growth during the reporting period and expanded its
client base to more than 8.400 institutions whose employees
enrolled in about 37.2 million online courses in 2018. In
November, Bertelsmann acquired full ownership of the US

The online learning provider Udacity further developed its
range of courses and introduced new Nanodegree programs
in fields including artificial intelligence. It also continued
expanding its B2B business; at the end of 2018, more than
50 corporate clients were using Udacity services. Bertelsmann
owns a significant stake in the Silicon Valley-based company.

dents enrolled in courses supported by HotChalk also rose.

Bertelsmann Investments

In the 2018 financial year, Bertelsmann Investments once again
expanded its global network of shareholdings in innovative
start-ups. Bertelsmann Asia Investments (BAI), Bertelsmann
Brazil Investments (BBI), Bertelsmann India Investments (BI!)
and Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments (BDMI) made
approximately 60 new and follow-on investments during the
reporting period. At the same time, the funds exited from
several shareholdings. As a result, at year-end Bertelsmann
held shares in 189 companies through its corporate funds.

Bertelsmann Investments once again made a significant posi-
tive contribution to Group profit in the year under review,
primarily due to increases in the value of investments and
gains on disposals. EBIT amounted to €96 million (previous
year: €141 million).

BAI made 23 new investments, including in the Chinese music
streaming platform NetEase Cloud Music. Follow-on invest-
ments were made in 16 companies, including the fitness app
Keep and the supply chain financing service provider Linklogis.
As in 2017, four BAI holdings went public in the period under
review: the used-car portal Tuanche, the discount platform
Meituan Dianping, the fashion e-commerce platform Mogu,
and the tech company Xiaomi, in which the fund owns an
indirect stake. In the 10 years of its existence, BAI has sup-
ported the IPOs of 10 shareholdings.

In Brazil, additional investments were made in the focus area
of education. In April, Bertelsmann acquired a majority stake
in Afferolab, one of the country’s leading providers of cor-
porate training, through BBI and further increased this share-
holding in December. The group also expanded its education
network in the healthcare sector in partnership with Crescera
Investimentos.

During the reporting period, BIl acquired stakes in the Indian
company Licious, a direct-to-consumer food platform, and in
the logistics platform Lets Transport. Follow-on investments
were also made in the social media portal Roposo and in
Eruditus Executive Education, a continuing training company
that develops courses in partnership with international
Ivy League colleges. In addition, BIl successfully managed
its first two divestments, from Saavn and IndiaProperty.

BDMI made 17 new and follow-on investments, including in
the network FloSports, which specializes in live broadcasts of
sporting events.

Since 2012, the four funds have invested nearly €800 million
in digital companies. Returns from the disposal of investments
amounted to more than €400 million in the same period.

General Statement by Company Management
on the Economic Situation

Over the financial year 2018, Bertelsmann’'s businesses
posted overall positive development. The Group improved
its growth profile with the continuing organic and acquisi-
tive expansion of its growth platforms. Bertelsmann also
systematically continued its transformation into a faster-
growing, more digital, more international and more diversi-
fied Group.

Group revenues in the reporting period rose moderately by
2.8 percent to €17.7 billion from €17.2 billion in the previous
year and were therefore in line with estimates (outlook in
2017 Annual Report: moderate increase in revenues). Organic
growth was 2.7 percent. Operating EBITDA at €2,586 million
was only slightly below (by 1.9 percent) the previous year’s
high figure of €2,636 million, which included material capital
gains resulting from strategic real estate transactions (out-
look in the 2017 Annual Report: moderate decline in oper-
ating EBITDA). At €121 million, the BVA used for Group
management was strongly below the previous year's figure of
€163 million (outlook in 2017 Annual Report: strongly declin-
ing BVA). The development reflects the increase in the aver-
age level of capital invested and the lower operating result.

In the financial year 2018, steady efforts continued to focus
on implementing the strategy. In addition to the focus at
RTL Group on local content and in-house productions and
on new magazines at Gruner + Jahr, the merging of CRM
businesses at Bertelsmann and the Saham Group, effective
as of 2019, made a contribution to strengthening core
businesses. As part of the digital transformation, RTL Group
continued to expand its video-on-demand offerings and
also merged the online advertising marketers SpotX and
SmartClip. Verlagsgruppe Random House strengthened its
offerings in the audio market with the acquisition of the
audiobook publisher DAV, and Gruner + Jahr continued
to develop the app discovery platform AppLike. Growth
platforms were expanded, especially in the area of education
with the acquisition of the US online education provider
OnCourse Learning and the acquisition of a majority stake in
the US university services provider HotChalk. Bertelsmann
also made progress in China, India and Brazil with a number
of new and follow-on investments through the funds grouped
under Bertelsmann Investments.

Net assets and financial position remain solid despite the
increased economic debt. As a result of the acquisition of
OnCourse Learning in the fourth quarter of 2018, the lever-
age factor during the reporting period was 2.7, above the
previous year’s level. The maturity profile of the capital
market financings was further optimized through the issue
made in the financial year 2018. As of December 31, 2018,

26 Financial Information Combined Management Report

the cash and cash equivalents reported at €1.4 billion
(December 31, 2017: €1.4 billion) represent sufficient liquidity.
The ratings agencies Moody's and S&P continued to rate
Bertelsmann as “Baal” and “BBB+,” respectively, with a
stable outlook.

Alternative Performance Measures

In this Combined Management Report, the following
Alternative Performance Measures, which are not defined
in accordance with IFRS, are used to explain the results of
operations and/or net assets and financial position. These
should not be considered in isolation but as complementary
information for evaluating Bertelsmann’s business situation
and are differentiated in terms of strictly defined and broadly
defined key performance indicators, in the same way as the
value-oriented management system.

The organic growth is calculated by adjusting the reported
revenue growth for the impact of exchange rate effects,
corporate acquisitions and disposals as well as other effects.
When determining the exchange rate effects, the functional
currency that is valid in the respective country is used. The
other effects include changes in methods and reporting, for
example. These chiefly involve changes in presentation in
the income statement due to application of the new IFRS 15
(further details are presented in the notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in the section “Impact of New Financial
Reporting Standards”).

Operating EBITDA

Operating EBITDA is determined as earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation, amortization and impairment losses and is
adjusted for special items. The adjustments for special items
serve to determine a sustainable operating result that could
be repeated under normal economic circumstances and is
not affected by special factors or structural distortions. These
special items primarily include impairment losses and reversals

means that operating EBITDA is a meaningful performance
indicator. Disposal effects of strategic real estate transactions

BVA

BVA measures the profit realized above and beyond the
appropriate return on invested capital. This form of value
orientation is reflected in strategic investment, portfo-
lio planning and the management of Group operations
and, together with qualitative criteria, provides the basis
for measuring the variable portion of management remu-
neration. BVA is calculated as the difference between net
operating profit after tax (NOPAT) and the cost of capital.
NOPAT is calculated on the basis of operating EBITDA.

deducting depreciation and amortization, provided that
they are not included in special items, and a flat 33 percent
tax. Cost of capital is the product of the weighted aver-
age cost of capital (WACC) and the average level of capital
invested. The uniform WACC after taxes is 8 percent. The
average invested capital is calculated quarterly on the basis
of the Group's operating assets less non-interest-bearing
operating liabilities. In addition, 66 percent of the net pres-
ent value of the operating leases plus other commitments
from technical broadcasting facilities are included in the
calculation of invested capital. BVA is determined without
taking into account the Bertelsmann Investments division
since business performance is represented primarily on the
basis of EBIT. Accordingly, the method does not include
a NOPAT contribution from this division. To maintain
consistency, the invested capital will be adjusted for the
Bertelsmann Investment division; hence, capital costs will
be neutralized.

Cash Conversion Rate

The cash conversion rate serves as a measure of cash
generated from business activities and is calculated as
the ratio of operating free cash flow to operating EBIT.
The operating free cash flow is determined on the basis of
the cash flow from operating activities as reported in the
consolidated cash flow statement, whereby the impact of
paid income taxes and the change in provisions for pen-
sions and similar obligations on cash flow from operating
activities is offset. Operating free cash flow is also reduced
by investments in intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment or, if applicable, increased by proceeds from
the sale of non-current assets. Further adjustments are
made to ensure an allocation of capital flows to the rel-
evant periods and to offset the impact of payment flows
resulting from special items on the operating free cash
flow in a way that is methodically consistent with the
operating EBITDA. Further adjustments in the financial
year 2018 mainly reflected the impact of restructuring

measures on payments. The operating EBITDA is used to
calculate the operating EBIT by deducting amortization
and depreciation, provided that these are not included
in special items. The Group aims to maintain a cash con-
version rate of 90 percent to 100 percent as a long-term
average.

Economic Debt

Net financial debt is calculated on the basis of gross finan-
cial debt, which comprises the balance sheet items current
and non-current financial debt minus cash and cash equiva-
lents. Economic debt is defined as net financial debt less
the 50 percent par value component of the hybrid bonds
plus provisions for pensions, profit participation capital
and the net present value of operating leases. In calculat-
ing economic debt, the hybrid bonds are accounted for at
50 percent as both bonds are classified by the rating agen-
cies as 50 percent equity. Economic debt is modified for the
purposes of calculating the leverage factor.

Economic debt" / Operating EBITDA

Leverage Factor

One of the financial targets is a dynamic leverage factor cal-
culated as the ratio of economic debt to operating EBITDA;
this factor should not regularly exceed the defined maximum
of 2.5. In determining the leverage factor, the economic debt
and the operating EBITDA are modified to enable financial
management that corresponds to the Group's structure and its
tolerable indebtedness. The modifications in regard to the eco-
nomic debt largely relate to cash and cash equivalents, which
are tied up in the Group while the modifications in regard to
the operating EBITDA address the Group’s structure and its co-
shareholder shares. The leverage factor determined in this way
is thus always more conservative than the figure that would be
obtained using only the items recognized in the balance sheet.

Significant Events after the Balance Sheet Date

Effective January 4, 2019, all worldwide Customer Relationship
Management businesses at Bertelsmann and the Saham Group
in Morocco were merged. Each partner holds 50 percent of
the shares in the new company Maiorel, which is one of the
market leaders in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and
has a strong presence in America and Asia. The contribu-
tion of the CRM businesses from Saham is recognized in the
Bertelsmann Consolidated Financial Statements as a business
combination within the meaning of IFRS 3 and will be fully
consolidated by Bertelsmann Group from the financial year
2019 onward.

On February 1, 2019, Groupe M6 (part of RTL Group) announced
its plans to acquire the TV activities of Groupe Lagardére. The
two French companies are conducting exclusive negotiations.
As a result of this transaction, Groupe M6 would expand its
family of channels with the market leader in French children’s
television, Gulli, among other things.

Risks and Opportunities

Risk Management System

The purpose of the Bertelsmann risk management system
(RMS) is the early identification and evaluation of, as well as
response to, internal and external risks. The internal control
system (ICS), an integral component of the RMS, moni-
tors the effectiveness of the risk response measures that
have been implemented. The aim of the RMS is to identify,
at an early stage, material risks to the Group so that risk
response measures can be taken and controls implemented.
Risks are possible future developments or events that could
result in a negative deviation from the outlook or objectives
for Bertelsmann. In addition, risks can negatively affect the
achievement of the Group's strategic, operational, reporting
and compliance-related objectives and its reputation.

The risk management process is based on the internationally
accepted frameworks of the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO
Enterprise Risk Management — Integrated Framework and
Internal Control — Integrated Framework, respectively) and
is organized in subprocesses of identification, assessment,
response, control, communication and monitoring. A major
element of risk identification is a risk inventory that lists
significant risks year by year, from the profit center level
upward. These risks are aggregated step by step at the
division and Group levels. This ensures that risks are
registered where their impact would be felt. There is
also a Group-wide reassessment of critical risks every six
months and quarterly reporting in case the risk situation
has changed. Ad hoc reporting requirements ensure that
significant changes in the risk situation during the course
of the year are brought to the attention of the Executive
Board. The risks are compared to risk management and
control measures to determine the net risk position. Both
one- and three-year risk assessment horizons are applied
to enable the timely implementation of risk response
measures. The basis for determining the main Group risks
is the three-year period, similar to medium-term corporate
planning. Risk assessment is the product of the estimated
negative impact on Group free cash flow should the risk
occur and the estimated probability of occurrence. Risk
monitoring is conducted by Group management on an
ongoing basis. The RMS, along with its component ICS,
is constantly undergoing further development and is
integrated into ongoing
Executive Board and Supervisory Board. Corporate Risk

The Group auditors inspect the risk early-warning system
for its capacity to identify developments early on that could
threaten the existence of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
according to section 91(2) of Germany's Stock Corporation
Act (AktG) and then report their findings to the Supervisory
Board of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. Corporate Audit
conducts ongoing reviews of the adequacy and functional
capability of the RMS in all divisions apart from RTL Group.
RTL Group’s RMS is evaluated by the respective internal
auditing department and by the external auditor. Any
issues that are identified are promptly remedied through
appropriate measures. The Bertelsmann Executive Board
defined the scope and focus of the RMS based on the
specific circumstances of the company. However, even

Accounting-Related Risk Management System and Internal
Control System

The objectives of the accounting-related RMS and ICS are
to ensure that external and internal accounting are proper
and reliable in accordance with applicable laws and that
information is made available without delay. Reporting should
also present a true and fair view of Bertelsmann’s net assets,
financial position and results of operation. The following
statements pertain to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(including the notes to the sections “Consolidated Financial
Statements” and “Combined Management Report”), interim
reporting and internal management reporting.

The ICS for the accounting process consists of the follow-
ing areas: The Group’s internal rules for accounting and
the preparation of financial statements (e.g., IFRS manual,
guidelines and circulars) are made available without delay to
all employees involved in the accounting process. The Group
financial statements are prepared in a reporting system
that is uniform throughout the Group. Extensive automatic
system controls ensure the consistency of the data in the
financial statements. The system is subject to ongoing
development through a documented change process. Sys-
tematized processes for coordinating intercompany trans-
actions serve to prepare the corresponding consolidation
steps. Circumstances that could lead to significant misinfor-
mation in the Consolidated Financial Statements are moni-
tored centrally by employees of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
and by RTL Group (for the preconsolidated subgroup) and
then verified by external experts as required. Central contact
persons from Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and the divisions
are also in continuous contact with local subsidiaries to

30 Financial Information Combined Management Report

ensure IFRS-compliant accounting as well as compliance
with reporting deadlines and obligations. These preventive
measures are supplemented by specific controls in the form
of analyses by the Corporate Financial Reporting depart-
ment of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and RTL Group (for
the preconsolidated subgroup). The purpose of such analy-
ses is to identify any remaining inconsistencies. The control-
ling departments at the Group and division levels are also
integrated into the internal management reporting. Internal
and external reporting are reconciled during the quarterly
segment reconciliation process. The further aim in introduc-
ing a globally binding control framework for the decentral-
ized accounting processes is to achieve a standardized ICS
format at the level of the local accounting departments of
all fully consolidated Group companies. The findings of the
external auditors, Corporate Audit and the internal auditing
department of RTL Group are promptly discussed with the
affected companies and solutions are developed. An annual
self-assessment is conducted to establish reporting on the
quality of the ICS in the key fully consolidated Group compa-
nies. The findings are discussed at the divisional level. Like
the RMS, each ICS cannot guarantee with absolute certainty
that significant misinformation in the accounting process
can be prevented or identified.

Corporate Audit and the internal auditing department of
RTL Group evaluate the accounting-related processes as
part of their auditing work. As part of the auditing process,
the Group auditor also reports to the Audit and Finance
Committee of the Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA Supervisory
Board about any significant vulnerabilities of the accounting-
related ICS that were identified during the audit and the
findings regarding the risk early-warning system.

Major Risks to the Group

Bertelsmann is exposed to a variety of risks. The major risks
to Bertelsmann identified in the risk reporting are listed in
order of priority in the table below. Details on information
security risks can be found in a separate chapter further
below. In line with the level of possible financial loss, the
risks are classified as low, moderate, significant, consider-
able or endangering for the purposes of risk tolerability. The
risk inventory carried out did not identify any risks that would
be classified as considerable or endangering.

Given the diversity of the businesses in which Bertelsmann
is active and the corresponding diversity of risks to which
the various divisions are exposed, the key strategic and
operational risks to the Group that have been identified are
specified below. Risks from acquisitions and information

security risks were identified as the primary risks and are
therefore described separately. This is followed by an outline
of legal and regulatory risks and financial market risks. These
risks are largely managed at the corporate level.

Strategic and Operational Risks

The expansion of the global economy slowed somewhat in
2018. Looking forward it is expected that economic growth
will return to normal. Nonetheless, Bertelsmann’s business
development is still subject to certain risks. In particular, a
disorderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU
or further escalation of international trade conflicts could
adversely impact Bertelsmann's economic environment and
thus increase the risk from economic developments. Since
the Brexit decision, Bertelsmann has been continuously moni-
toring the exit process to identify any risks at an early stage.
A Group-wide Brexit Taskforce was established to coordi-
nate information. In the short to medium term, other signifi-
cant Group risks include loss of audience and market share,
customer risks, changes in the market environment, pricing
and margin risks, supplier relationship risks and risks associ-
ated with economic development. How these risks develop
depends to a large extent on changes in customer behavior
due to factors such as the continued digitization of media, the
development and implementation of products and services
by competitors, bad debt losses, and default and interference
along the production chains in individual sectors, such as IT.
Legal and regulatory risks as well as employee-related risks
are moderate risks for Bertelsmann, while financial market

risks and risks from future technological challenges in the
three-year period under review are classified as low.

Increasing competition and constant change, particularly in
the digital environment, are resulting in a stronger fragmen-
tation of RTL Group's markets as audiences will have more
choice (e.g., through online platforms) and, at the same
time, the market-entry barriers are being lowered. The pos-
sible risks of this for RTL Group are decreasing audience and
advertising market shares of its advertising-financed chan-
nels and therefore, ultimately, lower revenues. To counter
these risks, RTL Group is continuously revising and develop-
ing the channels and program strategies. By linking tradi-
tional, linear offerings with new digital business models and
by strengthening existing investments in the online video
market and in advertising technologies, RTL Group counters
risks from digitization while actively influencing this develop-
ment. Increasing competition in the area of program acqui-
sition and TV production and the growing dependence on
individual production companies, coupled with the risk of
potential cost increases, could also impact RTL Group's
ability to generate revenues. This risk is being reduced by
expanding the program share of in-house productions — in
particular local content. Furthermore, economic develop-
ment directly impacts the TV advertising markets and there-
fore RTL Group's revenue. This risk is being countered by
focusing on developing non-advertising revenue streams, for
example, distribution revenues from platform operators. To
reduce the risk of customer losses, the aim is to establish
long-term customer relationships.

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2018 31

Falling e-book sales constitute one risk for Penguin
Random House, triggered in particular by falling sales prices.
Declining revenues from physical books, due to declining
sales volumes in brick-and-mortar book retail, is another risk.
Penguin Random House is countering these risks by introduc-
ing differentiated pricing, increasing online sales of physical
books, and continuously examining alternative selling and
marketing options. Any risk of bad debt loss is being limited
through debtor management and in some cases through
credit insurance. In addition to the risk of cost increases,
Penguin Random House is finding itself exposed to risks from
general economic uncertainty, which could lead to lower
sales. The risks are addressed through careful management
of supplier relationships and innovative marketing activities,
and by maintaining a flexible cost structure that allows for a
quick response in the event of an economic downturn.

The risk of a deterioration of the overall economic environ-
ment and the resulting declines in advertising and cir-
culation revenues, as well as the continuously changing
conditions in the digital business, represent significant chal-
lenges for Gruner + Jahr. A changing market environment,
marked by product innovations and increased consolida-
tion of agencies and marketers, is confronted with a wide-
spread decrease in demand for print products, which as a
result of pressure on prices and conditions can lead to lower
margins. Furthermore, there is the risk of losing key custom-
ers as advertising customers could switch to other media,
notably digital media. The risks are being countered by cost
and customer management; the development of new, in
particular digital, forms of offerings; and product, price and
quality improvements.

Risks that affect BMG primarily concern the client portfolio
(extending contracts with artists/authors and distribution
partners), its monetarization (physical and digital distribution
partners), corporate growth (integration of acquisitions) and
the scalability of the company (including technical platform
and organization). Market risks are addressed through high
revenue diversification (clients/catalogs, business segments,
regions) and contractual protection clauses (securing the
recouping of advances).

Arvato sees itself as particularly exposed to risks from
customer and supplier relationships. The potential loss of
key customers is being countered through contracts offering
comprehensive service packages with simultaneously flexible
cost structures. On the supplier side there are risks associated
with the availability of services. Countermeasures include
an active exchange with existing suppliers and entering
into long-term framework agreements. Technological trends

32 Financial Information Combined Management Report

arising from digitization and ongoing automation could in
some cases damage the business model and competitiveness
in individual customer segments. New competitors entering
the market could intensify the competitive pressure and lead
to lower margins. By developing the range of services, the
aim is to improve the competitive position and to increase
customer loyalty through integrated solutions. A worsening of
the economic environment could result in declining revenues
and thus lower margins, which would necessitate cost-cutting
measures and capacity downsizing. Broad diversification
across regions and sectors helps to reduce this risk.

For Bertelsmann Printing Group, customer risks are the most
significant risks. In addition, price and margin pressures result
from a market environment that is characterized by over-
capacity. Along with the dependence on a handful of suppli-
ers, there are further risks on the supplier side associated with
rising raw material prices — particularly for paper. Furthermore,
deterioration in the economic environment also may lead to
declining circulations. Similarly, the increasing use of digital
media is accelerating the decline in circulation, particularly in
the magazine segment. These risk minimization strategies are
based, in particular, on the expansion of innovative print ser-
vices, constantly optimizing cost structures and monitoring
markets on an ongoing basis.

For the Bertelsmann Education Group, increasing competition
with other online providers, particularly in the US healthcare
market, can lead to growing price and margin pressure and
impact the planned growth targets. These risks are being
countered in particular through strategic partnerships and
marketing measures.

The key risks for Bertelsmann Investments consist of falling
portfolio valuations and a lack of exit opportunities. These
risks are being addressed through a standardized investment
process and continuous monitoring of investments.

The increasing pace of change in the markets and in
Bertelsmann’s business segments means that employees
will need to be more willing and able to adapt in the future.
There are also continuing demographic risks that impact the
recruitment, development and retention of talent as a result
of shifts in the age distribution of the workforce. To counter-
act this, employees are being offered further individual edu-
cation, comprehensive health programs, a competitive salary
and flexible working models. Bertelsmann is also enhancing
its talent management by pushing forward on digitization of
the recruiting process and making it easier for employees to
switch jobs within the Group by harmonizing processes and
structures.

Acquisition-Related Risks

The Group strategy focuses on acquisitions of businesses and
organic growth. The risk of potential mistakes when selecting
investments and the allocation of investment funds is limited by
means of strict investment criteria and processes. Acquisitions
present both opportunities and risks. For example, integration
into the Group requires one-time costs that are usually offset
by increased benefits in the long term, thanks to synergy
effects. The risks here are that the integration costs may be
higher than expected or the predicted level of synergies may
not materialize. The integration processes are therefore being
monitored by management on an ongoing basis.

Information Security Risks

For Bertelsmann, the ability to provide information in a
timely, complete, error-free and confidential way, and to pro-
cess it without disruptions, is crucial to its success, and is
becoming increasingly important. The hurdles to this abil-
ity are internal processes that are often not yet standard-
ized, comparatively fragmented IT system landscapes and,
as digitization of business progresses, a bigger playing field
for cybercrime whose players are becoming more and more
professional. Bertelsmann has addressed this tougher oper-
ating environment at the management level by operating an
Information Security Management System (ISMS, based on
ISO 27001) for structured management of cyber risks across
the Group and to monitor compliance with minimum Group
standards. In order to have access both to modern cyber-
security technologies and to specialist expertise in emergen-
cies, Bertelsmann maintains a network of external partners
and is a member of the German Cyber Security Organization
(Deutsche Cyber-Sicherheitsorganisation: DCSO). Further-
more, Bertelsmann has also responded to the increased
threat by introducing specific measures, such as a Group-
wide platform to identify gaps and security issues in all
systems worldwide that are connected to the Internet. An
indicative assessment of risks to information security was
conducted in the fiscal year 2018 on the basis of the method
used to assess operative Group risks. The results indicate
that information security risks are moderate, analogous to
the categorization of major Group risks.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

Bertelsmann, with its worldwide operations, is exposed to
a variety of legal and regulatory risks concerning, for exam-
ple, litigation or varying interpretations of tax assessment
criteria. Bertelsmann has television and radio operations in
several European countries that are subject to regulation. In

Germany, for example, the media is subject to oversight by
the Commission on Concentration in the Media. Bertelsmann
Group companies occupy leading market positions in many
lines of business and may therefore have limited potential
for growth through acquisition due to antitrust legislation.
Moreover, the education activities are subject to regula-
tory provisions of government authorities and accreditation
bodies. Other risks include litigation relating to company
acquisitions and disposals, which mainly relate to different
interpretations of contract components, as well as increased
data protection regulations leading to growing challenges,
especially for data-based business models. These risks are
being continuously monitored by the relevant divisions
within the Group.

Several subsidiaries of RTL Group are being sued by the
broadcaster RTL 2 Fernsehen GmbH & Co. KG and its sales
house El Cartel Media GmbH & Co. KG before the regional court
in Dusseldorf, Germany, seeking disclosure of information to
substantiate a possible claim for damages. The proceedings
follow the imposition of a fine in 2007 by the German Federal
Cartel Office for abuse of market dominance with regard to
discount scheme agreements (“share deals”) granted by
IP Deutschland GmbH and SevenOne Media GmbH to media
agencies. The German Federal Cartel Office argued that these
discounts would foreclose the advertising market for small
broadcasters. In 2014, the district court of Dusseldorf decided
to order an expert report. The expert concluded in February
2018 that the likelihood of damages cannot be proven with
certainty. In July 2018, RTL II filed a motion claiming that the
expert was not impartial. IP Deutschland has rejected the
motion for lack of impartiality as unfounded. The court has
not made a decision. Similar proceedings from other small
broadcasters, initiated in different courts, were unsuccessful
or have been withdrawn.

In June 2016, the main competitors of Fun Radio alleged
that a host of the morning show had influenced Fun Radio's
results by encouraging his listeners to give favorable treat-
ment to Fun Radio in the Médiamétrie surveys. In response to
these allegations, Médiamétrie decided to remove Fun Radio
from its surveys. Following a legal procedure initiated by Fun
Radio, Médiamétrie was required to reinstate Fun Radio in
the audience results surveys as of September 2016. Never-
theless, Médiamétrie decided to lower Fun Radio's audience
results in its published surveys, alleging the existence of a
“halo effect.” Following a procedure initiated by Fun Radio, a
judicial expert was appointed in December 2017 to examine
Médiamétrie’s assessment of the alleged halo effect, and the
judicial expert's final report is expected in the second quar-
ter of 2019. As of September 2017, Médiamétrie has again

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2018 33


--- Page 31 ---

published the full audience results for Fun Radio. In parallel
to the above procedure, the main competitors of Fun Radio
also filed, in December 2016, a claim for damages, claiming
unfair competition, but this procedure is suspended until the
end of the judicial expertise. In the meantime, four of the six
claimants withdrew their claim from the proceedings.

On February 22, 2018 the Spanish Competition Authority
(CNMC) communicated to Atresmedia the opening of a
proceeding for sanctions in relation to possible practices
restricting competition prohibited by article 1 of the Spanish
Competition Act. On February 6, 2019 the CNMC notified
the Statement of Objections in which it assumes proven that
specific commercial practices by Atresmedia are restrictive of
competition. The directors of Atresmedia and their legal advi-
sors take the view that the aforesaid Statement of Objections
is not sufficiently founded and have confidence in a positive
outcome for Atresmedia, either during the administrative pro-
ceeding or in court proceeding in the event that the CNMC
will take a decision imposing sanctions.

Foreign direct investments in the People’s Republic of China
are subject to a number of regulatory restrictions. To satisfy
local requirements, some of Bertelsmann’s activities in China
are held as so-called VIE structures. These types of arrange-
ments are standard market practice for investments in China.
However, these structures are rarely the subject of legal dis-
putes in China, which means that there is a certain risk that
it will not be possible to safeguard VIE structures through the
courts, particularly if the People’s Republic changes its poli-
cies toward investments by foreigners (particularly in respect
to VIE structures) or if courts and authorities change their case
law or administrative practice. The draft “PRC Foreign Invest-
ment Law” of 2015 was reworked in December 2018 by the
Chinese Ministry of Commerce in view of the US-China trade
conflict and equal treatment of foreign investors in China. In
contrast to the draft of 2015, this version no longer refers to
VIE structures, and some commentators assume that VIE
structures will accordingly continue to be unregulated. If pro-
visions of this law are infringed, all income could be seized
from forbidden or also only restricted investments. Other
commentators presume that the Chinese government would
treat (only) Chinese companies in critical industries as for-
eign companies, despite their VIE structure. Further develop-
ments in this legislative process are being keenly observed by
local Bertelsmann lawyers and their advisors in cooperation
with the Corporate Legal Department in order to anticipate
the effects of the law as early as possible. This affects com-
panies within Fremantle, BMG, Arvato and the Bertelsmann
Education Group, as well as investments by Bertelsmann Asia
Investments (BAI).

34 Financial Information Combined Management Report

Aside from the matters outlined above, no further significant legal
and regulatory risks to Bertelsmann are apparent at this time.

Financial Market Risks

As an international corporation, Bertelsmann is exposed
to various forms of financial market risk, especially interest
rate and currency risks. These risks are largely controlled by
the Central Financial Department on the basis of guidelines
established by the Bertelsmann Executive Board. Derivative
financial instruments are used solely for hedging purposes.
Bertelsmann mainly uses currency derivatives to hedge exist-
ing foreign currency risks from intercompany financing and
operating liabilities. Some firm commitments denominated in
foreign currency are partially hedged when they are made,
with the hedged amount being adapted over time. A number
of subsidiaries are based outside the eurozone. The result-
ing translation risk to the leverage factor is managed based
on economic debt in relation to operating EBITDA (leverage
factor). Bertelsmann’s long-term focus is on the maximum
leverage factor permitted for the Group. Foreign currency
translation risks arising from net investments in foreign enti-
ties are not hedged. The cash flow risk from interest rate
changes is centrally monitored and controlled as part of
interest rate management. The aim is to achieve a balanced
ratio of different fixed interest rates through the selection of
appropriate maturity periods for the originated financial assets
and liabilities affecting liquidity and through the ongoing
use of interest rate derivatives. The liquidity risk is regularly
monitored on the basis of the budget planning. A syndicated
loan and appropriate liquidity provisions form a sufficient risk
buffer for unplanned payments. Counterparty risks exist in the
Group in respect to invested cash and cash equivalents and
in an amount equivalent to the positive fair value from exist-
ing derivatives and are exclusively conducted with a defined
group of banks with an impeccable credit rating. Within the
guidelines, a risk limit specified by the Bertelsmann Executive
Board has been issued for financial assets and derivatives
for each counterparty. Compliance with this limit is regularly
monitored by the Central Financial Department. The guidelines
concerning the investment of cash and cash equivalents are
continuously monitored and extended if necessary. Financial
investments are made on a short-term basis so that the invest-
ment volume can be reduced if the credit rating changes.
Overall, the financial market risks are estimated as low.

General Statement on the Risk Situation
The risks identified in the financial year 2018 are not endan-

gering. Neither are there any substantial risks discernible that
could threaten the existence of the Group.


--- Page 32 ---

The overall risk situation is slightly below the previous year’s
level. The major risks to the Group have not changed com-
pared to the previous year. In particular, possible loss of audi-
ence and market share at RTL Group, a changing market
environment, pricing and discounting risks, customer and
supplier relationship risks, and volatile economic develop-
ment still constitute the key Group challenges. However, as a
result of the diversification of Group businesses, there are no
concentration risks stemming from dependency on individual
business partners or products in either procurement or sales.
The Group's financial position is solid, with liquidity needs
covered by existing liquidity and available credit facilities.

Opportunity Management System

An efficient opportunity management system enables
Bertelsmann to secure its corporate success in the long term
and to exploit potential in an optimal way. Opportunities are
possible future developments or events that could result in a
positive deviation from outlook or objective for Bertelsmann.
The opportunity management system, like the RMS, is an inte-
gral component of the business processes and company deci-
sions. During the strategy and planning process, significant
opportunities are determined each year from the profit center
level upward, and then aggregated step by step at the division
and Group levels. By systematically recording them on several
reporting levels, opportunities that arise can be identified and
exploited at an early stage. This also creates an interdivisional
overview of Bertelsmann’s current opportunities. A review of
major changes in opportunities is conducted at the divisional
level every six months. In addition, the largely decentralized
opportunity management system is coordinated by central
departments in the Group in order to derive synergies through
targeted cooperation in the individual divisions. The inter-
divisional experience transfer is reinforced by regular meet-
ings of the GMC.

Opportunities

While the above-mentioned opportunities associated with
positive development may be accompanied by corresponding
risks, certain risks are entered into in order to be able to
exploit potential opportunities. This link to the key Group risks
offers strategic, operational, legal, regulatory and financial
opportunities for Bertelsmann.

Strategic opportunities can be derived primarily from
the Group’s four strategic priorities. Strengthening core
businesses, driving forward the digital transformation,
developing growth platforms and expanding in growth
regions constitute the most important long-term growth

opportunities for Bertelsmann (see the section “Strategy”).
In particular, there are opportunities in some cases for
exploiting synergies as a result of the strategic portfolio
expansions. There are individual operating opportunities in
the individual divisions in addition to the possibility of more
favorable economic development.

For RTL Group, a better-than-expected development of the TV
advertising markets and higher audience and advertising mar-
ket shares are major opportunities. Furthermore, the increas-
ing digitization and fragmentation of the media landscape are
opening up opportunities. Professionally produced content
can be distributed across multiple platforms nationally and
internationally. New revenue streams could be generated by
exploiting existing TV content across different platforms and
by creating native digital content. Also, with an increased
presence in the digital sector, RTL Group could increase online
video advertising sales on all devices and TV platforms and
establish pay models in the on-demand business. In this way,
new advertising sales could be generated through the offering
of new interactive or targeted forms of advertising (HbbTV,
IPTV or mobile television). As an established content producer
with a global presence, RTL Group could further expand its
digital distribution through multiplatform networks and digital
streaming platforms.

Penguin Random House is the world’s largest trade book
publisher. Its position enables the publishing group to attract
new authors and book projects to potentially grow its market
share. The group is well positioned to invest in new markets
and diverse content worldwide to take advantage of increas-
ing interest in long-form reading, and to thereby offer its
content to the widest possible readership. The digital evolu-
tion transforming book markets offers the potential for new
product development and for broader and more efficient mar-
keting channels. Digital audiobooks are experiencing growth
worldwide, while new technologies could make books more
appealing and bring book content to wider audiences. New
online tools and platforms are expanding opportunities for
author engagement with readers.

For Gruner + Jahr, a better development of the advertising
and sales markets represents significant opportunities. The
transformation is providing further opportunities due to the
development of new businesses related to the published
brands. There are opportunities for growth, particularly in
the development and expansion of digital activities and in
cooperation with other publishers and marketers. In terms
of marketing, G+J could gain new customers through new
forms of advertising in the online, mobile and video media
channels.

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2018 35

BMG'’s focus is on organic growth through the signing of
additional songwriter and artist clients. There may also be
opportunities for selective acquisitions of music rights cata-
logs. The growing market penetration of subscription-based
music streaming services offers significant opportunities to
expand the recorded music and music publishing market
internationally.

At Arvato, interdivisional cooperation and major projects can
provide additional opportunities for acquiring new custom-
ers. The global e-commerce market will continue its dynamic
growth over the next few years. Arvato could participate sig-
nificantly in this growth through new services, particularly
those offered by the Solution Groups SCM and Financial
Solutions. Further growth opportunities from the ongoing
digitization lie in the development of innovative IP-based and
cloud-based IT services.

The Bertelsmann Printing Group businesses may decline
less steeply through additional volumes of existing and new
customers. There could also be a further consolidation of
competitors, which could result in an additional strengthening
of Bertelsmann Printing Group's own market position.

The education business is being developed as Bertelsmann's
third earnings pillar, alongside the media and service busi-
nesses. A further shift away from traditional classroom-based
delivery methods toward online and skill-based training could
offer further growth opportunities for the education business.
The growing online education market also offers organic
growth opportunities for Bertelsmann Education Group busi-
nesses. For example, Relias has the potential to grow through
the expansion of employee assessment and data analytics
products, and through internationalization. Owing to the lack
of skilled workers and the ongoing demand for further educa-
tion in the technology sector, Udacity has an opportunity to
become a premium brand in the area of IT and technology
training.

For Bertelsmann Investments fund activities, there is the
opportunity to realize higher-than-expected profits, thanks
to increasing portfolio valuations or through the disposal of
investments.
The current innovation efforts detailed in the section
“Innovations” offer further potential opportunities for the
individual divisions.

36 Financial Information Combined Management Report

Other opportunities could arise from changes to the legal
and regulatory environment.

The financial opportunities are largely based on a favor-
able development of interest and exchange rates from
Bertelsmann’s point of view.

Outlook

Anticipated Overall Economic Development

Bertelsmann anticipates that economic conditions will develop
as follows in 2019. The global economy is expected to continue
to grow in 2019, although less strongly than in the previous
year. Due to the higher utilization of overall capacities in most
economies, slower growth is anticipated. The Kiel Institute for
the World Economy (IfWV) estimates that global production will
increase by 3.4 percent in 2019, compared to 3.7 percent in
2018. Risks to economic development are present especially
in the eurozone, due to the looming disorderly withdrawal of
the United Kingdom from the EU. In addition, the insecurity
caused by a possible escalation of international trade conflicts
impacts the outlook.

In the eurozone, the economic upturn will probably continue,
although somewhat less dynamically. The IfW estimates
real economic growth of 1.7 percent in 2019. The IfW
also expects GDP for Germany to grow by 1.7 percent in
real terms. The growth rate in France is expected to be
1.4 percent in real terms. For the United Kingdom, GDP
is expected to rise at a slower pace: by 1.0 percent in real
terms in 2019. For the United States, real economic growth
of 2.5 percent is expected, thanks to the continuing solid
economic momentum.

Anticipated Development in Relevant Markets

The worldwide media industry is primarily influenced by
global economic developments and the resulting growth
dynamic. The continued trend toward digitization of content
and distribution channels, changes in media usage and the
increasing influence of emerging economies will continue to
present risks and opportunities in the years to come. Through
the intended transformation of the Group portfolio in line with
the four strategic priorities, Bertelsmann expects to benefit
to an increasing extent from the resulting opportunities.


--- Page 34 ---

Through its businesses, Bertelsmann operates in a variety
of different markets and regions whose developments are
subject to a range of factors and that do not respond in a
linear fashion to overall economic tendencies. The following
takes into account only those markets and regions that
are large enough to be relevant for forecasting purposes
and whose expected development can be appropriately
aggregated and evaluated or that are strategically important
from a Group perspective.

For 2019, the European TV advertising markets are expected
to remain stable or to grow slightly. In the book markets,
an overall stable development is expected. In the magazine
business, the strong decline in the print advertising and the
significant decline in circulation markets in Germany and
France will persist in 2019, while continued strong growth
is expected in the digital segment in Germany. For 2019,
continuing moderate growth of the global music market
is expected in the publishing rights segment. At the same
time, significant growth is anticipated in the recording rights
segment. In 2019, the services markets are demonstrating
growth similar to the previous year, as expected. The gravure
printing market in 2019 is likely to show an ongoing significant
decline. Continued moderate decline is expected for the offset
market in Europe, while the book printing market in North
America is expected to continue its stable development.
Overall, sustained strong growth is anticipated for the relevant
US education markets.

Expected Business Development

The following expectations are based on the assumption of a
gradual normalization of the overall economic situation and an
assumption that most of the forecasted market developments
and the economic predictions of the research institutions will
be realized.

For the financial year 2019, Bertelsmann anticipates that
business development will be driven by the stable European
TV advertising and book markets, and by growing service and
music markets. The growth stimuli created through strategic
portfolio expansions will continue to have a positive impact on
Bertelsmann’s growth profile.

In addition to the assumed market developments, the
predicted economic developments in the geographic core
markets of Western Europe and the United States are the

basis of the expected business development. With revenue
and earnings share within the eurozone currently expected
at around two-thirds, the extent of growth is above all based
on the forecasted real and nominal economic development
in this economic zone. The IfW therefore predicts that GDP
in the eurozone will increase by 1.7 percent in real terms
and that the International Monetary Fund will increase by
1.6 percent for 2019. In view of these economic expecta-
tions, Bertelsmann expects Group revenues to show a mod-
erate increase in the financial year 2019. Operating EBITDA is
expected to grow strongly in the financial year 2019. Applica-
tion of the new IFRS 16 Leases will have a substantial effect
on EBITDA (further details are presented in the notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in the section “Impact of
New Financial Reporting Standards”). Excluding this effect,
a stable to slightly increasing performance is expected for
the operating EBITDA. The average level of capital invested
will continue to increase in the financial year 2019 as a
result of acquisitions made, the organic expansion of growth
businesses and the effects of the new IFRS 16. Compen-
sating effects from earnings contributions are not expected
to materialize for some time. Consequently, a strong fall in
BVA is still expected for the Group. These expectations are
based on operational planning and the medium-term outlook
for the corporate divisions, assuming that exchange rates
remain constant.

At present, the expected performance of any individual unit of
key significance for the Bertelsmann Group is not expected to
deviate significantly from that of the Group.

Depending on how the economy develops, Bertelsmann does
not currently anticipate interest rate changes to have any
material impact on the average financing costs of medium-
to long-term financing. The liquidity situation in the forecast
period is expected to be sufficient.

These forecasts are based on Bertelsmann’s business strat-
egy, as outlined in the section “Corporate Profile.” In gen-
eral, the forecasts reflect careful consideration of risks and
opportunities. All statements concerning potential economic
and business developments represent opinions advanced
on the basis of the information that is currently available.
Should underlying assumptions fail to apply and/or further
risks arise, actual results may differ from those expected.
Accordingly, no assurances can be provided concerning the
accuracy of such statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA (in accordance with
HGB, German Commercial Code)

In addition to the Group reporting, the business develop-
ment of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is outlined below.
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is the parent company and group
holding company of the Bertelsmann Group. As a group hold-
ing company, it exercises key corporate functions such as the
definition and further development of group strategy, capital
allocation, financing and management. There are also ser-
vice functions for individual divisions within the Corporate
Center. Furthermore, it is the controlling company of the tax
group for most of the domestic subsidiaries. The position of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is essentially determined by the
business success of the Bertelsmann Group.

The Annual Financial Statements of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA,
in contrast to the Consolidated Financial Statements, have not
been prepared in accordance with the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) but in accordance with the regula-
tions of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the supple-
mentary regulations of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

Results of Operations of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA

The results of operations of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
will continue to be significantly affected by the amount of

income from other participations, due to Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA’s role as the parent company of the Bertelsmann
Group. The decrease in net income to €306 million (previous
year: €363 million) is primarily attributable to lower other
operating income and higher write-downs of long-term
financial assets. In contrast, higher income from other par-
ticipations and lower taxes on income impacted net income
favorably.

Other operating income decreased by €109 million as a result
of lower write-ups recognized on the shares in Bertelsmann
Inc., Wilmington, and lower currency gains. The increase of
€194 million in other operating expenses to €245 million is
primarily attributable to higher currency losses.

Given that expenses from loss assumption have increased,
the trend in the income from participations from
€687 million in the previous year to €759 million in 2018
is primarily attributable to higher income from profit and
loss transfer agreements. Firstly, these changes are related
to changes in the income from participations recognized
by subsidiaries. Secondly, the income from subsidiaries
is negatively impacted by non-recurring expenses in the
2018 financial year.

The higher write-downs of long-term financial assets mainly
pertain to write-downs of shares in Media Communication
S.A.S., Vendin-Le-Vieil.

The taxes on income decreased to €-111 million in the 2018
financial year (previous year: €-198 million) as a result of
lower taxable income of the tax group.

Net Assets and Financial Position of Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA

The total assets of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA increased
slightly from €21,182 million to €21,871 million. A high ratio of
equity (44 percent) and long-term financial assets (78 percent)
to total assets continues to dictate the performance of the net
assets and financial position.

The increase in long-term financial assets is due in part to con-
tributions paid to subsidiaries in the amount of €514 million,
which are primarily related to Bertelsmann Capital Holding
GmbH, Gitersloh. This was partly offset by the repayment of
a loan in the amount of €142 million by Bertelsmann, Inc.,
Wilmington. The increase in receivables and other assets is
related to the financing of capital contributions to subsidiaries
by Reinhard Mohn GmbH, Gutersloh.

The equity increased as a result of the net income of the
reporting year by €306 million and decreased by €180 million
as a result of distributions to shareholders. The increase in
liabilities to €11,767 million (previous year: €11,177 million)
includes €550 million from bonds and promissory notes as

a result of issuing one new bond and the repayment of a
promissory note.

Risks and Opportunities for Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA

As Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is largely linked to the
Bertelsmann Group companies, among other things through
the financing and guarantee commitments, as well as through
direct and indirect investments in the subsidiaries, the situation
of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA in terms of risks and opportu-
nities is primarily dependent on the risks and opportunities of
the Bertelsmann Group. In this respect, the statements made
by corporate management concerning the overall assessment
of the risks and opportunities also constitute a summary of the
risks and opportunities of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA (see the
section “Risks and Opportunities”).

Outlook for Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA

As the parent company of the Bertelsmann Group,
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA receives from its subsidiaries
dividend distributions and income or expenses from profit
and loss transfer agreements, as well as income from services
provided to its subsidiaries. Consequently, the performance
of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA is primarily determined by
the business performance of the Bertelsmann Group (see the
section “Outlook”).

Dependent Company Report (statement in accordance with
Section 312 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG))

The Executive Board of Bertelsmann Management SE, as general
partner of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA, has submitted a voluntary
report to the Supervisory Board of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
in accordance with sections 278 (3) and 312 (1) of the German
Stock Corporation Act, in which it outlines its relationships with
affiliated companies for the financial year 2018. The Executive
Board hereby declares that Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA
received adequate consideration in return for each and every
legal transaction under the circumstances known at the time the
transactions were undertaken.

Combined Non-Financial Statement

The following information relates to Bertelsmann SE &
Co. KGaA and the Bertelsmann Group (“Bertelsmann”) with its
incorporated, fully consolidated subsidiaries (“subsidiaries”)
in accordance with sections 315b and 315c of the HGB in
conjunction with sections 289b to 289e of the HGB.

Bertelsmann operates in the core business fields of media,
services and education in around 50 countries (cf. section
“Company Profile”). Responsible conduct — in business,
toward employees, in society and in dealing with the environ-
ment — is firmly anchored in Bertelsmann’s corporate culture.
In its corporate responsibility management, Bertelsmann pur-
sues the goal of reconciling commercial interests with social
and environmental concerns within the Group and beyond.

For the purpose of identifying relevant topics and describing
concepts, the GRI Standards 2016 specified by the Global
Reporting Initiative (in particular standards 102 and 103)
were used to produce the Group Non-Financial Statement. In
addition, voluntary CR-reporting based on the GRI Standards
(2016; Option “core”) will be published by the middle of the
financial year.

Company Principles and Guidelines

The prerequisites for a corporate culture in which employees,
management and shareholders work together successfully,
respectfully and in a spirit of trust are common goals and shared
values. These are enshrined in the corporate constitution and
in the Bertelsmann Essentials. Furthermore, the Bertelsmann
Code of Conduct — as a binding guideline — defines standards

40 Financial Information Combined Management Report

for law-abiding and ethically responsible conduct within
the company and toward business partners and the public.
The sense of purpose embodied in the triad “To Empower.
To Create. To Inspire.” also provides orientation for the
company’s staff and partners.

Bertelsmann’s actions are also determined by external guide-
lines. The company largely follows the recommendations
of the German Corporate Governance Code for good and
responsible corporate governance, and the OECD Guidelines
for Multinational Enterprises. Bertelsmann is committed to the
principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights, and the International Labor Organization core labor
standards. Bertelsmann has been a signatory of the United
Nations Global Compact since 2008.

Corporate Responsibility Management
Organization

The advisory body for the strategic development of corpo-
rate responsibility at Bertelsmann is the CR Council. The CR
Council, which is made up of the Chief Human Resources
Officer (CHRO) and representatives from the corporate divi-
sions, focuses on the Group-wide CR objectives in line with
the corporate strategy and the cross-divisional coordination of
CR activities within the Group.

At the Group level, the Corporate Responsibility & Diversity
Management department coordinates and supports the work
of the CR Council in close cooperation with the other Group
functions. Within the decentralized Bertelsmann corporate
structure, the local management teams are responsible for
implementing corporate responsibility through specific CR
measures and projects. The corporate divisions and compa-
nies have their own structures and processes in place for this,
in accordance with local requirements.

Topics

To identify key CR topics, Bertelsmann carries out regular
CR relevance analyses. The current analysis was finalized
in early 2018. For this analysis, the company conducted a
survey of internal and external stakeholders. The external
stakeholders estimated the impact of Bertelsmann’s busi-
ness activity on the topics, while the internal stakeholders
assessed their business relevance. This made it possible
to identify topics of relevance to Bertelsmann relating to
environmental, social and employee matters, and respect


--- Page 38 ---

for human rights, anti-corruption and bribery matters. These
topics are analyzed within the company boundaries, unless
otherwise stated.

CR topics, including non-financial performance indicators, are
not directly relevant to business, and are accordingly not part
of Bertelsmann’s value-oriented management system. Due
to currently only limited measurability, no directly quantifi-
able statements can be made regarding relevant interdepen-
dencies and value increases for the Group. For this reason,
the non-financial performance indicators are not used for
the management of the Group (cf. section “Value-Oriented
Management System”).

Risks

A number of risks associated with CR topics is relevant for
Bertelsmann. These risks can arise from the company’s own
business activities or from its business relationships, and can
affect the company or its environment and stakeholders.

For the non-financial matters defined in the German Commer-
cial Code — social and employee matters, anti-corruption and
bribery matters, respect for human rights and environmental
matters — no significant risks were identifiable as part of the
2018 reporting.

For more information on the relevant risks, please see the
section “Risks and Opportunities.”

Employee Matters

Motivated employees ensure long-term quality, innovation
and growth. HR work at Bertelsmann is therefore based on the
company’s cooperative identity as codified in the corporate
constitution and the Bertelsmann Essentials. Supplementary
regulations are specified in the Bertelsmann Code of
Conduct and the Executive Board guidelines on HR work.
The CHRO is primarily responsible for dealing with employee
matters within the company. He works closely with the HR
managers from the corporate divisions who report directly to
him via a dotted-line concept. The focus of his work includes
setting the strategic HR agenda, continual development of
company partnerships, aligning management development
with the Group's strategic priorities, managing recruitment
and compensation processes for key Group positions, and
standardizing and providing IT support for important HR
processes. In 2018, measures were taken to address the
following topics.

Participation

Bertelsmann sees continual dialogue between employees
and company management as a fundamental prerequisite to
the company's success. Although Bertelsmann, as a media
company, is free to determine its political direction as defined
in the German Works Constitutions Act (Tendenzschutz) and
therefore is not subject to statutory co-determination in the
Supervisory Board, company employees nevertheless nomi-
nate five members to serve on the Supervisory Board of
Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA on a voluntary basis: four of
these are works council members and one is a member of
the Bertelsmann Management Representative Committee. In
addition, managers, general workforce, employees with dis-
abilities and trainees all have platforms for exchanging ideas,
advancing topics and voicing their concerns. The Bertelsmann
Group Dialogue Conference is an event where the CEO, CHRO
and members of the Corporate Works Council can exchange
ideas. Employees are also involved in the development and
improvement of working conditions through standardized
HR interview tools (Performance and Development Dialogue,
Agreements on Objectives, Team Talk), as well as Group-wide
employee surveys. In 2018 the company pressed ahead on
digitization and focus of employee surveys and made prepara-
tions for the next survey in 2019.

Learning

Highly trained employees are needed to overcome major
challenges such as the Group’s increasingly international
focus, the digital transformation of media and services, and
demographic change. By providing opportunities for lifelong
learning, Bertelsmann helps to secure the long-term employ-
ability of its employees. With four different campuses —
Strategy, Leadership, Function and Individual — Bertelsmann
University is the central learning organization within the com-
pany. The most important measures implemented in 2018
included the further development of international programs
in the areas of leadership, strategy and transformation, and
formats on the topics of creativity and entrepreneurship. In
addition to developing new HR programs, an international
scholarship program in data science was introduced in 2018.
Content of the training and courses offered by Bertelsmann
in Germany was expanded to include new challenges in the
workplace.

Diversity
For Bertelsmann, diversity of its workforce is a prerequisite

for creativity, innovation and long-term business success.
The Bertelsmann Diversity Statement adopted in 2018

Bertelsmann Annual Report 2018 4)


--- Page 39 ---

also emphasized this stance. The diversity strategy is
implemented by the Corporate Responsibility & Diversity
Management department with support from a Group-wide
working group. The focus is on “Gender,” “Generations” and
“Nationality.” The Group Management Committee, which
currently consists of 18 members (previous year: 17), includes
6 women (previous year: 6) and 7 nationalities (previous
year: 6). To further increase diversity at the management
levels, Bertelsmann has sought since 2017 to increase
the percentage of women in the talent pools to one-third
(Top Management Pool, Senior Management Pool, Career
Development Pool). Additional topics are inclusion and sexual
orientation and identity. As part of this initiative, work began
in 2018 to create a Bertelsmann Inclusion Action Plan and to
roll out diversity training courses.

Health

With a view to designing a health-promoting work environment
and preventing work-related risks of disease, Bertelsmann
is expanding a systematic health management system at
German locations. Bertelsmann Health Management has
been put in charge of supervising and coordinating the
Germany-wide health strategy and associated activities,
in conjunction with a cross-functional strategy group. The
cross-divisional “Health Community,” which is comprised
of health experts, works council chairs, Supervisory Board
members, HR managers and representatives for employees
with disabilities, plays a key role here. Through targeted
networking, it also helps to reinforce uniform standards
for all German locations. In 2018, another working group
was created to accelerate the implementation of health
management in the companies.

Fair Working Conditions

At Bertelsmann, remuneration issues are an essential part of
the topic of fair working conditions. The policy is to establish
consistent and transparent remuneration structures in the
Group. The design of the compensation system is intended
to ensure that remuneration is driven by market, function
and performance, taking into account business-specific
characteristics. Employee profit sharing in Germany is based
on the same criteria as those used to calculate variable
remuneration components for Executive Board members
and executives. This includes Bertelsmann and subsidiaries
based in Germany, with the exception of RTL Group and
Gruner + Jahr. These and many foreign subsidiaries have
similar success and profit-sharing models adapted to local
requirements. In 2018, a total of €105 million of the 2017
profit was distributed as part of such schemes.

42 Financial Information Combined Management Report

Social Matters

Corporate citizenship is one of the Bertelsmann Essentials and
is thus firmly anchored in Bertelsmann’s corporate culture.
As a good corporate citizen, Bertelsmann is committed to
contributing to society and implemented measures in the
following areas in 2018.

Creative Independence

Bertelsmann stands for editorial and journalistic independence
as well as for freedom of the press and artistic license.
Bertelsmann publishes a wide variety of opinions and
positions. These basic principles for business activities are
set forth in the Bertelsmann Code of Conduct. Bertelsmann
interprets this independence in two directions: Inside the
company, it means that our management does not attempt
to influence the decisions of artists, editors and program
managers, or to restrict their artistic or editorial freedom. In
accordance with the Bertelsmann “Editor-in-chief Principle,”
editorial decisions are the sole responsibility of the content
managers. To the outside, this means that the company does
not capitulate to political or economic influence in its coverage,
and complies with existing laws regarding the separation of
editorial content and commercial advertising. The result is
that the company expects careful research and qualitative
reporting, unaffected by fake news and online disinformation.
In addition to the Bertelsmann Code of Conduct, many
subsidiaries and their editors and creative departments in
2018 continued to implement their own statutes and rules to
safeguard editorial and artistic independence in their day-to-
day business and to develop these further where necessary.
These statutes focus primarily on duties of care, respect for
privacy, and dealing with the representation of violence and
the protection of minors.

Content Responsibility

Bertelsmann reflects on the repercussions of the content it
produces and distributes to protect the rights and interests of
media users, customers and third parties as far as possible.
Overriding principles and guidelines of media ethics are
set by national and international laws governing the press,
broadcasting and multimedia; by voluntary commitments
to external guidelines such as the ethics codes of national
press councils; and within the company by the Bertelsmann
Code of Conduct and editorial statutes. In accordance with
these principles and guidelines, Bertelsmann’s editorial staff
are committed to, among other things, “respecting privacy
and the responsible treatment of information, opinion and
images.” In accordance with the “Editor-in-chief Principle,”


--- Page 40 ---

the responsibility for media content lies solely with the
content managers in the local editorial teams and creative
departments.

In the area of youth media protection, content is monitored
at Bertelsmann in accordance with different restrictions for
each medium and region to see if it could adversely affect the
development of children or young people. In this case, vari-
ous restrictions come into force, such as broadcasting time
restrictions or content and/or product labels. Through volun-
tary labeling systems Bertelsmann sometimes goes beyond
the existing European and national regulations, particularly in
the broadcasting industry. Other specifications relating to con-
tent responsibility are agreed through supplementary statutes
at divisional, company and editorial level.

Customer Data Protection

Bertelsmann attaches great importance to protecting
customer data. This includes safeguarding the personal
data of individual customers, as well as information about
customers that is provided to Bertelsmann by its business
partners. The objective of customer data protection is to
protect an individual's right to determine who acquires
what knowledge about them, and when. This also means
that personal information, or information that could identify
a person, must be handled in accordance with legal
requirements and adequately protected against unauthorized
access. In addition to the Bertelsmann Code of Conduct,
customer data protection within the company is regulated
by Executive Board guidelines on the topics of information
security and IT risk management.

The Executive Board Guideline on Data Protection addresses
the data protection framework conditions at Bertelsmann
Group based on the European Union's General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect on
May 25, 2018, and is designed to ensure consistent data
protection management across the Bertelsmann Group.
A data protection management system has been in place
since 2017. It addresses in particular implementation of the
documentation and accountability obligations under GDPR,
as well as regulations concerning governance obligations.

Responsibility for customer data protection is decentralized
and rests with the management of the individual subsidiaries.
To ensure compliance with local laws governing customer
data protection, the subsidiaries in Germany have a data
protection organization consisting of central data protection
officers and local data protection coordinators. The latter
report to the local management, as well as annually or on an

event-driven basis to the central data protection officers, who
in turn report to the Bertelsmann Executive Board. A similar
organization exists in subsidiaries outside Germany. An
information security management system (ISMS) based on
industry-standard ISO 27001 creates the technical framework
for confidential data processing. The ISMS features a regular
and structured survey to ensure compliance with statutory
information security requirements, a systematic recording of
risks and the derivation of related mitigation measures.

Protecting Intellectual Property

Bertelsmann’s businesses develop, produce, transfer, license,
and sell products and services that are protected as intellec-
tual property. For Bertelsmann, the protection of intellectual
property rights is the foundation of its business success. For
this reason, the company is committed to a high level of global
copyright protection worldwide and in the digital world. The
Group-wide Taskforce Copyright, with representatives from
the relevant corporate divisions, supports current develop-
ments in copyright and summarizes its positions in the form
of joint papers.

Respect for Human Rights

Through its corporate principles and its voluntary commitment
to external guidelines, Bertelsmann is committed to respecting
and protecting human rights within the company and in
its business relationships. For this reason, the Bertelsmann
Executive Board established an Integrity & Compliance program
and appointed a Corporate Compliance Committee (CCC). The
CCC submits an annual Compliance Report to the Bertelsmann
Executive Board and the Audit and Finance Committee. The
Integrity & Compliance (l&C) department was created to
manage the ongoing day-to-day work and is subordinated to
the CCC in the organization. |&C supports the CCC in fulfilling
its tasks and makes suggestions for necessary improvements
to the I&C program. I&C ensures that employees worldwide are
made aware of the key legal provisions and internal company
guidelines, including those concerning the respect for human
rights, and it implemented the training and communication
measures necessary for this in 2018.

Respect for human rights, also within the supply chain, is
expressly stipulated by the Bertelsmann Code of Conduct
and the Supplier Code of Conduct. This includes the ban
on child and coercive labor and the ban on discrimination
and intimidation, and it reaffirms the right to freedom of
association and the right to engage in collective bargaining. In

addition, individual subsidiaries and Bertelsmann itself issued
statements in 2018 in accordance with the “UK Modern Slavery
Act” that condemn all forms of modern slavery, coercive and
child labor, and exploitation and discrimination, and present
measures to prevent these human rights violations. These
statements are revised each year (if required). At Bertelsmann,
violations of this principle may be reported by employees and
by third parties via the reporting channels within the existing
compliance management system.

In terms of anti-discrimination, contact persons for Germany's
“General Equal Treatment Act” (AGG) have been appointed
at all German locations. Employees can contact them in the
event of suspected breaches of said act. The employees are
informed of their rights under the AGG and given correspond-
ing training through a wide range of communication chan-
nels. The topic of anti-discrimination was addressed in a
Group-wide e-learning program designed to build employee
awareness of the issue and advise them of their rights. These
activities were continually refined and expanded in 2018.

Anti-corruption and Bribery Matters

Both the Bertelsmann Code of Conduct and the Bertelsmann
Executive Board Guideline on Anti-corruption and Integrity
expressly prohibit all forms of corruption and bribery. This
prohibition also applies to all third parties that work for, with or
on behalf of Bertelsmann, as stipulated in the Supplier Code of
Conduct. Along with instructions for dealing with officials, and
guidelines for the granting or accepting of gifts in the context of
business relations, the Anti-corruption and Integrity Guideline
prescribes appropriate due diligence processes in dealing with
third parties. An appropriate due diligence review is carried out
for each individual risk profile through a corresponding risk
classification. This Executive Board guideline also describes
the channels for reporting suspected violations and seeking
advice, as well as other prevention and control measures. The
Executive Board guideline for dealing with alleged compliance
violations anchors an obligation to report suspected violations
of the prohibition of corruption to the Bertelsmann Corporate
Center. The topic of corruption prevention is globally managed
and further developed by the I&C department. One of the
most important measures in 2018 was advising and training
executives and employees on anti-corruption and the continued
Group-wide rollout of the new e-learning program on this topic
conceived in 2017.

Fair Competition and Antitrust Law

Bertelsmann is committed to the principle of fair competi-
tion and condemns antitrust violations and anticompeti-
tive behavior. The company acts against any contravention
and consults internal or external experts on antitrust and
competition issues. The Bertelsmann Executive Board has
approved a “Group Guideline for Compliance with Antitrust
Regulations.” There is an obligation to report any antitrust
violations. The Corporate Legal Department offers antitrust
training programs to corporate divisions and the manage-
ment and employees of these divisions. A comprehensive
compulsory training program for employees working in
antitrust-related areas, which was also implemented in 2018,
is intended to identify antitrust risks at an early stage and to
prevent antitrust violations.

Environmental Matters

The Bertelsmann Environmental Policy and the Bertelsmann
Paper Policy provide guidelines for Group-wide responsible
use of natural resources and environmentally friendly energy
and material procurement. The environmental commitment
extends beyond the individual locations to the supply chain,
in particular by selecting and influencing paper suppliers
and energy firms. Operational responsibility for energy and
environmental management, as well as for implementing
measures, is decentralized and rests with the management
of the individual companies. The international “be green”
Working Group with representatives from the Bertelsmann
corporate divisions again provided a platform for cross-
divisional exchange on environmental topics in 2018. The
cooperation will focus on increasing the use of paper from
certified or recycled sources and reducing greenhouse gas
emissions from the consumption of energy, heat and fuels.
Experts from the “be green” Working Group also coordinate
the annual collection of key environmental figures, which
creates transparency about impacts on the environment
and climate and Bertelsmann’s environmental performance,
and enable the management to derive measures for
improvement. In 2018, in parts of the Group, the annual
environmental data collection was conducted for the first
time with an |T-supported environmental platform, and
preparations were made for a rollout in other divisions. The
Group-wide environmental key figures are published on the
Bertelsmann website.
