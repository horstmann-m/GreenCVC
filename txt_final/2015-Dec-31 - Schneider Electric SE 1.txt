TRENDS IN SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC’S CORE MARKETS

> 1. Trends in Schneider Electric’s

core markets

1.1 Industries and machine manufacturers

Industry market struggled throughout 2015,
headwinds:

facing severe

Falling commodity prices (mainly O&G, metals) have led a sharp
drop in commodity sectors capex. This step down has generated
strong negative impacts on global industry market: O&G sector is
one of the first end-users in metals, construction engines, turbines,
water treatment and professional services. Companies exposed to
this O&G supply chain cut their own capex, opex and inventories to
align them with lower demand.

Companies which benefited from lower energy costs were reluctant
to invest, given the generally weak economic environment,

overcapacities and high level of debt. Companies preferred
to restore the balance sheet, or to reduce selling prices (due to
increasing competitive pressure).

In China, industrial production and manufacturing investment
have slowed markedly, depressed by deterioration in global trade,
overcapacities and decrease in construction sector (which is the
largest end-user of heavy industry).

In other new economies, industrial markets recorded a slowdown
on the back of lower commodity prices, declining demand from
China, capital outflow and a high level of debt.

1.2__Nonresidential and residential buildings

Non residential buildings

In the US, non residential market growth slowed down in 2015.
Manufacturing buildings reported strong growth thanks to the
chemicals and transportation equipment sectors. Construction
in the office and retail sectors decelerated. Institutional buildings
segments slightly rebounded in 2015, driven by the private sector
component (mainly in healthcare facilities) as public spending
remained under pressure.

In Western Europe, non residential construction remained sluggish
in 2015. Manufacturing, office and commercial buildings suffered
from the deteriorated global economic environment. Education and
healthcare segments were constrained by public-sector austerity.
Non residential construction declined in two major markets,
Germany and France. Spain and Ireland increased, benefiting from
economic reforms. In Italy, the market stabilized after several years
of decline.

In China, non residential construction decreased further. The main
reasons were the economic slowdown and new consumption
patterns (e-commerce has a major negative impact on commercial
buildings).

In Australia, non residential construction declined. Industrial, office
and commercial buildings all fall as well as social & institutional
buildings (marked by a sharp plunge in the Health segment).

In several new economies, non residential construction was
hampered by several headwinds: lower demand from China,
negative impact from lower oil and commodities prices on the

178 2015 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC

revenues of commodity exporter countries, currency depreciation
and capital outflow.

Non residential activity accelerated in in India thanks to improvement
in the regulatory and financing environment.

Residential

Residential markets marginally decreased in 2015, with varied
positions among major regional blocks.

In the US, residential construction increase, driven by multi-family
market.

In Western Europe, market improved gently. France, Italy and
Denmark recorded a decline. Germany and Great Britain grew
slightly whereas Ireland and the Netherlands surged.

In China, residential construction continued to fall. At end of 2013,
China's property sector had reached a turning point, due to strong
construction oversupply and lower demand for property. Despite
a gradual improvement in housing sales in 2015, developers have
continued to reduce housing starts in order to reduce inventory.

In other new economies, residential market declined as a whole.
Residential construction has dropped, notably in Russia, Ukraine,
Brazil and Venezuela, hit by gloomy economic situation and weak
consumer confidence. On the contrary, Asian new economies and
Africa continued to grow in 2015.

1.3. Utilities and Infrastructures

Electrical Utilities

In generation, renewables continued their expansion in 2015, fuelled
by on-going cost declines. Wind and solar rapid growth spread to
new territories in emerging countries. At the end of the year, COP21
was the confirmation that electric utilities have to engage in a path to
decarbonise their mix. Also that in this new energy world of energy
efficiency they have to re-think their business models, strengthen
their networks and digitize their operations.

In networks, investments were thus sustained and those in software
and smart grids accelerated.

However pressure from regulators, investors and consumers did
not relieve, driving operations and asset the optimisations projects
across the board.

These trends will positively affect Schneider Electric, widening its
market for grid modernization or asset and operations management
solutions. For a given capacity of power generation, renewables,
with their often distributed nature, offer a larger accessible market
for Schneider Electric products and solutions. They also imply a
transformation of the system as a whole, opening new realms, for
example in demand management.

Oil and Gas

The year 2015 has seen a normal demand growth (around
+1,2%), and supply growing and still higher than demand by about
+1.5mb/d. As a consequence crude and refined products stocks
are continuing to pile up. The North American unconventional
production has further increased through most of the year, to
eventually start a gradual decrease of 0,1mb/d per month.
Increased productivity and cost cuttings and previous upstream
investments have enabled many operators to continue producing,
despite the low barrel prices. Saudi Arabia continues its race for
market share. lran now authorized back in the game may add half
a million barrels per day (0,5% world production) could increase
further tension on supply.

This surplus situation has led most upstream players to significantly
cut their investment in 2015, in particular in exploration. Similar cuts
have been announced for 2016. These two consecutive years of
upstream spending cuts could be considered as a new normal to
a new level around USD500 billion a year, after 4 years of hyper-
inflation

with Our Solutions and Digital Services portfolio.

Our value strategy based on - Solutions, Services , Software and
Digital Services- toward Strategic majors considering business
transformation through innovation and optimized architectures
should support further resilience of Schneider Electric Oil ,Gas and
Petrochem activity.

Data centers and Networks

The global IT market experienced slow but steady growth in 2015
partly due to the worsened economic environment in emerging
markets.

Our transactional single phase market remained soft, as the
demand of Small & Medium Business (SBM) for power protection
products for servers and PC continued to stagnate. Growth in Asia
and Europe was offset by the weakness in Russia, Latin America
and China.

Large Enterprises continued to deploy IT in a hybrid environment
of on-premise, colocation, hosting and cloud in 2015. Due to data
sovereignty and privacy concerns and regional demand for data
center capacity, an increasing number of hyperscale data centers
are being built in the North America market and in various locations
in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Schneider Electric is leveraging
its global presence and comprehensive data center solutions to
accommodate our customer needs wherever they decide to locate
their IT infrastructure.

As internet use is trending towards bandwidth-intensive content
and the increasing adoption of the « Internet of Things », computing
power and storage is increasingly placed at the edge of the network
closer to end users. The IT business is well positioned to penetrate
in various edge computing applications with its micro data center
and modular data center offers.

Industrial markets achieved steady growth along with a moderate
outlook for infrastructure investments in power generation, chemical
production and semiconductor.

The year of 2015 also marked the initial commercialization of energy
storage solutions for home, commercial buildings, datacenters
and _ utilities. Schneider Electric entered the lithium ion energy
storage market with the presentation of Ecoblade™ at the COP21
Conference on Climate Change in Paris in December 2015.
The Ecoblade solution combines advanced software analytics,
modularity, and IT-style server designs in a smart battery that can
scale up from 1kw to more than 1MW for homes, commercial
buildings and utility substations.

REVIEW OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

> 2. Reviewof the consolidated
financial statements

2:1 Review of business and consolidated statement of income

Changes in the scope of consolidation
Acquisitions & divestments occurred during the year

On December 11, 2015, Schneider Electric announced that it had
obtained all required regulatory approvals and subsequently finalized
the sale of Juno Lighting, LLC (« Juno ») to Acuity Brands, Inc. for
a consideration of approximately USD385 million (EUR343 million).
The transaction generated a capital loss of EUR163 million recorded
as Other operating expense.

On December 14, 2015, Schneider Electric announced that it has
signed an agreement to sell its Transportation Business, to Kapsch
TrafficCom AG. The Transportation business generated revenues
of EUR134 million in 2014 and is currently consolidated under
the Infrastructure business of Schneider Electric. The terms of the
agreement reflect a purchase price of about EUR35 million on a
cash-free, debt-free basis. The agreement is conditioned upon the
satisfaction of certain regulatory conditions and on other customary
closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the
coming months. The transaction would generate an impairment
of EUR100 million that was recognized at December 31, 2015 as
Other operating expense.

No significant acquisition occurred during 2015.

Acquisitions & divestments occurred in 2014
with significant effect in 2015 ©

On January 17, 2014, the Group took control of Invensys group.
Invensys is fully consolidated, mainly in the Industry business,
since January 2014, except for its Appliance division (divested in
June 2014) reported as discontinued operation over the first half
of 2014.

On October 1, 2014 the Group finalized the sale of Custom
Sensors & Technologies (CST) and the Group has reinvested
approximately USD100 million alongside CST management to hold
a shareholding of 30% of CST. CST was reported in the Industry
Business of Schneider Electric. The CST activity was reclassified
as discontinued operations in Group's consolidated financial
statements from January to September 30, 2014 (for EUR24 million
net income). From October 1, 2014 and for full year 2015, the 30%
of CST share is accounted for by the equity method.

Changes in foreign exchange rates

Changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the euro had a
material impact over the year. This positive effect amounts to
EUR1,949 million on consolidated revenue and to EUR254 million
on Adjusted EBITA ®.

Revenue

On December 31, 2015, the consolidated revenue of Schneider
Electric totalled EUR26,640 million, an increase of 6.8% at current
scope and exchange rates compared to EUR24,939 million on
December 31, 2014.

This variance breaks down into an organic decrease of -1.0%
and a positive exchange rate effect of 7.8%, primarily due to the
appreciation of the US dollar and Chinese yuan against the euro.

2.2 Changes in revenue by operating segment

The Buildings & Partner business generated revenues of
EUR11,859 million, or 45% of the consolidated total. This represents
an increase of +10.3% on a reported basis and an increase of
+0.4% on a like-for-like basis. Buildings & Partner observed organic
growth across all regions except Asia Pacific. North America was
slightly up, driven by the growth in the construction market in the
US, helped by new product launches and increased cross-selling
and a recovery in Mexico. In Western Europe, Spain, Italy and the
U.K. grew, France performed well thanks to strong execution, while
Germany was down mainly due to a high base of comparison. Rest

of the World was up thanks to good project execution in the Middle
East and strong growth in Africa and Central Europe. Asia Pacific
was penalized by a weak construction market in China, despite
growth in the rest of the region.

The Industry business generated revenues of EUR5,696 million, or
21% of the consolidated total. This represents an increase of +2.6%
on areported basis and a decrease of -4.9% on a like-for-like basis.
Organic growth was impacted by strong headwinds from Oil & Gas
and China. Western Europe was flat, as the growth in Spain and

Italy driven by successful OEM offer launches in a favourable OEM
export market offset declines in Switzerland and the Nordics. North
America declined on weakness in industrial investments, notably in
Oil & Gas and lower export-oriented OEM demand due to a strong
dollar, and the focus remained on the improvement of the business
performance. Asia Pacific was penalized by weakness in China.
Rest of the world performed well.

The Infrastructure business generated revenues of EUR5,428 milion,
or 20% of the consolidated total. This represents an increase of
+2.9% on a reported basis and an increase of +0.3% on a like-for-
like basis. Western Europe grew, driven by growth in Spain, Italy and
the UK. Germany was down due to greater project selectivity. North
America was up thanks to project execution in Canada, while the US
was penalized by lower investment in Oil & Gas and delays in data
center investments, which more than offset the growth from targeted

initiatives. Asia-Pacific posted mixed trends with difficulties in China,
weak utility market in Australia and growth in East Asia and India. The
Rest of the World was up driven by project execution in the Middle
East, while Russia was weak. Services were strong, up high single-
digit.

The IT business generated revenues of EUR3,657 million, or
14% of the consolidated total. This represents an increase of
+8.9% on a reported basis and a decrease of -0.9% on a like-
for-like basis. The US was about flat, thanks to project execution
in a soft market. Western Europe was up, driven by successful
execution of commercial initiatives in a positive IT market. Asia
Pacific was dragged down by weakness in China and a high-base
of comparison in India. Rest of the World was down as weakness
in Russia more than offset the growth in the Middle East and Africa.
Services posted good growth.

Gross profit increased from EUR9,407 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014 to EUR9,845 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015, or +4.7%, mainly due to an increase in
productivity and actions on prices and a positive foreign exchange
translation effect. As a percentage of revenues, the gross margin

decreased to 37.0% in 2015 (versus 37.7% in 2014), as the positive
net pricing and productivity impacts partially offset the negative mix
effect, increased R&D depreciation and cost inflation.

2.4 Support Function Costs: research and development and selling, general

and administrative expenses

Research and development expenses, excluding capitalized
development costs and development costs reported as cost
of sales, decreased by 0.4% from EUR567 million for the year
ended December 31, 2014 to EUR565 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015. As a percentage of revenues, the net cost
of research and development decreased to 2.1% of revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2015 (2.3% for the year ended
December 31, 2014).

Total research and development expenses, including capitalized
development costs and development costs reported as cost of sales
(see note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) increased by
5.0% from EUR1,212 million for the year ended December 31, 2014
to EUR1,272 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a
percentage of revenues, total research and development expenses
remained stable at 4.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015
from 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014.

In 2015, the net effect of capitalized development costs and
amortization of capitalized development costs amounts to
EUR145 million on operating income versus EUR175 million in
2014.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 4.9%
from EUR5,377 million for the year ended December 31, 2014
to EUR5,639 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As
a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative
expenses decreased from 21.6% in 2014 to 21.2% in 2015

Combined total support function costs, that is, research and
development expenses together with selling, general and
administrative costs, totalled EUR6,204 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015 compared to EUR5,944 million for the year
ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 4.4%. The support
functions costs to sales ratio decreased from 23.8% for the
year ended December 31, 2014 to 23.3% for the year ended
December 31, 2015 reflecting progress in simplification initiatives.

2.5 Other operating income and expenses

For the year ended December 31, 2015, other operating income
and expenses amounted to a net loss of EUR522 million, mainly due
to net losses on sale of business (EUR228 million), notably on Juno
divestment, and impairment of assets (EUR246 million), notably
on Transportation business related to the expected divestment
described above. Other main items included costs linked to
acquisitions for EUR118 million (notably Invensys integration costs),
a EURS3 million gain on the curtailment of employee benefit plans
in the UK and in France.

2.6 Restructuring costs

For the year ended December 31, 2014, other operating income and
expenses amounted to a net expensee of EUR106 million, including
costs linked to acquisitions for EUR114 million, a EUR95 million
gain on the curtailment of employee benefit plans in the UK, in
France and in the US and miscellaneous other operating incomes
and expenses amounting to a net expense of EUR69 million. Costs
linked to acquisitions are acquisition, integration and separation
costs on 2014 and 2015 acquisitions, notably Invensys. Net other

amounted to EUR318 million compared to EUR202 million for the
year ended December 31, 2014. This increase in restructuring

2.7. EBITA and Adjusted EBITA

We define EBITA as earnings before interest, taxes and amortization
of purchase accounting intangibles. EBITA comprises operating
profit before amortization and impairment of purchase accounting
intangible assets and before goodwill impairment.

We define adjusted EBITA as EBITA before restructuring costs
and before other operating income and expenses, which includes
acquisition, integration and separation costs.

Adjusted EBITA amounted to EUR3,641 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015, compared to EUR3,463 million for the year
ended December 31, 2014, representing an increase of 5.1%, mainly
due to a favourable foreign exchange effect of EUR254 million. As a

percentage of revenue, adjusted EBITA decreased from 13.9% for
the year ended December 31, 2014 to 13.7% for the year ended
December 31, 2015.

EBITA decreased by 11.2% from EUR3,155 million for the year
ended December 31, 2014 to EUR2,801 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015, mainly linked to net losses on sales of business,
impairment of assets and higher restructuring expenses in 2015
that did offset the increase in Adjusted EBITA. As a percentage of
revenue, EBITA decreased to 10.5% in 2015 compared with 12.7%
in 2014, in line with the lower Adjusted EBITA margin and with
losses on sales of business, impairments and restructuring costs
higher than in 2014.

> 5. Outlook

In 2016 the Group sees continued growth in Western Europe and
the construction market in the US. At the same time, headwinds
from O&G, overall weakness in the US industry markets, difficulties
in China, though to a lesser degree than in 2015, and mixed trends
in the rest of new economies are expected. Additionally, given the
accelerated decline of several new economies’ currencies against
the euro in the end of 2015, the Group should also face a material
FX headwind in 2016.

In this context the Group's priorities are margin improvement by
working on costs, growing its partner network through the launch
of many new integrated offers, accelerating services and software,
and increasing selectivity on projects focusing on its sectors of
expertise.

Therefore, for 2016 the Group targets:
* Organic revenue growth to be flat to down low single-digit,
impacted by the Group's higher selectivity on project activities;

© +20bps to +60bps improvement on adjusted EBITA margin
before FX. The negative FX impact on margin is estimated at
-40bps to -50bps at current rates.
