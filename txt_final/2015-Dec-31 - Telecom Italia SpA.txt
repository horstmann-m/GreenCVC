"HIS" HY IO& (V+

During 2015, Telecom Italia initiated a fundamental process of renewal of its identity and corporate
structure, aimed at consolidating its leadership and above all supporting the future growth of the Group.
The fixed-mobile convergence, resulting from the increasing diffusion of smart handsets and the
development of digital platforms and infrastructures, is at the center of the Telco industry. In response to
this phenomenon, Telecom Italia has converged its entire commercial offering under TIM - the single
brand of the Group from the beginning of 2016 - which combines Telecom Italia's solidity and TIM's
innovation to provide a high quality customer experience through digital services and content.

On the technology side, there has been a sharp increase in the development of the mobile and fixed
ultra-broadband networks, as a result of overall capital expenditure of 3 billion euros, thanks to which
Telecom Italia/TIM has confirmed its status as the lead player in the digitization of Italy.

The diffusion of premium digital content and services with a particular focus on the video sector is the
basis of the capital expenditure program implemented. This included a strong boost to TIMvision, the
integrated platform branded by TIM, which had over 500,000 customers at the end of 2015, also thanks
to the agreements signed with major producers of international content.

A renewed portfolio of offerings has been launched to support the development and diffusion of services
and content, focusing on bundle and lock-up offers aimed at stabilizing the customer base through the
steady growth in consumption of fixed and mobile broadband data.

To respond to the streamlining process that is sweeping through the Telco industry, in 2015 the Group
signed agreements with the trade unions in order to manage personnel redundancies through solidarity
contracts, voluntary early-retirements and the use of the mobility scheme under Law 223/91. Against a
cost of over 400 million euros for 2015, the application of these provisions of law will bring significant
efficiency savings, starting from 2016.

Lastly, in 2015 the Group initiated a process of renewal of its entire industrial structure through the
transactions on the telecommunication towers carried out in Italy - with the stock exchange listing of the
subsidiary INWIT - and in Brazil - with the sale and leaseback of the assets. The Group has also
initiated the reorganization of its real estate structure, which will involve ten Italian towns and will lead to
the concentration of offices through the renegotiation or cancellation of lease contracts and the sale of
excess properties. In Rome, the work site has been opened for the Group's new headquarter, which will
be located in the EUR district from the recovery of the Towers built in the 1950s by the architect Cesare
Ligini.

The market

In 2015, the confirmed the trend of gradual recovery in revenues, with a reduction of
the decrease rate as compared to the previous quarters, due to a slowdown in the contraction of
traditional services and the growth of innovative services. In particular, our competitive positioning in the
Mobile segment continued to get stronger, with revenue returning to growth in the fourth quarter of
2015 compared to the same period of the prior year, driven by the higher mobile Internet penetration
and stable market share. In the Fixed segment, the recovery trend in revenues was driven by the positive
performance of broadband ARPU, steady growth in ADSL customers with premium bundle/flat deals,
and the development of ICT services.

In , the market was affected by a further deterioration in the macroeconomic scenario, which
caused a contraction in internal demand, higher inflation and the depreciation of the real from 3.22
reais per euro at the end of 2014 to 4.25 reais per euro at December 31, 2015. These factors
contributed to a general slowdown in growth in the mobile market compared to the previous quarters.

Against this context, the Tim Brasil group recorded a substantial hold on market share in the Mobile
segment with an increase in the postpaid customer base. However, at the same time, its revenues fell
as a result of faster migration from traditional voice-SMS services to innovative IP solutions, as well as
the further reduction in mobile termination rates (MTR), effective since late February 2015. The negative

Report on Operations
trend in mobile revenues was partly mitigated by the growth in Fixed revenues, in particular in the
wholesale business segment of the subsidiary Intelig and Broadband of TIM Live. !

Projects and non-recurring events

The financial results for 2015 were also characterized by the impact of a number of non-recurring events
and the launch of several projects to rationalize and improve operating efficiency.

In particular, from the end of 2014, Telecom Italia launched a major , which involves
a process of restructuring, the closure of a number of properties and renegotiations of leases with the
owners, all with a view to efficiency and cost-cutting, mainly by extending contract expiries and reducing
lease payments.

Average remaining term of the renegotiated contracts years 21
Increase in Tangible assets under lease/Financial payables for leases millions of euros 1,178

During 2015, were purchased 5 strategic properties, whose contracts were previously classified as
finance leases. Over one half of the renegotiated property rental contracts were previously accounted for
using the operating lease method, however, as a result of the changes to the relevant contracts, they
have been recognized in the statement of financial position at December 31, 2015 using the finance
method (Tangible assets held under finance leases). For more details, see the “Telecom Italia S.p.A.
Report on Operations”

On January 14, 2015, the company was established, to
which the parent Telecom Italia S.p.A., on April 1, 2015, transferred the business consisting of around
11,500 sites located in Italy where the radio transmission equipment for mobile telephone networks are
hosted, both for the Parent Company and other operators.

During the month of June 2015, the listing process (IPO) was successfully completed for the ordinary
shares of INWIT S.p.A. on the Electronic Stock Exchange organized and managed by Borsa Italiana
S.p.A., then followed in July by the exercise of the greenshoe option. This transaction did not result in a
loss of control for the Telecom Italia Group over INWIT and was therefore treated as a transaction
between shareholders in accordance with the accounting standards. Accordingly, no impacts were
recognized in the consolidated income statements and the effects of the transaction were recognized
directly as an increase in Equity attributable to Owners of the Parent.

in the Italian market and the sale of the ownership of the towers in Brazil - was due to the effects of
the recognition of higher debt for finance leases for the real estate project and for the leaseback of
part of the towers in Brazil, as well as the adverse effects generated by the bond buybacks whose
benefits, in terms of lower borrowing costs, will be seen in future years.

a decline in revenues for 2015 of 302 million euros (-2.0%), compared to 2014, but with a significant
recovery trend, particularly in revenues from services (-1.1% in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to the
same period of 2014; -1.5% in the third quarter 2015; -1.7% in the second quarter 2015: and -3.3% in
the first quarter 2015). This recovery in performance was due to an improvement in the competitive
scenario. This resulted in an acceleration in the growth of connectivity and content services for
broadband and ultrabroadband networks, stability of market share, and a steady reduction in the
erosion of ARPU on traditional services, mainly in the Mobile segment, which posted a positive
performance in the fourth quarter 2015, both in terms of total revenues (+0.7%) and revenues from
services (+0.1%), compared to the same period of 2014.

In 2015, the generated revenues of 17,139 million reais, down 2,359 million reais
(-12.1%) on the previous year. This was mainly due to the fall in revenues from services, which were
affected by the further reduction in the mobile termination rate and the contraction in revenues from
traditional voice and SMS services, only partially offset by the increase in revenue generated by the
innovative component.

EBITDA was particularly impacted by the change in the line items analyzed below:
¥ Acquisition of goods and services (8,533 million euros; 9,430 million euros in 2014).
The reduction of 897 million euros was mainly attributable to the decrease in the Brazil Business
Unit’s acquisition of goods and services (down by 1,149 million euros, including a negative exchange
rate effect of 558 million euros), partially offset by the increase by the Domestic Business Unit (215
million euros), mainly due to higher purchases of equipment and handsets, related to the increase in
product sales. This increase also reflected non-recurring items totaling 102 million euros.
¥ Employee benefits expenses (3,589 million euros; 3,119 million euros in 2014).
They increased by 470 million euros compared to 2014. The main factors that drove this change
were:
— An increase of 72 million euros in the Italian component of ordinary employee expenses, due to
the increased contractual minimum salaries - as established in the TLC National Collective
Labor Agreement signed on February 1, 2013, which set the pay-scale points effective from April
and October 2014 - and the growth in the average salaried workforce, due to the termination in
April 2015 of the “Solidarity Contracts” applied by the Parent and Telecom Italia Information
Technology. Compared to 2014, the average salaried workforce had a net increase of 1,842
employees, out of which 2,062 units connected to the ending of the solidarity contracts.

Telecom Italia Group Key Operating and Financial Data - Telecom Italia Group 21
Report on Operations
— The recognition of charges and provisions to Employee benefits and other minor items, of a non-
recurring nature, totaling 446 million euros. In particular, in 2015 the Parent and a number of
Group companies signed specific agreements with the trade unions for the application of the
provisions of law that, from 2016 and in subsequent years, will enable the reduction of
personnel redundancies generated by the streamlining processes affecting all the companies
operating in the TLC sector. These instruments will be implemented through solidarity contracts,
through voluntary early retirements (in application of Article 4, paragraphs 1-7ter, of Law 92 of
June 28, 2012, known as the “Fornero law”), and through the use of the mobility scheme under
Law 223/9108uch expenses consisted of 422 million euros for the Parent Telecom Italia S.p.A.,
17 million euros for the restructuring plan announced in May 2015 by Olivetti, 3 million euros for
the company Telecom Italia Information Technology, 2 million euros for HR Services, and 2
million euros for Telecom Italia Sparkle.

In 2014, provisions were made for non-recurring restructuring expenses totaling 8 million euros
(5 million euros by the Parent and 3 million euros by Olivetti).

More details are provided in the Note "Employee benefits expenses" of the Consolidated
Financial Statements at December 31, 2015 of the Telecom Italia Group.

— Adecrease of 40 million euros in the foreign component of employee benefits expenses due to
the higher increase in labor costs related to the growth in the average workforce (+426 average
employees) and local salary increases, which were offset by a negative exchange rate effect of
around 59 million euros, essentially relating to the Brazil Business Unit. In 2014, the company
Olivetti booked a total of 4 million euros of non-recurring restructuring expenses relating to
foreign companies.

Y¥ Other income (287 million euros; 401 million euros in 2014).
These fell by 114 million euros compared to the previous year.
In 2014, this item included the entire release of the risk provision, made in the 2009 Consolidated
Financial Statements for the alleged administrative offense pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree
231/2001, linked to the so-called Telecom Italia Sparkle affair (84 million euros).

Y¥ Other operating expenses (1,491 million euros; 1,175 million euros in 2014).

These increased by 316 million euros compared to 2014, mainly due to the presence of non-

recurring expenses of 518 million euros, resulting from regulatory disputes and penalties and the

liabilities related to those expenses, expenses for disputes with former employees, and liabilities
with customers and/or suppliers. Without these non-recurring expenses, other operating expenses
would have fallen by around 190 million euros.

In particular:

— write-downs and expenses in connection with credit management (345 million euros; 375 million
euros in 2014) consisting of 270 million euros for the Domestic Business Unit (295 million euros
in 2014) and 62 million euros for the Brazil Business Unit (80 million euros in 2014);

— provision charges (330 million euros; 84 million euros in 2014) consisting of 236 million euros
for the Domestic Business Unit (6 million euros in 2014) and 86 million euros for the Brazil
Business Unit (74 million euros in 2014);

— TLC operating fees and charges (342 million euros; 449 million euros in 2014) consisting of 285
million euros for the Brazil Business Unit (399 million euros in 2014) and 56 million euros for the
Domestic Business Unit (49 million euros in 2014).

Depreciation and amortization
Details are as follows:

(millions of euros)

Amortization of intangible assets with a finite useful life 1,788 1,854 (66)

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment - owned and
leased 2,347 2,430 (83)

The fall of 149 million euros was mainly attributable to the Domestic Business Unit (-85 million euros),
which was affected by the revision of the useful lives of the passive infrastructure of the Mobile Base
Transceiver Stations, which resulted in an overall impact of 51 million euros of lower depreciation, and
to the Brazil Business Unit (-68 million euros, net of negative exchange rate effects of 152 million
euros). Net of the exchange rate effect, the depreciation and amortization of the Brazil Business Unit
would have increased by 85 million euros, resulting from the acceleration in investments in the last 18-
24 months.

Further details are provided in the Note “Tangible assets (owned and under finance leases)” of the
Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2015 of the Telecom Italia Group.

Gains/(losses) on disposals of non-current assets

In 2015, this item amounted to 336 million euros, mainly attributable to the non-recurring gain of 1,211
million reais (approximately 328 million euros) realized by the Brazil Business Unit from the sale of the
first three tranches of telecommunications towers to American Tower do Brasil. See the section
“Financial and Operating Highlights of the Business Units of the Telecom Italia Group - Brazil Business
Unit” in this Report on Operations for more details.

In 2014 this item amounted to 29 million euros and mainly related to the realized gain, of about 38
million euros, from the sale by Telecom Italia S.p.A. of a property located in Milan, for a price of 75
million euros, which was offset by net losses of 11 million euros, mainly relating to the disposal of
tangible assets by the Domestic Business Unit.

Impairment net losses on non-current assets

This item amounted to 244 million euros in 2015 (1 million euros in 2014).

The impairment losses for the year 2015 included:

¥ 240 million euros on the Goodwill of the Brazil Business Unit due to the results of the impairment
testing conducted at December 31, 2015, carried out by comparing the recoverable amount of the
Brazil Cash Generating Unit (CGU) with its carrying amount on the same date;

¥ 4 million euros for other items.

EBIT

EBIT totaled 2,961 million euros (4,530 million euros in 2014), a decrease of 1,569 million euros
(-34.6%) compared to 2014; the EBIT margin was 15.0% (21.0% in 2014).

Organic EBIT was down 1,458 million euros, with an organic EBIT margin of 15.0% (21.4% in 2014).

EBIT in 2015 reflected the negative impact of non-recurring net expenses totaling 990 million euros. The
non-recurring expenses already described in the commentary on the EBITDA (1,076 million euros) and
the above mentioned goodwill impairment loss on the Brazil Business Unit (240 million euros) were
essentially offset by the positive impact of the gain of around 328 million euros from the sale of
telecommunications towers in Brazil. Without these non-recurring net expenses, the organic change in
EBIT would have been -8.3%, with an EBIT margin of 20.0%. For further details, see the Note "Significant
non-recurring events and transactions" in the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2015
of the Telecom Italia Group.

Organic EBIT is calculated as follows:

Exchange rate fluctuations were attributable to the Brazil Business Unit (-123 million euros) and the
Domestic Business Unit (+11 million euros), while the change in the scope of consolidation was the
result of the acquisition of Rete A.

Other income (expenses) from investments, net

In 2015, this item showed a positive balance of 10 million euros and mainly related to the gain from the
sale of the non-controlling interest in SIA S.p.A., which took place on July 10, 2015.

In 2014, this amounted to a positive 16 million euros, essentially referring to the remeasurement at fair
value of the 41.07% interest already held in Trentino NGN S.r.I., carried out pursuant to IFRS 3, following
the acquisition of control of the company by Telecom Italia S.p.A. - on February 28, 2014 - ata price of
17 million euros.

Finance income (expenses), net

Finance income (expenses) showed an increase in net expenses of 331 million euros, from 2,194

million euros in 2014 to 2,525 million euros in 2015.

This increase was linked to the effects of the changes in certain non-monetary items - of a valuation

and accounting nature, linked in particular to booking of derivatives - and of bond buybacks, which were

counterbalanced by the reduction in finance expenses connected to the related debt position.

In particular:

¥ the negative impact of 454 million euros (174 million euros in 2014) relating to the fair value
measurement through profit and loss - performed separately from its liability component - of the
embedded option included in the mandatory convertible bond issued by Telecom Italia Finance S.A.
at the end of 2013, for 1.3 billion euros (“Guaranteed Subordinated Mandatory Convertible Bonds
due 2016 convertible into ordinary shares of Telecom Italia S.p.A.”);

¥ a negative effect of 379 million euros in relation to the bond buybacks carried out during 2015 by
Telecom Italia S.p.A. for a total of 3.8 billion euros. This impact resulted from the difference between
the buyback prices and the values of the liabilities at the transaction date, net of the benefits from

Telecom Italia Group Key Operating and Financial Data - Telecom Italia Group 24
Report on Operations
the termination of several hedging derivatives linked to the bonds repurchased. In 2014, the
negative impact of the buybacks carried out during the period and the exercise of the early
redemption option for a bond amounted to 62 million euros.

Income tax expense

This item amounted to 401 million euros, and was down 527 million euros on 2014 (928 million euros)
mainly due to the lower tax base of the Parent Telecom Italia and the intervening full deductibility of
labor costs from the IRAP tax base introduced by Article 1 paragraph 20, of the 2014 Stability Law (Law

no. 190/14), which resulted in a reduction of around 60 million euros in IRAP tax.!
!

Profit (loss) from Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale

In 2015, this item amounted to 611 million euros (541 million euros in 2014) and it is mainly related to
the positive contribution to the consolidation from the Sofora - Telecom Argentina group.

More details are provided in the section "Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale" of
this Report on Operations and in the Note "Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale" in
the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2015 of the Telecom Italia Group.

Profit (loss) for the year

The details are as follows:

(millions of euros)

Attributable to:

Profit (loss) from continuing operations (161) 1,252
Profit (loss) from Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale 89 98
Profit (loss) from continuing operations 207 167
Profit (loss) from Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for sale 522 443

The loss for the year attributable to Owners of the Parent amounted to 72 million euros (profit for the
year 2014 attributable to Owners of the Parent of 1,350 million euros), and was pulled down by net non-
recurring expenses, the negative impact of Group bond buybacks during the first part of the year, whose
benefits will be seen in future years in the form of lower finance expenses, in addition to items of a
merely valuation and accounting nature that do not entail any monetary settlement, related in particular
to the fair value measurement of the embedded option included in the mandatory three-year convertible
bonds issued at the end of 2013. Without these impacts, profit for the year 2015 attributable to Owners
of the Parent would have been around 1.4 billion euros.

Revenues

In 2015 total revenues fell by 302 million euros compared to 2014 (-2.0%, from 15,303 million euros for
2014 to 15,001 million euros in 2015).

There were a number of significant indicators during the year 2015 and the last quarter including the
continued steady recovery in revenue performance, which strengthened compared to the previous
quarters, and positive performance in the Mobile business, both in terms of total revenues (+0.7% in the
fourth quarter of 2015) and revenues from services alone (+0.1% in the last quarter of 2015 compared to
the same period of the prior year).

This recovery of revenues was attributable to commercial actions aimed at progressively stabilizing the
customer base - with market share slightly up in both the Mobile and Fixed-line Broadband businesses -
and the ARPU, thanks to the growth in revenues from Fixed-line Broadband, ICT and Mobile Internet.

In detail:

Revenues from domestic services - amounting to 14,058 million euros for 2015 - were down 276 million

euros (-1.9% on the prior year). The performance by quarter continued the trend of recovery mentioned

above, which strengthened compared to the previous quarters: -1.1% in the fourth quarter 2015

compared to the same period of 2014; -1.5% in the third quarter 2015; -1.7% in the second quarter 2015;

and -3.3% in the first quarter 2015. In particular:

¥ revenues from Fixed-line services amounted to 10,372 million euros for the year and were down by
300 million euros compared to 2014 (-2.8%);

¥ revenues from services in the Mobile business were equal to 4,517 million euros, a decrease of 91
million euros compared to the prior year (-2.0%). The trends by quarter contributed to the improving
trend with a positive +0.1% in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to the same period of 2014, versus
-1.5% in the third quarter 2015; -2.5% in the second quarter 2015; and -4.2% in the first quarter
2015.

Revenues from product sales, including the change in work in progress, totaled 943 million euros in 2015

(-26 million euros compared to 2014), with an increase of 68 million euros in the Mobile business, thanks

to the continued growth in demand for advanced handsets (smartphones), and a decrease in the Fixed-

line business following the streamlining of the product portfolio.

EBITDA

EBITDA for the Domestic Business Unit totaled 5,567 million euros in 2015, down 1,431 million euros
compared to 2014 (-20.4%), with an EBITDA margin of 37.1% (-8.6 percentage points compared to the
prior year).

EBITDA in 2015 reflected the negative impact of non-recurring net expenses - as already described in the
Highlights section of this Report - totaling 1,028 million euros. Without these expenses the organic
change in EBITDA would have been -4.9%, with an EBITDA margin of 44.0%, down 1.2 percentage points
on 2014.

a result of non-recurring expenses of 87 million euros in 2015. Without these items, Acquisition of
goods and services would have increased by 128 million euros, in relation to the support for marketing
and advertising efforts, only partly recovered through streamlining policies and savings on indirect
costs and operating costs. In particular:

higher costs for the acquisition of goods for resale (+145 million euros, of which +78 million euros
for the acquisition of Mobile handsets linked to the increase in sales volumes);

higher advertising costs (+25 million euros, mainly related to the sponsoring of EXPO 2015 and the
launch of the new single Brand);

higher commercial costs (+24 million euros);

higher costs for revenues due to other operators (+26 million euros);

lower costs for indirect operating expenses, not directly linked to commercial and industrial
policies (-117 million euros).

increased by 476 million euros compared to 2014; The main factors

that drove this change were:

an increase of 60 million euros in ordinary employee expenses, mainly due to the increased
contractual minimums established in the TLC National Collective Labor Agreement signed on
February 1, 2013, which resulted in the addition of pay-scale points in April and October 2014, and
the growth in the average workforce by a total of 1,691 average employees compared to 2014. In
particular, the “Solidarity Contracts” applied by the Parent and T.I. Information Technology - which
involved a reduction in working hours and a consequent reduction in the average workforce -
came to an end in April 2015, resulting in an increase of 2,062 average employees compared to
2014;

the recognition of 429 million euros in charges and provisions to Employee Benefits, of a non-
recurring nature, consisting of 422 million euros for the Parent Telecom Italia S.p.A., 3 million
euros for the company Telecom Italia Information Technology, 2 million euros for HR services, and
2 million euros for Telecom Italia Sparkle. In particular, in 2015 the Parent signed specific
agreements with the trade unions for the application of the provisions of law that, from 2016 and
in subsequent years, will enable the reduction of personnel surpluses, resulting from the
streamlining processes affecting all the companies operating in the TLC sector. These instruments
will be implemented through solidarity contracts, through voluntary early retirements (in application
of Article 4, paragraphs 1-7ter, of Law 92 of June 28, 2012, known as the “Fornero law”), and
through the use of mobility scheme under Law 223/91. More details are provided in the Note
"Employee benefits expenses" of the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2015 of
the Telecom Italia Group.

¥ amounted to 999 million euros and increased by 429 million euros
compared to 2014, mainly due to the presence of non-recurring expenses for 512 million euros,
without which other operating expenses would have fallen by 79 million euros. The non-recurring
expenses mainly related to provisions and expenses resulting from regulatory disputes and penalties
and the liabilities related to those expenses, expenses for disputes with former employees, and
liabilities with customers and/or suppliers.

provision, made in the 2009 Consolidated Financial Statements for the alleged administrative offense
pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001, linked to the so-called Telecom Italia Sparkle affair (71 million
euros).

EBIT

EBIT for 2015 was equal to 2,359 million euros (3,738 million euros in 2014), down 1,379 million euros
on 2014 (-36.9%), with an EBIT margin of 15.7% (24.4% in 2014). The EBIT performance reflected the
reduction in EBITDA described above, which was partially offset by the reduction in depreciation and
amortization (85 million euros). EBIT for 2014 included the positive impact from the recognition of the
gain of 38 million euros from the sale of the property located in Milan.

EBIT for 2015 was impacted negatively by 1,028 million euros overall in non-recurring expenses, without

In detail:
¥ : revenues for the Consumer segment in 2015 amounted to 7,267 million euros, decreasing

by 82 million euros (-1.1%) compared to 2014, with a strong recovery trend driven, in particular, by the
progressive and structural recovery in the Mobile business, thanks to the steady market share and the

stabilization of ARPU levels.
In particular:

— revenues for the Mobile business were equal to 3,599 million euros and were slightly growing

compared to 2014 (+29 million euros, +0.8%), continuing the positive performance seen over two
consecutive quarters (fourth quarter 2015: +2.5%; third quarter: +3.3%; second quarter: -1.6%;
first quarter: -1.5%). Revenues from services decreased by 39 million euros (-1.2% on 2014), but
showing a significant trend of recovery (fourth quarter 2015: +1.5%; third quarter: -0.3%; second
quarter: -2.1%; first quarter: -4.3%), attributable to the easing of competitive pressure, the
progressive stabilization of the market share and the continued growth in Internet mobile and
digital services, supporting the stabilization of the ARPU;
Fixed-line revenues amounted to 3,705 million euros, decreasing by 112 million euros compared
to 2014 (-2.9%), with a slowdown in the last quarter of 2015 (-6.7%) compared to the
improvement seen from the second half of 2014 thanks to initiatives aimed at increasing ARPU
implemented in the final months of the year (repricing, introduction of flat tariffs, development of
bundles).

: revenues for the Business segment amounted to 4,600 million euros, decreasing by

224 million euros compared to 2014 (-4.6%). Revenues from services (4,232 million euros, -204
million euros compared to 2014) continued the stabilization trend that began during 2014 (-4.7% in

the fourth quarter 2015). In particular:

— revenues from Mobile services fell by 66 million euros (-5.5% on 2014); the positive performance

of new digital services, and, in particular, of the Mobile Internet component (+38 million euros,
+9% compared to 2014) was offset by a reduction in traditional mobile services for voice calls and
messaging (-109 million euros), due to the customer repositioning towards bundle deals with lower
overall ARPU;

revenues from Fixed-line services fell by 141 million euros (-4.3% compared to 2014): despite the
steady growth in revenues from ICT services (+5.7%), and in particular from Cloud services (+26%
compared to 2014), the segment continued to be adversely affected by the slow economic

Revenues

Revenues for 2015, amounting to 17,139 million reais, were down by 2,359 million reais (-12.1%) on
2014. Service revenues totaled 15,384 million reais, a decrease of 941 million reais compared to
16,325 million reais for 2014 (-5.8%). The lower overall revenue was partly attributable to the revenues
from incoming SMS and mobile traffic (-1,005 million reais, -40.2%), due to the reduction in the mobile
termination rate (MTR) and lower volumes, as well as to traditional voice and SMS outgoing traffic (-
1,216 million reais, -13.4%). This was only partially offset by the increase in revenue generated by the
innovative component, mobile data and VAS content (+1,213 million reais, +35.0%). Mobile Average
Revenue Per User (ARPU) amounted to 16.7 reais for 2015 compared with 17.7 reais for 2014 (-5.6%).
Revenues from product sales came to 1,755 million reais (3,173 million reais in 2014; -44.7%),
reflecting the impact of the Brazilian macroeconomic crisis on household spending propensity.

The total number of lines at December 31, 2015 amounted to 66,234 thousand, showing a decrease
compared to December 31, 2014 (-9,487 thousand). This corresponds to a market share of
approximately 25.7% (27% at December 31, 2014).!

EBITDA

EBITDA amounted to 5,358 million reais, 183 million reais lower than 2014 (-3.3%). The decline in
EBITDA was attributable to the fall in revenues, which was only partially offset by the deployment of
efficiency measures on cost items and the reduction in costs for revenues due to other operators and
the cost of sales; employee benefits expenses on the other hand also increased due to the salary
inflation adjustment, in addition to other net non-recurring costs of 53 million reais.

The EBITDA margin stood at 31.3%, 2.9 percentage points higher than in the previous year.

EBIT

EBIT amounted to 2,351 million reais, down 132 million reais compared to 2014. This result reflected
the lower EBITDA contribution, in addition to the goodwill impairment loss allocated on the Business Unit
of 887 million reais (240 million euros), but benefited from the positive impacts arising from the
conclusion of the first three tranches of sales of telecommunications towers to American Tower do
Brasil. More specifically, at the time of the sales, the gains arising on the assets sold amounted to 1,211
million reais and were already net of transaction costs.

Agreement for the sale of telecommunications towers

On November 21, 2014, the subsidiary Tim Celular signed a contract for the sale to American Tower do
Brasil of part of the mobile infrastructure (6,481 telecommunications towers), for a total value of
approximately 3 billion reais. The sales agreement was signed in conjunction with a “Master Lease
Agreement” having an overall term of 20 years and, accordingly, the transaction has to be considered as
a partial sale and lease back.

On June 30, 2014, Telecom Italia Media (Tl Media) and Gruppo Editoriale L’Espresso completed the
merger of the digital terrestrial network operator businesses respectively controlled by Persidera S.p.A.
and Rete A S.p.A..

The merger of Rete A by absorption into Persidera was executed on December 1, 2014.

Moreover, the merger of Telecom Italia Media S.p.A. into Telecom Italia S.p.A. was executed on
September 30, 2015, effective retroactively January 1, 2015 for accounting and tax purposes.

The table below shows the figures for the Media Business Unit which, for the first half of 2014, were not
including the results of Rete A; however, those results are taken into consideration for the calculation of

95.8% of the Italian population.
The coverage of the two Digital Multiplexes of the former Rete A was 93.4% and 93.7%.

Revenues!

Revenues amounted to 82 million euros in 2015, increasing by 11 million euros (+15.5%) compared to
the 71 million euros recorded in 2014. This change, which was positively driven by the acquisition of
Rete A business, not yet occurred in the first six months of 2014, was entirely attributable to the
Network Operator. Including the business of the former Rete A for the first six months of 2014, the
organic change in revenues was positive by 1.2%, and it was essentially linked to the launch of the new
SKYTG24 and Gazzetta TV channels, in addition to the increase in unit price of the main contracts.

EBITDA

EBITDA was a positive 37 million euros in 2015, up 12 million euros (+48%) compared to 2014 (25
million euros). This performance was driven by the aforementioned increase in revenues, as well as the
increase in other income, only partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, mainly attributable
to the costs from the former Rete A operations not present in the first six months of 2014. It is also
noted that EBITDA in 2014 reflected 7 million euros in operating costs relating to Telecom Italia Media
S.p.A. that were no longer present in 2015 following the merger with Telecom Italia S.p.A.; taking into
account these changes, organic EBITDA was up 5.7% compared to 2014.

EBIT

EBIT was positive at 14 million euros, up 8 million euros from 2014 (6 million euros). This performance
reflected the change in EBITDA described above, partially offset by the increase in depreciation and
amortization of 4 million euros.

Revenues!

Revenues for 2015 amounted to 40,495 million pesos, increasing by 7,154 million pesos (+21.5%)
compared to 2014 (33,341 million pesos), mainly thanks to the growth in the relative Average Revenue
Per User (ARPU). The main source of revenues was mobile telephony, which accounted for about 73% of
the consolidated revenues of the Sofora - Telecom Argentina group, an increase of about 20% on 2014.

: the number of fixed lines decreased by 50 thousand compared to the end
of 2014 to a total of 4,043 thousand at December 31, 2015. Even though regulated fixed-line services
in Argentina continued to be influenced by the rate freeze imposed by the Emergency Economic Law of
January 2002, Average Revenue Billed per User (ARBU) rose by 17.9% compared to 2014, thanks to the
sale of additional services and the spread of traffic plans. Revenues from data and ICT services also
rose, because the prices of their contracts are set in US dollars and so they benefited from the
significant exchange rate difference compared to 2014.

: Telecom Personal mobile lines in Argentina increased by 71 thousand
compared to the end of 2014, coming to a total of 19,656 thousand lines at December 31, 2015, of
which 33% were postpaid. At the same time, thanks to high-value customer acquisitions, ARPU grew by
23.3% to 91.5 pesos (74.2 pesos in 2014). A large part of this growth was attributable to value added
services (including revenue sharing and Internet), which together accounted for 60% of revenues from
mobile telephony services in 2015.

In Paraguay, the NUcleo customer base grew by 2.6% compared to December 31, 2014, reaching 2,546
thousand lines, 20% of which are postpaid.

Telecom Argentina's portfolio of broadband lines totaled 1,814 thousand accesses at
December 31, 2015, an increase of 43 thousand on December 31, 2014. ARPU rose by 35.6% to 207.4
pesos (153 pesos in 2014), largely thanks to up-selling strategies and price adjustments.

million pesos. The EBITDA margin came to 26.7%, up 0.7 percentage points over 2014, mainly due to

¥ amounting to 7,317 million pesos, increased by 1,662 million pesos

EBIT for 2015 came to 10,632 million pesos compared to 8,657 million pesos recorded for 2014. The
increase of 1,975 million pesos was attributable to the improvement in EBITDA, partially offset by higher

progress initiated in previous years and now abandoned. The EBIT margin stood at 26.3% of revenues
(+0.3 percentage points compared to 2014).

accessibility “anytime and anywhere”. Representing a first in Italy, TIM launched , the only
offer that allows customers to replace their smartphone every year free of charge.

However, connectivity has nothing to do with impersonal distance; it is about men and women coming
together and talking. Calls and voice are still the main way to feel close to people, so for this reason TIM
is the only operator to offer : clients own their minutes, which are never lost if
they are not used up and can be enjoyed at any time.

Daily life and leisure time

Useful solutions for everyone’s life that exploit the potential of fixed and mobile ultra-broadband are
increasingly part of our daily routine. For schools, for example, is the first offering on the
Italian market for students providing a complete solution with a tablet, LTE connectivity, and all school

Books are being read in digital format on e-readers, tablets and smartphones that are becoming
veritable pocket libraries: , with 60,000 registered users, is TIM’s publishing service with a
catalog of more than 120,000 eBooks, over 50 magazines and the main national and sports daily
newspapers.
Finally, is a mobile platform dedicated to digital games, offering a constantly updated catalog

content for children, recorded more than 22 million viewings, with over 500,000 subscribers at the end
of 2015 - double the 2014 figure, demonstrating that TV via the Internet is already a reality. This trend
has further strengthened in 2016, with more and more TIM customers (both inside and outside the

The partnership with Sky is one of the key components of TIM’s strategy for TV via the Internet, which

For businesses

Alongside a functioning administrative system, the driving force behind development and quality of life is
an ecosystem of businesses that generate value for employees and society.
In 2015, Telecom Italia’s business solutions were based on technological innovation, enabling increased
productivity and efficiency.
It is a short step from Nuvola Italiana, a cloud platform providing services ranging from

to IT security and communications, to the NuvolaStore. The NuvolaStore is
a true marketplace for small and medium-sized enterprises to quickly and easily find, buy and manage
the most advanced IT solutions.
And the service for digital invoicing, a reality that both government and business must now embrace, as
well as secure digital signatures, providing a new way to sign documents using a smartphone instead of
the usual devices like smart cards or tokens.

solutions that Telecom Italia is developing, either alone or with partners. Thanks to the development of
mobile platforms with technologies such as NFC, Augmented Reality, Visual Search, new solutions are
close at hand: integrated solutions for tourism, info-mobility, geolocation services, e-commerce, digital
signing and much more. The companies and institutions that subscribe to this initiative enjoy high
visibility within the , and they have the possibility to organize
conventions, workshops and meetings, and to project their corporate and institutional videos within the
Expo spaces.

The Commitment to the Public Administration

Telecom Italia takes part in the program of cost reduction and process efficiency in the public

administration, with a number of initiatives involving local authorities, and a diversified offering with

solutions that facilitate the relationship between citizens and institutions.

In particular:

¥ : Telecom Italia won the CONSIP Mobile 6 contract (24 months, for a maximum of

900 thousand lines), which covers around 19 thousand central and local authorities, providing
traditional voice and data services as well as mobile email services, device management, mobile
apps and workforce management, confirming its place as key operator for the public administration;

¥ : Trusted Identity and Mobile Identity to convey the identity of users securely
through dedicated apps or latest-generation SIMs;

¥ “paperless” services based on Cloud technology, Electronic
invoicing, Advanced Electronic Signature to optimize resources in total security;

¥ an app for checking ambulance equipment, remote
monitoring systems for vital signs, access to customer details or medical records from mobile and
tablet;

¥ : solutions for the world of education such as the Kit Scuola Digitale (Digital School

Kit) and the Scuolabook Network platform, launched in collaboration with Alfabook, the leader in the
digital educational publishing sector, acquired in July 2015 by Telecom Italia.

Telecom Italia also works closely with Municipalities and Regions for digital development through the
", part of the Connected Italy Project, now in its third edition, as well as the

initiatives for the development of ultra-broadband infrastructure for the development of digital services

across the country.

As regards ultra broadband (UBB), Telecom Italia has won the recent tenders called by various regions in

southern Italy in line with the objectives of the European Digital Agenda and the strategic guidelines

adopted by the Italian Government on the subject.

Marketing Policy Evolution

In 2015, Tim Brasil developed marketing initiatives aimed at improving the result in the postpaid

segment and defending its position in the prepaid segment, by making better use of the capacity and

coverage of its data network. The initiatives mainly focused on:

¥ by securing and defending Tim Brasil’s position in
the customer's choice of both the first and the second SIM card (target is to defend the customer
base), offering low-cost solutions for voice consumption, offset by an expected higher data
utilization;

¥ developing the growth driver for the “ ” postpaid segment, with maximum usage limit, from
an approach based on the migration from prepaid contracts, to a growth-based alpproach, focused
on positive gross-additions. The profitability of the offering was also improved by expanding the data
component of the bundle offer;

¥ through a geographically segmented strategy of gross-additions, focusing
on network availability and the competitive dynamics of the local market, to provide targeted offers
for higher value customers. Continued attention to the availability of a broad portfolio of handsets,
mainly smartphones, maintaining alignment with the most innovative offers on the market;

At the end of the public consultations initiated by the Authority in the first few months of 2015, the
Telecom Italia Reference Offers for 2013 were all finally approved and published. For the Reference
Offers for the year 2014, in December 2015 AGCom approved the 2014 prices for the following
services: WLR, access to NGAN infrastructure, End-to-End fiber service, and specific capacity
transmission services. The decision to approve the 2014 prices for wholesale unbundled access to
metallic network and sub-network, and co-location was published in January 2016. The decisions on
Bitstream services (copper and fiber) and Telecom Italia’s fixed-line interconnection are still pending.

'TIJ>ACE)AC!)::CEE!EC*K,:CE!

On December 22, 2015, after more than 3 years since the start of the proceedings and three national
public consultations, and after having received the go-ahead from the European Commission on October
5, AGCom approved the decision on the analysis of access markets for the period 2014-2017.

The Authority's decision proposes the deregulation of the last retail market still subject to CX! )-DC

regulation (retail access to the fixed-line public phone network) and revokes the corresponding

obligations, except for those relating to the authorization of retail offerings before their commercial
launch and replicability checks.

In addition, the Authority has set the rules and prices for access to the copper and fiber network of

Telecom Italia by competing operators, which are the same throughout Italy, with retroactive effect for

the year 2015.

The main changes to the existing regulatory framework concern:

a) the ability for operators to select external companies for line maintenance and activation services
under LLU and sub-loop unbundling (SLU) arrangements;

b) new non-discrimination measures designed to reduce differences in the supply and quality of
access services between the internal divisions of Telecom Italia and competing operators;

c) administrative simplification, through: i) harmonization of the system of SLAs and penalties across
the various access services, and ii) greater efficiency in procedures for approving Telecom Italia
Reference Offers;

d) more stringent penalties for Telecom Italia in the event of delay in the provision of access services
and fault repair;

e) new measures to incentivize Local Loop Unbundling (LLU) of smaller exchanges and to favor the
migration of LLU customers to NGN networks;

f) guidelines on the switch-off of the Telecom Italia exchanges open to LLU, with incentives for co-
located operators to switch to fiber, which will need to be better articulated through a specific
procedure to be undertaken by the Authority.

With regard to the provision of maintenance services and activation of LLU!and SLU lines by external

companies, on February 22, 2016 Telecom Italia submitted an implementation proposal for the

Authority’s approval that will be examined through an ad-hoc procedure. On February 22, 2016, Telecom

Italia also submitted a proposal for approval by the Authority on strengthening guarantees of equal

treatment, with particular reference to: (i) commercial management of orders by the National Wholesale

function; (ii) simplification of the causes of refusals; (iii) removal of misalignments between the
databases containing information on retail customers; (iv) reduction of differences in the workflow
applied to orders; (v) rationalization of the procedures for managing wholesale orders and stock.

Approval times for these new measures by the Authority are not set in advance.

Telecom Italia Group Main changes in the regulatory framework | 50
Report on Operations
The controls on wholesale prices set out the following:

a) subscription charges for wholesale access services remain the same in 2014 as in 2013.

b) prices are set for all wholesale access services to the copper and fiber-optic network from 2015 to
2017 (see the table below for the subscription charges, which shows the substantial stability of the
LLU charge and the significant cost “efficiencies” on copper and VULA bitstream services);

In July 2015, the Authority adopted the final ruling essentially confirming the regulations established at

intervening years and expected in the near future.
Specifically, in the user site loop circuits market (terminating), the Authority confirmed Telecom Italia’s
obligations regarding: access, transparency, non-discrimination, accounting separation, accounting for
costs and control of prices.
Regarding prices:
¥ the 2014 prices for terminating circuits approved by the Authority are the same as for 2013;
¥ for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017, for terminating SDH/PDH with a capacity below or equal to 155

reduction mechanism (IPC-6% for subscription charges, IP-8.6% for transport charges). For
terminating SDH/PDH with capacities above 155 Mbit/s using Ethernet technology over fiber optic,
and for ancillary services, the prices should be guided by the costs shown in Telecom Italia’s

Starting on May 1, 2015, Telecom Italia initiated a process of price simplification for its fixed-line (voice)

telephone service.

Specifically, for Consumer customers interested solely in the voice telephone service without a package

offer, the previous basic offer (rental plus telephone services according to consumption) was replaced by

a flat-type offer (“Tutto VOCE” - “All VOICE”). For a single subscription fee (29 euros per month, including

VAT) the customer has access to the line, together with unlimited calls to all fixed and mobile Italian

numbers. Customers who prefer to maintain an offer with voice traffic charged according to

consumption can choose to move free of charge to the Telecom Italia “Voice” offer (19 euros per month,
including VAT, i.e. rental offer only, with a cost for domestic calls to all fixed and mobile Italian numbers
of 10 cents per minute including VAT, with no connection fee.

Customers who do not intend to take up the offers described above still have the entire range of

Telecom Italia offers available to them.

In addition, effective from July 1, 2015, the billing method has been changed from the previous bi-

monthly to a monthly frequency.

Also for Business customers, starting from May 1, 2015, changes have been made to the basic offer for

telephone (voice) services:

Y¥ the monthly rental for telephone lines has increased from 22.50 euro per month excluding VAT to
24.90 euro per month excluding VAT. The rental fee has also been increased for certain types of
ISDN lines, both single and multiple;

The final proceeding closed by AGCom in relation to the determination of the contribution mechanism to
the net cost of the universal service refers back to resolution no. 100/14/CIR of 2014, in which the
Authority established that “)E! ,-!633FH! DJC! 8*>K,E,>-! >O! DJC2B)>*Q! N-,KC*E)A! EC*K,:C! O>*! 6334! @,AA!

cost for the universal service provided by Telecom Italia. Following this decision, the Company asked
AGCom to verify the market conditions for keeping the Universal Service obligations that fall to Telecom
Italia alone. At the same time, Telecom Italia urged the Ministry of Economic Development to begin the
review procedure of the Universal Service obligations as soon as possible. In response to this request,
on September 4, 2014, the Authority began to establish the procedures for designating appointed
operators to provide the universal service. Subsequently, in a letter dated November 28, 2014, the
Ministry of Economic Development asked AGCom to inform it of the outcome of the procedure and to
suspend any effects, pending definition of a common process. To date, the procedure is still suspended.

as parties required to pay for the net cost of the universal service. On October 15, 2015, Vodafone
submitted four notices to pay that demanded Telecom Italia to repay the amounts paid to the universal
service fund plus interest. In letters dated November 13 and 27, 2015, the Ministry for Economic
Development urged the parties to execute the ruling and therefore, for the Company to repay Vodafone
the amounts received by way of reimbursement of universal service charges for 1999-2000 and 2002-
2003.

The ruling of the Lazio Administrative Court of January 22, 2015 canceled Resolution 1/08/CIR with
which AGCom introduced and applied the new methodology for calculating the Universal Service
charges, applicable retroactively from 2004. Telecom Italia’s appeal to the G>-E,+A,>! ?,!\D)Dwas

In 2014 two rulings were published in relation to the lengthy litigation initiated by Telecom Italia
regarding the AGCom contribution fee. The first related to the decision of the Administrative Court (TAR)
of Lazio that fully upheld the pronouncement of the EU Court of Justice, which had been asked to issue a
preliminary ruling on the matter and accepted Telecom Italia's appeals concerning the cancellation of
the resolutions through which AGCom had requested payment of: (i) 26.6 million euros for sums
allegedly unpaid in the five-year period 2006-2010 and (ii) 24.2 million euros for the contribution fee for
the year 2011. The ruling of the Lazio TAR also affirmed the principle whereby the contribution fees of
operators of electronic communications networks and services should only cover costs relating to
activities unequivocally used for ex-ante regulation of this sector and that revenues connected to ex-ante
regulation and obtained as administration fees from the companies must not exceed the overall costs
directly pertaining to this regulatory activity. AGCom lodged an appealed against the Lazio TAR ruling and
requested a suspension, which, however, was rejected.

On February 17, 2015, the G>-E,+A,>!?,!\D)Ipublished the ruling which upheld the petitions by Telecom
Italia and rejected the appeal by AGCom, confirming the previous ruling of the Lazio Administrative
Court. This resulted in the annulment of the resolution containing the request for the payment of the
AGCom contribution fee of 26.6 million euros as an adjustment for the insufficient payment in the five-
year period 2006-2010. This ruling of the G>-E,+A,>!?,!\D)Dtas been appealed by AGCom before the
Court of Cassation.

On March 5, 2015 the AGCom resolution was published containing the guidelines for the payment of the
2015 contribution fee, which confirmed the tax base for the calculation of the contribution fee (revenues
from sales and services in the income statement published in the financial statements for the year
2013) and set a contribution rate of 0.15% (for the first time different from the rate applied to the other
markets governed by the Authority, such as media and publishing, set at 0.2%).

Telecom Italia has made the payment with reservation of the contribution fee requested by AGCom for
2015, at the same time lodging an appeal with the Administrative Court regarding its method of
calculation.

On August 18, 2015, the 2014 European Law came into force amending Article 34 of the CCE,
establishing that AGCom must publish a report of the administrative costs incurred for its TLC activities,

Telecom Italia Group Main changes in the regulatory framework | 53
Report on Operations
in order to enable a comparison between the overall amount of the contribution fee collected compared
to the actual costs incurred and, where necessary, make the appropriate adjustments.

On October 8, 2015, the Authority published its 2014 Annual Report which shows that the expenses
incurred for activities attributable to the electronic communications sectors amounted to around 37
million euros and that in 2014 the Authority received around 1.2 million euros more from the operators,
which will be deducted from the contribution fee requested from the operators for the year 2016.

In April 2014, Tl had paid 14 million euros to AGCom, via reverse charge and with reservations, in view

On December 22, 2015, AGCom ordered Telecom Italia to pay the remaining amount of the 2014
contribution fee and on February 22, 2016 the payment was made (of around 9.4 million euros), whilst
also submitting an appeal against the order, as a supplement to the appeal already submitted with
regard to the AGCom resolution for the 2014 contribution fee (resolution 547/13/CONS).

When awarded the 700 MHz (4G/LTE) frequencies, TIM Brasil assumed the obligation together with the
other parties awarded the license, to undertake all technical interventions throughout the country
needed to free the assigned frequencies (digitizing TV channels and stopping analogue broadcasts,
known as the “clean up”), for a total value of 1.2 billion reais. In April 2015, having formed the
consortium between the “EAD” operators for the management of clean-up activities, the first of three

Following the switch-off process, which lasted four years and was concluded on July 4, 2012, the
Ministry for Economic Development definitively assigned the digital frequencies.

Specifically, on June 28, 2012, the decision was taken to definitively assign the user rights of digital
frequencies to Persidera for 20 years.

In 2010, AGCom announced a beauty contest for the allocation of user rights to additional “digital
dividend” frequencies. Telecom Italia Media Broadcasting - now Persidera - participated in the contest
for the assignment of three lots, but the contest was canceled on April 28, 2012 with the entry into force
of Italian Law 44/12 and replaced with a competitive tender under new rules set out by AGCom in
Resolution 277/13/CONS.

The only party that participated in that tender - which was carried out in June 2014 and which Persidera
was unable to participate in, because it was incorrectly equated to RAI and Mediaset - was the Cairo
group, which was awarded a MUX for 31,626,000 euros.

Persidera, has been involved in various disputes on television frequencies. These include the appeal for
the failure to award a fourth network during the analogue-to-digital conversion of networks before the
switch off (the two analogue networks of La7 and MTV and the two digital networks MBONE and TIMB1)
and the appeal for the cancellation of the beauty contest.

Since 2014, Persidera has been required to pay administrative contribution fees and user rights for
frequencies, in accordance with articles 34 and 35 of Legislative Decree 259/03 “Electronic
Communications Code”. Up to and throughout 2013, however, the applicable system required
broadcasters to pay a concession fee equal to 1% of annual revenues.

The 2014 European Law (Law 115/2015 - Official Gazette of August 3, 2015) entered into force on
August 18, 2015, modifying the administrative charges for the general authorization as a digital
terrestrial network operator and the amounts of the contribution fees for connection bridges pursuant to
Article 34 and 35 of the Code.

On the basis of the new regulations, Persidera is required to pay an annual charge for the administrative
fees and connection bridges of around 250,000 euros.

In view of the findings of the EU Commission in relation to “DJC! )?K)-D)+CE! >O! ,--NBRC-D! ,-DC+*)DC?!

494/14/CONS to RAI and Mediaset, the 2016 Stability Law established that the Ministry for Economic
Development would be responsible for contribution fees for TV frequencies. The European regulatory
action consequently abrogated the AGCom Resolution, which would have required Persidera to incur an
unfair charge of over 13 million euros per year.

The amount of the contribution fees for the user rights to TV frequencies will be set by order of the
Ministry of Economic Development, to be issued by the end of February 2016, in a manner that is
transparent, proportionate to the scope, non-discriminatory and on the basis of the geographic coverage
of the rights authorized, the market value of the frequencies, taking account of mechanisms geared
towards the pro-competition allocation of transmission capacity (i.e. favorable to non-vertically
integrated operators such as Persidera), as well as the use of innovative technologies (i.e. DVB-T2).

Total revenue deriving from administrative charges and contribution fees for TV frequencies and
connection bridges is expected to be 32.8 million euros. This would bring Persidera towards a
reasonably sustainable expense.

At the end of the global conference on the regulation of the radio spectrum, held in Geneva in November

2015 (WRC-15), the 700 MHz band frequencies (between 694-790 MHz, corresponding to television

channels 49-60 UHF) currently used for TV were allocated on a co-primary basis to broadband mobile

services.

At national level, the 2016 Stability Law established a fund of 276,000 euros at the Ministry of

Economic Development for studies on refarming mobile services.

Based also on the results of the Lamy Report, the EU Commission is working on a decision to establish

harmonized use in EU countries of the 700 MHz band for mobile broadband.

The Lamy report is the result of the work of the High Level Group, on the future of the UHF spectrum,

formed in January 2014 and consisting of representatives of broadcasters, mobile operators and

manufacturers.

Pascal Lamy proposes a "2020-2030-2025" time scale to meet the objectives of the European Digital

Agenda, providing broadcasters a stable route to invest and grow in the medium to long term, structured

as follows:

— allocation of the 700 MHz band to mobile broadband services in 2020 with a margin of 2 years
(2018-2022) to take account of different market situations in the Member States;

— allocation of the bandwidth under 700 MHz (470-694 MHz) to broadcast services across Europe
until 2030;

— re-evaluation of the scenario in 2025 with an assessment of the state of the market and technology.

Telecom Italia Group Main changes in the regulatory framework | 56
Report on Operations
In Italy the 700 MHz band is more than 60% occupied by national network operators with user rights
expiring in 2032. This makes its release particularly difficult, requiring a more complicated procedure
than that used for the 800 MHz band, used only by local broadcasters.

It is highly probable, however, that the reallocation process will involve the refarming of lower
frequencies i.e., the return of the frequencies in exchange for financial compensation.

There is a remote possibility that, if the right regulatory and technical conditions arise at the right
moment, the operators currently assigned the user rights could use these frequencies to provide mobile
broadband services.

n this regard, the agreement signed with the Espresso group sets out the procedures through which
Telecom Italia will be able to acquire the user rights for channel 55 UHF (742 - 750 MHz) allocated to
the MUX TIMB2.

n particular, Telecom Italia has reserved itself two different alternative purchase options, involving: (i)
purchase of the user rights of UHF CH 55 or (ii) purchase of the entire share capital of TIMB2 S.r.l., a
company formed in 2014, to which this right of use would be conferred.

Both options may be exercised during the period from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2019.

n the case of granting the user right to CH 55 UHF, a leasing contract for such right of use will be signed
between the two companies.

The abovementioned transactions can take place without the need for authorization from the competent
authority as they are intragroup transactions.

COMPETITION

/-51&%",’

The market

In 2015, the Italian TLC market showed continued signs of a reduction in price-based competitive

pressure, as already seen in the second half of 2014. This helped to slow the gradual fall in the value of

traditional service components - voice, above all - of previous years.

Growth in Broadband and Ultrabroadband - particularly Mobile, also aided by the increased penetration

of next-generation handsets - continues to be the main driver of the market.

The competitive scenario remains characterized, on one side, by the opening of the TLC market to

competition from non-traditional operators (in particular Over the Top companies (OTTs) and producers

of electronic and consumer devices), and, on the other side, by telecommunications operators having

the opportunity to develop new "over the network" services (mainly in the IT and Media fields).

Consequently, telecommunications operators not only face ‘core competition’ with other operators in the

sector (including Mobile Virtual Operators) - still the factor that has the greatest impact on market

trends - but must also deal with the ‘invasion’ by OTTs and device producers, which operate entirely in

the digital world, using completely different assets and competitive strategies to TLC players.

Over time, therefore, the traditional players' business models are changing to meet the challenges from

the new entrants and to exploit new opportunities:

¥ in Media, broadcasters - with the Web becoming increasingly important as a complementary
distribution platform - are increasingly feeling competitive pressure from consumer electronics
companies, telecommunications operators and OTTs;

¥ in the Information Technology market, the decline in traditional revenues is driving the various
players towards cloud computing, with the goal of protecting their core business.
Telecommunications operators are expected to strengthen in this sector, including through
partnerships;

¥ in the Consumer Electronics market, producers can develop services that can be used through the
Internet, building on handset ownership and management of user experience, breaking the
relationship between customers and TLC operators;

¥ OTTs have, for some time now, been leading the transformation of the methods of use of TLC
services (including voice), increasingly integrating them with Media and IT.

With regard to the current positioning of the telecommunications operators in converging markets, on

the other hand, as partially described above, the following is taking place with different levels of

progress:

¥ development of Innovative Services in the IT market, particularly in Cloud services;

¥ development of new Digital Services, especially in the areas of Entertainment (e.g. TV over IP), Smart
Home, Digital Advertising, Mobile Payment-Digital Identity.

Competition in Fixed Telecommunications

The fixed-line telecommunications market continues, on one side, to see a significant decline in access
and voice revenues, due to the reduction in accesses and rates and the progressive shift of voice traffic
to mobile, and on the other side, the continued growth of broadband revenues; the decline in revenues
from the data transmission segment continues. In recent years, operators have concentrated mainly on
developing the penetration of Broadband and defending Voice by introducing bundled voice, broadband
and services deals in a highly competitive environment with consequent pricing pressure.

The evolution of the competitive product offering has also been influenced by consolidation, among
competitors, of an approach based on the control of infrastructure (above all Local Loop Unbundling -
LLU). The main fixed operators are also offering mobile services, also as Mobile Virtual Operators
(MVOs).

The competitive scenario in the Italian fixed telecommunications market is characterized by the
presence, in addition to Telecom Italia, of a number of operators such as Wind-Infostrada, Fastweb,

Telecom Italia Group Competition | 58
Report on Operations
Vodafone, BT Italia and Tiscali, that have different business models focused on different segments of
the market.

In 2015, the migration of customers from fixed-line to mobile telephony services continued, as well as
the migration to alternative communications solutions (Voice Over IP, e-mail and social network chat),
driven by the use of the Internet , the penetration of broadband, PCs and other connected devices, as
well as service quality.

At December 31, 2015, fixed accesses in Italy totaled approximately 20.2 million (including
infrastructured OLOs and Fixed Wireless Access), down from 2014. Competition in the access market
led to a gradual reduction in Telecom Italia's market share.

In the broadband market, at December 31, 2015 fixed broadband customers in Italy reached a
penetration rate on fixed accesses of about 74%. The spread of broadband is driven not only by the
penetration of personal computers and other enabled devices (e.g. Smart TVs), but also by the growing
demand for speed and access to new IP based services (Voice over IP, content - particularly Video,
social networking services, etc.).

Competition in Mobile Telecommunications

The mobile market, which is saturated and mature in its traditional component of voice services,
experienced a decline in the number of lines, due to the rationalization of second and third SIM cards (at
December 31, 2015, mobile lines in Italy numbered about 92.7 million, down by about 1.7% over 2014,
which still represents a very high penetration rate of the population, of approximately 152%).

Revenues from traditional service components, such as voice and messaging, continued to decline, both
as a result of competition between operators and of the increasing spread of "communication apps”, but
in 2015 it saw a gradual improvement compared to the drop of 2013 and the first half of 2014. Mobile
Broadband continued to grow and, although being unable to offset the drop in revenues from traditional
services, it represents the main strategic and business opportunity for the mobile TLC industry, also due
to the launch of LTE Ultra Broadband.

n 2015, the growth in mobile broadband customers continued thanks to the development of the small
screen segment, with a high penetration rate on mobile lines, especially as a result of the increasing
spread of smartphones.

Alongside innovative services that have already caught on and are under full-scale development, as in
the case of mobile apps, there are other market environments, associated with the development of
mobile broadband, with major potential for growth in the medium term, such as the Internet of Things
and mobile payment.

The competitive scenario in the Italian mobile telecommunications market is dominated by
Telecom Italia and also by three other infrastructured operators (Vodafone, Wind, H3G) which are
focused on different segments of the market or have different strategies. In August 2015, VimpelCom
and CK Hutchinson also announced that they had reached an agreement to establish an equal joint
venture between Wind and 3 Italia, subject to the necessary regulatory clearance.

In addition to these operators, the field also includes mobile virtual operators (MVO), of which
PosteMobile is the most important player. These operators continue to enjoy significant growth
compared to infrastructured operators.

The main macroeconomic indicators show a gradual deterioration in Brazil’s economy. Specifically, GDP
is estimated to have fallen by around 3.5% during 2015, with inflation above 10%, also as a result of a
series of increases in tariffs in regulated sectors; the forecasts for 2016 point towards a situation of high
volatility.

The acceleration in inflation is having a significant impact on household purchasing power, with a
consequent decline in economic wellbeing, especially for lower-income sections of society.

It is also worth noting the increasing fiscal pressure, with many Brazilian states set to increase their
taxes on services (above all ICMS and VAT). These measures will have a direct impact on

Telecom Italia Group Competition | 59
Report on Operations
telecommunications operators, for which ICMS accounts for around 85% of indirect taxes paid on
revenues.

The entire telecommunications sector has been badly exposed to the current economic crisis, with a
substantial contraction in total revenues.

The rise in data use and the simultaneous fall in voice traffic reflects the most significant phenomenon:
to reduce their spending, customers are favoring OTT services (especially Whatsapp) as an alternative to
traditional voice services. This has now overshadowed the previous paradigm based on a concept of
Community (customers having several SIMs from various operators to benefit from on-net tariffs that are
much better than off-net tariffs) leading to a progress concentration (and reduction) in the number of
SIMs on the market. The impacts on operators are highly significant, especially for TIM, in light of its
Customer Base being particularly exposed to the Prepaid segment and its “second SIM” positioning.

Against this context, at the end of 2015 the Brazilian mobile market reached 257.8 million lines, a fall of
8.2% compared to the previous year, and a penetration of 125.7% of the population (138.0% in 2014)
with the loss of 22.9 million lines.

particular:

¥

the posted capital expenditures of 3,900 million euros, an increase of
1,117 million euros compared to 2014. This increase was driven in particular by: the acceleration
and increase in innovative investments dedicated to the development of next-generation networks
and services (+788 million euros), which reached 44% of total investments, compared to 33% for
2014, the award of the user rights for the frequencies of the L band (231 million euros), and the

effect of 341 million euros) compared to 2014; these capital expenditures were mainly aimed at the
development of the industrial infrastructure and at sales support platforms. In 2014, capital
expenditures included the purchase of the 700 MHz license for around 936 million euros.

Change in net operating working capital

The change in net operating working capital for 2015 was a decrease of 334 million euros (decrease of
464 million euros in 2014). In particular:

¥

the change in inventories and the management of trade receivables generated positive impacts of
56 million euros and 410 million euros, respectively. The change in trade receivables reflected the
significant depreciation in the Brazilian real, which resulted in a reduction of almost 220 million
euros in trade receivables expressed in euros;

the change in trade payables (-623 million euros) also reflected the performance of the Brazilian
real, which resulted in a reduction of almost 430 million euros in trade payables expressed in euros.

Change in provisions for employee benefits, operating provisions and
other changes

The changes in provisions for employee benefits and operating provisions mainly reflected the above-

bondholders following the issue of the bond and the debt component of the financial instrument issued.
The debt component is equal to the fair value of an identical liability issued by the Company at market
conditions but without the conversion right, while the remainder, up to the amount received, was
recognized as a component of shareholders' equity (the "residual method").

Financial investments flow

In 2015, this item amounted to 51 million euros and mainly related to the outlay of 23 million euros for
the acquisition of 50% of the share capital of Alfiere S.p.A., a real estate company that owns several
buildings in the EUR district of Rome that will be used by Telecom Italia in the future as an headquarter.
In July 2015, 100% of the equity capital of Alfabook S.r.l. was also acquired; this transaction
represented a financial investment of 6 million euros (of which 5 million euros as the price and 1 million
euros for the net financial debt acquired). Lastly, in October, around 9 million euros were paid out for the
withdrawal rights exercised by the previous shareholders of Telecom Italia Media S.p.A., which was
merged into Telecom Italia on September 30, 2015.

In 2014 the item amounted to 32 million euros and mainly consisted of 9 million euros for the
acquisition by Telecom Italia S.p.A. of the controlling interest in Trentino NGN S.r.I. which took place on
February 28, 2014, and 21 million euros for the acquisition of the controlling interest in Rete A S.p.A.,
with subsequent merger into the parent Persidera S.p.A..

Change in finance leasing contracts

This item represents the higher value of tangible assets under finance lease, which is also a reflection of
the associated higher financial payables, posted mainly as a result of contractual renegotiations that
took place during 2015 as part of the project of transformation of real estate assets by Telecom Italia
S.p.A. (1,178 million euros) and of the finance lease contract concluded by the Tim Brasil group on part

million euros). Further details are provided in the Note “Tangible assets (owned and under finance
leases)” of the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2015 of the Telecom Italia Group.

Finance expenses, income taxes and other net non-operating
requirements flow

This item mainly includes the payment, in 2015, of the net finance expenses (1,513 million euros) and
taxes (363 million euros), as well as the change in non-operating receivables and payables.
In 2014, the income taxes flow (427 million euros) included the effect from the sale without recourse of
IRES tax credits to factoring companies, which generated net proceeds of 231 million euros.

Reduction/(Increase) in net financial debt from Discontinued
operations/Non-current assets held for sale

This was a negative 243 million euros and reflected, among other things, the completion of the
acquisition of 4G licenses by the Sofora - Telecom Argentina group that resulted in an outlay of around
220 million euros.

The financial risk management policies of the Telecom Italia Group are aimed at minimizing market
risks, fully hedging exchange rate risk, and optimizing interest rate exposure through appropriate
diversification of the portfolio, which is also achieved by using carefully selected derivative financial
instruments. Such instruments, it Should be stressed, are not used for speculative purposes and all have
an underlying, which is hedged.

In addition, to determine its exposure to interest rates, the Group sets an optimum composition for the
fixed-rate and variable-rate debt structure and uses derivative financial instruments to achieve that
composition. Taking into account the Group's operating activities, the optimum mix of medium/long-term
non-current financial liabilities has been established, on the basis of the nominal amount, at a range of
65% - 75% for the fixed-rate component and 25% - 35% for the variable-rate component.

In managing market risks, the Group has adopted Guidelines for the "Management and control of
financial risk" and mainly uses IRS and CCIRS derivative financial instruments.

To provide a better representation of the true performance of Net Financial Debt, from 2009, in addition
to the usual indicator (renamed "Net financial debt carrying amount"), a measure called "Adjusted net
financial debt" has also been shown, which neutralizes the effects caused by the volatility of financial
markets. Given that some components of the fair value measurement of derivatives (contracts for
setting the exchange and interest rate for contractual flows) and derivatives embedded in other financial
instruments do not result in actual monetary settlement, the "Adjusted net financial debt" excludes
these purely accounting and non-monetary effects (including the effects resulting from the introduction
of IFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement from January 1, 2013) from the measurement of derivatives and
related financial liabilities/assets.

The sales of trade receivables to factoring companies finalized in 2015 resulted in a positive effect on
net financial debt at December 31, 2015 of 1,106 million euros (1,316 million euros at December 31,
2014).

Sustainability Section of this Report on Operations.

EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO DECEMBER 31, 2015

For details of subsequent events see the specific Note "Events Subsequent to December 31, 2015" in
the Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements at December 31, 2015 of the Telecom Italia Group
and Telecom Italia S.p.A., respectively.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR 2016

As envisaged in the Industrial Plan, and continuing on the realizations of 2015, in 2016 an increase in
capital expenditure is planned for the Domestic area, with the primary aim of ensuring continued
improvement in operating performance and long-term growth for the Group. The improvement of the
market conditions in 2015 allowed this opportunity, which will result in an increase in the speed of
capital expenditure for the three-year period 2016-2018 by almost 2 billion euros compared to the
amount indicated in the presentation of the 2015-2017 Plan. This difference will be funded by the
generation of the underlying operating cash flow. At the same time, at Group level, a roadmap is
developed for the reduction of the financial debt, financed in particular by the conversion of the
Mandatory Convertible Bond - contractually scheduled for November 2016 for 1.3 billion euros - and
the sales of the remaining stake in Telecom Argentina and a significant part of the stake in INWIT. At the
end of 2018 the Adjusted Net Debt/reported EBITDA ratio is expected to be below 3x.

Domestic capital expenditures in the three-year period 2016-2018 will therefore reach almost 12 billion
euros, of which around 6.7 billion euros allocated to the innovative component (NGN; LTE; Cloud,
Sparkle, Platforms and Transformation) with the objective for the end of 2018 of achieving a coverage in
Italy of 84% of the population with new generation networks, through fiber optic networks, and 98% of
the population through the LTE mobile network (4G), confirming the leadership role in Italy's
infrastructure development and digitization.

The main areas of development of innovative technologies are:

¥ the acceleration of the development of the fiber optic fixed ultra-broadband, to which 3.6 billion
euros will be allocated;

Y¥ the LTE mobile ultra-broadband, for which capital expenditure of 1.2 billion euros is planned;

¥ the further development of the Cloud, the Platforms and the Transformation initiatives (such as the
shift to an “All-IP Network” and the decommissioning of some Network segments) with related
capital expenditure of 1.2 billion euros;

¥ Telecom Italia Sparkle, with around 400 million euros to be invested for the development of its
international operations.

TIM is continuing its process of transformation and transition from a traditional Telco to a Digital Telco &
Platform Company, facilitating Italy's digital life: a business model based on innovative infrastructure
and high quality customer service, increasingly focused on the diffusion of premium digital services and
content offered within a customizable platform, available everywhere and on any device.

In particular, in the Domestic Mobile segment - where competition based on pricing is steadily easing
and more attention is being given to the level of service, together with continued strong growth in data
usage - TIM will focus increasingly on the adoption of 4G by its customers, encouraged by the growing
penetration of smartphones and bundled offers with distinctive digital content. This will enable the
company to increase its ARPU and strengthen its position as a market leader.

Telecom Italia Group Business outlook for the year 2016 | 81
Report on Operations
In the Domestic Fixed-line segment, TIM expects to reduce the decline in the number of customers
already from 2016, thanks to the acceleration of the diffusion of fiber, convergence and the
strengthening of its positioning in Multimedia Entertainment, which includes operations in the areas of
Video, Music, Gaming and Publishing. TIM will also continue to support Italian companies in their
process of digital transformation with its ICT and Cloud services, through an approach differentiated
according to the characteristics of the customers, aimed at achieving distinctive positioning in the most
attractive vertical markets.

The above investment, commercial development and competitive positioning initiatives, accompanied by
rigorous transformation and cost efficiency actions and programs, represent the foundations for a
further improvement in operating performance, with the objective of stabilizing EBITDA already in 2016.

In Brazil, the Plan takes account of and reflects the profound changes in the macroeconomic, political
and market situation seen in recent months.

Indeed, the latest estimates of economic performance show a further steady deterioration in the main
indicators for 2016 as a whole. Specifically, GDP is expected to fall by almost 3%, with inflation still high
- also as a result of a series of increases in tariffs in regulated sectors - and highly volatile. The rise in
inflation could have an increasingly significant impact on household purchasing power, with a
consequent decline in economic well being, especially for lower-income sections of society. In addition,
the exchange rate with the dollar reached and exceeded the level of 4.0 real/USD during 2015, with
forecasts of an increase during the Plan up to 4.20 real/USD.

The entire telecommunications segment (particularly the prepaid Mobile segment) is highly exposed to
this scenario, with a decline in the overall value of the market also due to its substantial maturity and
saturation.

In addition, Brazil is seeing a trend of constant and steady growth in data usage, which is even more
intense than in the other major countries. This is being accompanied by a reduction in voice and
messaging traffic, driven by the objective of optimizing and reducing expenditure on the part of
customers, who are favoring the use of services offered by the OTTs (particularly Whatsapp) as an
alternative to the traditional models of service use.

In this scenario, TIM Brasil is setting itself the objective of growing in terms of market share on revenues
and profitability improvement (EBITDA Margin) thanks to its significant capital expenditure program -
which will reach 14 billion reais in the three-year period 2016-2018 - and a renewal of its commercial
positioning, in order to be competitive in terms of offering and customer experience. Also in Brazil, TIM
will be focusing on 4G where it is already a leader, with the development of an increasingly high quality
service, through a “mobile challenger” approach, which it has once again demonstrated by being ahead
of the game in the symmetric “on/off net” offers. At the same time, the company will be focusing
attentively on efficiency, as a structural and necessary element for the stability and financial
sustainability of the Plan.

Report on Operations
MAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

The business outlook for 2016 could be affected by risks and uncertainties caused by a multitude of
factors, the majority of which are beyond the Group's control.

In such a scenario, risk management becomes a strategic tool for value creation. The Telecom Italia
Group has adopted an Enterprise Risk Management Model based on the methodology of the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (ERM CoSO Report), which enables the
identification and management of risk in a uniform manner within the Group companies, highlighting
potential synergies among the actors involved in the assessment of the Internal Control and Risk
Management System. The ERM process is designed to identify potential events that may affect the
business, to manage risk within acceptable limits and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
achievement of corporate objectives.

The main risks affecting the business activities of the Telecom Italia Group, which may impact, even
significantly, the ability to achieve the objectives of the Group are presented below.

&%30% 1#",”3"&>&’

Risks related to macro economic factors

The Group's economic and financial situation is subject to the influence of numerous macroeconomic
factors such as economic growth, political stability, consumer confidence, and changes in interest rates
and exchange rates in the markets in which it operates. The expected results may be affected, in the
domestic market, by the struggling economic recovery associated with a high rate of unemployment and
the consequent reduction in income available for consumption. In the Brazilian market, the expected
results may be affected by the further deterioration of the macroeconomic environment, with the country
currently in economic recession, and the accompanying deterioration in operating conditions. These
factors mean that the possibility of consequent goodwill impairment losses cannot be ruled out.

In addition, the Telecom Italia Group is currently undertaking numerous projects and transactions,
including corporate and extraordinary transactions, whose feasibility and completion could be affected
by factors outside the control of management, such as political and regulatory factors, currency
exchange restrictions, bureaucratic regulations etc.. As a result, the financial outcomes of these projects
and transactions may differ, even significantly, from expectations.

Risks related to competition

The telecommunications market is characterized by strong competition that may reduce our share in the
markets we operate in as well as lower prices and margins. Competition is focused, on one hand, on
innovative products and services and, on other hand, on the price of traditional services. In addition, in
the area of infrastructure competition, the growth of alternative operators could represent a threat for
Telecom Italia particularly in the years of the plan after 2016 and also beyond the Plan period. In the
Brazilian market the trend in the telecommunications industry is changing rapidly, amplifying the
deterioration in the macroeconomic environment. The competition risk consists of the increased
acceleration in the process of replacement of traditional services with innovative services, and the
downsizing of consumption by customers (e.g. reduction in multi-SIM customers). In this scenario, the
Tim Brasil group may be further impacted in the short term to a greater extent than its main competitors,
due to the higher proportion of customers with prepaid services, which are more affected by the current
macroeconomic situation.

Telecom Italia Group Main risks and uncertainties
Report on Operations

83
-2130%"-.0$'3"&>&’

Operational risks inherent in our business relate to possible inadequacies in internal processes, external
factors, frauds, employee errors, errors in properly documenting transactions, loss of critical or
commercially sensitive data and failures in systems and/or network platforms.

Risks related to business continuity

Our success depends heavily on the ability to deliver the services we provide through the IT
infrastructure and network on a continuous and uninterrupted basis. The infrastructure is susceptible to
interruptions due to failures of information and communication technologies, lack of electricity, floods,
storms and human errors. Unexpected problems in installations, system failures, hardware and software
failures, computer viruses or hacker attacks could affect the quality of services and cause service
interruptions. Each of these events could result in a reduction in traffic and a reduction in revenues
and/or in an increase of restoration costs, with an adverse impact on the level of customer satisfaction
and number of customers, as well as our reputation.

Risks related to the development of fixed and mobile networks

To maintain and expand our customer portfolio in each of the markets in which we operate, it is
necessary to maintain, update and improve existing networks in a timely manner. A reliable and high
quality network is necessary to maintain the customer base and minimize the terminations to protect
the Company's revenues from erosion. The maintenance and improvement of existing installations
depend on our ability to:

Y¥ upgrade the capabilities of the networks to provide customers with services that are closer to their
needs; in the regard the Group may be engaged in the participation in tenders for broadcasting
frequencies whose outcomes, in terms of financial requirements, may differ, even significantly, from
expectations;

¥ increase the geographical coverage of innovative services;

¥ upgrade the structure of the systems and the networks to adapt it to new technologies.

Risks of internal/external fraud.

The Group has adopted an organizational model to prevent fraud. However, the implementation of this
model cannot ensure the total mitigation of the risk. Dishonest activities and illegal acts committed by
people inside and outside the organization could adversely affect the Company's operating results,
financial position and image.

Risks related to Disputes and Litigation

The Group has to deal with disputes and litigation with tax authorities, regulators, competition
authorities, other telecommunications operators and other entities. The possible impacts of such
proceedings are generally uncertain. In the event of settlement unfavorable to the Group, these issues
may, individually or as whole, have an adverse effect, which may even be significant, on its operating
results, financial position and cash flows.

4".0.,"0$' 3" &>&’

The Telecom Italia Group may be exposed to financial risks such as risks arising from fluctuations in
interest rates and exchange rates, credit risk, liquidity risk and risks related to the performance of the
equity markets in general, and - more specifically - risks related to the performance of the share price
of the Group companies. These risks may adversely impact the earnings and the financial structure of
the Group. Accordingly, to manage those risks, Telecom Italia Group has established guidelines, at

Telecom Italia Group Main risks and uncertainties | 84
Report on Operations
central level, which must be followed for operational management, identification of the most suitable
financial instruments to meet set goals, and monitoring the results achieved. In particular, in order to
mitigate the liquidity risk, the Group aims to maintain an "adequate level of financial flexibility", in terms
of cash and syndicated committed credit lines, enabling it to cover refinancing requirements at least for
the next 12 -18 months.

31#9$0%-3<’0./’ ,-52$"0., 173" &>&’

Regulatory risks

The telecommunications industry is highly regulated. In this context, new decisions by the regulator and

changes in the regulatory environment may affect the expected results of the Group. More specifically,

the elements which introduce uncertainty are:

¥ lack of predictability in the timing of the introduction and consequent results of new processes;

¥ decisions with retroactive effect (i.e. revision of prices relating to prior years as a result of an
administrative judgment) with potential impact on the timing of return on investment;

¥ decisions that can influence the technological choices made and to be made, with potential impact
on the timing of return on investment.

In 2015, in order to further enhance the guarantees of equality of treatment between retail customers

and wholesale customers, Telecom Italia initiated a project aimed at intervening on both the

equivalence model and the instruments used to assess the supply of wholesale services. The project

and the related implementation roadmap were approved by the Board of Directors of Telecom Italia on

November 5, 2015. The risk is associated with the assessment of the effectiveness of Telecom Italia's

project by the designated organizations (AGCom and AGCM). The positive assessment of the

implementation of the equivalence project is a necessary condition for the termination of the A428

proceedings for failure to provide services, with consequent removal of the associated sanction risk.

Compliance risks

The Telecom Italia Group may be exposed to risks of non-compliance due to non-observance/ breach of
internal (self-regulation such as, for example, bylaws, code of ethics) and external rules (laws and
regulations), with consequent judicial or administrative penalties, financial losses or reputational
damage.

The Group aims to ensure that processes, procedures, systems and corporate conduct comply with legal
requirements. There may be some necessary time lags in making the processes compliant when non-
conformity has been identified.

INFORMATION FOR INVESTORS

The Group attaches great importance to the quality of the information on its activities provided to the
financial markets, investors and all its stakeholders. Subject to the requirements of confidentiality
dictated by the running of the business and statutory obligations, this communication takes place in full
compliance with the criteria of transparency, fairness, clarity, timeliness and equality of access. The
Company has also established specific communication channels for shareholders, bondholders and
other stakeholders who are interested in obtaining financial and non-financial information on the Group.
The Investor Relations function manages relations with all types of investor, both institutional and retail
(including small shareholder associations), bondholders, socially responsible investors, and equity and
credit analysts. The responses to the financial markets are based on criteria of relevance, sensitivity and
consistency with respect to the Group structure and the actions taken to achieve the plan targets,
illustrating the ordinary and extraordinary performance of company operations and the related financial
trends. In terms of relations with individual (retail) shareholders - representing over 400,000 owners of
ordinary shares - Telecom Italia aims to provide rapid and effective responses, by developing specific
forms of communication.

In 2015, the Group organized quarterly conference calls, international road shows, meetings at the
company's corporate offices, an investor day and a specific offsite event for analysts and investors, in
addition to attending numerous industry sector conferences. Over 600 investors were met during these
events, in addition to the direct contacts and telephone conversations handled on a daily basis. In
February 2016, during the annual appointment with investors for the publication of the 2015
preliminary results and the 2016-18 strategic plan, the communications with the Financial Community
continued with the involvement of the Group’s top management in an extensive program of road shows
in the major financial centers in Europe and the United States. These events were attended by over 120
investors, representing around 22% of Telecom Italia’s ordinary share capital and 21% of its savings

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

In this Report on Operations, in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Telecom Italia Group and
in the Separate Financial Statements of the Parent, Telecom Italia S.p.A., for the year ended December

31,

2015, in addition to the conventional financial performance measures established by IFRS, certain

JADC*-)D,KC!8C*O>*B)-:C!BC)EMt€Bresented for purposes of a better understanding of the trend of
operations and the financial condition. Such measures, which are also presented in other periodical
financial reports (half-year financial Report at June 30 and interim Reports at March 31 and
September 30) should, however, not be considered as a substitute for those required by IFRS.

The alternative performance measures used are described below:

¥

EBITDA: this financial measure is used by Telecom Italia as the financial target in internal
presentations (business plans) and in external presentations (to analysts and investors). It
represents a useful unit of measurement for assessing the operating performance of the Group (as a
whole and at Business Unit level) and the Parent, Telecom Italia S.p.A., in addition to EBIT. These
measures are calculated as follows:

Finance expenses

Finance income

+/-

Other expenses (income) from investments

+/-

+/-

Share of losses (profits) of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method (2)

Impairment losses (reversals) on non-current assets

+/-

Losses (gains) on disposals of non-current assets

Depreciation and amortization

eS

B

¥

“Expenses (income) from investments” for Telecom Italia S.p.A.

Line item in Group consolidated financial statements only.

Organic change in Revenues, EBITDA and EBIT: these measures express changes (amount and/or
percentage) in revenues, EBITDA and EBIT, excluding, where applicable, the effects of the change in
the scope of consolidation and exchange differences. !

Telecom Italia believes that the presentation of the organic change in revenues, EBITDA and EBIT
allows for a more complete and effective understanding of the operating performance of the Group
(as a whole and at Business Unit level) and the Parent. This method of presenting information is also
used in presentations to analysts and investors. This Report on Operations provides a reconciliation
between the “reported figure” and the “organic” figure.

Net Financial Debt: Telecom Italia believes that Net Financial Debt represents an accurate indicator
of its ability to meet its financial obligations. It is represented by Gross Financial Debt less Cash and
Cash Equivalents and other Financial Assets. The Report on Operations includes two tables showing
the amounts taken from the statement of financial position and used to calculate the Net Financial
Debt of the Group and Parent respectively.

To better represent the real performance of Net Financial Debt, in addition to the usual indicator
(called “Net financial debt carrying amount”), “Adjusted net financial debt” is also shown, which
excludes effects that are purely accounting and non-monetary in nature deriving from the fair value
measurement of derivatives and related financial assets and liabilities.

The financial results for 2015 of Telecom Italia were also characterized by the launch of several projects
to rationalize and improve operating efficiency, illustrated below.

At the end of 2014, Telecom Italia launched a major , which involves a process of
restructuring, the closure of a number of properties and renegotiations of leases with the owners, all
with a view to efficiency and cost-cutting, mainly realized by extending contract expiries and reducing
lease payments.

More specifically, in 2015 the company purchased three strategic properties previously held under
finance leases, while renegotiations were concluded and/or new contracts were signed for around 750
leases.

More than one half of these lease contracts were previously accounted for using the operating lease
method; following the changes to the relevant contracts, they were accounted for in the statement of
financial position at December 31, 2015 using the financial method (Property, plant and equipment held
under finance leases). The renegotiations and new contracts, together with the change in accounting
treatment, resulted in a total impact on the balance sheet at December 31, 2015 of 1,178 million euros
in terms of higher tangible assets and corresponding liabilities related to finance leases.

The activities related to the development of the Project will continue in 2016 and will result - when fully
implemented - in a significant reduction in rental costs and savings in terms of electricity, facility
services, rationalization of space and costs associated with the dispersion of locations.

As part of the overall streamlining of the Group's owned and leased property assets, the company

, wholly owned by Telecom Italia, was established in November 2015, for the purpose
of developing projects and operations in the real estate sector. In particular, at the end of 2015 the
company purchased two strategic properties from third parties, taking over the lease contracts with
Telecom Italia.

On April 1, 2015, Telecom Italia S.p.A. completed the transfer to the subsidiary

, established on January 14, 2015, of the business unit consisting of around
11,500 sites in Italy (Towers) that house the radio transmission equipment for the mobile telephone
networks, both for Telecom Italia and other operators. In June 2015, the IPO was successfully completed
for the ordinary shares of INWIT S.p.A. on the Electronic Stock Exchange organized and managed by
Borsa Italiana S.p.A., which was followed in July by the exercise of the +*CC-EJ>@ption.

Revenues

Revenues amounted to 13,797 million euros, down 356 million euros (-2.5%) on 2014. The results for
2015 continued the trend of recovery in revenue and the progressive and structural improvement in the
Mobile business, thanks to the steady market share, the stabilization of ARPU levels, and the continued
growth of mobile Internet.

The trend in revenues shows the following changes in the sales segments compared to 2014:

(millions of euros) |

Consumer 7,255 7,329 (74)
Business 4,567 4,795 (228)
National Wholesale 1,779 1,786 (7)

In particular:

¥ : revenues for the Consumer segment in 2015 amounted to 7,255 million euros,

decreasing 74 million euros (-1.0%) compared to 2014, showing a trend of recovery driven, in

particular, by the progressive and structural recovery in the Mobile business, thanks to the steady

market share, the stabilization of ARPU levels, and continued growth of mobile Internet. In detail:

— revenues for the Mobile business came to 3,560 million euros and were slightly up on 2014
(+38 million euros, +1.1%), continuing the positive performance seen over two consecutive
quarters (fourth quarter 2015, +3.0%; third quarter: +3.6%, second quarter -1.4%; first
quarter -1.4%). Revenues from services fell by 38 million euros (-1.2% on 2014), although with a
significant trend of recovery (fourth quarter 2015: +1.8%; third quarter: -0.3%; second quarter: -
2.2%; first quarter: -4.5%), attributable to the easing of competitive pressure, the progressive
stabilization of market share, and the steady growth in Internet mobile and digital services
supporting the stabilization of the ARPU;

Telecom Italia S.p.A. Review of Operating and Financial Performance - Telecom Italia S.p.A.}| 95
Report on Operations
— Fixed-line revenues amounted to 3,696 million euros, decreasing 112 million euros compared to
2014 (-2.9%), with a slowdown in the last quarter of 2015 (-6.7%) of the improvement trend
recorded from the second half of 2014, thanks to ARPU development initiatives implemented in
the final months of the year (repricing, the introduction of flat tariffs, bundle development).

¥ : revenues for the Business segment amounted to 4,567 million euros, decreasing

228 million euros compared with the first quarter of 2014 (-4.8%). Revenues from services (4,207

million euros, -204 million euros compared to 2014) continued the stabilization trend that began

during 2014 (-4.8% in the fourth quarter 2015). In particular:

— the reduction in revenues from Mobile services in 2015 (-64 million euros, -5.6% compared to
2014) was mainly concentrated in the traditional mobile services for voice calls and messaging,
due to customer repositioning towards bundle deals with lower overall ARPU, only partially offset
by the positive performance of the new digital services, driven in particular by the mobile Internet
component;

— revenues from Fixed-line services (-143 million euros, -4.4% on 2014) continued to be affected
by the slow economic recovery, the reduction in prices on traditional voice and data services, and
the technological shift towards VoIP systems, partially rebalanced by the steady growth in ICT
revenues, particularly for Cloud services.

¥ revenues for the Wholesale segment in 2015 came to 1,779 million euros,
essentially stable compared to 2014 (-8 million euros, -0.4%). Indeed, the impact of the revision of
the regulated prices in 2015 was similar to the impact in 2014 due to the retroactive amendment of

the wholesale access prices for the period 2010-2012.

EBITDA

EBITDA was equal to 5,266 million euros (6,739 million euros in 2014), decreasing by 1,473 million
euros compared to 2014; the EBITDA margin was 38.2% (47.6% in 2014).

EBITDA in 2015 reflected the negative impact of non-recurring net expenses totaling 1,021 million
euros; without these expenses, the organic change in EBITDA would have been -6.8%, with an EBITDA
margin of 45.6%, down 2.1 percentage points on 2014. For more details, see the Note “Significant non-
recurring events and transactions” in the Separate Financial Statements of Telecom Italia S.p.A. at
December 31, 2015.

At the EBITDA level, in addition to the negative effects described in the commentary on revenues, there
was an increase in the acquisition of goods and services, as well as other operating expenses.

Acquisition of goods and services

Acquisitions of goods and services totaled 5,386 million euros, up 293 million euros (+5.8%) compared
to 2014 (5,093 million euros), essentially due to the presence of non-recurring expenses of 87 million
euros, without which other operating expenses would have increased by 206 million euros. Net of those
non-recurring costs, the increase was mainly due to higher purchases of equipment and handsets linked
to the increase in product sales and to hosting costs for the sites transferred to the subsidiary INWIT on
April 1, 2015.

Employee benefits expenses increased by 492 million euros compared to 2014; The main factors that
drove this change were:

¥

an increase of 75 million euros in ordinary employee expenses, mainly due to the increased
contractual minimum salaries - as established in the TLC National Collective Labor Agreement
signed on February 1, 2013, which set the pay-scale points effective from April and October 2014 -
and the growth in the average salaried workforce, following the termination in April 2015 of the
“Solidarity Contracts”, which were bringing a reduction in working hours and a consequent reduction
in the average salaried workforce. Compared to 2014, the average salaried workforce increased by
1,745 employees, with 1,843 average salaried employees connected to the solidarity contracts;

the recognition of charges, provisions to Employee benefits and other minor items of a non-recurring
nature, totaling 422 million euros, mainly related to specific agreements signed in 2015 with the
trade unions for the application of provisions of law that, from 2016 and subsequent years, will
enable the management of personnel surpluses, resulting from the streamlining processes affecting
all the companies operating in the TLC sector. These instruments will be implemented through
solidarity contracts, through voluntary early retirements (in application of Article 4, paragraphs 1-
7ter, of Law 92 of June 28, 2012, known as the “Fornero law”), and through the use of the mobility
scheme under Law 223/91.

More details are provided in the Note "Employee benefits expenses" of the Separate Financial
Statements at December 31, 2015 of Telecom Italia S.p.A..

The headcount at December 31, 2015 amounted to 44,171, an increase of 7 compared to December
31, 2014 (44,164).

Sundry expenses 27 37 (10)

Other operating expenses came to 960 million euros and were up 428 million euros compared to 2014,
mainly due to the presence of non-recurring expenses of 512 million euros, resulting from regulatory
disputes and penalties and the liabilities related to those expenses, expenses for disputes with former
employees, and liabilities with customers and/or suppliers. Without these expenses, other operating
expenses would have fallen around 84 million euros.

Depreciation, amortization and capital expenditure

Depreciation and amortization charges amounted to 3,083 million euros (3,190 million euros in 2014),
decreasing 107 million euros, with 64 million euros relating to the depreciation of tangible assets and
43 million euros to the amortization of intangible assets.

The reduction in was mainly due to the decrease recognized for BTS-Base Transceiver
Stations, resulting from the transfer to the company Infrastrutture Wireless S.p.A. (INWIT), on April 1,
2015, of the business unit consisting of around 11,500 sites that house the radio transmission
equipment for mobile telephone networks, as well as the revision of the useful lives of the BTSs from 13
to 28 years.

In addition, depreciation decreased by 13 million euros for buildings, as a result of the contractual
reformulation with consequent amendment of the residual useful lives of the leases as part of the
above-mentioned real estate project.

These reductions were offset by an increase of 18 million euros for UMTS/LTE equipment, also as a
result of the development work for the UltraBroadBand Networks.

The reduction in was essentially due to the change in amortization amounts for software
(resulting in a decrease of around 19 million euros in amortization charges) as well as the reduced
capitalization of Subscribers Acquisition Costs (SAC), resulting in a decrease of around 56 million euros
in amortization. The reduction in amortization was partially offset by an additional 31 million euros for
licenses due to the acquisition of the extension of the GSM license until June 30, 2018.

amounted to 3,645 million euros (2,693 million euros in 2014), increasing 952
million euros, with 523 million euros relating to the investments in tangible assets and 429 million euros
to investments in intangible assets. Specifically:
¥ capital expenditures in tangible assets increased mainly because of the development of the
ultrabroadband networks both in the fixed segment (next-generation networks - NGN) and the
mobile segment (LTE). The low-interest finance Eurosud and Digital Divide projects accounted for a
significant proportion of the capital expenditure on the fixed network;

¥ the increase in investments in intangible assets was mainly attributable to the cost for the extension
of the expiry of the GSM license for a total of 117 million euros, as well as the 231 million euros
investment connected to the acquisition of the user rights to the 1452-1492 MHz frequencies for
terrestrial electronic communications systems, awarded after participation in the tender called by
the Ministry of Economic Development. The rights were officially awarded on September 14, 2015;
they were definitively assigned in December 2015, while use of the band will begin in January 2016.

Gains (losses) on disposals of non-current assets

Gains/losses on disposal of non-current assets showed a gain of 5 million euros, mainly as a result of
the recognition of gains of 8 million euros - relating to the early termination of the long-term contract
pertaining to part of the Acilia complex in Rome acquired under finance lease - and of approximately 2
million euros deriving from the sale of the real estate property in Buenos Aires (Catalina tower), partially
offset by losses of around 5 million euros due to disposals of assets relating to the Base Transceiver
Station-BTS sites no longer used. In 2014, this item showed a gain of 31 million euros, including the
recognition of gains of 38 million euros, following the sale - which took place in March 2014 - of a
building owned by Telecom Italia, located in Milan.

Impairment losses on non-current assets

There were no impairment reversals (losses) on non-current assets in 2015 (as in 2014).

In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment at least
annually.

Accordingly, for the 2015 Annual Report, the Company conducted impairment testing of the
recoverability of goodwill based on the cash flow forecasts in the new 2016 - 2018 Industrial Plan. The
results of that testing, carried out in accordance with the specific procedure adopted by the Telecom
Italia Group, confirmed the amounts of the Goodwill allocated to the Group’s domestic operations.

A more detailed analysis is provided in the Note "Goodwill" in the Separate Financial Statements of
Telecom Italia S.p.A. at December 31, 2015.

EBIT

EBIT was positive and amounted to 2,188 million euros, decreasing 1,392 million euros on 2014 (3,580
million euros). The EBITDA margin rose from 25.3% in 2014 to 15.9% in 2015.

EBIT for 2015 was pulled down by a total of 1,021 million euros in non-recurring expenses, without
which the change in EBIT would have been -9.6%, with an EBIT margin of 23.3%. For more details, see
the Note "Significant non-recurring events and transactions" in the Separate Financial Statements of
Telecom Italia S.p.A. at December 31, 2015.

In particular, the following is noted:

¥ dividends mainly related to the subsidiary Telecom Italia International (2,000 million euros) for the
distribution of capital reserves, which took place in June 2015. In accordance with the accounting
standards, following this distribution, the value of the investee company was tested for
recoverability, which resulted in a write-down of 1,467 million euros. Dividends also included

Report on Operations
amounts received from Persidera S.p.A. (7 million euros) and Tierra Argentea (3 million euros);
dividends for 2014 mainly came from the company SIA (4 million euros);

¥ the impairment losses related for 2,369 million euros to the overall write-down of the investment in
the subsidiary Telecom Italia International and reflected:

— 1,467 million euros, for the impairment testing of the value of the investee company resulting
from the distribution of capital reserves, carried out in June 2015, as mentioned above;

— 902 million euros, for the impairment loss on the TIM Brasil group, of which Telecom Italia
International holds a controlling interest, mainly due to the macroeconomic and financial strains
in Brazil, which resulted in the need to adjust the carrying amount recorded in euro;

— the impairment losses also included the write-downs on the subsidiaries Persidera (-55 million
euros), Olivetti (-25 million euros), Tl Information Technology (-22 million euros) and Tierra
Argentea (-2 million euros). Impairment losses for 2014 related to write-downs of the
investments in the subsidiaries Telecom Italia Media (-63 million euros), Olivetti (-33 million
euros), TI Information Technology (-21 million euros), and Telecontact (-2 million euros) and in
the associate Tiglio | (-6 million euros);

¥ net gains consisted of 299 million euros for the gain, net of transaction costs, resulting from the
above-mentioned sale of the non-controlling interest, equal to 39.97% of the ordinary shares of

INWIT S.p.A., 18 million euros for the gain connected to the sale in December of the remaining the

investment in Teleleasing (in liquidation) and 11 million euros for the gain resulting from the sale in

July of the investment in SIA S.p.A..

Finance income (expenses)

Finance income (expenses) shows net expenses of 2,425 million euros (net expenses of 2,160 million
euros in 2014).

The performance resulted from the net effect of:

the reduction in finance expenses due to a decrease in the debt position, as well the effects of the
changes in certain non-monetary items, of a valuation and accounting nature, linked to the fair value
measurement of derivatives, in accordance with IFRS 13;

the negative impact of 454 million euros (174 million euros in 2014) relating to the fair value
measurement through profit and loss - performed separately to its liability component - of the
embedded option included in the mandatory convertible bond issued by Telecom Italia Finance S.A. at
the end of 2013, for 1.3 billion euros (“Guaranteed Subordinated Mandatory Convertible Bonds due
2016 convertible into ordinary shares of Telecom Italia S.p.A.”). This embedded option was initially
recognized in the financial statements of Telecom Italia Finance; having been used as equity settlement,
it was transferred at fair value on the financial statements of Telecom Italia S.p.A., simultaneously with
the approval by the Shareholders’ Meeting on December 20, 2013 of Telecom Italia share capital
increase;

a negative effect of 316 million euros in relation to the bond buybacks and two bond issues by Telecom
Italia Capital S.A. (maturing in June 2018 and June 2019), for a total of 3.8 billion euros. This impact
resulted from the difference between the buyback prices and the values of the liabilities at the
transaction date, net of the benefits from the termination of several hedging derivatives linked to the
bonds repurchased. In 2014, the negative impact of the buybacks carried out during the period and the
exercise of the early redemption option for a bond amounted to 62 million euros.

Income tax expense

This item amounted to 96 million euros, and fell by 574 million euros on 2014 (670 million euros)
mainly due to the lower tax base and the intervening full deductibility of labor costs from the IRAP tax
base introduced by Article 1 (20), of the 2015 Stability Law (Law no. 190/14) which resulted in a
reduction of around 60 million euros in IRAP tax.

Profit (loss) from Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for
sale

Net profit (loss) from discontinued operations/non-current assets held for sale shows a profit of 9 million
euros (7 million euros in 2014), relating to the dividends for the year 2015 from the company Sofora
Telecomunicaciones.

A more detailed analysis is provided in the Note "Discontinued operations/Non-current assets held for
sale" in the Separate Financial Statements of Telecom Italia S.p.A. at December 31, 2015.

Profit (loss) for the year

The loss for the year amounted to 456 million euros (profit of 636 million euros in 2014), due to the net
non-recurring expenses, the negative impact of bond buybacks during the first part of the year and a
number of items of a merely valuation and accounting nature that do not entail any monetary
settlement, related in particular to the fair value measurement of the embedded option included in the
mandatory three-year convertible bonds issued at the end of 2013. Without these impacts, the result for
the year 2015 for the Company would have been a profit of over 900 million euros.

(*) Includes the change in trade payables for amounts due to fixed asset suppliers.

The reduction in net operating free cash flow in 2015 compared to 2014 (-904 million euros) was mainly
due to the decrease in EBITDA (-1,473 million euros) and the higher capital expenditure requirement
(-952 million euros), partially offset by the change in working capital (+840 million euros) and in
particular of trade payables, as well as the change in employee benefits and operating provisions, which
reflected the above-mentioned non-recurring provisions made in 2015.

In addition to what has already been described with reference to EBITDA, the change in adjusted net
financial debt for 2015 has been particularly impacted by the following:

Flow of capital expenditures on an accrual basis

Capital expenditures amounted to 3,645 million euros (2,693 million euros in 2014), increasing 952
million euros, with 523 million euros relating to the investments in tangible assets and 429 million euros
to investments in intangible assets.

Sale of investments and other disposals flow

This was positive at 895 million euros in 2015 and consisted of:

¥ 854 million euros, of proceeds, already net of the related transaction costs paid, resulting from the
placement on the market of 39.97% of the share capital of Infrastrutture Wireless Italiane S.p.A.
(INWIT), which took place during the month of June 2015, followed, in July, by the exercise of the
greenshoe option;!

¥ 19 million euros from the sale of the investment in Teleleasing;

¥ 9 million euros from the sale of the company SIA S.p.A.;

¥ 2 million euros from the reimbursement of capital from the investment in Tierra Argentea.

Telecom Italia S.p.A. Report Review of Operating and Financial Performance - Telecom Italia S.p.A. | 104
on Operations
In 2014, this item amounted to 86 million euros and was mainly generated by the sale of the property
located in Milan, as well as the proceeds from the reimbursement of capital of the investment in Tierra
Argentea.

Financial investments flow

This item amounted to 111 million euros and mainly included contributions to the investment account,
to cover losses or subscriptions to capital increases in favor of the subsidiaries Olivetti (60 million
euros), Tim Tank former Olivetti Gestione Ivrea (10 million euros), Tl Information Technology (5 million
euros), Tierra Argentea (2 million euros), and Telecom Italia Ventures Capital (1 million euros). It also
included an outlay of 23 million euros for the acquisition of 50% of the share capital of the company
Alfiere S.p.A., a real estate company that owns several buildings in the EUR district of Rome that will be
used by Telecom Italia in the future as an administrative center.

In 2014, it amounted to 43 million euros and mainly included contributions of 17 million euros for
acquisition of control in Trentino NGN and 8 million euros for acquisition of direct control in Telecom
Italia San Marino.

Dividends flow

This item amounted to 1,847 million euros, representing the balance between dividends paid (166
million euros) and received (2,013 million euros).

Change in finance leasing contracts

This item represents the increased value of tangible assets under finance lease, reflecting also the
associated higher financial payables, posted mainly as a result of contractual renegotiations that took
place during 2015 as part of the above-mentioned project of transformation of real estate assets by
Telecom Italia S.p.A. (1,178 million euros). Further details are provided in the Note “Tangible assets
(owned and under finance leases)” of the Separate Financial Statements at December 31, 2015 of
Telecom Italia S.p.A..

Share capital increases/reimbursements, including incidental costs

In 2015, the amount of 186 million euros related to the valuation of the conversion option of the
1.125% unsecured equity-linked bond amounting to 2 billion euros, issued on March 26, 2015 and
maturing on March 26, 2022.

In particular, the amount of 186 million euros corresponded to the difference between the credit
received by bondholders following the issue of the bond and the debt component of the financial
instrument issued. The debt component is equal to the fair value of an identical liability issued by the
Company at market conditions but without the conversion right, while the remainder, up to the amount
of the credit received, was recognized as a component of shareholders' equity (the "residual method").

Finance expenses, income taxes and other net non-operating
requirements flow

Finance expenses, income taxes and other net non-operating requirements flow mainly includes the
payment of income taxes, net finance expenses, and the change in non-operating receivables and
payables.

Net financial debt

Net financial debt amounted to 32,055 million euros, decreasing 1,368 million euros compared to

In addition to the usual indicator (renamed "Net financial debt carrying amount"), another indicator is

The non-current portion of gross financial debt amounted to 30,743 million euros (30,010 million euros
at the end of 2014) and represented 84.5% of total gross financial debt.

In line with the Group's objectives in terms of debt composition and in accordance Guidelines adopted
for the "Management and control of financial risk", Telecom Italia S.p.A., in securing both third-party and
intercompany loans, uses IRS and CCIRS derivative financial instruments to hedge its liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments are designated as fair value hedges for managing exchange rate risk on
financial instruments denominated in currencies other than euro and for managing interest rate risk on
fixed-rate loans. Derivative financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges when the objective
is to fix the exchange rate and interest rate of future variable contractual flows.

Report on Operations
To provide a better representation of the true performance of Net Financial Debt, from 2009, in addition
to the usual indicator (renamed "Net financial debt carrying amount"), a measure called "Adjusted net
financial debt" has also been shown, which neutralizes the effects caused by the volatility of financial
markets. Given that some components of the fair value measurement of derivatives (contracts for
setting exchange and interest rates for contractual flows) and derivatives embedded in other financial
instruments do not result in actual monetary settlement, the "Adjusted net financial debt" excludes
these purely accounting and non-monetary effects (including the effects resulting from the introduction
of IFRS 13 - Fair Value measurement, from January 1, 2013) from the measurement of derivatives and
related financial assets/liabilities.

The sales of trade receivables to factoring companies finalized in 2015 resulted in a positive effect on
net financial debt at December 31, 2015 of 1,068 million euros (1,212 million euros at December 31,
2014).

SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF
OPERATIONS AND THEIR ECONOMIC ASPECTS

Telecom Italia plays a prominent role in the affairs of the countries in which it operates in view of the
increasing importance of communication technologies for people's lives and for the economic and social
development of communities. Changes taking place in the environment and society present economic
risks as well as business opportunities for the Group. Further analysis was carried out in 2015 to
determine the importance for the company of elements that are of interest to stakeholders ("materiality
analysis"). This confirmed the significant energy costs borne by Telecom Italia as well as the
opportunities created by new technologies, including the sale of services with environmental and social
impacts, such as services that allow households and businesses to reduce their energy consumption,
services with which cities can reduce their greenhouse gas emissions or, on the social side,
telemedicine or tele-education services. Among the issues regarded as material by stakeholders and the
company, the materiality analysis also highlighted issues relating to the defence of human rights. This
result, which may seem surprising for a telecommunications operator that works in countries considered
to be at low/medium risk of human rights violations, is based on two sets of reasons:
¥ the public outcry caused by any human rights violation incidents, which can seriously affect business
reputation;
¥ the very broad meaning given to the concept of "human right" by Telecom Italia - which includes not
only basic human rights, such as the right to a decent remuneration, non-discrimination, freedom
from forced labour, etc., but also rights associated with the information society, therefore the right to
access information and the right to have one's privacy and safety protected online, which are of
course material issues for a telecommunications company.
During the year, the Corporate Shared Value department wrote the "Respecting Human Rights in the
Telecom Italia Group" policy, with the support of the Global Compact Network Italy. The policy is available
on the telecomitalia.com website and the company intranet. A classroom training and information
course on human rights was also organised with the involvement of the departments most concerned by
the policy, in addition to an online course available to everyone in the company. The drafting of the policy
and the training course stem from the results of the due diligence that Telecom Italia has conducted in
recent years, involving the Domestic BU and Brazil BU.

The following are a few cases in which social and environmental elements have direct economic impacts
on Telecom Italia and, lastly, a brief description is provided of the materiality analysis, the details of
which are provided in the sustainability section of this Report.

Telecom Italia is the second largest consumer of electricity in Italy, with around 2® TWh of energy use
per year.

Technological developments launched in 2015, related mainly to the NGAN implementation plan and
LTE technology, are generally leading to an increase in energy consumption. 2015 in particular saw a
significant boost being given to the technological development of the fixed and mobile network and a
significant growth in new installations in the internal and external market in the field of Information
Technology, as well being characterised by exceptional weather conditions, with average temperatures,
during the summer months, well above the levels in 2014. All these factors resulted in a significant
increase in energy demand for both fixed and mobile communication.

This figure doesn t includlectricity consumed by OLOs.

Telecom Italia S.p.A. Social and environmental impacts of operations and their economic aspects | 119
Report on Operations
The increase in the demand for energy in 2015 was estimated to be approximately 165 GWh, 21% (35
GWh) of which was associated with the increase in temperatures. This increase was offset by the
savings made possible by a series of energy efficiency improvement measures undertaken and
completed in 2013 and 2014, as well as new measures undertaken and completed during 2015,
including, in particular, projects involving the replacement of obsolete equipment with new, more
efficient systems. A significant boost to electricity generation has been achieved by co- and tri-
generation - resulting in an estimated increase of 45 GWh on 2014 - implementing measures to improve
the efficiency of currently operating systems and bringing a further 6 into service, in addition to existing
ones. Overall, these measures have offset the increased demand from technological implementations
and achieved a 2 GWh reduction in consumption. The saving can be estimated to be around 10 million
euros over the course of the year.

Two ISO 50001 certified sites and one ISO 14064 certified site were confirmed in 2015.

The energy efficiency of Telecom Italia was also recognised by the award in 2015 of White Certificates
(TEE) for 34 projects, corresponding to around 40,000 TOE (Tonnes of Oil Equivalent) per year saved
and an estimated economic value at current prices of around 40 million euros over 5 years.

Telecom Italia pays great attention to listening and involving workers' representatives in many areas of
work, including reorganisation processes. This allows agreements to be reached for the implementation
of efficiency improvement plans that can mediate between the needs of the workers and those of the
company. In particular, a complex negotiation process involving the leading trade union organisations
was completed in late 2015 with the signing of a new framework agreement, which will apply from the
beginning of 2016, for the management of expected redundancies. The willingness to search for
dialogue between the parties guided this discussion too, and is tangibly demonstrated by the agreement
reached.

Like its predecessors, this Agreement also provides for the use of instruments that are not socially and
economically traumatic, including the use of Defensive Solidarity Contracts, as required by the Jobs Act,
combined with the strategic role of the training lever, as a pivotal element to encourage professional
retraining and requalification in order to counteract redundancies. Defensive Solidarity Contracts are
agreements that provide for working hours to be reduced in order to avoid downsizing. For the workers
to whom the contract will be applied, provision is made for INPS [social security] to make up part of the
remuneration not received due to the reduction in working hours. Furthermore, in order to alleviate the
economic hardship caused by the loss of remuneration, Telecom Italia has provided for company loans
to be granted at very favourable interest rates. Finally, the Agreement provides for Telecom Italia to pay
a variable one-off amount to workers covered by the Solidarity Contract at the end of the period and on
achievement of specific objectives associated with the redundancy plan.

The other instruments agreed between the Parties will allow redundancies to be minimised structurally
with early and voluntary departures under the mobility provisions of law 223/91 and article 4 of the so-
called Fornero Law.

The previous solidarity contracts expired in April 2015. The benefit on the cost of labour for 2015 was
44 million euros for the Group as a whole (145 million euros in 2014) and around 34 million euros for
Telecom Italia S.p.A. (124 million euros in 2014).

Currently, ICT services for environmental protection and improving the quality of life of citizens are still
niche services. However, they are seeing positive growth rates and are likely to be widespread in the
future. Telecom Italia's laboratories have long been engaged in researching and developing these kinds
of services, some of which are already being tested on the market. Thus customers already have a wide
range of solutions available to them to cut energy consumption, reduce CO2 emissions, improve health
services and bureaucracy, improve safety for citizens. The many services offered by Telecom Italia
(described at nuvolaitaliana.impresasemplice.it) on the environmental front include Nuvola It Energreen,
the energy management service platform which allows businesses and public organisations to monitor
their consumption and manage it efficiently and effectively through:

analysing the energy efficiency;

web portal for advanced reporting and setting alerts;

Energy Management advice services;

verifying the accuracy and consistency of supply contract bills.

~ MK OK

Monitoring consumption allows savings to be achieved of up to 8% of the total.

For Nuvola It Energreen alone, sales in 2015 were around 350,000 euros.

The market for videoconferencing solutions, which recorded a turnover of 8 million in 2015, remains
lively. Available in different commercial formulations, suitable for the requirements of small, medium
and large companies, with service levels and quality standards ranging from High Definition to
Telepresence, videoconferencing services can dramatically reduce the amount of travel, and therefore
CO2. Web-based solutions in particular are increasing both the availability of videoconferencing services
among SMEs and their penetration among larger companies, contributing to reducing emissions.

The Group remains committed to developing Digital Health services, designed to meet the needs of

doctors and patients in big public or private establishments, through:

x cloud platforms for tele-monitoring of the main vital signs, CE certified as medical devices, remote
consulting, remote emergency assistance, tele-diagnosis, tele-reporting and remote assistance for
patients;

x solutions for gathering and storing health information such as personal details, patient
classification, clinical parameter measurements, drug therapy, laboratory test results, x-rays,
individual patient specifications (which can also be viewed on tablets);

x legal management of diagnostic images (x-rays, ultrasound, CAT, NMR, etc.) and healthcare
documents (reports, certificates, etc.)

Digital Health services make organising and managing care activities easier, more effective and more

economical, and brings them closer to citizens. The value of these solutions in 2015 was 1.12 million

euros, almost half of them being Cloud solutions.

Many other vertical solutions are also available on the market that directly or indirectly contribute to

reducing consumption and emissions by optimising and improving the efficiency of activities. For

example, fleet location services which, by using GPS satellite location and integrated tools for managing
commercial vehicle fleets and planning movements, allow cost and fuel consumption to be optimised.

The series of Nuvola It Localizza, My Fleet Platform, Nuvola It Public Drive, Nuvola It Your WAY solutions

grew by 24% compared to 2014, reaching 6.2 million euros in 2015.

Process for identifying significant issues

Drawing from both national and international sources of information, Telecom Italia has identified
various sustainability-related topics to determine which of them are priorities for its stakeholders. These
topics were initially assessed from an internal point of view by the company's main departments involved
in the analysis process.

Telecom Italia S.p.A. Social and environmental impacts of operations and their economic aspects | 121

Report on Operations
The external point of view was assessed by organising a multi-stakeholder forum which made it easier
for the representatives of the various stakeholders involved to participate. The contributions received,
considering the various perspectives, provided an integrated and mediated vision of the various
expectations and priorities.

The forum was attended by over 30 representatives of institutions, associations, universities, schools,
start-ups, customers and suppliers of the Group, who were split up into themed groups based on their
interests and skills. At the end of this initial screening, Telecom Italia was able to draw up a list of
relevant topics representing the following macro areas:

x direct and indirect economic impacts;

business ethics and promotion of human rights;

responsible management of the supply chain;

risk management and Public Policy;

Assessing the results of the analyses carried out allowed the topics to be put in order of priority and the
materiality matrix for the Group to be created. In particular, both the external stakeholders and the
Company stressed the importance of innovations in services, including those with social and
environmental connotations, and the management of sensitive data and child protection. In contrast,
energy consumption was extremely important for the company, but less important for external
stakeholders.
